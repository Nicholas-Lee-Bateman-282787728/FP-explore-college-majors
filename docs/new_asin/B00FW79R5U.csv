6033738,3,B00FW79R5U,"Not a big fan of the Baldwins, this would have been a better movie if a better actor had done the part. The story and the message is there but the movie suffered from the poor acting. I love Christmas movies and music and watch every movie at Christmas time. If you like the Baldwins you will like this movie.",1484006400,,309,4.166666666666667

6033749,3,B00FW79R5U,"The storyline was decent, but the directing, acting, and video was not very good at all.  It was difficult to watch the entire moving",1482969600,,133,4.541666666666667

6033755,1,B00FW79R5U,"Could not get past the first five minutes,it looks like it was filmed on a home movie camera and the cast was all of the family members.",1482537600,,136,4.074074074074074
6033756,1,B00FW79R5U,"Bad production, acting, and plot. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! The four star rating is very misleading! We kept watching hoping that it would get better and it never did.",1482451200,,165,4.533333333333333
6033757,3,B00FW79R5U,"I'd have to rank this Christmas movie as just okay, nothing that special, at least to me.  I'm not a big fan of any of the Baldwin Clan, but would say that Alex displays the most talent of the three, but this was Daniel's movie.  A typical boring story line that we've all seen before in many other movies of this type, just many of those were done a bit better.  I have to admit I didn't finish watching this movie, actually fell asleep right in the middle.  For the record, I love most Christmas movies, just some better than others.  For me this one would have to rank towards the bottom of the list.  It's worth a look as YOU might actually enjoy this film.",1482364800,,661,4.2063492063492065

6033762,4,B00FW79R5U,A good Christmas movie that helps us to rethink priorities and put family first.  Can't say much more than that or it will be giving away too much.  Watch and enjoy!,1481328000,,165,4.290322580645161

6033765,4,B00FW79R5U,"With a setting in a small American town, this movie broaches a modern day problem that affects families today.  It has a family theme and is suitable for holiday watching.  Many family themes are included such as the protection of a father for his son; the relationships between long lost loved ones; the past and how it melds with the present and the future; And lessons learned along the way.  The music and Christmas decor are  heartwarming and captures the Christmas spirit.  Sweet and enlightening.  GL",1450569600,,507,4.837209302325581
6033766,2,B00FW79R5U,"I don't like to say negative things about a movie, but I found this one amateurish and downright dreary.  There are better ways of putting a message into a movie.  The message here -- to spend more time with family -- is certainly not bad, but I watched this through from start to finish only to give it a chance, any chance.  Yeah, it doesn't use any swearing or things that you don't want your kids to see.  But it was downright depressing.  Everyone in it seemed to have nothing but problems.",1449705600,3,495,4.336956521739131
6033767,5,B00FW79R5U,"This is a good family-oriented movie with a moral. Sometimes we tend to put other things ahead of our family, which should not be the case. This is like a wake-up call. My brother and I appear in this movie as extras. I enjoyed working in it. The main actors and film crew were very friendly and easy to work with.",1419465600,,314,4.163934426229508
6033768,1,B00FW79R5U,"I love a good Christian, Christmas movie, but this was awful. The acting was atrocious and the film looked like it was recorded by a phone.
I agree that we need more faith based films, but I do not agree with a 5 star rating simply because it's Christian. It's not accurate and I don't appreciate spending my hard earned money on a lie. As you can see, I find it rather upsetting. I didn't last beyond twenty minutes.
So please do us all a favor and rate accordingly, so your fellow Christians know what they are getting.",1419379200,3,521,4.326530612244898

6033770,5,B00FW79R5U,"The story was okay, but the real reason I give this movie 5 stars is because my brother is in it.  He plays the man in the black suit.",1401926400,2,134,3.6206896551724137
6033771,3,B00FW79R5U,A very sweet movie.  I enjoyed the story it told along with a lesson on keeping your family and friends first in your life.,1395964800,,123,4.125
6033772,2,B00FW79R5U,"Very flat and, overall, lacking life and zest.  The only actor that brought some zest to his character was Gib Gerard.  Daniel Baldwin seemed completely out of his element and gave a lack luster performance.  The total movie reminded me of a medieval painting in its lack of depth and dimension.",1389139200,2,295,4.745098039215686

6033776,5,B00FW79R5U,Huge fan of Daniel Baldwin and came across this movie here on Amazon.  It really put us in the holiday spirit and had a great message.  We would definitely recommend it!,1383091200,5,169,4.419354838709677

8618855,3,B00FW79R5U,"I thought it was going to be terrible to watch after the first 10 minutes, and it got confusing for most of the way, but it seemed to somewhat make sense in the end.  Overall, it was okay and I'm glad I watched the whole movie, but some of the story just didn't fit.  Wouldn't recommend.",1513123200,,287,4.107142857142857
8618856,5,B00FW79R5U,"This movie couldn't have been made worst if they tried. Acting, directing, filming, and editing all were terrible. The only reason we watch this movie is to watch the utter ridiculousness of a the failure of this film. If you play it in slow motion it can give you a good laugh. Our children can't stand this movie which is the reason why it's become a family tradition.",1511827200,,370,4.455882352941177
8618857,1,B00FW79R5U,I made it through almost 8 minutes. That's all. The camera work reminded me of that from the Blair Witch Project and the acting was awful.,1507075200,,138,4.346153846153846
8618858,5,B00FW79R5U,Great movie. I watched it being filmed. Very good story about family being  more important than a job.,1506988800,,102,4.666666666666667
8618859,2,B00FW79R5U,"I have a great tolerance for low budget films as long as the story is there. With this film I had no idea what the story or message was-- ""spend more time with the family"" ?? ""Life is short"" ?? The message was not clear during the conversations he had with the various people.

Overall, Daniel and the various actors from his ""past"" did a fairly decent job. However, a few of the other actors throughout the movie were just terrible.

Also, the side story (kidnappings)  thrown into the movie made no sense.",1503360000,,507,4.43010752688172
8618860,1,B00FW79R5U,"This movie is so bad. It might have been a good interesting story, but I'll never know. The acting was just too horrible. And I do have a great tolerance for B rated movies, but not for this one. It was just that bad.",1499299200,,217,3.9545454545454546
8618861,5,B00FW79R5U,Kids enjoyed it very much. My 7 year old keep telling us to think about Santa al the time so he wouldn't disappear. Lol.,1485820800,,120,4.041666666666667
