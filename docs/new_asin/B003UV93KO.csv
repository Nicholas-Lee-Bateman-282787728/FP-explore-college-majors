The costumes were fantastic.  The chorus was huge so with their synchronized stage movements it was quite a spectacle.  The story itself was intricate and draws you in. Although it is tragic and made me cry, the writer also makes you appreciate the sacrifice made by the official who rescues the orphan.  I would recommend this film to anyone interested in music and to anyone who has a Chinese friend.",1343952000,,558,4.831578947368421
