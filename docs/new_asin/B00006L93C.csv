7970996,5,B00006L93C,"I work for a video resale company and came across this video while at work. I was able to borrow it for a night to watch.  My husband, who is a high school girls basketball coach, loved the movie.  The theme is wholesome and there is minimal profanity.  The message is a good one...  use your gifts.  Some might think that this video is hokey but it has a deeper meaning to it and it is definately worthwhile.",1160956800,2,409,4.1923076923076925

7970998,5,B00006L93C,"This movie has a good moral message about being yourself and loving yourself despite how others may feel about you.  Dempsey Pappion and Gregory Hines work brilliantly together, hopefully this will not be the last time I will see Dempsey Pappion in a movie.  I thought his acting was very good, also, I will miss the talents of Gregory Hines who is no longer in the present.  But this is a movie that shows how talent Gregory was in front of the camera and behind the scenes directing, you will be missed!................peace!",1096070400,,527,4.706521739130435
