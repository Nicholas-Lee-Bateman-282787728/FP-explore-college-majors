1068451,5,6305764352,"Tommy Castro in 5.1 Dolby Digital is probably the coolest thing I own on DVD.  It's like they're playing in my living room!  This is the closest thing to a live show that you can get without being there... and trust me  I've seen probably over 100 live shows!  If you are a fan of contemporary  rock n' soul blues, this is the DVD for you!  These boys really know how to  deliver and they have a stage presence like you wouldn't believe.  Hot Hot  Hot! :)",956275200,8,455,4.137931034482759
1068452,4,6305764352,"A must have for anyone who enjoys the blues.  Good video presentation of a very tight and talented blues band. After my introduction to the Tommy Castro band live in concert,opening for Robert Cray in january 2000,the  only reason I could not give it 5 stars is that it's to short at only 60  minutes. It leaves you wanting more.  I also highly recommend all of their  cd's",951264000,9,373,4.426470588235294

7894249,5,6305764352,Saw Tommy Castro & The Painkillers for the first time at the Doheney Blues Fest in Dana Point CA yesterday 5/22/2016 and I must say that even though I was workin' security I was blown away by the next to last song that he played although I do not remember the title to it he played for something like 7 plus minutes if not longer this killer instrumental riffing that just had me movin' and shaking my legs because I thought that it was phenomenal and I would like to hear it again and again so I don't know if it was a new song that was just from the relatively new Painkillers stuff. The presentation was top notch.,1463961600,,617,4.19327731092437

7894251,5,6305764352,There's got to be scientific evidence linking Tommy Castro's guitar playing and the stirring of the soul! This concert of his is amazing!,1397952000,,137,5.0
7894252,4,6305764352,"Not his best show ever but compared to some other ""blues bands"" on the road it's a strong 11. Band is tight, vocals are spot on and his style is electric. Good video and sound for the venue. One of my most ""watched"" at parties videos. Stellar on our 52 inch plasma!",1212192000,2,265,4.115384615384615
7894253,4,6305764352,"I'm a big Tommy Castro fan, especially the earlier stuff and that's what you get here. Tommy and the band sound great, the sound mix is good but what disappoints is that you only get half or part of the show, just 10 songs with total running time less than a hour long. The extra's include some bio stills and a short six minute interview with Tommy and not much else. The set list could have been much stronger, but again keep in mind this is not the entire concert. I enjoy this disc more each time I play it and I suggest if you're a fan to check it out anyway and enjoy the show.",1182902400,,583,4.0344827586206895
7894254,3,6305764352,"I'm not sure ... I've listened to Tommy Castro for a long time, so I figured I'd get this video. Just seems to be lacking something, but is still most enjoyable.",1140825600,,161,4.225806451612903
7894255,5,6305764352,"This is my favorite band. I love my Stevie Ray Vaughn stuff, but it's tough to not have anything new come out of your favorite artist, like ever again. With the Tommy Castro band I'm able to see how they change as time goes on. A great live band, this DVD catches some of their great hits with incredible sound. Make sure you have the 5.1 audio mix on, it literally sounds like you're there. My favorite performance on this disc is 'Nobody Loves Me Like My Baby', which didn't make it onto the CD version. Likewise I was disappointed though to find that they didn't include 'sex machine' by James Brown on the DVD, which was on the CD release of this live performance.",1027382400,4,668,4.352
7894256,5,6305764352,"Tommy Castro revisit for us the soul music and the rock music in a great performing show, with a very efficacious rhythmics section. A great moment of happiness.",995414400,3,161,4.785714285714286
7894257,4,6305764352,"This DVD is a must if you are in to Tommy Castro and his band. The song selection could of been better but overall this DVD is pretty cool. Note, Some of the songs on the CD are not on this DVD.",981244800,3,194,3.642857142857143
