1211306,3,B00000FE1K,"If you're a fan of Debbie Reynolds or Suzanne Pleshette (or both), you'll love BATTLING FOR BABY (aka. ""Raising Trouble""), a fun comedy which also has an early appearance from Courteney Cox-Arquette.

Warring ex-best friends Marie (Suzanne Pleshette) and Helen (Debbie Reynolds) find themselves back in each others' lives when their grown-up children (Courteney Cox-Arquette and John Terlesky) get married and have a baby.  At first, the baby causes an hilarious tug-of-war for the two acid-tongued women, before they slowly mend the rift which parted them.

This is an enjoyable comedy caper which moves at a brisk pace and features strong performances from Pleshette and Reynolds, both clearly relishing their tightly-written comedy roles.  Courteney Cox-Arquette (around six years before she found worldwide fame on TV's ""Friends"") is a wonderful presence here, too.  The cast also includes Leigh Lawson and Mary Jo Catlett.

The DVD from Direct Source Special Products is nicely-priced and offers a reasonable transfer.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1202169600,5,1059,5.622641509433962
