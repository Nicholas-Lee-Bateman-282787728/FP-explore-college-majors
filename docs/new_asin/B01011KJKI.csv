7296471,5,B01011KJKI,"Faith. It's something we all search for and find in life whether that be faith in family, work or religion. In this film, I really thought the storyline accurately depicted how someone can come to terms with faith and accept it into their lives as a part of who they're. The cast did an amazing job of acting like average people just trying to find their way in life and this is what made it so believable as a viewer.

7296475,5,B01011KJKI,"I recently purchased several films supposed to be in the Christian genre. However, this is the ONLY film to talk about Jesus being the only way to God and heaven in a very reverent and essential way. People just don't realize that believing in Jesus as your Lord and Saviour is the only decision that we make that has eternal bearing. Many films just haphazardly mention the word ""god"" and end up being touted a Christian movie, but this is the only one that truly delivers! For those who care about guarding their eyes and ears, there was no nudity, violence, vulgarity, immodest dressing in this film. I was refreshed by this movie's reverence for the blessed Trinity. Of all the movies I bought this was my favorite! No lukewarm gobbledygook about placing your faith in what you can do. Jesus is the answer! The answer is not in placing our faith in our faith, but placing the faith God gives us in God Himself. The other movies I purchased were: Rust, Where hope grows, Hoovey, Do You Believe, Different Drummers, and some others... and yes, this movie, to me, was the best little gem in the field... I  love the part of the Gramma!",1455494400,33,1136,4.541463414634146

7296479,4,B01011KJKI,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  I have a family member who was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr syndrome, so parts of this movie really hit home. For the most part, I thought the acting was decent, and I enjoyed watching the moments between Rose and her granddaughter. There are two reasons I didn't give it five stars.  One, though it's a Christian movie, the Christian message seemed to be, ""Give yourself to Jesus and all your problems will be solved,"" which isn't what the Bible promises.

All the early believers and apostles - and even the Lord Jesus himself - had quite a lot of trouble in their lives.  God is ultimately victorious, but that doesn't mean that trouble on this earth will all disappear once a person comes to salvation.  We live in a fallen world. One day, God will remake the world as it will meant to be, and there will be no more death, or pain, or suffering, but right now, they are a part of our existence.  What God promises is that he will be there with us as we suffer, and he will allow us to lean on him, and somehow, he will use these painful experiences for good, whether it be for our good, or the good of others.  I wish the movie had discussed that, and gone into more depth about what it means when a person surrenders their heart to Christ.

Secondly, the end of the movie seemed rushed.  I would have liked to see the characters actually decide to follow Christ, and I would have liked to see more of Rachels recovery.  Instead, these things were implied, rather than spelled out, and it leaves you feeling like you missed some important developments.  Similarly, I would have liked to know more about Rachels mother.  Its also not clear how Rose speaks with her deceased husband.  Honestly, I think the film could have done without his ghost, and had Rose learn of her impeding death another way.

But, those issues aside, it was an enjoyable film for the most part, and I would watch it again.",1503014400,,1932,4.467236467236467
7296480,5,B01011KJKI,"Loved this movie!  Super uplifting, inspiring, wholesome and great for the whole family.  Teaches positive, Godly values.  :-)  Wish Amazon would have a way to search for Christian or spiritual movies.",1499385600,4,201,5.387096774193548
7296481,3,B01011KJKI,"Those hostile to Christianity hate it. Biblically sound Christians find it disturbing. Most agree it's sappy, predictable, amateurish, rushed at the end, and characters act nonsensically. But if you can get past that then it's a sweet movie.",1497398400,2,241,5.368421052631579
7296482,2,B01011KJKI,Blah,1497139200,,4,4.0
7296483,3,B01011KJKI,"Pros: Nice overall story line with a general religious influence. Some scenes were well done. For instance the lake scene was touching and felt genuine. Same with the scene where they talk about Rachel's mother (though I would have preferred a little more Rachel getting angry and more drama about why she won't believe in God). Which leads to the
Cons: I forgive bad acting in faith-based movies, because usually they have such small budgets, and I don't think the actors themselves did a bad job. It was the plot holes EVERYWHERE, especially at the end. It left an unsatisfied feeling since SPOILER ALERT they are basically breaking up when the girl can't move even though she thought she was getting better and basically told him she'd be better then says she lied. (after one really great date he is practically ready to marry her...yeah he says he allowed himself to fall in love...dumb and not believable since the whole 1 week they know each other he is trying to avoid her since she reminds him of his wife and he is still grieving) and then 1 month later after granny dies( it isn't really shown also disappointing), it magically cuts to them being all peachy keen kissing on the porch and there it ends. The whole story line needs more fleshing-out along with more individual character development. It would have been more interesting. Again though that is probably due to budgeting issues.",1496707200,,1400,4.765432098765432
7296484,5,B01011KJKI,I couldn't help but like it - these are real world situations.,1496534400,,62,4.25
7296485,4,B01011KJKI,I think this movie was really great up until the end. The end just seemed rushed and overly dramatized. Like they were trying to push the Lord in right at the last minute and weren't really sure how they were going to go about doing it. It may have played out better if her grandmother had been mentioning the Lord the whole time. It just made it sound pushy and rushed the way they played it out at the end. I really loved the movie and thought everything was going great until the ending. I almost question the rush job they put on the grandmother passing away. It may have been better to give it a month or so after the girl had recovered for the grandmother to pass away.,1496534400,3,675,4.2
7296486,3,B01011KJKI,"It's worth watching...Kinda ""cheezy"" if you will.  It has a good message to it, have a little faith, we need that now days more than ever!! It's a cute story, watch it and you'll see!",1495929600,,183,4.228571428571429
7296487,5,B01011KJKI,"I have to agree with other reviewers that the acting in this movie is rather mediocre. HOWEVER, the story itself is so touching, it is easy to forgive the deficiencies in the actors' and actresses' performance.

The movie exhibits an obviously Christian message, but some Christian viewers might be troubled by the idea that an old woman's deceased husband appears to her and talks with her about her impending departure from this world.

I liked this movie so much that I want to buy a copy so I can watch it again and again.",1495411200,3,526,4.585106382978723
7296488,3,B01011KJKI,"It easily could have been a good movie but the overall film was worse than any good lifetime movie I've seen. There were way too many plot holes (she's supposed to be in therapy, she never is) also the grandmother never drives at the beginning then all the sudden she's gone every day leaving the granddaughter? Just too many empty spaces that should have been filled instead of the over dramatic's of attempting to reveal a piece, and instead not saying anything, and leaving you to guess or assume what they're trying to tell you, which in reality, has nothing to do with the actual plot. Just an overall mess and not put together well at all.",1494201600,,645,4.521367521367521
7296489,2,B01011KJKI,Started well but  developed in cheesy way. The ending was especially weak. I will not recommend this movies at all. It was over rated.,1494028800,,134,4.583333333333333
7296490,5,B01011KJKI,"There are usually negative reviews on Christian movies where people complain about the acting or quality of production, but I generally ignore them. I loved this little movie because it brings a message of redemption, which is what Christ did for us on the cross... He died for our sins, and there is life in Him. I would rather see a low-budget Christian themed movie than one where I know an outrageous amount of money had been spent to impress beyond the message.",1493424000,5,466,4.626506024096385
7296491,2,B01011KJKI,So much was missing in this movie. It was predictable and had no drama.,1492732800,,71,4.142857142857143
7296492,5,B01011KJKI,"Sweet Movie! The story line runs a little fast, but it in no way takes away from the the story in totality. I found the grandmother to be very endearing and she definitely won me over! This movie stirred a kind sweetness in me that I hadn't expected. I would watch it again.",1491609600,,274,4.188679245283019

7296494,1,B01011KJKI,"It was a sappy, simplistic, Christian advertisement.  The acting was worse than a high school play.........No work went into this film.  The only thing redeeming is how hard the grandmother worked at getting around.  I give the actress credit.",1490486400,,243,5.17948717948718

Horrible acting, worse directing, and zero cinematography.

7296501,2,B01011KJKI,I felt the story was lacking depth. It was frustrating that particularly during the ending they rushed the relationship aspect. **Spoilers***You see her looking at the man and his truck at the cemetery after they are no longer together. Next thing you know he's walking up the steps to her aunts house and they are kissing. What!??? I hate when movies leave out huge plot points.,1489104000,,379,4.757575757575758

7296513,4,B01011KJKI,I don't really watch Christian movies where God is mentioned every few minutes but this movie really hit the spot.

7296514,3,B01011KJKI,"Before All Others could have been a great movie, instead it was slow, the acting could have been better -though the Grandma was quite entertaining --she seemed the most realistic, especially with her physical struggles.  The movie needed more oomph--it was flatter than a flapjack.
Again, it moved to slow, too lightly addressed the characters situations, plus lacked real conflict and passion. Seemed like a student movie made in a hurry.

I can't imagine what it would be like to loose any of my abilities to move and take care of myself.

7296605,5,B01011KJKI,"I'M HIGHLY LIKELY NEVER TO FORGET THIS ""LITTLE"" MOVIE.  NO HOLLYWOOD STARS ON THE A-LIST EARNING MILLIONS; JUST HOME-SPUN ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WHO WANT TO DELIVER A STORY TO YOU THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND FROM THE HEART... AND MEDICINE FOR THE SOUL.  *SURE, IT'S A BIT ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES BUT SO IS SANTA CLAUS BUT THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP ON SANTA DO NOT WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.*
AND THAT IS WHY I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS MOVIE.  THAT IS WHY THIS MOVIE IS  A PART OF ME FOREVER BECAUSE I AM ''GRANDMA'' AND THE SCRIPT DESCRIBES HER ''''RIGHT ON'''''.
BUT I HAVE A HUGE ""BONE"" TO PICK WITH THE MOVIE MAKERS.  I HAVE LOST MY STREAM OF JOY FOR THE MOVIE BECAUSE I JUST NOTICED THAT ''''DESCRIPTION'''' OF THE MOVIE (UP TOP) BY THE ""trailer"" BUTTON.
''''A young woman's world is turned upside down when she is struck with a paralyzing disease and forced to live with her estranged grandmother who she hasn't seen since she was a little girl. Rose, a widowed and ''''''''lonely senior''''''', finds ''''a new purpose in life'''': to fix ''''a 20-year-old family secret''''.

I THINK THE MOVIE IS """"""MODERN"""""""" BECAUSE IT PURPOSEFULLY SHOWED GRANDMA TO BE ''CRIPPLED'' BUT NOT ''''DISABLED'''''.  IT SHOWED GRANDMA LIVING IN A QUIET VILLAGE WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF ALL THE PEOPLE ....AND GRANDMA IS A REGULAR AT THE CHURCH AND HAS HERSELF A FULL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.  *AND, BECAUSE OF HOW HER BODY FELT, SHE KNEW HER TIME TO GO WAS NEAR.  SHE WOULD GO TO THE SHED AND TALK HER PASSING WITH HER BELOVED DEAD HUSBAND'S SPIRIT.  *BUT GRANNY WAS NOT LONELY AND IT IS AN INSULT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO SAY THAT.  GRANNY WAS HAPPY KNOWING VERY WELL SHE WAS GOING TO HEAVEN EXCEPT FOR """"""ONE"""""" FLAW.
 (IF YOU ARE YOUNG YOU MIGHT CALL GRANNY ECCENTRIC AND CRAZY.  IF YOU ARE OLD YOU ARE LIKELY TO SAY: ""I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THAT.  SHE SPEAKS TO HER LIFE-LONG LOVE."")
  THE MOVIE SHOWED GRANDMA TO BE ANYTHING BUT '''LONELY'''.  BUT IT DID SHOW SHE HAD LITTLE USE FOR A PHONE BUT ONE DAY HER GRANDCHILD WAS ABLE TO REACH HER ON THAT PHONE.  IN SHORT, THERE WAS NOTHING PITIFUL ABOUT GRANDMA, BUT THERE WAS PLENTY OF LOVE FROM GRANDMA.
*THIS MOVIE WAS SO RIGHT-ON THAT IT METICULOUSLY SHOWED THE YOUNG WOMAN TOOK A LONG TIME TO REALIZE THAT HER GRANDMA WAS SACRIFICING HERSELF TO TAKE CARE OF HER BECAUSE SHE LOVED HER AND HER MOTHER.

BUT LIKE IN ALL LIFE AND FAMILY STORIES THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ONE DAY HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  (THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS EDUCATED) SO THE PROBLEM OF LONG AGO WAS SOLVED RIGHT AWAY WHEN GRANDMA TOLD HER.  *AND... THE BIG DESTRUCTIVE ISSUE IN THIS STORY?  GRANDMA'S DAUGHTER WAS '''AN UNWED'''' MOTHER.

*THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO ME BECAUSE MY FAMILY HAD SUCH A PROBLEM IN OUR FAMILY STORY AND '''THE CULTURE BACK THEN''' TORE THE WHOLE FAMILY APART.  THE STORY-LINE ENDS UP INTERESTING.  I HAD ISSUES WITH THE UNWED MOTHER UNTIL I CAME IN CONTACT WITH ANTHROPOLOGY.  I LEARNED HOW THE HUMAN WORLD TREATS UNWED MOTHERS ALL OVER THE PLANET AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.  I DON'T THINK ''''THAT FACTOR'''' IN HUMANE LIVING WILL EVER GO AWAY.  BUT IN MODERN TIMES: WE TRY.  WE TRY.
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAY TO OUR UNWED MOTHER THAT ""IT'S OKAY""....'''LIVE YOUR LIFE, RAISE YOUR KID AND KEEP HOPE ALIVE AND ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS.""  AND I WOULD TELL HER TO KEEP SKELETONS IN HER CLOSET...IF SHE WAS STILL YOUNG AND HERE.  PEOPLE ARE NOT THAT FORGIVING.  BUT GOD IS FORGIVING.
*AS YOU CAN SEE...THIS MOVIE WAS A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME.",1485302400,4,3488,4.513556618819777

The first time was this very illness GBS.  I still can't believe the odds and it is hard to let it come forward in my brain.  I do agree
w/one reviewer that the illness was underacted and understated.  One star off for that reason.  She was left w/some of the after
effects for the rest of her life.  It shortened her life.  It does not affect everyone the same.  I believe stress can add a lot.  They also
did not talk about the diagnosis enough or what medicine does know about the disease.  It can be researched at y/interest.  Many
times after major surgery the neurologist stated to us as the immune system is down.  I was pleased to see a movie deal with it
at least.  I think the Grandma should have been able to stay around longer just as my Mom.  Grandma should have been able
to enjoy her Grandaughter healthy as well as sick.  Performance by Grandma took my troubles away for awhile!!!!",1484697600,,1030,4.324607329842932

she didn't accept Christ, Grandma chose Church over her daughter and would do so again, Grandpa ruled with an iron fist and please do remember that the man should always be the one in charge and the final say,  all bad things happen to you because you don't accept Jesus, but when you do, all your problems miraculously go away.",1484524800,2,496,4.625

The script was jarring, stilted, illogical and frankly trite in a way that made all my teeth want to jump out of my head and grate the writer rather than each other, apparently dentine is more sensitive than the moron that somehow managed to clasp a pencil in his simian paws to write this drivel.  And the God stuff? Oh my lord, if he actually existed even he/she/it would have baulked at the bold assertion that letting god into your heart would a) heal a rare and debilitating motor neurone disease, b) heal your alcoholism and c) create the gift of love in your heart. Truly the worst film I have ever seen. All of the people involved should find careers that add value, and it's not in movies... I suggest basejumping.

More importantly, if this was intended as a Christian movie it fails miserably, as the religious parts are so weak doctrinally that they're meaningless.  Part way through the movie, I said to my wife, ""It's like someone tried to make a Christian movie, but they don't understand Christianity.""  The Gospel is not presented. No message of Christ and his sacrifice for sin, just a vague idea of ""turn your life over to God"" or ""invite God into your life.""  I am an Evangelical Christian, but movies like this one do more to turn people off to Christianity than convert them to it.  If we're going to present the Gospel, it needs to be made plain, and it needs to be well-done.  This movie was not.",1483056000,12,773,4.688888888888889

7296829,4,B01011KJKI,"A young female dentist is stricken with Guilliane-Barre Syndrome and, rejecting the idea of a nursing home, must recuperate at her grandmother's cabin.  They have not seen each other in many years, and the grandmother (who is a likeable character) has trouble herself getting around.  I liked the humorous parts in the movie, and I liked all the characters.  I did find trouble in the lack of research that was given GBS.  The doctor in the movie said the woman would need to be taken care of totally.  All the grandmother did was let her lean on her to help her in and out of her wheelchair.  I don't know where the writer got the facts for GBS, but it is very,very rare and I don't think 98% of the cases recover totally.  It is a life-threatening disease.  The doctor explained it correctly in theory, but it just keeps going after the nerve cells, beginning with the extremeties, until eventually it paralyzes the breathing.  I'm sure everybody that has had GBS had it in varying degrees.  But I think they should have made it clear how rare it is and how a person with it may not make it, in part due to it being rare and it's like the last thing doctors test for - and meanwhile it's progressing.  My husband almost died from it.  He had to go to a specialty hospital and was given these very expensive bags thru a tube that somehow cured him.  The woman stricken in the movie didn't even have a physical therapist coming to her grandmother's home.  It showed her after some time on the floor doing exercises by herself.  This would have been much more touching - and interesting to the public about this disease - if it had taken on the subject of GBS in the hellish glare a patient of it is, or could be, in.",1482019200,6,1716,4.369085173501578

Mediocre acting and unrealistic ""happy ending."" Dislike and disagree with the closeminded thinking religious message.

The lesson that accepting Christ cures all ills is a tough sell to anyone who hasn't done it... I liked the message of servanthood. That was handled well.

And the sharing of the true gospel is presented in a profound way. I laughed, cried and praised the Lord while watching this movie. And as someone who has also experienced life changing health issues with devastating challenges, I can say that if it wasn't for my faith and personal relationship with my Lord, I would be in the same frame of mind of the young man in this movie Ben,  before he was truly saved and gave his life to the Lord.

Ten years after contracting this, I'm still hobbled and weakened (I have the chronic form, called CIDP), but most people have better recoveries.

There were definitely some tear producing moments in the show, and given this genre of Christian movies, which tend to be lower budget, I think it was a nice film.  I do think they could have done a better job fleshing out the story so you were more involved with what was going on.  It seemed liken things changed pretty fast in story line, but you weren't sure how much time had passed.  Medically, the story was off base, but I try to ignore obvious medical mistakes in movies unless it detracts from the point of the story.  In this case, it did not, so it was easy to overlook.  The ending was kind of a surprise, I'm not sure I would have went in that direction if I were the writer, as I think a happier ending would have been better, maybe with more focus on Ben and Rachel getting married or at least showing them all in church together.  Overall, it was a nice heart warming movie for a cold winter night.  If you go into it with realistic expectations, you will enjoy it.",1513209600,2,1061,4.2388059701492535
