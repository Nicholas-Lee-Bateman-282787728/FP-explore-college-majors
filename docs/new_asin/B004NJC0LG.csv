4436171,5,B004NJC0LG,"I work in the area of Vietnam War studies, and this is an excellent resource for both that war, and for a perspective on how it is still with American citizens today.  Bringing forward the mixed feelings of parents-children of different wars is good for us to hear.",1382918400,3,265,4.520833333333333
4436172,5,B004NJC0LG,"This DVD touch's home in more ways than one so it's hard to leave a exact review.  I'm an Iraq Vet, my Father-Vietnam.  The Titus Family in the Video, the only family shown that lost a relative...  SPC Brandon Thomas Titus KIA 17 Aug 2004.  I was his team leader.  So this is a must have for me, more emotional wise than anything.  Mr. Tom Titus whom I have a close relationship with like a second father is a higly decorated Vietnam Vet himself that barely made it out himself.  Their great uncle was Calvin P. Titus, Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient from the Boxer Rebellion (China Relief).  Plus their is another unconfirmed Titus with the CMOH from the Civil War yet to be determined of realtionship connection because of records issues.  The most wierd part of the whole situation, Mr. Titus was with the Rangers in 1st Cav during Vietnam, Calvin P. Titus was in the 14th Infantry during the Boxer Rebellion.  Brandon & I were in the US Army's 2-14th Infantry (His great uncles citation hung at Battalion HQ's), and we fell under the 1st CAV Division in Iraq...
You can also see in the background when interviewing Mr. Titus, US Army Ranger (Airborne) Retired, a TIME mag photo of our fire team with Brandon & I plus, 2 other soldiers,  Only 2 of us in that photo are alive today (and we also have Purple Hearts from being Wounded in Action).",1352160000,6,1353,4.504098360655738
4436173,4,B004NJC0LG,"This documentary is a sober, authentic look at those who served in Vietnam and in recent years have endured the angst of having a son or daughter serve in the Iraq War.  In some of the vignettes shown,  veterans express their grief at the death of their son or daughter while serving in Iraq.  While the director also includes some happy reunions, the worry, uncertainty and relief while the loved one is overseas is enlightening.

The documentary also portrays the opposition of some parents and Iraq War veterans against the war effort.  Regardless of your political or moral views about war, as a veteran myself, I know that the experience of war by those in the military who find themselves in actual combat is NEVER pleasant, and I think that the documentary presents a balanced, but moving view of the impact of war on veterans, their family, and on the society at large.  It is a fact that some who serve in combat are so adversely impacted by the experience of war that they oppose warfare and openly show their opposition to it.  While I do not share their views, I understand how they could oppose war.

I especially recommend this documentary for those who have not been impacted personally by war so that they can gain a perspective on a socio-political phenomenon that is likely to occur as long as humankind exists.",1306713600,2,1329,4.67381974248927
4436174,5,B004NJC0LG,"Came across the docmentary by accident & ended up watching it twice in one night on PBS. The generational links, comments were so real. I would recomend this to everyone, no matter how you feel personally about ""war."" This is a human story and should be viewed in classrooms everywhere.",1306713600,3,286,4.74
8436738,5,B004NJC0LG,Great movie. My dad is a Vietnam vet and im an Iraq vet. Definitely worth watching.,1520553600,,83,4.25
8436739,4,B004NJC0LG,"Good movie. Having served 3.5 years in Iraq myself, I can relate to a lot of what these guys were talking about. It's hard at times though. Especially when you come home and people always ask you those terrible questions, did you kill anyone. In my case, I was an interrogator, so people would always ask if we tortured anyone, or waterboarded anyone and then look at us like some kind of monster for just doing our jobs. It's been nearly 11 years since my first deployment to Iraq and there are just some things you can't unsee or things you can't unhear or undo. You wish you could, but you can't.

I think the only that gets me more mad is when vets or activist like to say ""Not my war"" or ""it's someone else's war"". It's not. Its your war. You signed the papers to join, not pick and choose which wars we fight in. We may not agree politically with how a war is fought or who started, but if you signed up, you have no right to complain about having to honor your duty. The guys who got drafted are a whole different story, they didn't have a choice, but those of us who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, we volunteered.",1508371200,,1122,4.21860465116279
8436740,4,B004NJC0LG,I have never taken their sacrifices for granted and have always shown my gratitude throughout the years.  I watched this film through tears.  It just kills me to know what our troops and vets have gone through and are currently going through.,1504396800,,242,4.738095238095238
8436741,5,B004NJC0LG,Great documentary about what it's like in combat and then to have to sit and watch your children experience the same things. The Dead are the only ones that see peace without war!!!,1500336000,,181,4.515151515151516
8436742,4,B004NJC0LG,"I enjoyed this because I could related to it. My dad is a Vietnam Veteran and I am an Iraq Veteran. And interestingly I noticed our relationship changed in certain ways after I went to Iraq in 2004. He came down to see me before I left Fort Bliss. And he opened up to me more about his experience more during Vietnam after I got back. There are certain experiences people shared in war regardless of the time, conflict or generation. And it was interesting to see this captured in a documentary. So seeing other families sharing these similar experiences in a documentary was special. The documentary itself wasn't exactly cutting edge, eye opening, controversial or anything, but I think it was solid and well done. Anyone with an interest in the war and it's affect on family will find it an interesting topic.",1499904000,,812,4.645833333333333
8436743,5,B004NJC0LG,"I never considered enlisting in the Armed Forces, even though my parents served in the Air Force during the Korean War. I suppose I could have, but by the time I turned 18, the Vietnam War had been over for three years. But that really wasn't the issue. During the most intense part of the Vietnam War (1966-1968), my family and I were transferred to Clark Air Force in the Philippines. I was eight years old, my sister was seven, and our brother was two. Our mother used to take us out to the flight line to pick Dad up after he came back from a mission. He was a load master on the C-131s. He brought supplies and people in (food, ammo, guns, jeeps, troops), and the wounded and dead back to Clark. I saw the crews tossing out the body bags from the loading decks of the C-131s. It took me a while to figure out what those crews were doing. Death was an abstract concept to me when I was eight years old. I asked my mother about what the crews were doing, and as usual, she ignored my question. The wounded weren't a mystery to me. I could see them laying on the cots in the Medi-vac buses, all bandaged up and never moving. Later on in life, I learned that the men were probably given morphine through their I.V.s.

I'm not saying anything different from other commentators, and that is, war is hell. I saw a different side of war as a ""base brat"", and I know that a number of my parents' friends died in Vietnam. I attended several funerals. But what I experienced was nothing compared to what the men and women who served this country have been through. I'very known a number of them, and even though they don't consider themselves heroes, that's what they are to me. This documentary makes that point clear. I gave this film five stars because I thought it presented an accurate perspective of the emotional conflicts that come up when a family member enlists in the military during war times.",1499040000,,1899,4.364406779661017

8436745,5,B004NJC0LG,"Fathers who fought in the Vietnam War with sons/daughters in the Iraq war who all agree that Gen. Patton was correct:  War is Hell.  No matter where or when or for how long, the terrible experiences in battle haunt  those who come home throughout the rest of their lives.  For those parents who fought a past war and must suffer the terrible anxiety of having a child in this war is heartrending.",1483574400,2,396,4.458333333333333
