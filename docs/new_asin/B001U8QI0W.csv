8630155,1,B001U8QI0W,"I am going to Southern Africa and wanted a video about things i would see there.  This is NOT that video.  It says one line about  some major attractions then covers places people will never visit in detail.  A lot of time is spent on spending the night in a tribal village, eating termites and participating in native dances. Also, instead of talking about Soweto, the video spends time covering the reunion of the guide and her nanny. I have seen beautiful pictures of Cape Town but the video of Cape Town is all gray and brown. There is too much of ""Visitors go to see this but I prefer that."" Visitors are the ones who will buy your video.  Shouldn't you show them what they will see?  This is not a travel video. If you want a travel video look elsewhere.",1436227200,,760,4.316901408450704
