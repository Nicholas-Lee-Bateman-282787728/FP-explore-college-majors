4577863,5,B0055HK6YS,"This movie is great for all ages.  It helps the parents see the mistakes they're making by putting their jobs first, before their children.  The movie is also light-hearted enough to appeal to all ages!!",1322438400,7,203,4.771428571428571
4577864,3,B0055HK6YS,"Another Hallmark Christmas movie with plenty of the right elements but somewhat uninspired.

Santa crashes and loses his memory.  He takes up residence at a disjointed, not really in the spirit of Christmas, family led by the ever watchable Jennifer Beals.  His chief elf(not from 'Elf'), nicely played by Jordan Prentice, works with the family to try to help Santa get it together in time for you know what.

The family is too tied up in their work and own affairs to appreciate the meaning of the season and each other.  Finding their way to togetherness in mildly amusing  ways is the predictable nature of this made for TV flick.

Our kids liked the reindeer but were quick to say, ""That's not how Santa really is.""  Perhaps his slight accent, lack of more jolliness(of course, he did lose his memory) and lack of more rotundness dampened their review.

It's clean and well meaning but not super funny or novel.  I'd say enjoy it for what it is.  Merry Christmas!",1322265600,8,967,4.662721893491124
4577865,5,B0055HK6YS,I really like Christmas and I really like this movie. I have seen seen at least one other movie where Santa Claus loses his memory and I think this was done better. The family doesnt come together until literaly brought together because they're to busy. The son seems to be the only one who cares about Christmas for a while until it becomes clear that the parents busy schudles are affecting his older sister too. The bag of presents is accidently sent away to a charity drive. And the daughter doesnt believe the guy is Santa Claus until his head elf tells her what she wanted for Christmas when she was seven. A brother. This is an excellent Christmas movie. Five stars and merry Christmas.,1322179200,,693,4.552

4577873,5,B0055HK6YS,"A gem of a Christmas movie, this one stars Jennifer Beals as a happily married Mom with two kids and a husband who's as much a workaholic as her.  Now, Santa has just fallen off their roof and doesn't remember who he is.

The premise is cute, the movie is sweet and very nice for kids of all ages.  One reviewer pointed out that the plot doesn't always make sense -- which is true enough.  But for this kind of movie, that doesn't bother me too much.  Maybe when I've watched it for several years running it will wear thin.  But it is nice, funny in spots, touching and uplifting -- the kind of movie where you feel yourself hoping they'll fix their few problems and get along even better.

And, unlike so many ""Christmas"" movies, it really has something to do with Christmas.  Good cast, nice enough story and enjoyable for kids of all ages.",1471219200,,842,4.352564102564102

4577906,4,B0055HK6YS,"I like any movie with Jennifer Beals performing in them.  She played more like an older sister in this movie.  This movie was interesting, because it had a planned message within it from the start of Santa Claus falling off the rooftop of the families home.  The little boy was also the give-a-way point of this movie, which matter-of-fact all Christmas movies have a message of caring, loving, family and giving, as well as, being with family who are more important than anything in life.",1385683200,,489,4.729411764705882
4577907,4,B0055HK6YS,Another one of those family movies that shows mom and dad working too much and not paying much attention to their children.  Santa helps bring it all back to the right focus.  A keeper for me.,1384732800,,192,4.305555555555555

The parents spend all their time working and not paying attention to their kids, Hannah and Toby.  Santa comes a day early to deliver presents and falls off the the Fox's roof and looses his memory.  The Fox family tries to restore Santa's memory.

I think this movie was a waste of money.  I wish I did not buy it. It was a waste of time watching it was also boring.  DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE. The only thing I liked in the movie was the dog in the end was cute but the dog was only in it for like 5 minutes.  This movie is not like the other great Hallmark Channel/ABC Family movies out there.",1356998400,,715,4.064285714285714

I love the way it shows how the family was  not functioning as a unit & how the family becomes a loving & caring famiily unit.  Sure wish society would take notice & put these principles into practice-all year, not just the holidays.  Thank you.

4577919,3,B0055HK6YS,"When I first read what this movie was about, I thought the story sounded pretty clever.  Now, I realize that this is a holiday movie and anything goes in the land of make believe; however, I just feel that there were too many details within the story that just didn't add up or were just left out out of incompetence and sloppiness.

First of all, the story takes place two days before Christmas in a cold climate setting but you wouldn't know it by some of the outdoor scenes, it looked more like the fall season as I couldn't help noticing that all the trees still had most of their leaves, some were green and some had already changed to the fall colors, there were leaves everywhere on the ground (they could have at least raked the leaves before they shot the outdoor scenes) and you could clearly see that more leaves were falling from the trees while the movie was going on. I feel that this was an important detail that they clearly missed and a distraction to the story. The other issue that I have with this story, is that the couple let's a total stranger in a  Santa Claus suit that crashed into their house sleep on their couch and they let their kids interact and go out with this character because they're too busy with their jobs although they don't believe that he's really Santa. Is that really a good idea? Wow, now that's what I call a responsible parent!

There were some funny parts and also the actor that played the elf (I can't think of his name, sorry) was very good. Additionally, I think if this story was modified and had a different direction, this movie could have turned out much better.",1345852800,8,1619,4.422818791946309
4577920,5,B0055HK6YS,"This is a great family story about a family that all had their own agenda's but with the aid of the youngest, the family is brought together to rescue Christmas and find the happiniess as a family, that was missing.  Heart warming performances and a well acted movie of the kind that need to be found more often.  I added this to my movie library, and enjoy it.
