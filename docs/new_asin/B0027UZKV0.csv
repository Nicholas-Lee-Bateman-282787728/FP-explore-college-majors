8355138,5,B0027UZKV0,"My previous experiences with dog training classes have been a disappointment to say the least.  My little corgi spent more time hiding from the other, bigger dogs than learning anything. What a waste! I've spent several hundred dollars and more that 6 months of my time on dog training classes only to end up with a dog that certainly is no better behaved than before. Even worse, she ended up with a serious fear of other dogs that she never had before.

Since a dog training DVD seemed like a good alternative to dog training classes, I bought Trained Solid. This dog training DVD is every bit clear and easy to follow as promised and my early results are encouraging. Even better, because it's a DVD, I can train my dog-shy corgi at home and I can review the instructions any time I am not sure I'm doing it right. Boy do I wish I'd tried this before I wasted my money and time on those ""dog training classes"".
