4083059,5,B00383XZP8,Great to be able to have the later Monogram Studios Chan films on good quality DVD.  WB did a fine job on this collection.  I am ready to order more as soon as they issue another set of these Charlie Chan films.,1276300800,8,211,4.0
4083060,3,B00383XZP8,"All the reviewers are gushing about this set and as a Chan fan I can somewhat agree. I find this small 4 movie issue an extreme disappointment. Many years back Warner Bros issued the first six Chan Monograms. When I read the news release I assumed the rest of the Monogram Chans were being released. I was shocked when I found out it was only four films. In this day and age when complete TV series are being issued in a set, why only four films. Also disappointing is Warner Bros. skipping over two Sidney Toler entries. Messing up the chronological order of the films that have been released. I suppose in another ten years Warner Bros. will issue another set. But honestly, Chan fans have waited long enough. Fox has issued their Chan sets in fairly fast sequence. Come on Warner Bros., get on the ball.",1275955200,21,806,4.489795918367347
4083061,4,B00383XZP8,"As other viewers have commented. I will order this simply because there is no other medium available for Chan projects.  I would have preferred that they follow the previous line of 20th Century Fox releases, for they were fully restored with a good transfer of sight and sound.  I have a few that I taped from American Movie Classics and they are not very good copies so I can always hope for better.  I do agree that nothing was said concerning restoration and close captioning; and also the listed length of 199 minutes does not jibe with the actual total time of 257 minutes (check individual times on IMDB).  TCM should know better than to release chopped copies!  I hope I am wrong about this but I will enjoy them as a long time Chan fan until something better is released.  A little Chan is better than no Chan at all.",1275436800,9,826,4.437086092715232
4083062,5,B00383XZP8,"Before I begin, I should state that this is a pre-release review - which,at the time of typing, I suspect also applies to all the other reviews currently attributed to this release on here. With this in mind, I can't pass comment on the quality of the print transfer or whether or not there is Closed Captioning. However, with regards to the films themselves, I've seen two of the titles released in this collection, these being Dark Alibi and The Trap. The latter movie is simply woeful and not even a decent entry in the Monogram series from which all the movies on here derive - this was Toler's swansong playing Chan and, at the time, he was gravely ill with little time remaining - naturally this has an adverse effect on his performance.  Dark Alibi, is, however, an entertaining yarn and ranks right up there with any title released on the other Monogram DVD collection i.e 'The Chanthology'. I've only ever seen one Roland Winters Chan movie and that was 'The Goldeneye' (not on this set) - it'll be interesting to reacquaint myself with his portrayal of the character by watching his first performance in 'The Chinese Ring' which is the last title included within this release. Its interesting to note that, with this set, there are still 7 Chan movies still awaiting release on DVD - 5 Roland Winters titles and 2 Sidney Toler - will these ever see the light of day, well, we can only hope....5 star rating given simply because I love these films, even the bad ones (and The Trap is pretty bad) - I'll update once I'm in actual receipt of the product and will then pass comment on print quality and the like.

UPDATE: - I'm now in receipt of this set - print wise, the quality of the films is pretty good, 'The Chinese Ring' is the best (although there are a few brief scenes where remastering has been noticeably neglected). On the flip side, 'The Trap' displays signs of actual print damage. I have a question regarding 'The Trap' that I'd really liked answered - 37 seconds into this film, just as the titles are rolling in front of a backdrop of a beach, something jumps out from the bottom right of the screen for literally a split second. I've paused my DVD and played in slow motion but to no avail! The more I look at this the more alien like it seems! Would someone please confirm what on earth this is - I'm guessing this is a blooper as there seems to be little logic behind its appearance! That aside, each of these movies are just over an hour in length - sadly, these films are light years behind the Twentieth Century Fox films and therefore I'd recommend these titles to die hard Chan fans only. If you're new to the series therefore, please do not judge the series on the offerings of this set. Roland Winters provides a different slant on the character, but frankly, to me, he lacks any believability in the role - his interpretation of Chan is more akin to Peter Sellers' portrayal of Inspector Clouseau - considering Chan is not a comedic character, this is not a compliment. There are no extras whatsoever and with 4 discs in a fold out cardboard case, one would be forgiven for thinking this is rather an expensive set for what you get. However, I still want to see the last 7 titles on an official DVD release and prey that these are released in one set as opposed to the likely two. Maybe the next set could have 4 discs with two films on 3 discs and 1 disc with just the one movie AND some extras. I still rate this 5 stars as I consider the print quality to be better than expected and the presentation case is fairly good too.",1269820800,86,3563,4.429878048780488

* THE LOST WARNER OLAND FILMS:
Apparently all prints and negatives of four films were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1937.
Through some fancy footwork, Warner Video has been able to bring three of them back to life:

--- ""Charlie Chan Carries On"" (1931)
Simultaneously with this lost film, a Spanish-language version was filmed using the same sets and costumes:
""Eran trece"" (""There Were Thirteen"") starring MANUEL ARBO (photo 3) as Charlie Chan.
It's in VOLUME 1 with English subtitles (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"")

--- ""Charlie Chan's Chance"" (1932) and ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (1934)
Warner Video cleverly reproduced these lost films using voice actors, the original screenplay, still photos and music. Sort of like a one hour radio show with illustrations:
""Charlie Chan's Chance"" is in VOLUME 3 (coupled with ""The Black Camel"")
""Charlie Chan's Courage"" is in VOLUME 4 (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"")
Too bad they didn't do the same with ""Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"" (1933)

CHARLIE CHAN'S ASSISTANTS
Beginning with the eighth film (""Charlie Chan in Paris""), the series introduced various family members to assist their father in crime-solving.
Over the next fifteen years, four sons and two daughters fulfilled this role, all played by Chinese-American actors:
1) Lee = ten films (Keye Luke)
2) Jimmy = thirteen films (Sen Yung - later billed as Victor Sen Yung)
3) Tommy = eleven films (Benson Fong or Sen Yung)
4) Eddie = one film (Edwin Luke)
5) Iris = one film (Marianne Quon )
6) Frances = one film (Frances Chan - her actual name)

For a breakdown of the films that each family member was in (also details about Birmingham Brown)

4083085,4,B00383XZP8,"Charlie Chan fans will enjoy this quartet of Monogram-era films. It is unfair to compare these with the Fox Chans which all had a bigger budget. Sidney Toler is featured in three of the movies and does a good job in each. His performance in ""The Trap"" is often seen as being impaired  because of his personal illness at the time. This is highly exaggerated. He does just fine. ""The Trap"" is really a pretty lively movie which almost has a kind of a ""Burke's Law"" feel to it with all the showgirls involved. It also features Kirk Alyn , the  Superman of the movie serials. ""The Chinese Ring"" is a remake of ""Mr. Wong In Chinatown"" (1939).  Victor Sen Yung's  character, called 'Jimmy' in two of the Toler films  is ,oddly, called 'Tommy' in this one.

Mustn't forget Birmingham Brown and Chattanooga. Brown. Both add that ""just right"" comedic element. If you like low-key murder mysteries with a touch of laughter, you will love these.

Dark Alibi, Dangerous Money and The Trap all star Sydney Toler in some of the last Chan movies he made before his death. They could have made this a better collection if they had gotten rid of the Roland Winters movie ""The Chinese Ring"" and included the missing Toler film ""Shadows over Chinatown"" to complete the set.

I don't care for Roland Winters as Chan but Victor Sen Young and Mantan Moreland provide some continuity of characters in Winters' first film as Chan. The Chinese Ring is a close remake of a Mr. Wong film with near identical plot lines.

If you want to collect all of the Sydney Toler Chans then this collection is helpful but not completely satisfying. Plus, packaging is one DVD holder where you have to stack the 4 DVDs on top of each other in the case. Not a particularly good way to keep DVDs in good condition.",1458259200,7,908,4.431137724550898

The first two episodes, ""Dark Alibi"" and ""Dangerous Money"" are typical Charlie Chan mysteries albeit as low budget productions.  The second two are a different story.  In the third picture ""The Trap"" Sidney Toler was already very ill with intestinal cancer and you can tell as he struggles with his lines in his weakened condition.  The final picture with Roland Winters as Charlie Chan was not worthy of the Warner Oland and Sidney Toler films that had preceded it.  Roland makes a terrible Charlie Chan and with Monogram's low budgets, poor quality quickly follows.",1434931200,,717,5.033898305084746

4083192,5,B00383XZP8,"Had not known these were available, and even though made a the C or D studio, Monogram, the first four offerings are better than the first 6 Toler made after leaving 20th Century Fox Movies beginning with Charlie Chan in the Secret Service, the next four present one with Benson Fong (he was in approximately 5 Perry Mason episodes with Ray Burr), these are actually better productions than those first 6.  Victor Sen Yeung has adultified, Mantan Moreland has calmed down and these final three (one still not made and may be lost-The Red Dragon) are are far more fun to watch.  Much of this change has to do with the quality of the scripts and acting, and maybe our knowledge that Sidner Toler will soon be dead--""He's just bound to die, he's just bound to.""  The fourth disk and final set just released were made with Roland Winters, who shows very accurately that Charlie Chan cannot run forever.  The only thing I deeply regret about any of the Chan movies is that when I watch CC in Monte Carlo, that there will never another made with Warner Oland.  When he waved goodby goodbye to Jules Etienne Joubert aka Harold Huber, he was waving goodbye to the world, to 20th Centuro Fox Studios and to the millions of fans around the world.  So with the exception of I believe f CC's made before and one after The Black Camel, and The Red Dragon, not yet on DVD with Roland Winters, we now have as complete set of probably the best made and largest cash cow ""B"" movie set ever made. And thank you, 20th Century Fox and John Cork for working so hard to getting all these together and TCM/MGM for the beautiful restoration.  And a special thanks TCM for to colorizing these and may it never happen again.",1423785600,3,1698,4.475728155339806

I felt is was the least convincing, and certainly the story was second rate at best. It did not feel like a Charlie Chan movie at all. The other movies are fantastic though. There are four movies in this set, three are great, one not so much. If you want to get a taste of Charlie Chan in three versions from three actors, this is the set for you.

Charlie Chan went through several actors during the years.  Sydney Toler's last Chan film, The Trap, is in this set as well as Roland Winters' first Chan film, The Chinese Ring.  Everyone has their favorite actor and I really enjoyed Toler's version.

Dark Alibi was fun -- as in all the films of this set -- with number two son Tommy and the cowardly chauffeur, Burmingham Brown.  A man is falsely accused of a murder and Chan is in a race to find evidence of tampering and forging fingerprints before the man is executed.  Surprise mastermind in this one.  I did enjoy the banter between Birmingham and Tommy, especially the prison scenes where Birmingham's pal in prison chats without finishing a sentence.  ""Did you know?""  ""Yes, I knew her, she --""  ""No, really?""

Dangerous Money -- sailing on the high seas, docking in the South Pacific (with all-white dancers?) and a plot of murder and forgery carries through.  Not so much Tommy and Birmingham banter in this one.  Some may find the 1940's treatment of race offputting but remember, this was common in the Amos and Andy Age.

Chinese Ring -- takes place in my home town of San Francisco with Roland Winters' first Chan appearance.  The Birmingham banter goes on a bit too long -- I would not mind just cutting out the comedy all together, seemed to slow the story down some.  As in all Chan films, the Chan-isms are hilarious.  Philip Ahn as Captain Kong who also was in many films and TV, notably in the Kung  Fu TV series.

4083261,3,B00383XZP8,"It has been my self imposed rule to not review an item I have not finished. This collection will be my first exception. These movies do not hold up well.

I have watched all of Dark Alibi and Dangerous Money. I survived The Trap by using it as background entertainment. I may not keep the collection long enough to watch The Chinese Ring.
To be honest, I do not remember any of the plots.

Because some read reviews for information on the technical quality of the presentation: These disks played well on my DVD player. Video was relatively clean and I noted no major problems in the audio. For 60 odd year old black and white, these may be better than average transfers. TCM handled them well.

The biggest problem may just be timing. These movies were made in the middle 40's, things moved slower. In fact the car chase in The Trap, allegedly at 75 MPH was over a narrow poorly surfaced road and was comic, if not intentionally.

Sidney Toller, not the definitive Charlie Chan, comes across as tired and old. Given that this role truly drove him to drink - being half potted helped him and his predecessor to speak in the prescribed pigeon- he may have been more than just tired.

Mantan Moreland, the black vaudeville comedian made his name in these movies. Mostly there are too many minutes of him being goggle-eyed and afraid wandering about in some dark cluttered place while the wah wah wah music tells you that this is comedic relief. In Dangerous Money he does get to perform a few sets of his trade mark ""indefinite talk"" where he and another performer speaking very fast complete each others sentences.

Victor Sen Young as Number 2 son Jimmy is sufficiently bumbling and over eager.

Ultimately this set is for those of you looking to complete Charlie Chan collections. As for me I am going to dig out some Warner Oland Charlie Chan and see if those movies hold up better.",1353542400,,1884,4.556213017751479

4083263,3,B00383XZP8,"After Fox's excellent boxed sets of their Warner Oland and Sidney Toler films and MGM/UA's six-film Charlie Chan - Chanthology [DVD], TCM's set of four later Monogram Chan films is a slightly curious compilation, including three Sidney Toler films and Roland Winters' debut in the role, but skipping over two more Toler films, The Red Dragon and Shadows Over Chinatown, which - like Winters last five films in the series - remain unreleased on home video, making a chronological boxed set (or even a single boxed set for the seven remaining films) highly unlikely. The films themselves are typical of the latter days at Monogram, more product to be churned out fast and cheap than inspired, though it does get off to a good start...

""Being a detective is an ugly trade.""
""Ugliest trade sometimes have moment of joy. Even gravedigger know some for whom he would do his work with extreme pleasure.""

Dark Alibi seems like everyone at Monogram made a conscious decision to try to get the Charlie Chan series back on track rather than just churning them out. After his largely anonymous and confused earlier Chan film The Shanghai Cobra, director Phil Karlson suddenly raises his game with some excellent visuals, aided by decent production values and a much more memorable array of suspects and dodgy characters than the usual undistinguished bunch that was the usual stock in trade at the studio. The plot's not bad either, with Charlie having only nine days to prove an ex-con who has gone straight for years is not guilty of a murder and bank robbery. The trail takes him to a boarding house whose prim and puritanical landlady takes in ex-offenders to reform and to state prison where either the warden or a trustee may be putting the fingerprint records to ill use and Mantan Moreland runs into his old nightclub partner Ben Carter again for more of their trademark patter, with Charlie even getting in on the act. The return of Moreland is particularly welcome after Willie Best's awkward turn standing in for him in The Red Dragon, and there's a real easygoing warmth between him and Benson Fong's Tommy Chan and even Sidney Toler's ever-critical Charlie (""Son Tommy is noisy woodpecker in family tree"") that was much missed in the previous entry. It's not all good - there's a tiresomely drawn out bit of comedy with Moreland in a theatrical warehouse and the mastermind's motivation is thrown in as a bit of clumsy last-minute out-of-nowhere exposition - but it's one Monogram Chan that zips along enjoyably without overstaying its welcome.

""This cruise has been a nightmare!""
""But not dull one, Captain!""

Shame on you for fibbing, Charlie! At 66 minutes, Dangerous Money is one of the longest Monogram Chans, but it's not the extra three or four minutes that makes it seem so slow but Terry Morse's lethargic direction and Sidney Toler's bored performance. It's professional enough on a purely technical level, but there's just no spark there despite decent production values and a pool of shipboard suspects who almost all zealously vouch for each other after a secret service agent investigating some hot money in Samoa is murdered en route. Miriam Kissinger's script does manage to give a few of its supporting cast some distinguishing characteristics but really struggles with the aphorisms (""Hasty man could also drink tea with fork"") and falls prey to a particularly silly final revelation that makes you wonder just what a couple of the villains got up to in the cabin they shared on their long ocean crossing.

With the exception of a couple of minutes when he's dancing with Amira Moustafa, Toler seems particularly disinterested, hitting his marks, saying his lines with the lack of enthusiasm most of them deserve and waiting to walk off, not bothering to hide his boredom when he finally, slowly does so. And a lot of the film happens slowly - not very slowly, but slowly enough for pauses to feel more like padding to spin it out to a contractually obligated running time than dramatic devices. It works slightly in the film's favor in the scenes with Victor Sen Yung and Willie Best, who aren't as brashly juvenile as in their previous pairing, but you can't help wondering if they're being directed to tone it down or they're just not that interested in their lazy and dragged out antics either. It doesn't help that the script at times leaves their tiresome attempts to work their way into Charlie's investigation disjointed and half-hearted: one would-be comic setpiece with Best faking illness falls completely flat because it's only at the very end of the scene that we discover just why he's doing it, or even that he IS faking it, which turns what should be a punchline into mere exposition. And we never find out just what the significance of the tortoise with a torch on its back is...

""Mr. Chan doesn't want dramatics.""
""Excuse, please. On contrary, dramatics highly valuable now.""

The Trap was not just Toler's final Chan film but also the last he ever made, but he manages to do a decent job of hiding just how seriously ill he was while making it. Would that he had a better film to go out on. Infamous as the one where someone walks in front of the camera in the title sequence and the ever penny-pinching Monogram still used the take, the film itself is certainly better directed than its predecessor but suffers from another bad Miriam Kissinger screenplay that manages to be both obvious and ultimately a bit nonsensical. And, as was increasingly the case in the Monogram Chans, Charlie doesn't do a great deal of sleuthing, uncovering the odd hidden secret by the expedient of being sent telegrams from his sources to speed up the exposition. It actually takes him a good quarter of an hour to even turn up in this one, the film kicking off with a group of variety girls taking a Malibu beach house with their promoter and his seedy press agent and setting up the most conniving member of the troupe as the film's obvious corpse du jour. The biggest surprise is that when the body turns up garrotted, everybody but Charlie naturally assumes she committed suicide...

Some spectacularly contrived bad writing sends Charlie rushing to the scene after the silly fillies panic on the phone and somehow convince Birmingham Brown that Jimmy is dead, which might provoke a reaction from the audience (though not necessarily the one the filmmakers intended) but doesn't seem to bother them all that much. From then on it's the usual run of additional murder attempts, unmasking of suspects so obvious they can't be guilty and the inevitable trap to catch the killer, who turns out to be pretty obvious after all even if the motive is suddenly thrown in at their dying moments. Future movie serial Superman Kirk Alyn is along as an unflatteringly moustached Highway Patrolman, while for once Jimmy and Birmingham's scenes don't seem too dragged out and irrelevant, but Kissinger has a tin ear for dramatic confrontations, with scenes where the various suspects turn on each other and throw accusations as a result of Charlie's `Oriental tricks' proving just as painful as the misfired comic padding in most of the Monogram films. She's not much better at preventing her female ensemble from slipping into hysterical stereotyping and occasional verbal catfighting, and can't even come up with a single decent epigram for Charlie (""Best laid plans of mice and men sometimes, uh, go a little bit haywire, huh?""). At 68 minutes it does start to outstay its welcome long before the slowest car chase until Enigma even though Howard Bretherton's helming is steadier than Morse's on Dangerous Money, but somehow still remains strangely watchable in a late late night and too tired to turn it off kind of way.

""Murder in the house of Charlie Chan! Now I've seen everything.""

Most audiences had seen everything The Chinese Ring had to offer too, at least if they'd seen Monogram's Mr Wong in Chinatown [DVD] [1939] [Region 1] [US Import] [NTSC], produced as a direct rival to the Chan series only eight years earlier in the days when Charlie was still a fixture on the Fox lot. What they hadn't seen was the new Charlie Chan, with Roland Winters making his rather tepid debut in the role after Toler's death. Underwhelming is the world that immediately springs to mind, with Winters underplaying the part and going for naturalism that he only occasionally achieves but fatally lacking the screen presence he needs to carry the movie. The kind of actor who could do a very decent job of a supporting role that didn't require anything showy, he has his moments but is miscast in a role that needs either star power or more of a personality than he brings it. There clearly has been some rethinking of the part to meet the new actor halfway, with Chan no longer working for the US government or even living in Honolulu with his large family but living in San Francisco with only Number Three Son Jimmy - now renamed Tommy for some inexplicable reason despite still being played by Victor Sen Yung - and Birmingham Brown, both of whom are much more tightly reined in.

The production values are better in some scenes and William Beaudine's unambitious direction decent enough, but without a Boris Karloff or a Sidney Toler in the lead it lacks a compelling centre and it's a more sober affair than previous entries. To a degree you could almost see Winters as the Timothy Dalton of screen Chans, taking the character back to his literary roots and a darker tone, although even Dalton's Bond has a sense of humour that's lacking here. There's no sly mischief or enjoyment in his work here. Any attempt at a joke is met with a stern ""Humorous dialogue not very humorous"" (not that it's hard to disagree with him) while even a villain's offer of a 100 mile swim in international waters just elicits a flat ""Not very funny."" While dispensing with the comic relief is a welcome move, it does mean that Jimmy - sorry, Tommy - and Birmingham have next to nothing to do in the film, with Warren Douglas' and Louise Currie's bickering cop and reporter romantic double-act getting their screen time to no real effect instead. Scott Darling only does a fairly minor job of revising his screenplay for the earlier Mr. Wong film, losing Wong's morally ambiguous trip to Chinatown to elicit information from the Tongs but carrying over not just characters and plot developments but swathes of word-for-word dialogue as well, and at times it feels like Beaudine has carried over the same camera angles from Bill Nigh's film as well. Perhaps if Winters had had stronger material and the kind of values Fox gave their Sidney Toler Chan films he might have made a more comfortable impression in the role, but you're left feeling he's trying to give an interesting interpretation without much support in a not that interesting film.

The picture quality on WHV/TCM's DVD compilation is excellent, with each film on a separate disc, though there are no extras or chapter menus (though each film is chaptered).",1345507200,10,11013,4.821164021164021

4083265,5,B00383XZP8,"I don't care what anybody says, ""The Trap"" is awesome. It's not so much a Chan film as it is one of those wonky, old school sci-fi flicks, minus the sci-fi. Winters has a great Chan impersonation in ""The Chinese Ring"", but his long honky-ass nose kills my suspension of disbelief. ""Dark Alibi"" & Dangerous Money"" were fine for what they were. Not up to the level of ""Treasure Island"", ""Wax Museum"", ""...In Rio"" or ""Castle in the Desert"" but that is to be expected.

For those asking about the 2 missing films ""SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN"" & ""RED DRAGON"", I just purchased both of them from TheVinageTheatre. They are in good enough shape for the viewer to follow the story, but not good enough to be shown on TV or whatnot.

4083275,3,B00383XZP8,"These Chans are a product of Monogram studios which put out the cheapest possible product in the late forties. The sets are poorly done and the plots are often not too logical. The best plot, oddly enough, is the Roland Winters entry, mostly because it is a remake of Mr. Wong in Chinatown and a much better story to begin with. The other three films feature Sidney Toler and Victor Sen Young (#2 son). Unfortunately too much time is spent in these films following Mantan Morland around being scared in a spooky warehouse (cellar, etc.) which was overdone in the Monogram films. I will keep this set because I have all the Chans, but it is a shame that they could not have been better produced by a studio worthy of Chan.",1291334400,5,721,4.46969696969697
4083276,4,B00383XZP8,"I've read many of the comments made on different sets of these classics and I find that I must answer to some of the comments I see. First off for all the hi-tech geeks, these films are very old, ancient by todays' standards. Forget about the quality because even the best revitalization efforts are not going to compare to a new movie. The fact that these are classics actually makes it ok for the quality to not be grade ""A"". Look at the quality rather of the acting (yes they are flawed) but consider the fact that these were made around the early stages of film making one must just accept it and move on. I personally watched all the reruns that WGN did in the 70's of these movies along with the Sherlock Holmes, and even Flash Gordon series which I have collected. Even with the many flaws with acting and props and quality, it brings me back to my youth. The fact that even then I appreciated these classics was an awesome experience for me then and now. Stop worrying about the quality issues and start appreciating the fact that they are still around for other generations to see. Can you imagine if these no longer existed. What a loss that would be. My only complaint is that it has taken the studios far too long to just make a complete set of all the Chan movies and stop trying to gouge the people for wanting them. I have seen actual bootleg full collection of these moveis and it is a shame that the studios did not heed the warning that people want them all. They did it with the Sherlock Holmes and many others so whats the problem. I currently have all the sets out and am anxious to see the rest myself. You watch because here is the real deal. Once the last movies are out, they will release them all in one set. That my friends is the cost we must pay for demanding or better yet expecting the studios to fork out lots of money to restore their products before we intend on bying them. That is all for now folks.",1289001600,2,1935,4.275204359673024
4083277,4,B00383XZP8,"The Charlie Chan film series was one of the most popular and enduring in Hollywood history.  Over forty films were made between 1931 and 1949 with three different actors playing the role of the master Chinese detective: Warner Oland, Sidney Toler, and Roland Winters.  None of the actors playing Chan were of Asian descent, which has led to a great deal of controversy in recent years.  Many feel that the films promoted a negative stereotype of Asians and Asian Americans. While it's true that many of the characters were stereotypes, you have to remember the films were made 65 - 75 years ago in a less politically correct era.  And not all of the stereotypes were negative.  Chan, in fact, was always shown to be the smartest guy in the room, solving cases that baffled the police.  In fact the police were only too happy to have Chan on their case.  They were also solid entertainment with mysteries that the viewer could play along with and try to solve as the killer wouldn't be revealed until the film's final minutes.

The four films in this set are from the end of the series.  It contains Toler's last three films and Winters' first.  Toler was an interesting character.  Halfway through his run of 22 appearances as Chan, 20th Century Fox dropped the series.  Toler bought the rights and took it to Monogram, one of the low-budget `Poverty Row' studios.  Monogram could only offer about half the budgets that Fox could but they were always able to get the most out of what they had to work with.  Toler played a more cantankerous Chan, doling out as many insults as bits of Oriental wisdom.

In ""Dark Alibi"" Chan is racing against time to rescue Thomas Hurley who is sentenced to death for robbing a bank and killing a security guard.  Hurley claims to have never set foot in the bank.  Chan discovers that two other men who served prison time with Hurley have already been executed for the exact same crime.  Chan believes that the fingerprints were forgeries, and the victims were all set up by the real thief.  The Chan films always featured comic relief and here it's courtesy of Chan's son Tommy (Benson Fong) and valet/chauffer Birmingham Brown played by Mantan Moreland.  Moreland was one of the funniest African American actors of the 1930s and 1940s.  Yes he was stereotyped but he always got the funniest lines.  He has several scenes in the film with his brother Benjamin (Ben Carter) there they do their ""pidgin English' routine of finishing each other's sentences as if they can read minds.  It's hilarious.  ""Dark Alibi"" is an ok mystery but made better with the comedic talents of Moreland and Carter.

""Dangerous Money"" is the best film in this set.  Chan is on a ship traveling to Australia with #2 son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) and Valet Chattanooga Brown (Willie Best).  A U.S. treasury agent going to Samoa to investigate stolen currency is murdered when a knife is thrown into his back.  Chan has to figure out which of the guests and/or crewmembers are responsible.  As usual most of the guests present strong reasons for being suspects.  One passenger Rona Simmonds (Gloria Warren) and ship's purser George Brace (Joseph Allen) are hiding a secret for which she is being blackmailed.  Jimmy and Chattanooga converse with each other with walkie-talkies using the decidedly racist handles of ""Chop Suey 108"" and ""Pork Chop 711"".  Still, they lend their hand in trying to solve the crimes, which balloon into several more murders.  A solid mystery!

""The Trap"" moves the action to a Malibu beachfront home where several showgirls are enjoying a vacation along with the show's owner, press agent, and the girl's ""house mother"".  One of the girls is found strangled by a silk rope and the show's star, Marcia, disappears.  Since the rest of the girls all hate the egotistical Marcia, they assume she is the killer.  However Marcia soon washes up on the beach similarly strangled.  Chan has to figure out which of the many people in the cast had the motive and means to commit the murders.  This was Toller's last Chan film.  He was suffering from cancer and his onscreen time was shortened drastically.  In once scene where he and several others race upstairs to investigate a scream, you can seem him labor to get up the stairs.  In this regard it's sad to watch.  Most of the other women grate on your nerves through the entire film particularly Rita Quigley as Clementine who spends the entire film shrieking at every little thing.  Thankfully Mantan Moreland Victor Sen Yung help out with their comic antics.  One another note of interest, Kirk Alyn, the first actor to play Superman in film, has a co-starring role as a Police Sergeant.

""The Chinese Ring"" (1947).  As mentioned this was Roland Winters' first outing as Chan.  The first thing you notice is the difference in age between he and Toler.  Winters was just 43 when he made this film while Toler was in his 70s while playing the role.  Secondly, while none of the men who played Chan were Asian, with Winters there barely seems to have been an effort made to make him look or sound Chinese.  A young Chinese woman shows up at Chan's house seeking his help, but before he can talk to her, she is murdered by a poison dart.  It turns out that she was a Princess looking to buy airplanes for her brother and was being swindled by her American partners.  Winters is completely lacking in personality and gives a pathetic effort, almost as if the role were beneath him.  At the very least, Toler always gave his all.  Not even the usually reliable Mantan Moreland could help The Chinese Ring as he was limited to running around scared through most of the film.  This one drags the grade of the whole set down a bit.",1286841600,9,5703,4.676381909547739
4083278,5,B00383XZP8,"Although the stories in this series are not as good as the previous boxed releases, they are certainly worth your time and money as they are Charlie Chan moves, unique and entertaining.

4083279,3,B00383XZP8,"I have been trying for years to figure out who owns what as far as the CHARLIE CHAN films are concerned. Several of the Fox CHAN films showed up on TV under a Warner Bros./7 Arts package. I've also heard that Leo Gutman, Inc. owned the rights to the later Monogram films. Somehow, THE BLACK CAMEL was leased or bought by Warner Bros. for years. (Maybe for a possible remake?)Fortunately, nowadays things seem fairly clear. Fox has now retained the rights of all of the CHARLIE CHAN films they originally produced. MGM/UA apparently owns the first 6 CHAN Monogram films, and from purchasing the Allied Artists film library, Warner Bros. owns the remainder of the CHAN Monograms from 1946 to the end of the series. I just wanted to clear that up as several posters here seem to be confused as to which studio owns what.

It seems to some that Warner Home Video and TCM has ""scraped the bottom of the barrel"" in putting these four Monogram CHARLIE CHAN films out on DVD. In a way, they have, but they've done their best to restore these films, which I've heard have been in sad shape for years. Even as a youngster, several of the Monogram CHARLIE CHAN films looked choppy, dupey and grimy from the TV prints I saw in Chicago, and a number of them were from foreign ""Pathe' Pictures, Ltd."" prints. So, we gotta give Warners and TCM kudos for getting the films in as good a shape as possible for DVD.

For my money, DARK ALIBI is probably the best of the post-1945 CHARLIE CHAN films. DANGEROUS MONEY and THE TRAP are the worst of the Sidney Toler films. Author Ken Hanke (CHARLIE CHAN AT THE MOVIES) likes the Roland Winters version of ""Charlie Chan"" far more than I do, so I'm sure he's happy that a good copy of THE CHINESE RING is avialable on DVD at last. I do agree with Mr. Hanke that the Monogram CHARLIE CHAN movies should be judged by what Monogram Pictures was capable of putting out at the time, given the budgets and shooting times the cast and crew had to work with. Compared with the average low-budget mystery film from Monogram and other studios of their ilk, the CHARLIE CHAN series is better than average in comparison. Nowhere near as good as the productions done earlier at 20th Century-Fox, but Ken Hanke argues that the Monograms can't and shouldn't be judged by the earlier CHAN productions made at Fox.

It's unfortunate that in today's economy, studios now seldom put out collections with the ""bells and whistles"" that collectors love: mini documentaries on the making of these films, biographies on the cast, etc., commentaries by historians, etc. If any set of CHARLIE CHAN films needs ""extras"" the Monogram series is it. These films have been maligned and unfairly judged over the years and it would be refreshing to hear CHARLIE CHAN experts like Ken Hanke, Howard Berlin, etc. or historians expert on Monogram (Ted Okuda for THE MONOGRAM CHECKLIST comes to mind, or Mike Price, who wrote an excellent biography on Mantan Moreland, MANTAN THE FUNNY MAN) to properly explain how these films were made, and why they still can be entertaining, more than 60 years later! Maybe things will be better when TCM/Warners puts out - I hope - additional sets and these ""extras"" can be included! Again, I'm hoping the sales will be good enough for TCM/Warner to put the rest of the Monogram CHARLIE CHAN films out on DVD.",1286496000,32,3335,4.620573355817875

4083293,3,B00383XZP8,"Last night I watched the first of the four Charlie Chan movies in the new set, DARK ALIBI. I gave it one star. The story is absurdly convoluted and unconvincing in its resolution. Sidney Toler was getting on in years and wasn't in very good health (only a couple of years away from his death), and lines that are fluffed were simply not reshot. Benson Fong was fine, though under- or misused in the role of Number 3 Son, Tommy Chan. And then there's the dreadful Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown, whose presence destroys every film he's in. However, he's paired off with someone named Ben Carter (playing a character called Carter, though he's supposedly Birmingham's brother), and they do a brilliant set of vaudeville turns where each one interrupts the other. This appeared first in an earlier Chan film, THE SCARLET CLUE. Here it was milked for all it was worth...which turned out to be the highlight of the film.

Somewhat less convoluted, DANGEROUS MONEY concerns smuggling and extortion on a passenger ship bound for Samoa. Charlie Chan and Number Two Son, Jimmy Chan (Victor Sen Yung) are on hand, as is Chattanooga Brown (Willie Best), another of those stammering, wide-eyed black characters, though hardly so obnoxious as Mantan Moreland but still afraid of his own shadow. Just who the guilty party is is up for grabs until the final three minutes. As for why he (dressed in drag) is killing is a bit muddled. Not one of the best, certainly, but superior to the previous film.

THE TRAP is the last Charlie Chan film to star Sidney Toler, who was in the process of dying of cancer and barely made it through his final films. He died six months after the completion of this turkey. It's painful to watch him in these last films. One might wonder why he kept making them, when he was so obviously in pain. But he owned the series, having bought the screen rights to the franchise when 20th Century Fox decided to drop the series after Toler's first 11 Chan films. Perhaps he was obligated? (An article I read online says that he bought the rights to the stories from the author, but that Fox sold the screen rights to Monogram. Whatever.) Maybe he was just one of those workhorses who refuse to be put out to pasture. At any rate, it's sad to watch him.

THE CHINESE RING is the first of the Chan movies to star Roland Winters as Chan...and a less convincing Asian would be awfully hard to come by. Okay, Warner Oland was from Sweden and Sidney Toler was from Missouri...but they come across as real Asians compared to Roland Winters. I mean, look at him! Aside from the eyebrows and the little beard under the lip, there's nothing remotely oriental about that face...or the accent or the physicality of the performance. Pathetic! Also pathetic is his final summation, which ought to be inscribed on every feminist's marching banner: ""Woman not made for heavy thinking but should always decorate scene like blossom of plum.""

Anyway, that boxed set is now on the shelf, along with the other Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto and Mr. Wong films...and there it will stay! I do hope, however, that someone will put out a set of the remaining Toler films, THE RED DRAGON and SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN.",1279065600,3,3198,4.654867256637168

4083297,2,B00383XZP8,"Loosely based on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved an audience favorite--but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took the role to ""poverty row"" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.  Even with Toler's death the character remained sufficiently popular for it to pass to yet another actor, in this case Roland Winters, who played Chan in several more films in the 1940s.

But there is a significant difference between the 20th Century Fox films and Monogram films.  The Chan films might have been ""B"" movies at Fox, but they were very good ""B"" movies, with solid production values, memorable actors, and good scripts.  The Chan films at Monogram were at best ""B"" movies entirely, and they often slipped over into ""C"" and ""D"" territory.  The single most memorable thing about these films was not Toler's Chan, who falls victim to malaise, and it was most certainly not the scripts or production values: it was Mantan Moreland in the role of Chan's chauffeur and unwilling assistant Birmingham Brown.  Changing times have led us to look upon Moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to African-Americans, but he was an expert comic, and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence.

If the previous CHANTHOLOGY included some of the best of Monogram's films, TCM SPOTLIGHT: CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION includes some of the worst.  Of the four films included, DARK ALIBI is the best of lot--thanks entirely to Mantan Moreland, who recreates some of his famous variety-stage act with Ben Carter.  It is worth pointing out, however, that all four films are dreadfully uninspired in the use of black actors.  Moreland plays Birmingham Brown in DARK ALIBI, THE TRAP, and THE CHINESE RING; Willie Best plays Chatanooga Brown in DANGEROUS MONEY; and there is a lot of very embarassing knee-knocking ""Ah can't 'cause I be so scared"" nonsense that even Moreland can't put over.  And there isn't a one of them with a script that makes any sense whatsoever... with the possible exception of THE CHINESE RING, which is a curiosity in and of itself.

Roland Winters was never as popular as Warner Oland or Sidney Toler, so THE CHINESE RING gives us the fairly rare opportunity to see what he did with the role.  The answer is: not much.  But the film is actually somewhat stronger than the other four because it an almost shot-for-shot remake of Monogram's 1939 MR. WONG IN CHINATOWN, which might not be a great film but was certainly a better one than the Chan films Monogram was doing at the time.

Ironically, the TCM SPOTLIGHT collection is superior to the other Monogram CHANTHOLOGY collection: althought there is the occasional spice and artifact, the prints are extremely, extremely good.  But in the end it doesn't matter because the films are so bad.  You want Charlie Chan?  Get the 20th Century Fox sets.  The Monogram movies are for completists only.

4083299,5,B00383XZP8,"Although I would have wanted to have Shadows over Chinatown and The Red Dragon included in the set, this is still a great addition to my Charlie Chan collection.  The video quality is great and something that is not mentioned in the description...they have subtitles.",1278460800,3,267,4.933333333333334
4083300,2,B00383XZP8,"I have the first five collections of Charlie Chan movies and thought this might be a nice addition.  I was wrong.  Of the 4 movies, only two are halfway decent.  The first, Dark Alibi, is embarrassing in its use of black actor Martin Moreland aka Birmingham Brown.  The worst combination of stereotyping and bad schtick are visited on Moreland who plays off Benson Fong as ""number 3 son.""  Fong is dreadful in this role and Chan seems angry or bored or both.  The other three movies are fair but the plots are weak and the sidebar shenanigans of Moreland and Victor Sen Young (back, thank goodness, as Chan's number 2 son) detract from what storyline there is.  Save your money for something better than this set!  A real disappointment.",1278374400,4,737,4.658914728682171
4083301,5,B00383XZP8,"Each film in the collection follows the same Charlie Chan
motif with the bungling son that fans should expect in a
Charlie Chan film. I enjoyed these films.",1278028800,3,156,4.607142857142857
4083302,1,B00383XZP8,"First of all, let me say that I'm a big Charlie Chan fan and have loved the mystery, atmosphere and panache of other Sidney Toler films: CC in Rio, CC at the Wax Museum, City in Darkness, CC in Panama, etc. and I couldn't wait for this latest group of movies to be made available. Well, I could have waited a w-h-o-l-e lot longer.

The little things about the productions are just plain silly: people walking in front of the camera as the titles are rolling and actors looking directly at the camera or immediately to its side to fortify themselves with their lines which you find out isn't their greatest stumbling block by a long shot...

But it's the overall experience which is so unfortunate: the director allowed his performers to overact to such a degree that you get the feeling that any minute a giant mollusk or dinosaur is going to enter the scene. The mysteries in the Cinema Classics Collections had great story lines, wonderful screen plays, music and costumes but in this compilation it seems as though some type of comedy was supposed to boost the films instead of creativity and imagination. Unfortunately what the viewer has to bear is terrible slap stick and painful to watch cultural schtick.

Mr. Biggers, Sidney Toler and their fans deserve far better than being asked to pay to see these inconsistent and absurd films.",1277942400,9,1341,4.697872340425532
4083303,4,B00383XZP8,"These 4 Chan movies are enjoyable - Toler is my favourite Chan, and his 3 films here are enjoyable, though his last entry THE TRAP is the poorest of his films.  THE CHINESE RING is my first look at Winters in the role - he plays it rather like Oland with little humour.

The great thing about this set is the amazing quality of the prints/transfers used. Never before have Monogram films ever looked so vivid.  Very sharp and crystal clear with hardly any signs of wear and tear or age related blemishes.  I would also hope that Warner/TCM will release a final set covering the last two Toler titles and the remaining 5 Winters for DVD completion.  Wouldn't it be nice if Warner/TCM could release the Monogram poverty row Lugosi films in the same stunning quality.",1277596800,4,764,4.547445255474453
4083304,5,B00383XZP8,"I am not interestd in living in the past but this series appeals to me. Picture and audio quality is excellent, you know the digital enhancing technology you hear about. For newer generations it is probably of very little interest. It is all about absurd fantasy stories and racial stereotypes, a refreshing brake from reality if you wish.",1276992000,3,339,4.862068965517241
