7801866,3,1934347663,"This dvd is excellent if you know literally nothing about defense. If you have even a weeks knife training, you probably learned everything in this dvd.  He is very concise and clear about all instruction, so deserves a 3*, but if you're looking for a curriculum for knife defense beyond ""knives have a point end,"" and ""there are two zones-red& green,"" I would look elsewhere.",1464566400,,376,4.7846153846153845
