If you're looking for a 'put this muscle here and put that muscle there' approach this is not the disc for you. Creating creatures from scratch is an exploratory process--Carlos technique is to lay down some prismacolor, splash on some solvent, work in and out of the drawing--catching rythms from the abstraction that occurs while retaining a form that looks like it can actaully move around. Works great with the nevill page discs form gnomon who gets more into the explicit rendering of eyes, hypothetical muscle systems of imaginary  creatures and mcuh more, also from gnomon.also check out Calros web site, and see where these techniques can lead. Disc could be better--but it's a glimpse inot workflow, thought process, and evaluation how to get something form absolutely nothing on that blank page. Very High recommendations.",1187827200,3,965,5.069182389937107
8593529,1,B000GETUV0,"I understand most Gnomon DVd's are geared towards a more professional audience;However , this DVD is particularly useless. It starts out REALLY bad with things like: ""ummmm ummm I have no idea what I'm going to do...ummm"" He doesn't really give any useful hints as how to help out with your own designs. It may deliver but I got WAY too disappointed at this DVD to even bother finish watching it.",1185062400,3,396,4.591549295774648
