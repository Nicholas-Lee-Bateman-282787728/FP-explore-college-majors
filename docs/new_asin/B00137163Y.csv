8249404,5,B00137163Y,"The history of this family story is the history of many US citizens who happen to be brown--Mestizo, Native American, or Mexican American.  Many of the tensions of the 1920s are returning in the early 2000s, and the movie is an excellent teaching tool as well as entertainment. Cinematography is beautifully done, and the acting is quite good.  The movie does follow the book (Por Unos Elotes), but leaves of the last chapter, which does change the message somewhat. It was nice to see the Rio Grande Valley treated as the center of a story, but the best part was the development of the characters over the cours of three generations. I would recomend this for any rainy afternoon for the whole family to watch and discuss.  It is also a great date movie.",1259539200,,755,4.619402985074627

It is a coming of age story about a young boy's struggle to face the challenges of growing up without his parents and confront the haunting demons of his past. Oscar grows up and attempts to overcome the resentment incurred after witnessing the brutal murder of his father. Oscar's journey is threaded by the very vivid colors of reality in life including love, hate, faith, fear, hope, revenge, and forgiveness.",1226707200,,637,4.790909090909091
