2473419,5,B000CSTKNS,"This is a great workout. While it took me a few times to really get all the moves down, it's really fun to do. Every time I do it, I feel like I get a really good workout--I'm sweating, having fun, and am pleasantly tired. As another reviewer said, the choreography is interesting, so you can't get bored with this one! I can't wait to try other Christi Taylor workouts.",1166832000,3,370,4.3
2473420,5,B000CSTKNS,"This will definitely get you happily tired !! Great, interesting choreography, feels great, and Christi and her friends are so into the routines, it's just a lot of fun !  I have added it to my regular exercising, and I do it at least a couple times a week. It's 45 minutes. It's perfect for me in the morning when I want to make sure I get in some good cardio for the day.",1152057600,3,373,4.04054054054054
2473421,5,B000CSTKNS,"What a great work out! If you are a bit uncoordinated like me, it may take a few times to get the moves down. Once you get that its so much fun.  You don't even realize you're working out. And Christi's super positive attitude keeps you motivated the whole time. The results are awesome! After doing this video four days a week for three weeks I lost several inches and was finally able to get rid of that  baby pooch I had after having my daughter.",1150416000,6,449,4.209302325581396
2473422,5,B000CSTKNS,"Another great workout from one of the most amazing instructors and choreographers around.  Christi is superb.  This is fast paced and high energy and you'll be sweating and huffing and puffing (all in a good way), and designed to have you burn fat.  It's about 60 minutes and it can be tough at times to keep up, but after a little while, you'll be dancing and singing along too.  There is good music and she cues so well and will sing along with you whilst cuing.  She has great personality and her energy is contagious so before you know it, you've had so much fun that it's over and you've burned heaps of calories and fat.  I really really recommend this.  She is the best.",1136937600,12,677,4.368
8101962,5,B000CSTKNS,I bought this DVD years and years ago from Collage Video when it first came out and I still whip it out every now and then because it's a good video. You need to be familiar with aerobic terminology and have a decent level of coordination. I have several Christi videos and I like them. She takes a basic move and makes it more complicated. Her cueing is perfection.  You will not get all the advanced moves the first couple of times thru. Swallow your pride and just stick with the basic steps until you can move on. You will have the video forever.  Once you have owned a video for a while and do it over and over you will be grateful she doesn't spend a ton of  time breaking things down just so you can do the moves the first time thru.,1482105600,,740,4.125
8101963,4,B000CSTKNS,I love Krissy Taylor choreography. Boy is it a pain in the butt to learn! In this series she includes something called move master which actually takes you through each move if you want to view the video separately so that you can learn them in advance. But I think in this workout she included way too many hamstring curls because it is in almost every single phase so it gets confusing as to where you are in a choreography as you move on and then go back to the beginning. First time through was today and I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out what the heck was going on even though I watched the help guide first and I'm very coordinated. I think next time through I'll have an easier time but the hamstring cobstantly used totally threw me lol it isn't like her. Very good workout though.,1438214400,,814,4.326797385620915
8101964,5,B000CSTKNS,Great work out video..very challenging,1424044800,,38,6.8
8101965,5,B000CSTKNS,"I just purchased this DVD to have a copy of my own. Previously, I'd used the subscription version on TV.

The steps are a little complicated at first but with consistent use they can be mastered. But to be honest, when I became lost in the dance steps I just kept moving, making it up as I went along. You can do jumping jacks, kick your legs, jump rope, anything that keeps your body moving. According to my iPod Fitness Tracker, this burns nearly 300 calories for the 48 minutes and is a little under three miles. Most times I just keep moving to make it three miles which is about 5 minutes more... and all of this is right in the living room. The music is just right and the beat is consistent where each song has the same tempo. That is one of the most helpful things ever for cardio.

What I do when I want to cross-train is to the use the music to jog for 48 minutes. The beats are perfect for this.

I do this on a carpeted floor. However, the carpet is at least thirty years old and I usually wear footies that have traction on the bottom.

I recommend this video and its workout routine.",1393891200,3,1097,4.160377358490566
8101966,2,B000CSTKNS,I like Christi a lot and find her fun.  I own Solid Gold Step and love it.  Figured Id try this for something different not using a step.  I hated the music.  I couldn't handle it.  Bad 70's and early 80's.  Uggh.  Joy to the world?  Devil with a blue dress on?  Just not my style I guess.  Sorry Christi.  What a shame...it looked like a fun workout other wise but I will be selling my copy.,1391040000,,392,3.961038961038961
8101967,5,B000CSTKNS,"If you are into strictly floor aerobics, then add this dvd to your collection!  Full workout (2 segments) is approximately 45 minutes total  but you can do each segment separately.  Each segment is approximately 20 minutes each. Great music and Christi is a great motivator!",1359244800,,274,5.044444444444444
8101968,3,B000CSTKNS,"What i mean is that the video does not allow u time to learn the steps because it moves too fast. i have her other video, fit to dance, and loved it because its easy to learn. This one is too difficult to learn the steps.",1358553600,,221,3.8260869565217392
8101969,5,B000CSTKNS,"I was unsure how I would like this after reading mixed reviews. Let me say, I think it is a fantastic cardio workout for those who have at least moderate coordination skills and/or have some previous knowledge of cardio/step terminology (e.g. repeater, scissors, hamstring curls, etc.).

What makes this workout so great is Christi's choreography and cuing. The entire 45 minutes is made up of only 2 routines, so you do each of them for awhile. Each time it started from the beginning of the combination I was sure I'd forget what I was doing and stumble around, but Christi's cuing is so fantastic that I didn't miss a beat. (This is why I say some prior knowledge of terminology is helpful, but even without it you catch on fairly quickly, as step names are repeated often). She adds on to the choreography bit by bit, starting each move out at a basic level and then varying it to something more difficult. There are 5 people in the video, including Christi. The front row of 3 does the more difficult variations throughout while the back row of 2 does the more basic variations, which are also lower impact. Even though there are only 2 combinations throughout the workout, she constantly adds on to them so I was never bored (or wishing to move on to the next segment). I'd say her cuing makes it easy to follow along, though if you're completely uncoordinated it might be somewhat challenging, as the choreography in and of itself is quite varied.

Her choreography is fantastic. It's not super super danceish, like some workout dvds, but it's definitely more than standard aerobic variations on marching, kicking and jumping. It's some of the best choreography I've seen in a workout dvd. Not only is it interesting and fun, but it really does deceptively give you a full workout. By the end not only did I feel I got a great cardio workout, but my legs and arms were also somewhat fatigued. (The arms just come from holding them up and keeping them moving throughout... which can be more difficult than it sounds). The music is fun and Christi sort of sings some of her cues to the tune of the music, which made me smile each time.

There are a lot of little extras on this dvd, including a breakdown of each of the sections, which would be helpful if you're struggling learning the choreography. There's also a 6 minute bonus ab section and a bonus warmup. The 13 minute bonus cardio is just a straight run through of the ENTIRE final combination from the workout, which is never actually done in the main section. It combines the first workout straight through into the second. I do this sometimes at the end of the workout when I want to do the whole thing together, one final time.

Regarding the comment about not being able to do this on carpet and needing to review the breakdown section multiple times before starting... I agree that Christi's intro could be off putting, but it is her just trying to be helpful. I sort of agree with her non-carpet suggestion and even her suggestion on the type of sneakers you wear (aerobic, with less traction than running sneakers)... the choreography involves a lot of movement that requires you to be able to twist/pivot your foot freely on the floor to avoid risk of a knee injury. It can still be done, you just have to be careful.

I highly recommend this dvd for those who want some fun choreography and a great aerobic workout.",1300406400,7,3388,4.593388429752066
8101970,3,B000CSTKNS,"I purchased this DVD because it was one of the few that didn't mention complicated dance moves or needing special equipment. However, in the short workout preview, the instructor mentions that this workout shouldn't be done on carpet (can be modified to work, but you can't follow the main instructor) and that it is necessary to watch an instructional session multiple times in order to be able to participate in the workout. I just want to pop something in and start my workout, but this was too complicated. I spent money on it so I'll put in the necessary hours to get to the point where I can use this DVD but I don't recommend it. ""Ultimate Fat Burn,"" is much more simple and is a great workout.

(I came to say that after doing the first half of the work out a few times I've gotten pretty good at it and it isn't as difficult as I previously thought. Now I'm going to try the second half of the DVD. It is a great aerobic exercise.)",1208736000,6,940,4.3107344632768365
8101971,1,B000CSTKNS,"I was very excited to see what this tape had to offer.  I noticed that there was an instuctional section of the DVD.  Not thinking twice about it, I started this workout full-force, only to find myself completely standing still.  The choreography is atrocious.  I tried my hardest to keep up with her, only to find out that once I mastered a move, they were onto the next confusing move.  Not being a professional dancer put me at an extreme disadvantage.  But I also did not expect to be buying a ""dance"" workout!  I tried to give this workout a chance, and decided to try to navigate through the instructional section.  No wonder I couldn't follow.  The combinations are too complex.  Maybe I am alone in my opinion, but when I get dressed to exercise, I want to burn calories and sweat.  I DO NOT want to master some useless ""dance routine.""  I applaude anyone who can see this workout to it's completion.

With all that being said, would anyone like to purchase a slightly used copy of this DVD?",1179100800,6,999,4.483333333333333
