4661418,2,B005DR643M,"Seems to be three storylines very tenuously overlapping while occupying most of the movie. First, there's the one about some civil unrest in Thailand which seemed very docudrama like and was boringly distracting. Second, was an unexplained (probably the director felt it was too dumb to try) of a young girl that is part dog/part human (sure). Third, were some Chinese vacationers somewhere in between those storylines. Mostly you just see the vacationers doing typical dumb touristy things which goes on for over half the movie but interspersed with the docudrama of the sign waving civil unrest and dog/girl running around on all fours. Finally the dead mother of dog/girl shows up as a spirit and her body is later found floating in a tank of some liquid. Dog girl dies - end of story.

I watched the movie a second time and have decided that the dog/girl story was creative/different enough and coupled with a few decent, although inexpensive, effects makes the movie worthy of another star.",1319760000,2,995,4.9226190476190474
4661419,3,B005DR643M,"Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict --The Child's Eye sees the Pang Brothers overly reliant on jump scares, with little time spent on really working on the atmosphere of the piece. Small moments occasionally break this trend. A scene where Ling (Elanne Kwong) confronts Quan (Ka Tung Lam) over the disappearance of her friends stands out as a suitably tense encounter, as does a subsequent scene where a mobile phone's ringtone threatens to alert a demon to the presence of Ling, but such moments are rare. All too often, the brothers rely on the soundtrack to build the tension, before unleashing another jump scare. This isn't necessarily such a bad thing when done well, as is the case here, but the lack of a interesting story means the film tends to drag, and its effect is lessened with each repeat viewing.

The cast is fine, but much like the plotting of the film, their performances are too informed by what has come before in the J-Horror genre to offer anything exciting or new. Their roles are also far too generic, with the male members of the cast in particular having little of note to make them memorable (or indeed necessary to the plot).

The theatrical release of The Child's Eye offered a 3D presentation of the film, though the DVD release only offers the movie in good old-fashioned 2D. Much of the 3D appears reliant on gimmicky shots of dismembered hands coming at the screen or bullets exploding in the viewers face; it's hardly subtle, but the loss of the extra dimension means these moments work considerably less well than the Pang Bros. intended.

The Child's Eye is presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer which is hard to fault. The picture is sharp, with a good level of detail. Colors are intentionally muted, lending the film a familiar Pang Brothers look. Black levels are rock solid, which in turns adds a good deal of depth to the image. The 5.1 soundtrack provides a lively mix, with crisp dialogue being complemented by a suitably effective score, and effects work that makes good use of rear speakers.

The DVD comes with a behind-the-scenes featurette, featuring interviews with the cast and crew; a selection of trailers is also included.

4661420,3,B005DR643M,"""If she's locked up there how could she show up in the restaurant."" A group of friends on vacation in Thailand are ready for a relaxing time. When word gets out that rebels are attempting to over through the Prime Minister. On their way to the airport the get the news that it's closed. Being able to only find rooms in a motel that is utterly rundown they decide to wait it out. They soon realize that there is more to the hotel then thought. Having not seen a whole lot of Japanese horror movies (I have seen the re-makes) I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. While this movie did tend to drag a little, it was very creepy and did make me jump a few times. The quality of this is very good, not only is it creepy but there is also a story that keeps you intrigued the entire time. That is not something you can say about most American horror movies. Overall, a very interesting and creepy horror that will creep you out. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think so.

8467341,5,B005DR643M,Usual high standards of the pang name apply.  Own all pang films now and this is one of me faves.  This besides eye and recycle is what I let friends borrow to get into foriegn film.  Good mythos and like the black comedy.  Also love the editing and camera work..never boring.  Can see some parallels to recycle in the heavy CGI sequence :). Also theorizing that the book that is thrown out of the window at the end causes the car behind them to wreck. Is this the car crash that is filmed by handicam by character in the eye 3 (infinity or 10).  I know this movie is necisarily apart of the eye trilogy but the ending could be a connection... My theory anyway.  Also the boyfriend throws it put the window and causes the wreck so she shouldn't continue the curse of harm during pregnancy right? Unless it is their car that wrecks in which case everyone dies in the end but I prefer the car behind theory to hint at a continuation of the curse or a connection to the eye trilogy.,1409097600,,979,4.2594594594594595

8467344,3,B005DR643M,"This is a decent horror flick , that can be a little hard to understand at first but the story is wrapped up at the end so that's ok. This was shot in 3d and you can tell that it was too. there are a few ghosting scenes but mostly the 3d is OUTSTANDING. The depth is exceptional and there are some great effects in this flick. The film concerns six chinese people who get sucked into a spooky hotel. They meet a dog monster , a killer and a ghost. The ghost doesn't pop out at you as much as you would think. This has also got some great 3d cgi effects. I did notice only two scenes with ghosting , but perhaps that was just my eyes.  I was afraid when I bought this it would be a disaster 3d wise like 'shock labrynth'  but it wasn't , it was actually quite good in that regard. There are many scenes that utilize 3d in a creative manner. The acting is well done , but the story is more average than some other pang movies that I have seen. It's worth owning this for the 3d though. There are several featurettes too and cast interviews.  The picture looks outstanding because this is a 2011 movie and that's not old film stock by any means.",1350777600,2,1142,4.066666666666666
8467345,3,B005DR643M,"Childs eye 3D is the first movie to be shot in 3D in Thailand. The film itself is not that bad at all. It's nothing new from what you would expect from the Pang brothers. It's just your normal asian suspense horror. But I will admit this one does carry a little bit more gore to it than what I am used to seeing from the Pang Brothers.

To give a quick brief review of the story, A group of friends are on vaction in Thailand when a big riot hits and the group of friends are stuck at a random hotel in the mean time cause they cant get to the airport due to the riot. At some point one of the girls in the group see's a group of kids that look out of place and tries to be friend them. On the way they find out the kids aren't what they seem to be and the man who does handy work in the hotel may have more to him then what meets ""the eye""...get it? oh never mind i was never good at humor any way. aside from that there is a big twist to all this that i won't lie seems to be out of place for this story but hey that's what makes some of these movies fun though right?

Now for the 3D!!!!!!

For this being the first 3D movie to be done and shot in Thailand I felt they did a pretty good job. There isn't a huge amount of pop outs in this movie but they do have a few fun ones in the mix. One that sticks out in my mind was in the begining of the movie during the riot scene a cop shoots off a gas bomb that goes flying out of the tv and stops about 15 inches away from your face!!!(kind of cool huh?)There was definitly added depth throught the whole movie (not avatar/hugo/tranformers depth but still plenty of good spacing between objects none the less) and from what I can remember there was very little to no ghosting/shadowing that some 3D movies seem to suffer from and seeing I watch 3D on an active plasma 3D that really says some thing.

To sum it up, If you like asain suspense horror with some mild gore and above average 3D effects I think you will probably enjoy this. I would also recomend you watch ""Sector 7 3D"" that has great 3D and is a really fun asian creature feature to watch as well!!!",1346284800,,2111,3.948356807511737
8467346,3,B005DR643M,"I've seen a lot of Asian horror films, but this has got to be the weirdest movie I've ever seen in my life. About halfway through the movie I began to get confused. My confusion only got worse from there. It did not stop me from watching the entire movie, though. I'm not really sure how certain things got to be how they are in the film, and would have liked an explanation, but no big deal. It's not a fantastic movie; but if you've got time to kill and want to see something a little different, I'd recommend watching it.",1340755200,,524,4.198019801980198
