8561618,5,6305228957,"The fourth and last VHS tape, which contains a historic dialog between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Chan (Zen) Master Sheng Yen, is amazing. Here you really see how the two masters' wisdom at work. It's less of a debate than a sharing of common grounds. What was interesting is that the Dalai Lama in this discussion draws primarily from his learnings of the Kagyu and Nyingma schools (the teachings of Mahamudra and Dzogchen) and less from the Gelug school in which he belongs. Sheng Yen's discussion of seeing ""self-nature,"" or the nature of emptiness, in Chan is impression, which the Dalai Lama was very curious about and asked a lot of questions.",1256688000,2,654,4.745614035087719
