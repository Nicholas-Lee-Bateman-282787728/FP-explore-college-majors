1901157,5,B0000A2ZR5,"This movie is very folksy, and the ending is not what I expected.  However the story is very interesting.",1404950400,,105,4.526315789473684
1901158,5,B0000A2ZR5,Wonderful characters and story . Love the fact that it was filmed in large part in VT in places I recognize !,1402099200,,109,4.0

1901160,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Beautifully written book on the French / American prejudices on both sides of the Derby line,
the competition for jobs, what true loggers went through.
I felt as if the entire story happend right next to Lake Memphremagog in Newport, Vermont.
Beautiful read, full of period details and historic insights to life in the late 1800s.",1397520000,,330,4.910714285714286
1901161,5,B0000A2ZR5,"This is one of those ""little"" movies you stumble across while browsing and discover it to be wonderful discovery. Rip Torn is a consummate actor and he makes you believe this character really lived....Well worth the time...Author Joyce Bishop Morris",1394323200,,249,5.25
1901162,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Excellent acting, It made me laugh and cry.  It`s about  real life here in Vermont !  It has become my favorite movie.",1391472000,,118,4.2727272727272725
1901163,4,B0000A2ZR5,"I had a hard time understanding this movie.  It just never made that much sense to me, but I had a hard time understanding what was said.  I have horrible sound on my TV, and always use closed caption....it would not work with this movie.  I kept watching it thinking it would get better but it never did and ended strange.  I will watch it again once I get a sound bar.......then maybe it will make more sense.",1382659200,,411,4.230769230769231
1901164,3,B0000A2ZR5,"I think the topic is good for our current times and the actors were very good but I was disappointed with the sound quality and with the whole presentation of the story - could have been so, so much better.",1380067200,,206,4.175
1901165,2,B0000A2ZR5,It wasn't no where near as good as I thought it would be. But then again each to their own. I probably wouldn't watch it a second time.,1376870400,,135,3.857142857142857
1901166,5,B0000A2ZR5,Love this so much. A touching story you want to see again and again. I definately recommend this movie for all.to see and buy if your a movie buff and collect great movies.,1375142400,,172,4.242424242424242
1901167,4,B0000A2ZR5,This was a beautiful and haunting story and the acting was tremendous.  Rip Torn should have received an academy award for his perfomance.,1374624000,,138,5.0
1901168,4,B0000A2ZR5,"I really liked this movie and all the characters, but the ending was a real let-down in my opinion....quite a bizarre ending, like there could be a sequel.",1361491200,,155,4.571428571428571
1901169,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Good wholesome movie, just slow going in the beginning. It is worth the waiting to see it to the end.",1359590400,,101,4.1
1901170,4,B0000A2ZR5,I bought this movie because of the cast and other reviews.  Not exactly what I expected but all in all it was a very good movie.,1357603200,,128,3.923076923076923
1901171,4,B0000A2ZR5,"I like movies set in the 20's. Was interesting to see how people chose to live, but for some was only way of life they knew. I won't comment on ending!",1357257600,,151,3.903225806451613
1901172,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Kind of a sleeper but a fun ride. You don't find people like these anymore. Rip Torn's character is one H--- of a man, his mission and journey is age old and his partner is unforgetable.",1356739200,,186,4.194444444444445
1901173,1,B0000A2ZR5,I did not enjoy the movie. It seemed very long. It went on and on forever. I would not recommend it for any age group.,1356566400,,118,3.76
1901174,4,B0000A2ZR5,"As you would expect, Rip Torn turns in a bigger than Life performance, but even the Ripper can't steal this movie from Tantoo Cardinal.  Wow, what a performance!  She apparently even plays without some teeth.  I've seen her in ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Black Robe"", and I wish I could find more of her.  She deserves an Oscar.

The only weakness of the film is a miscast (and unimpressive) Michael J. Fox.  Treat Williams has only three short scenes, and was okay, but I can't figure why he was cast at all.",1354665600,,507,4.456521739130435
1901175,5,B0000A2ZR5,haven't had a chance to watch this movie yet. shipped after the others but was out of stock and was promptly notified it was on back order.,1353456000,,139,4.185185185185185
1901176,4,B0000A2ZR5,This would have been rated 5 stars if the dvd hadn't been rattling around loose in it's case when it arrived.,1332720000,,109,4.238095238095238
1901177,5,B0000A2ZR5,this is also a good flick not just because I am from Vt. Its a good story and well done. its works good to.,1332547200,,107,3.5
1901178,5,B0000A2ZR5,"I picked this movie up for $3 someplace and didn't expect too much. Boy, was I surprised! The acting was superb, the writing and dialogue was exquisite. In fact, the movie was a 5 star movie in every way someone might rate a movie.
""Stunning,"" ""Fantastic. A must see."" ""Magnificent."" are all ways his movie is described. I agree.",1296345600,,329,4.593220338983051
1901179,5,B0000A2ZR5,"This movie is a love story between two mountain people who live off the land and ""progress"" attempts to drive them off it.  The scenery shot in Vermont and New Hampshire is gorgeous.  The performances were incredible.  There is not a wasted word or scene in this movie.  All are essential to understanding the lead characters and the flow of the story.  You will be riveted to the television screen.",1283126400,,399,4.642857142857143
1901180,3,B0000A2ZR5,"I bought this film based on a couple of reviews that rated it as 5 star.  We found it a strech to get 3 stars.  I love Michael J. Fox, but his character is really minor and his part was stiff and really added nothing to the plot.  I think he was added to the cast strictly as name draw.  Rip Torn did a fairly good job of what he was asked to do: play a stubborn old coot with nothing but a lease on some federal land to stand on. This is coupled with his inhospitable character's attitude, his desire to live a completely isolated life with his common law indian 'subserviant', less than equal companion, he did a good job.  The maneuvers employed by the developers and the sheriff are sluggish and inept at conveying the importance of the project. Their actions are so amaturish as to be unbelievable. The script makes the project sound like some shady land grabbing dealings trying to oust a true nature loving native off of his birthright land, and that the the goal merely represents some big business pushing down little people.  I think, after seeing the whole thing, it was an attempt to say progress is bad, especially if it seems to hurt even one single individual, no matter how wrong he or his motives prove to be.  He was offerred 100 times what his 'occupancy' lease was worth. He was offerred to save a tremendous area as a preserve for generations. All while he actually had no ligitimate claim to any timber or other resources on the land.  The fact that he, at the end, later destroys most of what he claimed he was protecting, exacerbates the situation and proves the plot senseless.  Some good scenery, but mostly waiting for something significant to happen between the characters and or the plot.  It didn't happen, it doesn't come together.",1264982400,,1762,4.512578616352202
1901181,5,B0000A2ZR5,First saw this film shortly after it came out and was surprised it didn't walk away with all the prizes at Sundance.  Its a bitter sweet film as much a love story as a movie about the little guy standing up to power and money. Left me with tears in my eyes but not the typical feeling you get of being manipulated into it by  the writer.  Great directing by Jay Craven and a cast he was astoundingly lucky to work with.  Stellar performances.  I would have given both the lead actors Oscars.  The question would be which should get best actor and which should get best supporting actor.  I can't decide.  Glad to finally have it out in DVD.,1242000000,,640,4.275
1901182,5,B0000A2ZR5,"While this is one of my favorite movies and stories from my life, I might be a tad biased. I grew up in the kingdom and my heart will always be from there.
Before i go any further, lets just say, Amazon reviews suck. Virginia?
Are you on crack? Did your writers review anything? It's Vermont morons, not Virginia.
Frank Howard Moshers book was wonderful, as was Jay Cravens adaptation of the story.
Filmed where i grew up,the people I know in the movie were great. The story which rang true for many people when the power companies and or government needed right of way, destroyed their land, and lives. This is real life, sadly not fiction
I watched this movie at the Catamont theater in St. Johnsbury VT when it came out. You should own this and watch this",1237852800,,758,4.421428571428572
1901183,5,B0000A2ZR5,"The best movie I have ever seen! Should have won best director, best picture, best actor and best actress.",1203811200,,106,4.631578947368421
1901184,4,B0000A2ZR5,"Rip Torn plays a gritty old logger who just wants to keep his forest and trout streams in tact but is suddenly pitted against Michael J. Fox and a corporation that wants to build a big dam that will take them all away. The movie is commendable for not making the dam-builders horrible monsters and Torn the epitome of moral righteousness: the former want to bring modern services to remote areas and the latter is not an example of political correctness. Tantoo Cardinal plays Torn's wife, and she is perhaps the biggest asset in the movie; she is a spunky and sensitive actress. The storyline is a strong one (it's set during the 1920s), and the photography is stunning. Made on a tight budget, the production makes up for cut corners with sincerity of purpose. Pretty good movie, all around.",1164067200,,793,4.671428571428572
1901185,5,B0000A2ZR5,This film seems to be about as authentic as possible reflecting wilderness life near the turn of the century.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat as the story developes with an ending that is unexpected.,1153699200,,203,4.486486486486487
1901186,5,B0000A2ZR5,"This movie was filmed in Vermont by moderate to successful actors filming for a Vermont Film maker.

The story is totally believable, the charators are believeable and it is a wonderful movie to just sit and watch on a Sunday afternoon.",1141948800,,236,4.7560975609756095
1901187,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Noel was an idealist. He wanted things to stay the way they were.

he leased the land he, and his live in indian squaw lived on, and distiled cedar oil for a living, and he didn't aim to give it up

for any amount of money, because it would destroy his livelyhood.

He absolutly couldn't be reasoned with, with even his best friend.

This story is full of adventure.and conflict.

It's one of the most underated films I can think of.

Rip Torn, and Tanto Cardinal were perfect in their depictions

of the characters they played. In fact if I'd had anything to do with it Tantoo Cardinal would have gotten an oscar for her performance. She was phenomenal!!",1108684800,,655,4.453781512605042
1901188,5,B0000A2ZR5,"If I could give this more stars I would...... The photography is beautiful and gives justice to the setting.... The music is perfect but the acting is just incredible. What a pair... Rip Torn as ""Mister"" became my favorite all time actor with this one. Tantoo Cardinal is perfect in her role.",1074902400,,292,4.634615384615385
1901189,5,B0000A2ZR5,"I caught this on PBS, and it was very good!  A great story, and what actors!
It's a period piece, set in the late 1920's.  Rip Torn is this lumberjack type guy who has a Native American Indian woman companion he hangs out with all the time.  There is a dam being built around his property, and the builders are trying to buy him out.  He does everything he can to not give in to their bribery.  It's fine drama, and some comedic momments sprinkled in.  I thought the acting by both Torn, and the woman was outstanding! I always liked him.  She was just amazing.  It's movies like this that have the truly talented actors.
PBS doesn't edit either, and there were no commercials.  Both my husband and I liked it alot.  Highly recommend!",1018396800,,734,4.37037037037037
1901190,5,B0000A2ZR5,"Director Jay Craven's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's 'Where the rivers flow north' is one of the finest transitions from literature to the screen I've ever witnessed.  Craven is obviously an admirer of Mosher's work -- he also directed 'A stranger in the Kingdom', another piece of fine writing from this Vermont writer.
The cast is absolutely superb -- especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal.  Torn throws himself into what could be the finest role of his career with such totality that he BECOMES Noel Lord, the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is the center of this story.  Tantoo Cardinal's portrayal of Lord's live-in housekeeper/common-law wife is dead-on as well.  I'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for Oscars when this film was released -- I suppose it was overlooked among all of the 'blockbusters' that year, which is a real shame.  Performances of this calibre should be acknowledged.  The only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by Michael J. Fox -- Fox is a good actor in his own right, but he just looks too much like a kid in this role.  I guess there's a curse attached to youthful looks, no matter how much people want them.
The score by the Horseflies is also first rate -- it fits the mood and scenery perfectly.
Craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century Vermont to the screen -- locations, angles, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story.
And the story itself...?  One of the most compelling portrayals of the fiercely independent American pioneer spirit ever -- a trait that is on the wane in this day and age.  When it appears in modern times, the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain.  In Noel Lord, we have a character whom we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness.
This is not a stodgy 'period piece' -- this is a vibrant look at an era that is gone, and a type of character that has all but vanished.  These are not gold-plated heroes, but real people, with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them. struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live.  Like today, there are those who weild power that would have it otherwise.
This is one of my favorite films of the modern era -- I cannot recommend it highly enough.",997228800,,2437,4.602771362586605
1901191,4,B0000A2ZR5,An old man's pride and stubborness does battle with progress in the woods of 1927 Vermont. Fine performances and music make for a film worth seeing.,954720000,,148,4.730769230769231

7995518,5,B0000A2ZR5,Really enjoyed the movie. Loved the atmosphere and the story.  I enjoyed every performance.  Rip Torn was great and so was Tantoo Cardinal. I thought MJF played cold and calculating very well. Very engaging.,1513123200,,207,5.0588235294117645

7995521,4,B0000A2ZR5,"Other reviews have described much of the details.  Both Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal give spectacular performances, especially Tantoo. Michael Fox, however, is out of place in this movie. Otherwise, it is a solid movie showing the clash of stubborn independence and greed.  More significantly, though, the film shows how pride and ignorance devastate not only the world around it, but the lives of those who feel it. Not a happy move, but well done.",1493769600,,449,4.973333333333334
