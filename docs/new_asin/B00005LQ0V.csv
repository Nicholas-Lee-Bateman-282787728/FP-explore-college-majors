1622930,1,B00005LQ0V,"As I had watched the original series, the differences were very apparent in the change of actors, location and characters and even the theme of the story.  It would have been nicer to have had the ending of the original series as the flow wasn't good.  I was very disappointed with their new take on the original series.",1181433600,3,320,4.5

1622932,3,B00005LQ0V,"After having watched the 20 episodes of the original Christy series, I was dismayed and disappointed with these subsequent videos.  Not only are some key actors and actresses missing but the entire atmosphere of ""Cutter's Gap"" is topsy-turvy compared to the original episodes.  I feel for the returning actors and actresses (Neil McNeil, Tom, Opal, etc.) that had to watch this change take place and still try to respond like the old characters did to their surroundings.  These new videos (in my humble opinion) demean the mountain people whereas in the original there was nobility to their characters even in the midst of their ignorance.  Not only that, but the handling of God and Christianity in these new videos is ridiculous -- throwing around cutsy little sayings, etc. with no depth.

Unlike the originals, these videos portray life there in one dimension.  There are too many dramatic elements just seemingly thrown in for the sake of action -- no real thinking behind the events.  It seems to me someone meant well but missed the mark completely.  Very sad.  I could easily just get up and walk away from these movies even as badly as I wanted to see the outcome for Christy's marital decision.

So I caution those that were touched and moved by the original episodes.  They were truly over with the last episode depicting Christy holding her engagement ring from David in one hand and Doc McNeil riding up on his little horse (they do give him a larger, more handsome horse in the new videos).  Finishing those episodes in your mind is much better than contaminating them with these new imposter videos.

Thank you for the space to air my thoughts.

p.s. I am told by my daughter, and I agree to an extent, that the new actresses for Ruby Mae and Fairlight were the only ones that lived up to the original characters.",1177459200,23,1829,4.728706624605678
1622933,5,B00005LQ0V,"We've read the book, watched the TV series, and bought all three of the DVD episodes.  Although many of the actors are different than the TV series, we thought they did a good job and portrayed their parts with understanding and professionalism.  I get a kick out of reading reviews where the actors are accused of over-acting.  We especially watched for that.  We didn't see any.  Of course, I've only directed and/or produced over 500 films and videos with several Emmys and other awards so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the programs and can't wait until we can actually visit the site where Christy took place.  We will view the series at least once a year.  We recommend the series to anyone who enjoys celebrating the lives of people who make a difference in this world.  Christy certainly did.",1140652800,9,846,4.662162162162162
1622934,2,B00005LQ0V,"I love the book Christy and though I think it's usually hard for a tv or movie version of a book to totally live up to it's namesake, the first series did this job pretty well I think.  This version, however, was overacted (Other than Dr. McNeil's character which I still think was acted pretty well),and the characters didn't have the heart and spirit that they did in the book.  The overacting and poorly done camera work make what is a great story seem hokey and dumbed down.  Also many of the characters aren't very well cast either.  I don't recommend this version at all but still recommend the book and the other television version of this story.",1030320000,15,653,4.508474576271187
1622935,4,B00005LQ0V,"I loved the television show, and it was hard for me to get into the new characterizations of the characters.  It was great to see some returning members, espically McLennan who played Neil McNeil.  I think he really holds this mini-series together, and is the only person (other than a few of the Cutter Gap residents) who doesn't overact or seem fake in this movie.
Maybe it's just hard for me to accept that different people are playing the beloved characters like Chirsty, and Miss Alice, etc. but I think I'm not alone when I say many of the characters didn't seem as realistic as they did in the series.  The new Miss Alice probably seemed the most over-acted and fake out of everyone.  Her ""Thee's and thou's and thy's"" just didn't cut it.
However, all in all it was an excellent story and picks up where the series leaves off.  The new Chirsty did a decent job (certainly better than I ever could) and it is worth buying or watching on television.  I hope that PAX will create more ""Christy"" episodes, and even though I'm not really one for wholesome family television and christian shows, this really is a wonderful show for anyone.",1017014400,9,1140,4.563725490196078
1622936,5,B00005LQ0V,"This continuation of COTH Part 1 begins 3 months after Dr. Neil MacNeill has left Cutter Gap, TN. Christy Huddleston is seen growing ever more conflicted over her engagement to David Grantland while preoccupied with a wedding that is two weeks away. Dr. MacNeill's unexpected return to the cove further complicates the young woman's emotional state.
A surprise invitation from one of the suitors is the prelude to an impassioned declaration as the skies break into what becomes a torrential rainstorm. The risk of traveling back to the mission house in Cutter Gap necessitates staying overnight in a nearby cabin. A dramatic confrontation leads to the most revealing, emotionally bare conversations of the movie.
Stewart Finlay-McLennan gives the single best, most affecting performance of the entire movie and possibly his career in a scene that is pivotal for his character, Dr. Neil MacNeill. Lauren Lee Smith remains luminescent and vivacious in her performance as Christy Huddleston. James Waterston plays an earnest and likeable David Grantland. Lush mountain scenery, a well-written script and extremely good acting from the cast make this movie a joy for the mind and heart.
The subtitle for the movie is ""A New Beginning."" By the end of the movie and of the storm, the viewer sees the seeds for renewal in the lives of several characters. The potential for continuation of this classic story is well worth the effort and more than worthy of the viewer's time.",1013558400,15,1468,5.095435684647303

1623051,5,B00005LQ0V,"Please remember, that each of the original cast were asked if they wanted to return and finished the story.  But a lot of them chose Not to - including Kelly Martin ( Christy ) and Randall Batinkoff ( David).

These newer Christy films were taken from Catherine Marshall's last known scribblings and notes she had written down for a sequel to the actual Christy Novel.  ""The producers drew Christy's ultimate romantic decision from notes for an unfinished sequel Christy novel that were discovered among Catherine Marshall's possessions after her death.""

While I too enjoy the original TV Series with Kelly Martin, I like these 3 new Christy movies just as much - if not more!  :)  I had been hunting down the DVDs of them and finally found them.  Sadly with the Kelly Martin version, they did not stay faithful to the book in a lot of ways.

I can highly recommend these newer Christy DVDs completely.  They are:  1. Christy: Return to Cutter Gap, 2. Christy: A Change of Seasons and 3. Christy: A New Beginning",1387756800,2,1013,4.672316384180791

1623057,4,B00005LQ0V,There are three movies that conclude the Christy series.  Some of the minor characters are the same and the doctor is the same but the main characters are all new.  They are weak compared to the original cast you took the journey with.  You don't feel the connection you did in the original series.,1362355200,,298,4.481481481481482

1623072,2,B00005LQ0V,I have watched the first series that came out on television. The first Christy was amazing to watch and share in the lives with the characters on screen or in the book. But after they found a new Christy to play the part in the continuing stories on dvd it all went down hill. It does not have a clear picture and the people that play in it are not relaxed or do well in their parts.,1347235200,,383,3.987012987012987
1623073,3,B00005LQ0V,"After watching the whole 2 seasons of TV episodes, we eagerly watched the PAX movies. (sigh)  I guess our expectations were too high.  Just NOT the same. Neil the doctor and a few of the residents are the only actors you'll recognize. The Miss Alice character is milk toast. The reverend has no passion for Christy. None of the set is even in the same geographical place. The structures are all of an era 50 yrs later. Everyones clothes are 20 to 30 yrs later and NO ONE IS DIRTY.

1623090,4,B00005LQ0V,"I am a long-time fan of the original Christy series starring Kellie Martin in the title role. I wasn't impressed by the follow-up to the series, ""Christy: The Return to Cutter Gap"", especially with the startling changes in casting - Lauren Lee Smith as Christy had none of the earnestness and wide-eyed sincerity that was embodied by Kellie Martin. But, after that disappointing and lacklustre episode, I decided to give the second episode in the series a try, and was pleasantly surprised by the improved quality in acting.

In ""Change of Seasons"", a typhoid epidemic threatens the already fragile community of Cutter Gap, and Christy [Lauren Lee Smith] loses a beloved friend. This gives rise to a crisis of faith in Christy - she rails at God and wonders how a benevolent God could take away someone who was so good. In this particular episode, we witness Lauren Lee Smith coming into her acting - she is more convincing in her role here than she was in ""Return to Cutter Gap"", though by no means on par with Kellie Martin in terms of acting skills. The actor who replaces Randall Batinkoff as minister and preacher David, James Waterston, is also much more credible in his role here and there is genuine chemistry between him and Christy. David here is also much more convincing in his role as the staunch minister who firmly believes in his faith in God and helps Christy overcome her anger and temporary loss of faith.

I am still rather disappointed by Diane Ladd's performance as Ms Alice, and feel that her role will always be overshadowed by the superior acting of Tyne Daly in the original Christy. Dr MacNeill as played by Stewart Finlay-McLennan [the original actor] doesn't get much time in this particular episode but his acting is still as assured as ever in the role of the cynical mountain doctor who still has issues with God.

All in all, I liked this episode and felt it was not only entertaining, but ably handled the crisis of faith issue. I am now looking forward to viewing the last episode 'A New Beginning"".",1236297600,,2034,4.69187675070028
