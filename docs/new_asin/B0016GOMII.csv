He has 2 sons. The elder is Srikant (Raaj Kumar), a police inspector, highly conscious of his duties, while the younger, Rajnikant (Faroz Khan) is a lothario, studing in a city college. Rajnikant returns to his home on a short holiday. A letter addressed to him, but mistakenly opened by his brother Srikant, reveals that Rajnikant has a girl friend and she is to bear a child from him. Rajnikant confesses his act of indiscretion to his brother. Srikant, thereupon, appeals to him to return to his girl friend and get married to her, unmindful of their father's wrath. Rajnikant appears to listen to his elder brother's advice and leaves his home to join his girl friend, though he has different ideas about settling account with her.
Next The girl's father arrives at the Major Chandrakant's house claiming that Rajnikant had murdured his pregnant daughter and he had murdured Rajnikant in a train. What will the Major do? How will Srikant respond? This is an excellent rare movie with a brilliant script and fantastic performances from Ashok Kumar and Raaj kumar, well directed by Phani Majundar.
