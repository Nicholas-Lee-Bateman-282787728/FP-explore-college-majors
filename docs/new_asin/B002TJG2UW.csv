8380190,5,B002TJG2UW,"As a high school teacher of Early U.S. history, this video provides the best description of the unsettled times between the end of the American Revolution and the convening of the Constitutional Convention that I have ever seen.  It describes the class conflicts of the times, describing the plight of the poor farmers/veterans who were losing their land, and demonstrating how the civil unrest in New England created fear among the wealthier classes.  This film illustrates the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation like no other, and helps students understand why the U.S. Constitution is a much more conservative document than the Declaration of Independence.",1483488000,,668,5.352380952380952

8380192,5,B002TJG2UW,"Your video on Shays' Rebellion was the highlight of our presentation in History -- it brought the explanations in our textbooks to life. It also helped our class identify with the farmers' struggles and relate to their determined effort. Thank you for making such an outstanding film!
