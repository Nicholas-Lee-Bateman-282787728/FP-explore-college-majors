8602290,1,B00021R7YO,"WARNING: This DVD is a hastily assembled blatant attempt at a cash grab for those who have very superficial memories of the Disco era.
Being a big Disco listener, I thought that this might be an interesting, though cheesy purchase. It promised rare Disco videos, a non-stop Disco music mix in surround sound and other extras, like a jukebox feature, quiz and origins of Disco feature.
Looking at the tracklist, I knew it was a very commercial sampling of some disco hits that were owned by Universal Music, so I wasn't expecting very much. (While I enjoy the more popular Disco tunes...I'm a bigger fan of Disco music from Salsoul, West End, and Prelude Records) However, after ""experiencing"" this DVD, I think that even my lowered expectations were too high.
First, let's go through the 7 music videos:
The Gap Band - Oops Upside Your Head
this is live concert footage of the band, but the audio sounds like it's coming from a tin can off in the distance. There are no mids or lows sonically, just highs.
Peaches & Herb - Shake Your Groove Thing
this ""music video"" is actually a promo clip for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which did have this remixed version of the song on the soundtrack. No sign of Peaches & Herb here at all visually.
ABBA - Dancing Queen
taken directly off their video collection
Donna Summer - I Feel Love
an intriguing live version with a live band replacing Giorgio Moroder's synth and drum programming. The sound is atrocious. Donna does a bizarre choreographed robot dance to the music, which is worth the cost of the DVD. Priceless.
Kool and the Gang - Celebration
this is the album version of the song dubbed over scratchy film footage of the Gang performing a live version of the song.
The Jackson 5 - I Want You Back
this is obviously a promo clip for the ""Motown 40"" collection. It cuts together various clips of the Jackson 5 performing interspersed with pictures and footage of many other Motown stars. The version of ""I Want You Back"" is not the original, but the remixed ""I Want You Back '98"" by Puff Daddy (aka P.Diddy). Not very Disco at all.
Thelma Houston - Don't Leave Me This Way
Possibly the worst ""video"" of the bunch. This is not the original Disco classic on Motown, but a remake done by Thelma in the mid-90's. It is in a Euro Hi-NRG remix style done by Italian producers, and the video is shoddily cheap. Thelma cavorts in various nonsensical outfits (including a nun and cowboy get-up!!), while being attacked by clips of cityscapes and bad computer FX. Painful to watch and even harder to listen to.
Now, we come to the audio portion, you can listen to the 18 songs in a non-stop Disco Party mix (which you cannot skip forward or backward), or use the jukebox feature, which does allow you to choose and order which songs to listen to. It seems a bit redundant to me. Why not just have the one version which is skippable? Both versions are accompanied by visuals of lights and disco balls. Fairly cheeseball.
Audio portion tracklisting:
The Gap Band - Oops Upside Your Head
Lipps Inc. - Funkytown
Peaches & Herb - Shake Your Groove Thing
Brothers Johnson - Stomp
Yvonne Elliman - If I Can't Have You
The Real Thing - Can You Feel The Force
The Real Thing - You To Me Are Everything
ABBA - Dancing Queen
Barry White - You're The First, The Last, My Everything
Gloria Gaynor - I Will Survive
Donna Summer - I Feel Love
Kool & The Gang - Ladies Night
The Miracles - Love Machine
A Taste Of Honey - Boogie Oogie Oogie
Edwin Starr - Contact
KC & The Sunshine Band - Get Down Tonight
T-Connection - Do What You Gotta Do
Van McCoy - The Hustle
By far the worst are the so-called ""extras"". The ""Top 50 Disco Hits of All-Time"" is just a text countdown of songs chosen by discomusic.com. There are some good selections here, but some questionable choices in my opinion. Also ""Cherchez La Femme"" is somehow mispelled as ""Che Che Femm"".
The ""Origins of Disco"" essay is laughable, explaining absolutely nothing about the real roots of how Disco came to be. The author seems to be unsure whether they have correct information: ""Some say disco started in the early 70's...Others believe Disco really started in the mid-70's..."" I give a couple of brownie points for mentioning Tom Moulton, who created the first extended mixes and 12"" singles.
The ""Quiz"" is based mostly on songs that are in the collection. Guess enough correctly and you're ""rewarded"" (or is that punished?) with a video for ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor. Yet again we have original footage dubbed over with the horrifyingly dated ""Dance Remix"" version from the mid-90's found on the Priscilla, Queen of the Desert soundtrack.
All in all, there is NOTHING to recommend about this DVD. It seems like a cheap ploy to grab money from gullible audiences who know nothing about Disco.
If you'd really like to know about Disco, please read ""Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture 1970-1979"" by Tim Lawrence. Other good reads include ""My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep on Dancin'"" by Mel Cheren and ""Chic: Everybody Dance: The Politics of Disco"" by Daryl Easlea. You can also listen to any of the ""Best Disco Album In The Universe"" series of 10 CDs or anything from Salsoul, West End Records and Prelude Records.
I'd give no stars for this DVD, but the 1 star is for Donna Summer's electric robot dance during ""I Feel Love"". The audio portion is decent, but you'd be better off buying a CD instead.",1106956800,,5428,4.579650565262076
