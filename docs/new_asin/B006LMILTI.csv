8597806,5,B006LMILTI,"For those of you like myself who own 3D displays, you
have probably have noticed the lack of intriguing content
being released to the Blu-ray over the past few months.
It has certainly felt, to me, that there has been a drought of
appealing titles for enthusiasts to sink their teeth into.  Well,
folks, I am very proud to announce that there has been a
new IMAX Blu-ray released over the past week that is certain
to bring some fresh air to this format, certain to revive the
passion in all of us to who want to enjoy the very best content
that can be brought to our 3D screens.

Born To Be Wild is a delightful documentary that explores
the bond between humans and animals.  Narrated by Morgan
Freeman, this narrative brings viewers to nurseries in Kenya
and Borneo where we witness the remarkable efforts of two
elderly women, Daphne M. Sheldrick and Birut Mary Galdikas,
who raise orphaned elephants and orangutans.  These animals
have had their families killed by poachers and now it is up to
Sheldrick and Galdikas to foster them until they are no longer
in need of human help.  After all, these are animals that were
born to be wild.

From start to finish, Born To Be Wild manages to captivate
the senses thanks to Cinematographer David Douglas' stunning
photography of the regions and its inhabitants.  Of course, the
main focus of this film is the abundance of baby elephants and
orangutans who will certainly delight adolescent and adult
audiences alike. Highlights here are a group of elephants playing
soccer and an orangutan named Ombray who gets into all sorts
of mischief and clings to his human friend while riding a motorcycle.
Though there is very little educational material to be found here,
the movie remains innocently adorable, playful and friendly throughout
which makes for perfect family entertainment.

Born To Be Wild is an amazing spectacle to behold at home in
3D  It is one of the most utterly gorgeous presentations I have
seen in this format to date.  The picture is as razor sharp as it gets,
allowing the eyes to feast upon a remarkable level of detail that is
so life-like, that one feels immediately immersed in it.  This is
truly one of those ""reach out and touch it"" kind of experiences
thanks to the complete absence of any artifacts or compression.
Colors look amazingly rich -- most evident in shots of deep blue sky,
lush green forest and the reds, oranges and browns found within the
landscape.  Overall, there is spectacular color stability to be found here.

All the grandstanding I have done about this transfer thus far is
now elevated to the  ""nth degree"" with a 3D presentation that
tops the very best of IMAX Blu-ray offerings.  First, it should be
noted that this documentary was specifically choreographed for
the format.  For that reason, shots are carefully constructed in a
manner that there are always objects in the foreground, middle and
background.  This careful consideration to photography gives every
scene an outstanding level of natural depth and realism.

While the documentary doesn't spend its time throwing objects out
at the audience, I was still very pleased to see several instances
of pop-outs (most notably an open hinged door) that gave me the
WOW moments I craved.  Best of all, the entire presentation seemed
to be void of any sort of crosstalk/ghosting.  For this reason, one
can expect to remain completely immersed in the visual experience
without any distractions.

Elevating the visuals is a completely engulfing 5.1 DTS-MA surround
track that turns any living room into a living forest.  I was completely
impressed with the level of detail in the jungle and rainforest ambience
that contributed to filling the rears with an impressive array of insect
noise and panning effects.

Born To Be Wild arrives as a 3D Blu-ray combo package.  Both
Blu-ray 3D and 2D versions of the feature reside on the same disc
with an additional copy on DVD.  Also included is an Ultraviolet code
that allows you to freely stream or download this title to your computer
or compatible device.  The Blu-ray combo packaging is encased in
a lenticular cardboard slipcover.

There are 6 webisode special features included on the Blu-ray disc.

While there's nothing particularly extraordinary about Born To Be
Wild other than its spectacular 3D imagery, its that one factor alone
that makes this a highly worthy purchase.  For as far as IMAX 3D
presentations are concerned, Born To Be Wild can be placed at the
very top of the list as the very best available on the format.

Unfortunately, the the Blu-ray is grossly overpriced for its 41 minute
presentation. It's apparent the studios are still price gouging on a
format still rising from its infancy.  I was fortunate enough to snag
this for $25 during a limited Amazon price drop, would highly
recommend everyone wait for that opportunity to repeat itself.",1453075200,,4866,4.854721549636804
