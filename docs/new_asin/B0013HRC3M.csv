8251017,5,B0013HRC3M,"I like the juxtaposition of the different leadership styles of Jack Welch versus Alfred Sloan. It gave me a lot of fodder for how I lead and how that can change based on what's needed at the time.  Very insightful. They each present completely different styles for different times. Unfortunately, with this economy, Sloan is now more relevant than ever!
Also, I enjoyed seeing the human element of their lives, what their close friends or business associates thought and how that impacted their philosophy of management. I like that because it rounds out the characters versus them just droning on theoretically. It makes it more real.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1220918400,,665,4.981981981981982
