so called human beings are capable of..... you must watch this. Horrific story based on what are true events all over the world. Like it
or hate it you will feel something.",1369612800,,308,4.327586206896552
8175546,5,B000N8OXM0,"This film tells a candid story based on actual events. It deals with a subject matter which may be uncomfortable to watch, but does it with grace and honesty, and isn't at all over-the-top or gratuitous in any way. The story is thought-provoking, moving, and engaging, the characters real and sympathetic, and the acting done by Anamaria Marinca and John Simm is understated and superb. Marinca won several awards for this role, including a BAFTA for Best Actress. The film itself won several BAFTAS, as a matter of fact, though, sadly, John Simm was mysteriously passed over. One of the best actors of his generation, Simm really should be garnering more attention -and awards. Few people can play subtlety and honest feeling the way he does -in fact, his performance here, along with Marinca's, truly is what makes the film worth watching.",1245456000,6,841,4.929577464788732
8175547,3,B000N8OXM0,"This movie was shot in a documentary style. It brutally and realistically depicts those European girls who were sold to prostitution by false promises of good jobs in other countries. There are raping, and beating scenes.
The acting is OK.
The only thing I don't like about it is it does not have subtitle.
It's worth watching once.",1226534400,4,332,4.741379310344827
