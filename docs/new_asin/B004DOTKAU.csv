4333996,2,B004DOTKAU,"Cheap.  Cost and quality about the same. Nice picture on the DVD case.  Quality looks like someone pressed multiple copies off the original. I got the one that must have been pressed last.
For the price O.K. but I woudn't spend any more.",1315785600,,237,4.488372093023256
4333997,2,B004DOTKAU,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD Set. I bought this set because of the price but now I regret it. This is a bunch of boring documentaries put together, featuring  a bunch of unknown  and not very credible researchers telling us why they think UFOs and Alien Abductions are real. I agree that there's a lot of informations on this documentary, but a lot of the cases are not very credible so what's the point ?? This is a proof that quality is a lot more important than quantity. I am disappointed because usually Mill Creek Entertainment produce good documentaries ( ""America's 60 greatest Unsolved Mysteries and Crimes"", ""Vegas: The city the Mob made"", America's Serial Killers: Portraits in Evil"" ).

Don't waste your money on this DVD. If you want to buy real documentaries about UFOs then buy ""I know what I saw"", ""UFOs: The Best Evidences"" or ""Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs"".",1309478400,10,889,4.72258064516129
4333998,1,B004DOTKAU,"When I bought this,I thought WOW,6 documentaries for that price?!
And it had a spiffy cover.
Oh was I so wrong.
Your probably expecting alot of video footage of UFO's and abductees, from all over the world.
When most of the time,your looking at people talking in a conference room,with very,very,very poor audio,showing slides.
1 documentary is basically one guy,just being interviewed literaly for about an hour,basically babbling about his theories and such.
I own hundreds of UFO documentaries,and have no clue,to even who this guy is.
I found myself basically just fast forwarding most of them to get to anything significant.
The only thing that saves this horrid collection at all,is Travis Walton telling his story in his own words.
And maybe one or two insights that I didn't already know.",1304553600,42,796,5.037878787878788

4334000,4,B004DOTKAU,"Over 12 hours of documentaries and interviews, unfortunately I already had much of it, it contains all of the set ""The Truth about the Philadelphia Experiment"" and all of the ""Reality UFO Series"" and more, the 3 disk set has 2 full length documentary's, lectures or interviews on each disk, the feature length Doc's are titled 1. True Abductions and visitations 2. UFO's Invade the U.S. 3. Alien Encounters and Contactees 4. The Secret UFO Files 5. E.T.'s and Time Travel 6. The U.K. UFO Sightings, it is a great set for the true enthusiast on the subject, but much of the set is just bare bones lectures and interviews, there isn't much as far as glossy production or actual UFO footage, but it is a great set for the true enthusiast, who wants to know more in depth nitty gritty on the subject of UFO's and abductions.",1301011200,15,820,4.547297297297297
4334001,4,B004DOTKAU,"The information about the Philadelphia Experiment from disc 3 was amazing. It is too bad that the man with the sunglasses has some sort of speech impedement, next to impossible to understand, bummer. As well as the people in the audience who would ask stupid questions, the man in the blue sweater was the best, you could understand his speech and he seemed genuine.",1296864000,8,366,4.734375
4334006,1,B004DOTKAU,"Most of it is amateurish recording of a conference, and consists of a series of talking heads. And not very accomplished or skilled talking heads, either. The visuals are unreadable and there is not video of sightings, UFOs, etc. The sound quality is so terrible that much of the blather is indecipherable. There is no editing. And several of the speakers are full-blown idiots.

 The only competent thing in this whole mess is the deceptive cover. Save your money.",1423008000,,465,4.8734177215189876

4334011,1,B004DOTKAU,"Have you ever decided to crank up your stereo while watching a interesting documentary? Me neither. Someone thought it was a good idea to play really crappy music over the interviews. At first I thought it was my neighbors stereo or some advertisement on my laptop. Its really bizarre...and frustrating. You cant hear anything being said. I am sure the documentary is great. However, you cant hear anything they are saying because of the god awful music they constantly play throughout the entire documentary. You think/hope it will stop because you want to hear what is being said. What a terrible waste of a good documentary. I would actually buy this again if they came out with a normal/no music version. Oh well.",1387324800,4,717,4.837398373983739
4334012,1,B004DOTKAU,"I agree with reviewer mistbornblue and others: This is a very poor documentary DVD. Its audio is almost inaudible most of the time, the images are made of very old --mostly blurred-- photos and the reading of some of the documents are unreadable, too small and blurred. I do not recommend anyone on spending a cent on this DVD. It is made out of interviews or conferences which have no relevant information at all.  If you want to see good DVD's, related to the UFO, abductions, ET phenomena, etc, among others,you can see:  UFO The Greatest Story Ever Denied, I Know What I Saw, The Day Before Disclosure. There are other very good ones. This one is not worth your money or your time.",1361491200,3,685,4.516129032258065
4334013,4,B004DOTKAU,"This DVD has a lot of useful information, but it is not an ""entertainment"" movie, so don't bother with this if your only mildly interested in UFOs. My only beef with this DVD is the use of CGI and graphics that have little to do with the topic.  When I see a picture, I'd like to know it is real and not just a CGI image created by the production company.  That said, this is a good purchase for serious viewers.",1355011200,,412,4.074074074074074
4334014,3,B004DOTKAU,Its decent! and its a good deal for 6 documenturies. but on the other hand all of them r kinda corny if u ask me... the best 1 out of all of them is the second movie on the first disc...,1326585600,,186,3.5609756097560976
4334015,3,B004DOTKAU,"This is a massive set of six documentaries.  In one place you get an extensive survey of UFO thinking:

First off is a lengthy lecture from Dr. Roger Leir, who claims to have removed strange objects from 10 people who have been abducted by aliens.

Next is a documentary on the tremendous number of UFO sightings in 1973.  Most amazing and convincing is the unedited, unsolicited tape of two shocked and frightened abductees who were left alone together in a sheriff's office and surreptitiously recorded soon after their traumatic experience.  The first-hand recording of Lt. Colonel Charles Halt (USAF) during his encounter with a UFO over Rendlesham Forest in 1980 is also included.

The third documentary is a lecture by Dr. Richard Boylan on UFO abductions, the fourth is an extensive interview with Nick Pope, another UFO expert.

The fifth documentary is on the Philadelphia Experiment, which is to time-travel what Roswell is to alien visitation.  And finally, there's a documentary on UFO sightings in the UK, which is fascinating stuff for Americans--not all the UFOs show up in the desert Southwest of the US.

Just a great deal of material here to digest and think about.  A great jumping off point for further research if you're fascinated by this sort of thing.",1320796800,2,1275,4.943661971830986
8425788,2,B004DOTKAU,"I would have to agree with the other reviewers concerning this documentary. I, too, was very disappointed in this Mill Creek release.
It's broken up into 3 discs each containing 2 programs. Of the 6 total programs, 4 of them are poorly filmed, inadequate lectures. The only lecture that I found slightly interesting was Travis Walton's (because his abduction case is so well documented) but it was cut short at the end, provided no real insight, and was very difficult to hear. The only program worth noting was the second one on disc one focusing on the year 1973. I found this to be very enlightening, interesting, and well-done. However, it was not enough to save this entire set. Not recommended for the casual viewer. For the alien enthusiast, maybe worth one viewing but not highly recommended.",1523318400,,800,4.846715328467154

8425791,1,B004DOTKAU,"I didn't buy this on Amazon, I got it from Barnes and Noble full price. There is nothing exciting about this. Mostly just conferences that were filmed. If you are looking for something exciting, I don't recommend this.",1475539200,,218,4.7631578947368425

8425794,2,B004DOTKAU,"First...expect Mill Creek packaging of dvds in paper jackets. This 3 dvd set is taken at a Metaphysical Symposium in England in 2003 and it's production leaves A LOT to be desired but, let's move on. 
Disc 1. 'Alien Implants'=Dr. Roger-hard to hear-Leir. Lots of surgical shorts claiming to remove implants. No way to be sure what the heck he's removing or if it's legit. Lecture. Witness as well Travis Walton lecturing about his abduction. 'The UFOs Invade the US""''=The second closest youll come to a visual documentary. Basically 1973 history and a related 'UFO Flap'. Hard to recover from the initial  Nixon portions. I Literally had to shake my head and re-focus but it got a little better.
Disc 2. 'Alien Encounters and Contactees'=Dr Richard Boylans' lecture on Star Children at said symposium. Slideshow. (Almost impossible to read, I take that back....it IS impossible to see.) Some cool pictures but overall...a lecture '+'.
'Secret UFO Files'=Nick Pope and Tim Goode (better to read than hear imho.) and others on a stage w an young lady interviewer interspersed with some CGI clips accompanied by a music track that clenched my jaw at times. To be fair, some cool images and diatribe. The girl was cute. I get the impression this was supposed to be this disc sets' 'main event'. Onward...
Disc 3. Wow. Ive seen some sketchy stuff in this field but the majority of this first one is just talking and baseless cheap film making. 'Black Operations' =A trio that talks about the Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk that are well intentioned (I suppose) but the sunglassed ringleader Preston is so full of st as to be laughable. OMG!&iexcl; is wayyy too small an exclamation. Not sure where they got this 'group' but...holy cow, you really have to stretch your imagination to take it seriously. Good info in some respects regarding the Philadelphia Experiment but clearly the knowledge came from a few books and films cobbled together.  As a viewers sidenote, as this docudrama went on
I found myself listening but asking myself, 'How far are these guys going to spin this tale?' As each spoke it was clear they were major fans of 'The Time Machine', 'The Philadelphia Experiment, ' 'The Time Tunnel' crossed over 'The 'Forbidden Planet' bc the odyssey-story had features of all of them. Gotta hand it to Preston he's a believer in himself. On the one hand he claims to have built the 'time machine' on this tiny island (and other expansive projects) then goes through a slideshow pointing out things and buildings on Montauk Island that he has no idea what they are. The accompanying slideshow mostly looking suspiciously like 3 guys on a wild field 'trip' in 1986 -17 years earlier-that they have fashioned in their minds today as some sort of Dungeons and Dragons meets The Time Machine dream-woven tale for the intentionally gullible. Lets call this one...Creative. Fun just to see how three guys minds together can wax and wane about a story they so wish they witnessed. Maybe I'm wrong. You decide. Almost forgot.
Even more astounding than all of the above is the captive audience in the forum that actually engages these guys. Hard not to describe this offering without sounding critical but hey, Im just relating my impressions. Looking back on it, it may be one of the best episodes in this dvd set.
'UK UFO Sightings'= Nick Pope again in his younger days. Interesting biographical stuff and discussion w a second person whos image fades in and out to his left. Often I believe, to just show affirmation with a shaking head.
I've seen worse but...not by much overall. (Encounters From Another Dimension comes to mind.) Please excuse my punctuation. It's hard to edit on a cellphone.
Worth it for a penny plus shipping.",1455753600,,3735,4.860282574568289
8425795,2,B004DOTKAU,"if you put in disc 1 and hit play, you may have immediate regrets. first title is a poor production quality recording of lectures given at metaphysical conference of some sort, extremely dry and near unwatchable. go on to the other titles. some are interview style recordings of witnesses with supporting still shots. others are older produced content like you might see on TV (more what I would call a documentary). might be some good content in here, but going to have to wade through it to tell",1448582400,,497,4.659090909090909

But, worthless, undocumented, I might as well just say it, crazy stuff.  The quiet guy at the end of the street with the tin-foil hat is going through this for the 126th time, but, don't waste your time on it.  If they shipped it for free, it wouldn't be worth a .01 expense.  On the good side, the DVDs seem to make pretty good coasters.  Sorry guys, you should have let you middle school kids put this together.  You're making any serious study in this area look stupid!  Sorry, hate to be so negative about anything, but don't waste you money.  (Is one more ""sorry"" okay?)!  Dave",1448323200,2,746,4.419117647058823
