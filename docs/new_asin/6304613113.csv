912437,4,6304613113,"The first film was an eye-opener as far as the transition from comics to big screen was concerned. Being a true take on the then new Dark Knight series of comics that treated its readers to a more mature and brooding Batman, giving them strong, well thought out stories with a more adult theme.  This was (in my opinion) due to the influence of the up and coming Manga trend surfacing in the west with the hugely popular Akira film.  Burton and Keaton created, on the screen, a Dark hero for the 90's that the fans of the comics could relate to and it worked BIG time marrying stark visuals with a music score as rich as you could fit on any film. For a home cinema owner there is little better out there to show off your systems capability than with than this film.  As with most sequels the second, Batman Returns, was less than the original, in this case suffering from too many characters/stars all demanding a piece of the screen time, why on earth the studios think that more is better is beyond me. Quality is ALWAYS better than quantity in a film as born out in many sequels vs. originals. That is not to say that this was a poor film, far from it, just not as good as the first. There were too many character origins to make the main plot anything other than passable.  Now, onto the third in the series. A new director will always bring with them a new vision of a character and story and Schumacher is no different, I believe another reviewer had the same thoughts as me on this one 'The Dark Knight in Technicolor'. For fans of the first two films this had to be a bit of a shock, new Batman and a real glossy comic book feel to the film. This was good escapism but lacked the mature approach of the first two films.  Oh dear, with the final outing, Batman Forever, we see where Schumacher got his inspiration, not from the comics, not from the first films, oh no, anyone remember the campy, hammy Batman TV series with Burt Ward I believe?? Yup the only thing missing from this film were tights and the visual sound affects. POW BASH KA-BLAMMY.  I strongly feel that the stars were wasted on this film, which is a great pity as there is far more potential to this series than has been shown thus far.  In summery, the first two films are ideal teen upward viewing, the second two are in my opinion squarely aimed at kids. A good all round family package I guess.",972777600,,2375,4.311659192825112
912438,3,6304613113,"I can personally say that I am a big fan of Batman and Batman Returns.  I find these two Tim Burton films as wonderful pieces of pop cinema.  In,  Batman it doesnt go for camp and trys to take the Batman legend seriously.  Batman Returns goes even further, and explores the characters of Catwoman  and Batman.  It's hard to find that in commercial film.  As for Batman  Forever, it rates a C+.  There's plenty of eye candy, but not much else.  It is however a good popcorn muncher.  Batman & Robin is pretty bad,  but not as bad as some people think.  I do wish it was on Mystery Science  Theatre, though. This box set doesn't contain any new extras. All it is is  the ones released a few years ago with just production notes.  Buy the  first two seperatly, but if you're patient just remember there will  probably be special edition versions in a few years.",966124800,2,858,4.356687898089172
912439,3,6304613113,"If nothing else the tragedy of the Batman Movie Franchise proves that Nothing is Director Proof. The first 2 films Batman and Batman Returns are successful because Tim Burton creates an Environment where these Characters  can exist and not look out of place(something he has done brilliantly in  all his films. He is the master of context).Keaton, despite the controversy  over his casting, is the perfect Batman for the simple reason that he looks  like he enjoys inflicting punishment. Then comes Joel Schumacher and the  Neon Machine Guns and Dayglo Street Punks. The line that sums up both Batman  Forever and Batman and Robin is Jim Carrey's ""Was that over the top? I  just can't tell anymore!"" One would think that out of the tens of  millions of dollars invested in these films some of it might find its way  to a Screenwriter. And if there was a Worse movie than Batman and Robin in  the last 5 years, I didn't see it...It is so bad that it killed a  potentially great series...And how George Clooney still manages to do that  neck thing he does, in the rubber cowl, is beyond me...Oh well, as I've  always maintained, any 3 episodes of the Animated Series are better than  any of the Movies...Ask your kids.",946771200,,1216,4.647887323943662

912979,5,6304613113,"I honestly had no idea what I was in for when I got this, I was a baby when these came out lol. I thought they were going to be serious and edgy like the recent Batman movies but these are the complete opposite. It's not quite as cliche as Adam West's Batman it still doesn't take itself that seriously cuz again, this is about a guy who dresses up like a bat every night. I love all of these and I was laughing every 5 minutes. I can't even pick a favorite movie or villain portrayal or Batman portrayal because they are all so fantastic in their own unique way. I personally consider these more as comedies, but they were so enjoyable that I actually prefer these movies over the recent (bat)ch of Batman movies because I just had so much fun. I like that they included Robin in the last two movies and he was pretty cute too.

 The only thing I don't like about these movies is that there's a different girlfriend in each one of them except for Batman & Robin where the main women in that one don't end up with men.",1485388800,,1018,4.16243654822335

But as a young kid my parents only allowed me to watch Tim burtons movies (batman 1989 and batman returns) which I absolutely enjoy. The graphics are outdated but it's a classic. I was also allowed to watch Joel  shuemauchers movies (batman forever and batman and robin) and I have to say as a kid I enjoyed this movies but now I really don't. Batman forever is better than batman and robin but it still doesn't feel like batman. And don't even get me started on batman and robin because that movie is atrocious. The villains suck and geoge clooney didn't play a good batman. Plus the dialogue and plot is one of the worst ever written. It's a good kids film... I guess:/ but not very entertaining for adults.

The main criticism that I have of this set is how the discs are placed in this set.  Its like this set was only supposed to have two discs but in the two slots they economically put the movies on top of each other, two in each slot. Yes these are blu ray discs so they have an extra coating of protection on them but still definitely would have appreciated extra slots for the movies.  But for the money its a good economy set of the original Batman motion picture franchise.",1462579200,,673,4.2015503875969

913527,4,6304613113,"Apparently Bruce Wayne is a man of many identities and faces. I got this at Rasputin Records for 15 bucks and I gotta say it was a steal. Batman (1989) is great Michael Keaton was really born for the role. Jack Nicholson plays an amazing scary Joker. Batman Returns is great as well, Danny DeVito's penguin is as ugly as he is terrifying. Michelle Pfeffier is a pretty cool catwoman albeit a bit sexualized, and Michael Keaton is back too, and he is so far to date (2016)after watching this my first time this weekend my favorite Batman. Batman Forever takes a different turn, as it is directed by Joel Schmalker instead of Tim Burton and has a very campy feel but I can't imagine anyone else being The Riddler besides Jim Carrey, even if he is just playing Jim Carrey.  You get Val Kilmer as the generic store bought Batman, but he fills the role and still someone you root for. Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is just atrocious. He is truly not meant for the role at all and is so boring compared to Carrey's Riddler. Then you get to the steaming turd, Batman and Robin. Regarded as one of the worst movies of all time you have Uma Thurman's wanna be catwoman in Poison Ivy, who is just irritating, and you have Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I assume was the time of his life as Mr. Freeze, his ice puns hit about 1000 half way through the movie and it just is awful. George Clooney is Batman but really he is just George Clooney in a rubber suit. But the bright side is that it is so bad, it's hilariously fun to watch with friends. These movies came out from 1989-1997 and you can tell with the effects but it really isn't a bad thing. This was when a comic book superhero movie felt like a comic book and didn't need to be real world. These movies even Batman and Robin all have a fun side to them and are very enjoyable. There are no special features, which I don't mind as bought it for the movies. You get two discs that just have the titles of the movies on the inner circle of the discs, a bit disappointing but for the price and the amount of movies, I don't mind. The best order to watch these films in are the following. Batman (1989) so you get the amazing Keaton/Nicholson duo to suck you into Gotham. Then watch Batman and Robin (1997) so you can see how awful a batman film could be, but also have a few laughs at how bad it is. Then watch Batman Forever to see Jim Carrey's great Riddler, and how you got Robin from Batman and Robin, Chris O Donnell is a terrible Robin but he is actually OK in Batman Forever. Then watch Batman Returns, but really for the viewer it's Michael Keaton returns, as you get a big breath of relief to see the best batman of all back in action again. It being the 4 film series to a nice close even though it was technically the 2nd film. If you are expecting a dark Batman like the Nolan trilogy, you will not find it here. Keaton's Batman is a real honest person who is actually just crazy enough to be believed that he would go dress up as a bat. If you find this collection for 15$ or anything less and are a batman fan or even a just a film fan. Do not hesitate, buy this collection, and put your Batmobile in drive. You are in for a crazy weekend in Gotham.",1459555200,2,3203,4.208130081300813

2 of the worst,
would've rather had just a double feature with just Batman and Batman Returns,

Tim Burton got it right,
dark, mysterious, brooding,
Jack Nicholson as the Joker was an iconic performance,
Michelle Pfeiffer was a pur-fect Catwoman!,

Joel Schumacher got it wrong in every way possible,
wild, neon colors, accessories like a Batman credit card (WTF!?)
the ONLY good thing about Batman Forever was Val Kilmer's voice for the role of Bruce Wayne /Batman,
Tommy Lee Jones's hammy performance and make-up as Two-Face were just ridiculous,
Batman And Robin NEVER should have happened!

914169,5,6304613113,"If you're stuck in the Nolan-trilogy's universe, you probably won't be too interested in these. You can't go into them with that style in mind. None of them are very serious, but all four are entertaining. They all retain relics of Batman's campy silliness; some more than others. And I mean, come on, it's four Batman movies for under $10! What else were you gonna spend that on? The Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy? You better not. You better not even consider that.

Now for really brief reviews of each individual movie.

Batman
Michael Keaton? Instant, ""Yes."" He plays a better Bruce Wayne than he does Batman.
Jack Nicholson's Joker was cut from a different cloth than Ledger's. But that in no way takes away from it. He did a great job.
Cool atmosphere and set design, decent plot, and good cast.

Batman Return
Keaton reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
He's joined by Danny Devito, who plays a  good but somewhat off-putting Penguin.
Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman. She was, uh...well-suited for the film. Crappy sexist puns aside, she played the role well.
There's some Christopher Walken sprinkled in there, too.
Not as good as Batman, but worth watching.

Batman Forever
Let's get the disclaimer out of the way: Val Kilmer is my favorite live-action iteration.
Kilmer's Bruce Wayne is pretty spot on. His Batman is great. Solid suit, gadgets galore, corny one-liners, cool lair and batmobile. Plus the world's greatest detective actually does detective when Kilmer plays him.
That said, the rest of the movie has an abundance of cheesiness,
Jim Carrey's Riddler and Tommy Le Jones' Two-Face are likable. But lord are they stupid. Terrible, terrible supervillains.
Nicole Kidman plays a pretty shallow Chase Meridian. But Batman doesn't have time to spare for emotional depth. Thankfully.
And Chris O'Donnell's Robin is alright, though his backstory falls short.
Batman Forever is something you could watch with your kids and enjoy. The ""Holy rusted metal"" line was perfect.
Or alone in your room while eating an entire package of Oreos. Sobbing.

Batman & Robin
This movie catches a lot of flack. A LOT of flack. George Clooney, Mr. Freeze, nipples. I'm sure you've heard it all. And for the most part, it's true.
So if you plan on watching this, go in expecting a fairly dumb plot filled with more holes than a termite's dinner table and a cast of goofy, thick-headed heroes and villains.
Clooney as Batman was...probably a mistake. I don't think he deserves the raw hatred some people express for his role. But he doesn't deserve praise for it either.
O'Donnell returns as Robin. Better in this one than in Batman Forever.
Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl was totally unnecessary. It didn't even make sense.
Poison Ivy, portrayed by Uma Therman, was filled with terrible lines and hypnotic movement.
Her partner was Bane. No clue who played him. That actor is probably still trying to forget his time on-set. Bane was just awful. Like a mentally retarded gorilla dressed up as a luchador.
Arnold as Mr. Freeze may be the best example of ""so bad it's good"" in cinematic history. So many puns. The costume and his plans were over-the-top. His minions were even dumber.
A lot of you might skip this one. Maybe you should.
But you shouldn't.
Just watch it.
Watch them all.
In one sitting.
Eating a package of Oreos.

Seen all four of these movies?  So what if the same guy isn't wearing the Batman suit.  Can you name the three actors who play Batman in the four movies?

Well regardless of who's in the Batman suit .,, these movies are still good Bat entertainment.  :)  The Four Movies in this package are the original and somewhat recent FOUR BATMAN MOVIES,, separate from the earlier ones- known for the Sock n  Bang n Boom which WAS close to being the cartoon Batman....but it was still Batman right?  LIKE THEM - YES  Enough to buy the Blu Ray Discs ...  Today it means sometimes renting  first,,,  then decide to buy or not.  Personally have seen ALL of these movies before.. now I own the set.

PS: The newest Batman movies are THE TRILOGY produced by Christopher Nolan and in the Batman suit is Christian Bale who does a  standout modern version of the Batman Saga.  Also own in BluRay",1427241600,,1050,4.465608465608466

914633,5,6304613113,"I picked this up during around Christmas 2014 when I saw the price at $22.99 which was too great a bargain to refuse (although it dropped down to $19.99 a week later, grrrrrr). I was a little concerned at first because this seemed to be UK import region free Blu ray. It is indeed Warner Bros UK import product. They all played perfectly fine on my Sony Blu ray player. I especially appreciated the fact that it doesn't have any preview trailers that you have to skip through; the movies begin without having to select play.

I think all four movies are equally entertaining. Some people rate Batman Forever and Batman and Robin poorly although I do not quite agree with such low ratings. It is true that Batman and Robin is probably the weakest movie in the set however, I think it is still entertaining and I appreciate the old-school special effects. They built actual sets and used props (instead of using blue screen/CGI effects which, sadly, is the norm today). I think George Clooney was definitely the worst choice to play Batman. He did not reflect the aura of Batman whatsoever; he was just George Clooney. Chris O'Donnell was OK as Robin. Alicia Silverstone was gorgeous and I think she played her part well. I have found Batman Forever to be much better than the poor reviews indicated. I think Val Kilmer was great as Batman. I may even go so far as to say that he may be better than Michael Keaton although Michael Keaton was awesome as Batman. Batman Forever has two classic super-vilains The Riddler (Jim Carrey) and two-face Harvery (Tommy Lee Jones) plus Uma Thurman as earth-woman. Batman Forever is probably my favorite movie in the set although not by much. The first movie, Batman, is also a great film starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I hadn't seen this movie for a long time and I must have forgotten how sexy and gorgeous Kim Basinger was back in the day. She was absolutely hot (and people say Angeline Jolie is sexy). Batman Returns is also an entertaining film and my favorite part is Michelle Pfeiffer playing catwoman. I didn't like the Penguin Man played by Danny Devito which appeared to be more gruesome and ugly than a villain.

There are tons of extras on all movies, including commentaries by directors. I definitely recommend this box set to all Batman fans. I know there are a lot discussions among the fans comparin these movies to Christoper Nolan's recent trilogy. I do like Christopher Nolan's movies; they are great films. However, I also think these movies are also great in their own way and they may not be as necessarily as dark as Nolan's films, they convey the comic book feeling better.",1421193600,3,2641,4.653104925053533

914696,5,6304613113,"As a kid I loved Batman and still do to this day. I always loved watching these films, when I was little I would imagine I was Batman. To me three out of the four movies are great.

Batman 1989 5/5
The first Batman, this movie is great. All around great acting by all involved with this movie. Tim Burton did a really great job directing and producing this film. All around great.

Batman Returnes 1992 5/5
The second of the four, this movie has a darker side to it then the first. With actions like steeling children and then drowning them, plotted by the Penguin and lets not forget Catwoman electrocuting Max Shreck. As always great acting by all and great work by those working behind the sense.

Batman Forever 1995 4/5
The third out of four, this movie is good, I think it could have been better had Tim Burton stayed as director and producer. The film would have done much better with the story he could have come up with and characters casting would have better as well. Good movie though.

Batman & Robin 1997 1/5
The final Batman movie in this collection. This movie was very strange. To start off the acting was not good at all and Clooney playing the part as batman??? Not the one who should have played Batman, they could have found someone better. Batgirl as Alfred`s niece?? I don`t understand that one at all.

915090,1,6304613113,"earlier this month saw (finally!!) the long overdue dvd release of the original Batman tv series, starring Adam West. it was such an exciting turn of events that it prompted me to look into the more recent movies, and for doing so i must semi-refute certain statements. i pointed out that the ""dark knight"" version of Batman is, basically, a rip-off of The Shadow (right down to the millionaire playboy secret identity!), and argued that the '60s tv series is the best version because it's the only one where Batman manages to get out of The Shadow's, well, shadow and become something unique in his own right. that much i still stand by.
but i was mistaken in the implication that the character is completely worthless on that basis...at least in the case of Christopher Nolan's breathtaking Dark Knight films. that trilogy is a truly gripping as well as visceral cinematic tour-de-force, and i kick myself for being closed-minded enough just dismiss it up to this point. (well, better late than never.)
when it came to it's predecessor franchise, however, i was even righter than i realized. the principle difference is that these films don't try to stir any psychological ramifications. take the murder of seven-year-old Bruce Wayne's parents that got the ball rolling. where Nolan's film introduces us to the parents before seeing them gunned down, and then accompanies young Bruce on his journey to come to terms with the tragedy, the Tim Burton film just sort of finally gets around to mentioning it in passing.
what this films instead opt to be is ""popcorn movies,"" mindless escapism for mindless escapism's sake. maybe there's nothing wrong with that per se, but it certainly weakens them in the wake of Nolan's more psychological approach.
only the most obvious unfortunate side-effect of Nolan's epic treatment: these films, the first in particular, have a once perhaps imperceptible but now positively glaring ""backlot"" feel.
casting in particular is a mixed bag in these films. the choice of Michael Keaton for the lead remains one of cinema's all-time great ""huh?"" decisions. Keaton is a fine actor, in fact a pretty damn good actor, in his place, but this just ain't the place. his Batman is woefully soft, and his Bruce Wayne is an absentminded nerd. the infamous casting of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in the Conqueror was positively inspired by comparison.
of course the real star the first time around was Jack Nicholson as The Joker. again, impressive at the time, but now that Nicholson has been out-Joker'd by Heath Ledger, not so much. in fact, for all the further sophistication it supposedly represented, Nicholson now comes off as almost exactly the sort of camp goofball the character was present as in the '60s. he's literally only a mustache under the makeup away from Cesar Romero.
the bottom of this particular barrel - unquestionably the worst Batman film (and arguably worst superhero film) ever likely to be made - is the truly execrable Batman Returns. it's basic concept of merging carnivals and politics is amusing in theory but so awkward in practice as to completely defeat the potential satire element. this dreadful film could not of cast the ""Caped Crusader"" in a less flattering light if it had been directed by The Joker.
it further suffers from flimsy villains, not least of which the single goofiest antagonist in comic-book history: any actor other than Burgess Meredith who thinks he could play The Penguin (or would want to anyway) needs, at the very least, psychiatric help. basically a short fellow in a tuxedo (or ""penguin suit"") with a funny waddle-type walk, the character is a one-note joke, and an only mildly amusing one at that. it's hard to say what's harder to believe: that he stems from the grittier comics rather than the whimsical Adam West series, that he's lasted so long in those comics, or that Burgess Meredith actually found enough personality therein to make him one of the shining stars of the aforementioned series.
in all fairness, the inherent flimsiness of the character was recognized and an attempt was made to flesh him out. however, the ludicrous backstory they came up with about growing up in the sewer only serves to make the already iffy character even hokier. and since Danny DeVito plays him in full Louie De Palma mode, he's really not so much menacing as obnoxious.
nice as it would be to think that the exponentially stronger character of Catwoman was here to pick up the slack, she doesn't really. for some reason, Michelle Pfeiffer saw her not so much as a sultry femme-fatale as a hoity-toity snob.
so the only genuinely intimidating character here is a cookie-cutter, not to mention peripheral, corrupt businessman played by Christopher Walken, and as usual, the crux of his villainy is pretty much being Christopher Walken.
to say nothing of the fact that Keaton was retained in spite of having proved hopelessly inadequate. he sort of works in the first film, where his role was that of Jack Nicholson's straight man, but alas, Returns demonstrates all too vividly what we discerning viewers already suspected: Keaton's Batman without Nicholson's Joker is like Abbott without Costello.
what's truly surreal about this series is that, with a goose-egg like Batman Returns staring us in the face, the absolutely nadir not simply of this franchise but the superhero subgenre itself, is officially cited as the last installment. certainly Batman & Robin is a film with more than it's share of drawbacks: there's it's disinclination to try anything new with the formula, for instance, and it's own feeble excuses for villains. (Uma Thurman is neither sexy or formidable enough to make Poison Ivy all that she should be.) to say nothing of attempted witticisms so strained not even Groucho Marx or Steve Martin could've made 'em funny. (""a laundry service that delivers,"" ""never leave the cave without your bat-credit card."") oh yes, there's also the matter of our would-be hero being played by that most overrated of modern actors (not to mention poster-child of Hollywood nepotism), George Clooney.
so no, Batman & Robin ain't no Casablanca either, but nonetheless the crime just doesn't fit the punishment. because Batman Returns makes Batman & Robin look like Bride Of Frankenstein, The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, and The Lord Of The Ring: The Return Of The King ALL ROLLED INTO ONE!!! why Joel Schumacher was forced to apologize for the latter but Tim Burton gets off scot-free for the former, God alone can say.
for what it's worth, the best of these films is no. 3, Batman Forever. for one thing, Val Kilmer is easily the best of the three Batmans (Batmen) herein. (that more than anything else is why Schwarzenegger and Thurman were so underwhelming: the real villain here is whichever idiot bureaucrat fired Kilmer!) the long overdue introduction of Robin doesn't hurt either. and it features the best villains in the franchise: some have accused Tommy Lee Jones, in portrayal of Two-Face, of liberally appropriating the manic energy employed by Nicholson in the first film, but this is excusable because Jones turned out to be much better at it.
my very favorite of Batman's nemeses is probably The Riddler, although it's a bummer that it had to be Jim Carrey. the part was designed with Robin Williams in mind - i can still vividly remember a tv interview where he discussed it at the time - before the Powers That Be decided that then up-&-comer Carrey would be the ""hipper"" choice. and since he seemed to have a similar style - Carrey was already being called the Robin Williams of his generation - the switch could be made without too much fuss.
(interestingly, one of the tidbits to surface in light of Williams' recent suicide has it that he came within the same hairsbreadth of being The Joker...both times.)
but alas, what is it worth, really? being the best installment of this chaotic franchise is roughly equivalent to being the best musician in a ""boy band.""
in short, i was wrong, but only up to a point. don't waste your time with these train wrecks. it is Nolan's masterworks that demonstrate just what it is that i was wrong about.",1417046400,,8161,4.901663051337672

915187,4,6304613113,"Batman pretty much said that comics to films could work, and so...

Batman: I gotta be honest, I didn't care much for the film all those years ago. I enjoyed it but thought it was weird, not campy weird like the Adam West films and series... just odd. Jack Nicholson played an awesome version of the Joker and although I thought Keaton was a little too short to play Batman, he was pretty alright.

Batman Returns: I enjoyed this film immensely... Michelle Pfeiffer was perfect as Catwoman. Danny DeVito was also enjoyably weird as the Penquin. Sure, there are still the odd elements but its hard to get away from that with Tim Burton at the helm. I have no idea who was complaining about the darker elements, Batman is supposed to be darker in tone. I guess those who grew up on the Adam West serials were the majority at the time...

Anyway, looking back on both these film its really interesting to notice that they had such a distinct feel and look about them... I enjoyed seeing them again and really feeling that a third film under Burton would have been a wonderful way to cap it off.

So.. this leads me to the rest. The driftwood of the bunch...

Batman Forever: The only good thing from this film is the inclusion of Robin played by Chris O'Donnell. That is it... everything else felt like the Adam West films only with a bigger budget and lots of shots of rubber nipples, butts and crotches.

Batman & Robin: Even viewing it recently, its like grinding your teeth down to the root.
The film is ugly... neon, overdone and just plain silly that anyone viewing it is probably losing an IQ or two.

Anyway, enjoy or not! :)",1414972800,2,1630,4.449664429530201

In it,he is faced against his nemesis,Joker.

*Batman Returns - It is the sequel of the film,Batman. In it,Batman is up against a number of villains namely: Max Shreck,a megalomaniac business tycoon;the deformed and deranged Penguin; and Catwoman,a wronged secretary with mixed motives regarding the Dark Knight. They all team up together to  to divvy up their ill-gotten gains and help discredit the masked caped crusader.

*Batman Forever - It features our masked caped crusader go against the villains - The Riddler,Two-Face and Penguin - with the allegiance from a love interest, Dr. Chase Meridian and a young, orphaned circus acrobat named Dick Grayson,who becomes his sidekick Robin.

Immediately after receiving and opening this set, I came across a Blu-Ray set at Costco for $15.
Haven't watched all of them to comment on quality across the board, but I'm not very picky with that anyway.

It was great to see the original Batman movies cleaned up in the Blu-Ray format. Like many people I was a fan of the first two Tim Burton & Michael Keaton movies (Batman, Batman Returns).  You can't beat the price though to include the later 2 Joel Schumacher films as well.
Tons of in-depth special features are included for each movie. It appears that all of the DVD special features are included on the Blu-ray set.

916015,3,6304613113,"Pros:  Batman.

Cons:  Batman and Robin.

Thoughts:  When I first heard that Tim Burton was doing a live-action Batman movie, I wasn't too thrilled.  I had grown up on the Adam West show and the Superfriends cartoons, and I didn't take the character seriously.  Especially when Prince (or is it ""Artist Formerly Known As""?) released his own soundtrack.

But what Burton gave us was a take on the character only longtime fans of the comic could appreciate, until this film.

As for me, I appreciate what the first film in this series did in reviving the character.

Unfortunately, as the movies progressed, they tended to get sillier and sillier.  Although lots of people still like Batman Returns, to me, that's where it went downhill.  And the Schumacher films continued that trend until it ended with Batman and Robin.  It became less about giving us good stories and serious characters, and more about squeezing in as many celebrities as possible.

Still, the Danny Elfman soundtrack is fantastic - dark and mysterious, yet heroic and triumphant.

If you're a fan of the Dark Knight, these films are worth having for their historic significance, if nothing else.  And who knows?  Maybe you'll enjoy the Adam West-style campiness of the later films.",1391385600,,1251,4.9375
916016,2,6304613113,The movies are great and very good quality. The problem with this set is that the case itself is a two disc case.

That's it. Four discs. In a 2-disc case. Why, Warner, why??

As far as BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS, all the extras from the two-disc Special Editions are here. Unfortunately, Warner couldn't care less about the quality of the transfers. Sure you can see more detail in these BD releases, but there's been no restoration. Matte lines are starting to show, and in the case of BATMAN, very clear sprocket hole wear in the master print results in the main title jumping considerably. Paired with Danny Elfman's soaring crescendo when the title appears, the crisp gold title jittering about is pretty disappointing.

I only bought this for the first two (Tim Burton) films, and at Costco the price was less than the two as individual releases. So no great loss, but still another poor customer experience from Warner Bros.",1389484800,89,1017,4.734463276836158

916096,5,6304613113,"Batman is in my opinion the best Batman movie of all-time. Tim Burton absolutely got what Batman is all about better than anybody, including Nolan. His Batman is very dark, and yet still lots of fun. The number one problem I have with Nolan's movies are his lack of fun. The number one reason I go to movies is to have fun. Burton's Gotham City is very Gothic and yet it feels like fantasy. I absolutely love this and I wish Nolan would have understood this, instead Nolan chose to just turn Gotham City into Chicago which I can't stand. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker is the best of all-time, as is Michael Keaton's Batman. Those two performances are what really makes this the best Batman movie of all-time.

Batman Returns is in my opinion what every other movie sequel that has ever been made wishes it could be. It is absolutely the perfect sequel. The movie is so good I think its as good as Batman, its not better, but its equal. This is what makes it perfect. Danny DeVito's Penguin is so perfect and dark, creepy and very disturbing that he feels so authentic to Burton's Gotham City. And Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman really steals this movie, she is so great.

Batman Forever is personally though my favorite Batman movie of all-time. Now your thinking that I just said ""Batman is the best Batman movie of all-time"". Yes, Batman is the best Batman movie of all-time, but Batman Forever is my favorite. The reason I love Batman Forever so much comes down to two things, the first one is I love going to movies and having fun, Batman Forever is in my opinion the most fun of all the Batman movies. The second reason I love Batman Forever so much is just a very personal nostalgic feeling I get from the movie. You can argue with me all you want that Batman Forever isn't that good, but to me nothing you can say will matter because Batman Forever holds a very special place in  my heart.

Now onto Batman & Robin. The movie that is bashed by fanboys all over the internet as the worst Batman movie of all-time. I disagree with all of them mainly because even with all of its flaws Batman & Robin is still loads of fun, and its like a rollercoaster ride with over-the-top acting, great action, and very amazing visuals. You can say what you want that Batman is supposed to be dark and I agree with that for the most part, but what almost all of the fanboys block out of their minds is that there is 75 years of Batman comics, not just the Frank Miller ones. There is a Batman time period that was very fantastical and this movie captures this perfectly. Its not my favorite Batman movie by any means, but it is fun and that's why I like it.

The blu-rays themselves that are in this set are fully loaded with special features that will keep you occupied for hours and hours. There are great documentaries that take you through the history of Batman as well as documentaries for each films as well as tons of other materials.

Then there is 'Batman Forever' (1995) with Val Kilmer as Batman, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, Jim Carrey as the Riddler and this is the first time we have Chris O'Donnell as Robin.

916332,5,6304613113,"Batman has developed a lengthy lineage in the cinematic world. From the grotesqueries of Tim Burton's mind to the performance-geated Schumacher productions, they're a diverse class of entities as unique as the times that they take place in. Now, in the reign of Christopher Nolan's masterful Batman pictures, do they hold up? Two do, two don't.

 It all boils down to this: Batman and Batman Returns are two very artful, thematically rich and gripping renditions of the Dark Knight, while Batman Forever only satisfies on a surface-level, make-your-eyes-bleed kind of way -- and Batman and Robin to an even lesser degree. They're all entertaining on some very mild level, though Burton's pictures are the only two that'll provide enough thought to match up with the modern-minded Batman aficionados. Schumacher's riffs on the series claim to hark back to the '50s and '60s comics while paying homage to the Adam West television show, which you can take as a reasonable explanation or not for their boisterous, obnoxious kid-geared demeanor. Overall, I'd still recommend the whole-shebang as a slate of interesting achievements in production design, action choreography, and cinematography across the board, giving Burton's pictures exceedingly high marks while relegating Schumacher's pictures to rent-worthy diversions, the latter being one perfect for rifftracking with friends.

Speaking on quality alone without price necessarily in mind, The Batman Blu-ray Anthology comes with a firm Recommendation based on the strong visual and aural qualities matching the complete carry-over of the standard-definition box's slate of supplements. As a Batman lover it's certainly a blast to see all of these pictures presented in beautifully-rendered visual transfers and sounding nearly as good as they did in the theaters -- even if they now play second banana (or third, or fourth) to the new breed of Batman movies.",1379289600,3,1912,5.409395973154362

They are not the overdone, over the top redos we have been subjected to since.

Buy this collection. It's almost as valuable as some Star Wars boxsets and much better than the Dark Knight trilogy boxset which offers 25% of the bonus material that this collection offers (though I admit the Dark Knight films are terrific and more accessible for some fans). My only complaints are that there is nothing new for the Blu-Ray release for fans who already own the DVD box set (aside from one digital copy). This is also one of the priciest sets for 4 films I have reviewed (but easily worth the money). Admittedly, it is loaded with bonus supplements and has held its value. It is rumored that the Batman directors are working on additional commentaries, restoring deleted scenes and releasing director's cuts in future releases.

916819,5,6304613113,"Comic book characters are flamboyant, larger-than-life 'fictional' characters that are usually served best when handled that way. Hence my preference for Burton's vision of Batman over the superficial reality of Nolan's vision. Don't get me wrong though, because Christopher Nolan's movies are high quality sophisticated masterpieces, for sure. But in reality Batman would be a short lived joke, the guy would probably end up dead within a month, if not sooner.

Batman is not super-human, so I can't buy into Nolan's Batman anymore than I can Burton's. The difference being that I'm having more fun watching Burton's theatrical fantasy version, over Nolan's pseudo crime/super hero realism. Watching Batman and his crazy costumed friends running around Chicago, as opposed to Burton's beautifully realized Gotham City for example, is just one of the many reasons why I wasn't able to lose myself in Christopher's vision.

But the biggest problem by far, is that the handling and portrayal of the character, betrays an underlying embarrassment of the source material... And with that out of the way, read on for a quick break-down of this cool Blu-ray box set.

This box set contains beautiful transfers of all four films, the inky black palettes of Batman and Batman Returns are sublime, as are the vivid neon palettes of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.

But be warned - Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns are dripping in black and will make a mockery of your LED/LCD screen if it isn't set up right i.e. perfectly. But even then, to truly enjoy the picture as it was intended, a quality plasma screen is absolutely essential.

The audio is excellent and presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 with optional Dolby 5.1 for evening viewing (very nice). But it is not truly dynamic enough, especially Schumacher's films, which is rather disappointing since I'm pretty sure Batman Forever ushered in the 5.1 digital audio age. On a very big plus note though, the spoken dialogue is crisp and clean throughout, something that very often gets overlooked unfortunately.

The extras are worthy, even though there's nothing new over the previous DVD releases, and the packaging is nice too.

As for the films themselves? Well, each to their own. For me Batman Returns is still my all time favorite Batman film, it has beautiful sets, gorgeous art design, expertly crafted characters and superb costumes with a quality script delivered perfectly by all involved that make this film the clear winner for me. A close second is the original 1989 Batman followed by the bad, but kinda fun & flamboyant Batman Forever.

Batman & Robin gets it's own paragraph here, because it is a nasty movie that at certain points becomes painful to watch, this one really hurts the franchise. The third act is especially atrocious and just plain woeful, hence this movie easily falls into fourth place. Having said all that, Batman & Robin is the best one for kids, probably (hopefully) because it's intentionally a kid's movie, so it does have it's purpose. It's just a shame that Mr Freeze was wasted on this title.

SUMMARY

Video: 9/10 - I'm really splitting hairs here...the picture quality isn't up there with other older titles released on Blu-ray, like Blade Runner for example. Even so, the movies are still gorgeous regardless of my less than perfect score.

Audio: 8/10 - Not truly dynamic enough, still excellent, just not reference quality, close though.

Extra content: 8/10 - I'd have given this score a 10/10 if these extras were more than just carry overs from the previous DVD releases of these films. Excellent otherwise.

Tim Burton's genre defining classics and Joel Schumacher's fun romps are a must buy here, yes, even Batman and Robin. And if you've never experienced Batman before Christopher Nolan's take on the character, this is the ideal place for the main course. The A/V improvements of this Blu-ray set over the DVD set are enough to warrant the purchase, just don't pay more than the RRP because I'm guessing it won't be long before Warner Bros re-releases this set.",1363478400,7,4069,4.98377581120944

The many actors who have played Batman are great actors in their own right and bring a new life to the comic book character.  Some of these movies will be remembered; some may not.  But each movie in this Anthology brings new life to Batman in ways sometimes the comic book cannot.

Danny Devito's steller performance as the love deprived mutant ""Penguin"" man, Certainly creeped me out as a kid and conitnues to make me cringe as an adult. Jack Nicholson does a great deranged two face with comical villianism coming out of his ears. And NO ONE plays cat womman like Michelle Pfeiffer

While I won't discuss the film plots and details, I would just like to voice my own opinion on these 4 films. Batman, and Batman Returns stand out as the darkest and most ambitious of the 4 films. My personal favorite of any Batman film is Batman Returns. Mostly because The Penguin is my all time favorite Batman villain
(who can argue against penguins with rockets strapped to them?), and has the best Catwoman. That 2004 atrocity doesn't exist in my book. But don't get me wrong, the first film has the best Joker to date. Yes I prefer the Nicholson Joker over Ledger Joker only because the Dark Knight Joker seemed way to dark and violent, and instead of crazy and fun. But back the the anthology films. While Batman Forever and Batman & Robin are not the worst of films in terms of quality, they completely fail in capturing the true darkness of Batman. They almost seem to poke fun at the first 2 films. But to the average moviegoer and not much of a Batman fan, they are enjoyable.
The discs themselves and the packaging are superb. Very cool case and actually having the movies and bonus material discs in their own respective cases makes it hard to damage the discs. This is the perfect set for any Batman fan, despite having 2 out of the 4 films actually worth watching, I will still give the set 5 stars.

That's one period that I wish I could go back to. I still have 2 toy Batmobiles, a toy Batwing, a model Batwing, and a couple of posters. I even have the comic adaptation and novel as well as the trading cards. The first Batman movie, as well as the second, Batman Returns, is what Batman is supposed to be. Don't pay any attention to Batman Begins and Dark Knight. They're nothing compared to the Michael Keaton films. They're dark, but not too dark. They're really fun and Jack Nicholson as the Joker is pure creepy perfection. I can't think of anything bad about these movies....well, the first two movies, anyway. The music is outstanding. The theme was even used as the opening and closing theme music for the animated series.",1318032000,3,900,4.561728395061729

In searching for the DVD version's, I came across this beautiful piece of work.  I didn't even know they had come out with 2-disc special editions for the films.  So far, I have only watched the original Batman film with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson and all of the special features.  Really took me back to when this film first came out and what a treat to see how they made the film and everything involved.  I would have normally waited to write a review for this product after watching everything, but I know it is only going to get better.  Of course, my favorites of these films is ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"" and ""Batman Forever"".  I never really enjoyed ""Batman & Robin"", but if you want to complete your collection, I highly recommend this box set.  Or you could always just buy your favorite Batman films separately.  The special features are worth the money and we really ain't talking big money for this box set.  I don't really know what this box set was originally when it first came out, but like I stated earlier, I was under aware they had released it.

Although I grew up watching this Batman Anthology and I always loved watching it as a kid even now on BluRay it's entertaining the picture quality is great the sound is awesome. When I saw amazon had it for only 26.99 I mean you can't beat that price anywhere it was defenitley worth the money so if your a Batman fan buy it now before the price goes up like gas, my house shakes when ever I watch the first Batman with the opening scene with the theme song of the movie it sounds great it's  something cool to show my kids what kinda crappy special effects Daddy thought was cool growing up because obviously there's no comparison to today's Batman from way back to 1989.

this are  cheap one layer double sided disks, the videos grainy.
I tested on my 23"" LCD monitor and they look ""decent"" and a bit clear...
but when I tested on my 42"" plasma it hurts my eyes to watch.

I will NEVER buy a set like this.

917858,5,6304613113,"This is an 8 disc set in four volumes, each volume containing a movie and special features, somewhat suitable for family viewing. The reason I say ""somewhat"" is that I would not recommend these movies for small children to view as some of the characters and scenes may frighten them because either they are a bit on the gruesome side or because the characters are dangling in the air high above the city, and things like that can play on a little one's fears.  Older children may not be so affected by them, though, and will probably enjoy them immensely.

These four movies are not nearly as dark as the newer ones, and compared to the newer Batman films, are much more light hearted and very enjoyable.  My opinion is that Keaton was the best Batman, but George Clooney is a close second - he didn't have the same Batman finesse but he made an awesome Bruce Wayne, where Keaton's Batman was awesome but his Bruce Wayne was far more easy going and laid back.  I enjoyed them both.

Val Kilmer's version wasn't bad, either, he was an alright Batman and an alright Bruce Wayne possessing the charm and integrity, but his look wasn't quite the same.

All in all, I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Batman.  I purchased these for Classic Cinema Online so that I can write my ""Bat Review"" based on Batman in Film - to include the movie serials from the 1940's, the tv series from the 1960's, and all of the Batman movies from 1966 to the most recent released, The Dark Knight, and am not one bit disappointed.  This particular set, of all the Batman movies, is my personal favorite.

It arrived on the day estimated and in excellent condition - I purchased mine new.  No complaints whatsoever.",1301616000,,1702,4.514657980456026

917975,4,6304613113,"Over the years, I have grown up with the Batman character, from the comics, cartoons, and even movies. I have always liked the character, and have been a fan ever since I was a child. When I saw the original films for the first time as a kid, I was quite surprised on how these films changed in style, acting, and even character development. The Batman Anthology is a great set for fans, both hardcore and casual. I got this collection on Blu-Ray, and really liked it. Although only the first three were worth watch and the fourth being the worst comic film of all time, I have to say, I was really impressed with the audio, picture quality, and visuals of these four films. Here are my verdicts:

BATMAN (1989): A true classic. Although Michael Keaton was reduced to a supporting role, His performance was excellent as the dark, twisted and somewhat crazy Batman character. Jack Nicholson shines as the Joker, providing the comedic and  tragic rendition of Batman's classic nemesis. Kim Basinger was okay as Vicki Vale, providing an elegance and sophistication to her role, and gives the film a light, romantic lift from its tragic overtones.

Overall 5 out of 5

BATMAN RETURNS (1992): A great sequel. This one had me entertained from the first scene onward. Keaton once again dons the cape, and is in the supporting role, despite it being the principal main character. Danny Devito is gritty, hilarious and sometimes disgusting as the tragic and garish Penguin, who tries to take over Gotham City. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show as Cat woman, who represents the dark, twisted side of female nature. She is sexy, seductive and perfectly believable as the secretary turned femme-fatale. Christopher Walken is excellent as Max Shreck, the downright dirty and corrupt business man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants in what he considers a ""dog eat dog"" world. Shreck also remains determined to leave his business behind for his son, Chip who he hopes will carry on his legacy.

Overall 5 out of 5

BATMAN FOREVER (1995): A Good sequel, but this is where things start to go bad..very bad. I liked, and will admit sometimes loved this movie, but it does have many flaws. Val Kilmer is the newcomer to the Batman Franchise, and provides a believable and brooding rendition to Batman, but lacks the playboy, jet-setter attitude that shapes his alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne. Kilmer is quite stale as Bruce, despite being taller, and more stylish looking than Keaton. In the Keaton Films, Batman was fighting for the soul of his city, determined to protect it from violent criminals and psychopaths. Now it seems, that Batman is just protecting the peace, showing up only when there's trouble, or out on a date. Jim Carrey on the other hand is excellent, if not sensational as the Riddler, delivering on his comedic, and acting talents. Every riddler/nygma scene is unique, giving a new shape and direction in Carrey's performance. Tommy Lee Jones is crazy and ruthless as Harvey Two face,  giving energy and humor to the character, but the script forces him to mimic the Joker's howling and laughing, which makes the character resemble the Joker than anything else. Two Face just wants to kill Batman, and crashes parties, Charity events and robs banks to do it. That's it! No unique Character Development! No tragic connections! No intrigue! I was expecting more out of the DA gone wrong, a district attorney obsessed with duality. Chris O' Donnell Stars as Robin- the orphaned acrobat we all know and love. His story is comes straight from the comics, and is well represented. His portrayal was focused and centered towards the young adults. Chris does a good job, and is very believable as a young man out for revenge. Nicole Kidman teases and tantalizes as the sexy, beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian- her scenes are one of the best parts of the film and her sex appeal is very evident in this movie. She seduces Batman, and the two share some kinky scenes in the film. She is unique as a female character, because she immediately goes after Batman, whose life is always in peril. Kidman looks her best with the blonde hair, red lips and all. She plays the role well, and brings elegance and sophistication to the picture. Her Character has one unique flaw- she's just a love interest, nothing more. I would have liked Chase even more if she had a unique connection to Bruce Wayne's past in some way, or even if she were to have more involvement in helping Batman stop criminals and protect Gotham from crime, rather than just throwing herself at him, and then ending the relationship. Still, Kidman is good as the damsel in distress.

Overall 4 out 5

BATMAN & ROBIN (1997): Simply: Unacceptable! To this day, I CANNOT believe this film was made! Even when I was a child I couldn't bare to watch it. It was so bad, it was painful to watch. It gave me a headache. It was too dumbed down for the kids! It looked too much like a toy commercial! George Clooney as Batman?  What were they thinking? Clooney is one hollywoods great actors and has been great to watch, but why Batman? I don't understand. O' Donnel returns as Robin, but again his character is also too dumbed down, where's the desire to right wrongs?  getting over the death of his family? It seems everything is just a bit too good for Dick Grayson this time around. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl-Although she was very attractive in the film- the writers got the batgirl character wrong- in the comics Batgirl is Comissioner Gordon's Daughter, forbidden from joining the GCPD. She doesnt even train or perfect her martial arts, she just puts on her costume, and without explantation or preamble starts fighting crime as Batgirl!! I still don't understand. Uma Thurman's Performance as Poison Ivy was good- the only thing done right. She is beautiful and seductive, much like Kidman and Pfeiffer were in the previous films. Arnold Shwarzenneger's performance as Mr. Freeze- it was funny, but too much one liners and not enough attention to the material. Again, these films are taken from comic books, why cant filmmakers pay attention to that? Bane- just a big thug, no smarts or human speech what so ever- he's not even determined to best Batman! Why? This film is terrible and if anyone enjoyed it, they maybe should get some help. My Advice: Just buy the first three films on blu-ray, don't get this one.

Overall 0.25 out 5

Final thoughts- These films were a trip back in time- Back when films were fun and engaging, not just character studies or tear-jerking dramas. I liked and thouroughly enjoyed the first three films and loved the nostalgia they carry with them.
Great for fans and movie lovers. The extras are the same as with the DVD version. But there are 8 language tracks including English (5.1), French (5.1) Spanish (Castillan 5.1, Latin 2S) Portuguese (2.0) German (5.1) and Italian (5.1) Also includes commentary by Directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher.

I loved Jim Carrey with his role as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face in Forever. Val Kilmer played Wayne in the movie. I best remember him as Jim Morrison in The Doors film.

### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's ""4 Film Favorites"" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The ""4 Film Favorites"" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.

918312,4,6304613113,"Even though half of these movies are not good, this is still a real find. The two good movies of the mid-era on one disc is both convenient and worth the price by themselves. Really, though, if you can find them both on separate DVDs for about the same money, about the only thing you'll be out is additional shipping and handling. I consider this being less worth the cost for having the later two movies included.

I can't do it! I can't not say anything about Batman and Robin! Its so bad! Its really bad! Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad! Its the saddest movie ever made. Not in the sentimental way, not in the tragic way. It just makes me very sad. Batman Forever, while far less bad, is no picnic either. Jim Carrey can be The Riddler, but why is The Riddler Jim Carrey? If you're looking for Riddler, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and even Bane and Batgirl, you'd be better off trying to find the animated series. Michael Gough's Alfred is the best performance and has the best writing on disc two by a disappointingly wide margin.

That said, Batman and Batman Returns are awesome! Some of Tim Burton's finest reality-based work, well cast. Brilliantly scored. These movies have some of the most perfect Batman music, including the two Nolan movies. And no matter where you stand on Nicholson vs Ledger for best Joker (I like Hamill myself), you've got to admit that on his own merits, Jack makes for an outstanding Clown Prince of Crime. Hes threatening and at the same time really funny in that special Joker way, the way he should be.

Oh, and Keaton was good as Bats.

Should you buy it? Well...about ten bucks for a whole set of movies is pretty much always a good deal, and when that set includes two classics, so much the better. I would say reserve disc two for one of those times you're looking for a movie to mock and tell yourself you only paid for disc one. Nobody should ever pay money for Batman and Robin unless it includes a night with Catwoman afterward.",1276560000,,1986,4.4779005524861875
918313,5,6304613113,"This collection of the four Batman movies from 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997 is a winner all around.  It comes with two dual-sided DVDs, with each DVD having a movie on each side.  The picture clarity is good, the sound quality is good, the price is good.

Here are the movies:

1. Batman (1989) starring Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, and Michael Gough.

2. Batman Returns (1992) starring Danny DeVito, Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Michael Murphy, and Pat Hingle.

3. Batman Forever (1995) starring Jim Carrey, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Chris O'Donnell, Nicole Kidman, Michael Gough, and Pat Hingle.

4. Batman & Robin (1997) starring George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Chris O'Donnell, Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, and Elle MacPherson.

Now this is just my opinion:  The two best movies were Batman (with Jack Nicholson as The Joker) and Batman Returns (with Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman), when Tim Burton was in charge.  These two movies are darker and a little more serious than Batman Forever (with Jim Carrey as The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face) and Batman & Robin (with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy), which are brighter and more campy.  I won't review each and every movie.  This review is basically about what this four movie collection contains and its low price and good picture and sound quality.

If you're a fan of the first Batman series, then get these four movies for a bargain price.  It's worth it.",1276214400,4,1647,5.007352941176471

Unless, of course, you can get the ""Superman"" 4 pack as well! Which is exactly what I did.
Love all these films. Keaton I liked better than Kilmer and Clooney put together but those films are still fun to watch. Arnold is always hard to take but in this one he's really funny. Clooney is...OK. That's all. Kilmer's version is lousy. When he says ""the car, yeah, the chicks love the car"" I almost threw up! He's always playing himself. Except when he played Jim in ""The Doors"". He was good in that film.
Keaton's low key treatment of Bruce Wayne was the best. Why they decided he wasn't worth the money I'll never know. Of course Jack's ""Joker"" was supreme and immeasureably better than what's his name who OD'd after making that ""The Dark Knight"" version of the story.
Tim Burton tried to stay true to the comic book persona and illustrations. He succeeded. The others tried to make it real and they failed.

The one con I will note about this collection is the digital copy. The digital copy is only of the first movie. Out of the original four, Batman Returns was my favorite.

I feel like they hooked a VCR up to a DVD recorder and had at it. I'm not even talking about grain (which I would expect from an older film transfer), but rather poor resolution. There are no solid diagonal lines, everything is blocky. The video looks like an SVCD that was poorly upconverted to DVD.

It's good value, if you're just looking for an affordable way to complete your collection, but if you're used to DVD-quality video, you will be disappointed...",1263427200,121,825,4.612244897959184

918613,5,6304613113,"If your a Batman fan, then this is a great set for you to own. The old Batman dvds did have a good picture and sound; However, I notice alot of my old snapcase dvds have amazing sound and picture but I digress. This dvds might be a step down in terms of picture quailty, which might shock alot of people but it's true. The bonus dvds are all set up the same-music videos, heros and villians of the films, a making of feature, and a little history of Batman. They are all very well done.

Batman (1989): This film is an all time classic. Tim Burton does a great job directing, Jack Nicholson is awesome as The Joker, and the film is very enjoyable.

Batman Returns: It has some good parts but I hate The Penguin as a villian. Never liked this movie but rewatching it again soon.

Batman Forever: Joel Schumacher replaces Burton as director and Robin makes his debut. Jim Carrey as The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face are good villians but they over do it. I don't really have a problem with this movie and enjoyed it overall.

Batman and Robin: People and critics hate this movie. The Dark Knight returns to his 60's roots as this movie is full of color rather then being dark and the dialouge is bad. I'm surprised they don't put wham! bam! during fight scenes. Clooney makes a weird choice for Batman but I love Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. I love Arnie in 80's action fare and this movie was no different. I enjoyed this movie and I don't consider it a bomb like everyone else.

I picked this up at my local Target on Thursday and watched all the batman movies through the weekend.  This set includes four Batman films.  Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997).  The special features include some character facts and production notes.  It is all very basic reading material on the disc, but I found a lot of it to be very interesting.  They could have had absolutely no special features at all, and I still would think this set is worth it!  Is this set better than the Motion Picture Anthology?  Well it depends on how much you care about these movies to want to watch all the special features for them.  I would say I wouldn't mind watching the special features of the first two movies, but the last two I could do without.  As far as the price goes, this set is better because it is only 10 bucks and the anthology is $80.  As far as picture quality goes, all the films looked great to me.  You can't really go wrong with this release, you get 4 films for 10 bucks in a single DVD case on 2 discs (and the discs are double sided with one movie on each side for those worried about compression)!  Talk about saving shelf space!  I am thinking of buying the other sets in this series like the superman and matrix collections and replacing my existing DVDs with them just to save shelf space alone!  Anyways this is the first of the ""4 film favorites"" collections that I have bought and I am very happy with the purchase.

However, Keaton's wonderful performance shocked audiences and so began a string of successful films that got progressively campier over time.

If you're like me, you thought ""Batman"" was excellent, liked ""Batman Returns"" even though alterations were made to the Penguin, enjoyed Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey in ""Batman Forever"" despite the campiness, and thanked the good Lord above that ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" managed to wipe away the stain of the fourth film in this collection, ""Batman and Robin.""

This ""Four Film Favorites"" collection gives fans of Batman and superheroes in general all four of Warner Brothers' late century versions of Batman on two bare bones discs. According to the box, each film comes with production notes.  What this boils down to is a stills gallery, brief actor bios, and a few lines about makeup, special effects, and Batman's wonderful toys.

The actual films are presented in a widescreen format and appear to lack any major clean-ups.  The first film is a bit grainy at moments and the third film had faint traces of pixellation in close-ups, but the second and fourth film look visually excellent.

I won't waste any time reviewing each film in depth.  If you want this collection, you probably already know why you are getting it.  I purchased it primarily for the first and third films in the franchise.  Being a completionist, though, I wanted to get the second and, yep, even the fourth film in this collection.  This two-disc set gives you all four films for a wonderful price.

Highly recommended to fans of Batman or comic book films who want all four of these movies without breaking the bank.  It will give you a taste of some of the best and some of the worst moments in comic film history!",1257033600,28,1994,4.829411764705882

918766,2,6304613113,"Let me make one thing ABUNDANTLY clear. I am a huge Batman fan. I've seen all of the silver screen and small screen incarnations of him, for better or worse. And the simple fact of the matter is that Tim Burton's BATMAN is one of the worst superhero films ever made. It looks cheap and thrown together in a mish-mash of steam-filled, dilapitated buildings, streets and factories. Aside from Anton Furst's art direction, which is superb and matches a maintains a good goth-noir attitude, the sets just look like they were built with papier-mache; it doesn't work as any kind of a story that stays true to the original comic (Batman sure kills a lot of people in this film and seems to be totally okay with that. But what Burton and writer Sam Hamm seemed to forget is that Batman DOESN'T kill. EVER.); the set pieces of the film, like the Art Museum and the ensuing Batmobile chase, and the parade and the Batwing attack (please freeze-frame the moments where Batman is flicking toggle-switches in the Batwing... especially in Blu Ray... because you will very clearly see a toggle marked ""VOLUME"". They took apart a stereo and made a control panel... ugh) are terribly unsatisfying, and the worst of the lot is the Cathedral finale... Tim, I know that you want to be the voice for all the goth/emo kids out there, so I can appreciate that you had to give it the full sturm und drang with that scene, but did you have to make it plod on like some kind of soap opera? The script is sub-par even for a ""comic book"" movie. It actually felt like these guys had never read a single issue. Oh, and the performances are just horrific. There isn't a single moment that any of these actors have that seem real for their characters. And Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne was just awful casting for such a great actor. There wasn't a second I bought him as either Wayne or Batman. He's distant, boring, and charmless as Wayne, and incredibly stiff as Batman. Kim Basinger... well, come on. Need I say more? Jack was the worst of the lot, chewing the scenery like every piece of drywall was covered in chocolate. I'm all for an over-the-top bad guy, but that was almost as bad as Hopkins in the Hannibal Lecter role. Just all wrong. In every way. The only other high point other than Anton Furst? Danny Elfman's score is still great to this day. It's iconic and super-heroic. It's the anti-John Williams SUPERMAN score, and that works because it's Batman. But PRINCE??? No... I'm not even going there.

RETURNS suffers from many of the same problems as the first film: Tim Burton's desire to turn every character into some kind of freakshow; the cheapness of the sets, the poorly-constructed and directed action set pieces. But it improves in two ways: The script, mostly reworked by Daniel Waters actually has a great deal of dark humor and wit, which makes the film more entertaining to sit through. And the performances are better. Michelle Pfieffer is wonderful as Catwoman (although it has nothing to do with who Selina Kyle is in the actual comics, I was okay with this interpretation), and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck is grand entertainment. DeVito as The Penguin seemed like perfect casting, but he still plays it like he's a horny Burgess Meredith impersonator. The reason that some of his scenes work pretty well is thanks to Waters' writing. An extremely flawed film, but nowhere near as bad as the first one.

Well, I'm done ripping into these films in detail. But I actually will watch the Schumacher-directed films before I'd ever watch either of the Burton films again. BATMAN FOREVER, no matter what people say, at least has a good Batman and a good Bruce Wayne. The Batman in the Schmacher films is athletic and dynamic, as opposed to the Robo-Bat that Burton showed us. And Val Kilmer was a good Wayne as well. He has a lot more wit and charm. Yes, Carrey is as annoying as ever; Tommy Lee Jones was horribly miscast as Two-Face; Chris O'Donnell... Hot Knife and a Wet Paper Bag should give a few clues. Nicole Kidman has never looked sexier than she did in FOREVER, though.

BATMAN AND ROBIN is such an amazing train-wreck of a film that its watchability is almost hypnotic. As you watch it, you can't BELIEVE that someone actually agreed to put that script and those performances to film, but you just can't look away. It should have cult film status.",1254528000,,4358,4.627906976744186

918771,3,6304613113,"First of all, let me tell you that I like to watch these movies from time to time, even the last two, which (with all due respect to the people involved in their production) were two bombs. So to put it in perspective, let's compare it to another high profile catalog movie franchise, namelly the ""Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection"". Although a lot of people are complaining about the use of DNR (digital noise reduction) on some of the Star Trek titles, the fact is, those movies have NEVER looked so good.

So there you have a box with five great films and a bad one for $69.49, which means each film for $11.58 (if you only buy it for the good films, then it would be $13.90 per film). Now, here we have the Batman films, which have been released in special edition DVDs a relatively short time ago (so the improvement in quality is not as noticeable as with the Star Trek films) which contains two great films and two bombs for $83.49, meaning each film for $20.87 (if you only buy it for the good films, it would mean $41.74 per film).  I imagine that most of the people who ever intended to purchase these films heve already purchased the SE DVDs. Of course, the Blu-ray editions are an overall improvement and I do intend to buy them, but NOT at this price. So, Warner Video, I realize you only care about numbers, so here are some numbers for you to consider:

Batman Anthology

Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection

While some of the special features can be repetitive (such as the Heroes & Villains galleries), the featurettes that detail how the films were made are adequate enough to keep your interest, especially the Batman & Robin Special Features disc.

As one would expect, with each progressing film the picture gets better. But even Batman and Batman Returns look great, especially considering how old the source material is. This is, without a doubt, a must have for any die-hard Batman fan if you want to experience the first four films in the highest quality available.

It even makes Batman and Robin more enjoyable even though it is the worst one of them all.

This set,however, could been absolutely seen as a rip off to people who own the set on 8 disc regular dvd as it has the same special features that was on the previous one that was discontinued but now reavailable again.

The 5th disc is the digital copy of Batman.

I have watched all four movies and picture quality only gets better as the movies go on. The picture quality of Batman is excellent, you can't ask for a whole lot more from a movie this old. Detail is very fine, it becomes obvious when sets are being used, you can see Batman's strings holding him up when he flies. There are few artifacts and little grain, even though the movie is mostly dark. The sound is fine.

The Blu Ray disc enhances every detail on the movies so well you will notice things that you have never picked up on before. Ahhh.....the beauty of Blu Ray.

 Amazon priced this set nicely, and the price for the set of movies ($84.00) is fair to me. It equates to $21 a disc which includes all the special features on each disc. Not to mention free two day shipping. If I were shopping for these separately, I would end up driving to every retail chain in town selling Blu Ray discs to find the four because the unpopular Batman movies will be the only ones available. Don't forget to include the fuel cost for driving all over the county and tax on each disc. And you probably will not buy them at $21 a pop.
 Another good thing about this set is the price is not marked up by including a gimmicky ""box"" or ""tin"" or whatever the ""container of the week"" is. This set is bundled in a cool little three piece cardboard sleeve that encases the four discs in their respective Blu Ray cases.

It's hard to not compare them to the newer ""Nolan"" films, but in their time most of them were very good and entertaining! This box set features all four of the Batman films from 1989 through the 90's on individual two disc editions. The packaging is solid and I like the films being in individual cases. The DVD transfers and extras are excellent and if your a fan of the series, it's well worth picking up. I will review each film as I watch them and add ratings to this review, but will do full reviews on the individual releases.

I have not seen The Dark Knight yet,(I know I know!) and I wanted to watch these films again before seeing the ""new and improved"" version of Batman (The Dark Knight). I think when watching these movies we have to remember that Batman in the late 30's was just a 10 cent comic book for kids, it was many years later was the elaborate back story and psychological aspects were added to the character. I think Burton was trying to capture the feeling of the first comic....he did, but unfortunately some of the TV show found it's way in! Don't get me wrong, I love the TV show for what it is, campy, over the top and fun! It just doesn't work well with the original vision of The Dark Knight.

So please take off your jaded judgmental hats and enjoy these films for what they are and remember without the original Superman and Batman movies, films like Blade, Spider-man, Iron Man, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight may have never got off the ground!

Batman
First ground-breaking, jaw-breaking movie of the original series.  Keaton is passable as Batman even though he's just way too wimpy-looking with the curly hair.  This is the movie that breaks Batman out of its camp.  This is to Batman movies what The Dark Knight Returns is to comics.  Nicholson steals the show and adds some humor to this dark, gothy Batman.

Batman Returns
Even better than the original.  Burton has full creative freedom and is now allow to make a Burton film which really shines in this movie.  Some of the best Batman action you will ever see without the use of fancy vehicles or machinery (Yes, action you would not even see in Nolan's series)  This is the darkest Batman movie I ever saw (Even darker than Nolan's Dark Knight, and bloodier).  Penguin is a disfigured hobo that comes out of the sewer.  Michelle Peiffer plays catwoman.  Need I say more?  The blood and spookiness is probably what made parents complaining to WB and resulting in the dismissal of Burton and in turn would give us...

Batman Forever
Total camp as demanded by the studios.  Contrary to what people think, the director wanted to do a dark Batman, but complaints from fuming parents brought the studio to its knees.  It is not bad, as Batman battles a giggly Riddler (Not a great villain) and a joker-esque Two-Face (Horrible, just horrible).  Nicole Kidman as Dr Chase is lackluster.  It is hard to believe that this is the same woman that won an Oscar!  Are there any good things about this movie?  Hardly.  Batmobile looks like a toy (Oh yeh, they are trying to sell toys).  Gotham City never look so fake.  The introduction of Robin and his origin is probably the only good thing about this movie.

Batman & Robin
This is the movie that killed the franchise for a while until Nolan rebooted it.  Personally, I prefer this over Forever, but that's not really saying much.  Batman and Robin battles Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane.  Batgirl pitches in to help.  Maybe it's the horrible Mr Freeze one-liners delivered by none other than the Governator himself, or the many costumed crotch shots shown, or the corny ""I'll get drive-thru"" joke lines (Were they supposed to be funny?), or the gazillion marketing promotions like Batcard that killed this movie, but the snow scenes do allow you to reminice the Batman Returns days and Poison Ivy is possibly the hottest villain vixen on-screen.",1220745600,2,2633,4.671023965141612
919092,5,6304613113,"This review focuses on Burton's Batman (Batman89, Batman Returns), Nolan's Batman (Batman Begins, the Dark Knight), and 1992 original Batman: The Animated Series. I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and ""The Batman"", simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.

To be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally. All three interpretations are so different, that they cannot be compared. And it is really annoying that I find people on YouTube trying to see which one is better (most opinions are biased). So here it goes with MY opinions:

BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances. Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much. Bale really acts well as Bruce Wayne, but his voice for Batman is too deep and goofy. To me, Keaton is the ultimate ""Bruce"". He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's. It's too bad that he doesn't get that much screen time in both of Burton's films.

VILLAINS: Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Clayface, Mad Hatter, Scarface, Killer Croc, Bane, Baby Doll, Penguin, Clock King, Harley Quinn, Professor Milo, Poison Ivy, and Rupert Thorne appear only on BTAS, and they are marvelous in their own right.

The Scarecrow was better portrayed in BTAS (voice by Henry Polic II) than he was in Begins. Cillian Murphy looked too young as Doctor Crane, and the actual villain was much underused in the film. Two-Face had the scariest appearance in TDK; Aaron Eckhardt was flawless. However, Two-Face in BTAS (Richard Moll) had a much better origin. Years of suppressing anger can do that, you know. Ra's al Ghul is much more interesting in BTAS (David Warner); Liam Neeson's performance in BB was just above average as he wasn't very believable to me. The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS. Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist. Same goes with Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer had the better dialogue and better catsuit, while Adrienne Barbeau was a better Selina Kyle, and her chemistry with Batman is deeper.

Finally, for the Joker we have Jack Nicholson (B89), Mark Hamill (BTAS), and Heath Ledger (TDK). All three of them are perfect. Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism. Three different worlds, three different performances. People on YouTube should understand that.

SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: I couldn't see Michael Caine as Alfred, so it's thumbs down from me. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Michael Gough are the ideal Alfred's. Aaron Eckhardt is truly a one-of-a-kind Harvey Dent. I Believe in Harvey Dent! Billy Dee Williams was great in B89, also, and he had the tough and virtuous personality, as did Richard Moll in BTAS. Gary Oldman and Bob Hastings are the definitive Commissioner Gordon's; Pat Hingle is the weakest, but certainly not at all terrible. He's just a bit too short. Morgan Freeman is the one and only Lucius Fox; Brock Peters of BTAS had the better persona, but Freeman had the better chemistry with Batman.

GOTHAM CITY: Burton captured the dark and gothic feel of the hellish city perfectly. It looks as if ""Hell came sprouting out of the concrete and kept right on growing. You gotta give credit to Anton Furst, the film's art director, for creating this atmospheric universe. Gotham in BTAS also has its advantages. The towering skyline, the dangerous alleys, and the red sky make it all more mesmerizing. Nolan's Gotham looks hellish, too, but it looks too much like Chicago (filming location for both BB and TDK). But other than that, it succeeds in creating a Faustian nightmare.

EVERYTHING ELSE: The gadgets in BTAS were the most realistic, while the Batmobile for B89 was better-looking. Keaton's Batsuit is classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening. The heroines (Basinger, Holmes, and Gyllenhaal) are lovely additions, although I wish Basinger would stop screaming throughout B89. And let's not forget the music: let's give it up for Danny Elfman, Shirley Walker, James Newton Howard, and Hans Zimmer. These are the composers who gave us those catchy Batman themes. We will never forget them or their work.

CONCLUSION: Burton's universe, Nolan's universe, and Timm's universe are near ideal. I love them equally, really. I can't wait for the next film.",1220227200,2,4553,5.051930758988016

919160,3,6304613113,"Alright. I'll try to be brief.

Batman was good. Joker was weird. but it was interesting to see the 80's take on Batman. The new rubber suit looked very, very stiff. I know they all are, but this was the stiffest. I liked the beginning, but the bat sign on his chest has too many sharp angles that looks ugly. Other than that the story was good, very dark too. Keaton doesn't play the rich boy, playboy persona too well but you get used to it. Surprising that it was joker who killed his parents. Very surprising. 3 out of 5 stars.

Batman Returns was really good. Loved the suit. It fit more on Keaton and wasn't bloated like the first. Absolutely great Catwoman. Michelle Phieffer nailed that part. Penguin was really weird but Danny nailed it too. My one gripe is that they should really stage some good fight scenes. It seems like Batman is just a walking display. Good movie. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.

Batman Forever...well it was a strange movie. New Bruce...New Batman...Different style. Extremely bright crazy lights and alot of an overreacting Two Face. Riddler was great and funny. Good job Jim. I liked this when it first came out mostly because the action improved alot. Great fights. Hideous Batmobile. Great Robin story. I give it a 3 out of 5, only because it was a lot less realistic than Returns.

Batman and Robin was a complete joke. I actually saw this in the theaters. What a bad movie. Period. I heard the same guys who made the Power Rangers kid show made this. No wonder. Way to goofy and stupid. Even the action couldn't save it. Bad Ivy, Bane is a walking, bulking dunce who only says ""AAUUURGHH!"" What is with Mr. Freeze. Arnold? Of all the people. Arnold? He was so cheesy in this. Batgirl doesn't help either. This is where everyone thought (including myself) that Batman sunk and would never be ressurected...until he ""Begins"" again in '05.

919164,4,6304613113,"Ok....even though I used that title I agree with some.....

Batman Forever and Batman & Robin weren't as good as the first 2 Tim Burton flix.

BUT..........

It's Batman. Plain and simple. The acting was good. A bit over the top and ""cartoony"" under J.S.'s direction but the actors can't be blamed. Joel envisioned it that way. He didn't know the characters as well as Tim.

Clooney has been known to say that he had a hand in ruining the franchise. I disagree. George did a great job. He had the feel, look, heart and drive of Bruce Wayne/Batman.

Val did as well. Both men did excellent jobs with what they had to play with. I honestly believe that the ""failure"" of these movies was due to Schumacher's loss of vision of who The Batman really is. He looked at The Batman as a cartoon. If you're doing Spongebob Squarepants that's fine. But The Batman is dark, determined and won't let anything stop him from achieving his goal. The J.S. movies felt fake and limited.

The loss of Danny Elfman's music also added to the decline. Goldenthal is good.....but let's face facts....he's no Elfman. Danny has the gut feeling for the characters and the chops to bring everything he touches into a different world.

The main difference is the direction. Tim Burton is the man! Everything he touches turns to gold. He's great. We know it. His vision and integrity is what Hollywood should be all about.

All this being said I think, overall that the set deserves a good rating. It's nicely packaged and has a quality about it that will keep any fan interested.

Also.......

Check out BATMAN BEGINS! A new twist.....a new vision.....different, fresh....and right on the spot!

One more thing...Alfred. One of the cardinal rules was the sanctity of the batcave and the secret identity of Batman.  What does alfred do? Brings Vicki Vale down there for a look around, moron. Everything else...for the time it came out, Gotham, The Batmobile, the gadgets, the Batjet? Pretty cool.

 In 'Batman Returns' Keaton isn't the only one who makes a return appearance.  Tim Burton helms this films directors seat a second time. This Film wasn't as strong as Burtons first outing. It was visually stunning, but it felt enclosed like you knew you were watching something that was filmed on a set. Rather than the illusion that you were watching something actually film in the city.  I think Burton drops the ball with this film trying to do to many things in the same film. First you have the plot with the Penguin(played by Danny DeVito) with him trying to find out who his parents are and trying to overthrow the city by getting into public office.  Next you have the subplot with the Catwoman(played by Michelle Pfieffer---no theres something no special effect can top-Pfieffer in a skintight vinyl body suit with high heals and a whip!), is she a good guy, a bad guy who knows! Then theres the corporate bad guy Max Schreck(played by Christopher Walken) whos involved directly with all the characters.  Theres just too much going on with all these secondary characters and not enough Batman. Which is why I think Keaton backed out after this film. He thought his character was taking a back seat to the supporters.

I thought the climax of the film with the penguin sending his penguin army into Gotham with missles strapped to their backs was a little ridiculous, it reminded me of the old Adam West Batman TV show.

The Franchise starts to buckle with the release of the Third Batman in 'Batman Forever' Even though I thought Val Kilmer played a good batman and an even better bruce wayne, I think that placing Joel Schumaker in the directors chair was a huge mistake.  In the First two films Gotham is dark gothic city with style.  In this third outing under Schumakers supervision, gotham is slowly being transformed from Burtons Gothic city scape into a neon drenched tokyo shangri-la! Absolute Garbage!  The plot?  The Riddler(Jim Carrey) creates a mind control device thats used through a Television Cable Unit that kind of looks like a blender.  All financed by stolen funds when he joins forces with Two Face(Tommy Lee Jones).  This Film sees the introduction of Robin the boy wonder(Chris O'donnell)Big mistake which leads to the dumbest line emmitted in the film,""Holy Rusted metal batman!""  Jim Carrey as the Riddler? Great I get to watch Jim Carrey play the Riddler as Jim Carrey, not good. I would have paid real money to watch Frank Gorshen reprise his role from the old tv show.

Which brings me to the Final film in this boxed set 'Batman and Robin' why? because people did throw away good money to watch this rubbish. George Clooney takes up the role as the dark knight....no let me rephrase that, the caped crusader! Comic book fans bow their collective heads in a moment of silence as the franchise takes a crippling blow in the form of a lame batman film. Filled with comic book origin catastrophes abound. Like the film before it, this movie sees the introduction of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone), but as alfred niece? Supposed to be Commisioner Gordons daughter, but since Burton botched that one in the first film with Pat Hingle....things are burying themselves quickly. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Victor Freeze, o.k. but the outfit, too much again Mr. Schumaker. and when the Mr. Freeze henchmen come out on Ice skates. It was the TV show all over again.  Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, not bad. But when batman and robin fight over her in the Gotham Auction(Batman pulls rank on Robin with his ""Bat-Credit card"")just ruined the whole thing for me. And the Character Bane, was such a turning point in the batman comic book when he breaks batman's back.  Cheeses out in this film as Poison Ivy's muscle.

This boxed set is  a nice addition to a dvd library if you can get over the last two films(almost like superman 3 & 4) Bottom Line....not bad. A little too much for a marathon you might want to break it up, 1 and 2 then 3 and 4-on a diffent night.",1153180800,5,5272,4.798895027624309
919237,3,6304613113,"In 1942, artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger created one of greatest superheroes- Batman, who's once Bruce Wayne, a crimefighter took a symbol of a bat to frighten into the hearts of criminals, many years after the death of his parents, Thomas and Martha. He have enemies like The Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, Two-Face, Bane, love interset Catwoman, etc. In 1960s, they made a campy TV show on ABC, which making fun of Batman. Cancelled after 3rd season. Throughout from 1989 to present day, they made Batman movies and cartoons. I'm a true ""bat"" fan, grew up watching the cartoons, never read the comics. Only live-action movies that were true to him were Tim Burton movies. I'll clear it up.

1. Batman(1989) w/ Michael Keaton(Bruce Wayne/Batman), Kim Basinger(Vicki Vale) and Jack Nicholson(Jack Napier a.k.a The Joker) directed by Tim Burton- This is what it supposed to be. a dark, gothic version of New York- Gotham City. a dark, mysterious hero- Batman. Interseting that he just started his crimefighting days, unknown to the city. The villan is former criminal Jack Napier, who framed by his boss Carl Grissom, who turned into the Clown Prince of Crime himself, The Joker. Vicki Vale, who ain't proved much as love interset, came to Gotham to find out about Batman, then she became more interseting in Bruce and attracted to The Joker. Can Batman save Vicki and Gotham City from The Joker?

  I love it. Michael Keaton was the best batman. Kim Baginser was good as the lovely Vicki Vale. Jack Nicholson is an awesome Joker. Tim is the best director for Batman. 5/5

  2. Batman Returns(1992) w/ Michael Keaton(Bruce Wayne/Batman),  Christopher Walken(Max Schreck), Danny DeVito(Oswarld Cobbelpot a.k.a The Penguin) and Michelle Pfeffier(Selina Kyle/Catwoman) directed by Tim Burton- Much darker. Style to Gothic version of New York. A baby whose born as a penguin were abandoned to a sewer. He grew up becoming The Penguin. A tycoon Max Shreck plans to steal Gotham's power supply, but the mayor refuses. When The Penguin got his help, he got him run for mayor so reveals his plan. But The Penguin really kidnapping childrens. In the middle of it, Selina Kyle find out Max's plans so he kills her. She brought back to life by cats, becoming Catwoman. Out of their costumes, Bruce and Selina became lovers. Selina is perfect love interset, accorrding to the comics. Will Batman save Gotham from The Penguin? Will Selina go home with Bruce?

 I love it. Michael Keaton is still the best Batman. Michelle Pfeffier is great as the fine-looking Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Danny DeVito is an incredicle Penguin. Tim is still the best director for Batman. 5/5

3. Batman Forever(1995)- the franchise begin to be ruined.  Joel Schmucher must be the worst director in superhero movies of all time. it turned into like that campy TV show. It's just a kid movie. Batman became a rolemodel. What? Man, Robin is a freaking moron. I love Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, but they were awful. I prefer Billy Dee Williams(from Batman) again as Harvey Dent and as Two-Face, and maybe Robin Williams as The Riddler. Nicole Nidman were terrible, like a woman is after sex. Must be a silly script. I didn't like Val Kilmer's character to Batman. 2/5

4. Batman & Robin(1997)- Franchise ruined. What was Joe Schmucher thinking? George Clooney was the worst Batman. Robin is a complete moron. Mr. Freeze, Posion Ivy and Bane were terrible. Not even good Batgirl! Terrible script! 2/5

Begins is like a fanastic fairly tale.

Just stick with first two. They are BATMAN.",1150588800,2,3567,4.892205638474295
919238,3,6304613113,"Take out four and three, and we will have the true Batman collection. Enough said.",1146268800,3,82,4.533333333333333
919239,3,6304613113,"There are two DVD box sets that contain the Batman movies of Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher - The Batman Legacy and The Batman Motion Picture Anthology. My advice is to see these movies ahead of time, and buy the ones you like individually. I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T WANT TO BUY ALL FOUR MOVIES - unless of course, you're a DVD collector like me, who loves DVD extras. A serious DVD collector will not buy The Batman Legacy - they'll shell out some extra coin to get The Batman Motion Picture Anthology. That box set comes with 18 hours of extras. The Batman Legacy doesn't have any good DVD extras, so movie buffs won't be interested in getting that box set. But if you don't care about DVD extras, and just want to acquire all four films, you may as well get The Batman Legacy.

As a fan of the Batman comics, I can recognize a lot of problems with all four movies. The first two were directed by Tim Burton, and are generally well-liked today. But the last two were directed by Joel Schumacher, and they're generally reviled by everyone. These Batman movies show what happens when a popular series is put in the hands of a director with a completely different vision, who ultimately destroys the series. THAT is the lasting legacy of this series. The series lost a lot of steam after Schumacher made Batman Forever, a movie that alienated a lot of Batman fans. Then Schumacher made Batman & Robin - and the series lost all credibility after that movie came out. In the case of the Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus (who directed the first two Potter movies) said he wanted to ensure that the next Potter director would not stray too far from the style of his first two movies - and he cited this Batman series as an example of what he hoped to avoid.

Burton's movies are enjoyable - but a little ridiculous. Some of the villains and goons were a bit too cartoonish for my liking in Batman Returns, but they're WAY too cartoonish in the Schumacher movies. However, the character of Batman in Burton's movies is perfect. Batman may be a hero, but the character is so dark and gritty that there's a real malevolence to him. The Kilmer and Clooney Batmen didn't have that malevolence - so viewers won't experience the sense of awe and wonder that Keaton's Batman evoked from them.

Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) is in the first Batman movie. He doesn't turn into Two-Face in this movie. I figure they wanted Dent to appear in this movie with the hope of making him a villain in a future sequel. Williams doesn't add much of anything to this movie - but it would have been AWESOME if Burton had Williams play Two-Face in a Batman sequel. Too bad Two-Face doesn't appear until Batman Forever, when Schumacher took over. Even though Batman Forever is a sequel, Schumacher completely ignores Williams' portrayal of Dent, and cooks up a completely different character for Tommy Lee Jones to play. In a Burton movie, it's safe to say that Williams would be playing a leaner, meaner and less eccentric Two-Face than we saw in Schumacher's movie. The first Batman is also the only movie of the series where the villain's goons are cool - but they would have been cooler if they kept their old fashioned mobster appearance of fedoras and trenchcoats. The goons in Batman Begins are ninjas - and there are few things on Earth that are cooler than ninjas.

Batman Forever was a rude awakening for those of us who expected the Batman series to retain the same style as Burton's movies. Schumacher and the writers didn't know how to make a good Batman movie, and Kilmer was miscast as Batman. Batman didn't deserve the title of 'World's Greatest Detective' in Batman Forever. He should've done some investigating into Nygmatech when he suspected that ""the box"" could be used for evil purposes. Batman certainly dropped the ball that time. Anyway, Schumacher was trying to make Batman Forever a much more lighthearted film. Then he made the travesty that is Batman and Robin, which is like an updated remake of Batman: The Movie and the Adam West TV series. And for the record, I'm a big fan of the Adam West TV show. That show was a product of its time. But IT'S NOT suitable for this day and age - Schumacher should've known better. But I imagine he was a huge fan of the TV series, and this was probably his way of paying homage to it. Another serious problem with his movies was the way the villains were portrayed. Bane, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, and Two-Face were all too obnoxious and/or annoying for my liking. I expect The Joker to behave like a clown, but TWO-FACE and MR. FREEZE? What was Schumacher thinking?

Let me put it this way. If you loved Batman and/or Batman Returns, you'll probably be able to tolerate Batman Forever, but you'll HATE Batman and Robin. If you love the Adam West TV show, you might like Schumacher's movies. But it's hard to say, because Batman & Robin is a terrible movie, whether you like bright and cheerful superhero movies or not. Fans of the Batman comic books will appreciate Burton's movies, dislike Schumacher's movies, and LOVE Batman Begins - but that movie isn't a part of this Batman series, so it's not in this DVD set.

I myself will be getting the Anthology - I'd LOVE to hear the commentaries from Schumacher. I'm curious to hear what he was thinking as he made those movies. Thank God Batman Begins came along - the start of an entirely NEW Batman series. Now I can forget about Schumacher's movies, and all the problems with Burton's movies. I like Burton's two movies a lot. But Christopher Nolan's NEW BATMAN SERIES will become the best comic book movie series of all-time. Mark my words.",1144540800,,5645,4.584158415841584

The Third and Fourth movies to me were more like a mixture between the first two and the 60's batman tv show.

919357,4,6304613113,"While those of discriminating tastes may want to purchase their favorite Batman films separately instead of getting them all, it is kinda nice to have all of them in one set. It is a fascinating arc of how the franchise started off strong and then got progressively worse until Batman and Robin effectively killed it for eight years until Batman Begins came along. Each movie gets a souped up, special edition makeover.

Each movie features a wealth of supplemental material including a theatrical trailer, Heroes and Villains mini-profiles (that mix clips from the movie with interview soundbites from cast, crew and pundits) and a multi-part retrospective documentary entitled, ""Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight.""

Batman features an excellent audio commentary by Tim Burton who kicks things off by addressing the criticism fans had back in the day that given his background he would make a movie closer to the goofy `60s T.V. show. He loved the show but wanted to go back to the original comic book and place an emphasis on the scary psychology of Batman. The filmmaker covers all the bases including the challenges of dealing with the studio, problems with the script and replacing an injured Sean Young with Kim Basinger on short notice.

""Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman"" is an excellent look at the legacy of this enduring icon with the likes of Harlan Ellison, Frank Miller and Kevin Smith talking about what makes this character work so well.

""On the Set with Bob Kane"" features a brief interview with the man who created Batman. He talks about how he came up with the concept and gives the Burton version his approval.

""Shadows of the Bat"" is broken up into three parts and traces the development of Burton's film in great detail. Many of the major players in front of and behind the camera contributed new interviews, including Keaton, Nicholson (who is in fine form), Basinger and even Sean Young! Coupled with Burton's insightful commentary track, this is an excellent look at how the movie came together and the challenges it faced.

""Beyond Batman"" is comprised of six featurettes that explore all the technical stuff: production design, props, the Batmobile, the Batsuit and the music.

""Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboard Sequence."" Originally, Robin was to make an appearance in a chase sequence between Batman and the Joker but it only made it to the storyboard stage.

Finally, there are three music videos by Prince that are dated but interesting to watch nonetheless.

Batman Returns features another relaxed commentary by Tim Burton who praises the cast and goes into detail about his intentions with this movie. ""The Bat, The Cat and The Penguin"" is a making of featurette done back in the day and hosted by Robert Urich. There is a definite emphasis on the three lead actors with some good on-the-set footage.

The fourth installment of the ""Shadows of the Bat"" takes a fresh look at this movie. In a refreshingly candid moment, Burton addresses the criticism of too many villains in this movie.

""Beyond Batman"" features a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, taking us through the incredible scale and scope of a production this size.

Finally, there is a video for ""Face to Face"" by Sixousie and the Banshees. These veteran Goth rockers were the perfect match for Burton's sensibilities.

Batman Forever features an audio commentary by Joel Schumacher. He still can't believe all the uproar caused by the nipples on the Batsuit. Amazingly, he claims that some Warner Brothers executives did not want him to cast Kidman because she wasn't sexy enough!

""Riddle Me This: Why is Batman Forever?"" is a promotional featurette hosted by Chris O'Donnell and done at the time of the film's release. There are the usual cast and crew soundbites that feature everyone gushing about the movie and their characters.

Part Five of the Shadows of the Bat documentary features Schumacher, Kilmer and O'Donnell back for new interviews as they try and defend the choices they made for this movie. One producer describes it as ""Saturday Night Fever on acid.""

""Beyond Batman"" features a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, including production design, stunts, visual effects and the soundtrack. This was the biggest Batman film yet and the massive sets, state-of-the-art SFX and make-up reflect that.

There are seven deleted scenes including Two-Face's escape from Arkham Asylum that was cut from the beginning of the movie.

Finally, there is a music video for ""Kiss from a Rose"" by Seal, but where is the fantastic video for ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"" by U2?

Schumacher contributes another audio commentary for Batman and Robin. He talks about how the studio wanted a more kid-friendly, family-oriented Batman even though he wanted to adapt Frank Miller's Batman: Year One. One can sense the disappointment in Schumacher's voice at this missed opportunity.

The final part of ""Shadows of the Bat"" doesn't quite maintain the upbeat, everything-was-fine-on-this-movie vibe that is prevalent on the other parts. O'Donnell admits that he felt like he was making a toy commercial. Because the previous film was a success there was a lot of pressure to repeat it. Schumacher admits that the biggest mistake was getting the toy company involved and they influenced the look of the movie.

""Beyond Batman"" covers the usual aspects of the movie: production design, the vehicles, costumes, make-up and visual effects.

There is a deleted scene that attempts to give Alfred a backstory but it is pretty brief.

Finally there is a diverse collection of music videos from the likes of The Smashing Pumpkins, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, R. Kelly and Jewel. Most of them feature clips from the movie mixed with performance footage except for Jewel and R. Kelly who is too busy self-mythologizing to worry about things like a movie.",1133308800,6,5949,5.017258883248731

919359,5,6304613113,"This box set is a must for Batman fans. It includes the four films (in widescreen) produced between 1989-1997. The two disc editions include commentaries on each film by the directors, and excellent documentaries covering the production of each film in detail. There are surprisingly candid comments from both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher about the films, and the direction the studio wanted each of them to take with their respective projects.

Here's a brief recap of the four films:

Batman (1989) - Batman vs. the Joker (wildly played by Jack Nicholson), excellent production design, great atmosphere.

Batman Returns (1992) - Batman vs. Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) in a a dark, moody sequel. Seen as a disappointment upon release, it improves with age. Great score by Danny Elfman, excellent performances all around.

Batman Forver (1995) Exit Burton and Michael Keaton, enter Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer for a lighter, more action-oriented installment with Jim Carrey as The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face.  Lighter in tone, but great fun.

Batman & Robin (1997) - what many consider the nadir of the series, as George Clooney takes over as Batman, and Schumacher takes things much closer to the camp spirit of the tv show. Messy plot, overwhelming at times, but still fun if you're more in the mood for something in the style of the 60s tv series. Not as strong as ""Forever"" though Uma Thurman is fun as Poison Ivy and Arnold Shwarzenegger is ok as Mr. Freeze. Definitely the least of the series, with interesting comments from some of the participants on the extras on where it went wrong.

All in all, an essential set, even if you only want two or three of the films. Try a Bat-marathon, including the 1966 tv spinoff  ""Batman: The Movie"" and Chris Nolans excellent ""Batman Begins"" from this past summer, which are not included in the set.",1131321600,6,1891,4.905956112852665

For those who complained that Warner Bros. released these two disc specail editions to make more money, you must be unaware that when DVDs first came out in 1997 the idea of specail features hadn't really caught on yet. The first four Batman films were among those first released.

These new versions not only include new making-of documentaries, but some vintage trailers and music videos as well. They also have DTS tracks and commentary tracks by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher that go well with the new transfers of the films. And they have subtitles in English, French, and Spanish for the movies only.

My favorites are Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", though I also really like Schumacher's ""Batman Forever""  Only his ""Batman and Robin"" seem to be a weak link in the series, though it's maybe not quite as bad as a lot of people make it out to be.

The first four ""Batman"" films are represented here with 2 discs covering each film in widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, with director's commentary.

""Batman""
 - Disc 1: feature film & one (!) theatrical trailer (""Warner"" advertised the sh*t out of this film in 1989 & all they put is one release trailer!)

Disc 2: On the set with Bob Kane -the creator of ""Batman"" takes a small tour thru the set of the first film. It lasts about 2 minutes & really isn't worth losing sleep over, if you miss it.

""Shadows Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight"" Parts 1-3: this is definitely worth checking out. Everything you pretty much need to know about the progression of Batman from the comic pages of D.C. to the big screen release of the first film is here. If there is a reason to get this box set this is it. Big thumbs up.

""Legends OF The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman""
Need another reason to own this box set? here it is. Doc covers the complete history of Batman, from an idea of Bob Kane's, to comic hero, to T.V. star of the 60's, to big screen Dark Knight hero of the 80's & 90's. Another big thumbs up.

""Batman"" Documentary Gallery - O.K. look behind the scenes at making the film. From the gadgets & sets, to the costumes & the score. Cool enough to look at, but, something you would expect from a box set like this.

Hero & Villians Profiles - basically, a bit of a rehash look at the main characters from the first film.

Robin storyboard sequence - an idea that was dropped & might have actually pissed off a lot ""Batman"" fans. Basically, it's a chase sequence with Batman chasing The Joker through the streets of Gotham City. The chase eventually leads to a circus, The Flying Graysons, & the origin of Robin. I, personally, thought this sequence was overkill & makes you question did the filmakers need to have the Joker be responsible for both the origins of Batman & Robin?

Prince's music videos - yup. Oversexed & silly even for it's time. I couldn't even sit through watching ""Batdance"". Prince is O.K., but, can you really take a man seriously when he's dressed as half-bat, half-clown? I call it half-as*ed.

""Batman Returns""
- Disc 1: Feature film & theatrical trailer (yeah, just one)
- Disc 2: ""The Bat, The Cat, & The Penguin"" - original CBS special shown with a repeat showing of ""Batman"" in June of 1992, a couple of weeks before the release of ""Batman Returns"". Robert Urich hosts & its pretty cheesy in some areas.

""Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight"" Part 4 - decent chronicle of the history of ""Batman Returns"". There is a big problem, however, with the interviews. All of the Michael Keaton, & some of the Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito interviews are rehashed from the CBS special, & its like watching pete & repeat. Nothing has been changed. My advice watch this first then go to the CBS special. Trust me on this one.

Heroes & Villians - profile of main characters

Beyond Batman Doc Gallery - behind the scenes look to ""Batman Returns""

Siouxe & The Banshees ""Face to Face"" music video - ever wonder what happened to this group? Watch this video & wonder no more.

""Batman Forever""
- Disc 1: Feature film & wow!...,  1 trailer
- Disc 2: ""Riddle Me This - Why Is Batman Forever?"" - CBS special that was broadcast with ""Batman Returns"" in June 1995, a couple of weeks before the theatrical release of ""Batman Forever"". Chris O'Donnell hosts & asks the question: Do you like your cheese grilled or with a slice of tomato? Taste the cheese.

""Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight"" Part 5 - everthing you need to know about ""Batman Forever"" & the rumors & gossip surrounding the film are debunked right here. Great stuff.

Beyond Batman Doc Gallery - a look at the making of the film. Just like the first two films.

Deleted Scenes (!) - Holy cutting room floor, Batman!
alternate beginning (Two-Face escapes Arkham Asylum. ""The Bat Must Die!"" in blood on his cell wall), Bruce Wayne faces his fear in the bat-cave, are a few of the deleted scenes. Pretty cool, overall.

Seal, ""Kiss From A Rose"" video - classic video from the film, but where the hell's the ""U2"" video!?

""Batman & Robin""
- Disc 1: Feature film (sheer toy-ettic torture) & trailer
- Disc 2: ""Shadows Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight"" Part 5 - YES!!! Joel Schumacher finally apoligizes for making this film!!(my soul reason in buying this box set was to see what was going to be said about this fourth film)

""Warner Brothers"" wanted a more family inspired film, with lots of toys for the kiddies.

With the film being rushed into production & the emphasis, from toymaker Kenner, for more characters & vehicles to be ""toy-ettic"" (so they can make massive amounts of money off the toys, even if the movie sucks, which it does) ""Batman & Robin"" was doomed from the starting gate.
Why didn't Schumacher bow out of the project if he knew it was gonna suck?
Even after all this I still find the film painful to watch.
Chris O'Donnell adds: ""Batman Forever"" felt like we were making a film. ""Batman & Robin"" felt soft, like making a toy commercial.""

Deleted scene - Alfred's lost love. Ho-hum.

Batman doc gallery - behind the scenes of ""Batman & Robin""

four music videos - they all suck. Believe me.

Overall, this is a great set & is worth getting, for the right price that is. This isn't the last definitive set for the ""Batman"" films. ""Batman Begins"" isn't included in this set, but, it seems like the franchise has been revived with the latest film & hopefully won't fall to the trappings of ""Batman & Robin"".
Either way Batman is forever.",1130198400,93,6353,4.508710801393728
919452,5,6304613113,"Unlike really super-duper powered up Superman with his 10 abilities(exaggerating but who knows), Batman has no abilities. In fact, the only ability he does have is probably resources. The money to be able to be a crime-fighter. Unlike his other DC comics compatriots, and even the Marvel fellas, Batman has to do something in order to be a super hero rather than the Flash running like hell at will. Just one of many struggles for Bruce Wayne. In film form, he's just as good as those superheroes but film adaptations can be tricky, like the last 2 entries in this set prove. For this review, instead of reviewing each DVD seperately, I'll just put all movie reviews here.

Batman: Directed by Tim Burton and it's one of the better entries in this set. Batman was supposed to be a more darker comic book but having very colorful comics and the cheesy 1960's show didn't help much. This film sets the tone right like Frank Miller's books. Jack Nicholson does a good Joker but anyone who's seen the animated series knows Mark Hamill(yes, the Skywalker fella) does an even better Joker. Why? Because Joker is supposed to be disturbing, like a guy who finds it funny when you fall down a stairs. Here, Nicholson is more like a prankster. Michael Keaton is a good Batman, just not Bruce Wayne. He doesn't have that troubled side that he should have. The rest are fine with, to me, a mention to Michael Gough, perfectly capturing that grandfatherly aspect of the Alfred character. Michael Caine from Begins is almost too ""good uncle"" like. Pacing may be off but it's a fine first entry for the Dark Knight. 8/10

Batman Returns: 3 years later, same director and it's better. Here we introduce Catwoman and Penguin, played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito respectively. Michelle has the perfect tone of sexiness and ice-coldness, and slight warmth. And of course Danny is just as nasty and awesome. Mention also goes to Christopher Walken, playing corporate bad guy Shreck. <Walken accent>He delivers his lines with gusto and strength. The story's better, more time on the villains, set pieces are better and even though financially is wasn't, this to me is #1 Batman film, battling Begins. 9/10

Batman Forever: Gone is Tim Burton from the director's chair, in comes Joel Schumacher. First, the shift is extremely noticeable. While Burton matched the tone, it's almost like they tried to fuse the campiness from the 60's show with the gothicness of the previous 2 films. What we have is a film with neon face paint, bat nipples, and slight awfulness. Two-Face, which has potential of being the most complicated Rogue in the gallery, here he's actually more better Joker than Nicholson, being very upbeat and loving being bad. Jim Carrey essentially is like the prankster aspect of Joker amped up. New Batman Val Kilmer actually does the opposite of Michael Keaton: he has the perfect balance of troubled man but doesn't have the Batman tone down. This film like popcorn will fulfill its need but just not very effectively.

Batman and Robin: To paraphrase Treebeard from the Two Towers, there isn't a curse in dwarf, elvish or the tongue of Man that could explain the travesty that is Batman and Robin. Everything about this just screams awful. First? Well bad Mr. Freeze puns. Almost everything he says is some witty remark involving ice or cold or snow or anything cold. Then we have Bane, the character that actually broke Batman's will and spirit, not to mention his back in the comic books, ends up being ""dumb goon"". Then we have extreme campiness. Hated the bat nipples? Well how about on Batgirl's too? Or the Batman credit card? Or the changing of Barbara from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece? I could go on and on because quite frankly, it's fun. There's so much to hate you can practically be giddy as you tear it down. This film is essential watching for aspiring filmmakers? Why? Well it's a lesson on how NOT to make a film, especially a franchise entry.

Extras for each film is pretty much the same thing: a StarTV style behind the scenes, an entry into the multi-part Shadows of the Bat documentary, a feature on the making of the respective film with Beyond Batman, music videos and sometimes deleted scenes. The big highlight is the 6 part documentary Shadows of the Bat, chronicling the Caped Crusader's journey onto the big screen. It's probably on par with the Empire of Dreams documentary from the Star Wars set.

So there it is. 2 great films, one average film, and one film that proves sometimes making money is the only goal, not art. If you're at all into Batman or comic books or even action movies, get them. I'd warn you: the last 2 are quite bad but watch them so you'll know never to watch them again.",1130112000,2,4749,4.73639661426844
919453,4,6304613113,"There's quite a few good extras. I especially like the Shadows of the Bat documentaries, and also the history of Batman feature. It's nice to see comments on the characters by folks like Dennis O'Neill, Frank Miller and Paul Dini.

 It's a bit interesting to see some of the DC Comics enforced restrictions. For example, they talk about Dr. Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent book quite a bit, but neglect to mention the most Batman-specific factoid, that Wertham claimed Batman and Robin were gay. Bill Finger gets copious mentions, but you still couldn't get a sense of how much of the Batman mythos that he and Jerry Robinson created. (For example, it's stated that they came along later, even though Finger wrote Batman's first apperance.) It's corporate policy that Bob Kane created everything and that the others merely helped.

  The abannoned Robin sequence from the first film is interesting, and I like that they got the definitive animated voices to read the script over the storyboards.

  As for the movies themselves, watching it, I really enjoyed seeing the first two Batman films again. They have their flaws, but there's still a strong artistic sense to them. Tim Burton wasn't trying to create toy commercials.

  As for the last two, well... it bugs the hell out of me that Joel Schumacher keeps excusing every story problem, every bit of dopey dialogue as ""it's a comic book"" or ""it's a cartoon"". Schumacher, people who do comic book movies should actually respect the artform. They should work to bring out the strengths of comics, not replicate the weaknesses of the worst examples of the medium. The director's poor attitude realls explains all the problems of those movies.

  But this boxed set is cheap enough that the last two films can be counted as extras to the first two. If you can spare about 10 dollars for the sake of completeness, then it's worth getting this anthology set.",1130025600,5,1911,4.8580246913580245

919455,5,6304613113,"This review is for the ""Batman Anthology"" set, where each movie is packaged in a new, 2-disc special edition. There is also an older, ""Batman Legacy"" set with the bare-bones editions, and Amazon seems to be grouping the two reviews together.

It's about time that Warner Home Video has finally given these superhero films the two disc, special-edition treatment they deserve. Each film comes with restored/enhanced video and audio, and all the special features one expects from a current dvd release these days; we get commentaries, archival music videos and trailers, making-of featurettes, interviews, retrospectives, and deleted scenes. The last bit will be of special interest to some fans, especially because the Batman Forever DVD finally includes those missing sequences we saw in the storybooks and trading cards (though they appear here in rough form). Also of interest to fans of the animated series is the abandoned ""Robin sequence"" from the original movie, where they got Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil to bring the storyboards to life. Overall the special features are excellent, and these special editions are not a cheap double-dip.

The big question is if you should shell out for the box set, which includes the generally reviled ""Batman and Robin."" Personally I completely love the first three movies, and since the box set is about the price of buying them seperately or even cheaper, I'd say go for it. The Batman and Robin edition has enough special features to be worth the investment, and besides that the complete box set just looks nicer on my shelf. If you only like two of the four movies, it's a harder decision. If you can guarantee to yourself that you'll never be tempted to pick up more than two of the films, grab them individually. But if you're a collector who might eventually cave-in and get the others for completion's sake, the best bet is to buy the box set now.

Either way, it's nice to finally own these films with all the trimmings.",1129680000,103,1973,4.901197604790419

As with most people, I loved the first two films and could easily have done without the latter two.  However, seeing the features that all the films in this set were going to have, I purchased the entire thing and I'm glad I did.

The commentary on all films is entertaining and informative and it even makes it bearable to make through Shumacher's follies.  The real treat lies with the documentaries however.  Tons of interviews with many people involved, wonderful insight, and a whole new perspective on all the movies.

This is a set that I have been hoping would come along for many years and it hasn't disappointed.  This is a must for all Bat-Film lovers.",1129593600,4,729,4.561538461538461

So thats probably my favorite. Forever was ok. I did enjoy Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey, as Two-Face, and The Riddler respectively, but Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all time! Not Val Kilmer, and certainly not George Clooney. But the 5 stars are for the first two alone. I bought only the first two,not the box set, but the first two alone warrant the 5 star rating I think. Michael Keaton the best!",1129593600,,580,4.330275229357798
919459,1,6304613113,"The only old Batman movie that was remotely decent was the first Batman, but Jack played a horrible Joker. I mean Tommy Lee Jones played a better Joker than Jack Nicholson, too bad Jones was suppose to be playing Two-Face, a guy that was suppose to be calm and collective in his plan not a silly clown killing people randomly. I don't really have a comment on the Pengiun played by Devito. I never really liked the character to begin with.

And then it goes straight down from there. Batman Returns was horrible, and it doesn't take a comic fan to see it. Penguins with friggin missiles on their back? WTF?!

And the number one thing I really hated was Burton's Batman loved to kill. The thing that makes Batman what he is is that he does not kill, he does not sink to the level of the criminals. There was one scene where a thug threw a grenade at Bats and Bats kicked it back to him. And to top it all off, Bats SMILED as if he were a psychopath! WTF?

And then there's the neon lights in Forever and Robin and the worst acting possible. Arnold as Freeze is the worst casting decision I have ever seen. What the heck was Schumacher thinking?",1129593600,8,1143,4.282407407407407

919572,3,6304613113,"Compiling the first four Batman films, which as a previous reviewer noted both helped resurrect comic to film adaptations and nearly kill them as well, the Batman Anthology is better left on the shelf and the Special Editions of the first two films are the only ones worth purchasing.  The first film, released in 1989 and directed by Tim Burton, cast Michael Keaton as a brooding Dark Knight trying to save Gotham City from the diabolical Joker (Jack Nicholson) while wooing reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger).  This first film was revolutionary in it's tone and delivery when first released, and it hasn't aged very well, but the page it takes out of Frank Miller's classic Dark Knight Returns helps seperate it from the campy television series, which is why it became the blockbuster it did.  Nicholson was perfectly cast as the Joker, and his performance will go down in history as one of, if not the, best comic book villains of all time.  The second film, Batman Returns, was released in 1992 with Burton in the director's chair again and Keaton reprising his role and this time taking on the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the sexy Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) as well as a crooked mayor (Christopher Walken).  Batman Returns was one of the few super hero sequels that managed to successfully capture the spirit of the first film, and be it's equal as well.  The third film, Batman Forever, saw Joel Schumacher take over as director, and Val Kilmer dawning the cape & cowl this time around to take on the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (an overacting Tommy Lee Jones).  Bats is also joined for the first time by Robin (Chris O'Donnell) as he woos the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).  This film was a split between critics and fans alike, as the dark tone is pretty much gone and replaced by an uber-campiness, but it's nowhere near as bad as what would follow it.  1997' Batman & Robin is arguably the worst comic to film adaptation of all time, with Schumacher back at the helm and the miscasting of George Clooney as Batman, with Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.  They take on Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), but before you get to that point you'll be wondering how this piece of crud ever got greenlit.  Each film has been re-released in Two-Disc Special Editions with an assortment of extras, but this box set features no exclusive features itself.  If you're a Bat-fan, then you already know to skip this set and just buy the first two (and maybe the third depending on how much you liked it) instead of getting this.",1129334400,62,2613,4.743929359823399
919573,3,6304613113,"The secretive & masked superhero character Batman (initially named Birdman) was first created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger for the comic book company known as ""Detective Comics"" (or DC Comics) back in May, 1939; and has remained a very popular comic book superhero ever since.  The popularity of the character inspired the production of a live-action big-screen film in 1989.  Simply entitled ""Batman"", it was directed by the well-known Tim Burton.  To play the leading role of Batman, whose unmasked identity is millionaire Bruce Wayne, was actor Michael Keaton.  Battling Batman during this first film was his arch nemesis the Joker, who was once the man named Jack Napier (Jack Nickolson).  Determined to take over the fictitious metropolis of Gotham City, the Joker wreaks havoc as he takes over full control of the criminal underworld.  Powerless to defeat the Joker, Gotham City Police Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) must put his trust into the caped & masked Dark Knight known as Batman to stop the Joker once and for all.

Using a mix of dark cinematography, good special effects and reasonable acting, the 1989 ""Batman"" was a relatively good film that I would rate with 4 out of 5 stars.  Three years later in 1992, Michael Keaton again played the Caped Crusader Batman in the next Batman film entitled ""Batman Returns"".  With the Joker safely imprisoned, Gotham City's underworld is ripe for being taken over once again by another deadly criminal, this time in the form of the disfigured man who becomes known as the Penguin (Danny DeVito).  Again directed by Tim Burton, ""Batman Returns"" was even darker than the first, but allowed Batman to fall in love with a woman named Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) that decides to become the masked criminal known as Catwoman after being pushed out of a window and aided by alley cats.  Between Penguin's bomb-carrying penguins and the obsessive love/hate relationship that develops between Batman and Catwoman, Batman again has his hands full in trying to keep the citizens of Gotham City safe.  Overall, I rate the sequel ""Batman Returns"" with 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Three years later in 1995, Joel Schumacher was given the opportunity to direct the third Batman film.  Entitled ""Batman Forever"", the Caped Crusader/millionaire Bruce Wayne was played by Val Kilmer instead of Michael Keaton.  This film begins at a circus' (owned by Bruce Wayne) performance in Gotham City, but it is disrupted by the evil villain known as Harvey Two-face, who was once a police detective named Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones) that turned to evil following a disfiguring chemical accident.  Unfortunately, the attack by Two-face occurs while the famed Grayson family is performing their trapeze act.  Three of them are killed, but one survived: the young Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell). Feeling responsible, Bruce takes Dick under his wing, but Dick doesn't want to stay there until Bruce shows Dick his huge collection of motorcycles.  In the meantime, one of Wayne Enterprises' employees, Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), becomes increasingly delusional and transforms himself into the villain the Riddler.  Using a sophisticated device of his own design that allows him to send and receive thoughts directly from people's minds, the Riddler joins Two-face in an effort to control Gotham City and destroy Batman; but this time, Batman is not alone.  Begrudgingly, Batman accepts a partner: Dick Grayson as his faithful sidekick Robin (at the urging of Bruce's long-time butler Alfred, played by Michael Gough).

Though not as well-received as the first two Batman films, I rate ""Batman Forever"" with a respectable 3.5 out of 5 stars.  However, few people (including myself) found the fourth Batman film in any way entertaining.  In 1997, again under the direction of Joel Schumacher, Batman (this time played by George Clooney) and his sidekick Robin (Chris O'Donnel) must fight two new villains: the evil Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) who becomes the evil nature-loving Poison Ivy in the film ""Batman & Robin"".  This time, though, Batman & Robin have another helper: Commissioner Gordon's niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) who puts on a mask of her own to become Batgirl.  Unfortunately, with a mixture of terrible acting, poor direction, bad writing and a too-comical appearance, ""Batman & Robin"" was a truly awful film that earned a 1 out of 5 star rating in my book.

Hence, for the first four Batman films, I give a combined average rating of 3 out of 5 stars. If you are a true Batman aficionado, this is truly a good set of DVD's for you to own; but in my book, the best Batman film to date is the 2005 ""Batman Begins"", which is not part of this four-film set.",1129334400,2,4759,5.00761421319797
919574,5,6304613113,"The story of the Dark Knight detective known as Batman is a story that most people are familiar with.  How Bruce Wayne as a child witnessed the murder of his parents by a common street thug.  After the murder, the criminal was never apprehended and brought to justice, a fact which drove Bruce Wayne to hone his body in the various martial arts, sharpen his mind to become the world's greatest detective, and eventually take on the role of vigilante, by taking the form of a bat to strike fear into the hearts and minds of criminals within Gotham City.  In the 1960's DC Comics and Warner Brothers allowed the `Caped Crusader' to be adapted into a weekly television series, starring Adam West (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and Burt Ward (Dick Grayson/Robin).  The problem with this series is that it chose to make a comedy out of Batman, everything about this series screamed camp!  The series eventually ended, but that would not be the end of Batman's life on TV, after that he appeared in animated form on the kid-friendly ""Super Friends"" show, which was basically the Justice League team without the name.  Eventually, ""Super Friends"" ended, and once again Batman was left to only appear in the comics.

In 1989, Warner Brothers felt the time was right to begin a film franchise based on the Dark Knight, but without all the camp of the TV series.  Helmed by director Tim Burton, and starring Michael Keaton (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), and Jack Nicholson (Jack Napier/Joker), ""Batman"" gave the caped crusader the proper treatment he deserved.  Gone was the camp, and in was the dark, brooding, and vengeful billionare Bruce Wayne who prowls the rooftops of Gotham City in the guise of Batman, stopping evil wherever it may reside.  With huge critical and commercial success, it was official that Batman was a hot commodity and that a franchise was born.  The thing about this franchise is that Warner Brothers established the movie version of Batman, at least initially, as a brooding hero, as he has always been depicted in the comics.  However, over the span of the four movies that comprise the original `Batman' franchise, the hero went from brooding and dark to light, family fun and camp, much like the old TV show.  Though I have problems with the direction this franchise took, I must admit I still enjoy watching the movies, even my least favorite installment, ""Batman & Robin"" (the 4th film in the franchise).  Even with the decline of the franchise with the last installment, it is still one of the most successful film franchises of all time, and with the release of ""Batman Begins"", it appears that a new franchise has begun for the Dark Knight.  Now that I've given the history lesson for the day, it's time to move on to the plot synopsis' for each of the 4 movies, and my review for ""Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology"" collection.

""Batman"" was basically the origin story for Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton), but also served as the origin for Batman's greatest villain the Joker (Jack Nicholson).  Unlike most origin films where it takes forever for the hero to take on the role he is destined for, and we see the hero's progression in chronological order, director Tim Burton chose to start the movie out with Bruce Wayne already in the role of Batman.  The origins of Batman are shown in flashbacks, however the origin for the Joker is not handled in flashbacks, but rather as a plot point in the film's basic plot.  An interesting approach on the part of Tim Burton was to have Batman not be instantly trusted by Gotham City, and have the citizens and law enforcement in the city be torn over who they should trust, the dark and brooding, mysterious hero Batman, or the fun-loving, camera-friendly Joker.  Can Batman overcome the mistrust of the citizen's of Gotham City and stop the Joker's insidious plot before it's too late, or will he and his beloved city fall prey to the self-proclaimed `Clown Prince of Crime'?

""Batman Returns"" picks up sometime after the events of ""Batman"", Gotham City survived the evil of the maniacal Joker, and Batman (Michael Keaton) has earned Gotham City's trust as their protector against the forces of evil.  But, as the Christmas season approaches in Gotham City, a crazed group of psychotic circus characters begins to terrorize Gotham, but as Batman is battling to protect Gotham City, a seemingly new hero emerges, who goes by the name of Penguin (Danny DeVito).  The crazy circus and this new `hero', the Penguin, aren't the only concerns for Batman, as he begins a new relationship with a woman named Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer).  However, a peaceful, loving relationship is not for Bruce Wayne, as Selina is not exactly what she seems, she is also the thief who goes by the name Catwoman.  As if all of these problems weren't enough, the Penguin turns out to be evil, and is leading the crazed circus group, and Catwoman joins forces with him to bring down the Dark Knight by framing him for murder, so that they may rule Gotham City.

""Batman Forever"" begins to show the signs of the `Batman' franchise changing direction from the darker tone of ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", and into more lighter, family friendly territory.  The story picks up in what appears to be several years after the events of the first 2 films in the franchise, and Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer taking over for Michael Keaton) is being plagued by nightmares of his parent's deaths.  But the nightmares are starting to manifest themselves while he is awake, which causes him to seek the aid of a psychiatrist named Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), who just so happens to be fascinated by Batman, who unknown to her is the alter-ego of her newest patient.  As Bruce Wayne tries to push the nightmares away, the villainous Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and his gang are ransacking Gotham City's banks and jewelry stores.  At the same time a former Wayne Enterprises employee named Edward Nigma (Jim Carrey) has become obsessed with murdering his former boss Bruce Wayne, but not before tormenting him with mind games as the Riddler.  Separately Two-Face and the Riddler are threatening enough, but the stakes are raised when the two join forces in an attempt to take over the minds of Gotham City's citizens.

""Batman & Robin"", the second `Batman' film to be directed by Joel Shumacher (""Batman Forever"" and ""A Time to Kill""), marks the end of the first `Batman' franchise and serves as the prime reason why there was an 8 year span where Batman was absent from the big screen.  This film finds Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) joining forces to fight the evil of Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and her bodyguard Bane.  As if three villains weren't enough for the dynamic duo to contend with, they learn that Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying of a rare disease with no cure.  To stop these three villains, while at the same time trying to save Alfred, two heroes will not be enough; enter the newest member to the `bat-family', Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone).  To save Gotham City this battered and broken trio of heroes must rise up, put their differences aside, and show that nothing is stronger than the bonds of a family.

As one of the most successful movie franchises that helped resurrect the comic-book movie genre and almost kill it over the span of 4 movies, it serves as prime example of both how to and how not to make a franchise.  With the first 3 films, Warner Brothers showed that they knew how to handle a gigantic superhero franchise, but just like how Warner Brothers managed to destroy the `Superman' franchise, it wasn't long before a couple of stupid decisions would bury the `Batman' franchise as well.  The first 2 films directed by Tim Burton, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" kept the darker tone of the comics intact and delivered fairly accurate representations of what Batman is all about.  The 3rd installment in the franchise, ""Batman Forever"" directed by Joel Shumacher and featuring Val Kilmer as Batman and introducing a new interpretation of Robin to moviegoers, began to show signs of trouble for this franchise.  As the darker tones and more realistic landscapes were slowly being replaced by more comedy and outlandish set pieces, and not to mention the problem of nipples on the batsuit.  Even with these foreboding signs, ""Batman Forever"" was still a terrific entry into the franchise, but with the 4th film, ""Batman & Robin"", Warner Brothers allowed Joel Shumacher too much freedom and the franchise suffered because of it.  It didn't help matters that casting was another problem with ""Batman & Robin"" with George Clooney filling the batsuit and Arnold Schwarzenegger portraying Mr. Freeze.  Clooney wasn't a bad Batman, but it would have been nice to see Val Kilmer stick around for more than just one film, although truth be told, Michael Keaton should have stayed through the entire franchise.  But Arnold Schwarzenegger should have never been cast as Mr. Freeze, in the comics Mr. Freeze was a skinny, scienctist who dabbled in suspended animation in hopes of curing his dying wife Nora of a rare disease, Arnold just did not fit the part.  However, even with my gripes regarding ""Batman & Robin"" there were several good things about the movie, the addition of Batgirl was a nice touch, although she was the daughter of Commissioner Gordon in the comics, not Alfred's niece, and having Alfred dying of the same rare disease as Mr. Freeze's wife was a nice twist.

Overall, though the franchise took a bad turn at the end, the series as a whole is enjoyable, and thanks to the huge success of ""Batman Begins"" a new `Batman' franchise is born, and the original franchise finally gets the DVD treatment it deserves with 2-disc special editions, jam-packed with extras for all of the fans out there.  Hopefully, Warner Brothers will be more successful with this new `Batman' franchise.

with that out of the way, i will say that i am EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEMYLY  excited to gfinally get the SE dvd's of the first 2 batman movies. screw schumacher and his 2 neon filled films, burton got it right and made some damn good batman films with interesting characters and stories that made you feel and think, and schumacher didnt. he REALLY didnt. end of story. so thats why i am only purchasing the first 2 Burton films, cuz when you compare schuamcher films to burton films...well.......do i really have to say anything? anyways, i was dissapointed for a long time with the original stupid empty shams of dvd's for BATMAN and Batman Returns, and im glad i decided not to buy them. my patience has finally been rewarded. Batman is my fav. superhero, hes real, human, and just plain cool.i saw Batman Begins, and while it was a good film, i still like burtons vision and films better. i just connect with it more, and the fact i grew up with these films, and that they are STILL my favorites and has the best action and characters ans stories, and a hell of alot more interesting and action packed then Batman Begins was, im just grateful for burton creating such vivid images and grandious sets and visuals and stories. thank you mr. Burton, God bless you.",1128038400,6,1279,4.556521739130435
919576,3,6304613113,"Those are the only two Batman movies which actually made the viewing audience want to see them (and the reason for the stars). Tim Burton took the time to understand his character.

As long as I live, I will never understand how DC Comics...etc thought that turning Bob Kane's classic avenger into a stand up comedian. It even makes the 1960's TV show look high brow by comparison.

What on earth is posessing Hollywood if they think the latter two train wrecks of film and sequins are even remotely up to par? Bless Michael Keaton for sitting out of the latter two films.

I'm unable to give this entire package higher than three stars because the studios intentionally tampered with a fan favirote.",1127952000,8,700,4.67479674796748
919577,5,6304613113,"Some fans of the Batman films will ask ""Why did we have to wait so so long for these to get the Special Edtion treatment?""  Well, that question had been burned into my skull until Warner Bros. released Christopher Nolan's incredible vision of Batman Begins.

When I heard that Batman Begins was finally being released, I finally knew that the Special Editions were coming sooner or later.  Being a big fan of Batman, I cannot wait for this set.

As far as special features go, I am more excited for the first film than anything.  I remember back in 1989 my mom told me I have to pick one super-hero and that's it.  I'm guessing that she wanted to make it easy on herself when it came to getting me toys, bedsheets, etc.  LOL.  The point is I picked Batman because he's not a super-hero at all.  He's a hero, plain and simple.  No super-powers, just gadgets and an awesome car.  As with the Joker, nobody else could've done it better than Jack Nicholson.  Superb.  I fell in love with the first film and have never seen any kind of making-of documentaries or anything.

""Batman Returns"" is also a great film too.  Batman belongs on the gothic side of things.  I mean, it is set in GOTHam City.  That is what Tim Burton did so well with this one.  Made it darker, like it should be.  Catwoman is probably my favorite villain of all and Michelle Pfeiffer pulled it off fantastically.  I'm really looking forward for the special features of this film too.

Then 1995 came along and ""Batman Forever"" flooded theater screens.  It's not my favorite of the Batman films but it was the one I was most excited for.  Jim Carrey IS The Riddler.  I would like anyone to prove me wrong.  I was somewhat dissapointed that Michael Keaton didn't come back but I don't blame him.  Val Kilmer was good anyway.

So, Joel Schumacher is a fantastic director with great movies under his belt like ""The Lost Boys"", ""Batman Forever"" and ""Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera"".  1997 was the year where practically in the blink of an eye, ""Batman & Robin came and went.  Because of the success of ""Batman Forever"", the hype was unbelieveable for this film.  However, Schumacher was able to take a franchise and give it corny lines, bad acting and bad....you know what?  Let's just leave it at that.  Thank god for Christopher Nolan reviving the series in a different light.

Overall, this set looks amazing.  Even though Batman & Robin was somewhat horrible, I will check out every little special feature in this set till the batteries in my remote goes dry.  The commentaries will be great and the making-of featurettes look interesting.  I haven't even held the box and I'm getting chills just thinking about it.  I highly, highly recommend this set for anyone who is a fan of Batman.",1127779200,4,2770,4.556910569105691
919578,5,6304613113,"I love all 4 of these movies (yes, even the fourth - I like campy, sue me). So I was very tempted to buy the Batman Legacy. However, after getting the Alien Legacy and then shelling out two years later for the Alien Quadrilogy box, I knew better. I knew that this Legacy would also eventually be made obsolete by some new uber-special-enhanced whatever box, so I did the smart thing and didn't buy the Batman Legacy. And now, after all this waiting, my patience is rewarded! True, this box set does follow Trek-box logic, meaning that it's just a compilation of individually released two-disc special editions, and contains nothing unique. But the same could be said of the Lord of the Rings uber-boxset, so this isn't exactly cause for complaint. And for those of you complaining about Batman begins... just remember that Begins is part of a NEW trilogy, which will have its OWN uber-boxset in a few years, and there's a very tiny chance that movies from the two distinct continuities will ever be mixed in one box.",1126915200,6,1016,4.65
919579,4,6304613113,"Batman Motion Picture Anthology has been in the works for over 5 years. Unlike Batman Legacy, a double dip worthless release of previous Batman DVDs, Anthology is all but an entirely new release.

With new technology, the video and audio should be better. Enhanced features and interviews with some of the actors should also increase the collection's desireability. However, if one does not care about the special features, then there is very little reason to purchase this collection.

This review is based more on special features, since most would agree the 89 movie is the best, Returns is next best, Forever is the beginning of the end, and the end is the beginning of 8 years of silence of Batman, for BM & Robin.

The interviews are plentiful in each volume. Having some of the actors and the directors give a commentary is great. I expect they will give their opinions on the new Batman Begins movie, and reminisce over troubles and fun times while they worked on their movie. Hopefully, Schumacher will apologize for reinventing Batman, and ultimately sabotaging the series. I'm sure his intent was not to ruin the series; but, at the same time, since he obviously is not a Bat-fan, should have gracefully declined the job. He should explain, as he did in previous commentaries, such as The Making of Batman & Robin, how he felt that Batman had whined long enough (50 years) over the death of his parents. So, he should explain why he set out to create an all new Batman.

There will be a few deleted scenes. However, this is where the company who actually puts the DVDs together, with their special features, ultimately lacks what it is the viewer really wants. Most special feature gurus want some commentaries, even a commentary over the movie is cool. But, 60000 hours of commentaries is excessive. A perfect special features disc will contain a voice over commentary during the movie; a commentary with the main actor, director and producer. Plentiful deleted scenes, and out-takes. In those movies that are high on special effects, a showing of how it was done is always interesting. Anthology focuses mostly on interviews and commentaries. Great; but, they lose major points by not offering enough deleted scenes, and out-takes.

Anthology is grouped as a box set of the former Batman movie franchise, or, wisely released individually, for those who despise any particular title. Anthology will not and does not contain the new Batman franchise, featuring Batman Begins, as this is part of a complete overhaul of the Batman Franchise. Thus, the name, Batman Begins. As such, they are completely seperate, and to include it in Anthology, would be incorrect.

Overall, Anthology should be what fans have been waiting for since the first Batman movie was released on DVD. I give it 4 of 5 stars, because it lacks the plentiful deleted scenes from each edition, but, packs in plenty of commentaries and interviews and other special features.",1126828800,2,2953,4.919678714859438
919655,5,6304613113,"I Can see so far from recent reviews that people are angry over the double dip boxset...but Why?? Don't get me wrong I do despise double dips but only when the movie studio does absolutely nothing to improve the quality or bonus features from the previous release, for example, Carlitos Way Ultimate edition, The transporter special delivery edition, Edwards scissor hands 15th anniversary edition. Meet the parents bonus edition, you get the idea. I mean when the first original Batman dvd box set came out in the late 90's i knew it was bound to be released because the quality wasn't that good, sound was medicore for an action flick, and there was no bonus features. I don't understand..How can you batman fans be surprised. Don't get me wrong i hate it when movie studios re-release a dvd to promote the new movie hence, Batman Begins, but this is a very legitimate release. Some Worthy double dips being released this year include Evil dead 2 limited edition book of the dead, The man who fell to Earth Criterion Collection, Mallrats extended anniversary edition....Here were getting 2-disc special editions for each movie not to mention enhanced picture and sound! To me that is a worthy double dip. If Warner Bros. re-released each Batman movie with only a deleted scene or a commentary then I can see the criticism. Double dips are annyoing and are very greedy, but theres nothing you can do about it just be smart about it and do more analyzing. And one more important note, I highly doubt Warner Bros. will be re-releasing another Box set of Batman containng Batman Begins. Batman Begins looks pretty stocked with special features not too mention a bare bones release at the sametime. Oh yeah one last final note....For people who are hesitate on re-buying the same dvd over and over again..go to a website [...] and go the category ""DOUBLE DIP DIGEST"" here you dvd fans will given a more detailed insight on whether or not to purchase a more recent edition of your favorite film. Trust me this site has helped me with my double dip temptations..>.!!!",1126656000,11,2062,4.778711484593837
919656,2,6304613113,"A couple of months ago I bought the box set of the first four Batman movies for the ridiculously low price of 21.98.  I couldn't believe how low the price was.  Well, now we know why.  They were simply trying to move out merchandise that will be obsolete beginning on Oct 28.

So, now that I have all four movies, am I going to be willing to shell out an addtional 50.00 to 75.00 dollars for these special editions?  In a word, no.  I'm sure a lot of Bat-geeks out there will, but I for one am not one of them.  What exactly am I getting?  Audio commentary and a few documentaries which I might watch once?  No thanks.  Improved picture and sound quality?  Negligible.  The pictiure and sound are good enough already.

And to be totally honest, all of the Batman movies (including ""Batman Begins"") were sort of a letdown for me.  The first and second films had great cinematography and acting, but the action scenes were not that strong.  In ""Batman"" it was never explained how the thugs got up on the roof of the cathedral in the last act.  That really annoyed me.  In ""Batman Returns"", the Penguin running for mayor, and the Penguin army with rocket launchers, and especially the penguin pall-bearers, was just stupid.  ""Batman Forever"" had terrible action scenes.  I couldn't even tell what was happening.  ""Batman and Robin""?  It was by far the worst (and gayest) super-hero movie of all time.  It made ""Mystery Men"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".  It was so monumentally bad that it simultaneously sunk the careers of Alicia Silverstone, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurmon (who later recovered), and even Arnold.  Why does Batman reveal his identity in EVERY FREAKING MOVIE???  Especially to his girlfriends?  Have you ever known a woman who could keep a secret?

...but I digress...

Warner Bros has simply learned the marketing ploy that's been mastered by George Lucas:  get geeks to buy the same movies over and over and over by promising something new, something they can't live without.  Does anyone really believe that in a year or two, ""The Star Wars Ultimate Edition 12 Disc Box Set, with Enhanced Enhanced Special Effects"" won't be hitting the market in time for Christmas""?

Did you notice that on Oct 28, ""Batman Begins"" will be released also, but it WON'T be included as part of this collection?  That's right kids, if you want all all 5 movies in one box set, your going to have to wait another year or two, when Warner will be releasing ""Batman: The Entire Saga So Far, Not Counting the New One"", perfectly timed to coincide with the release of ""Batman Continues...""",1126483200,8,2575,4.665924276169265

919658,3,6304613113,"It's certainly easy to slam WB, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher for their roles in the uneven film legacy being re-released here. With this summer's awesome ""Batman Begins"" providing a superior standard of measurement, these films seem to have gotten worse almost overnight. Most Bat-fans would probably rank these in descending order of release, with 1989's ""Batman"" the best of the bunch. The general opinion of ""Batman and Robin"" seems to get lower every year, yet there are many fans of the character that rank the macabre (and just plain weird) ""Batman Returns"" behind Schumacher's ""Batman Forever."" In truth, all of the films have striking visual sequences, which are often betrayed by narrative missteps and botched characterizations. Even ""Batman and Robin"" (stripped of its gay subtext, awful dialogue and total disregard for the history and dignity of the Batman universe) features a well-developed portrayal of the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Alfred that strikes several proper notes. If you have held off on buying the no-frills DVDs that have been available for years, then this set is worth the money. In my case, I have the well-worn VHS copies ready for retirement - tracking issues are already apparent in all four tapes. For several years my very young children have enjoyed the neon colors and goofy set-pieces that dominate the Schumacher films, and I am looking forward to Tim Burton's commentary on the first two movies. I have my doubts as to how revealing those commentaries will be, but I am very interested in finding out. I also hope that there is proper attention given to the artistic design of the first two films, especially the work of the late, brilliant Anton Furst in ""Batman."" A re-mastered digital soundtrack will also be a reminder of the evocative music, by both Danny Elfman and Elliott Goldenthal, that remains as perhaps the most accomplished aspect of the series.",1125446400,10,1914,5.060126582278481

Each movie has a commentary track with the respective director which includes Joel Schumacher, who despite directing one of the worst films of all-time, will hopefully make admends to the Bat-fans out there by explaining why he made Batman & Robin the way it was.

919663,3,6304613113,"NOTE - I won't take too much time to review the movies, because there are plenty of other reviews here to do that for you.

The first movie from 1989, ""Batman"", is considered by many to be the best superhero movie ever.  I agree except for ""Superman: The Movie"" and the new film ""Batman Begins.""  Jack Nicholson's turn as The Joker is classic, but many underestimate Michael Keaton's portrayal of a reclusive and enigmatic Bruce Wayne.  I'm told that this image is not true to the comics, but this approach fits very well with Tim Burton's dark vision of the comics.

The 1992 sequel, ""Batman Begins"" is a good follow-up.  The dark mood of Gotham City's Christmas is very intriguing to me.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer as Selene Kyle/Catwoman.  The Penguin is not very interesting to me, but Danny Devito kept my interest very well considering that I don't really like the character.  This movie excels with special effects and set design, but Bruce Wayne's character doesn't really change much.

Joel Schumacher took a stab in 1995's ""Batman Forever"", which reimagined Gotham City as a vibrant, neo-fantasy setting.  I love that visual style, as well as Elliot Goldenthal's musical score (even though Danny Elfman's for Tim Burton is timeless).  Val Kilmer is a good replacement, but my criticisms for the villains (Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler) are this...they're expertly-acted roles, but not expertly written.  Instead of being treated as lunatics, a more human approach to those two like Catwoman and The Joker received would've helped.  Still, a good action movie that introduces Robin (Chris O'Donnell is okay here guys, give him a break!)

I love the production design of 1997s ""Batman & Robin"", but the campy appraoch that mirrors the 1960s show was not the right way.  George Clooney doesn't offer much, even when Michael Gough's role as Alfred Pennyworth reaches out with more character than usual.  Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was a good idea, but the direction in which they took the movie's tone really hurt his potential.  The same goes for Robin (Chris O'Donnell) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman).  A lot of potential, but this was before superhero filmmakers understood that the characters needed to be taken seriously.  However, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl is atrocious.  That one I'll just have to deal with.

Okay then, so we get one great movie with two solid sequels, and a below-average finish.  However, I can't easily recommended this box-set because in October 2005, Warner Bros. released all four of these movies with tons of features.  As a result, these DVDs from the ""Minimalist Age"" are not going to be worth much.  The video and sound quality is solid in all of them, but the lack of Extras really devalues this box-set.  If you don't need Extras, then pick this collection up.  If you want grade-A DVD...pick up the ""Batman Anthology,"" which is a vastly superior package.",1123632000,4,2936,4.914634146341464

919744,4,6304613113,"I know I have already reviewed all four ""Batman"" movies individually, but I won't shy away from reviewing this boxed set containing all of them. I actually bought all the films in the boxed set rather than separately, but I decided to review them individually because I was too lazy to write a full review of the boxed set. Tonight, I feel like I'm able to write a thorough review of it, so here goes nothing.

""Batman"" (1989, PG-13) The first film in the series was directed by modern day cinema wizard Tim Burton. Michael Keaton takes on the role of the title character and his alter ego Bruce Wayne. In it, the Dark Knight is a vigilante hero out to thwart the criminals that plague Gotham City. The problem is, most of the citizens of Gotham think he's just as bad as the thugs he's beating up. However, their opinion changes when they get a load of the Joker (Jack Nicholson), aka former mobster Jack Napier. The Joker is out to poison Gotham City with his lethal Smilex gas, the same chemical that left him horribly disfigured in a duel with Batman. Meanwhile, Batman's alter ego, millionaire Bruce Wayne, is struggling with his secret life, which gets in the way of his blossoming relationship with beautiful photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), who The Joker also has his eye on. The plot may seem cluttered from a distant point of view, but all the elements mesh together perfectly and the film is excellent.

The cast is great. Keaton is the definitive Batman (slightly better than Christian Bale). A lot of people scoffed at him being cast for the role, but their opinion changed when they saw his brilliant performance. Kim Basinger wasn't amazing, but she put in a very good performance. And Jack Nicholson was excellent as The Joker. He doesn't carry the film or steal the show in any means whatsoever, but he portrays the character to the hilt but never overdoes it. This is truly one of his best roles ever. Add to that an outstanding supporting cast that includes Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance, as well as stunning special effects and visuals, and the series is off to a great start. 5/5

""Batman Returns"" (1992, PG-13) Three years after the successful first venture, Tim Burtons gets behind the camera again while Michael Keaton dons the cape and tights once more in this brilliant sequel, which is every bit as good as the original. In it, Batman has to face off with not one, not two but three villians. First, there's the Penguin (Danny DeVito), aka Oswald Cobblepot, a grotesque, birdlike man abandoned by his parents as an infant, who has teamed up with crooked businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Together, they plan to get Oswald elected mayor of Gotham and drain the city of its energy supply. And then there's Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former Selina Kyle, Shreck's secretary who he supposedly killed after finding out his plan. To make matters worse, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, and Selina have become romantically attracted to each other when they're beating the crap out of each other. This brilliantly written plot culminates in an unforgettable showdown with all four main characters.

The cast, like the last one, is flawless. Keaton is once again amazing as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He's even better here than in the first one. Michelle Pfeiffer sizzles as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, exuding sex appeal and putting on a showstopping performance. Danny DeVito was born to play The Penguin by physical features (well, height) alone. But his performance is so convincing that he could be seven feet tall and still put on a great performance. Christopher Walken is great as always. The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle and Michael Gough, who return to their respective roles (Commisioner Gordon and faithful Wayne butler Alfred), as well as cameos by Jan Hooks, Vincent Schiavelli and Paul Reubens that give this film extra kick. 5/5

""Batman Forever"" (1995, PG-13) All good thing must come to an end, and this film proves it. Keaton walked out of it after he was refused a larger salary, and Burton only co-produced this mess. The directing reins were handed over to veteran schlockmeister Joel Schumacher, who stripped away the first two films' gothic elements and turned Gotham City into Camp City. Val Kilmer takes on the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, and plays the role with about as much appeal as a city sidewalk. Nicole Kidman is very pretty but a stiff love interest, Tommy Lee Jones is a terrible Two-Face and Chris O'Donnell is woefully bad as Robin. Jim Carrey plays The Riddler and carries this film on his back. He is the only good actor in this film. Though a little over the top at times, the role is tailor made for him and he is the film's saving grace. 2/5

""Batman & Robin"" (1997, PG-13) I don't even want to go into  this mess. Read my individual review. 0/5

I see that the sales are this are quite strong right now, #300 out of all of the discs available on Amazon, probably because of the new Batman movie (which looks quite good).

There are rumors going around that Tim Burton recently recorded audio commentary on the first two films and it has been confirmed that Joel Schumacher is working on a restored director's cut of the third film, with many of the darker elements of the story that were deleted put back in. Obviously, then, we can be pretty sure that these films will come out quite soon with better treatment on DVD. This will probably coincide with the DVD release of Batman Begins late this fall.

1. Batman(1989)- After Beetlejuice, Burton and Keaton teamed up for Batman saga. Keaton as Batman.  It got the first Batman/Joker(Jack Nicholson) duel. Involving with Vicki Vale(Kim Bagniser). Great, Tim. 5/5

2. Batman Returns(1992)- Burton and Keaton are back. Keaton again as Batman. Bruce got interset with Selina Kyle, who is Catwoman(Michelle Pfeffier). Also team-up of Penguin(Danny Devito) and Max Shreck(Christopher Walken). Great, Tim. 5/5

3. Batman Forever(1995)- No Burton and Keaton team-up. Joel stepped in with Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnel as Robin. Team up of Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddlers(crazy-funny Jim Carrey). Hook up with this so-called doctor(Nicole Kidman). Didn't like Kilmer's characterize to Bruce. Setting of Gotham has change. What's up with this, Joel. 2/5

4. Batman & Robin(1997)- Joel returned with George Clooney as Batman, O'Donnel returns as Robin and an appeartance of Batgirl. Why she's Alfred's niece instead Gordon's daughter? Clooney was the worst. Teamed up of Freeze(Arnold the governor), Poison Ivy and an appearance of Bane. Parts of it was worst and the woman for Bruce, please. What were you thinking, Joel. 2/5

In my opinon, Selina is perfect for Bruce. The saga continues in 2005 with Batman Begins. It brings Scarecrow.",1116288000,6,1377,5.381395348837209

Jack Nicholson - no one could play the Joker any better IMO

Kim Basinger - so so performance(kind of bland)

Tim Burton - awesome director did Batman justice

overall I did not buy the relationship between Keaton and Basinger - to me they seemed mismatched - but overall one of the best superhero movies made to date.

(Batman Returns)

Michael Keaton and Tim Burton same as above

Michelle Pfeiffer - best Catwoman to date

Danny Devito - an unbelievably great Penguin

also one of the best superhero movies to date also better pairing Keaton with Pfeiffer than with Basinger IMO.

(Batman Forever) mediocre at best

Val Kilmer - even though he looks more like Batman than Clooney or Keaton- he gave a horrific performance. It seemed to me that everyone else in the movie was of a more upbeat tempo and pace and he was moving at a slow dark  pace. It was obvious to me how bad his performance was when minutes into the film I was wishing he was Keaton.

Nichole Kidman - not bad so so not much to say

Jim Carrey - good job in doing riddler - it was a little over the top - but still a good job

Tommy Lee Jones - a great job - although he played two face a little too dumb and easily manipulated for my taste

Chris O'Donnell - so so also not much to say - a little annoying

overall a completely different film than the first two and nowhere in the same league.

(Batman and Robin)

George Clooney - not Batman at all - he is a bad actor and does not look the part - nothing else to say

Chris O'Donnell - same as for Batman Forever except maybe even more annoying

Uma Thurman - not bad so so

The Terminator - not his best work (not that he has a best work he is not necessarily known for his acting)

May be the worst superhero film of all time up there with Hulk and Daredevil.

I think the last two movies in an attempt to seperate themselves from the first two went more with the cheese and less with the meat.

Personally, I would like to see someone cast in the roll who can give a Keaton like performance and actually look the part. So far Adam West has most looked the part and Michael Keaton has most acted the part.",1112486400,3,2229,4.212765957446808

919750,4,6304613113,"This DVD has the collection of the 4 major Batman feature films.

Batman(1989)- this is a great movie. Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as the Dark knight and Jack Nickelson is great as the Joker. Tim Burton directs beautifully, his dark style brings to life the darkness of the Batman legend. This film does a superb job of establishing Batman as a dark and very complex hero.  Also, Nickelson uses his dark comidic style to make the Joker an unforgetable villan. While not as great as Batman Returns, this first movie helps develop the Batman mythos that would result in Batmania. (9 of 10)

Batman Returns (1992)- This is the best superhero film of all time no matter what Spiderman 2 fans think.  This movie is extremely dark, which reflects the psyche of its characters.  Keaton is back as Batman and this time around does a better job of portraying both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego.  Michelle Pfiefer is amazing as the sexy Catwoman.  Her relationship with Batman is the most intriguing of any superhero genre film.  Danny is almost unrecognizable as the evil Penguin.  The movie establishes his story very effectively.  In addition, Tim Burton is back as director, and produces the best film of his career.  This film continues the dark style from the first movie and takes it much further exploring the psychology of each character.

As a side note did you know that Robin was written into the script of both Batman and Batman Returns, but was later dropped.  If you notice the Batman Returns action figures include Robin. (10 of 10)

Batman Forever (1995)- No Tim Burton and no Michael Keaton means close but no cigar.  This film lacks the gritiness of the earlier films.  Val Kilmer's Batman has no depth or complexity.  Carey and Jones are too over the top as the villans and Nicole Kidman plays a poor man's Vikki Vale.  Also, O'Donnell is much too old to play Robin. The writers should have made Robin a cool young sidekick like Tim Drake to contrast with Batman's dark side.  Finally, Schumacher was a horrendous pick as director. He does not have respect for the Batman mythos.  For example, near the end of the movie he makes sure too get good money shots of Batman's ass.  At best this movie can be considered mediocre. (5 of 10)

Batman and Robin(1997)- one of the worst films of all time.  Only a diehard Batman fan like myself can find enjoyment in the abomination.  Schumacher ruins the Batman series with his over the top style and with the castings of Clooney and O'Donnell.  Clooney, never that great an actor, is lost playing Batman and O'Donnell succeeds it making Robin seem like a Frisco citizen.  However, the worst things about this movie are that first Batgirl(Barbara Gordon) has suddenly become Barbara Wilson Alfred's niece and secondly a great character like Bane was underutilized as Ivey's brainless muscle.  This again shows utter disregard on the part of Schumacher for the history and mythos of the Batman character. (1 of 10)

I wish that Burton and Keaton would have taken part it all the Batman films.  Also, I would have liked that Catwoman had been saved for another Batman feature and not wasted on the awful Halle Berry flick.  Hopefully, Christian Bale can return Batman to his rightfull place as a dark and complex hero in Batman Begins.

919752,4,6304613113,"The Batman movies have always gotten mixed reviews. BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were mostly looked upon as being great yet too dark. BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN&ROBIN have received major mixed reviews with the fourth movie receiving most of the negative reviews. Well, here is my personal review of each film. BATMAN is just about perfect in every aspect. Great story, great acting, not childish, and a dark tone that suits the movie. BATMAN RETURNS to me ranks up with the first. The dark tone is a bit more emphasized but it doesn't ruin the movie at all in my opinion. The acting is good, especially  Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (hear her roar!) and the story holds up as well. BATMAN FOREVER is different from the first two in the sense of not having a very detailed story, a lighter tone, and of course the arrival of Robin. Though somewhat fast-paced, the story still is good and Val Kilmer did just as good of a job playing Batman as did Michael Keaton. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones bring so much personality to the characters of Riddler and Two Face. Aside from certain differences, this still ranks up with the first two movies. As for BATMAN&ROBIN, I realize that there were some noticable flaws. However, I have no problem overlooking them since I am a Batman fan. This movie is the first of the four to have a few plot holes but it's really not enough to ruin the overall film. A number of people hated George Clooney replacing Val Kilmer but again, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie because George did manage to do a decent job. Some situations were very predicatable and the villans acted a bit cartoony but being a fan of Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger I personaly enjoyed seeing them play the villans. BATMAN&ROBIN also brings about the character of Batgirl. Despite the flaws, this movie still manages to entertain just as the others. I would like there to be yet another sequel to the franchise though it probably won't happen due to the fourth Batman not doing so good at the box office. I think the reason that some were displeased with the last two Batman films is because the tone and style somewhat changed but overall a Batman fan should definately enjoy all four.",1103587200,3,2196,4.616368286445013
919753,3,6304613113,"........I never really liked any of these movies.  Even the Tim Burton 'masterpieces'.  In my opinion, the franchise started off kinda weak, then got progressively worse.  Of course, the Burton films are like Citizen Cain compared to the Schumacher efforts.

I give the first movie 3 stars for one scene and one scene only.  The scene wear Batman and Vicki Vale are driving back to the cave.  You can feel the uneasiness from Vicki as she nervously looks upon the stoic Batman.  Later, in the cave, Batman reveals the Joker's method for poisoning the masses.  This scene actually showed Batman as a detective which seemed to be lacking throughout most of the movie.  This is an aspect of his personality that both filmmakers unfortuantely neglected.  That's about it. The rest of the movie wasn't terrible but it just  didn't really do anything for me.  I can see, though, how so many people enjoy the Burton films.  Anyone who liked the Schumacher films, of course, should be downright ashamed of themselves.

With all that said.  I AM looking forward to this new Batman origin story, Batman Begins.  Why?  Well, Christopher Nolan is involved and if you've seen any of his three films you already know he's incapable of making a bad movie.  And by the look of the teaser trailer....this is going to have a very, very serious tone to it.",1097193600,,1337,4.739130434782608
919846,3,6304613113,"First of all I would like to point out the striking similarites between the Superman series and the Batman series, as it strengthens my following arguement. Both Superman and Batman had exceptional first movies, decent sequels (Though those penguins with missles on their backs really had my eyes rolling), and then two stupendously horrendous follow-ups. The third and fourth installments of both franchises are not even worth watching. I mean, Superman pitted against a supercomputer created by Richard Pryor, an intelligence-draining machine crafted by the Riddler, a ""Boy"" wonder who's almost 30, Superman splitting in two and fighting himself, three different actors playing the same role, people turning into plants, batgirl, completely inventing a new villian (Nuclear Man... ugh) rather than borrowing from the tried and true pantheon of the comic, nipples on a superhero's suit... the list of bad ideas goes on and on.

This leads me to my point. The studio (Warner Bros.) should have stopped after the second sequel for both franchises, but noooo, there was money to still be made, and even though the material was wearing thin they went ahead and made atrocious films that stole the glory from the originals. They were weakly written and weakly directed, mostly because it didn't matter anymore. The studio knew people would go to see the films based on the previous successes, and that my friends is the greatest attrocity inflicted upon the movie-viewing public. They think we are stupid. Superman III, Superman IV, Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin should have never been made.

Now, should you buy this collection or the Superman collection. That's up to you. You don't get any extras with this set and the Superman set's extras really aren't that great. You can purchase the movies separately. Batman, Batman Returns, Superman: The Movie, and Superman II are all great films. That is definately the route to go in my opinion.",1094169600,10,1944,5.129337539432177
919847,3,6304613113,"First of all, I want to say that the first two Batman films (Batman and Batman Returns) should be rated at a perfect 5 stars... but, Joel Schumucker (whatever his name is) single handly ruined this near perfect series.  It really probably started with the critics nick-picking at Batman Returns, claiming it was ""too dark"".  Though the first Batman is a classic and arguably the best, Batman Returns was on its level.  I think I'm brain washed to tell people ""the 1st one is the best"", but in reality watch the second way more.  I think I enjoyed images.  I think the 2nd movie had some real (super) artistic scenes, like when Penguin went to his parents grave site or when Batman and Penguin have a sick conversation in fron of Shreks Department store.  Again, both of these movies are hott to the point where you really don't even have to judge which one is better.  If you own one, you should own the other.

  Now, for the last two film (Batman Forever and Batman and Robin).  Wack.  Batman and Robin is one of the worst films ever made... period.  Everyone seems to agree on this, but everyone debates on whether Batman Forever was that bad.  Yes!!!  Batman and Robin takes the cake, but there were signs in Batman Forever to let you know what direction the new director was taking the films in.  The Director, Joel, figured Batman Forever worked so lets give them more it.  Batman Forever was colorful, so they added more colors in Batman and Robin.  The Successful Batman Forever added corny humor so the Director added even more corny humor.  There is a pattern here.  Val Kilmers Batman made a safe (being stolen by Helicopter) drop from the sky and land perfectly in place and everyone applauded.  Was I the only one that thought this was a bit corny and unrealistic... even for comic book film.  Do I even have to mention the ice skates in Batman and Robins boots in the last film.  I agree that some of the actors were off in these late two installments.  Val Kilmer was a bit dry, but to be honest with you I could of put up with it in a Tim Burton style movie.  Plus, he was cool looking in the suit compared to George Clooney.  Clooney looked like a guy at a hollween party with a Batman outfit on.  Clooney played Bruce Wayne extremely well... he acting was truly convincing, but his Batman was terrible.  Both of these actors failed to create two seperate characters for Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Kilmer was Batman even when he playing Bruce Wayne and Clooney was Bruce Wayne even when he was Playing Batman.  In the first films, Michael Keaton changed his voice, the way he walked, stood, everything.  It even looked like he held his mouth differently.  (side note:  even the cartoon Batman changes his voice between the two characters).  Why Joel failed to implement this?  Its hard for me to blame the actors... even though Mr. Freeze was a bit corny... it reminded me of Arnolds one liners in earlier films like Commando and Running Man.  No, I blame on the Director for how these movies came out.  Though he gave another reason for quitting, I think Michael Keaton left the series because he saw where things were going.  He had started production with Forever... fitted for the new Batman suit and everything.  Its hard to beleive that he would just up leave after deciding to start because he doesnt want be known for Batman forever.  I was a kid when these movies dropped, but even then I felt that he had quit because the script or the set (or something) was wack.

  Anywayz, Batman and Batman Returns are great films.  If you find the four pack for under thirty, why not buy it.  Other wise don't waist your money on this set.  You can buy the first two for fairly cheap and you will more than satisfied.  I gave this set a 3 rating due to the fact 1)The last two films are terrible and 2) There were no special features on these disc.  I bought Superman, which had at least one terrible movie in its set, but It was well worth my money due to the special features.",1093737600,2,3992,4.45643153526971
919848,5,6304613113,"This is a great buy! All four movies in this giftset except the last one, BATMAN AND ROBIN are execelent.

Batman (BATMAN 1) starring Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton is by far the best one. Loaded with action, supsense, and scenes that are a fest to the eye. It has perfect special effects, great diologue, the best villain, and great acting.

Batman Returns (BATMAN 2)starring Michael Keaton and Danny Devito. This also proves Michael Keaton and Tim Burton are geniuses. It has, again, great special effects, action, and another wonderful villains set, including the Penguin and Max Shreck. Michelle Phfeiffer is great and sexier than ever as michevious Catwoman, and this movie is definately the second best in the series.

Batman Forever (BATMAN 3) starring Val Kilmer and Jim Carrey. It was dissapointing to see Time burton go, but this movie is still just as great as the first two. The damsel, Nichol Kidman, is outstanding, even better than Kim Basigner and Michelle, (though they were great too). Jim Carrey is great as the riddler, and Tommee Lee Jones is the perfect sinsiter two-face. It has theb est special effects, but it does tend to go on too much about Bruce Wayne's parents' death.

Batman and Robin (BATMAN 4) starring George Clooney. This is great too, though the storyline is sort of dumb. It has great special effects, and has great acting, including Arnold (the governator) as Mr. Freeze, who is the perfect sinister villain. His ice blast effects are excelent, and Uma Thurman is hot and evil as plant girl Poison Ivy. With the introduction of wonderful Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) this movie is great!

So, there you have it. This collection is a great choice. And like I said, though the fourth was dissapointing, the other three movies are great!",1093651200,,1776,4.887043189368771
919849,5,6304613113,"Okay, for all those people who are wanting to know which of the four batman movies are the best. Well here is my two cents.
Batman#1- staring Michale Keaton as the dark night himself batman, Jack Nicolson as the dark comical feind joker,and Kim Basinger as the sexy Vicki Vale. This was a dark beginning for the series and it explained the troubles of Bruce Waynes two lives Billion Dollar buissness man, and the dark night. Michale Keaton played an awsome batman, his two attitudes as both characters Bruce Wayne and Batman never reveal that they are the same person. Jack Nicolson as the joker was pure brilliance. His facical expressions through out the movie and his remarks make him the number one batman movie villian. This movie was directed by the brilliant mind of Tim Burton.
Batman#2- Batman returns- staring- Michale Keaton returns as the role of Batman , Michelle Phieffer as the sly sexy Cat Woman, Danny DeVito as the sewer ridden Penguin, and Christopher Walken as the notorious Max Shreck. This movie was again directed by the brilliant mind of Tim Burton. This was the darkest of all four movies. It shows the trials and errors of masterminds against the dark knight. Danny DeVito played a spectacular role as penguin. He was definitly the man for the part. Michelle Phiffer as cat women was a great selection. Props on the skin tight body suite. This was another good movie from a good cast, and a great director. Until #3
Batman#3-Batman Forever- staring- Val Kilmer as Batman, Nichole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, Chris O'Donnelle as the boy wonder Robin, Tommy Lee Jones as the physcotic Two Face, and Jim Carrey as the clever Riddler. This was the worst of the 4. Jim Carrey played an awsome Riddler, Tommy Lee Jones played a fantastic two face. Nicole Kidman played a beautiful role as the sexy physco-therapist. But the other two was the downer. Starting with the least of the worst, Chris O'Donnell as robin. He was good in the beginning but as the movie progressed, his image slowly died out. Drew Barrymore played a quick role as one of two faces girls. But the number 1 reason for the faliure of this movie is the man himself Batman, played by a no personality Val Kilmer. Dont get me wrong Val is an awsome actor, but not for Batman. He had no personality, except when he tried to rival with Edward E. Nigma (The riddler for the non true batman fans) other than that he had no personatlity split between the two Bruce Wayne and Batman.
Batman#4-Batman and Robin- staring George Clooney as the role of Batman, Chris O'Donnell as the return role as Robin, Uma Thurman as the sensual Dr. Pamela Isley, also known as Poison Ivy, amd the governator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger as the bone chilling Mr. Freeze. This was an alright movie but not the best. Again the role of batman was trivialized by another actor. George Clooney as batman was good, on paper, but his performance was too wity for some. Again not seperating the lines between batman and Mr. Wayne.
So all in all the batman series is a definite DVD collection to have my ratings on the movies are.

919850,3,6304613113,"Whats there to say about these four movies? Plenty!
The first Batman stars ""Michael Keaton"" as Bruce Wayne A.K.A""Batman"" and Jack Nicolson as ""The Joker"" the plot evolves from the major crime boss of Gothem played by Jack Palance gets a little upset to find out one of his men is having an affair with his girl! So he sets him up to be captured by the police, only to have that man be accidently tossed over a rail into a batch of toxis waste and thought to be dead! But he's not, after he recovers and has some surgery he has become a new man, and calls himself ""The Joker"" and he takes over as the new crime boss of Gothem, and beeing ruthless he has sent out a mysterious virus that is killing people off slowly and Batman comes along to save the day, along the way there action, explosions , new gadgets and some cool effects! Kim Bassinger plays the leading lady and this movie is worth watching, its the best of what came out of these four movie....the first may not be the original, but its the original to this series of the Batman saga, and its the best of these four!
Batman returns has had alot of mixxed reviews. some like it, some dont! Me personally I don't think its a great movie! Batmans back and this time he has a new villian to deal with, a man who was abandend by his parents almost after birth and has been living in the seweres since .... and when he emerges he has become the golden boy of gothem, suckering people into making him beleive hes a good guy. That man is the Penguin played by Danny Devito! Batman knows he's dirty and sets out to proove it! Also Michelle Pheifer plays the Catwoman, many i think liked the film because of seeing her in a tight costume, seeing as how sex doesnt sell in my book, it may be why i don't see this film as beeing any good! Also stars ""Christpher Walkin"" he plays a wealthy buisness man who is not a nice man, and with such scum running around gothem, Batman is there to try and save the day once again from the crime around gothem!
Batman Forever I would bet money on is in any ones top 10 worst movies of all time list! This movie starred a new leading man for Batman ""Val Kilmer"" as Batman and also bringing in the new villians of The Riddler (Jim Carey) and Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the new leading lady is played by barf girl (Nicole Kidman) even with a cast like that this movie failed! Its plot is bad, the whole serisness and almost beleiable first two movies have just completly taken a 180 turn and gone into a stupid comic book looking city with some of THE worst acting of all time! The only actor who played a decent role was the other new comer to the series Robin (Chris O'donnel)
Batman & Robin introduces ""George Clooney"" as Batman, Chris O'donnel returns as Robin, and introduces Alicia Silverstone to play Bat Girl.... two new villians have emerged in Gothem , Mr. Freeze (Arnold Shwartzenegger) and Posion Ivy (Uma Thermon) this movie was a bit better then the last one, but Arnolds acting is by far some of his worst! And Uma's parading around in tights trying to sell a sexy image does not do it for me! George Clooney IMO did not play that bad a role as Batman, he is certinlly better then Val Kilmer, but no where near as good as Keaton!
Final Advice on these movies
1 - Good, well worth watching ***** five stars!
2 - Eh, wasn't as good as the first **** four stars
3 - ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! / Zero Stars
4 - An improvment on the last, but not good enough *** 3 stars!
My advice is to buy only the first one and maybe the second one if you liked it! But if you buy Batman Forever, you will make one of the worst purchases of all time! You will regret it! And the 4th isn't really worth having...if you get a great deal on all four, then go for it, but IMO part one and two is the only ones worth getting!
The worst downfall to ALL of these movies, is not one of them comes with any bonus features!!!! I remember heaps of stuff that was around when all 4 of these films where made, starting with the trailer to the first movie ""a man in black"" and its very disapointing that they neglect some of the biggest movies of all time like this!",1079827200,4,4145,4.1825

Some of these films can be dark sometimes but they will always remain entertaining.  Michael Keaton is the best actor for Batman.  George Clooney is a great actor but he wasn't too good as Batman and Val Kilmer was almost as good Michael.  If they ever did make a 5th Batman movie, they should use Michael Keaton, even thou he is getting quite old.  But who the hell cares.  These are great films that you could watch with your kids, just don't let kids under 5 watch the second one.  It is a bit too dark for younger viewers.  But I'm sure you can let your kids under 5 watch the other ones.
Batman-This is the best one of the series of coarse and has the best bad guy, The Joker played by, who else but Jack Nicholson.  He's the only one who could have done the Joker.  This film isn't as dark as the others and is a great action film.
10/10
Rated PG-13 for violence, mild graphic violence, stylized action and some language.
Batman Returns-This is a great film and was one dark dark movie.  Danny DeVito was great as the Penguin and made it an enjoyable bad guy, not like alot of bad guys out there today.
Michael Keaton is Batman for the last time in this one.
8/10
Rated PG-13 for violence, dark humor, language, and stylized action.
Batman Forever-Val Kilmer should have been Batman is Batman and Robin.  He is almost as good as Keaton is.  This time the bad guys are The Riddler played by the one and only Jim Carrey, and Two Face as the great Tommy Lee Jones.  The thrid time around is great for most third sequels never really work out.
9/10
Rated PG-13 for violence, dark humor, and stylized action.
Batman and Robin-This is an ok entry in the Batman series but could have been much better.  I think Joel rushed through it to get it out as quick as possible.  George Clooney puts up an ok job as Batman and Arnold is awsome as Mr. Freeze.  And that's my opinian.
7/10
Rated PG-13 for violence and stylized action.
So all in all I would have to give this set a 9/10 and is well worth your money.",1079568000,,2159,4.262899262899263

Batman Returns,*****,The 1st best Batman movie ever,more darker,clever,scarier,funnier and has better special effects than the first,Batman most save Gotham City from two villians The Penguin and Catwoman. A good cast Michael Keaton,Michelle Pfeiffer,Danny DeVito,Michael Murphy,Christopher Walken,Paul Ruebens,Jan Hooks.
Batman Forever,**1\2,So-So Batman movie with new director Joel Shumacher and a new Batman played by Val Kilmer,also introduces two new villians Two-Face and The Riddler and Batman's partner Robin,Batman most save Gotham from Two-Face and The Riddler. Good special effects and cast but Tommy Lee Jones performance as Two-Face is his worst role ever and Jim Carrey as The Riddler really missed up as the villian,also Chris O' Donnell as Robin was so stupid.
Batman and Robin,0 stars,the worst Batman movie ever. Joel Shumacher really missed up this franchise,George Clooney as Bruce Wayne\Batman was terrible,while Chris O'Donnell as Robin is stupider than he was in FOREVER,Alicia Slverstone was awful as Batgirl,now villians Mr. Freeze played by Arnold Schwarzenegger was horrible and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy was horrible.a bad cast only special effects help.

919853,5,6304613113,"Now,I don't have this set sadly,but I own all four movies. The first film,Batman,is a terrific movie directed by Tim Burton and starring Kim Basinger,Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. The film won a Oscar for production design. The second best of the series.
The second film,Batman Returns,is also the darkest of the films. Tim Burton direct this one as well. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and does an even better job than he did in the first one. Christopher Walken,Michell Pfeifier,and Danny Devito costar in a film that is not as good as the first one,but is still pretty enjoyable. The worst of the series,but still enjoyable.
The Third Film ,Batman Forever, is lighter than the other two. In this one,Val kilmer plays Batman and is even better than Keaton,in my opinion. This time,Batman must battle the combined forces of the Riddler(an ohilarious Jim Carrey)and Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones)while trying to have a romatic relationship with Dr. Chase Meridan(NIcole Kidman).Robin also comes in this one and is played by Chris o'Donnel. The best of the films.
The fourth,Batman and Robin,may disapoint you,but it's still enjoyable. Mr. Freeze(Arnold Schwarzennegger),Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman),and Bane(Jeep Swenson),who combine forces to stop Batman and Robin. Batgirl also is in this in this one and is played by Alica Silverstone. This movie has amazing visual effects and action scenes. The third best of the series.
I hope my review help you. See these films if you you are a fan of Batman.",1066003200,6,1497,5.139344262295082
919854,4,6304613113,"I bought the dvd of the original Batman movie giving up hope that a better dvd would come out. Hell this one doesn't even have a trailer. Could use a commentary track by Tim Burton as well. Anyway doesn't look a special edition is being released anytime soon, god knows it deserves one.
  Now to the movies. Tim Burton directed Batman and Batman Returns and critics found the film too dark. Well Joel Schmacher who took over after Burton the series got the wrong idea thinking that critics meant the series needed to be colorful. ...
  Well anyway Burton's versions were moody and violent but...I liked the series a hell of a lot more that way. People complained that the Penguin shouldn't have really been a half penguin half man and that Cat women shouldn't have actually had 9 lives. Well that's silly I agree but a lot more clever than anything Joel brought to the series. Riddler and Two Face were like the villains of the old 60's Batman tv show, they just laugh non-stop with a bunch of dumb lines. Scary enough Batman & Robin was even more like the 60's tv show. George Clooney might have been a good Batman if he was working with Tim Burton and not a silly script full of terrible on-liners. Uma Thurman makes a good Poison Ivy but she has nothing but bad lines to say as well. No ones lines are as bad as Arnold's though as Mr. Freeze. Instead of  being called Mr. Freeze his name should have been Nursery Rhyme Man. He was a really bad choice as well for the part. I also though Christopher Lloyd should have played Mr. Freeze. Also if Robin being around wasn't bad enough Alicia Silverstone arrives as Barbara Alfred's grandaughter  or something dumb like that. Funny I  thought she was related Commisioner Gordon in the comics ?
  Anyway the first one is the best. Some people say it should have been called the Joker since he has more screen time than Batman. I think that's silly as Batman still gets to shine and still has a lot of cool scenes. It's Batman Returns which the villain the Penguin has a lot more to do than Batman himself. Even if the villains have too much screen time in Burton's versions at least he took them seriously. I would have loved to see the series continued with him helming them. I still wonder how cool he could have made a character like the Scare Crow. Burton also had the right idea having Batman alone. Most Batman fans like myself don't even like Robin lol.
  I'd rate the first Batman ****. It's a dark but highly entertaining. Michael Keaton may have been too short for the part but still managed to give us the best Batman of all of them. Plus was easier to take him seriously without  a whole bunch of corny lines. Jack Nicholson is awesome as the Joker, he has a lot of one liners but wow what do know they worked. He was a bit over the top but he was scary as well as being actually  funny as well. I'd give Batman Returns *** for the performances and the direction. I'd give Batman Forever *** for the cast and how it is sorta fun even if it is nothing compard to the first 2. I'd give Batman & Robin * 1/2. George Clooney makes a good Bruce Wayne but as Batman he didn't get much of a chance to prove himself. With better material maybe he could have worked as Batman. Uma Thurman like I said is good as well. Everything else...is just bad. The set design for Gotham City like in Batman Forever is way too colorful. Joel Schmacher shows more with this one than with Forever why he shouldn't have replaced Burton. Anyway only the first 2 are actually worth owning. Only wish they'd release better dvds for them.",1056931200,,3568,4.371601208459214
919919,4,6304613113,"BATMAN: I didn't see this movie till the summer of 2002 and considering it came out in 1989, it still holds up today on all levels. The acting deserves a 10/10. Michael Keaton was a good choice for Bruce Wayne and performs better as Batman. Jack Nicholsen IS THE JOKER. I wish I knew his name, but the dude who plays Alfred the butler absolutely kills in his roll (he would stay for the rest of the series). Bruce's love interest played by Kim Basinger is good. The visual effects are very good for 1989 and in some ways improves on digital effects-9.9/10. The plot is basically this: Batman goes on his first major mission against mob man Jack Napier and his fellow mobsters. Napier tries to pull a heist on the Axis Chemicals factory and ends up thwarted by the bat. This all results in Jack falling in a pit of chemicals. The experience bleaches his skin white and drives him to insanity. He develops a plan to unleash the chemicals that Joker succumbed to on Gotham City, causing people to literally, laugh themselves to death. Will Batman save Gotham?
The plot gets a solid 9.8/10. As for music, it gets a perfect 10/10 and the movie would not be as powerful without it. Danny Elfman delivers his best score ever PERIOD. Batmans theme is very catchy but dark and edgy at the same time. In fact, I'm humming it right now. Buy the soundtrack AND the movie. The movie as a whole, gets an tight 9.9/10.
BATMAN RETURNS: Tim Burton returns to the helm of the Batman series and churns out one of the best of the sequels. The acting is better than the first. Keaton as Batman again is great. Danny Devito as the haunting Penguin is the third best villain in the quadrilogy (all 4 movies, which should have just been this and its prequel) and turns a very evil character into someone you feel somewhat sorry for. He had a bad life and so he became a bad guy. Michele Pheiffer is the second best villain in the series as Catwoman (Joker is first best). There is great chemistry between Keaton and Pheiffer as they struggle with their love/hate relationship. And Christopher Walken is the smaller villain, Max Shreck, and does well. Acting is 10/10. The plot is something like this: Oswald Cobblepot (alias Penguin) is trying to run for mayor of Gotham City so he can destroy it. Why? Because the city has no place in its heart for deformities as this poor guy, and you really fell sorry for him. Then Catwoman enters, trying to establish a relationship with Batman, and teams up with the Penguin. Batman gets framed for murder, and the whole of Gotham turns against him. And several other plot points exist that I won't put because they would spoil your enjoyment of the movie. Plot is 9.9/10. The visual effects are awesome, particularly the swarms of bats that appear at times and the effects from this 1992 movie stand up well today. 10/10. Music is done by Danny Elfman, and is good, but not as good as the first one. Music is 9.5/10. The movie is good for Christmas viewing, if you have the heart to considering the depressing vision of Gotham during the holidays and the Penguin in particular is depressing with his back story. Great movie. 9.8/10",1055894400,,3148,4.524561403508772
919920,3,6304613113,"Batman **** - a solid comic book adaptation.  Michael Keaton does a great job of establishing personal issues of a man convinced to dress in a bat disguise in order to fight crime.  Jack Nicholson does an uncanny performance as the Joker, you'd think the part was made for him.  The best in the series.
Batman Returns *** - a more personal adaptation.  It's obvious here that due to the success of the first film, the producers gave Dir. Burton more freedom to tell the story.  Not a great idea, movies like this need a better balance between producer/director.  Burton purists may hate that comment.  Still good, but recommend Edward Scissorhands for the director's personal vision.  It's basically the same story.  Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding, Danny DeVito is good and Christopher Walken is well, Chrisotpher Walken in top form with maybe the funniest line in any Batman film, ""Bruce Wayne, why are you dressed up like Batman?""
Batman Forever ** - the beginning of the end.  Dir. Schumacher brings an action packed script to life with a drastically different style from the Burton era.  This shouldn't even really be viewed with the first two.  The performances are good enough, I like Val Kilmer's version of Batman, but not as much as Keaton's.  Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones and Nicole Kidman are all good and end up saving the movie.
Batman & Robin * - the end.  Some hate Clooney's performance as the Batman, but Clooney is more the ideal Bruce Wayne in the comic books (pre-Burton comics that is).  If only Clooney had shook is ER head bobbing problem, he might have given a better performance, but as it stands: not as good as Keaton, better than Kilmer.  Schwarzenegger and Thurman are over stylized villians and strangely out of place due to Schumacher's second failed attempt.  Avoid this film unless a big fan of any of the artists' work.
Final Note - Avoid the legacy and just buy the first two, they're more of a legacy than with the addition of the second two and make a great double feature.  Enjoy.",1054857600,,2019,4.703703703703703
919921,5,6304613113,"This movie series starting in 1989 and ending in 1997 is a truly awesome set consisting of three great Batman movies and one dud of a movie. The first three movies are absolutely amazing and powerful and are as good today as they were back during the years when they were released. This set overall is just a great marathon of tons of action and eye-candy and if you like all four of them (I only liked the first three), then pick this set up.
Here's my review for each of the individual movies:
BATMAN (1989): This first entry in the series was a defining moment in my childhood as a young kid. No I wasn't watching teletubbies or that kind of muck. No! I was watching this amazing and riveting movie entitled ""Batman"" and this was what turned me onto the entire comic book franchise for many years after this movie. Starring Jack Nicholson as the maniacal criminal The Joker, Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Kim Basinger as his romantic interest Vicki Vale, this movie is absolutely a dark, foreboding and totally engaging masterpiece and a true work of art, thanks in part to the dark genius that is Tim Burton. The story is of a criminal mastermind who was badly maimed after an accident at a chemical plant and driven mad into insanity and becoming the homicidal maniac The Joker and Batman goes on his first major crime-fighting mission to stop him and his menacing crime sprees. The scenery in this movie and the dark and highly foreboding atmosphere make this movie absolutely a masterpiece. The entire cast must have had a great time filming this movie. Hats off to Tim Burton for bringing Batman to life. This movie defined a period in my childhood.
BATMAN RETURNS (1992): A wicked and absolutely dark successor to the 1989 original and a classic all on it's own ""Batman Returns"" continues the dark foreboding atmosphere of the first movie but with an even darker and much colder mood. This outing brings the mysterious crimefighter against two major criminals. One is a corrupt industrial CEO named Max Schreck and the other is the main villain Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin. Danny DeVito was absolutely brilliant in his role as Cobblepot/Penguin, showing the extremely twisted and malicious personality of the character. The third villain is somewhat uncertain. That is the sultry Catwoman. Played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Catwoman could as well be the most complex and most perplexing character in the entire Batman movie saga. Is she truly a villainess or a heroine? Perhaps both? Makes you wonder. Anyhow, ""Batman Returns"" is a dynamite and cold classic for the ages and also defined a moment in my life as well just like the first one did. Hats off to Tim Burton for creating another masterpiece. These two movies directed by Burton will be very difficult for some of the more comic humor audience to digest but overall, they are absolutely incredible movies.
BATMAN FOREVER (1995): ""Batman Forever"" while having it's share of flaws, was a highly enjoyable third entry. This movie went in a very different direction with the reigns passed on to director Joel Shumacher and the end result was a less forboding and more colorful addition to the movie trilogy. Actor Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton in the role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and I have to say he did a good job at succeeding Keaton. Richard Grayson aka Robin comes into the picture and is played by Chris O'Donell and joins the superhero business after his parents and brother are killed when the equipment at a circus stunt collapsed after being sabotaged. The two main villains are the homicidal maniac Two Face and the highly eccentric bozo madman Edward Nigma also known as The Riddler. The two villains team up as they use a special hypnotizing invention that Riddler built while a scientist at a laboratory to ensnare the minds of Gotham City and then eventually the world. Batman and his new sidekick Robin team up against them to stop their malicious goal of taking over the world population. While this movie is far less foreboding and brighter in general with a bit more comical humor, the darkness of the first two and the colorfulness of Shumacher's directing perfectly balanced each other out well. Schumacher did a great job with this movie. I wish I could've said the same for the following movie. To me, the series should've stopped right here. This is the last Batman movie from my perspective.
BATMAN & ROBIN (1997): OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN! After the success of three awesome Batman movies, the entire franchise comes to a disheartening end with this abysmal fourth installment in the series. I don't necessarily agree with George Clooney being unworthy of playing Batman nor Arnold Schwardsanegger as Mr. Freeze but the entire plot of the movie was very weak and completely devoid of any signs of development. The two main villains in this movie are Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Unfortunately, great potential for a great follow-up to ""Forever"" was completely wasted on excessive colors and too much MTV style directing, not to mention awful acting by all of the cast except for Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth who was very good actually, and terrible lines and MTV-style sequences. Everyone on the cast looks incredibly uncomfortable and Schumacher completely stunts any possible character development from taking form. This movie is just a sad and tragic ending to a marvelous movie legacy. In fact, it doesn't even deserve to have been categorized with the other three Batman movies. Schumacher and company owe the entire fan base an apology for this mess!!
This set overall, apart from ""Batman & Robin"", is a great purchase if you don't have any of these movies yet. This set isn't perfect because of the disastrous ""Batman & Robin"" and would've been perfect had that 1997 flop been taken out of this set. For the few who like the atrocious final Batman movie in the series, then by all means pick this set up. For the ones who liked the first three, or even just the first two, this set is worth passing by but the first three are worth getting. It's just sad to see a great comic book hero be unraveled down to laughing stock.",1053907200,,6143,4.785310734463277
919922,5,6304613113,"Here we have it, all four Batman films all together in one DVD box set. The series started in 1989 with the original classic Batman. In 1992, the series was continued with the superior Batman Returns. In 1995, Batman's story continued, and Robin was introduced in Batman Forever. The series ended in 1997 with Batman & Robin.  Here I'll review each film, as well as the DVD.
Batman: Here, Batman is played excellently by Michael Keaton.  Batman must save Gotham City from The Joker (Jack Nicholson). Keaton makes a great Batman, and Nicholson is superb as The Joker. Tim Burton brings a dark visual style which I vastly prefer to Joel Schumacher's neon colored versions. Movie: (5/5)
Picture Quality: The picture quality is quite good.  A few specks show up every now and then, but nothing too bad. Black level is dead on with excellent clarity.  (4.5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is excellent. It was great to hear the Batman theme with such clarity and force. A great soundtrack all around. (5/5)  Extras: The extras are some very interesting production notes, which are quite informative.  (3/5)
Batman Returns: The best film in the series. This time, Batman (Keaton) must save Gotham from the evil monster, The Penguin (Danny DeVito), and the slinky, mysterious Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Once again, Keaton makes an excellent Batman. DeVito is also excellent as the montrous Penguin, but it's Pfeiffer who unquestionably steals the show. Easliy the best film in the series. (5/5) Picture: Batman Returns features stunning imagery as well as some dark imagery which the DVD captures beautifully. Black level is dead on. The picture is wonderfully crisp and clear. Great all around. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is also great. Surrounds are used heavily and to great effect. I've never heard this film be so clear and dynamic! (5/5) Extras: Some very interesting production notes. (3/5)
Batman Forever: Here's where the series took a dip. Burton gave up the directoral reigns to Joel Schumacher. This film is still pretty good, though, despite what others think. Batman is played by Val Kilmer who makes a pretty good Batman, but he's no Michael Keaton. This time, Batman must battle Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey). Batman falls in love with Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), and teams up with Robin (Chris O' Donnell). (4.4/5) Picture: The DVD displays stunning image quality. The colors are so vibrant and bold. Black level is dead on. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is incredibly clear and dynamic. Surrounds are put to heavy use. (5/5) Extras: Again, some interesting production notes. (3/5)
Batman & Robin:  Easily the worst of the series.  I still find it somewhat enjoyable for it's pure campiness. Now George Clooney plays Batman. Clooney's okay, but Michael Keaton IS Batman. Batman (Clooney) and Robin (O' Donnell) must save Gotham City from Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and Bane (Jeep Swanson). They're joined by Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). (3.7/5) Picture: The picture quality is pristine, with excellent clarity.  The colors are very vibrant and bold. Black level is also dead on. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is very clear and dynamic. The surrounds are put to constant use. (5/5) Extras: Again, some interesting production notes. (3/5)
Conclusion: The Batman Legacy is worth it if you're a fan of the series, or really like the Batman character. While Batman Forever and more so Batman & Robin are a little less than perfect, the first two films are more than worth it.",1049846400,11,3596,5.040404040404041
919923,4,6304613113,"Normally, I would've rated this with 5 stars, but unfortunately, ""Batman & Robin"", the 4th in the series thus far, was poorly produced. But let's keep this current. As of January 28th, 2003, it was announced that they will, in fact, be making more batman movies. We can only hope that they will be closer to the legend of Bruce Wayne's alter ego as was captured in 1989's Batman, directed by Tim Burton.
  My idea of Gotham city, the world of Batman, is a dark and grizzled one, full of 'goth' architecture, and knarled, twisted, alleys, matching it's brand of psychotic criminals that inhabit Gotham city. My idea of a man capable of performing such a feat of technology, intelligence, strength, martial arts, skill, and detective mastery, not to mention pure vengeful determination as to adequately wear the cowl can be a disturbing one. Taken into account that we are talking about someone purely fictional is often relief, but also a tale of tragedy turned into triumph. I still marvel (snicker) at the special effects accomplished for all 4 movies, no matter how poor the 4th installment was. Regarding the movies themself: Usually the first in the series is the best and would be for this series starter as well. Batman was brilliantly filmed, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker was perfect. Regarding 'Returns', most people don't consider it as good as its predessor. I don't agree. I see 'Returns' as more of an internal movie, more psychological, which I thought was also well done. Another great Batman adventure with a different approach. Batman Forever was also done well, and quite honestly, I thought Val Kilmer made the role of Wayne/Batman more three-dimensional as opposed to the cardboard cutout that unfortunately Michael Keaton provided. The riddler was done flawlessly by Jim Carey and surprisingly, Robin was also introduced as a working character by Chris O'Donnell. However, when 'Batman & Robin' was released it showed the inevitable clunkiness of the franchise due to an overproduced, overcommercialized mess of a movie with a weak plot. It's unfortunate to see the Batman series leave off with such a weak bookend. Hopefully, however, the next installment will be far better than this one. Otherwise, it's a great series of movies.",1043798400,,2255,4.99468085106383
919924,4,6304613113,"I've been a big fan of the Warner Bros. Batman series since I was a little kid, seeing the original in theaters. I felt compelled to buy this box-set because of all of the memories and nostalgia, and the fact that 3 out of the 4 movies are excellent and I wanted to be able to watch them in all of their glory on their best format: DVD. Now, as far as special features go, look elsewhere. Most box-sets usually include a bonus disc with extra stuff on it, but that is not found here. The most you will get for extras on the individual DVD's is production notes and cast & crew bio's. But still, if you are a fan of the movies, you should own this set because all 4 of them look (and sound) absolutely stellar on DVD. It's a nice upgrade from those jurassic era tapes I used to have (I still have the original Batman tape, the one distributed in 1989, Talk about lousy quality!). Each disc comes with both standard and widescreen format, which is a plus. As far as the movies themselves go? Well, we all know what a waste Batman & Robin was. It pretty much killed the series and really, it has no redeeming features, even though it is nice eye candy on DVD. Batman Returns is my personal favorite, it is extremely dark and twisted and all of the actors (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken) are excellent for their roles. The whole story revolves around tragedy. A lot of people don't like this movie because it is too grimy and gritty, and really, it's not for everyone. For me, it just works. Batman Forever was when Tim Burton stepped out of the director's chair and Joel Schumacher (8mm, Bad Company) took his place. I actually like this film. It's a nice combination between Burton's signature darkness and Schumacher's comic-book-like flair and style. Batman is the original, and although it has it's flaws, it still stands as one of the best super-hero movies ever made. Overall, I would have to say I am pleased with this box-set, aside from the throw-away Batman & Robin and the lack of special features, it satisfies.",1037836800,2,2058,4.505347593582887
919925,4,6304613113,"Well, How can I say this.. I remember back in 1989 when I first saw Batman with Micheal Keaton... it was most probably one of the best Superhero movies ever ....
It was followed by another movie which was almost as good known as Batman Returns, with a cast like Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Devito and Micheal Keaton what more could we expect but pure perfection... ..:)
The last two, ...Plain and simple they were like kids stories. Another loss was the fact that Tim Burton did not direct them. His dark loomy presence was not felt and they seem to be geared move towards children... the magic was lost..  Final say I recommend this because of the first 2 movies.",1034640000,,661,4.508333333333334
919926,3,6304613113,"The film version of BATMAN saw director Tim Burton ditch the campy 60s ""KAPOW!"" action and outrageous villians and go much deeper and darker. Michael Keaton IS Batman, evoking the same troubled character from the DC comics, and of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker, a great character played brilliantly. Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully. Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action is well done. The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book-styled-action and dark storytelling.

BATMAN RETURNS is much darker than the first film, yet still satisfying, popcorn-munching fun, with an apt blend of comic book action and trademark Burton weirdness. With Michael Keaton returning as the bat, Danny DeVito as the creepy pengiun and Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy Catwoman, Batman Returns has everything fans could want. The styilised look of Gotham City is fantastic. Danny Elfman's exciting yet creepy score fits perfectly with the film's tone. The only thing slightly amiss is the plot, but that hardly matters when it's Burton at the helm, and a sharp script and some witty one-liners make up for it's flaws.
BATMAN FOREVER has it's flaws, but it's still a solid entry into the franchise. Val Kilmer takes over the role of Bruce Wayne, and while he's not as good as Michael Keaton, he manages to portray the character well. Joining Kilmer is Chris O'Donnell as Robin, and the bad guys; Tommy Lee Jones as the disfigured ""Two Face"" and the suitably manic Jim Carrey as the crazed Riddler.  There are problems; the action takes over most of the time, leaving little in the way of exposition or plot for that matter. And the vertigo-inducing camera angles and frenetic pacing leaves the audience wanting something perhaps a little more grounded.

The first two radiate with powerful storytelling and unerring capacity for mystery and intrigue. Batman Forever changes speed and flips to a comic rendition of Laurel & Hardy while introducing Robin. Some of Tim Burton's handiwork keeps it tolerable. Batman & Robin - well, the only good thing about is Uma Thurman who plays ultra-sexy ""Poison Ivy."" I do toast a cup to Alfred who's remained a reason to see the last two films.

919928,2,6304613113,"One of the greatest tragedies on film is the Batman series; not the story, but the movies themselves. If you must see one, you may be somewhat satasfied by the first. If you see two, you might want to check out Batman Returns. It's okay, but not nearly as good as the first. Batman Forever features Val Kilmer, whom I consider to be THE BEST batman, so you may want to see that film for his performance (be warned though, the film is a STINKER! And, Val Kilmer's performance is hampered by poor dialouge and the cheap Micheal Keaton impersonation that was forced on him). As for Batman and Robin, STAY AWAY FROM IT! ... I find almost all of the villains to be 99.9 % innacurate to their comic book and cartoon show counterparts. And, why the heck do they have to team up the villains, and why in such stupid pairs? The Penguin and Catwoman? Two-Face and the Riddler? MR. FREEZE AND POISON IVY? You get my drift. If you see one, just see the original. It's decent (but there are some odd casting choices, and somewhat shallow story). If you see two, see Batman Returns, however Danny Elfman's score isn't as good, and there are some annoying story decsisions. However, if you want REALLY good batman movies, I suggest the three excellent animated Batman attempts: Mask of the Phantastm, Sub Zero, and Return of the Joker. Each one chronicles a different batman era: When he was a loner, when there was a team, and when he trains the new Batman.
If you're looking for a top notch live action film though, I'm afraid you'll have to wait for Batman: Year One. ...",1026345600,3,1559,4.473684210526316

919998,5,6304613113,"Another fanatastic DVD collection. The first 2 Batman's are truly works of wonders. I thought Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Danny Devito as the Penguin were excellent choices for those particular villians. I wasn't very sure about Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman but she pulled it off quite well. I thought Val Kilmer did a good job in the 3rd film, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were absolutley a riot and the addition of Robin (Chris O'Donnel) was a cool also.
The first clue for me that the 4th film had some problems was that Arnold Schwarzenegger got top billing. Clooney just couldn't pull it off The way Keaton and Kilmer did. But they surrounded him with a super cast that included Alicia Silverstone and Umma Thurman plus Chris O'donnell returning as Robin. When this movie started off with Batman and Robin on ice skates (or batskates, your choice), I thought I was watching the old TV show. I was just waiting for a ""Kapow"" or ""Boom"" to show up on the screen. Still, for the most part it was entertaining to watch and not a bad movie, just had alot to live up to.
The most amazing thing was probably the fact they always had great casting and every actor/acctress they chose to play the villain was right on the money.
This DVD collection is definitley worth the money, especially those who are Batman fans.",1003708800,,1323,4.563025210084033
919999,4,6304613113,"BATMAN.......this movie was a classic, the original Batman, we've got Michael Keaton as the alleged Masked hero, and outstanding performance by Jack Nicholson playing the one and only Joker, of corse we've got outstanding makers of this film, Tim Burton's first time directing which was extrordinary, he really put the right image of the Dark comic book version of Batman in Gotham City, and let us not forget the beautifle masterpiece of Batman's theme and the score by Danny Elfman in which he won an oscar for. Batman Returns,a very most darker tone, the same people,includinge new stars; Michelle Pheiffer and Danny Devito as the sick and twisted Penguin, this movie had some insite with its story of Batman, Catwoman and, Penguin. Batman Forever.......this movie was a completly different point of view of the Dark Batman Knight, with Zanny Jim Carrey as the Insane Riddler [aside from the possible oneliners to be said, it was a great role] and of corse the great Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, but this wasn't Batman, Keatonless, Burtonless, Elfmanless, the greats that made the first 2 landmarks, yet the director did capture the cartoonish Batman comic style introducing Robin. As for Batman & Robin, whew! nice cast and all but, these guys are flying through the air,swinging from strings, Mr. Freeze is frozen not Mr.super human strength, Poisun Ivy.....just think Uma Thurman, it was a nice role, too many pointless oneliners, interfacing with God only to put a dramatic realization to the un real, un dark, un batman story and not only that they dragged it on for 2 hours or so, the only thing worth the price of admission is the cast and the ""action"". Aside from the 4th, the first 2 are absolutly incredible movies the 3rd is entertaining and watchable and.......worth the price.",999475200,3,1792,4.937086092715232
920000,3,6304613113,"How can one judge a set like this .  First there is Tim burtons masterpiece Batman.  A movie that word can not do justice to.  It is every bit effective today as when released in 1989 (can it be that long ago?).  His follow-up Batman Return though different is a much under appreciated masterpiece. DeVito and Walken had real chemistry and seemed to have a great time.  Keaton again pulled off the ultimate Batman performance.  All in all a great follow up.  I give both Batman and Batman Returns 5 stars each.  Unfortuneately for the next two movies we fall into the Joel Schumacher years.  Apparently determine to bring Batman back into the the 1960's camp mold, we see the change coming in Batman Forever, but a good performce by O'Donnell as Robin and Jim Carey's stint as Riddler saved that movie.  Forget Kilmer as Batman, he just did not have it. Things then fell apart with Batman and Robin.  Despite a decent show by Arnold this movie was a mess and never gave Clooney a chance to see what he could do in the role.  Batman was a joke again and this movie was an insult and disaster to all Batman fans.  Batman Forever gets 3 stars while Batman and Robin barely scrapes 1 star.  My advice, skip this set and simply buy the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton.",997401600,11,1269,4.413793103448276
920001,3,6304613113,"I won't mince words.  Batman a.k.a. the Caped Crusader, Dark Knight, etc. is the greatest superhero ever fathomed up.  I, being a huge Batman fan, was extremely satisfied by the first two Batman movies for the following reasons: Michael Keaton was an excellent choice for Batman, the villains Joker and Penguin were well casted and acted well, the movies were action packed and were exciting to watch, and they were well written.  However, Batman Forever was not half as good as the first two because they made Batman too flashy, and the villians were not scary or feared in the least. Riddler is such a great villain, and they screwed him up by casting Jim Carrey.  Now don't get me wrong, Jim Carrey is really funny, but he couldn't pull of the slick, smooth roll of Riddler.  And let's not forget Two-Face, who acted like a moron throughout the movie.  Still, Val Kilmer did a good job as Batman.  But I would have to say that Batman and Robin was the dumbest movie ever made by Hollywood.  George Clooney, being as cool as he is, was a terrible choice for Batman.  The villains, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, were ridiculous.  That movie was terrible....that's the bottom line.  So the people who are considering to buy this Batman pack, do yourself a favor and just buy the first two on DVD.  You will be very satisfied and will save money.",994636800,,1342,4.569037656903766
920002,5,6304613113,"I saw the first of the BATMAN Movie series back in '89 and it was awesome! I've never watched a movie before made in such manner as Batman at that time, the fx were great, it set the tone for all the Batman Movies. The storylines were simple but really great, the dark settings was perfect for the caped crusader. Batman series is superbly batter than the Superman Movie series (my apology to supey's fan).And the Actors who played Batman's foes were all very,very brilliant most especially J.Nicholson (astonishing) on the JOKER and J.Carrey(oh man he's really,really great for the role) on The Riddler. Tim Burton & Joel Shumacher really did a good job in reliving the Comic Book Hero into the Big Screen...and oh ofcourse M.Keaton,V.Kilmer & G.Clooney they did a credible acting on Bruce/Batman...although if I may suggest make Batman a little bit human in the next outing because he's too solidly cool during his fights with the villains & during precarious moments which is the reason I'm looking forward to seing the next Batman,oh by the way maybe we could see Kurt Russel or Mel Gibson or even Pierce Brosnan in Batman's tight! I'm sure they'll all be great & lastly may we request James Caneroon or Bryan Singer to come on board, this will be interesting!!!And my verdict...you must be a fool if you'll not gonna pick-upthe BATMAN Legaycy..that is if you're a fan of the Darknight Detective!!!!...",992131200,,1406,4.81404958677686
920003,1,6304613113,"One of the main reasons to buy a boxset is for the extra features that may not be available if you were to purchase a dvd seperately. I don't see any listed here. Where is the running commentary,an making of featurette,behind the scenes,storyboards,theatrical trailers?This is dvd,there is plenty of storage space for all of that. Come on Warner Bros.,get a move on. You expect me to buy a boxset after i already purchased the first 3 seperately,but you're not willing to add extras?I'm a huge Batman fan of the first three. Keaton played the Dark Knight with a certain mystery and underlying pathos,Kilmer played him as a man who is confused when it comes to women,and someone who begins to question his priorities. Was fighting crime an selfish endeavor,or an selflless responsibility. All of them look and sound great,but the 4th was a total misfire,and not just because Clooney,among others,was miscast. I said it before about Jurassic Park,give me an boxset version with DTS audio,loaded with extra features,and for me this would be another definite purchase.",988761600,3,1064,5.051136363636363
920004,3,6304613113,"Batman and Batman Returns are incredible.  Batman sets the perfect environment for the comic book to come to life.  Batman Returns is pure eye candy with it's increidlbe visuals.  The snow is a great contrast that expands on the look and feel of the original in a way that I would have though impossible.  Tim Burton is one of the best directors ever.  He makes every film his own and always adds something that lasts forever in your mind.
Joel Schumaker is horrible!  It should be illegal for him to get behind any camera, even one of those cheap disposable Kodak ones.  He does to these films what airlines do to food!  What was he thinking?  I can understand him wanting to add to these films and make them more his own, but why just make them stupid and silly?  Now I also think people blame the wrong person for the last film.  I happen to think George Clooney was a good Batman. I think he does a better job being Bruce Wayne than Batman, but still pretty good.  No one will match the comic wit and likability of Keaton, but Cloney was ten times better than Kilmer.  Kilmer made it unbearable to watch.  The villians are great in the first two, but they lose something in the last two, I think it's called direction.  What a waste of Thurman's and Carrey's talent!  Under Burton they would have been incredible.
I would like to wrap this up with a plea to both Burton and Schumaker.  Mr. Burton, make one more of these and fix this mess.  Kill Batman off in the end if you like, just do us all a favor and talk to Keaton and Pfifer and make at least one more.  Mr. Schumaker, please retire.  Do not touch any more superhero movies and try to leave good stars alone.  I mean what you did to Cage and Phoenix in 35mm is horrible.  Why the red light district in LA?  LA is a red light district, you idiot!  Your talent has always been over rated and now you just make people not like you.  Please stop!",982368000,8,1905,4.26890756302521

Personally, I think it would still have to be Batman the frist movie with Michael Keaton as the best damn Batman there ever was. I loved Jack Nicholson as the Joker which was very good in the roll of Batman. Batman Returns ain't too bad cause Batman was still Keaton but then he comes Batman Forever which is yet another of my favorites but this time Michael Keaton wasn't playing Batman anymore. Though the movie did contain one of my favorite villians in Two-Face but the movie was to goofy and made Batman not as serious as he was back in the first two movies. Batman & Robin the movie was the hell dropper of wrost Batman movie yet. I hated the fourth Batman movie.

Batman 1989 is really good which stars Jack Nicholson Micheal Keation and Kim Basinger
This movie is funny full of action pack and its really close to the classic Batman
Batman Returns: The last Batman movie to star Micheal Keation as Batman the movie  also stars Danny Devito and Michelle Preiffer
This Batman movie is my favorite as well and it is just as good as the first one, however It is a little darker and Gothic  then the first Batman movie and its is a little sad  romance for Batman and Catwoman You can really tell its a Tim Burtion movie then the first due to the Gothic elements of the movie it is just as good as the first one.
Batman Forever  stars Val Kilmer Tommy Lee Jones Jim Carey Nicole Kidman and Chris O Donnell
This Batman I did enjoy, but its not my favorite it is not as good as the first two but it is better then Batman and Robin
Batman and Robin Stars Arnold  Schwarzenegger George Clooney Chris O Donnell Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone
this Is the only Batman I don't care about in the collection Worst Batman ever made the only reason why people would have it is because it is part of the collection but 3 out of one batman to like is that bad for the set so its still worth it",1520640000,,1507,4.1194539249146755
