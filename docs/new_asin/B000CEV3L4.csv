2463477,4,B000CEV3L4,"I really, really hate to write a negative review...especially when I want the studios to keep mining their vaults for DVD releases of classic films.  So many have yet to be released...but the profit margins are slimmer than the money to be made on the latest action flicks.

But why in the world would they not release Holiday as a single disc?  I own three of the other four DVDs...and I'm sure I'm not alone.  Is it an oversight?  Or greed?

One thing I do know...writing or emailing the studios can make a difference.  Signature campaigns by movie fans got several of the recent '40s and '50s DVD releases to happen.  So go to the studio homepages and let 'em know what you think.

And good for them for releasing these movies...I can vouch for the high quality of the transfers of three of them.  But release Holiday by itself...please?",1138924800,17,840,4.54

WowI'm so happy that I did. The films are preented in great shape and the packaging was very atrractive. Cary Grant Grant is always a delight and when opposite Rosalind Russell, Jean Arthur or Katherine Hepburn who can go wrong.

Many others who have purchased this thought it was unfair that the film Holiday with Katherine Hepburn was not available alone, but only as part of this box set.

At that I am able to appreciate the quality of the actors (in this case Cary Grant) and the movie's productions. The talent is obvious and his ability to bring an earthy happiness to the screen is a plus. I like to think of myself in the situations the writers have established and Mr. Grant's portrayal is very amusing.

All of the movies in this set are B&W but this doesn't detract from the performances by Cary Grant and the slew of leading ladies, Rosalind Russell, Irene Dunne, Katherine Hepburn, Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth. It is great value for money and even though I already had His Girl Friday I was happy to buy another copy because of all the other great movies that came with it. This set also includes post cards and photos of the stars which was a pleasant surprise bonus. The Talk of the Town with Jean Arthur and Ronald Coleman alongside Cary Grant is a real treat.

My husbabd watched every one of these movies as he's retired and admires Cary Grant's presence on the screen as well as his brilliance in delivering the characters he plays in this collection.

2463511,5,B000CEV3L4,"I've reviewed the films in this collection individually, so I wanted to comment on this actual collection called THE CARY GRANT BOX SET. Here are 5 of Grants' early films and a few are among his best. This set is a nice start for anyone wanting to get to know the very talented Cary Grant. He had a look and style that will never be duplicated. He excelled at romantic comedies but could also show a serious side. He never got the awards and acclaim he deserved but he left us a fine legacy of film.

We have Grant in his glorious youth. Vibrant and energetic, he seems to enjoy acting and working with his costars and directors. The films in this box set appear to have been remastered and the black and white films are crisp, clean and clear. Although each film does have extra features, it is a disappointment that they are so minimal. They usually have the film trailer and an advertisement for the Frank Capa or another film series. It's the Featurettes that are worth the time. They may be short but are packed with insight into Cary Grant and his style of acting along with information on the films' directors and costars. Director George Stevens son shared some experiences on one featurette. Film historians and director Peter Bogdanovich shared insight. The featurettes are worth the time but it's a disappointment they are so short.

This is a fine collection for a Cary Grant fan and a good beginning set for people who are unfamiliar with this wonderful actor.",1334102400,,1473,4.596958174904943
2463512,5,B000CEV3L4,"I won't cover what the other reviews have said.  I only came to say, what a great job was done on transferring these old movies to DVD.  I was a little uneasy buying this set because I have an earlier release of ""His Girl Friday"" on DVD that was badly done.  All of these movies are worth having in any Cary Grant DVD collection.  The extra's are very nice, including the postcards of vintage photo's and movie posters (10 in all).  This set is well worth the price.",1290211200,3,466,4.25
2463513,5,B000CEV3L4,"This is the pick of the box sets of Cary Grant's films except if you are crazy about Alfred Hitchcock. All the films were made at Columbia between 1938 and 1942. Harry Cohn ran that studio with an iron fist but as one historian notes in one of the featurettes, he allowed directors to have control and here we have 4 of the best - Howard Hawks x2, Leo McCarey, George Stevens and George Cukor.

Not only is Grant superb in every film, but he is paired with 4 peerless leading ladies - Irene Dunne, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur x2 and Rosalind Russell. Three of the scripts are based on plays - ""Holiday"", ""His Girl Friday"" and ""The Awful Truth"". ""Holiday"" is a freewheeling comedy with a message. ""Friday"" is the brilliant reworking of ""The Front Page"" with a gender change and ""Truth"" one of the peaks of the screwball genre. ""Only Angels have Wings"" is a ripping adventure and ""The Talk of the Town"" is a moody misfire combining comedy, romance and a message in the vein of Frank Capra.

All of the prints are good, the weakest being ""Holiday"". Each film has a featurette, most of which tell more about Grant and the directors than the films themselves. I think they would have been improved if combined into one documentary. ""His Girl Friday"" contains a worthwhile commentary notable for its succint delivery, in contrast to the often verbose dissertations on most DVDs. You can actually watch the film AND listen to the commentary for once. Theatrical trailers are included and there is selected marketing material, notably for a Frank Capra DVD collection of Columbia films.

These are films which still stand up today - mostly good stories, great casts and excellent production values. This is Hollywood at its most entertaining and accomplished.",1287964800,2,1754,4.7631578947368425
2463514,5,B000CEV3L4,"Count me a lifelong fan of Cary Grant.  I have have always enjoyed his work be it in the screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's or his impressive dramatic roles in films like the Hitchcock classic ""North By Northwest"".  A while back I happened upon ""The Cary Grant Box Set"". The price was right so without giving it a second thought I snapped it right up.  Believe me I have not been disappointed. What impressed me most about this collection is the disparate roles Grant plays in these films. It has always amazed me how Grant is able to switch gears with such ease. Here is a brief synopsis of each film:

""Only Angels Have Wings""  For me this was perhaps the most surprising film of the bunch.  In this 1939 movie directed by Howard Hawks our hero plays the role of Geoff Carter, a pilot and the owner of a struggling air transport company in Columbia. He is not a very likable person. Carter's airline is vying for a lucrative contract to transport mail over the Andes mountains.  This is exceptionally dangerous work and Carter must make tough and unpopular decisions.  Planes crash and pilots die but this is simply a cost of doing business in such a remote and mountainous region.  Somebody has to do it and Geoff Carter is bound and determined it is going to be his airline.  A very different role for Grant I thought. Also starring Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth.

""The Talk of The Town""  In this film, Grant plays Leopold Dilg, a mill worker and political activist.  When the mill burns down and a man is killed Dilg is accused by the owner of setting the fire.  The fix is in and Dilg is all but certain to be convicted of arson and murder and will no doubt be executed.  But Dilg escapes from custody and injures his leg in the process.  He turns up at a house owned by an old flame Miss Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur).  At first she is frightened by the encounter but Miss Shelley quickly becomes sympathetic to his plight and scrambles to help him in any way she can.  Matters are greatly complicated because Miss Shelley has rented this house to a law professor named Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman). When Lightcap shows up all hell breaks loose and the results are positively hilarious.  One thing leads to another and Miss Shelley introduces Dilg to the professor as the gardener.  The two become quite friendly and engage in deep philosophical discussions.  Directed by George Stevens this is a film that will capture your attention at the outset and hold it until the final scene.  Outstanding!

""Holiday""  I had never heard of this 1938 film but I must tell you that this one is an absolute delight.  Grant plays the role of Johnny Case who has fallen in love with Julia Seton (Doris Nolan).  Now Johnny is a self-made man and Julia is the daughter of a wealthy industrialist.  Julia and her dad have big plans for Johnny but Johnny is not buying.  He meets Julia's sister Linda (Katherine Hepburn) who is sort of the ""black sheep"" of the family and does not share the rest of her family's desire for wealth and power.  And as you have probably guessed by now Johnny evnetually falls for Linda. Directed by George Kukor I thought that this was a five star film all the way.

""The Awful Truth""  Both Jerry Warriner (Grant) and his wife Lucy (Irene Dunn) are convinced that their spouse is cheating on them.  And with very  good reason.  Looks like their marriage is on the rocks and the couple files for divorce.  The decree will become official in 90 short days.  In the meantime both get engaged to other people.  But something is gnawing at both Jerry and Lucy.  Seems that the prospect of a divorce has made each of them realize that they just can't live without the other after all. But neither will come out and admit it. Instead they go about trying to sabotage each others relationship with hilarious results. For me the highlight of this film is when Lucy crashes a party at the home of Jerry's new fiancee.  The interaction between Grant and Dunne in this scene is positively priceless.  Many consider ""The Awful Truth"" to be the best of the so-called ""screwball"" comedies that Grant appeared in. Personally, I prefer both ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""My Favorite Wife"" to this one but this is a terrific flick as well.

""His Girl Friday""  I became an instant fan of this film the first time I saw it decades ago on television. I always loved movies about the newspaper racket and this one is among the best of the bunch. Grant is the conniving newspaper Walter Burns who is is dealing with the imminent loss of his star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) who just also happens to be his ex-wife.  Hildy has one foot out the door when a major story breaks. Poor Hildy can't resist covering just one more big story and leaves her fiancee high and dry while she chases down every lead she can find. And of course Walter is pulling out all the stops to make sure that Hildy forgets all about ""what's his name"" and gets the story. The interplay between Grant and Russell is hilarious with the two trading barbs at a sometimes breath-taking pace. Grant and Russell succeed in turning what might otherwise have been a rather ordinary film into something quite special.

As you might expect with such a collection ""The Cary Grant Box Set"" includes a number of featurettes with each of the five films.  Another nice touch is the inclusion of 10 collectable postcards featuring vintage photos.  This is a collection that is well worth the money.  Very highly recommended!",1282521600,2,5498,4.557594291539246
2463515,5,B000CEV3L4,"This set contains five wonderful, great, All-Time Classics.  There are no turkeys in this set.  His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth are two of the best comedies of remarriage ever made.  Holiday is a wonderful with Kathrine Hepburn.  The Talk of the Town contains many philosophical ideas concerning laws.  Only Angels Have Wings has Grant in an unusual role, but it is a wonderful film.

This set has five of the greatest films and is the best Cary Grant box set out there.

The unfolds to display the five discs and it even contains postcards that contain the posters and screen shots for each film.

Here is my advice: BUY THIS SET.  It could be my favorite box set available.",1262563200,,679,4.545454545454546
2463516,4,B000CEV3L4,"The films of the 30s and 40s with Cary Grant saw a film actor on the rise and his final ascension into superstardom. Some prefer his 50s and onward persona of suave and sophistication. While I liked the on screen Grant of that era too it is this time period I believe that shows Grant at his best. Here was an actor with great energy,charm,charisma and an understated depth and range in his acting. This collection from Columbia is a great showcase for Grant and a must have for all of his fans.
There are five films included here;Holiday,Only Angels Have Wings,The Talk of the Town,His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth.
All are top notch and delightful films in their own rights and have strong leading ladies for Grant to play with.
Holiday is a film which I have not seen for some 35 years and it was a welcome sight. But as others have noted before me it is not available as a seperate release,and I can see why the film execs have NOT picked it as such;it ranges from good condition to poor. This film has been restored through UCLA using material from their archives,Columbia and The Library of Congress. And when one has to get elements from three seperate sources,the alarm bells go off in my head.
To start with from the opening credits to a good 15 minutes into the film,the picture seems slighly cropped,that is to say, we seem to be looking closer at everything than we should. Heads are precariously close to the top of the frame. Compare this to the other films and you'll see what I mean. Also there is a scene where Hepburn meets Cary's friends. I got the impression the friends got a little too cosy with her a little too quickly than they should have,possibly as a result of some slight footage being left out. When you have to get your build elements from three different sources then the odds are a)neither source has a complete print(or a decent working one) and b)some film may be left out/lost. But this is only my impressions/oppinions.
Most of the other films are generally in very good condition,some a little more grainy than others but good nonetheless. If I was to rate them all from the best to the worst,as far as condition goes,I would put Only Angels Have Wings and The Talk of Town in a two way tie for first,His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth in a two way tie for second and Holiday as a more distant third.
As I mentioned previously Grant's range can not be stated enough. He plays everything from a husband going through a divorce,a jungle pilot,a newspaper editor,a disenchanted husband to be and an innocent criminal on the lamb. All are embued with Grant's ineffable charm and charisma and the humour that plays out in each film is of a quite human and realistic nature. It is the latter that helps draw the viewer into the film and makes them care about the characters much more than they otherwise would. Two of the directors Leo McCary and George Stevens(The Awful Truth and The Talk of the Town respectively)are directly descended from working very closely with Laurel and Hardy. That type of humanistic,realistic,gentle and very funny humour is evident throughout those films especially. And no matter where the plots go,and some get pretty serious at times,they always in the end stay the steady course knowing in the end Grant's character will end on a little higher note than he began.
This set of five DVDS comes in a big slipcase with fold out holders. You will have no complaints as to the discs coming loose. In fact I have to say if anything these discs are a little TOO tight(I thought I'd never say that!).I had a devil of a time trying to get them out.
Each DVD has one or two short featurettes on its' pertinent film but nothing much else worthy of note. There are a nice set of 10 cards included;five lobby repros and five pub pics;very nice.
In conclusion,most of the films have been transferred well with Holiday having the worst number of deficiencies,as noted. But for all you Cary Grant fans and lovers of good films,these are five must haves ready and waiting for you all in one place.",1229817600,,4049,4.540355677154583
2463517,5,B000CEV3L4,"I bought this as a Gold Box special one day.  What a treasure!  The movies contained in this set were some of the greatest Cary Grant movies ever!  They were all made at Columbia in the late 30s and early 1940.  They are all wonderful and have a diverse variety.  Several are plays - Holiday and The Talk of the Town are George Stevens plays and have similar dialogue styles.  Talk of the Town deals with a Supreme Court judge and an escaped accused murder and arsonist who's innocent.  Where is the human side of the law?  Holiday is about a wealthy family trying to find room in their family for a working class Cary Grant as a son-in-law.  Can they manage?  His Girl Friday is one of the greatest screwball comedies.  Better than Bringing Up Baby in my opinion.  The Awful Truth is about a couple who take up divorce as more as a lark than a reality.  The last is Only Angels Have Wings, an exciting, romantic movie that has it all!  Lots of fun with Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth as his former love.  Don't miss that movie!  Sparks fly!

I never saw many of Mr. Grants films when I was growing up, but I do like films from all genres, so I figured I'd give this box set a chance. My parents are up for a visit and since they grew up with these pictures, I thought this would be the time to watch them. I was able to get the perspective of people familiar with them and from people who weren't. I will review each film as I watch them and add the rating to this review and review the films on their individual releases.

2463525,5,B000CEV3L4,"Usually makers of a boxed set of films featuring one artist will put at least one bad or mediocre film in with the rest. This is not the case with this boxed set. All of the films are excellent, and there are featurettes included for all of the movies. Only His Girl Friday gets a commentary track though.

This is the Region 1 debut of Holiday on DVD. It pairs Katherine Hepburn with Cary Grant in a film that is a bit out of step with its time (1938) in that it ponders the wisdom of endlessly pursuing wealth at a time when such thoughts were considered almost un-American. Grant plays a man who becomes engaged to a woman and only later finds out she is the member of a fabulously wealthy family and that he, once a part of the family, will be expected to go to work in the family business and count money for the rest of his life. This is out of step with Grant's character's view on what he wants his future to be, but in step with his fiancee's sister's view of life played by Hepburn.

Only Angels Have Wings (1939) pairs Grant with Jean Arthur. This is a drama/romance with only a few light moments in which Grant plays a pilot and the manager of a small burgeoning South American airline. Arthur is an entertainer who meets Grant and decides he is interesting enough that she wants to know him better so she intentionally misses her boat back to the states. Add in the complication of Grant's old flame (Rita Hayworth) showing up as the wife of a disgraced pilot who is looking for a second chance, and you have the makings of a very good film.

The Talk of the Town (1942) is another chance for Grant to play working class hero opposite Jean Arthur. This time he is a fugitive from justice, falsely accused of torching a factory and causing the death of a factory worker. He decides to hide out in Arthur's home, but the complication is that a famous law professor (Ronald Coleman) has rented the home for the summer and wants nothing but peace and quiet while he writes a book. He winds up with anything but that. This film is a good blend of drama and comedy.

Talking About ""Talk of the Town"" featurette

The Awful Truth (1937) pairs Cary Grant with Irene Dunne in a screwball comedy about a couple that divorces but finds that they really are meant for each other. They spend the whole film sabotaging both their own and each others' romances until they both realize ""the awful truth"". This film allows Cary to be the well-dressed sophistocate who also does some great pieces of physical comedy. The plot also involves the couple's dog, including a bit of detective work involving a tell-tale oversized hat that would make The Thin Man's Asta proud.

The best known film of the bunch is probably ""His Girl Friday"" (1940). This pairs Grant with Rosalind Russell who plays Hildy - Grant's ex-wife and his best reporter. Hildy is leaving the paper and leaving town to become the wife of an Albany insurance agent played by Ralph Bellamy, a man who always plays it safe. Grant's character uses the approaching execution of a man who may be innocent to try and lure Hildy back to the paper and back to him. Poor Ralph Bellamy. This is the second time in this boxed set that he has played a man who obviously doesn't stand a chance against Grant's charms and cunning, the first time being in The Awful Truth.

On Assignment: ""His Girl Friday"" featurette

One of the featurettes mentions that among the stars of the 1930's very few seem to transcend time, and Cary Grant is one of those very few. That's because he didn't really belong to any one era. He was also very fortunate that, after a very few years making some rather mediocre films at Paramount, he was able to negotiate a contract allowing him to work for two studios - RKO and Columbia. These are indeed some of his finest films while at Columbia, and the set is very much worth checking out.",1194825600,29,4079,4.512855209742896
2463526,5,B000CEV3L4,"No actor epitomizes classical Hollywood cinema like the ultra-suave, thoroughly professional Cary Grant, the leading man's leading man. This box set collects Grant's greatest hits of the late '30s-early '40s, right after he jettisoned his stifling Paramount contract to become a free agent for Columbia and RKO. Acting opposite Irene Dunne, Katharine Hepburn, and Rosalind Russell in the set's three uproarious screwball comedies (""Truth"", ""Holiday"", and ""Friday"", respectively), Grant shows off his inimitable flair for witty, machine-gun repartee. Only the riveting ""Angels"" and more cerebral ""Talk"" (opposite the incomparable Jean Arthur) demonstrate why Hitchcock, among others, found the gentleman star such an appealing straight man. If you adore Cary Grant the way I do, this set is a must-have.",1182384000,10,802,5.7478991596638656
2463527,5,B000CEV3L4,"The idea of putting a collection of a screen star's films is always a great idea, but most of the time it doesn't follow through (Exhibit A: The James Stewart Signature Collection. As much as, well, everybody loves Jimmy Stewart, did we really need ""The Cheyenne Social Club""??). That is hardly the case here. Included are essential Cary Grant films, both classic (His Girl Friday), underrated (Only Angels Have Wings) or unreleased (Holiday), his breakthrough role (The Awful Truth), and a charming social comedy (The Talk of the Town).

*THE AWFUL TRUTH: Jerry (Grant) and Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne) both think that they have caught each other in infidelity (He returns home from a ""business trip"" from Florida with oranges from California, She comes back arm in arm with her French voice teacher), so they divorce each other, with 90 days until the thing becomes final. In those 90 days, she dates a sweet, bumbling oil man from Texas (Ralph Bellamy, who made a career out of playing the guy who loses the girl to Cary Grant, see HIS GIRL FRIDAY), and he romances an heiress. As their divorce's final date gets closer and closer, they realize that they're not ready to let each other go...leading to screwball results. This is the film that established Cary as a genuine star, a romantic leading man. His rapport with Irene Dunne is magical, and she's hysterical, especially towards the end when she tries to embarrass his stuffy fiancee's family by pretending to be his boozy sister ""Lola Warriner."" But beneath the laughs lie a deep understanding of marriage and the melancholy of love, leading to one of the cleverest ending shots in history.

*HIS GIRL FRIDAY: Undoubtably the funniest, fastest film ever made. Ace reporter Hildy Johnson (the brilliant Rosalind Russell) just wants to quit the newspaper business and settle down with a safe (re: dull) fiance Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany. But her ex-husband/boss/editor Walter Burns (Grant) won't let her go that easily. Russell is probably the only woman who could go shoulder-to-shoulder with Cary Grant, in a way that even Katharine Hepburn and Irene Dunne couldn't have topped. She delivers each of her lines with precise timing, and proves that, like all great Hawksian women, she is ""just one of the guys."" This was the third collaboration between Grant and Howard Hawks, the versatile director of ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""Scarface"", ""Only Angels Have Wings"" and ""The Big Sleep."" They made 5 films together, 4 screwball comedies and one action-adventure/drama (ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS). This is the best of their screwball comedies, and Cary Grant's on-screen persona as a lovable rogue who gets the girl by being the crueller of the two and always indirectly asking her to stay, is at his best here. This film is a must-have for any film buff.

*THE TALK OF THE TOWN: Although this is the least flashy of the set, it's a nicely made comedy of social manners directed by George Stevens. Leopold Dilg (Grant) is a political activist who is framed for arson and murder. He hides out in the summer house of Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur), a teacher as well as Leopold's childhood sweetheart. But Nora has rented out the house to a stuffy candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court, Professor Lightcap (Ronald Coleman). After Leopold has introduced himself to the professor as Joseph the Gardener, Nora and Leopold must convince the professor to help Leopold out. The dialogue about social conflict hasn't aged very much and translates well today. Though the love triangle is a little bit stale and the film is about 20 minutes too long, all three actors make their roles lively and believable. Jean Arthur particularly has nice chemistry with Grant.

*HOLIDAY: Johnny Case (Grant), a fun-loving man with a joie de vivre, thinks he has met the love of his life in Julia Seton (Doris Nolan), a woman he knows little about other than that he loves her. When he goes to meet her family, he realizes that she belongs to a very rich family of bankers, whose patriarch is particularly stuffy and wants his daughter to marry into another rich family. Johnny also meets Julia's siblings, the alcoholic Ned and independent-thinking Linda (Katharine Hepburn). As the film continues, Johnny and the audience find out just how much Julia is like her father, someone who only cares about money, and we see that Johnny is really a much better match for Linda. But will he follow his brain or his heart? (Little hint: if you actually think that Cary Grant will ride off into the sunset with someone named Doris Nolan, you've never seen a movie.) Slight predictability aside, this is a sparkling gem. Johnny doesn't want to work all his life; his plan is to save up enough money to spend his days in relaxation and on holiday, then go back to work when he's figured out what he's working for. This type of thinking would become a hit in the 60s, so it's incredibly surprising to see it shown in a movie from 1938. Katharine Hepburn is wonderful in her signature role, an independent woman with a heart full of love underneath it all. I liked how even though you know that Cary and Katharine will end up together, you see genuine chemistry, especially in their body language, between Cary and Doris Nolan. Her flaw isn't initially obvious, unlike how you see a mile ahead that Meg Ryan and Bill Paxton aren't a match in SLEEPLESS IN SEATLE. This film was ahead of its time in so many ways, and if not for the lack of sex, violence and today's modern stars, I'd confuse it for a romantic comedy made from today.

*ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS: Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur again) is on her way back to New York, just passing through a small Columbian town Barranca, home to a group of tough-shelled pilots who fly mail to hard-to-reach places. The leader of these pilots is Geoff Carter (Grant), who has the toughest shell to crack. He never has attachments to anybody, probably due to the frequent deaths of friends. This is shown in the first twenty mintues of the film, when the death of a pilot devestates Bonnie but the gang acts as though nothing has happened. It doesn't take her long to become just ""one of the guys"", and she decides to stay. Another unexpected visitor comes in the form of Bat Kilgallen--MacPherson, a pilot shunned for previously jumping out of a crashing plane, leaving his engineer to die...the man he left to die was the brother to Kid Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), Geoff's best friend. Also along for the ride is Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth in a breakthrough role), Geoff's ex-love. As tensions both personal and sexual start to rise, we are entertained by a nifty script with numerous memorable quotes, excellent performances and some spectacular flying scenes which aren't cutting-edge by today's standards but nonetheless thrilling. This is a great role for Grant, as a stoic man who gradually unravels the veil to reveal a sad and broken man, something he would do 7 years later in NOTORIOUS. Jean Arthur makes another great Hawksian woman, probably the most vulnerable of them all. Her chemistry with Grant is sweet (just look at the scene where he scoops her up in his arms, thinking her leg is hurt) and natural. An underrated film for both Grant and Hawks, this was a big hit in 1939, considered the golden age of cinema. This film is usually passed over for films like GONE WITH THE WIND and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON among others, but this melodrama comes off as a standard action film and ends up becoming a revealing character study. If only Michael Bay could take notes from this film.

You won't find a better collection of Cary Grant films in a better boxed set. Included are 10 postcards from his films (Represented for each is film is one picture of him and his leading lady, the other is a copy of the original poster), plus the box package has some swank photos of Cary and some of his greatest quotes (""Everybody wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant.""). Don't we all, Cary. Don't we all...",1176595200,52,7988,4.743165467625899

For fun, see if you can do better--at worst you'll spend $18 for ""Holiday"" and once you have it in the player you won't find yourself complaining much.

This is a wonderful collection and for anyone who enjoys screwball comedy (and close approximations) of the 30's and 40's it's a must have. As the years pass it's getting more and more obvious that Cary Grant occupied a unique leading man/comic-great position that no one will ever top. His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth alone are two of the best in this genre (and the others ain't bad either).",1152921600,9,954,4.329608938547486

Can you honestly tell me these types of films were actually relevant enough to put out on DVD?  Hackney plots that go no where with tons of nonsense dialogue as filler.  Stupid, irrelevant, and just plain awful.  Who the hell could like such things?  Yes I was brought up on the Star Wars generation but I can appreciate good acting.

Why else would they release a box set where 4 of the 5 titles were previous available?  Also, see the new Mel Brooks box set.  You will have to buy that just to get titles such as ""High Anxiety"" and ""Silent Movie"".  How about the deluxe Scarface edition from a few years ago, that was the only way to get the original Scarface (1932) on DVD.  There are many more examples. Don't get me started on the habit or releasing special editions only months after the first edition came out.  Enough is enough!
I don't agree that we have to rate the movies (of course they are 5 star films), I can go to Maltin, or elsewhere, for reviews. What's nice about this forum is we can get peer assessments of DVD content, extra features, transfer quality, audio quality, etc.  That's useful.

that is NOT a review of this item..but a complaint about not having something else...

these are basically CLASSIC Cary Grant films...and for the most part presented with from good to VERY GOOD quality of transfers and  with some very nice bonus features...all for less than $10 each!! and cased in a quality package/presentation.

My only reservation is that there is an odd ""redoubling"" of images at some scene transitions - Grant or another character walks through a door, and with the next scene we see something like a ""false start"" as the figure starts through and then ""repeats"" a second time.

Corporate greed is behind (1)releasing multiple editions of the same disc, (2)shady box set deals, (3)rushed editions of movies using bad prints and poor transfers (anybody remember the Bergman box set fiasco, or the appalling prints used for Ray's Apu trilogy?).

2463550,4,B000CEV3L4,"I do agree with all of the Holiday issues-it should be released on a separate disc, and that is why this set is not rated 5 stars. However, the movies in the set are all GREAT. They are some of the best of Cary Grant and all of the other reviewers seem to completely ignore that. If you don't have two or three of the movies aside from Holiday, I would highly suggest this set-it is most certainly worth it. For those who already own three of the four previously released, I would think about how much I really loved Holiday before buying this.

A quick rundown of the movies in this set (for those who do not already know about them.):

His Girl Friday (1940)-a hilarious comedy, one of Cary Grant's best, is an update of The Front Page with Rosalind Russell as reporter Hildy who is attempting to leave Grant's newspaper to get married. Great comedic timing and perfomances turn this into an instant classic-and one of AFI's top 20 American comedies of all time. Directed by Howard Hawks, this is the best of the set (in my opinion).

Only Angels Have Wings (1939)-another funny one, also directed by Howard Hawks, with Jean Arthur as Cary's love interest, is an Andes Mountain adventure of planes and past loves and lots of comedic drama. It flows very smoothly and provides great entertainment from beginning to end. It has a great supporting cast-Thomas Mitchell, Richard Barthelmess, a young and beautiful Rita Hayworth-and thrilling suspense. A great movie.

Holiday (1938)-one of the four Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn movies, not their best (The Philadelphia Story and Bringing Up Baby are even better) but still wonderful. It is touching and funny, with tender and sweet moments, and more of a love story than the others in this set. It's a great New Year's Eve movie, with Cary's Johnny Case engaged to Kate's black sheep millionaire heiress, and family drama abounds. One of the many Hepburn movies directed by George Cukor.

The Awful Truth (1937)-A great balance of equal parts romance and comedy, starring Irene Dunne (in an Oscar-nominated performance) as the Cary's almost-divorced wife, and they are both planning to remarry, although their crazy screwball antics may end up ruining both of their plans. Nominated for Best Picture Oscar and winner of Best Director for Leo McCarey (also nominated for Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Ralph Bellamy as Irene's new love interest), this is one of the best screwball comedies of all.

The Talk of the Town (1942)-This is the only one of the set that I haven't seen-I'm a newbie Grant lover, and I plan to watch the one I got in the set, but I'm sure it's wonderful as well. It has a great director-George Stevens, Jean Arthur again, who is really very funny and underrated, also Ronald Colman starring as a law professor in line for the Supreme Court. It was nominated for 7 Oscars, including Picture, Original Story, and Screenplay, and the basic plot is that Grant has recently escaped from prison and is staying with Jean Arthur, while Colman is already a guest. Supposed to be very funny, and I am sure it is.

Again, this set is for those who are either looking to be introduced to Cary Grant-what a perfect collection of movies, for those who only own one or two of the movies, or for those who just love Holiday that much. If you are waiting out for the single disc of Holiday, by all means, e-mail the studio and complain and make noise and do big things to make it happen, but don't create a false idea that this set is awful for those who aren't Cary Grant die-hard fans (when I wrote this review, the set was rated 2 and a half stars, which is not even close to how high the quality is).

2463553,1,B000CEV3L4,I have also already purchased all of the other disks in the set.  I am agravated that sony would be so short-sighted and not realize that many classic movie fans will have already done this also.  Please e-mail Sony and advise them of your dissatisfaction with this release.,1139529600,18,274,4.6875
2463554,1,B000CEV3L4,"The essence of Sony/Columbia's crackerjack marketing team can be summarized by this shameless exploitation of the classic film buyer. They take 4 old titles that have been available for a while, and any serious Cary Grant fan already has them, and add the one new one to the group as available in the box only.

BOYCOTT THIS SHAM OF A RELEASE.

If they had made HOLIDAY available alone separately, then there would be nothing to complain about, except for Sony's very late to the party attempt to mock the fine boxed sets that certain of their competitors started marketing to great success years ago...but hey....that's showbiz.

Don't support their ignorance, and disrespect for the consumers, until each title, specifically HOLIDAY, is available at a reasonable price....snd even then..beware the mediocre transfers.",1139443200,19,819,5.236641221374046
2463555,1,B000CEV3L4,Someone should find a contact email address for SONY so people can complain that HOLIDAY is not coming out [yet] on DVD for the US.  What are they thinking????,1139270400,9,159,4.482758620689655
2463556,5,B000CEV3L4,"I went to order this box set and it said that i wouldnt recieve it untill after the 7th of feb because Holiday was not yet on single dvd release. so that will be the date when all those Holiday fans can buy it as a single like I will.

I adore this film and it'l be an excellent addition to my classics collection. must see!",1139011200,6,324,3.909090909090909
