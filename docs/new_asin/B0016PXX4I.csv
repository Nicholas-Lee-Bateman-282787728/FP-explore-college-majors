8470661,2,B0016PXX4I,"due to the fact of the leaving the states 10 years ago, and lost track of my team. so i saw this package, grabbed a six pack and prepare to mwatch riggins clobber miami. well total waste of time. first it w2as  only 45 minutes, and 7 minutes for the superbowl. this should have been called road to superbowl. a bumpy season with a strike, and joe theisman narrating, hoping to get an emmy. I will keep it, but skin fans it really is a dud.",1522713600,,439,4.104651162790698
8470662,5,B0016PXX4I,"Great products! It recaps the season heading up to the super bowl. It doesn't feature the whole game, but it does have interviews of the players. Great buy!",1417305600,,156,4.607142857142857
8470663,1,B0016PXX4I,"This product is advertised as Super Bowl XVII, and was the reason I had purchased it for my husband (one of only two Super Bowls he never got to see).  After finally watching the DVD, it contained less than 10 minutes about the Super Bowl and was more about the Redskins season leading up to the Super Bowl. What a waste of money!  He already knew about the season and the team!  This was truly not as advertised!
Now I still have to search for a copy of the WHOLE game!",1366243200,5,470,4.142857142857143
