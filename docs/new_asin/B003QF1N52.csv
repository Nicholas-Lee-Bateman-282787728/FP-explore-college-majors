There are many moments in this movie that have the potential of being sappy or overacted or dumb, but the director did a great job of not allowing any of that to happen.

I decided to buy this DVD for my best friend as a belated birthday present because I know he's gonna LOVE IT too. :O) I have seen it about 11 times now, just finished it a few mins ago",1297987200,,249,3.8076923076923075
4168286,5,B003QF1N52,"So I just watched the movie Legendary today with WWE Star John Cena. This movie is the story of a family, the Chetney family who has been through quite a bit of turmoil. The main characters, Mike and Cal (John Cena, and Devon Graye) are brothers that have been torn apart by family tragedy when their father died in a car accident while Mike was still in High School and Cal was just an infant. Cal is now in high school and isn't the same popular guy his brother was, rather than that he is the class nerd. He knows about his brother, but doesnt really ""know"" him at all.

Mike was an All-American and 3 time state champion wrestler in their home state of Oklahoma, and Cal decides much like his brother, and late father, that he wants to pick up the family tradition of wrestling and bring the family back together through the sport. Mike has been in and out of trouble and it takes him, after some convincing, to come back and help his brother become the wrestler he once was.

The movie was an amazing film and really did a great job of showing the dramatic side of the family and the stress that happened between them as their fathers death seperated them for years, but a common sport and interest healed the wounds and reunited them. This is a great family film that provides laughs, tears, sorrow, and feel-good emotions throughout. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to see one of those uplifting films that really leaves you feeling good at the end.",1296604800,,1467,4.42962962962963
4168287,5,B003QF1N52,"i have not seen cena in movie FRED but it wasn't about him or by wwe but i will still look for it to watch.

now onto main reason wrestling fan or not you will like this movie wwe movies are getting better with each one they release in theaters or direct to dvd i think this was theater for short time but i missed it i watch it today it was great you thinnk you know what is going to happen at the end but it surprrises you what the end result is if you like drama movies you will like danny glove has short parts but hes good in it.

if your fan of wwe films or cena himself i recomend buying this but if your one those people who act like critic, criticizes every little thing and not watch movie for what it is then i don't know i don't criticize movies i watch bad movies with bad effects, bad dubbing with english i happen to like them, and i alos like movies that are good dark night, titanic.

i leave criticizing up to people who get paid to do it the critics them selves keep an open mind if your one those hard critic people that do not get paid to judge movies by 5 stars, or 1 star leave to the critics only movie are meant to entertain if your only watching movies to judge every littel detail then your missing out on fun, adventure, fantasy, most of all experiance to see a new world or learn soemthing new in world titanic for example",1296259200,,1351,4.014869888475836

4168289,5,B003QF1N52,This is a GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!! My sons have wrestled for 13 years so the fact that it included the sport of wrestling was icing on the cake. It's great to see the sport get some lime light as well. I would recommend it to everyone - if you enjoyed the Blindside you will enjoy this movie!!! If you enjoy high school wrestling your will enjoy this movie!!!! If you don't you will enjoy this movie and gain respect for the sport. It is the kind of movie you want to buy so you can watch it again and share it with friends and family.,1294012800,,535,4.104761904761904
4168290,4,B003QF1N52,"After being an ex-Marine & a New Orleans detective, John Cena returns to another WWE film with ""Legendary.""  The movie revolves about a book-smart teenager named Calvin Chetley a.k.a. ""Cal"" (Devon Graye) who goes to high school in Oklahoma, lives with his mom Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), has a female best friend name Lulu (Madeleine Martin) who clearly has more than just ""friendship"" feelings for him which he's obivious to, and developed a friendship with an older man (Danny Glover) who looks out for him with good advice.  He goes out for the wrestling team knowing the history with his brother & late-father having success in the sport, despite the fact that his mother is against it, but just has no luck at it.  On the other side is Cal's brother Mike (Cena) who is a former All-American but very distant from his family, hard on his luck, and somehow keeps getting into trouble.  Cal asked Mike to help train him initially & refused until Cal helped him out in court causing Mike to return the favor & train Cal leading to the brothers bonding together & Cal having better success wrestling.  However they both still have to deal with issues throughout the movie like facing the issue that caused Mike to be so distant from not just Cal but his mother, Lulu & Cal's relationship evolving into something more, and Mike's past catching up to him.

This movie was unlike any previous WWE film in that this wasn't an action based movie as it was more focused on being a more serious family drama.  Cena's role in the movie was very similar to Mr. Kennedy's (now Mr. Anderson in Total Nonstop Action wrestling) role in a previous WWE film ""Behind Enemy Lines: Columbia"" where he played more of a supporting role than the main character he was in his previous two movies.  I think this was definately Cena's best acting effort as his first two movies had him playing the sterotypical strong ""superman"" good guy while he showed diversity here with him playing a guy who clearly had some emotional issues with a bad attitude in the first half of the film.  The acting with everyone else was very good & the best cast put together for a WWE film to date along with the multiple stories being told throughout the film.  In the end, I enjoyed the movie & stories being told (I've personally had a situation like this happened to me so I could heavily relate) so I would recommend this for a viewing.",1290643200,9,2397,4.605633802816901
4168291,5,B003QF1N52,Movie was a good family movie but I did not get the movie from here the guy said it just didn't arrive. I waited three weeks and then e mailed him and he refunded my money so I went to wal mart and bought it. I was really surprised there wasn't even an explanation on why I didn't received it.,1287187200,2,293,3.9
4168292,3,B003QF1N52,"""I told their father I'd watch out for them if anything ever happened to him ?"" That sounds a lot like a line you'd here in a war movie doesn't it ? Legendary isn't a war movie though, it's about high school wrestling. Yet, when Cal Chetley (Devon Graye) reveals to his mother Sharon (Patricia Clarkson) that he wants to join the wrestling team, she reacts as if he said he wants to join the marines.

  Cal's brother Mike (John Cena) and his father were so into wrestling that the father died in a car accident on the way to scope out one of Mike's opponents. So Mike is now a drunk bar fighting loner that keeps himself as far away from his family as possible due to blaming himself. When Cal needs to get better at wrestling, he goes see Mike behind his mother's back. Mike is hard to convince at first, but of course Cal eventually gets his help.

  Cal becomes more confident, gets a girlfriend and takes on his bullies, no this isn't the Karate Kid. The film is over the top sentimental, but it won me over anyway due to Graye and yes John Cena having chemistry. The film even got a tear or 2 out of me.

  Cena, I found surprisingly solid in the first half. I bought that he was a troubled man and he was better than usual and I almost believed that he could act. In the second half when he becomes nicer and a role model, he just phones in his performance and is about as wooden as he usually is in movies. Madeleine Martin however was adorable as Cal's girlfriend. Legendary may not be original but compared to all the other WWE films it's the best. It's a good family film.",1285632000,13,1583,4.232558139534884

I will admit right here and now that I am a fan of John Cena's movies, yes it is true. I thought ""The Marine"" was a fun pointless action movie and that ""12 Rounds"" while seeming like a ""Die Hard"" spin off was just as fun. This was Cena's third film for WWE and I have to say that it may be his best. It is a realistic drama in which John had to actually act and he was in a co starring role. For some reason when this first came out I wanted to see this more so than any other he had been in.

Cal Chetley [Devon Graye] is one of those kids who is just an outcast and is having problems at home. His mother [Patricia Clarkson] is over protective, his father is dead, and his older brother [Cena] is the black sheep of the family. While he is a scrawny guy he wants to join the schools wrestling team like his father and brother did before him. the thing is he knows nothing about it and his mother is strongly against it.

Now I know some of you are reading that and are saying ""that does not sound to interesting"". Well if you were thinking that then you would be very wrong for thinking that, especially seeing Cena in this type of film. I have to say that I was very impressed by John here in this film as the brother who has to come back to help his little bro. He is actually really good here especially during the first half of the film. Seeing him play the drunk outcast haunted by his past it is new side of Cena. The last half is more of the guy that you see in the WWE helping out kids and such. Don't get me wrong the role called for that but still.

Devon is really good here in the lead role and makes the film more believable. And for any out there that says a kid like that would never make it in amateur wrestling has no idea what they are talking about. As someone who wrestled all throughout school and trains it every day even now I can tell you the little guys are usually the nastiest and most hard workers. Was I one of those guys, maybe, maybe not. Patricia is also excellent here as their mother and Danny Glover is always fun.

I was glad to see Mel Damski directed this since he is a producer and directed many episodes of one of my favorite shows of all time, ""Psych"". Also it should be noted that the writer of this film John Posey is also in the film as Coach Tennent. He did a good job on both fronts. Anyway this is actually a good film from the WWE and is one of the few dramatic films they have made. I say give the film a chance, I liked it.",1359331200,,2486,3.993963782696177

4168505,4,B003QF1N52,"I frankly like John Cena more everytime I watch him, and this movie was the best I've seen him in.
First, I confess that I have actually been involved with real, collegiate, folkstyle wrestling for over 30 years, and this was my reason for the initial attraction to the movie.  Also, as any 'real' wrestler (which in the WWA or whatever it is, Cena is not) will look at most any wrestling film with a very dubious eye -- the moves and motions of most of the wrestlers are phony and disturbing.  The main character, Cena's younger brother, is a pretty unphysical, skinny kid who seems to have no athletic background, and certainly no wrestling experience: this shows throughout, and doesn't really improve even to the end.  His opponents he wrestles are real, but have to stop their real wrestling so he can do stuff that would never work against any wrestler who is any good: that's ok, as you can't expect a real actor to have a lot of real wrestling experience.  It's just disturbing to watch someone who really stinks at wrestling (Cal), so obviously, get into the finals of a regional tournament in Oklahoma, when his wrestling is really on the JV level.  You can tell the kid he wrestled in the finals was the real deal to some degree, and had this been an actual match, it would have ended seconds into the match.
So ok, that was secondary to the actual conflict as the movie evolved.  The real conflict is quite moving as Cena is brought back to real life from the dark depths of guilt and a lifestyle that is pitiful for someone who was once so huge in real life and so successful at wrestling.
I did enjoy watching Cena teach his younger brother wrestling, and was curious about how he would teach it, since in reality, I don't think he has wrestled folkstyle -- he showed moves, but nothing that really required a lot of wrestling skill.  But he worked on other stuff that were real training devices, and did so as a good big brother, which was emotionally uplifting.
There's a lot of lingering guilt and pain in this movie, which is resolved really well, and will be equally satisfying and emotionally involving to anyone, whether they have wrestled or not, or even like the sport.  Its really about a very conflicted mother, full of suppressed pain, and her younger (much younger than Cena) son, who has been untouched by any of the pain, but who is ultimately responsible for catalyzing its resolution.
I admit to having some lumps in my throat as Cena was reconnected to his family and the real world where he belonged.
What I do not know is if this movied is based on actual truth....??",1322438400,,2601,4.53091684434968
4168506,3,B003QF1N52,"Mel Damski, the director of this flick, has a history comprised almost entirely of work in television and it shows here. This is a short putt from being an 'after school special.'

Here's the scoop. Cal Chetley is a bright, good-hearted high school student. He lives with mom. Dad died in a car accident some years earlier. His older brother hasn't been around in years. He has a casual, but affectionate, relationship with a very sweet and left of center neighbor named Luli. As the bookish type he tends to be put upon by  some of his school chums. He wants to join the school wrestling team to help beef up his physical confidence and hopefully bring his brother back to the family who, himself, was a championship wrestler. It's a tough road.

This is a well intended, paint by numbers endeavor. There are few surprises but I didn't really care much because I liked the characters. Patricia Clarkson, as the mom, is always good and she does well with what she's given. John Cena is decent as the big brother. He's separated himself from his family for reasons which are made clear later in the movie. He's a laborer who lives in a trailer, drinks and fights a lot which leads to issues with the law, and has a string of girlfriends with whom he cannot become intimate. Will he help coach little brother to a title and will he get back with the family and kill the demons inside of him? Danny Glover is one of the locals and provides the voice of reason to Cal, played nicely by Devon Grey. Madelein Martin, as Luli Stringfellow, is a hoot. She's as sweet as can be and has a sense all her own. She marches to a different drummer and has a thing for Cal.

Like I said, there is no ground being broken here. You've seen it all before and it sets out to manipulate the audience which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I like being led around by the nose, particularly in something such as this where you want these people to succeed. They're good people trying to get their lives back on track. This is a decent watch for a family type, PG-13 kind of movie.",1322179200,,2065,4.412073490813648
4168507,5,B003QF1N52,"This review is short and sweet.  The story line followed the general flow of movies like this. However, it had a few twists and the bad guy was not so bad and the mean mother became understanding the the boy brought them together, got a girlfriend and the ""water pump"" he wanted (you will see it about 4 times)LOL.
Worth a purchase. Good clean movie, great acting, with a feel good storyline with likeable characters and even the ""so so"" bad guys end up loosing.",1315008000,,462,4.435294117647059
4168508,2,B003QF1N52,"I purchased this DVD because my family is into high school wrestling. This movie presents the bully situation of youth and all the survival odds of loneliness, abandonment, low self esteem issues, etc... as many ""family movies"" do; however, it lacks any glue to hold and maintain your interest. I gave it to my wrestling grandsons who thought it was awful and could not finish watching it. I also tried to watch it but had to stop. It was just too boring and predictable with  a theme that has been done to death. Perhaps it would be ok for a TV after school special movie for children.",1314835200,3,586,4.4766355140186915
4168509,3,B003QF1N52,"This film isn't really about wrestling; it's about the main character's journey into manhood.  In the beginning, we meet Cal, a string-bean of a young man, who has some fire in him but doesn't know how to channel it.

Cal is somewhat in the shadow of his big (and buff) brother played by John Cena, who is known throughout their hometown as a former high school wrestling champion.  Their father has died, and Cal decides to go out for the wrestling team to understand what his father loved about the sport.  It also provides a chance to re-connect with his long-estranged brother, Cena.

Unlike other loud, shoot-'em-up, WWE movies, Legendary is a surprisingly quiet, family film about one boy's dream to prove he can wrestle and his desire to connect with a brother he clearly idolizes.

Cena's acting is solid in the film, proving he can do more than play an action hero.  Danny Glover plays a local who just happens to be around when Cal needs advice and encouragement.  At one point, I found myself wondering if Glover was supposed to be God or an angel because his character gives an aura of peace and unselfish fatherly love.

This movie stands out due to a lack of sex and foul language--a rare trait it most recent films.  The one glitch is an early scene with Cal's quirky girlfriend who allows some schoolboys to see her breasts.  The scene is shot from the back so all you see are the boys reactions, but I believe the movie lost points with parents--especially moms--for this scene.  It adds nothing, and in my opinion, the scene should have been cut.

One thing the film lacks is a real sense of what Cena's character was like prior to seeing his little brother again. We know he is laid off work, and he gets in a couple of fights, but otherwise, we never see him self-destruct.  In an early scene, he warns Cal that no one should be around him, but we never see him do anything foolish.  I think the film could have explored Cena's drinking problem a little more, as it was hinted at in several scenes.

The downside of the film is that it often felt like a Hallmark or movie-of-the-week type flick rather than a major motion picture.  Still, I think that Legendary has the potential to endure as a solid, family movie geared toward fathers, sons and brothers.",1310774400,,2276,4.53921568627451
4168510,3,B003QF1N52,"I was a bit disappointed with Legendary.  After seeing the movie trailer I was really hyped up and excited to see an extremely well-written drama, with a refreshing spin on the age old tale of triumph over obstacles.  It just sort of never rose to the occasion or my expectations.  The acting talent was strong, and the movie touched on several important life values and issues.  However, the material/script needed a little more umph!  Also everything was just so dark and depressing.  Altogether it was ok.",1302220800,,508,4.848837209302325
