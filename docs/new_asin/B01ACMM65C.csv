It goes to show that not all athletes are self-centered, and that its possible to care about and even have some empathy about the rest of the world.  i strongly believe it should be required viewing for all young athletes and wanna-be athletes.  not to mention the absolute perfect father's day gift!!",1462320000,,386,4.907692307692308
