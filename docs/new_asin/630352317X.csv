There's no music, it makes no attempt to be heartwarming and the narrator sounds more like a biologist talking about the animals and less like a professional actor reading an artfully written script.  The video offers a tour through many different kinds of penguins, many that are rarely shown in videos of this kind.  He tells a little about each and shows some fantastic footage.

Aside from seeing the animals, you learn next to nothing about them, besides what they are.  None of the usual barage of information and factoids you expect from educational videos.  Furthermore, only about one third of the video has anything to do with penguins.  The other two thirds is about other animals, such as seals, whales, and other birds.  I got the video to learn and see penguins, and I was rather dissapointed by the lack of focus on them.  And as I said before, there's little information about them, I learned more from books I read in grade school....",976147200,8,672,4.741379310344827
