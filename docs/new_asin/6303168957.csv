601968,2,6303168957,This  film is o.k and features the great Icelandic actress MARIA ELLINGSEN from the soaop SANTA BARBARA as the female coach of the Icelandic hockey team.,1016064000,,153,4.884615384615385
601969,5,6303168957,This must b the best video i've ever seen. It is sooooooooooooooo good I completely love it to bits. I had watched the mighty ducks first and then i got this for my christams and i've watched it everyday since. I love it 2 pieces. I can't wait 2 see the mighty ducks 3. It sounds good. I really want 2 see it. The actors are brillant. Adam Banks is cuter than ever. I so want 2 see number three. From what i've read it sounds good. Come on people tell me more.,1009756800,,460,3.956989247311828
601970,5,6303168957,"D2..The Mighty Ducks are back is the best movie ever. Emilio Estevez gives a performance that is Oscar worthy. His portrayal of the determined Gordon Bombay is nothing short of breath-taking. Emilio completely becomes Gordon Bombay in his most convincing role to date. Aside from Emilio, a young Joshua Jackon (aka Pacey from Dawson's Creek) shows glimpses of superstardom in his role as the young, caring Charlie Conway. When Charlie is willing to give up his role on the Ducks for the teams good, you WILL Have goosebumps. There is a little bit of Charlie Conway in each and every one of us. This movie also has loads of comedy. First off- The opening scene when they rollerblade through the Mall of America is..in a word..hilarious. Also- A young Kenan (of Nickelodeon fame) introduces the Knuckle Puck in this movie! The action and the laughs never stop in this movie which in a nutshell defined the 1990's and set the standard for all movies.",998870400,14,947,4.780487804878049
601971,5,6303168957,"I think D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS is definitely the best film out of the whole series. I mean, the original and D3 were great, but this one is definitely #1! Bombay and the Ducks are back and this time, they have been asked to represent the USA hockey team for the Junior Winter/Summer Olympics held in L.A.! They also get some new teammates, as well, and they are all from different states in the country. At first, the Ducks and the new players can't seem to get along. But of course, soon they become fast friends.
When they get to the Olympics, they face their biggest rival team - last year's championship team from Iceland. They are tough, bigger, faster, and much more competive, especially their coach. The USA team does very well in the beginning, but then they loose to the Iceland team bad. Soon, all Coach Bombay cares about is winning - and the USA team can't stand that! So when they take a day off, they meet up with these street hockey kids who teach them how to really play hockey and what it really takes to be a team. And their spirits suddenly start to grow, especially after Coach Bombay apologizes to them for acting like such a jerk. Finally, it is the championships and they have to face Iceland once again. Do they win? Why, of course!
D2 is much more hilarious than the first, and the kids play more practical jokes and tricks. The hockey games are excellent, even though of course probably most of the hockey players you see on the ice are stunt doubles. Still, a great movie and a must see and a must have if you own and loved the first one! The Quack Attack is back and better than ever!",989798400,5,1611,4.355481727574751
601972,1,6303168957,"first off this movie ISN'T for kids!! i can't stress that enough scenes deleted from the original such as when Aberman is skating down the escalator at the mall and his sleeve gets caught and proceeds to rip his arm off while charlie cries over his bloody corpse, or when Ken Wu (a new player) duct tapes a butcher knife to his hockey stick and does a triple axle leaving two iceland players decapitated while Fulton and Portman, ""The Bash Brothers"", deflacate on their corpses.  Don't let your kids see it check the box to make sure it's the edited one!!!",974073600,3,556,4.5049504950495045
601973,5,6303168957,"This is the best Mighty Ducks movie!  Unlike what most people say, this is not a repeat of the first, it is totaly different!  And you just gotta love that knuckle-puck!",971827200,,169,4.419354838709677
601974,3,6303168957,"The hockey purist could be offended at the on ice antics of ""Team USA"" as it takes on opponents in an international competition. From the new character ""Cowboy,"" rope tying opponents to figure skater  Ken Wu trying to get through the defense with a ""triple axle,"" it  is as far fetched as any youth sports movie has ever gotten. Estevez was  clearly in this only for the money and if you notice ""Team USA,""  supposedly the best teen players in the country, doesn't even skate that  well!
The rivalry between Estevez and the Icelandic coach is believable  and Disney including some inner city kids to develop the plot is admirable.  The ending is enjoyable especially when a least likely character is allowed  to shine.  Kids, hockey fans or not, will love it and that is who the  ""Duck"" series was designed for. As an adult you really better  suspend your belief in this one. But then again, isn't that what movies are  supposed to be about anyway?",946252800,3,948,4.610778443113772

602577,4,6303168957,"I'm not the biggest fan of sequels, especially when it comes to kids movies as they generally go ""off the rails"".  I'm happy to announce that this is an exception to that awful trend.  While a number of kids didn't return for this second installment of the Mighty Ducks, I'm glad to see the ones I cared about hung in there.  Some cool new characters filled in the gap and they were obviously different at first but ultimately blended in nicely with the existing group...I credit Emilio Estevez because it seemed that as he was coaching the characters, he seemed to be coaching the young actors in the craft and it seemed to be working.  Kathryn Erbe is forever type-cast as Detective Alexandra Emes on Law and Order:  Criminal Intent in my book (I'm sure most people who view these films for the first time won't be in the L&O fanbase just yet) so this was a distracting factor for me, but she's a good actress so I'll let that slide.  Michael Tucker was wonderfully annoying as Team USA's sponser and I wonder if I was the only one who felt gleeful when he crashed  while learning how to skate.  I think ultimately there were two things I really didn't like about this film.  First, Ty O'Neal's character was ""too southern"" for my taste...I wonder how many people behave like he did in this film and play hockey.  I'm sure there are plenty of southern-born hockey players, but with his exaggerated mannerisms...I don't know.  Second, Joss Ackland was noticibly absent as Gordan's mentor and was replaced by Jan Rubes, who played his brother.  Rubes wasn't bad by any means, but I've become attached to the former...maybe having them both in the film together would have been great, but this arrangement we saw left a noticible emptiness for me.  On the other hand, there were plenty of new actors who made me very happy.  Elden Henson and Aaron Lohr will be the ""Bash Brothers"" forever in my heart and mind and Justin Wong's attempt to be as tough as them was pretty cool...they must have thought so too because they dubbed him their ""Little Bash Brother"".  Shaun Weiss was also fun to watch, though he can never top the scene from the first film where he has an exchange of words with Coach Bombay while taped to the goal.  Overall, this is a solid sequel and didn't go ""sideways"" as many sequels of kids movies sadly do.  If you enjoyed the first one, you will definetly enjoy this as well.",1378857600,,2394,4.543123543123543
602578,4,6303168957,"In this the second installment of the ducks story Coach Emilio Estevez returns to town from his stint in minor league hockey with a hurt leg.  He is asked to coach the United States Junior Team at the Goodwill Games in Los Angles.  His old team is reassembled and they trek to L.A. where they encounter a cast of carictures which includes line dancing on the ice, uye ha!

After losing a game to the new Evil Empire (Iceland) they aspire to get back to basics and are taken to task by a street-tuff roller hockey team featuring a young and mouthy Keenan Thompson.

D2, however is one of the few that hold strong with the original Mighty Ducks film.  Most of the young stars return in this film, and those who do not are replaced by much more interesting team members, including a bash brother and a hog-tying cowboy.

Emilio Estevez returns as hockey coach Gordon Bombay who's returned to the Ducks after an injury in the minor leagues which has prevented a future in the NHL, although he is quickly back on his feet when he is asked to be the coach for the USA team in the Goodwill games. With the infusion of a few new players, some exciting new drills and a lot of hard work the ducks are back in action and ready to kick some Iceland butt!

602689,3,6303168957,"'D2: The Mighty Ducks' released in '94 is the second installment in the adventures of Coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) and his misfit team of teenage hockey overachievers. After his shot at a professional hockey career is ended by a knee injury Gordon returns to the Mighty Ducks with a new vision of hockey glory. They have been chosen to join Team U.S.A. at the Junior Goodwill Games to be played at the Arrowhead Pond in California. Isn't Disney so predictable. Several outstanding Junior players from across the country are added to the team which adds some uncomfortable situations with the rest of the Ducks, but eventually they unite take on the hockey world like only the Mighty Ducks could.

Emilio Estevez does an admirable job reprising the role of Gordon Bombay and Carsten Norgaard is a terrific bad guy as the unethical Coach Wolf Stansson of Team Iceland.

`D2' has numerous funny moments and the cast is so energetic and enthusiastic you tend to overlook a lot of the obvious faults and inconsistencies in the plot. Little kids will love it, but older teens and adults probably won't make it to the end. Too many silly antics for my taste.",1152230400,,1159,4.7611940298507465

The one thing that killed me more than all of this was the last penalty shot of the game.

602747,5,6303168957,"this movie rules cause it reminds me of my fun childhood where i did nothing but eat mcdonalds and watch disney movies like this. i like when they goto LA and they meet the new crew of badass 14 year old hockey players. and that one kid gets a friend and mr. bigglesworth ahhaha calls them the smash brothers. the icelands guys are scary but the assistant coach is hot. thats why gordon bombay AKA emilio estevez went to eat ice cream with her but the smash brothers saw him and they got mad. she was like greenland is full of ice and iceland is very nice. thats her line in the whole damn movie.
i like the cowboy kid from texas who has the rope on a DAMN HOCKEY RINK for some reason. and he doesnt know how to say rodeo drive in beverly hills. and then golberg says he's tori spellings cousin so he goes into this expensive store and gets all the models to wear clothes for him cause he says its for his mother. but then he says how about bikinis and the lady throws them out.
charlie is a downer in this movie. not like d1 where hes this cool kid, or liek in d3 where he meets the girl at his new school and hes like i love pizza and Slayer (yes the metal band) and i don't smoke. o my god thats so annoying give me more golberg scenes.
best part though is when team USA plays the ghetto kid from good burger and kenan n kel. and the goals are trash cans and they play on top of a building. i had no idea ghetto LA had a street hockey scene. and they he shows them the knuckle puck and all the team USA kids are like 'no way man!' and then some team USA kid tells kenan's bro that kenan has a big mouth and he looks at him and hes like 'ya he does have a big mouth doesnt he'.

602748,4,6303168957,"Released in 1994, D2 THE MIGHTY DUCKS is the first sequel to THE MIGHTY DUCKS. Continuing the story of the young Ice Hockey team and their coach Gordan Bombay (Emilio Estevez), we now have the team representing the USA at the Junior Goodwill Games as Team USA. Their main rivals this time round are the Iceland team. Along with the fun and mayhem that the Ducks cause during their time in Beverly Hills where the games are played, we have Gordon Bombay caught up in the success that he is currently having. You see, Team USA have a corporate sponsor who wants coach Bombay to do a lot of publicity, thus affecting his time with the Ducks. However by the end of the movie he learns that he needs to standby the Ducks in order for them to win and be Champions at the games.
Initially we are reintroduced to some of the teenagers from the first movie. It is here that we discover who from the first film is not returning. Lucky for us we meet some new members of the team, and they are a lot more interesting than the ones who are missing. Of the newcomers, one is a goalie who can save virtually every shot made at her; another is extremely big and strong (but gets a little too carried away sometimes); another is a cowboy who uses a rope to round up players; one is a fantastic skater; and one is extremely fast, only problem is once he starts he has a real problem with stopping. All these new players greatly add to the fun of D2 THE MIGHTY DUCKS.
As with many sports movies there is a lot of inspiration and this comes from the script, the dedicated acting and directing, and from the music which though repetitive is catchy and very awe-inspiring.
All three of the Mighty Ducks movies are awe-inspiring and it just depends on your personal preference as to which one is the best. For me personally, my favorite is D3 THE MIGHTY DUCKS, but D2 THE MIGHTY DUCKS is a close second. As well as seeing Emilio Estevez, watch out for Joshua Jackson (Pre-Dawson's Creek) as the captain of the Mighty Ducks.
There are no special features on this DVD, but the movie is in widescreen. However, the movie itself makes it worth buying so let's be thankful for small favors.",1048204800,,2163,4.396508728179551

While in LA they meet another new member of the team Russel who joins when Adam gets injured..ok i'm giving to much away but to find out exactly what happens...WATCH It!!!",1029369600,,683,4.516129032258065
602753,4,6303168957,"I thought that D2 was a good movie, although some of the parts seemed to be unrealistic, and some main characters from The Mighty Ducks were missing.  I missed Hans, though I did really like his ""replacement"".  One of the bigger missing characters, I thought, was Ms. Conway, Charlie's mother.  I think that if you're going to introduce a sort-of-main character in the first movie, you should stick with it in the second.
  In D2, the Ducks get accepted into the Goodwill Olymipic Games.  They get some new players who they aren't getting along with to well in the beginning, but who they sort their differences out with.  In the Olympics, they go up against teams from all over the world, but with none are they so competetive than with the favored-to-win team, Iceland.
  The coach of the Iceland team is sort of like Coach Riley in D1, but is, I think, more extreme.  Coach Bombay has kind of the same ""screw up"" that he had in D1, but another old man, who is filling Hans' place in his hockey store when the owner is absent, helps Bombay sort things out.
  In the end of the movie, Iceland and the U.S are set up in the big final game.  Who wins?  Well, I can't tell, but it's a great ending.
