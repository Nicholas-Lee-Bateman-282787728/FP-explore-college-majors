2197107,4,B0006Z2KQQ,I love this DVD!!  If you have children you will enjoy and relate to his style of comedy.  I like his delivery-he is calm and smooth and uses family situations that we all deal with for his presentation.  My husband and I enjoyed this DVD and plan on having friends over to view it again.,1228003200,,288,4.2
2197108,4,B0006Z2KQQ,"This is my 3rd exposure to Jeff Allen & while I think there are funnier pieces that he has done, this was a quality stand-up comedy routine in the ""Bananas"" show format.  Jeff is clean & presents humor straight from his own life.  I got his as a gift for my husband & we watched it together & had lots of real laughter.  I personally preferred the material from ""Happy Wife, Happy Life"", but this was good, clean fun & I would recommend it.",1168473600,5,440,4.214285714285714
2197109,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"I had watched the Bananas special with Jeff Allen on it, but I wanted to see more, so I bought this DVD.  It had a little more funny stuff on it, but the serious talk he gave for a portion of the show was great too.  This is a seriously funny man that you should check out. One of the best comedians I have ever seen.",1152921600,8,317,3.787878787878788
2197110,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"You will laugh yourself silly!  I was laughing so hard my kids wanted to know what I was laughing at.  They joined me and now we walk around saying many of his punchlines. Billy Graham says on the back of the DVD ""You will be blessed..""  He was right.",1138233600,10,251,4.081632653061225

2197114,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"Jeff Allen uses sarcasm to describe everyday events and relationships.  He is extremely funny and clean.  If you want great entertainment that the whole family can enjoy, this is it!  I love the way that the ""Bananas Gang"" shows that you don't have to go to the gutter to get a laugh.",1357862400,,284,4.423076923076923
2197115,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"Jeff Allen is our favorite ""clean"" comedian. His relational humor is hysterical. We currently have teenagers in our house, so we can relate to alot of the things Jeff talks about. Our friend needed her asthma inhaler while watching it with us, because she laughed so hard!",1328400000,,272,4.808510638297872
2197116,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"Best wholesome comedy ever!!!!

The Extended Performance will have you crying in laughter the first 40 minutes and crying in emotion the last 20 minutes as he gives a touching and hard reality to married life both pre Christianity and after receiving Christ along with his own acceptance of Jes=us Christ. Anyone can relate to his stuff, parents raising kids, grandparents, and kids too as they see they're parents thru his comedy. My daughters 14 & 18 love it as well as my wife.
Great job Jeff.",1289174400,,496,4.7011494252873565
2197117,5,B0006Z2KQQ,It is hard to find good clean comedy; and Jeff Allen is great!  Any married couple with growing or grown children will enjoy this ... without even having to wait for the little ones (or grandma) to go to bed!,1276905600,,208,4.2

8043757,5,B0006Z2KQQ,We saw Jeff for the first time at a college function.  We have watched his performances on line but didn't have any of his DVDs.  We enjoyed this as it includes his back story.  A lot of this is what we heard before but we enjoy watching his performances.  You don't have to be afraid to let your children hear this but they may not understand some of the material.  It is relatable for adults.,1500508800,,394,4.2
8043758,5,B0006Z2KQQ,"Without question Jeff is hilarious.  I mainly bought this to have his skit on his old Cadillac car having a ""carburetor made by Hoover.""  Worth every cent.  I highly recommend this video.  It has more than YouTube has of his stuff.

Best of all, he has CLEAN humor for a pleasant change from obnoxious tasteless mainstream profane attempts at comedy.  (Yes, George Carlin and Richard Pryor will always be exceptions).",1479427200,,417,4.885714285714286

8043765,5,B0006Z2KQQ,Jeff Allen is a great Christian comedian - in some of his work he has offer his testimony of his life as an atheist and how God brought him to the knowledge of His Redeeming Grace. He is among some of the funniest comedians I have seen (and I have seen many).,1415318400,,259,4.0
