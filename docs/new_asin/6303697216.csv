7853149,5,6303697216,"I own three video copies of the film.  I think that John Lone is one of the fifty best actors ever.  Shadow of China is a beautiful film. The charactors in the film are so real.so life-like.  The scenery, dialogue. and acting are brilliant. I loved the music. It's haunting music and scenery of 1980's Hong Kong contribute to the beauty of the film's story line. John Lone is an acting genius.  His portrait of Henry Wong testifies to this artistic genius he possesses. He brings to the role an 'ethereal insouciance'.The Shadow Of China is one of the best films to be produced in Asia for a western audiences along with other masterpieces such as 'Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon',The Sent Down Girl' and Farewell My Concubine"".  This film should be reproduced on DVD.  Anne",1224979200,,773,4.731343283582089

John Lone and Vivian Wu are attractive leads, but the scripting and direction are poor, to say the least.

The clumsy dialogue is played with lines delivered as if chiseled in stone, and there are next to no scenes that really pick up enough to make you forget the school-play-like staging.

When a film makes you cringe each time a 'clever' line is spoken, something is very wrong.

Some beautiful mood shots of cloud-draped Hong Kong appear from time to time, but that is far from enough to carry this one.

This could have been a riveting, even explosive story (given the main character's background), but instead it becomes a casebook example of how not to write and direct a feature film.

Its characters, backdrops, contrasts, and poetic artistry of writing and filmography make me sad that it has not received more commercial acclaim yet I have great satisfaction of having it as one of my secret discoveries.  I watch this film over and over again and have shown it to friends and it always touches off many emotions and stirs alot of discussion.  All I can say is that if you see this movie you will not regret it.  The writing, the complex characters, and the exotic backdrop of Hong Kong make for one helluva good film and this movie delivers BIG TIME!  If you love movies then this is a MUST to see.",1026086400,10,754,4.165517241379311
