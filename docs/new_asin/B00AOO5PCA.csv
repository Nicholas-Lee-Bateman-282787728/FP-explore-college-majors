8555428,2,B00AOO5PCA,"I watched the film in Italian with misspelled English subtitles (which=wich, can't=cont). Sandra (Francesca Faiella) and Guilia are twins who share a consciousness.  Guilia gets killed by ""The Surgeon"" who later hangs himself. Now as an adult and a reporter, she goes back to ""The Surgeon's"" house to film Klaus Kinki (Paolo Ricci) making a gonzo porno with mixed genres.

Sandra senses and sees the ghost of her dead sister....and the killer is back. Then about an hour into the film I went WTF as the genres got mixed. It was like watching an Indian Jones film with Space Aliens.  The genres come together in a sloppy fashion at the end...I think.

The language was a barrier. I didn't like how things unfolded with the clues that they gave, it seemed they just threw stuff at the screen.

PLOT SPOILER: The zombies looked like they came of  the cover of  ""The Freeze"" album (Rapid Reaction).

8555429,4,B00AOO5PCA,"In ""Bloodline"" Tagliavini brings to life a bizarre horror story that has a heavy giallo atmosphere of somber despair, dark sinister shadows reminiscent of slasher movies and the added horrors of supernatural grandiose. The acting is very well done by Indie standards with a very dark and serious story that flows perfectly with the Italian dark humor that plays on elements of satire. The film is subtitled so if you ""don't do subtitles"" then your not going to care for the movie. The effects are awesome and gory in true Italian fashion. There is a slow and steady crescendo in to the story with very little intensity through a lot of the film which allows for a more personal connection with the characters before the nightmare is unleashed but it is so worth the patients. ""Bloodline"" is a wild ride into the pit of hell and excess told in a style only Italian horror can create. I really enjoyed this movie.",1433462400,,911,4.6645962732919255
8555430,1,B00AOO5PCA,"I'm a horror-movie buff, see as many as I can (including the worst of Redbox) - and I say without exaggeration that BLOODLINE is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.  Absolutely scare-free, with an utterly incomprehensible script (not helped by the laughably dreadful translation of subtitles) and acting which is hard to judge because the script itself gives the actors nothing to do.  NOTHING happens, for the first hour, which has something to do with a maniac film director shooting a porno movie on the site of a serial killer's former digs.  In the final half-hour, the long-promised bloodletting-by-a-serial-killer turns (briefly) into a zombie movie (HUH?) - before returning to the boring serial-killer plot... by which point I was fast-forwarding.  (Though not fast enough.)  Decent cinematography is the only thing one could recommend about this utter waste of time.",1375660800,,887,5.21830985915493
8555431,2,B00AOO5PCA,"Not what i expected from itallian horror...boring, i fell asleep 40 minutes in, had to re start from that point next day. Low on the blood and gore but good production quality got the stars..pass on this one you won't miss it.",1373932800,,226,4.404761904761905
8555432,4,B00AOO5PCA,"There are several plotlines running through this great Italian gorefest.  Nobody can deliver in this genre like the Italians, and this doesn't disappoint.  It's twisted, shocking, never boring, and hard to watch at times because of its disturbing nature--exactly what I love & exactly what is surprisingly hard to find.  This is a true gem.",1368316800,2,340,5.1454545454545455
8555433,2,B00AOO5PCA,"Well,If you are a fan of Dario Argento or Lucio Fulci ""ENJOY"" !
This is one subtitled nightmare of a flick,Watched in broad daylight and glanced at internet to calm my nerves during the plot unfolding.
There is twins who communicate,Even when one is dead.
A porno being filmed like a snuff film.
Zombies being made by a madman in a mask with some kind of mean dart gun as a numbing tool.",1363219200,,387,4.315068493150685
8555434,5,B00AOO5PCA,"This was a great Italian Horror film. I am a big fan of giallo & directors such as Fulci, Argento, Bava & More to come out of Italy. This had all the elements that make a great film & the unforgettable Italian vibe that jst works so well. If you like Italian Horror this one is a winner for sure.",1362441600,,296,3.95
8555435,1,B00AOO5PCA,"It would have been best if the movie had stayed in the great beyond, never raising it's boring and ridiculous head above ground. I rented the movie only because the names of Sergio Stivaletti (special effects) and Claudio Simonetti (music) appeared on the cover. But even their contribution couldn't make the experience less painful. I was always thinking that these are 90 minutes of my life that I have wasted for no reason to a film that doesn't know what it is: a zombie film, a possession flick or plain and simple a boring waste of time and money.",1361318400,,553,4.595959595959596
