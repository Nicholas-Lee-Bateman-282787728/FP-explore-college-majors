7911695,3,B00000IYQF,"Hero's Blood was marketed as a martial arts film, but it's really a drama with slight sperts of action.

The film begins with a young woman luring a travler to a mansion.  In the mansion lives Su Ou, the rich daughter of the local terriotry offical.  Su Ou spends the night with the man, but has him killed the next day.  Next, the film flashes back to how Su Ou became this way.  Apparently, her father's palace had been attacked and looted a few years earlier.  She was kidnapped by the gang leader.  Her finace, General Yue, fails to save her when she is kidnaped out of fear, .  But a lower ranking General, Chang attempts to save her.  He fails however, and looses an eye trying.

Later Su Ou discovers that her father has also been captured by the bandits, and can do nothing to save her.  Also, General Yue is captured and fails to stand up for her again at the bandits lair.  Su Ou is advised by her father to stay with the Bandit Leader as his wife.  Feeling betrayed and discarded she stays with him, but eventually begins to enjoy life with him.  Later however, her father assmbles an army and attacks the bandits hideout.  General Chang rescuues Su Ou and is promised to marry her.  Mainly because SU Ou won't take General Yue back due to his cowardness twice in a row.  General Yue becomes enraged by this and is dismissed as the territory general. Later he attacks and kills General Chang the day he and Su Ou are to be married.  SU Ou's father builds her a mansion to help ease her sorrow over her tragic life.  She then begins to behave strangly by having men killed after she sleeps with them. She alos has them fight for her amusment. Like a spite reflex due to her let downs by men close to her.  Eventually Lau Jung, another travler, is lured to the mansion and becomes Su Ou's body guard.  He however, is really there by the hand of General Yue, who wishes Su Ou dead.  Lau Jung falls in love with her however, and must confront General Yue one more time to settle matters.

Well as you can tell their was a complex story to the film, which is a goood thing.  Martial Arts, however, are lacking.  The action was poorly choreographed and dated.  The dubbing was poor and Su Ou tended to faint a little too much for my tastes.  (very girly girl)  Also Su Ou's maid in waiting was a lot cuter then her and it made me wonder why the guys wern't going for her over Su Ou.

The realease company for this DVD is Brentwood Home Video.  They have very few special features, only an art of kung fu biography.(which is strange because this was not a Kung Fu film)

In the end I'd say Hero's Blood won't appeal to hard core martial arts fans.  So if you're looking for that, look elsewhere. The film does have a decent plot however, some nice sets, and good costuming, so it's not a total waste of time.(reason for 3 stars)  Just know that it's really more of a Chinese period piece with very little hard core action.  It held my intrest to the end despite the dubbing.  Doubt it's a keeper though, so buy it as cheap as possible.",1101945600,3,3039,4.290492957746479
7911696,1,B00000IYQF,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this film, unless you want to test your perseverance with an utterly disappointing movie.  Not one of the cast appears to have any martial arts training at all.  The storyline is too weak to rationalize the complete lack of believable action.  Save your money for another title, for an authentic Hong Kong import version DVD.  Or spend it on popcorn.",1081296000,,379,4.611940298507463
7911697,1,B00000IYQF,"This was one of the worst martial arts films I have seen and I am a big fan of Kung fu movies. I got the movie because the price was so cheap. The DVD quality is okay, put the plot and action are not good. There is only a couple of 5 second sword fighting scenes in this movie. A woman is forced to marry her fathers enemy. She eventually grows to love him, but he gets killed. She falls in love again, but finds out this guy was sent to kill her. She has no fight scenes. The couple of sword fighting scenes in the movie aren't worth talking about.",1023321600,,549,3.954954954954955
7911698,3,B00000IYQF,"I haven't seen this movie, but I wanted to contradict the review where the reviewer says this movie is about the sport of ""jugging"".  The jugging movie is The Blood of Heroes, starring Rutger Hauer, Joan Chen, and  Delroy Lindo.  There's no one named Leung or Chai in that movie, so this  Hero's Blood is NOT the same movie.",944524800,2,324,4.440677966101695
