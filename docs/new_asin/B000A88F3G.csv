8076276,5,B000A88F3G,Taboo serie on National Geographic is great and so are the dvds. Both seasons are amazing and worth watching and coming back to them. The are educational and eye opening on other people and other cultures.,1310169600,2,205,4.722222222222222
8076277,5,B000A88F3G,"Sorry to the other reviewer, but yes it's going to be gross and disgusting to people who aren't used to it. I have watched all the episodes and found them very educational and not ""geared towards gore"" in any way. They show facts; it's not made to be something people should watch and feel all happy and cuddly about. It's called taboo for a reason. This series is a great one if you want to learn about people in ways that you won't find on normal shows or the news. This is real life, not the happy ""everything gets solved and is peachy"" in an hour usual tvland stuff.",1265328000,5,570,4.238532110091743
8076278,1,B000A88F3G,"Wow, I guess I'm not certain now WHAT I expected, but this group of shows fell far short. Disappointing would not be a wrong statement. The episodes are long and drawn out and lean towards the gore rather than giving one a glimpse of the taboo's of other cultures and beliefs. The sensationalism gets old fairly quickly and it's been hard to stay awake through whole episodes. Plus, we find ourselves skipping some sections because the subject matter is simply too icky (like the one about eating the family dog.) Come on! Can't this type of thing be done without the bloody overkill? Some things like that are expected, but EVERYthing we've watched so far in the series seems geared strictly towards grossing folks out. Maybe the rest of the shows will improve, but I'm not holding out much hope. Really disappointed in this set which had the potential of being fascinating.",1262131200,,875,4.7631578947368425
