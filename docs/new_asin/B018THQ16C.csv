7554449,5,B018THQ16C,Great show,1469145600,2,10,4.5
7554450,5,B018THQ16C,Love the show!!!!,1468800000,2,17,5.0
7554451,5,B018THQ16C,I stumbled on this show on Netflix and I loved it.  I watched every season and I totally enjoyed them and couldn't wait to see each episode.  It's been two days since I saw the finale and I am still in withdrawal.  If you like some humor with your action adventure then this is a show you should check out.  I saw plenty of familiar faces as guest stars and it was just a fun series.  I've got this DVD box in my wish list but since I don't have the box sold here I cannot comment on the quality and any extras but I will say I thoroughly enjoyed this Canadian show.  I am starting to think that Canada is producing better programming than we are.  I don't know if it's just cheaper to film there or what.  I don't know why US TV doesn't pick up this series.,1468540800,4,758,4.006666666666667
7554452,5,B018THQ16C,love this show!! Glad I found it!,1467849600,2,33,3.857142857142857
7554453,5,B018THQ16C,"Truly one of the very best series in recent television history.  Somehow a cross between Rockford Files, Streets of San Francisco, etc., but updated! Original because of the setting and the characterizations of all of the players!  Jake Doyle is everybody's ""bad boy"", constantly in trouble and always ""crossing the line"".  Constable Leslie Bennett is his foil, but also has her eyes on her foyle, er, Doyle!  Those classic pleading eyes don't lie!  Sometimes hilariously crass and sometimes very sweet, there are some very strong life lessons being delivered at all times, if you look for them. You absolutely will not be able to stop watching from episode to episode. From the sometimes extraordinarily complex, well written scripts to the infectious theme song, this program hits the mark. Oh, and by the time your finished watching the series, you'll be planning your next vacation to Newfoundland!",1467504000,16,902,5.1506849315068495
7554454,5,B018THQ16C,Perfect DVD collection for the biggest fan.,1467331200,2,43,5.285714285714286
7554455,5,B018THQ16C,After seeing some episodes at a friend's house I got engrossed in this show. I am so happy I found all six seasons at once. I never knew anything about Newfoundland. The seller that sold this to me was excellent. I definitely would buy from them again!,1466812800,5,252,4.382978723404255
7554456,5,B018THQ16C,So happy to have been able to have found this on Amazon... a terrific series and I highly recommend it!,1465603200,3,103,4.2
7554457,5,B018THQ16C,Good plots. Excellent cast. Humor in each episode.,1464566400,7,50,5.375
7554458,5,B018THQ16C,A wonderful series and wish there were more.,1522454400,,44,4.625
7554459,5,B018THQ16C,"A funny, private eye comedy with a happy ending!",1521849600,,48,4.444444444444445
7554460,2,B018THQ16C,"Filmed in a lovely location, but it's too bad the horrible writing, directing and acting, block the beautiful views...Lo siento.
Cheers",1521504000,,135,5.476190476190476
7554461,5,B018THQ16C,"love this series. family values like this show represents, we don't really have that kind of values here in USA (anymore). everyone and everything is offensive to everyone. everyone wants their 2cents in how your family should be or how you should raise your children. it's super lame. in short....very re-freshing show.",1521331200,,320,5.173076923076923
7554462,4,B018THQ16C,"I""m giving this 4 stars because of the production value and being able to take a trip down memory lane. Other reviewers have mentioned that this is like watching The Rockford Files.  It is in many ways and that's what I don't like about it. Too cutesy and the gags are very old.  The characters are pleasant enough and the stories are well thought out.  I also agree that the ex-wife should go.  I was tired of her the second time she came on the seam.

If you like P.I. drama/comedies, you might enjoy this. No cursing, no blood to speak of and, in general, nice people.  It's just too old fashion for me.",1519776000,,606,4.271929824561403
7554463,5,B018THQ16C,This was a great series.  I loved all of the characters and the different episodes. I was sorry to see it come to an end but I was extremely happy with the ending.,1519257600,,163,3.9393939393939394
7554464,5,B018THQ16C,"Its funny, got good pace to the show, of course has an amazing ship (Jake/Leslie) dynamic characters and writing. So many good story lines and relationships. Its a hidden gem Im so glad it popped up on my Netflix. Makes me want to visit St. Johns so bad. If you haven't watched this amazing diamond in the ruff you should. Youll not be disappointed.",1518652800,,349,4.46875
7554465,5,B018THQ16C,This series was an unbelievably wonderful surprise.  The actors and the writers were absolutely clever beyond words.  This series is now one of my new favorites.  I am so sad that there are only 6 seasons.  Kudos to the everyone involved in the making of this series.  Job well done!,1514505600,2,283,4.58
7554466,3,B018THQ16C,"How this show was ever nominated for any awards, or lasted 6 seasons is beyond belief. It is juvenile and cute-sy, with an annoying Jar Jar Binks-like character in Des for the first 4 seasons. Then Des is toned down a bit for the last 2 seasons, and the series exhibits more violence. P.I., Jake Doyle's love interest, Sgt. Leslie Bennett, is a weepy and wishy-washy emotional mess who can't make up her mind about anything---for all 6 seasons. One reviewer hit the nail o n the head and stated that the attitudes of cute-sy sexual harassment and hi-jinks are way outdated. The teen antics and attitudes are as outdated as the 40-tr old fashion of the characters. The only reason I gave the series 3 stars instead of less, is due to the fine acting of Lynda Boyd and Sean McGinley (Jake's father and step-mother), and the surprise of appearance of other decent acting such as in Russell Crowe's episode, Megan Follows, Angus Macfadyen, and even Shannon Tweed. The series is a time-filler if you find yourself with nothing to do and need something to pass the time.",1514246400,3,1064,4.634920634920635
7554467,5,B018THQ16C,Got started watching the first two season and couldn't find the remaining seasons. Glad amazon could help us out. Great purchase at a fare price.,1509753600,,145,4.84
7554468,5,B018THQ16C,"Watched the entire series - excellent. A detective series with action, intrigue and rich character development that is worth watching. Hope to see more from the producers and directors.",1509062400,2,185,5.413793103448276
7554469,3,B018THQ16C,"Series started out with engaging and likable characters, but come season two, become more and more annoying and irritating. Jakes being a sex maniac is crude, and guess its time for Jake to bulk up and go shirtless a lot.  Speaking of shirtless, the most intriguing part of the series is will Des have a hairy chest this time or shaved?  In spite of itself, the show does have lots of clever lines and funny, but too much nonsense in between.",1509062400,,442,4.444444444444445
7554470,1,B018THQ16C,"Predictable, performances are not good. Not enjoyable at all",1506729600,2,60,5.777777777777778
7554471,5,B018THQ16C,"Definitely worth binge watching!! Wonderful characters, fun writing... completely enjoyable.",1505001600,3,92,8.3
7554472,5,B018THQ16C,"We'd seen episodes through season four, before acorn tv stopped carrying it, so we were thrilled to find the complete set.  Republic of Doyle is a fun private detective show, set in the beautiful St. John's Newfoundland.  The quality of the dvd's is great and we highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys a more lighthearted version of a detective show.",1504483200,3,358,4.758064516129032
7554473,5,B018THQ16C,Loved this show very much. Great assortment of oddballs and pretty funny.,1504051200,2,73,5.166666666666667

7554475,5,B018THQ16C,"The antics of ""Doyle Family"" were fun to watch.  Some scenes were hilarious!",1500336000,3,76,4.846153846153846
7554476,5,B018THQ16C,"Excellent, humourous series, with Jake always having to get out of something sorry that it came to an end",1498521600,2,105,4.578947368421052
7554477,1,B018THQ16C,"advertised closed captions, but there are none.  very frustrating & disappointing",1496188800,2,81,6.363636363636363
7554478,3,B018THQ16C,"We are currently viewing the 4th season.  If I had given this review during the first season, I probably would have given it just one star - it has definitely improved.  Getting rid of of the distraction of Jake's ex-wife was a big plus - hopefully, the same will happen with Rose's ex-husband.",1489363200,2,294,4.528301886792453
7554479,5,B018THQ16C,We liked the first series enough to order the complete program,1487376000,2,62,4.7272727272727275
7554480,5,B018THQ16C,"Well written & acted with some good humor added to the mix!  I would recommend this show to anyone who likes good acting, good stories and good way to spend an evening. Kudos to Allan Hawco, hope he comes up with something new again....",1486339200,5,236,4.363636363636363
7554481,5,B018THQ16C,"Republic of Doyle is one of the rare series I have ever run across that draws you in and connects you with the characters and then takes you on an adventure you can't turn away from. There is laugh out loud humor, real suspense and thrills, and even some heartache, and never a dull moment in 6 seasons. The creative team, led by Allan Hawco, has given us an outstanding cast and phenominal locations and rolled it up in one of the most entertaining programs ever. Certainly high on the list of all time Canadian programs! I only wish it could have gone another 6 seasons.",1476748800,5,572,4.40566037735849
7554482,5,B018THQ16C,This series is excellent. No extreme violence and a fair amount of humor. If you are old enough to remember The Rockford Files and liked it you will love this. A Canadian version of it only better.,1475884800,6,197,4.351351351351352
7554483,5,B018THQ16C,Excellent series.,1474761600,,17,8.0

7554486,4,B018THQ16C,"Watched the series on CBC and on ACORN--still love it.  But what I want--is the sound track I have seasons 1-3, but I want the last seasons as well",1471737600,,147,4.068965517241379
7554487,5,B018THQ16C,Love the series - Netflix only has Season 1 & 2 - needed to see the rest!,1470441600,,73,3.3529411764705883
8742947,5,B018THQ16C,"This show is so well written and produced and all great actors. It's funny, it's layered. There are several ongoing back stories weaved into each show and I couldn't wait to watch the next one. Watched it a few years back and I'm looking forward to watching all 6 seasons again!",1533513600,,278,4.470588235294118
8742948,5,B018THQ16C,"This is another private eye mystery/thriller with a twist, and that is the humor. There is comedy mixed in with the drama/storyline like no other. It's not slapstick, but more subtle. The characters are well drawn and cast. I really am disappointed that the series had to end. The scenery in Canada was great as well. The venue makes it easy to have plot twists different from the typical US locations. Great series!",1533427200,,416,4.712328767123288
8742949,5,B018THQ16C,"I recently found this series just by chance, sorry to have not known about it prior to this date,,but I am in love, comedy! Love! Action
Cast is great whomever is the casting director should be congratulated! This is a wonderful warm, loving! Supportive family even though it is not perfect! Very much like mine! Love Jake,Leslie, Rose! Malay! Des!
Aside! Too many to name
Even the so called villains,,,whoop whoop to Kevin Crocker and  the biker Charlie
Hopefully amazon, Hulu, etc will pick up Caught series",1533254400,,509,4.850574712643678
8742950,5,B018THQ16C,Ive known absolutely nothing about Newfoundland. Enchanting quirky characters. Ill bet theres lots of fun going on in the writers room.,1532649600,,135,5.476190476190476
8742951,5,B018THQ16C,"This series is about about a Canadian and his family. It is one of the many great shows that Canada produces. The mysteries are very interesting, including the situations that Jake Doyle can get into.",1530748800,,200,4.742857142857143
8742952,5,B018THQ16C,"Great show - really a gem.  Excellent stories, wonderful acting and a reflection of what good entertainment has to offer a society.",1524355200,,131,4.954545454545454
8742953,1,B018THQ16C,"Bad acting, juvenile dialogue",1523491200,,29,6.5
8742954,4,B018THQ16C,"I just LOVE Canada!  Lived there for a while (in Qc).  This series is quintessentially Canadian, replete with Newfoundland jokes and riffs on other provinces.  The basic premise is superficial in almost every episode, but the fun & wit are non-stop.  And the actors are telegenic.  Subtitles are ridiculously poor; not even basic English, much less high school Canadian, so ignore them and eliminate confusion.",1522800000,,410,5.246153846153846
8742955,5,B018THQ16C,"Saw Allan Hawco on an episode of Murdoch Mysteries and that lead me to this series. Hawco not only stars but was the creator/writer. Fun elements with a definite homage to the private eye shows of the 70s/80s; Jim Garner in Rockford Files most obviously. Good cast; balances quirky humor and serious drama and all set against the beautiful landscape of St. Johns, New Foundland.",1522800000,,378,4.8307692307692305
8742956,4,B018THQ16C,First series was fun.,1522713600,,21,4.5
