1958672,5,B0000Y8IWS,"As a no-holds-barred, mixed martial arts wannabe fighter I didn't know what to expext from Bas Rutten when it came to self-defense. I thought it would be the same UFC type techniques I have seen Bas use in NHB fights just taken outside to the street. Man, was I wrong. Bas explains the difference between a fight with rules and the no rules world of street fighting. The street calls for pure savagery when your life is on the line and there are no judges around to stop the bout. You will get an eye opener as to what street fighting is all about from spraying tabasco in your attackers eyes to breaking his leg with one sharp turn of your body. Good stuff and great quality from Bas all the way. Bas is ""THE MAN""!",1076889600,21,715,4.264705882352941
1958673,5,B0000Y8IWS,This is a fantastic instructional DVD by Bas Rutten. Rutten will show you every move to escape really ugly attacks your sure to face on the street in this violent insane world. The Production Quality is superb and the DVD I recived from Amazon was in a fullcolor package with a great shot of World Champion Rutten in action. I highly recommend this instructional to everyone interested in reality based combat. Well worth the money!!,1076889600,5,433,4.786666666666667
1958674,1,B0000Y8IWS,"When I received this dvd it was not even shrink wraped. The dvd itself was a copy not an original, with a paper stick on label. When I tried to play the dvd it did not work. I was very diapointed and returned this rip-off, but lost my ten dollar express shiping charge. This dvd is a two dollar product being sold for $49.95.

1958675,5,B0000Y8IWS,"I am a Big fan of Bas Rutten's and this is a great DVD that arrived in very professional color packaging. Rutten's ""Lethal Street Fighting"" opened my eyes to the dynamics of what really goes on in a street fight and the techniques needed to survive. Bas Rutten is very credible and dosen't waste your time with unrealistic fancy techniques that would get you killed in a real fight. What Rutten teaches is not for the faint at heart, his hardcore style of fighting is take no prisoners and do whatever it takes to survive. Bas covers every dangerous type of street confrontation along with the self-defense techniques he favors to counter the attack. He is also fond of using things like bottles and chairs to protect yourself against deadly knife weilding attackers. Since I lack ground fighting skills I especially liked his techniques for taking an attacker down and controlling him on the ground. With just one viewing I already feel much more confident as to what to expect in a street fight and how to handle it. This DVD offers valuable information you won't get anywhere else but from a great fighter like Bas Rutten. Like Rutten's ground breaking ""Big Books Of Combat"" which I own this DVD is excellent and well worth the money.",1071100800,5,1237,4.7050691244239635
1958676,5,B0000Y8IWS,Ive been a martial artist for about thirteen yrs and a bouncer for several yrs i bought this dvd just recently and i gota say ive actually used most of these techniques before so as far as efficiency goes these moves will work on the street i only weight 170 pounds so usually people think they can take me out fast which to their surprise ive used most of these techniches before so they end up getting hurt i did learn a few more pointers from this dvd however if you are not a person that is willing to hurt someone don't get this dvd because if you are not mentally ready then you will get hurt however if your ready to defend your self or your family then don't waste anymore time get this dvd now it might just save your life someday,1341100800,4,739,4.138888888888889
1958677,5,B0000Y8IWS,"When I saw some 1 star ratings, I was wondering why?? Then I saw it was because shipments were late or whatever. I don't see how anyone could complain about the content.

When I watch the video, it makes me think of what Bas might tell you if he has no choice but fight his way through a bar with you or he'll die. It seems like he really wants to help you.

The content is pretty good and the video is just all around entertaining. I remember ordering the Hostile Control Systems VHS tapes a million years ago from the back of some Ninja magazine. Those tapes were good, but no where near as entertaining as Bas showing you how to face smash someone with a chair.

Bas even covers good techniques for defending yourself against knives, guns, wrestling takedowns. He even discusses the adrenaline advantage attackers have and how you must be able to quickly increase yours to defend yourself.

I'm actually surprised someone hasn't hurt themselves and sued Bas by now. The dvd is not a toy and the information is serious and lethal. I learned a couple of things that might help defend myself against two or more people at some point in my life. That's well worth the cost of this dvd.

I would recommend it. Bas is funny, laid back, and very open in discussing the information. When I say he is laid back, don't mistake that for being unprepared. He demonstrates every angle of every move and he has stunt attackers who take his moves. He even brings in larger men to show what to do when bigger guys attack you.",1321056000,6,1512,4.424460431654676

1958680,5,B0000Y8IWS,"I've already been trained in Krav Maga, and picked this up really for my wife to watch, and as a review. I'm very familar with Bas Rutten, I like his humor and approach. It was very entertaining, contained good and valid information, and will teach you some techniques that are vry effective. The only lacking I feel comes fromt his video is it doesn't express the importance of training for the techniques to be effective. That really isn't the point of the video, so I can't penalize the movie for that. But it will show you good information in a humorous and effective way.",1252368000,,576,4.548076923076923
1958681,4,B0000Y8IWS,"Even when many reviews say is a self defense dvd for superman, the way I see it the dvd its actually quite good. If you consider all the information included for a single dvd is like a crash course on self defense. Theres many dvds in which you have to buy the whole ""collection"" of instructionals to get a grasp of everything you see in here. Plus many include dum techniques just to fill on more dvds to charge you more. Although I do agree that few of the techniques are hard to perform on bigger guys in general its still one of the best self defense dvds out there. I also agree its expensive but whatever..good stuff usually is. Another dvds on self defense I also recommend are the ""gracies street self defense"" eventhough is old, the ""street fighting self defense techniques"" from froes and koulikov and the ""hand to hand combat"" from the marine corps. Theres also some Krav Maga's dvds that are ok.
Hope that helps!",1250467200,,924,4.4733727810650885
1958682,3,B0000Y8IWS,"Bas Rutten's LSFSDS is not what I'd call a fighting system.  It's more like a collection of techniques and ideologies.  So if you are currently studying another fighting style or martial art you could integrate as much of this material as you thought appropriate into your ""Tool Box"". It may also help you in defining the difference between sport fighting and/or demo arts AND street fighting.  If you've never studied a fighting style this could be a good thing to get your head in the right place about fighting and what it takes to win a street fight.  But regardless you need to train with the techniques and study the ideas so that you can use them when/if the time comes.
Not to mention that there is a certain entertainment value to Bas' humor.  Production quality is not the best and packaging is sophomoric (just so you know)  But all in all its was a good purchase for me.",1250467200,2,882,4.515723270440252
1958683,3,B0000Y8IWS,"Thanks to this DVD I started Krav Maga. The video is well directed and the techniques are well executed. BR gives you some great tips on what to pay attention to when in a violent confrontation.

After years of Krav Maga, i now find this DVD a bit dangerous. Some of the things it shows could get you hurt :)

On the other hand some details are very difficult to be taught from a DVD.
Nevertheless it is is a good try, but not a ""Lethal Street Fighting"" self defense system!",1240531200,,474,4.197802197802198

1958687,5,B0000Y8IWS,"If you buy one self defense instructional dvd in your lifetime, buy this one. Bas Rutten is his always entertaining and informing self, explaining how to get away from a streetfight, how to defend yourself and how to end it. Bas goes over using near objects for weapons, using your surroundings, posture, and ofcourse a load of techniques for unarmed, armed and multiple attacker defense with as many variations as you can think of.

  What makes this better is that you do not have to be an MMA fan to like this. This is a great learning tool but Bas is so hilarious in how he explains things that its like a 90 minute comedy (yes, this instructional is 90 minutes! Now thats value!). If you have never done martial arts before you can still use this dvd, Bas will show you everything you need to know. I would recomend supplementing this with his big books of combat and other products because Bas gives you everything you need to not just survive but he gives you the tools to think on your feet for any situation (with enough practice ofcourse). A great DVD from Bas, don't waste your time looking for any other self defense DVDs, get this one today!",1170892800,2,1154,4.485714285714286

1958689,5,B0000Y8IWS,"I've had this DVD for a while.  I've watched it several times.  It's very entertaining.  Bas will show you some of the ins and outs of some non-traditional, mixed with real fighting tactics.

Some of the other reviewers are complaining that you have to be superman to use any of these maneuvers.  Bas is only 6'1, 205 lbs.  You have to have some confidence in yourself.  If you can't fight someone, you may need to escape.  What if you can't get away, or are outnumbered.  This DVD will help you rethink what you could do in particular situations.  I also recommend Bas Ruttens Mixed Martial Arts Workout DVD.",1157760000,3,609,4.555555555555555
1958690,3,B0000Y8IWS,"While Rutten is obviously a great fighter, that doesn't necessarily make him a great self-defense instructor. Many of these moves just are ""street ready"" and would fail the average size, average skilled man or woman in a confrontation. That, combined with the high price  and poor production values here make this a second string choice for a martial arts DVD library. I have a huge collection of street defense type DVDs and if I had to recommend one or two this wouldn't be at the to of my list. If you want something that's packed with techinques that will work in a pinch, especially for those of us who aren't built like UFC champs or linebackers, check out Sang Kim's Junsado Fundamentals DVD.",1149033600,10,699,4.682926829268292
1958691,2,B0000Y8IWS,"Bas Ruttens lethal streetfighting DVD covers various situations that could occur in real-life confrontations. In this DVD Rutten shows the techniques that he thinks are the best for different situations. Here comes the biggest problem of this film, the techniques that Rutten shows may work great with Rutten, but poorly on normal people. Most of the techniques shown on this DVD demand a lot of power from the people performing them. And as you know, a typical MMA-fighter isn't a portrait of an average man. Therefore, this DVD doesn't work very well for most of the people.

The most positive thing about this DVD is that it allways underlines the fact that its about street situations. Rutten seems to know a lot about real-life fights, and makes very good points that many people haven't even thought before.

Bas Rutten also tells a lot of good things about the use of improvised weapons, a part of the DVD, that I would have hoped to be a little longer and more thorough.",1147910400,4,978,4.747058823529412
1958692,2,B0000Y8IWS,"I don't really recommend this dvd because of the high price, because I think most of the moves are really pointless, especially the submission moves, you really don't want to do submission moves in a real street fight. Also like a previous reviewer said, some of the moves are too complex and a petite female wouldn't be able to do them to someone bigger. Plus, it's almost impossible to be holding your opponent's arm, especially if you have small hands, I've been in numerous street fights and spars and I've actually beaten guys bigger and stronger than myself, I've tested some of the moves on one of my sparring partners, especially on the bigger and stronger ones, they ended up not working because my opponent will not stand still for me to do the move especially if you have small hands like me. Despite the horrible grappling moves, the striking moves are good and his phylosophy of fighting is true too. As far as the striking moves go, I do not believe most people do the haymaker like he says in the video, I rarely encounter it, plus if the opponent does a barrage of punches on you, you can not counter it by moving back, and punching because in real fights they will come at you fast with a barrage of punches. His teachings of hitting the weak parts are good though and so are his teachings of stances. I don't want to give away too much of this dvd. Bas does a good job teaching though, I like his way of teaching he does it really slow with a lot of repeats. In conclusion if I were you, I would rather buy Russian Systema Fighting DVDS they are much more realistic, infact they even teach you how to take a nasty punch to the head, and also they teach with real punches to the face unlike Bas's with the air punching, it's very realistic, get that instead.",1125273600,16,1775,4.398176291793313
1958693,5,B0000Y8IWS,"If you have a weak stomach then this tape is not for you. If you want to learn how violent streetfighting is and what it takes to win against the scum who want to smash your head in then this is definetly for you. Bas Rutten does a nice job of teaching his system for dealing with many types of violent street situations and opens your eyes to reality combat. His techniques when applied will save your ass that's for sure. The lessons are well taught and DVD quality is very good, its a fasinating film by a very charismatic instructor.",1110067200,5,537,4.326732673267327
1958694,3,B0000Y8IWS,"The instructor in this film is Bas Rutten, former bouncer and UFC champion. This background is evident in this film, as some of the techniques presented are somewhat exotic, and not your average street realistic self defence for every man and woman -type stuff.

The film is divided in two halfs. The first half is filmed in a bar, and the techniques concentrate on standing techniques. The latter half is filmed in a boxing ring, and the techniques cover floor techniques. The film opens up with presentation of various objects found in a restaurant you can use as improvised weapon. Next, Rutten presents a correct ready posture and handles ranges of combat. After that, the film moves on to actual self defence techniques.

Most (but not all) of the techniques are quite simple, but many of them are not very universally applicable, or even very safe to perform. First of all, many of the techniques require that you lift your attacker off the floor. That might suit well for a big and strong man, but I don't see how a petite woman would pull this off to a man three times her weight. OK, it can be done, but is it reasonable to practice these kind of techniques, when you could use a different kind of technique that doesn't require as much strength. Secondly, some of the techniques can be used only in a very specific situations, and are not usable in different situations. Third, some of the techniques are risky to perform, like haymaker block, that makes you to walk straight into your opponent's fist if you use it to block a straight punch. Or a knife defence that requires you to kick your opponent's knife hand, making it very easy for your opponent to make you impale your leg into his knife. Fourth, these techniques do not present a real self defence system, rather they are a collection of separate techniques.

The best thing in this film are not the actual techniques, but principles and attitude. While the techniques are not very realistic for average man or woman with average skills, the attitude is towards surviving a street attack, rather that practicing for a competition of for overall fitness. For one thing, Rutten constantly reminds that the attacker may have friends, and some techniques are designed to take care of those extra attackers. He also advises you to look for objects you can use as weapons, if the need arises. And the overall attitude of the film is toward defending against real attack; you never forget that Rutten is speaking of real life situations instead of some techniques you can practice in dojo as a hobby.

There is quite lot of humour throughout the film, and Rutten also tells true stories where he has used these techniques (or they have been used against him); either in the octagon of in the street. I like Rutten's attitude that he does not try to convince the viewer that he knows it all, and that his way is not the only one there is. For example, he freely admits that he teaches some techniques that are pure krav maga techniques, and that for a better instruction on these techniques, you should seek a qualified krav maga instructor.

I think that this film does not present a very good self defence system. Rather, Rutten presents some interesting techniques, and handles some important principles of real life self defence. Therefore, this film serves best as an addition to your existing self defence techniques.

1958695,5,B0000Y8IWS,"This training video is definitely worth buying because it is very valuable in multiple ways. Here is a list of the reasons why (in my opinion)........

#1 - It incorporates itself into your current fighting style no matter what type of martial arts training you are into. Some videos out there are biased and only teach you things of it's style/ryu. NOT this video, it is a mixture of MANY types of fighting. It uses ""what works"" and the more realistic streetwise self-defense.

#2 - This wasn't made by a man who just got a blackbelt in a martial arts style and now is trying to toss together a low grade video to make some money, this was made by BAS RUTTEN! He PROVES he knows how to fight and WIN and tons of his wins are recorded by UFC and Pride fighting and other resources. Do yourself a favor and train with Bas Rutten because he is a WINNER.

#3 - Not only are you getting training in hand to hand combat, you are also learning how to deal with knives and guns in this video. You are learning how to deal with multiple attackers as well. Bas Rutten is serious about self defense and is a great teacher. There are a few humorous parts in it too. I found myself laughing out loud a few times when I first watched this video.

I am not affiliated with Bas Rutten or any agencies, i'm just a long time martial artist and I got sick of training in martial arts that weren't street-smart. I have been in Kung Fu and Ju Jitsu and a few other systems but I like Bas Rutten's videos alot more because he is realistic, quick, and to the point when dealing with attackers and thats what you need to WIN.",1095552000,13,1602,4.242622950819672

I bought it for my 13-yr old son, who is having problems with bullies at school. It's a bit too hard-core for that situation (I can envision him head-butting bullies if it's a serious situation, but slashing them with a broken bottle? ha ha...nope).

8004312,4,B0000Y8IWS,"Bas Rutten is one of the great modern characters. He is always entertaining. The video is like a specialist class in how to fight dirty in a bar. It talks about self-defense, but whats being taught has broader application. Some of what he says is universal and applies to everyone. But some of it is not. Certain of the techniques require that you have to be about the same size as the opponent.

The first half is set in a bar. He goes over various defense techniques in the standing position. One thing that was particularly useful is how he goes over the different techniques to use a different distances. The points he makes about always been on guard when someone gets in your face are particularly good. Many of the combination moves, various throws and so on are only situationally useful and he never talks about that. Whats really missing is he needed to go through how to fight with people and smaller than the person is.

He also talks about objects in a bar that can be used as weapons, how to counter them and how to create your own weapons. Even when its obvious (use a chair to block a knife), his personality still makes the presentation fun.

The second part of the DVD is set in the ring. He demonstrates way too many techniques that require lifts, throws and other moves which assume lots of upper body strength. Some of it makes sense. Other things make less sense. Some of the moves are based on dangerous assumptions about what the other person might be doing. If you guess right, you will do serious damage, but if you guess wrong you would really pay for it. The particular example I can think of is exposing a leg to a knife.

While the moves are sometimes questionable, the general advice he gives is absolutely correct. Examples: Always watch whats in the hands, never go to the ground because the opponent may have friends, always be on guard if someone gets directly in your face. Most of what he says also comes across as highly authentic given that he was both a bouncer and a serious bar fighter. This is not some teacher. Rather its a guy who lived it. While there are lots of pluses to having ""lived it"", its not really a defense system with lots of thought put into it. Its simple situational moves.

I would watch it because its entertaining and there are some useful things said about these sorts of fights. But don't expect a training or self-defense system. Enjoy it for what it is.",1412899200,,2421,4.480725623582766

8004316,5,B0000Y8IWS,"I was looking for some self defense training CD's to expand my fighting repertoire.  Prior to finding out about this CD, I was taken by an internet huckster for about $200...I quickly found out it was a pile of internet-researched junk no self respecting self defense expert would ever teach people!

That being said, why recommend Bas Rutten's Lethal Street Fighting?  Several things come to mind.

1.  Bas Rutten is a former King of Pancrase, former UFC Heavyweight Champion, and a former bar bouncer...so not only does he know how to fight, he's fought in a ring and 'on the street' so you know his techniques are battle tested.

2.  Bas Rutten explains every move in simple detail, and shows you each move from different angles, so almost anyone can learn this with a little practice.  After watching these videos, it's clear he not only can fight, he can teach fighting, which is very very rare.

3.  At $24.95, the value delivered has no peer in self defense.  Not only can it save your life, but you will save money too.

4.  Like the title implies, the moves in the CD are actually lethal when applied correctly.  You will not only learn how to break arms and legs, you can render people unconscious, blind, or several other unpleasant outcomes.  I cannot emphasize it enough, use for self defense only!

All in all, if you were to get one video self defense traning course, I cannot recommend anything better...unless you can get Bas Rutten to train you in person.",1377561600,,1473,4.651162790697675

With this dvd it says ""Lethal"" in the title and with a lot of the things he shows are very lethal. As his says quite a few times, this is a street fight and there are no rules. Bas, does go through knowing your surroundings and understanding things that could help you, and what you need to look for, if you need to defend yourself in a wide range of scenarios. However, I think one major point that get's glossed over is the fact that legally you can only carry a fight to the point where you can escape. If you continue past that point you could be criminally prosecuted.",1354838400,,657,4.181102362204724
