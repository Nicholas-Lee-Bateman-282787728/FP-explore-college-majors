3443126,2,B0019PL2QQ,"The Wedding Date is bad. The characters are unrealistic and not likeable from the start. Immediately made me disinterested.
The Story of Us is just a bitter slugfest with no real substance.
Intolerable Cruelty has some moments, and I didn't see the other one yet. But if only half of the movies are decent, it's not much of a deal for the money.",1309651200,,345,4.492063492063492

8274963,4,B0019PL2QQ,"This 4 pack of dvds, is a very good value. We got many hours of enjoyable entertainment, from these cute movies. Some, of course, we liked better than others, but I'd give this a thumbs up, as 4 packs go. My husband doesn't mind chick flicks, as long as they have a good story, so this was perfect for us.",1348790400,,305,4.1
8274964,5,B0019PL2QQ,"The movies aren't the greatest (with the exception of the Coen Brother's ""Intolerable Cruelty""), but if you're watching a romantic comedy expecting to give it a Palme d'Or, you're weird.  It's a great value for four adequate movies.",1347321600,,232,5.105263157894737
