8530576,4,B008UQUS3U,"The title of this excellent documentary series released by Athena, a subsidiary of Acorn Media, specialists in quality programming, is somewhat misleading. The problem with using narrow escapes in the title is that it implies POWs and escapes from concentration camps. The series is so much more than that. Coupled with the informative learning guide that comes with this four DVD set, the viewer or student will come away enriched and even fascinated by some of the powerful stories recounted here. Athena presents many documentaries and has a particular focus on educational material. This is arguably one of their best.

As a person reasonably well-educated on matters pertaining to World War II, I was delighted to discover a number of stories Id never heard before in this at times riveting, always interesting series chronicling close calls (A better description than narrow escapes) in World War II.

And lest one assume that all the stories focus on Allied protagonists, there is a very broad range of situations covered here, with a few Axis escapes thrown in the mix. There was a time when this might not sit well with a U.S./British/Canadian audience, but enough time has passed since the Second World War that people can be a little more objective about such things. Each episode is compelling and utilizes archival footage extremely well. In fact, the actual war-time footage is so good it makes the re-enactments look mostly weak by comparison.

On the other hand some of the interviews that the producers have secured are fascinating. One episode, number 11,  called Moores March includes an interview with one of the four survivors of one of the most incredible close calls youll ever hear about, a 300 mile trek across the desert with no food and almost no waterand barefoot. The ordeal left the interviewee severely traumatized and while time has helped heal his stress, there are still hints of it on hand. Another excellent episode, number 3, Wingate & The Chindits includes a number of survivors interviews. This event, set in the Burmese jungle against the Japanese, movingly recounts the strong bond between the desperate men and their donkeys, who served them so well and had to be slaughtered for food towards the end of the campaign. One interviewee reads a poem about one donkeys last moments and provides a fitting reminder of how animals serve and sacrifice for humans during times of war. I wouldnt go so far as to call this War Donkey, and Im sure Spielberg will never make a film about it, but it is very moving nonetheless.

A number of recent historical documentaries have tried to jazz things up by using shaky camera work and rapid cutting techniques. Fortunately, NARROW ESCAPES OF WORLD WAR II is of a more traditional style and eschews this sometimes annoying approach. It recognizes that a strong story is the focal point of any documentary and the visuals are there simply to back up and illuminate, not distract.

This series will be of considerable interest to military history buffs, but educators should also take note. This is an excellent resource for helping to teach young people about the pivotal historical event of the 20th-Century.

NARROW ESCAPES OF WORLD WAR II is a worthwhile investment of both time and money.",1397433600,2,3267,4.950729927007299
8530577,5,B008UQUS3U,"Narrow Escapes of World War II is a very absorbing series highlighting and chronicling some of the untold exploits, heroics, sacrifices and horrors of WWII. This show plays down the heroics and focuses on the danger and challenges faced in various operations and happenings during the war. It is rather matter of fact and that is what I like about it. I also like the details revealed and the way it holds no punches on the outcome of many who endured the rigors of duty.",1377561600,2,471,4.552941176470588

8530580,5,B008UQUS3U,"The comments describing this series in Amazon all true..

I have been collecting WW2 war CDs and books for over 60 years. This is a great series from the BBC. I saw stuff that I've never seen before! Well done and the concept of ""narrow escapes"" is brilliant.

If you are interested in WW2 CDs, this is a MUST. Doubt me at your own peril! It's fantastic.",1362355200,,354,4.268656716417911
8530581,4,B008UQUS3U,"Too much British narration, too Bristish escapes, if you buy this DVD try to the American narration. The best escapes involved any country but the British.",1359676800,,155,5.0
8530582,5,B008UQUS3U,"Do not watch this series if you become depressed easily. It gives the unvarnished truth about many famous operations. This includes the cost in lives and equipment for the allied military people and the civilians near the operation. For many operations, it questions the wisdom and leadership of the upper management of the military and the wisdom and leadership at the operational level that caused some of the operations to have no real benefit for the allied cause in the war or killed a large fraction of the people involved.

Since I am a former Army Captain and war veteran who was responsible for the troops under my command, I was so affected by the revelations in this series that I could only view part of the series in three minute increments. I even shed some tears for the people affected by the poor decisions.",1355097600,6,824,4.682758620689655
8530583,5,B008UQUS3U,"WWII narrow escapes that are seldom mentioned. After a Military Channel airing, available on DVD. Exciting and well done bits of WW2 battles, most of which had great influence on the war's outcome, yet hardly mentioned in history books. The bulk of the footage is B&W being archived original battlefront film. Occasional reenactment segments are easily distinguished due to color. Commentary comes from war experts, historians, and several vet survivors of the events presented. Quite an amazing series to add to any WWII DVD collection &/or war historian's chest.
Not a cozy travelogue, but real battle with some disturbing graphic scenes. Some of the interviewed vets have difficulty sharing their memories.

Hero stuff.
