8732672,5,B015508FEM,"I love John Wayne, so getting to see him in his old movies for me is fun. I especially love him in True Grit and The Shootist! The DVDS are in great condition no problem with that. I just not sure i liked having all the DVDS stacked on top of each other. But i have now a special case for my DVDS so not an issue. Now i need to get his other movie ""The Quiet Man!""",1534809600,,364,3.6794871794871793
