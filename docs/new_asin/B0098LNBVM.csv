8537600,5,B0098LNBVM,"Wu Man has probably done more to bring the Chinese pipa to the attention of Western audiences and composers than any other artist. As a performer, she had always had a terrific cross-cultural sensibility and now she brings us a fascinating documentary about vanishing musical traditions in rural China. This is not just a film for musicologists and anthropologists. It is an introduction to a way of life that is completely foreign to most of us but the story is universal. Anyone who believes that we need to get to know our neighbors around the world will want to watch this film.",1350000000,2,582,4.715686274509804
8537601,5,B0098LNBVM,"This is a fascinating documentary about musical traditions that most people would never know about. It is beautifully filmed, with an abundance of rich conversations and musical examples performed in some of China's most remote, rural settings. The documentary allows us to follow the intrepid pipa virtuosa, Wu Man, as she travels great distances and gains the confidence of artists to document the captivating musical treasures that are passed on orally from generation to generation. Both entertaining and educational, this DVD has wide appeal to musicians and non-musicians alike. Wu Man's monumental achievement in sharing this art with the world is inspiring.",1349568000,,665,5.529411764705882
