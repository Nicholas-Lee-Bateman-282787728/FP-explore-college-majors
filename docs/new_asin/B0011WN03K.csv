3070427,5,B0011WN03K,"Wonderful movie, a great cast particularly Mary Astor and Raymond Massey. The actual hurricane is impressive today considering this movie was made in 30s. It holds up wonderfully. A classic must have. John Ford spent $150, 000 on the sets and $250, 000 to destroy it. The film utilized huge vats of water and airplane engines to achieve hurricane effects. Astor ststed filming with all that wind/water was a bitch. This is a Korean import and the transfer is quite good. It is easy to turn off the Korean subtitles. Excellent all-around. The US release is out of print. This issue is a nice to edition to my video library.",1396396800,,622,4.663636363636364
3070428,4,B0011WN03K,"When this movie starts, all I could really think about was how pretty Dorothy Lamour was, how modern-looking Jon Hall was, and how charmingly unconvincing they were as Polynesians, each remembering their ""accents"" only about half the time.

However, once the story gets going, it does pull you in, and the film is never boring, with the plot twisting in unexpected ways so that, by the end, the film has encompassed many genres--action, drama, suspense, melodrama, and finally, disaster flick. I wasn't expecting much from the special effects, considering this was made in 1937 but boy, when that hurricane hits, you'll be surprised how real it looks and how suspensefully the sequence is managed.

In some ways, it was MORE exciting than a modern day disaster flick because you know everything you're seeing was really there. They didn't have many tricks back then. If a person is seen getting hit by a wall of water moving 60 MPH, chances are, they  really were!  I actually got uncomfortable watching it becuase it seemed at so many points as if the actors lives (or at least well-being) must have been endangered getting some of the shots.

But the film makers have done just enough character development for us to care what happens to Dorothy, Jon and the other inhabitants of the island. Raymond Massey somewhat overplays the villain of the piece, while Mary Astor does the best she can with an illogical character that is too compassionate and smart to be with such a guy.

Like I said, it's got  a little of everything. I don't know if I'd want to watch it again and again, but I'm glad i saw it and I think if you like old movies, it should be in your film-history vernacular.",1395273600,,1685,4.691525423728813

The 2 principals don't have too much to do except look gorgeous and get our sympathy, which they do extremely well. John Ford's direction is taut and doesn't waste a frame as usual - I reckon Peter Jackson would have taken another 3 hours to tell this tale and bored the audience rigid.
The supporting cast is superb, C.Aubrey Smith, Mary Astor, Thomas Mitchell, Raymond Massey all doing what they do best. There is a very engaging innocence about this film which is sadly absent from movies these days - where did it go I wonder ?
So if you love old b/w movies, dislike a CG effect overload, you couldn't do better than giving this a try. I remember seeing it one Sunday afternoon on TV when I was a young boy and I was pleased to see my fond memories weren't mistaken.",1438732800,,893,4.5875

8242873,5,B0011WN03K,"It's hard to believe that when this film was released in 1937, some of director John Ford's best loved films...'The Quiet Man', 'Grapes of Wrath' and 'Stagecoach'...had yet to be made. Ford's career actually started in the Silent Era. This film highlights some of the cinema genius that would become synonymous with John Ford.

The story centers around Manukura native islanders Marama (Dorothy Lamour, who looks amazing, even in black and white), and new husband Terangi (played by Jon Hall). Terangi soon returns to sea, and in a brawl in Tahiti, breaks a man's jaw. As Terangi is a native, and his victim a white, he receives a harsh jail sentence. Not prepared for the slow torture of captivity, he repeatedly tries to escape, which only adds to his sentence. His last attempt is successful, with the kindly priest of Manukura (played by C. Aubrey Smith) finding Terangi adrift and hiding him while he recovers. By this time, the hurricane is knocking at the door. Terangi must decide between escaping with his beloved Marama (who now has a child), or returning to help his fellow islanders. 'The Hurricane' is at once a tale of romance and a story of redemption. Slow to start, but builds to a terrific finale as the storm sweeps in.

Notable roles included Raymond Massey as DeLaage, the stern, by-the-book governor of Manukura, a French colonial island. With his intense eyes and distinctive baritone voice, Massey had a commanding presence whenever he was on screen. Thomas Mitchell is best remembered today for playing the absent-minded Uncle Billy in 'It's a Wonderful Life', but this role has Mitchell playing the boozing doctor, with a kind heart, who refuses to leave a very pregnant islander in the hurricane. Thomas Mitchell is one of only a few Hollywood celebrities to land the 'trifecta'...not only an Oscar, but also an Emmy (television) and a Tony (Broadway). His first Oscar nomination in fact, was for his role in this film. He was nominated again (and won) just 2 years later for 'Stagecoach'. A young John Carradine, who had an almost supernatural ability to play either sympathetic or evil characters, has a nasty turn here as Terangi's sadistic jailer. And C. Aubrey Smith as the priest. What a career this guy had...predating even Ford's career, Smith actually started acting on stage...in 1895! Rounding out the cast is Mary Astor as the wife of De Laage. And the only thing he loves more than law and order is his wife.

The effects are quite amazing. Many younger viewers will not be impressed, but this was 'old school' Hollywood at its best. There was no CGI. What you see is what you get. The hurricane was pulled off with tons of water and airplane engines providing the wind. The last 20 to 30 minutes of the film IS the hurricane, which effectively becomes the star. You feel as though you've been through a storm after it's over.

All in all, this was film done on the cusp of Hollywood's golden era, and it shows. This version is also more true to the original story, written by James Norman Hall, Jon Hall's uncle. Hmmm....gotta wonder if somebody pulled some strings to get him the role of Terangi. Dino De Larentiis bankrolled a late 70's remake which starred Jason Robards, Mia Farrow and a former Hawaiian surfer, Dayton Ka'ne. It doesn't take long to figure out why the 1979 version costs LESS than the '37 classic. After reading one too many reviews on this film, in which a number of reviewers (many of them male) swooned poetically about the ""the sizzling Dayton"" and ""those honey-colored eyes""...Ugh! It was clear many of them were more smitten with the pretty boy than the actual movie. As noted New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted, ""Mr. Ka'ne doesn't act, but he does look like John Travolta, beefed up on a bodybuilding course."" In addition, Mia Farrow was already in her 40's, had the emotional range of a rock and horribly miscast. That about sums it up for the remake. For me, the original film is the ONLY one worth considering.

Transfer quality is quite good. Overall picture is very sharp, but with some notable 'grainy' texture that seems to be inherent with older B/W films transferred to DVD. Sound is excellent. The disc will start in default mode, with the Korean subtitles, but this is easily fixed by switching the subtitles to 'off'.",1429142400,,4305,4.780913978494624
