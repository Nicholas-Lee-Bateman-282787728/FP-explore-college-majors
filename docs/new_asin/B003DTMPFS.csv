4112065,4,B003DTMPFS,"I had heard about this documentary being developed for a couple of years and I'm glad it finally was released in DVD.......this is a must buy for any serious baseball film buff or historian.

Without question, Tiant is the stuff baseball legends are made of, it is lesson in American/Cuban relations for the younger generation, but mostly it is the epic emotional journey of Luis Tiant's return visit to Cuba after his baseball career was over.  Trying to reconnect with surviving family members and friends after decades of separation was heartwrenching.

The story within the story about how Fidel Castro grants Tiant's parents permission to go to the US to see their son play ball is fascinating.  The sacrifices endured by both Tiant and his parents so that he could live out his dream of playing baseball are incredible.",1294617600,3,825,4.913669064748201
4112066,5,B003DTMPFS,"A must see for all LATINO baseball fans...
And for those who want to understand what the gifted athletes from Cuba had to go through...

And about Mr Tiant's visit to Cuba? One can see and feel how he felt returning home...",1292630400,,223,4.309523809523809
4112067,5,B003DTMPFS,"This might be the best sports documentary I've ever seen. Incredibly moving and emotional. As the son of Cuban parents who fled the island and Castro's Marxist tyranny, it was especially cathartic for me and my family. Flawlessly produced and directed, to call this a must-see for baseball fans is to sell it short. You do not need to be a fan of Luis Tiant or baseball to be moved by this documentary.",1278806400,6,402,4.52054794520548
4112068,5,B003DTMPFS,"There are two very different elements incorporated into this documentary:  Louis Tiant's history, and a current day visit back to Cuba for his first time since he left during the revolution.  I probably shouldn't mention these distinct parts because they are interwoven so seamlessly in the documentary that they form one coherent whole.  They tell a tight story of a man who is separated from his family for most of his life, of two nations providing distinct opportunities, and of a son who emulates his father's pitching success in many ways but with completely different financial results.  Maybe you think you know the story, but you don't.  Trust me, there are surprises.  The end is so beautiful, it hurts.  How amazing is it to watch a director transcend both the sports documentary and biopic traps?  You might imagine that if you don't care about baseball or Cuba that this is not a film for you.  I believe if you care about people, you will like it.",1271980800,15,961,4.740963855421687

4112070,5,B003DTMPFS,"I was a young man and avid baseball fan during Luis Tiant's immortal pitching days. As a Cuban American he made me very proud of who I was. Now more than 40 years later, I happened to come across this film while browsing Amazon's video collection. Boy, what a trip to the past! I mean that both in baseball terms and human terms. I  also left Cuba in 1961 and didn't go back in over 40 years. I found this film to be both emotionally wrenching  and spiritually lifting.  You don't have to be a baseball fan or Cuban to be moved by this story. One of the best documentaries ever. I'm buying the DVD. This is a keeper!",1347062400,,616,4.159663865546219
4112071,5,B003DTMPFS,"As a Cuban-American who was born in the States but has parents that left Cuba at the same time, this film really hit home. We were lucky in that most of my parents' families were able to leave Cuba. I could not imagine what it must have been like for Luis to go back and to see so many family members after 46 years. But there are also some really great, funny scenes to balance the drama. My favorite has to be when they drop in on the ""hot corner"" to ask who was the greatest Cuban pitcher ever in the Bigs. Such a well crafted documentary. I hope that Luis has found peace.",1346198400,,576,4.06140350877193
4112072,5,B003DTMPFS,"I grew up a Yankee fan and was glad when Luis joined the team in 1979. I always mimicked Tiant's windup when we played whiffleball.

While this was moving in some parts, one thing was unintentionally amusing: When he returned to his dilapidated neighborhood, he said that ""everything has changed."" I found that fascinating since the pictures from 40 years earlier depict no change in the neighborhood. Also, people were still driving around in 1960's American cars. For all the college professors and Hollywood ""stars"" who gush about how wonderful socialism is--this film shows just how much socialism/communism sucks. The neighborhood hadn't changed because there is no progress in socialist societies as compared to capitalist societies. I'm sure that the high members of the communist party were living large while the proletariat were living in poverty.

Despite my little sidebar, it's still an interesting story.",1334361600,,918,5.324137931034483
4112073,4,B003DTMPFS,"I agree with the positive reviews of this documentary. It was moving and provided good persepctive on the mixed feelings of friends and family spearated for decades. I just wanted you all to know that you don't have to be a baseball fan to love this movie! This was filmed before the Obama administration eased the rules about travel to Cuba. Louis Tiant, retired from a prominent baseball career, longs to see his Cuban friends and family before he dies. He finds a way to get in to Cuba by traveling with an exhibition baseball team. In order to make it legal, even his camera crew, not regular baseball players, need to suit up and play. The movie shows Mr Tiant visiting an elderly expatriate before he leaves. She has been able to visit Cuba (there were ways for tourists to sneak in and out in the 90s and 00s) and tells him that he will see changes. When he arrives in Cuba, he is able to visit old friends and relatives. They are aware of his prominence in baseball, especially his time with the Red Sox. There are many closeups of the faces and emotions as friends and relatives recount their decades of separate lives. Mr. Tiant shows pictures and some old footage of his father who played in the US Negro leagues. His father returned because of the racism in the United States. When Mr. Tiant first left Cuba, the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred. Borders were closing, and Castro insisted that all baseball players outside of Cuba return immediately or never return. He made the hard decision to stay in the United States and pursue a professional baseball career. Mr. Tiant recounts the racism that he endured during the 60s and how racial attitudes changed over time. He clearly shows regret about the decades separated from his parents and cherishes a picture of his father in a baseball uniform.

This documentary was made before the new rules about visiting relatives in Cuba. One can see the advantages of the recent rules that make it easier for Cuban Americans to visit their relatives legally. Now more people will be able to visit their friends and family before they die.",1327708800,,2091,4.636118598382749
4112074,5,B003DTMPFS,"worth watching alone for the scene in Fenway when Tiant's father,himself a legendary negro league player, gets to throw out the first pitch. great moment. Great nostalgia. The whole movie is a great watch.",1326412800,,205,5.0588235294117645
4112075,5,B003DTMPFS,spectacular and very real and heartfelt. Not a boring second. Cannot believe this moving is not super popular. AAAAA++++++ Would like to own a copy/,1321488000,,148,4.96
4112076,5,B003DTMPFS,"Despite not being a baseball fan nor having an prior knowledge of Louis Tiant, I found this film riveting. It is the story of a 64 year old man who, after 40 + years, was allowed to return to his childhood home in Havana Cuba. Interwoven in the present day trip, is the story of his life and success as a major league pitcher. It retells the history of the Bay of Pigs Invasions and shows how the US relations with Cuba personally impacted individuals like Mr. Tiant -- forbidding him from returning to the country and separating him from his beloved family. The present day scenes from Havana were just heartbreaking, but don't let that turn you away from the film. It is also the success story of a man who overcame great obstacles to find fulfillment and happiness. I loved it.",1317600000,,780,4.461538461538462
4112077,5,B003DTMPFS,"Just  a great film, well done, great balance between past and present. Shows a beisbol champion and a human being..Great film. Do you know that Luis is not in the Hall of fame yet?? Ask my self why not...",1310169600,,204,4.230769230769231

8394928,5,B003DTMPFS,"Being a lifelong Red Sox fan and history buff, I bought 2 copies of this DVD, both autographed by ""el Tiante"" himself when it first came I originally saw it on ESPN. I gave one copy to a lovely women from Venezuela (the next Cuba) and kept one for myself.
This movie will grab your heart, squeeze it, and make you cry.",1411516800,,318,4.145161290322581

8394932,5,B003DTMPFS,I am an American born Cuban. I visited the island 8 times to meet my family for the first time starting in 1995. Imagine meeting your family for the first time at the age of 36. This video is a good representation of how 1 man was able to tear families apart for more than 50 years; even someone as famous as Luis Tiant. Incredibly well done...,1366156800,,344,4.149253731343284
8394933,4,B003DTMPFS,"It is hard not to feel for Louie considering he had to decide between a career and his family in Cuba at a pretty young age.  It was also a very insightful look at Cuba.  I really enjoyed the interviews with his former teammates, they really respeced Louie.",1363219200,,257,4.333333333333333
8394934,5,B003DTMPFS,"If you are a fan of Luis Tiant, or the Red Sox, or old time baseball and emergence of foreign player talent in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, there is no way you will not love this documentary of Luis Tiant's emotional return to Cuba after a 47-year exile.  Very well done and poignantly presented.  The emotion when he meets Tony Oliva's brother, people from his old neighborhood and his surviving relatives in their modest surroundings is very genuine.  Tiant has been a troubled soul since leaving Cuba in the 1960s and his life seems to have become a very empty existence leading up to his trip.",1362096000,,591,4.5046728971962615
8394935,5,B003DTMPFS,"This story weaves together the story of baseball and the struggles of a father and son against a backdrop of US/Cuban relations.  Tiant establishes himself as a great pitcher much like his father.  But, his father never made it to the Majors mainly because of the ""color line.""  Tiant returns to Cuba after 46 years and runs into old friends and visits elderly aunts and cousins.  This is a deeply personal story that will likely bring tears to your eyes.  The 1975 World Series, Carlton Fisk, Fidel Castro and Senator George McGovern all play a role in this story.  Refreshingly, Tiant is not portrayed as a hero nor as a victim but a great pitcher dealing with life's struggles and accidents.",1355356800,,694,4.694214876033058
