3823161,1,B001VPJYZK,"Season 5 is by far the weakest season. The stories are slow and  predictable and the diologue is sappy and we got the worst ""mystery"" yet. And the funny thing is that Marc Cherry is under the impression that he is doing a really good job??? I also hated the finale. The whole season was weak, so, I wasn't expecting a great cliffhanger, but it even disappointed my least expectations! Seriously, in my opinion, the only good part was Bree and Karl. I also hated the finale because of the weak ""mystery"", 24 episodes for nothing. What is Marc Cherry thinking? Dave's mystery was not one for 24 episodes. It would have been like taking McClusky's husbands in the freezer story and stretching it to 24. There were no big twists and turns. It was very predictable and slow. I actually enjoyed the Applewhite mystery alot more.

This season the writers clearly took the year off. It was obvious that the writers just didn't put that much effort into this season.  I guess they thought their great leap forward for 5 years would carry them forward more than it did. There weren't any storylines that were really compelling. Mike and Katherine never lit any sparks; it's like Katherine was Mike's mother. Actually they totally ruined Katherine's character. In season 4 she was strong and sarcastic, but now she is a nice but whiney woman. Tom is still acting like a child and arguing with Lynette, who was pretty boring this season. Susan's relationship with jackson went nowhere. And worst of all, they killed off Edie. Killing her off was a huge mistake. The show won't be the same without her. I'm hoping they bring in new characters next season. They also need to put more effort into the scripts and stop recycling old storylines. All in all, I'd say season 5 was pretty uneventful. The juice has obviously dried up.",1245542400,7,1814,4.6625
3823162,4,B001VPJYZK,"Desperate Housewives - The Complete Fifth Season saw the show jumping 5 years ahead, I think it was a good change but by the end of the season, the storylines started getting ridiculous. I liked how Gaby lost her sex appeal and Carlos got his sight back. I didn't care for the whole Mike and Katherine new couple situation, they have no chemistry! Felicity Huffman is my favorite actress on this show but I didn't like how her character became so boring. I was very upset when Creator Marc Cherry killed off Edie played brilliantly by Nicolette Sheridan. The best episode of the season is the last one Sheridan is in, she was a force to be wrecken with, and she proved she could act - the show doesn't feel the same without her. I didn't care for the finale, Lynette is pregnant with twins again, c'mon!! Hopefully Season 6 will be the best year yet. 4 stars for Season 5.",1245456000,3,872,4.422360248447205
3823163,1,B001VPJYZK,"In the wake of ""Reality TV,"" and the abundance of shows with that premise behind it's name, Desperate Housewives was the most refreshing program to hit television when it surfaced in 2004. When the fourth season concluded with having life on Wisteria Lane jump to five years, I thought the creativity was sincere and looked forward to the continued intrigue that lied ahead. But no such luck. Let me put it to you this way, the producers would have been so smart to have ended the series that way given what they offered in season five. Let me put it to you another way, I stopped watching the show regularly by November after the fire in the nightclub( you know, where Dave runs back into the burning building to save Mike and then runs back out free of harm and not even the most insightful characters have a clue as to his evil nature). Let me put it to you this way--nobody wanted to see Susan five years ahead still failing at romances, acting stupid within her self-assessment of romances while there's a younger man so smitten with her instead of someone his own age. Why not have Susan catch a clue about Dave and investigate him instead of the old lady and her sister(what a waste for poor Lily Tomlin)whom we never knew she had until now. In hearing about what took place at the season's end, are we really supposed to believe that Bree would consider Carl given her high moral standards and values against getting involved with an ex-husband of a close friend? And Mike and Katherine as a couple? Never bought it for a second. And the whole story with Lynette and her teenage son sleeping with his best friend's mother and then the drama that followed? Hated it. Let me put it to you another way--enough said!",1244764800,5,1720,4.516025641025641
3823164,5,B001VPJYZK,"This season was great!!!  A lot of twists and turns with all of the cast!!!  And a great build up to the season finale, which left me speechless!!! Although Edie was not a main part or the 4 main wives, I will miss her character..And with Bree, Gabby, Lynette, and Susan all getting more cunning and funnier, it makes a great season!!!! A definate must have for ANY DH fan!!!! cant wait to see what season 6 brings!!!!",1242777600,4,418,4.346153846153846
3823165,5,B001VPJYZK,"The five year jump at the end of Season 4 was an interesting way to wrap up the season.  I was worried that viewers would lose interest, but Marc Cherry pulled it off!  The storylines were great and we were introduced to the darkest mystery character that the show has ever had.  The final episode was filled with twists and turns and will have every fan on the edge of their seat if they haven't already seen it.  Kudos to Desperate Housewives!  Keep cranking it out!",1242604800,3,468,4.395348837209302
3823166,1,B001VPJYZK,This was the WORST season of Desparate Housewives. They completely massacred the characters. They're all just so different from the characters we've grown to love.,1242604800,6,163,5.56
3823167,5,B001VPJYZK,"I enjoyed Season 5 of ""Desperate Housewives"" very much. In a surprising twist, the fourth season of the series fast-forwarded five years at the end of the final episode. When Season 5 begins, Bree (Marcia Cross) is a successful author and owner of her own catering business, and recently welcomed her husband, Orson, back from prison. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) is financially strapped and is raising two young girls with her still-blind husband, Carlos. Lynette (Felicity Huffman) and her husband, Tom, are raising four troublesome children and struggling with their pizza parlor. Susan (Teri Hatcher) and Mike have divorced after a serious car accident destroyed their marriage, and Mike ends up shacking up with Katharine (Dana Delaney). Finally, Edie (Nicolette Sheridan) reappears on Wisteria Lane with a mysterious new husband in tow, who is hell-bent on a silent quest for revenge.

Overall, this is a great season full of fun. Highlights of the season include Gabrielle's effort to regain her model figure, Orson's little problem with kleptomania, and Bree's surprising new love interest in the final episode of the season, which I know most people will probably hate but I find absolutely hilarious. Dave's storyline is fantastic and drives the entire season...this was definitely one of the best mysteries on the show so far. As usual, the season finale ends with a cliffhanger. I won't spoil it for everyone, I'll just say, it better be Susan under there! I can't wait for Season 6.",1242604800,,1498,5.139344262295082
3823168,2,B001VPJYZK,"after an awesome 4th season and almost past midseason on the 5th season, its really sad to say this show should be put to rest for good,the storylines are absurd,no real funny moments,all the ladys are simply boring,even eva longoria who is by far the funniest. i really think they should end this series in the sixth season and bring back fan favorites like susan daughter and bree's daughter. i heard they wanna prolong this until 2013,and i don't even want to imagine what kinda show would that be by then,expecially after losing edie and a mistery thats so beyond stupid and predictable it hurts. anyway we'll see",1239235200,5,617,4.722222222222222
3823169,5,B001VPJYZK,"Prior to purchasing the first four seasons of Desperate Housewives I had never watched any of the episodes on TV.  By the commercials I had seen though I had a feeling it would be something I'd like.  Recently I've taken the time to watch all four seasons and I'm chomping at the bit now waiting for Season five.  I don't know how I'll make it all the way to September!!!

This show is different than most, at least to me.  I thought it was going to be more of a ""Soap Opera"" type but it's more of a drama with comic undertones.  It'll make you laugh mostly, make you cry sometimes and make you sit there with your mouth hanging open thinking ""I can't believe she did that!"".

I find this series thoroughly enjoyable and addictive!!",1238630400,26,732,4.338235294117647

3823259,4,B001VPJYZK,"The continuing depiction of the darker side of suburbia has this season skipping five years on from the end of the previous season. The character differentials of the first season - dipsy Susan, sensible Lynette, glamorous Gabriel, manipulative Eadie, and glacial Bree are pretty entrenched and the male support as strong as ever. The central darkness contribution in story narrative comes from the new husband of Eadie, the victim of a lost wife and child due to a car crash involving Mike and Susan. So there is still the old tried and trusted method of having at its heart a revenge story with murder as ultimate aim. This is put over well, although, as per usual far fetched, but high camp and enjoyable. What is different here are the cameos: Lily Tolim makes an appearance as the sister of Mrs. McClusky, Beau Bridges as a handyman and these additional characters lend weight and gravitas to the proceedings. The episodes that stand out are 13 - which is a real unexpected tear jerker with the neighbourhood women reminiscing the experiences of the kindness and wisdom given to them by the handyman. This is a very, very moving and clever episode which gives the viewer an insight into some of the more private emotionally demanding moments of their lives. Episode 19 is where we find Eadie's character and the responses to her viewed, again through the singular interactions between the neighborhood vamp and the rest of the women.  A strong season and well worth the buck.",1434844800,,1480,4.826771653543307

3823299,3,B001VPJYZK,"A disappointing season in my opinion. There is an episode about a handyman that is placed in the middle of the season that has no connection to the rest of the plot. The Dave Williams character is great and the acting is excellent but unfortunately the story is drawn out way too much to the point where you are almost relieved when it finally culminates instead of being excited. Other plot lines, such as one of the Scavo son's affair with a married woman pop up and then disappear with a half-assed resolution. The Lynette Scavo character's increased emasculation of her husband, Tom, which was present in previous seasons reaches an annoying pitch as does the Susan character's incessant whining. Perhaps it is frustration over the bad writing but character traits that were an intentional part of the character's makeup for the purpose of the plot development reach the level of annoying and make the characters unlikable. In the past it was obvious that the characters were flawed but they were seldom unlikable.  They reach that point in this season. I found myself hoping the villain would kill Susan. I saw season 1 years ago and recently got hooked when, on a whim, I bought season 2 at a discount store. I have since watched seasons 3-5 in rapid succession. This is simply not as good as previous seasons of Desperate Housewives and makes me wonder if I should buy the next season or not. I realize that a writer's strike truncated season 4 and can only wonder if this season was written by scabs hired while the real writers were on strike.",1403913600,2,1552,4.684981684981685

3823342,4,B001VPJYZK,"At the fourth season's end, the story fast forwarded five years into the future, and we now see life on Wisteria Lane starting from 2013, one year after the show's last season was on TV. Much has changed for our housewives. Susan has left Mike and raises her son MJ, Bree is a professional caterer with Catherine ever since Orson went to jail and Danielle took back her son, Lynette's children are teenagers, and Gaby's a mommy. As for Edie, well, she is back and for the better for of all the Wisteria Lane characters, she is truthful about who she is, what she wants in life, and she doesn't hesitate in saying it out loud. Not only that, she is married to a new husband whose intentions are not that honest.

Of what hasn't changed, Fairview still has a Season Mystery in which our Housewives are involved, while their own lives get out of control as we see them solving their problems with unethical solutions. However, I think that Marc Cherry, instead of preparing his plotlines with the same care as in the first four seasons, started to lack direction and fresh ideas in his storylines. Indeed, at the first season, Desperate Housewives intrigued me because it was a clever satire/tragicomedy on Suburbia under the covers of a Soap Opera. Which was how the show could be sold according to Cherry. But after the incredible success of the first season, which never happened again during the show's course and went downhill, I felt Marc Cherry wanted to recapture this success by reusing the same plotlines that made the first season a success.

For instance, Lynette learns that one of her sons has sex with the mother of his friend, a mother whose husband beats her. When he is unmasked, her son warns Lynette that if she tells that man the truth, he will leave Lynette's house. And this is where I found the show less interesting because to me, and to other people who agreed with me, this plotline, along with others in the final seasons, were too similar to storylines used in the first four seasons. And I was glad to see that in the Bonus Feature ""What more do I need - A Very Good Read"", which discusses the writing process for the episode in which Lynette's son is unmasked, a writer warns everyone that the storyline is too similar to what Bree lived through when Danielle warned her mother that she would leave home if Bree tried to stop Danielle's relationship with her History Teacher.

Secondly, several contradictions appeared in the show. First in Mary Alice's narration, and then into the dialogues. For Mary Alice's narration, she says that, after Lynette's son is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, the breakfast the Scavos did was the last they ever took together as a family. But guess what? A few episodes later, they were all back and happily eating together again. What happened in that sudden change of storyline? Was Cherry afraid of upsetting some of his viewers, which the ""What more do I need - A Very Good Read"" revealed as some of the writers showed concern of not upsetting fans with their storylines? And for the dialogues, I was astonished to see Lynette say at the twenty-sixth minute of the episode 17 (The Story of Lucy and Jessie) that she is forty-three while Tom say he is two years younger, which means forty-one, the same age Tom was in the first season when he said to Lynette that if he didn't get a high position in his office he would be nothing. Did Tom and Lynette drink at a secret fountain of youth or what?

Back to the warning Marc Cherry got from a writer in the bonus feature, Cherry agreed with the storyline's similarity and gave a subtle difference to what Lynette does in comparison to Bree. However, it was while watching this making-of, along with the uninspiring bonus features ""I Know Things Now: Desperate Housewives celebrates 100"" and ""So Very Teri"", that I felt the show became complacent. Which even Nicolette Sheridan said in interviews after her controversial departure from the show, both behind-the-scenes and in the show. And speaking of Edie Britt, her death bothered me because apart from Mary Alice's mystery, Gabrielle Solis and Bree, she was the other reason why I loved watching Desperate Housewives. She was funny, she had guts, she was a unfair loner who deserved better respect, and one of the few that did and said what the other housewifes wanted, but never admitted to themselves and their families. And as Edie dies in the middle of the fifth season, I cannot help finding her accident, and the special episode dedicated to her, sour-tasted as Marc Cherry got rid of one of his show's most popular character. One I definitely preferred over Susan's relentless romances and annoying clumsiness.

Of the season's highlights, my only favorite episode was the 100th, dedicated to Eli Scruggs, a handyman whose actions influenced all the housewives on Wisteria Lane. Even though this episode was made up at the last minute, as Cherry said in the commentaries, it was nice to see a small tribute to the consequences of a secondary character's actions.

As such, I give the show four stars mostly because of the season's excellent mystery, and for Edie Britt, who has always been to me one of the main housewives on the show.

PS: Did any of you noticed how Nicolette Sheridan's face was blurred in the making-of ""What More do I need - A Very Good Read""? Did her conflicts with Marc Cherry and ABC resulted in this censorship or did something else happened? Very weird to see that blurred face on the screen.",1352332800,,5495,4.682194616977226

I enjoyed it immensely always laughing out loud at some of the messes these wives (characters) could get themselves into.  When it went off the air I decided it was something I would watch again so I started to buy the DVDs.  Great series and I won't go into analyzing the ups, downs and sideways writing of the show but just give it a 5 star rating and say I'm glad to own all of the DVD's.

That was when I rushed to Amazon.com to purchase BOTH Season 5 AND 6. And I was not disappointed. Season 5 has been as riveting as the other 4 seasons before that.

Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons.

I can't believe how weak some of the men are on this show. I've only seen season one and jumped to season 5, to see how the show progressed. I was shocked at the turn around of events. It seems that all these women are the same, just at different moments of there lives. They switched roles in there lives over time, like kid switch seats, playing musical guitars.  I also enjoy the acting......... there all just wonderful actors and actresses.

Now that I have watched half of the first and a hand full of episodes in the 5th season, I can see that the show has stayed steady. I hate watching shows that fall off and change by the middle of the second season and become a shell of themselves. I plan on buying each season at a time and watching them with my girlfriend.

It's not the same as sex in the city, which I used to watch in the first couple of seasons, but it's very similar. One thing that I like more about this than Sex in the City is the fact that the all live in the same neighborhood.",1259798400,,1263,4.185185185185185

Like everyone else, I couldn't get enough of those early seasons.  Even the pretty crummy Season 2 was on my must-watch list.  By the time Season 5 rolled around, and in spite of the fact that I owned the box sets of Seasons 1-4, I'd lost interest in the show.  I didn't catch a single episode of Season 5 as it was broadcast, and didn't intend on buying the Season 5 box set, especially given the steep price.  And then one night, I happened to catch a rerun of an old ""Housewives,"" and--I guess I was feeling nostalgic--I bought the Season 5 box on a whim, using 1-Click ordering.  I bet if I hadn't used 1-click, I would have never gone through with the purchase.  And I would have missed out on what was for me the most enjoyable of any of the ""Desperate Housewives"" seasons.  The central characters have never been sharper.  Or funnier.  Or more touching.  The guest appearances by Lily Tomlin and Beau Bridges are absolutely fantastic.  And the stories surprised me at every turn, just the way I expect this series to do.  I'm sure some will disagree with me here, but I have to say, I loved every minute of all seven disks in this box.  This show may be past its heyday in the eyes of the general public, but for those in the know, Season 5 is a secret worth passing on.  Don't say I didn't tell you.",1256083200,,1420,4.325757575757576

3823395,4,B001VPJYZK,"After a fairly lackluster fourth season, the producers of Desperate Housewives knew they needed to do something fairly dramatic to reinvigorate the series. What they did - jumping ahead five years in the ladies' lives - certainly wasn't untried, but it was a big gamble given fans' strong attachment to these characters. In true soap fashion, the twists and turns were dramatic, surprising, and in some cases a bit crazy.

Assuming you're a fan and have kept up on goings-on to this point, a brief summary looks like this:

Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season finds Lynette (Felicity Huffman) in more banal suburban drama, with a teenage son chasing cougars and a husband who continues to live largely in his own head, ignoring everything around him. Bree (Marcia Cross) has become a minor superstar with her Martha Stewart-esque line of products and recipes, which doesn't go over well with her ex-con husband (Kyle MacLachlan), who takes it as an attack on his machismo. How does he vent those frustrations? He turns to kleptomania, of course.

Meanwhile, Mike (James Denton) and Susan (Teri Hatcher) are suffering a failing marriage as a result of a car crash; an unfortunately all-too-easy and overused dramatic device borrowed from daytime dramas. The only good thing about the split are the objects of their affections: Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delaney) and Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold); unfortunately, respectively.

The clear winner of the ""Oh my God, no they didn't!"" award for appalling changes clearly goes to Gabby (Eva Longoria-Parker), who's not only gained ""a few pounds,"" but now runs around in sweats with her fat daughters and struggles to take care of her poor blind husband (Ricardo Chavira).  Her biggest problems however, involve the struggle of knowing her daughter will never be a beauty queen... and keeping her away from ice cream, cake and French fries.

The storyline that ties the ladies together revolves around Edie's (Nicolette Sheridan) husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough). Although he's got most of the neighborhood fooled, Karen (Kathryn Joosten) and her sister (Lily Tomlin) know something's going on. (They may not know of his affliction for murder, but the fact that he talks to himself prompts them to begin snooping.) But what's his secret? Sadly - at least for many gay viewers - this season finds less witty social criticism and charm, and more simple melodrama.

Whether or not the ""surprise flash-forward"" injected new life into the series is up to you; reviews have been mixed. Having the complete series on DVD however - and being able to watch the entire season in fewer sittings - does make it easier to swallow such a dramatic leap.

<slug>Special Features</slug>

The ""extras"" for Desperate Housewives: Season 5 are fairly standard, but also pretty juicy. The first and 13th episodes of the season feature Commentary Tracks, largely focused on the decision and rationale behind the flash forward plot device. The track on the 100th episode - featuring creator Marc Cherry and actress Brenda Strong - also provides a hint of clarity behind a couple of the more obtuse storylines, tying in real life events (namely Mr. Cherry's loss of a ""close friend"") to plot points in the series.

Perhaps the most prominent extra is a featurette on the 100th episode - Desperate Housewives: Evolution of a modern classic - which features interviews with the actors, producers, and others involved in the series. This behind-the-scenes look at the production gives a bit of a glimpse into what goes into making a series, the relationships forged, and some of the on-set craziness. It also shows an early table read, which is fun, and something fans will definitely enjoy.

Cherry Picked is a brief commentary from the series creator, in which he talks about the moments of the show that mean the most to him. Additional features - which shouldn't be missed - include the standard Bloopers and Deleted Scenes.",1253232000,,3960,5.067588325652841

3823398,2,B001VPJYZK,"Believe it or not, I'd never seen DH until earlier this year (maybe an episode here and there).  At the suggestion of several friends and family members, I began watching season 1.  I fell in love with the show and bought each following season.

While I was watching these, I wasn't watching season 5, waiting to watch them all together.

I am so disappointed with this season!

Where do I begin?

I hate that they jumped 5 years.  But since they did, why on earth do they present plot lines through flash backs in almost every episode?

Does anything good happen to these people this season?  Carlos got his sight back, that's pretty much it.  All the hard times on everyone proved for depressing viewing.  I'm having hard times myself, I don't need to see it on Wisteria Lane.  What happened to all the comedy?

I can't believe they killed off Edie.  Huge mistake.  The show won't be the same without her.  Edie was fun, and her quick wit and sharp tongue always cut to the truth of the matter.

While I'm on the subject of Edie, does anyone believe for a minute that Edie would give Dave the time of day, let alone marry the guy?  He is totally opposite the type of guy she likes.

And as everyone points out, really stupid mystery.  A child could figure it out right away.

The gay couple which were introduced in season 4 are barely utilized in season 5.  For the first few episodes, they're merely decoration.  Marc Cherry, a gay man, should be ashamed of himself.  He is really letting down a huge fanbase of the show.

The men are all pretty useless this year, except for the ""villian"".  Orsen becoming a clepto? Come on!  Tom having ANOTHER mid-life crisis?  Been there, done that.  If only Gale Harold hadn't had his motorcycle accident, I wonder what they would've done with his character?

Terri Hatcher was completely annoying this season, and she was always one of my favorite characters.  They made Marcia Cross's Bree as cold as stone this season.  We saw nothing beneath this woman's hard exterior.  And what a pity about Dana Delany.  This great actress had to make do in season 5 with whatever paltry tidbits they threw her, after giving her such a great storyline in season 4.

So what, in my opinion, recommends this season at all?

The Eli Scruggs episode--flashbacks, but really great sentimental writing.  Outstanding performance by Beau Bridges.

The episode where the girls scatter Edie's ashes--again with the flashbacks, but Nicolette Sheridan really shines before fading out.  Also some of the loveliest writing of the season.  These 2 episodes ALMOST re-deem the season.

Eva Longoria's Gabrielle is finally humbled by poverty (enough with the head bands, though), but mid-way through gets back to her shallow self.

They do a little more with the Karen McCluskey character, who is great fun.  Maybe she'll fill Edie's shoes.

The children of Gaby and Susan are adorable (but I miss Lynette's little ones).

Anyway, if you purchase this season, it will be because, like myself, you've become attached to these characters, and want to follow them, even during the down seasons.  And every great show has at least one of those.

Let's hope they come back in Season 6.",1252022400,4,3195,4.704710144927536
3823399,5,B001VPJYZK,"There are many who watch TV & Movies who want to know the entire story, from start to finish, and in just that order. There are also those of us who don't mind a story ending in a question, causing you to think and use your imagination. Thus, I felt it was brilliant of Marc Cherry & ""Desperate Housewives"" to flash forward 5 years, making viewers wonder what had happened in the meantime to put the lead characters in the situations being shown: Edie Britt is now married to a too-good to be true man; perfect couple Susan and Mike are divorced and she is having an affair with her housepainter; Gabrielle has become the frumpy mother of two overweight children; Bree has become a famous TV personality; and Lynette struggles with her teenage sons.

At the end of Season 4, the show was dangerously close to ""jumping the shark"" by almost going over the top with some of their storylines. Jumping ahead 5 years and adding a number of surprising plot twists has kept the audience guessing. For those who love a little mystery in their TV diet, this season will keep you very full! As always, it's the ensemble cast and leading ladies that give the laughter, tears, and originality to this show created by the brilliant (and sometimes twisted!) Marc Cherry.

SPECS: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (good and clean; doesn't make a lot of demands on your speaker system though); Spanish & French subtitles; Widescreen (1.78:1) - Enhanced for 16x9 TVs (picture is excellent; bright colors, sharp details)

BONUS FEATURES:

-""What More Do I Need?"" A Very Good Read: Behind the scenes look at how the process unfolds from script to screen. See the cast at a very large table, doing a ""table read."" The one time that the entire cast is together rehearsing each episode. As Marc Cherry says, ""It's the first moment where I realize--Good! This is going to work!"" Excellent featurette and very interesting. (11:15)

-""I Know Things Now: DH Celebrates 100"" (20:49): Take a look back at 100 episodes. As narrator Brenda Strong says, ""100 episodes? Did that really happen that fast?"" Richard Burgi (Karl Meyer) correctly credits Marc Cherry for the series' success and longetiviy. Especially amazing in this day of focus on youth is that the leading ladies are all over 25, and definitely some of the most dynamic womeon on TV today. Their camaraderie and depth creates a synergy seldom seen. This show has the perfect blend of comedy and drama. It is obvious from the interviews that the cast truly enjoys being part of this ensemble.

-""So Very Teri"" (8:04): I wonder if the other ladies are slightly jealous of this featurette focusing on Teri Hatcher. However, her comedic skills and ability to do drama are pretty fantastic. See some of her best scenes and learn how she compares her acting to ""dancing.""

-Cherry-Picked: Creator Marc Cherry's Favorite Scenes (with or without Cherry's commentary): Definitely watch these 7 scenes with Cherry's narration: Gaby's New Game, Croquembouche, Pot Roast, Fire!, Edie & Eli, Quote The Ad Wiz, Jackson?

-Bloopers (6:24): The typical flubs and hijinks that you would expect from a blooper reel

-Deleted Scenes: 8 scenes, including What More Do I Need? (alternate opening), Out In The Open, Memory Lane (fun scene with Edie & Eli), Aversion Therapy (Bree at her demented and controlling best), Last Call (VERY funny yet also touching scene with Edie & Lynette), Mike Takes The Blame, Goo Goo Eyes, The Right Choice

3823400,2,B001VPJYZK,"Don't you think that the characters are becoming catoonish? More then ever, we feel the screenplay behind their actions and words. They should have stop at season 4. The way it ended was perfect. Everything was brought to a conclusion and you jumped 5 years ahead for the last ten minutes just to have a sense of their future. Plus, you even had the cliffhanger of Susan and her mystery man. It just made you say that everything was going to be as always. It was the perfect way to leave. Like ""Senfield"" or ""Cheers"". Always leave them wanting more is the motto. Now, they want to keep on doing this for a couple more seasons... At some point, we'll just stop watching it, i guess. It's sad.

Am i the only one who thinks that the Lynette character is becoming more and more manipulative and mean? Why is Felicity Huffman accepting this? Doesn't she have the power now to ask for rewrites?

And what about the men? All soft and weak.

Yet, you find yourself being caught and watching it. Must be the writing and the charisma of the actors and actresses. But they need fresh blood as for the screenplay writers. Not because the old ones are bad. But because they are too much in that world. They need talented people who will turn it all upside down. Jumping five years ahead is not sufficient. At the end, it was the same thing all over again.

Just think that they want to keep on going with more seasons. You don't have a choice. New writers. New points of view. Don't wait for people to just stop watching it. Leave with a high.",1251763200,5,1531,4.380281690140845
3823401,5,B001VPJYZK,"""Desperate Housewives"", the popular ABC drama series (created by Marc Cherry, ""The Golden Girls"", ""The Golden Palace"", ""Amas de casa despesperadas"") which started back in 2004 definitely has gone through some major ups and downs with its dark comedy storylines to its complex marriage or relationship problems but if there is one thing definite about the series... its that the the fans love it and to keep the fans interested, the series went through a significant change for its fifth season.

""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition"" on DVD features 24 episodes (episodes 88-111).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  ""Desperate Housewives"" looks very good on DVD.  Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.  For the most part, cinematography for ""Desperate Housewives"" has been excellent and the editing top notch.  The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, ""Desperate Housewives"" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven.  For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable.  The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little).  For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.

The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The fifth season of ""Desperate Housewives"" was the best reboot or kickoff of the series since its first season.  There is only so much that these women could experience and with all said and done, it was time for major changes.  And thus, the new season of ""Desperate Housewives"" which takes place five years into the future and has literally grabbed the attention of the viewers.  Also, it helps with all the hype that built up around this time jump, the 100th episode and near the end of the series, the entertainment world went buzzing about a possible death of a major character.

As a fan of the series, I really felt the series needed to get some type of jumpstart.  The tornado episodes of the fourth season was definitely significant but creator Marc Cherry and crew did a great job in setting the series up, five years into the future.  And also knowing that he had to gingerly disrupt the union of the housewives in Wisteria Lane by bringing in a major death.  But what I found quite enjoyable was to see Gabrielle in a position as a mother and to see this relationship between her and her child Juanita, definitely brings a different side of humor, than what we experienced with the other Housewives and their children.

Also, to see how the other characters have gone through significant changes and how it has affected their families was quite entertaining and the introduction of David (Neal McDonough), definitely capture that darkness that we saw in the first season, that things on Wisteria Lane are not always right. But who can't love the continued drama of Susan's lovelife, the family challenges on Lynette and Tom, Bree's eventual success and how it is affecting her marriage and as mentioned, the hilarious family antics of Gabrielle's family.  Season five truly rocked!

Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the fifth season.  I have to admit that watching the season finale definitely gave me the chills.  But in the end, I was really content and satisfied with the fifth season.

As for ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition"", the DVD set is a pretty solid release.  Many special features but I was surprised that there was no commentaries by any of the main housewives and I was hoping there would be a commentary by Nicolette Sheridan for ""Look Into Their Eyes And You See What They Know"".  But for the most part, you do get a good number of special features included in this DVD season box set.  I definitely hope ABC considers giving the series the High Definition treatment, for a DVD release, the picture quality on the DVD is quite clean and can only expect how beautiful this series would look on Blu-ray.

""Desperate Housewives"" fans, this DVD release is highly recommended!",1251763200,2,7463,4.8282111899133175
3823402,4,B001VPJYZK,"In my opinion, in its first four years on the air, ""Desperate Housewives"" has had three out of four really good seasons. The first, third, and fourth seasons were excellent. Only the second season wasn't quite as good. So going into the fifth season of this hit show I wondered if it was going to match the greatness of its best years. Sad to say it didn't. The fifth season of ""Desperate Housewives"" was its weakest season yet. I still liked the fifth season of the show, and I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 (it falls more under 3 1/2 stars than 4). But I've got a feeling that it might be running out of gas down the road in its later years to come.

For the most part, ""Desperate Housewives"" season five is still pretty good. There are plenty of moments that are funny, sexy, and suspenseful. There was nothing wrong with the acting. The regular cast is back and the acting is fine as usual. There was nothing wrong with the presence of Teri Hatcher (Susan), Marcia Cross (Bree), Felicity Huffman (Lynette), Eva Longoria Parker (Gabrielle), Nicolette Sheridan (Edie), and season four newcomer Dana Delany (Katherine) on the screen. Same goes for the other cast members as well. Along the way in season five there were some newcomers. The most notable newcomer to season five was Neal McDonough, who plays Edie's new husband Dave. This character provides most of the story arc to season five which means that this character has a deep dark secret that plays out during the season (quite similar to Dana Delany's character in season four). McDonough is very good here and there's no fault in his character's storyline.

There were other newcomers to season five, and many of the new faces were provided thanks to the five year jump that this show took at the end of season four. There are now older actors who are playing the Scavo kids (Lynette's three sons and one daughter). Susan and Mike's son, born at the end of season four, is now five. And Gaby and Carlos have two daughters (also shown at the end of season four). The storyline with the five year jump into the future I think might have hurt the show a little. I think I liked it better with the way it was. It's obvious that ""Desperate Housewives"" creator Marc Cherry wanted to make some changes so that way the show can stay fresh. Not a bad idea, but for me changes don't always cut it.

As for which episodes were the best, I'd have to say the very best episode of season five was the show's 100th episode, titled ""The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened"" (in the show's fifth season, it's episode #13). Here's an episode that takes a total departure from its regular storyline to focus on Wisteria Lane's local handyman, wonderfully played by Beau Bridges. The handyman dies of a heart attack at the beginning of the episode, and the ladies flashback on how this man affected their lives over the years. Bridges' guest appearence provided ""Desperate Housewives"" with one of its only two Emmy nominations that it received this year. Another good episode was #8: ""City on Fire"". This was supposed to be the big episode of the season, following on the heals of the tornado episode from season four and the supermarket hostage crisis episode from season three, which rank as the two best episodes of the show so far. In this episode, a nightclub fire puts the housewives and their husbands in danger. However this episode (even though its a good one) isn't quite up to the tornado and hostage crisis episodes from the previous seasons.

Besides Bridges, other familiar guest stars from season five include: Gale Harold (""Queer as Folk"") as Susan's new boyfriend Jackson (the mystery man Susan was kissing just as season four ended); Lily Tomlin as Mrs. McCluskey's sister Roberta; Gail O'Grady (""NYPD Blue"") as a promoter who Lynette thinks her husband Tom is having an affair with, but it turns out she's having the affair with one of the Scavo twins; Frances Conroy (""Six Feet Under"") as one of Carlos' massage clients who integrates herself into the lives of the Solis family which in the process upsets Gaby; Steven Weber (""Wings"") as Julie Mayer's much older new beau (Andrea Bowen, who played Julie in the first four seasons but is not a regular in season five reprised her role for this one episode); and Swoosie Kurtz (""Sisters"") as a worker at a school that Susan goes to work at who turns out to be a closeted lesbian. Besides Bowen, other regular ""Desperate Housewives"" actors from the past turn up, including Richard Burgi as Susan's ex-husband Karl; Steven Culp in a flashback scene as Bree's late husband Rex; and Christine Estabrook (also in a flashback) as season one neighbor Mrs. Huber.

Season five of ""Desperate Housewives"" has some problems. First of all the storyline, even though it's good, isn't as good as past storylines. This lead to a couple of episodes that were just downright dull. Plus a couple of minor storylines were kind of ridiculous. The most absurd was Bree's current husband Orson becoming a kleptomaniac, where he was breaking into houses on Wisteria Lane and stealing items from each house. Another problem was Gaby's selfish behavior, which was funny in earlier seasons but in season five was starting to get tiresome. One of the dumbest scenes of all time on this show comes in season five's first episode, where Gaby plays a game with one of her chubby daughters. It's where Gaby wants her daughter to lose weight by having her chase Gaby's car while Gaby drives a little bit away just as her daughter reaches up to the car. Then the daughter, very tired from all the chasing that her mom is making her do, gets on a bus and takes the bus home much to the chargin of Gaby. This is not ""Desperate Housewives"" at its best. Plus, Lily Tomlin isn't hardly given anything to do as Mrs. McCluskey's sister Roberta. Tomlin is one of our finest comediennes. Couldn't the writers given her something more to do?

Let's hope that season six of ""Desperate Housewives"" will be an improvement, but I'm not all that enthusiastic. Nicolette Sheridan is now gone, thanks to her late season departure. That's a shame because Edie was one of the very best characters on the show. But at least a familiar face has joined the cast for season six: Drea de Matteo, best known for her brilliant Emmy winning role as Adriana on the superb HBO series ""The Sopranos"", will be coming to Wisteria Lane. I'm looking forward to seeing if she can give this once great show a much needed boost.",1250985600,9,6473,4.653846153846154
3823403,5,B001VPJYZK,"This must be well written, directed and acted I tell myself.  Because if it isn't, I've turned into a complete moron.  I wish I could say that I didn't avidly see this each and every week and wholly enjoy it.  But I do.  All five seasons and this one was no exception.

Premise: 5 mostly married women in affluent suburbia and their trials and tribulations as such.  A sixth is dead, killed herself in her house at the start of season 1.  She narrates the entire show and I really enjoy her narration. The series jumped ahead five years in season five and that ended up being a good move because pursuing the same problems from the prior four seasons may have been tedious.  5 years ahead there are so many new problems that you didn't need to concern yourself with what was done.

The strength of the show is in its writing and directing.  There is not a wasted word or scene in each episode.  Each episode manages to be both dramatic and darkly comic at the same time.  This writing and directing is what keeps this show from descending into soap opera.  If the skilled use of dark comedy was not used effectively throughout, this series would descend into mawkish melodrama.  Because of this wit, style and writing, I don't really care what the recent crises are on the show, I care about seeing how they handle it as a piece of dark comic theater.

Don't worry about losing one of the housewives on this show, worry instead about the geniuses behind the camera who are creating this each week.  They are the ones who make this work.

3823404,1,B001VPJYZK,"The fifth season of Desperate Housewives was the worst one yet (possibly the worst show of the 2008-09 season). Here is a list of why it was terrible:

1)The 5 year jump---the writers went nowhere with this (except the fact
  that M.J. is five)

2)The ""mystery""---not a mystery! who didn't figure it out in the 2nd or
  3rd episode?

3)Repetitive story lines---Parker sleeping with an older woman sounds a
  lot like John and Gaby. Susan and Mike getting divorced and falling
  back in love sounds a lot like Carlos and Gaby. Many other character
  plots seem to have been seen by other characters as well.

4)The doctor---months after Dave killed his doctor, his secretary is
  still calling him...how stupid is she? It isn't rocket science to
  figure out someone's dead-she didn't even worry! This didn't make the
  season bad, it was just stupid and got annoying.

5)The 100th episode---the first few episodes were supposedly supposed to
  to prepare us for the 100th episode...which was nothing! it did not
  make one impact on the show. We had never even heard of Eli.

6)The finale---Desperate Housewives always ends in a great cliffhanger
  leaving us to feel suspense all summer. I haven't thought once about
  this one. Who did Mike marry? Great cliffhanger...not!

That is why this season was terrible.

The DVD set, however, gets a star. It is (probably) in a great package like all Desperate Housewives sets. Also, it is loaded with more bonus features than usual (possibly for sale purposes due to how weak the season was).

In conclusion, season 5 had a moment or two (i can't think of one...maybe it didn't have moments) and the star i give is for this DVD set, not the season itself.",1248134400,5,1700,4.771626297577854

3823406,4,B001VPJYZK,"After a great Start of the Season (and by that I mean the first 13 Episodes), the Season got somewhat disappointing. But what went wrong? We still had surprising deaths, juicy storylines and the usual DH Humor. The lack of a decent mystery hurt this season a lot. Everything was predictable (from the first Episode), there was no guessing left. Dave was a great character and also beautifully portrayed my Neal McDonough and it started out as a promising mystery. But soon the writers went into the obvious direction and pretty much revealed the mystery by Episode 10. The rest of the Season was Daves plan for revenge.

But not all is bad. There were some memorable episodes this Season as well as the 100th Episode of the show. It's still a fun show, and compared to a lot out there after 5 years still holds it's place as TV's best. Hopefully Marc Cherry will come up with something more intriguing for the shows 6th Season airing this Fall.

They seem to be packing a lot of Extras on the Set this time and it's nice to know that the audiocomentaries will be back (after they were missing in the Season 2 and 3 DVD sets). Unfortunately there will only be 2 audiocomentaries out this time.

I can't wait for it. I'm sure that the viewing experience on DVD with no brakes will be even better then on TV.",1246752000,2,2235,4.605527638190955

First of all, Desperate Housewives is one of the most consistently good shows on TV and every season is solid. However, season five is special in that it revamped and refreshed the series by beginning five years ahead of where season four left off. This technique provides the viewer with a slew of new storylines:

Susan: In season five, we find Susan and Mike divorced after a terrible incident tears them apart. Connected through their five year old son, Susan and Mike struggle with old feelings while beginning new relationships, Susan with her much younger house painter and Mike with Katherine Mayfair.

Lynette: Tom and Lynette continue to struggle raising their four children, specifically their teenaged twins Porter and Preston. On top of that, Tom finds himself in a midlife crisis and Lynette discovers the woes of returning to the world of advertising at age 50.

Bree: No longer a mere housewife, Bree is now an established cookbook author and businesswoman, owning her own catering company with Andrew and Katherine by her side. However, success comes with a price as she struggles to maintain her marriage to Orson, now a former convict.

Gabby: The beginning of season five finds Gabby as a harried mother of two young girls; now a house frow, she is far from the glamorous fashion model she once was. When Carlos regains his sight, Gabby and Carlos find themselves at a crossroads as they begin to simultaneously adopt and question their former lifestyle.

Edie: After being banished from Wisteria Lane five years prior, Edie returns with a new husband in tow. This husband is at the center of season five's mystery, as he has manipulated Edie into moving back to the lane so he can exact revenge on several main characters.

In all honesty, the only critique I have of this season is the mystery. In fact, I didn't find it to be all that mysterious, as I figured pretty much the entire thing out the night the premiere aired. It still remains, however, an interesting storyline to watch unfold.

There you have it. If you enjoyed seasons 1-4 of Housewives, you should definitely enjoy this. It's my second favorite season after season two, which interestingly enough was also unpopular among many fans. Negative reviews aside, this is an extremely solid season with captivating storylines and the same mix of comedy and drama we have come to expect from the show. To avoid spoilers for those of you who haven't seen the season yet, I'll just say that the finale gives us many things to look forward to in the fall, as each housewife's life takes an interesting turn.

Hope this helps,

3823408,1,B001VPJYZK,"Not much words have to be used. Season 1 was perfection, season 2 was nice. Season 3 got it's old feel back and was almost as great as 1, Season 4 was just between 2 and 3, not really good, but had it's fun moments. And then..... 5 years time.....
The actors don't really seem to enjoy it, life has left the characters and not because they have changed over 5 years. It's all just flat, it's all uninspiring and after about 7 eps. I got so bored, I just struggled to get through the episodes. Part of me still is hoping Season 6 will be as good as it used to...
But to be honest, I think Marc Cherry killed his characters early. Such a shame.",1246233600,3,642,4.062992125984252
3823409,1,B001VPJYZK,"The Fifth Season was overall kinda flat. The time jump did nothing for the series at all, and the mystery (if that's what you would even call it) was pathetic in every way. Worst of all, many storylines were picked up and then just randomly dropped out of nowhere. The season had a perfect chance to reinvent itself and it failed miserably. Gaby had the same kind of story for what, the first 15 episodes, minus the story about Carlos's boss and wife? Susan is ridiculous for all 24 episodes. The stories were just rehashed versions of what we have already seen in seasons past, Lynette suspecting Tom of cheating, again, etc. It was all just one stupid mistake after the next. Katherine turned into a weak and pathetic bimbo.  They should have killed her off instead of Edie. The mystery is solved after Episode 1 and only relies on 1 plot-point from episode 11 to 24. You know how in earlier seasons, DH would make viewers think one thing and then out of nowhere near the finale it goes a different way and leaves you in shock? And how it constantly keeps you guessing? Well people were constantly guessing and predicting something bigger was lurking because nobody could believe that the mystery was that obvious from the first episode. Guess what? It was. No jaw-dropping moments. The season was horrible all together, nothing important happened. They had a brilliant chance to start over and failed. The writers must have been on a strike of their own this season, or in a coma.",1245974400,7,1483,4.638783269961977
