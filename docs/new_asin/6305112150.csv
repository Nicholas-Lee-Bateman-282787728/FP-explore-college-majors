7883144,3,6305112150,Had some good early moments - but overall - a definite mis-fire.  I am a big Carry On fan - and I am saying this is 2 to 3 stars.truly a disappointment.,1424390400,,152,3.75
7883145,4,6305112150,"This is a delightful spoof of British Intel, there are a lot of jokes, the acting is very good, the locations and sets are great.  The only negative is that it is a little fast paced throughout the film; and there is just one thing that is sort of kooky near the end, but not so detracting from the film as a whole.  They were clearly working with a better script than for such movies as Austin Powers series or ""Spies Like Us"", but those films have a better sense of timing and pace and have some outstanding moments.  I enjoyed the film from start to finish, couldn't give it less than 3 stars and not more than 4.  Films like ""In Like Flint"" and the ""Mat Helm"" series are played more seriously than ""Carry On Spying"", but this film is not any more silly than the Don Adams' ""Get Smart"" TV show.  I think Barbara Windsor played her character just right, not over played, not subtle either.",1423094400,,891,4.279761904761905

7883147,4,6305112150,"this is not a great movie in itself, but it features lots and lots of Austin fx3 London taxi cabs. if you have one, you must have this movie. shipping and service and price were very good too.",1391644800,,192,4.078947368421052
7883148,5,6305112150,"This is another of the Carry On series. It has a beliveable plot (carry on cabby) and it's really a pretty good movie, I'm glad I got it.",1380067200,,137,3.9285714285714284
7883149,4,6305112150,"Carry On Cabby was not origanally intended to be part of the series. Orgianally scheduled to be called Call Me a Cab it was then re-named Carry On Taxi and then finally went under the name Carry On Cabby. This could hardly be anything but a Carry On film even though theres no Kenneth Williams or Joan Sims. Still the regulars that are present manage to lift this gentle comedy and there are some wonderful performances here with Hattie Jaques claiming that this was her favourite Carry On. Hattie Jaques certainly puts in a spirited performance as do the rest of the cast which includes Sid James, Kenneth Connor, Charles Hawtrey, Liz Frazer and Amanda Barrie. The owner of Speedee Taxis (Sid James) is something of a workaholic much to the dismay of his neglected wife, Peggy (Hattie Jaques). So Peggy decides to stand up and make her husband take notice and hastily forms the exotic Glamcabs and in doing so, practically steals al of her husbands regular clients. So he sends in one of his own drivers ""undercover"" to find out what its all about. Predicatable yes but is consistently amusing and stands as one of the better films in this era.
Carry On Spying marked the debut appearance in a Carry On Film of the bubbly Barbara Windsor who would become a sex symbol in the series. This amusing paraody of the James Bond films is another classic in the series. Desmond Simpkins (Kenneth Williams) along with his three extra-special agents by his side (Barbara Windsor, Bernard Cribbins, Charles Hawtrey) all plot to take on the malevolent powers of STENCH, namely Dr. Crow, Milchmann and The Fat Man, members of the Society for the Extinction of non-conforming Humans. Clues to the exact location of STENCH HQ lead the quartret of spies into the heart of Harry Lime country in Vienna, the Casbah and finally the corridors of the Orient Express.
Fun and adventures all the way with the gangs reaching new heights of invention and parody in this one. The cast are all excellent, especially Barbara Windsor who sparkles in every scene. A comic gem!",1036195200,11,2047,4.7366946778711485
7883150,5,6305112150,"I have seen 30 of the 31 'Carry On' films, and this one is the best. It was the 9th one in the series and was the first one to star Barbara Windsor as Daphne Hunnybutt. When asked for her number she replies, '38-22-35',  which happen to be her 'vital thingammyjigs'. Charles Hawtrey plays Charlie  bind, agent 0.0.0 ('when they looked at me they said, Oo-oo, Oooh!') along  with other characters. The team are on a mission- to Vienna to fight  against the STENCH men. It is so funny and the terrible puns, 'oh well,  hair today and gone tommorrow', double inuendos, 'I'm sure I'll never get  my draws off as slickly as that' and sight gags, such as when they enter a  restaurant and Kenneth Williams terrible costume of a beard and hat is  removed by a waitress, revealing the man himself. It really is a very funny  play on the spying theme with an excellant cast and wonderful story, not to  be missed!",956361600,8,904,4.424242424242424
