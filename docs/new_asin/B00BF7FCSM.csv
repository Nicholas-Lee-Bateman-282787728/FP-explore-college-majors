A wealthy cartel owner (Patrick Bergin) kidnaps a half dozen or so people to play a shark survival game. About 30 minutes into the film they figure out they were all somehow involved in his son's death. The shark footage look very different from the rest of the film, i.e. Ed Wood inserting stock footage into a film.

Acting was sad as well as the dialogue. Original title was ""Shark Week.""",1453334400,,446,4.493827160493828

5613576,3,B00BF7FCSM,"The plot for this movie could hardly be claimed as original.  It's a cross between the often filmed The Most Dangerous Game and Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None.  Eight people are kidnapped and brought to a remote island where they are informed by a permanently soused madman (Patrick Bergin) that they have only one chance to get off the island alive, survive multiple attacks from a wide variety of sharks.  Naturally, they are picked off one by one in a series of caves so dark that most of the action/deaths can't be seen.  You wouldn't even know anyone died but for a lot of thrashing, splashing, and someone announcing ""they didn't make it.""  In quick time, it's learned why these particular people have been gathered here.  It's a reunion of sorts.  The madman watches the proceedings from a safe distance, via spy cam.  He's not alone, Yancy Butler (as his `whore') is there by his side, equally soused (one presumes on some type of drug).  Their performances are very peculiar, every gesture and slur of speech fraught with hammy affectations.  For example, throughout the entire film Patrick Bergin is shown clutching a strand of pearls.  No explanation is ever given as to why they're there (I certainly hope they weren't his son's!).  Clearly, he's playing a man with few active brain cells at this point; supposedly, this means anything he says and does should be considered part of his madness and not just something screwy for the sake of being screwy.  In any case, none of the actors did anything worth bragging about.  This movie was made on the cheap, proof of that shows up in every frame, every performance.

I'm still deciding whether it's worth keeping, do I really want to watch it again.",1378598400,7,1722,4.750841750841751

8567652,1,B00BF7FCSM,"Asylum Studios production.....huge red flag. But sometimes they are bad fun! No this one. Oh dear God not this one! First Patrick Bergin is more awful than usual he looks high and drunk. Way over the top. Very bad effects the so-called sharks look like color blobs. All bad actors, not a single saving grace. The minefield scene is so very bad. The guy playing the lawyer is even worse than Bergin. The dialog is so bad too, I mean really bad, ex: Yancy Butler ( a very bad actress in her own right) says.....""a lot more easier"" where is that good grammar? The sharks appear on command? Does he control them? Are our plucky protagonists just unlucky? The whole thing is not worth anyone's time. I sincerely hope no one involved in this travesty ever worked again. Oh, Frankie Cullen may have a shot. No more Asylum products for me. They aren't even fun.",1486166400,,853,4.509677419354839
