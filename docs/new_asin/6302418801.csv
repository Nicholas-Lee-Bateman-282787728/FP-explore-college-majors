7825372,3,6302418801,"I am always amazed at the things acrobats can do in terms of balance and flexibility and the acts on this DVD are no exception.  The program runs only 40 minutes and includes six routines by female acrobats.  The six include: plate spinning (multiple performers), kicking bowls (while on a unicycle), balancing on benches (stacked nearly 30 feet high), flying plates (basically just catching them with some comic relief thrown in), stunt cycling (multiple performers), balancing on a stationary bicycle, and Pagoda of Bowls (balancing bowls while performing with amazing flexibility).  All the performances are accompanied by English narration/commentary.

Although the performances are very good, the production values hurt the presentation.  The DVD is copyright 2008, but the material is copyright 1992 and some of the comments give the impression that the performances might have been filmed in the early 1980s (and look like something from the 1970s).  Not bad, mind you, but they do have a dated look and some of the editing is less than smooth.

Overall I thought this disc worth the price, but those who aren't already fans of Chinese acrobatics might enjoy it less due to the quality of the production.",1225584000,7,1211,5.1479591836734695

7825374,5,6302418801,This video is just a must for everybody interested in circus arts. The women in the show display the finest in acrobatics. Stunning perfomances and always with a smile!,1011139200,,168,4.827586206896552
