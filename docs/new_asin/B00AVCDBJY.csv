8558065,5,B00AVCDBJY,This is an excellent DVD. It is a lecture with Coach Pavao clearly diagraming and explaining the 3-4 variations that he uses against the spread on a whiteboard. I have always used most of these variations but I did learn some new ideas that can allow me more defensive play calling flexibility from this DVD. I liked the DVD so much that I bought his other DVDs on defending The Wing-T and The Complete 3-4 Blitz package. I used a lot of the concepts that I learned from these DVDs this past season and plan on implementing the coverages that he details next season. I highly recommend all of Coach Pavao's DVDs if you are or plan to become a high school 3-4 based defensive coordinator.,1417564800,,687,4.4603174603174605
