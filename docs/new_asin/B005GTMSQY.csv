4694291,4,B005GTMSQY,"I like both Salman Khan & Kareena Kapoor a lot, that's the major reason ""Bodyguard"" was mostly enjoyable (which I saw on DVD).

There are moments sprinkled throughout that give nice spotlights to both these actors.  He plays the character 'Lovely Singh' - a dedicated Bodyguard, with great strength & fighting skills, who owes his life to a rich/respected man named 'Sartaj Rana'.  She plays the character 'Divya Rana' - the Daughter of 'Sartaj', she attends college and doesn't want a bodyguard but unknown to her she is a target.

The information I've seen indicates this movie did well in India (mostly based on the Star power of these 2 main actors and good music).

The first 2/3 of the movie is silly humor, but the 3 songs/dances in that first part are good (contemporary in look/sound) and seem primarily for Salman Khan (the first song includes a 1:25 short cameo by Katrina Kaif).  The several fight scenes are well done even though over-the-top as usual (almost as impressive as 'Dabangg').  The large side-kick guy character didn't click with me, just seemed a little obnoxious.

In the last 3rd of the movie, the story/characters get better.  The remaining music video ""Teri Meri"" was really good/powerful, and has a better balance of Kareena Kapoor and Salman Khan (still can't get this song out of my head, Shreya Ghoshal has a really beautiful/pure voice - her singing is also great in movies like ""Vivah"").  The final fight scene is long and somewhat brutal, but unique enough & well done.

The ending (last 10 minutes) can seem a little odd or hard to believe, with the time sequence jumping around, but it worked for me.

Over-all the cinematography has good sharpness, lighting, color, & scenes (although no special/exotic locations).  The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio is very good, with lots of action in the back speakers.

If this is the 'Reliance Entertainment' distributed version then the DVD quality has some slight noticeable compression affects, because even though 'Reliance Entertainment' did use anamorphic format they unfortunately squeezed it onto a single layer DVD disc
(only using 4.2 GB, being a shorter than typical Bollywood movie at just over 2 hours long, they crammed in Special Features:
""The Making Of 'BODYGUARD' movie"", ""The Making Of 'I Love You' dance"", & ""The Making Of 'Desi Beats' dance"").

The END CREDITS have some 'out-take' clips shown on the left side of the screen (and some samples of the 'Teri Meri' REMIX fast tempo song version), and the ""Making Of"" also has a few funny 'out-takes'.

The first movie I saw Salman Khan in was ""Marigold (2007)"" with Ali Larter, which is a good Hollywood/Bollywood hybrid movie (98% English dialogue, good music/dances & nice story, it got me hooked on Bollywood).  I first saw Kareena Kapoor in the movie ""Khushi (2003)"", which I liked a lot (very good contemporary music/dances & 'college-time' love story).",1323388800,2,2907,4.948559670781893
4694292,4,B005GTMSQY,"The Bodyguard is one of my favorite Salman Khan movies.  He is always at his best when there is action with all his quick moves and powerful fights. In this movie Salman Khan shows a more tender side by falling in love like a 16 year old would, without even meeting this woman, only her voice over the phone. Romance is done very well by Bollywood.  Hollywood could learn a few things from this movie. Falling in love without nudity, sex or bad language. If you like romance buy this movie and then check out his other movies. Ready and Wanted are great too.",1323129600,2,558,4.355769230769231

4694297,5,B005GTMSQY,"Lovely Singh (Salman Khan) is the ultimate action hero, able to single-handedly vanquish a dozen bad guys and rescue a shipload of damsels in distress, but when he takes on responsibility for guarding a head-strong college student (Kareena Kapoor) his life takes an unexpected turn. This action-packed film is hilarious, and the music numbers are amazing even for Salman Khan, who is surely the poster boy for silly dancing.",1391558400,,424,5.159420289855072
4694298,5,B005GTMSQY,"I had seen Salman Khan in a few movies before this and while I liked him; I didn't really like the movies as a total package. Something major or minor always disappointed me. I assumed he favored unhappy movies so, I neglected to watch any more of them unless I really wanted to see somebody else in the film. I do enjoy Kareena Kapoor in her movies and the opportunity to watch this one came up. WOW! I fell in love with Salman Khan as Lovely Singh! Actually, it was a great scripted story all around; I enjoyed and loved every character in their role. I highly recommend watching this movie. It has great songs, dance numbers, love, romance, humor, action, thrills, drama, and surprises! I totally love it! It also has some bonus behind the scenes making of the film segments which you've got to watch too. Salman Khan has the most charming laughing. I can hear it in my head; it's making me smile! Yes, yes, yes; a thousand times yes - I HIGHLY recommend this film and purchase!",1388620800,,981,4.425414364640884
4694299,5,B005GTMSQY,Salman Khan is truely amazing. He can act and he is very sexy. He can show his tough side but also his tender side . He is my Bollywood hero.,1385078400,,141,3.7333333333333334

4694301,5,B005GTMSQY,"This movie is absolutely amazing! It has romance and action! It will leave you laughing, cheering, angry, sad, but overall it will leave you feeling happy at the end! The story of Lovely and Divya is farfetched but that's what makes it better! People want to believe that things like that can happen! I never saw this particular twist in the story coming! It was totally unexpected but it made for a better ending! It put a stop to what you might have thought was a predictable ending! 5 stars for Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor!",1373414400,,529,4.520833333333333
4694302,2,B005GTMSQY,"I've been told that the second half is much better, but I could barely sit through the first 90 minutes.

I love Bollywood, and I really wanted to like this (especially since Meri Teri is such a nice song). But it is one of those movies with ridiculous and superfluous action sequences that defy physics for no apparent reason. It wasn't even that they were overboard, there was just so much of it that it not only didn't add to the story, it slowed down the movie.

I just couldn't get into this at all, and I don't know that the average American would like it. But, if you have different tastes than me, and you're into those over-the-top action movies, you might enjoy it.",1371340800,,675,4.392
4694303,4,B005GTMSQY,"This is a subtitled bollywood movie.  All I can say is that my wife and I liked it.  We had already seen it a couple of times BEFORE we purchased the DVD, so that must mean something.  But my wife and I are used to watching subtitled movies because of our fondness for other non-English movies (Japanese, Chinese, etc.) and I know there are many people who may not enjoy a movie with subtitles.
But as far as the movie goes, it has action, comedy, romance, silliness (personally I enjoy a bit of silliness now and again), some singing and dancing, and various moments of suspense.  Oh, and an interesting ending - not unpleasant at all.",1368748800,,636,4.456896551724138
4694304,5,B005GTMSQY,This was better then when the channel aired it on tv. Salman Khan does it again you never get tired of watching it.,1366588800,,115,4.043478260869565
4694305,5,B005GTMSQY,This movie was excellent Salman Khan was fabulous the story line and the other characters were great too. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys watching Bollywood movies or like me they love Salman Khan,1361404800,,207,4.777777777777778
4694306,3,B005GTMSQY,A very different kind of movie for Salman - music was great. The end of the movie was sad but hopeful - I liked that !,1353801600,,118,3.576923076923077
4694307,5,B005GTMSQY,After being bugged by my son to buy this movie I am glad I did. I laughed cried and fell in love once again. Love bollywood movies! Recommend this movie to all! Choli choli!,1353110400,,173,4.117647058823529
4694308,4,B005GTMSQY,"I liked this romantic, silly, light-hearted film. Salman is playful while also laughing at his own superman image at times. Two of the songs are just awesome- Tere Mere and I love You. Worth a purchase and multiple viewings.",1349222400,,224,4.769230769230769
4694309,5,B005GTMSQY,"Bodyguard is my favorite Bollywood movie with Salman Khan in it so far.  Loved the action and the music.
The movies has a very interesting twist in it towards the end , when Maya, the best friend, is supposed to go tell him the truth at the train station, but then decides she wants him for herself! I totally did not see that coming.
Love the song Teri Meri.  It also has a lot of funny parts, like when Loveley goes to school with Divia and gets kicked out of class.  The action scenes are cool, even if unrealistic, but that's what typical Bollywood movies are all about, unrealistic, flashy and ""feel-good"", I wished Hollywood would make movies like this!! Plus then there is Salman himself, what a hot guy, love his abs:)",1334880000,,726,4.443609022556391
4694310,4,B005GTMSQY,"This isn't the first movie I've seen with Salman in it which had a strange ending, but overall, this movie was very entertaining. The songs were decent, the storyline was hearlfelt and involved. Yes, a tiny bit comical, but not much. This is certainly one of his ""action"" movies - along the same lines as Dabaang, Wanted, etc. I really enjoy his more action orientated movies. Yes, it is a romance as well - but that's what Salman's good at - romancing girls and beating up the bad guys. ^_^ That's why I love watching him! He really brings his all to the table and that's what makes him such a great actor.",1331683200,,607,4.380530973451328
4694311,3,B005GTMSQY,"Quite a disappointment it was. My friend Karkee kept asking ""when the story will begin"".We went in expecting a thrilling movie at least equal to Salman's previous movies. But it was quite a bleak shadow in comparison. It was run of the mill story-telling with situations copied from ""Main hoon Na"" ,""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"" and even Robot. Movie seemed without purpose and story not to be found or too meek. It seemed like a B-grade movie mixed with Ekta Kapoor's soap operas.

Salman though looked good here and his action scenes are good. Kareena looks not so good and remind me of Manisha Koirala in her later years which is surprising since she looked great in Golmal 3. Raj Babbar and Asrani here reminded me of ""Nikaah"" ,Raj Babbar got a good role here. Their is a fat man here called Tsunami Singh who evokes much laughter and present a very weird sight when he runs shirtless. Villains here are not given much importance and are their just to take blows. This movie is treated like a serial even good songs wasted. Helicopter effect is quite childishly done where a small helicopter fitted with a camera pursues Kareena and tries to kill her. Though the bat sequence where it gets covered by a cloth and then it flies here and their girls thinking it be some spirit is better. You can see it to pass your time if you have nothing better to do.",1327968000,,1347,4.497959183673469
4694312,1,B005GTMSQY,"There was nothing new in the plot line of a person being protected and eventually falling in love with the protector (bodyguard in this case). Same old bad guys chasing our victim and being trounced by the bodyguard. And, in terms of the obligatory dance and song there was nothing memorable or creative in that regard either. In fact the movie seemed to be a little too narcissistic from both the actors and settings. What is more disturbing is that Bollywood seems to be churning out the same fantasy dream to a population that lives in some of the world's worst non-healthy environments (extremely poor air, water, soil and food quality); a population that averages $750 per year and spends over 30% of that income on food whereas in comparison the US income averages $40,000 but only 6% on food. I thought that Dhobi Ghat was a more realistic and enlightening film. Perhaps Bollywood censors should spend less time on controlling how much skin is exposed and enforce a ten new wells financed and drilled per film policy from the parasitic Bolly film industry.",1327449600,3,1063,4.782608695652174
4694313,2,B005GTMSQY,I look for comedy in Salman movies. This one is a bit more romantic. No or very poor comedy. Did not like this.,1326931200,3,111,3.869565217391304
4694314,3,B005GTMSQY,A fun action/comedy/romance which is dragged down by on overlong coda. Salman Khan plays his well-honed earnest tough guy character again but I can't fault him for sticking with such a winning and amusing formula since he does it so well and I still enjoy it.,1326240000,5,259,4.6521739130434785
4694315,1,B005GTMSQY,"I bought this after watching some of the clips of the film, only to find after buying it that it is not a love story with humor, at least not if compared to other enjoyable films such as monsoon wedding, or Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Acting is pretty cheesy. Its more like a C rated movie than a B. Anyone want to buy a dvd with only 45 minutes watched? I would give this half a star if i could.",1325980800,,389,3.814814814814815
8472333,4,B005GTMSQY,"Bodyguard Lovely Singh (Salman Khan) has been assigned to college student, Divya (Kareena Kapoor).  She is frustrated by having him tag along and comes up with a plan to distract him: by giving him a secret admirer.  Divya's plan works well, and Lovely falls for the mysterious Chhaya of the phone calls, but Divya never foresaw the results of her actions.

This film is a mix of action, romance, and drama.  Khan's character is a too-serious, over-conscientious one, and the movie pokes fun of itself through him in a thoroughly funny way.  The fight scenes are unbelievable, but no less enjoyable for that.  The musical scenes, costumes and film work are average.  The story, though, becomes entirely engrossing, and throws a few surprises.  Overall, I recommend it, as long as the viewer knows not to take it too seriously.",1490227200,,826,4.892086330935252
