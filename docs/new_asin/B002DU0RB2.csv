If you have seen them live, you still need to get this DVD. The Acacia Strain knows how to put a show on. The Acacia Strain is one of the best bands to see live.",1268352000,,308,3.9047619047619047
3912768,5,B002DU0RB2,"As a long-time fan of The Acacia Strain, I've seen them many times live and it's always a blast. The same goes, mostly, for seeing any band that you enjoy live. It's a different experience than just listening to the recorded songs on the album. The Acacia Strain always gives off awesome energy at their live shows and this DVD encompasses what it's like to be at a show. The performance at the Palladium demonstrates how TAS can tackle a long set-list and just keep pumping out song after song. The second disc with the smaller show represents a more personal setting at a smaller venue and shows you what it might be like when security guards aren't doing everything they can to keep kids away from the stage. The second disc show is full of sing-alongs, pile-ons, etc.

If for some reason you've never seen TAS live, or you can't because you live in another country or something, this is definitely a great representation of what it's like at their shows. Or even if you're a fan whose seen them many times like me, it's a good way to get a fix when you know they won't be coming back around for a while. Excellent DVD.",1266364800,,1122,4.420289855072464

TAS goes the entire show without losing any energy.
Great sound quality and excellent camera angles. Plenty of crowd shots to see how they get the people moving.
As usual, songs begin with some of Vincent's 'ignorant' rants which are always great to hear.
The dvd also comes with a second disc with a much smaller more intimate performance of

even on this performance the sound quality is excellent. Obviously, less cameras for this.

dvd also has a 30 minute 'retrospective' on the band
its a good show, but i was looking for more on the history of the band and lineup changes, but its still good to watch a couple times

some fans who bought special packages got a 10 second rant on camera, and some of those are pretty funny

finally, videos for skynet, angry mob justice, and smoke ya later

so if you are a fan, you will definitely enjoy this dvd. its a 21 song setlist so you can't complain.",1266364800,4,1489,4.392727272727273

8366036,4,B002DU0RB2,"I will keep this short and sweet. Brutal is such an overused word in the modern day metal scene but this live performance encapsulates that word to it's fullest potential and then some. The Acacia Strain deliver one of the most powerful and raw performances documented to date for any metal band and it shows through the constant movement of the crowd culminating to one of the nastiest endings to a concert I have ever seen (you'll know when you see it...). For fans of deathcore/metalcore (since we have to label everything nowadays), please pick this up. It's well-worth your money. STAY METAL!",1370217600,,597,4.805825242718447
8366037,4,B002DU0RB2,"Good DVD with a plethora of songs spanning the bands catalogue of music. If you're a fan I highly recommend this DVD! If you're not familiar with them, I wouldn't recommend it until you checked out at least two of their earlier albums.",1356566400,,235,4.488372093023256
8366038,4,B002DU0RB2,"I have seen The Acacia Strain live twice (the second time at the upstairs stage of the venue they played at on disc one) and this dvd shows exactly how awesome seeing them is. Plus with listening to the hilarious ""10 Seconds Of Fame"" videos, the great music videos, and the interview that tells you their story and lets you know a little bit about the members themselves, you really can't go wrong. But, Disc 2 has a major problem, after they finish playing Whoa! Shut It Down!, you are returned to the main menu instead of See You Next Tuesday being played like it should be. I returned one copy of this dvd and bought another one and have tried multiple players so i think every copy has this problem. Someone e-mail, message, or comment if they also have this problem so i know it's not just me.",1350086400,,798,4.3624161073825505
