3737443,4,B001P42YAO,"The winner at this year's AFI Silverdocs and Full Frame Film Festival, this extraordinary film literally puts you in the eye of the storm known as Katrina using footage taken firsthand by Kimberly Roberts and her husband Scott-who happened to be residents of the ill-fated 9th Ward. The back story is amazing. Carl & Tia (who previously worked with Michael Moore) were filming in Alexandria, La when they happened upon Kim & Scott who had gone there when they were finally able to retreat from the storm. It seems that shortly before the rain and wind hit, Kim had purchased a camera for $20 on the streets of New Orleans and, instead of filming family events, turned her camera onto the devastation about to hit her neighborhood. Although totally unfamiliar with the camera, she managed to capture the harrowing experience that destroyed her community. Its utter rawness actually gives you a ""You Are There"" account that no poor Weather Channel reporter could ever convey! You are there as the Scotts' camera trains on the untouched neighborhood, on the initial raindrops, on the flooded streets below the attic where they and other folks were huddled, on the desperate 911 call where their pleas for rescue went for naught because no one was able/willing to rescue them, on the destruction of the 9th Ward after the rains had subsided. All along, Kim gives commentary that only adds to the terror of her surroundings. Although the battery power lasted only 30 minutes during the storm, there is enough pre and post hurricane footage to give the audience the full human impact that no one else could ever provide. Interspersed, Carl & Tia have provided the professional footage of the news reports and interviews that everyone across the country were receiving. After the waters had subsided, Kim and her camera walk the deserted streets. You follow Kim as she happens upon a house holding the remains of a homeless man she happened upon, and warned, just hours before the storm hit. And you are witness to the utter abandonment by their Government-especially after over 100,000 residents were unable to evacuate the city before Katrina hit the shores of Louisiana. (Scott remarks that they felt like they weren't U.S. citizens!) You follow them to a deserted Navy base where there are hundreds of unused beds, but, incredibly, they are turned away by sailors with M-16's. (You later learn that these same soldiers received Presidential commendations for their work in the city in the aftermath!) You watch as they are forced to take up residence in their old school-where their bed is made by pushing desks together. You come to realize what it was like to live in the shoes of the survivors that the news reports could never convey. As depressing as all this sounds, the film is ultimately uplifting and hopeful as it speaks volumes on the capability and fortitude of the human spirit. Kim has gone onto a singing career as a rap artist (as Black Kold Madina) and has even started a recording company (Her on screen performance of one song is quite inspiring and three of her songs grace the soundtrack.) Scott felt the need to do meaningful work and has succeeded in helping to rebuild his community-instead, as he says, of making drinks in a French Quarter bar. A small quibble: The filmmakers have correctly supplied subtitles for the heaviest accented New Orleaneans. I had just wished they had used it more as a lot of Kim's narration is indecipherable. Other than that, this is one powerful doc that is deservedly generating glowing reviews (currently 47 out of 48 critic approval on Rotten Tomatoes). One interesting side note: When the Scotts attended this year's Sundance Film Festival they attended the premiere on January 20th. Kim gave birth in Park City the next day: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The film was bought by HBO and will be shown sometime next year. In the meantime, it has opened in limited release around the country. On Friday, October 31st, it will open at The Charles Theater in Baltimore. Considering the short screening life of documentaries in most theaters, I strongly behoove you to get your behind to the nearest theater it arrives in it as soon as possible to witness this astounding film on the big screen.

3737444,5,B001P42YAO,"Good evening to you - just saw your film tonight, had the honor to shake your hand.  Wanted to say that having studied documentary film and made a couple of small ones, the integrity with which you approached this and let us get to know Kim and her family was astounding.  I cried and laughed and was enriched.  Thank you for telling her story and most of all spreading the word by traveling with the film.  I heard about your film through an independent film newsletter.  In October, I'll be in Houma, LA helping them raise awareness about saving the wetlands at the Voice of the Wetlands festival and I'll be sure to spread the word of Trouble the Water.  Amazing job and I hope you are taking pride in your work, because you deserve it.  I love the people of Louisiana and it's wonderful to see someone standing up for them.  I'll keep an eye out for when you distribute this on DVD and I'm planning to buy copies for many friends and family.  Congratulations and thank you for opening my heart.",1249171200,10,998,4.409836065573771
3737445,5,B001P42YAO,"I saw Trouble the Water in Des Moines, Iowa, and I have to thank the filmmakers for creating such an important historical document. It was really quite an experience to see this film--I think Trouble the Water is a great service to the world. Trouble the Water is truly an American classic--and documents an important view of what happened to so many people and animals in Katrina. This documentary is raw, gritty, up close and personal--yet has all of humanity in it. There are so many sequences in this film that remain indelibly impresssed into my psyche--but one in particular still haunts me to this day. It is an audio recording of a woman calling 911 after Katrina has hit. She is trapped in her house--I think in the attic or on the roof--and the 911 operator tells her there is no one to help her. The woman says ""What am I supposed to do--just die?"" in the saddest, most plaintive tone of voice I have ever heard. It is a heartbreaking moment, revealing all that failed during this national tragedy, in the most deeply personal way. I think everyone should see this movie--you will not be the same once you do.",1249084800,5,1120,4.5495049504950495
3737446,5,B001P42YAO,"I saw Trouble the Water at a packed screening a couple months ago.  As someone who doesn't know anyone directly affected by Hurricane Katrina, I found the film to be very eye-opening, even though I had already seen Spike Lee's ""When the Levees Broke.""  The film includes haunting amateur video from Kim Roberts as she and her husband Scott stay in New Orleans while the hurricane hits.  The film's story does not stop with the end of the hurricane.  Rather, the storm is just the beginning.  Filmmakers Tia Lessin and Carl Deal follow Kim and Scott on their journey out of New Orleans (and back again), as they share their story, deal with the tragedy and loss caused by the storm, and begin a new life.  Kim is the true star the film, a talented aspiring rapper who proves herself as a hero by helping her family, friends, and neighbors, survive the storm and its devastation.  I would highly recommend this film to everyone, whether you were affected by Katrina or know little about it.",1245974400,25,988,4.611428571428571
3737447,5,B001P42YAO,"Trouble the Water deserves all of the hype surrounding it: Sundance, Gotham Awards, the Academy Awards-- these nominations and wins came for a reason. I saw a free screening of this film in Central Park where the filmmakers, distribution company, and the subjects of the documentary came to promote the film to an audience that normally wouldn't be exposed to independent documentaries. The reception of the film was incredible, and the documentary itself was very moving. It really gives a human face and a closer look at Katrina other than the news footage seen on TV at the time. Zeitgeist films picked up the documentary World Cinema Documentary winner from this year's Sundance and after catching a preview screening I can say that this is a company that knows how to pick its documentaries. Afghan Star, which follows four competitors competing on Afghanistan's Pop Idol competition, is being released in late June. Keep an eye out for this documentary-- the public is finally getting more access to these incredible films that are not only entertaining but also educational!",1243900800,25,1081,5.078651685393258
3737448,5,B001P42YAO,"Kimberly...God bless you and your family. Thank you for having the courage to speak the truth and be a witness to the facts. Every American should watch this film. The only thing more beautiful than Kimberly's heart are her rhymes. I will be buying your CD as soon as I get paid. May God always smile when He says your name. Peace.

P.S.

This film is currently being shown on HBO and HBO On Demand. The review is for the HBO airing in April 2009.",1240963200,24,447,4.247058823529412

3737488,5,B001P42YAO,"First of all I would like to say this was an excellent film.  The strength, courage, fight, and sense of community that brought the survivors together and to safety featured in this movie is exceptional.  They are heroes and the greatness that comes from New Orleans.
The despicable was the Navy officer, Mike Brown, George Bush, and others seen in this movie doing nothing to help people in need. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to know the real story behind the affects of Hurricane Katrina.",1460246400,2,508,4.761363636363637

3737497,4,B001P42YAO,"This is a powerful, moving story about one 9th Ward family with video cameras who documented how they survived the forces of nature and the inhumanity of our bureaucracy.

It made me mad at George W Bush and his inept appointees all over again for the way they  mismanaged the relief for the unfortunate people who couldn't evacuate New Orleans.

I have been reading a lot about Katrina now on the 10th anniversary and have been looking for something to communicate the humanity of the tragedy. We all know that the levees broke; that 80% of the city was under water; that the Federal/State response (immediate and longer term) was practically nonexistent; that the local government was incompetent. But nothing makes you see these people who do not talk like (I suspect) most of the readers of these reviews; whose daily lives play out very differently; whose social arrangements are organized very differently.

Poor black people in America are invisible. Until you see this film.",1444089600,3,744,4.8125

It stands as the most authentic, strongest, most creative and special place in the US certainly.  It is the best place on earth in my opinion.

Through it all, the love and independence of the people of New Orleans shines through. It's not often we get to see tragedy, the human cost of tragedy and the determination of people to overcome the worst. Ultimately, uplifting.

3737522,5,B001P42YAO,"It almost defies description in terms of why I loved it.  What a horrific event.  This young rapper happened to have just bought a camera to learn photography and filming...and it was perfect timing to get some significant practice documenting.  All the news coverage at the time...the grand sweep of death and destruction, the statistics, the horrible unfolding of government mishandling seemingly at every turn was heart-wrenching but still distant.  This personal documentary changes all that to become a story of heroism--not just Kimberly's but so many people she came in contact with along the way.  This journey is truly an inside story with great hope driving their survival; their persistent spirit and connection in reaching out and never letting go of their determination to get out and get on with their lives.

I did not have all the details about the storm when it actually happened as I did not watch the news in '05. This dvd offers a very personal insight not just to Kimberly Rivers Roberts and Scott Roberts, but also everyone who was greatly affected by the storm. The near one-on-one stories and personal testimonies allows one to step into the survivors (not victims or refugees <- these are misnomers) shoes. It also show on a ground level aspect that not just mother nature, but also your own government leaders can change a life in less than a second. Kimberly and Scott were able to evacuate after the storm had passed and head up state to family, taking with them many grateful survivors, who could then try and figure out what to do next. Kim and Scott took video of much of the before and after to show dramatic changes that put into a sharp contrast what had happened to them. Also, on a good note for them and those returning to NOLA, they were able to come home and rebuild their lives. The media documentation showed great stamina and persistent fortitude in a way that demonstrates that life will go on and NOLA is more than worth saving.",1369180800,2,1237,4.453744493392071

3737531,4,B001P42YAO,"Trouble the Water is a Sundance prize winner.  Kimberly  Roberts, 24, without resources to evacuate New Orleans before Katrina, recorded with a camcorder the experience of her family and neighbors as they rode it out hunkered in her attic.  They escaped the waters with the help of a neighbor who found a boat drifting by.  Later they retreat to shelter in Alexandria, La., where they are discovered by documentary film makers who use Kimberly's footage and add their own, following up Kimberly's story and that of her neighborhood.  The film shows one example of outrageous behavior by the Bush administration that was new to me.  After the storm, Kimberly and many others were directed for refuge to the nearby Navy base, which had empty housing with hundreds of beds.  They are turned away at gunpoint by sailors with M-16s.  What makes the film memorable is the spirit of Kimberly and her husband, Scott, whose creativity and determination never cease.  She finds her calling as a performance artist, providing much of the soundtrack of the film, and he finds his as a builder, rebuilding the homes of his destroyed community.",1348617600,,1130,4.936507936507937

3737533,5,B001P42YAO,"I'm in awe after seeing this. Sooo soo sad. While the Louisiana's National Guard was in Iraq, the people of New Orleans were left with very little support from the government to make it through the disaster.

This is a harrowing 1st-hand account of what life was like on the inside of the storm, right before, during and after. The only documentary I've seen on Katrina that really gives you a taste of what it was like for the people who did not have the means to leave the city. The poor were left behind to die, and because of the heroic efforts of the people who could help their neighbors, many of them survived.

Everyone in America should see this documentary.",1285632000,,667,4.459016393442623

3737539,3,B001P42YAO,"Tia Lessin and Carl Deal provide another piece of the Hurricane Katrina puzzle in their documentary Trouble the Water. Their story is told from the perspective of a couple from the flood devestated Ninth Ward Kimberly and Scott Roberts.

The Roberts were poor and had no money to evacuate the city in preparation for the Hurricane so they stayed in their home and turned on their video recorder in hopes of capturing some images that they could sell to the news media in the storm's aftermath. The picture they present is harrowing but it is not one that we haven't seen before. Spike Lee does the better job in his When The Levees Broke. The Robert's story is interesting to watch and Kimberly Roberts is a unique local character. She is a rapper by trade and performs several of her songs in the film.

Maybe I'm jaded having lived through the storm myself. My home is very close to the point where the 17th Street Canal levee failed and I believe the problems with the city had more than a black/white basis. The issues to me were comprehensive and trying to separate them by race doesn't really move the debate forward.

The disc by Zeitgeist features some extended and deleted scenes and several Q&A sessions with the stars and the filmakers. See this for what it is another piece of the story but far from the whole story.

3737540,4,B001P42YAO,"This isn't a film that you can really put all the weight into the filming quality or storyline quality, but it offers a very rare insight into the plight of Katrina to those that couldn't evacuate New Orleans. The picture quality at times can be a nuisance because of the shaking camera, and at times the documentary feels very dry in it's delivery.

3737543,5,B001P42YAO,"With all due respect for Spike Lee's magnificent ""When the Levees Broke"", directors Tia Lessin & Carl Deal have produced an account of Katrina that is at once profound and exhilarating in it's straightforwardness. They had not set out to make the final film; it was when they met Kimberly and Scott Roberts that their idea took a different turn. The Roberts' home video footage during the storm and its aftermath is amazing and quite disturbing. Kim does the most talking here, articulating the horrors and sadness without giving in to despair nor noticeable frustration. She speaks intelligently and sensibly, giving a first-hand account of survival. Kim spares no denial of the crime, drugs and poverty, but provides honest and sensitive comments regarding government ambivalence and pure ignorance.  One must see the film to genuinely feel the pain. Many reviewers have already gone into detail about elements of the film, so I'll simply recommend this film highly. DVD extras are plentiful; lots of generous interviews and discussions. The directors have presented a powerful documentary, but I have no end of admiration for the Roberts' contribution. Not enough was said about their friend, Larry, a true hero.",1256342400,5,1215,5.198979591836735
3737544,5,B001P42YAO,"If you have not seen ""Trouble the Water"" directed and produced by Tia Lessin and Carl Deal - Rent or buy it today. It pisses you off and inspires you at the same time. We can not forget the people in New Orleans...the fight down there to make things right is not done! What impressed me the most about this film is the commitment the makers of the film had to tell the truth through their entire experience.  It was brave not just from a reality stand point...but from a personal stand point.  Whenever you hear another human being so clearly tell the truth  in the now - It humbly empowers us to do the same.

3737545,4,B001P42YAO,"Perhaps it is unfair. One week before viewing this documentary, I'd read -- with appreciation and wonder -- Dave Egger's magisterial non-fiction work, ZEITOUN. The resonance Dave Eggers has with his character and the many moral, ethical and spiritual issues the author invokes in his narrative of a Katrina survivor -- far outweigh the significance of this film.  I recognize I'm overlapping media, but there you have it.

Who could argue with the passion, decency and authenticity of Kimberly Rivers? The woman is a saint - as is her husband, as were many of her neighbors.  That, sadly, does not a five-star documentary make.

The film's greatest strength is its coverage of the hours before the storm made land, in which an ordinary community was transformed, moment-by-moment, into absolute hell. The hand-held, home-video photography works well, as do the many cut-in segments to network news and obtuse statements by George Bush, who is too stupid and culpable to even mention here.

Even so -- and unlike Egger's ZEITOUN, which exposes far more than the garden-variety racism which emerged after Katrina -- this movie communicates very little new convictions or material which might grip or educate a viewer. That doesn't mean the film is a flop. Far from it.

Unlike other Katrina films, it gives you an uncanny perspective into the ways the lives of one family were transformed by a natural disaster -- but more by wholesale neglect -- and some troubling racism too -- in the shadow of the National Guard.

And then: The National Guard should not be stereotyped as a group of puppies on Michael Brown's leash. Sensible rules tend to go south in the wake of any disaster of this magnitude.

That said, TROUBLE THE WATER will satisfy those who never saw Spike Lee's marvelous WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE, although they should see the latter first. It is sad that TROUBLE THE WATER has been hyped to an offensive degree.  So sorry, folks.  In light of the critical acclaim it's received and of the many fine accounts of the fatalities and obscenities which lay in Katrina's wake, it is a bit of, well,  a bore  -- though not for the brave families who experienced it and whose lives the film recounts.",1253577600,5,2201,4.84

3737547,5,B001P42YAO,"I live in Colorado. About a week before Katrina, I visited New Orleans for only the second time in my life, as an absolute tourist, with a daughter and two grandsons, and for the second time fell in love with a city that was so mixed, so mixed up, and so totally unforgettable that it both captured and broke my heart. And that was before Katrina mind you. Watching Trouble the Water, the truest, most REAL documentary I have ever seen (and I've seen alot of them) brought back all the feelings of utter devastation we experienced as we watched the ""news"" coverage during and after the worst natural AND man-made disaster in our country in my memory. It was a terrible moment in our history and the repercussions continue today for thousands. Hearing the story re-told by Kimberly Roberts brings to mind all the clichs - moving, horrifying, unbelievable, etc. My heart sank as she pulled on the face mask to enter the house in the Lower 9th Ward in search of her uncle. Yes, he was dead. Yes, it was two weeks after the levees broke and no, no ""authorities"" had been through their neighborhood. Yet her story and personal film footage (yes, she IS essentially a born ""journalist"", especially evident in her outrageously honest, astute, and poetic lyrics), and that of her friends, neighbors and family transcend clich, and make hope tangible. And I don't mean to imply she was the only person making an effort above and beyond; Brian, Scott, Larry, and so many others all deserve respect, and also the means to carry on - something way more useful than medals. Kudos to the official ""filmmakers"" for understanding all of that, and simply keeping the cameras rolling.",1251244800,13,1666,4.708904109589041
