1786001,5,B00006LPAI,"Dispatch, formerly One Fell Swoop, are an amazing trio of musicians who bring the FUNK to the stage. I've had the pleasure of seeing them numerous times in Boston and the New England area, and during the hiatus of Phish, Dispatch has filled a void with surprising funk and finesse! I haven't yet seen this DVD, but have been following the setbacks of it's release for the past six months, and am stoked to pick it up tomorrow, as no doubt, it will be bomb! Show this downhome, funky, good-time lovin' band some love, and spend the 20 bucks on this DVD! You will be rewarded in the viewing! PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!",1034553600,4,615,4.4035087719298245

7972010,5,B00006LPAI,"this dvd is insane.  wish they didn't break up the concert footage with interviews though.  should of just put them at the end. regardless, dispatch is an amazing band and they are crazy musically talented.  too bad they aren't together anymore...",1145059200,,247,4.975609756097561
7972011,2,B00006LPAI,"The music on the DVD is wonderful! but I really could have done without the interviews in between the song. Once you really start getting into the music, your interupted with a boring interview or story. This would have been a great special feature, but they had to mix it in during the concert footage.",1114300800,,303,4.527272727272727
7972012,5,B00006LPAI,"The DVD is worth the money alone.  ""Patchwork"" only makes this unquestionably worth the money.  The version of ""Passerby"" on this DVD is amazing, as are many of the other alternative live versions of songs on the ""Gut the Van"" album.  The bonus material is great....I didn't even watch it for four months after I owned the DVD, being that the compilation of live performances on the general bulk fo the DVD kept me happy for the time until I watched the extra features on ""All Points Bulletin,"" which piqued my interest in what could be on the bonus features here.

The cd contians live audio footage of a few of the songs from the DVD, along with remixes of ""The General"" and ""Bang Bang"" that are pretty good....they're filler, but not bad.  The DVD contains some superb versions of songs, the best being, ""Passerby,"" ""Time Served"" and a chilling just-after-9/11 (performed in NYC, no less) version of ""The General"" that, well, it captures the sentiment of the time, I'll say.  The live version of ""Mayday"" rivals the version on ""APB,"" with Braddigan kicking into a ""Shine On"" (Pink Floyd/David Gilmour)-like guitar solo in the middle of the song.

Overall, a great concert DVD with some really good camera work, that was carried through in the ""All Points Bulletin"" DVD/CD set, which is the only piece of work that really rivals this one, but the thing is, there shoudln't be cometition between them.  You should have both!",1105142400,5,1425,4.7408906882591095
7972013,5,B00006LPAI,"First off let me start off by saying that this is one of the greatest releases in live concert footage by any band in a long time.  Having been a fan since they were ""One Fell Swoop"" I have been amazed by their comeback.  This DVD and CD together are absolutely wonderful.  The DVD is packed with live footage, and interviews about how the band came to be, and some other prettty cool stories.  This DVD is loaded with extra features, where we get to see the threesome in their every day life.  The DVD consists of 19 of their best songs, mixed in with a lot of interviews.

The songs on the DVD are as follows:

1)Cover This

2)Mission

3)Two Coins

4)Passerby

5)One Truth

6)Open Up

7)Time Served

8)Elias

9)Bullet Holes

10)Walk With You

11)Bang Bang

12)Even

13)Gasoline Dreams

14)Lightning

15)Spades

16)Flying Horses

17)Mayday

18)Bats

19)General

The most amazing thing about the DVD is the amount of emotion that is put forth during the live concerts.  Also, during every one of the songs the musical abilities come foward like never before.  For example during flying horses Braddigan is playing the Harmonica and the Conga at the same time.  Dispatch is one of the most musically gifted groups out there, and I think that it comes through on this disc.

The Bonus CD consists of 7 songs

1) Bang Bang Remix

2) The General Remix

3) One Truth

4) Gasoline Dreams

5) Mayday

6) Walk With You

7) Fat Ol' Pig

I did however find a few things wrong with the DVD, but nothing to demote the DVD.  The first thing that I found was the song selection could have been a little better.  Although the DVD does include some of the best version of Mayday, Walk With You, Two Coins, Flying Horses, and Elias, I thought that they could have replaced some songs.  I thought they could have taken off Gasoline Dreams, Fat Ol' Pig, and One Truth, and instead put in some of Dispatch's better songs like Water Stop, Railway, Carry You, and most of all Steeples.  I don't know how they forgot to put Steeples onto this disc, but none the less this is one of the greatest buys dollar for dollar.",1100995200,12,2095,4.477333333333333
7972014,4,B00006LPAI,"...I got this DVD because I had never seen Dispatch concert footage. I had only listened to 'Bang, Bang' and 'Silent Steeples'. So, when I saw this DVD I was surprised to see that the three members move around the instruments a lot. The concert footage is awesome. Some great guitar solos I must say. This DVD also helps you learn about the background of the band. It explains their touring history, and their views on Napster. I love it. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is due to me not being familiar with a lot of the songs. I guess I just have to get used to it. The CD is good as well. A bunch of great tunes.",1081641600,3,621,4.098360655737705
7972015,5,B00006LPAI,"I've been a fan of dispatch for around three years now and this DVD is awesome. It has so many cool perfromances from various venues. A great performance of walk with you, mayday, the general, and an explanation of the song elias. The DVD also has bonus footage of the three members before dispatch was formed. Definately worth your time and money. Oh and it even comes with a  7 track CD.",1041379200,12,389,4.402777777777778
7972016,5,B00006LPAI,"Back when i first heard dispatch, I was hooked. My friend played the song The General for me, and i was an instant fan. This underground band sells out every venue they play, venues like the Irving Plaza... and there is a reason why. Unlike the cookie cutter teen pop bands of the day, they pur their heart and soul into every performance, they rock, and you can feel it in the crowds energy. Nobody sits, everybody sings, and it leavs you with a ""high"" for months afterwords. For those of you who have never seen them, this DVD brings you into their world. While you don't get the vibe and energy of a live show, it is still great fun. A ton of work, effort and love went into making this... this DVD was truely made for the fans. A great Buy, from a GREAT band.
