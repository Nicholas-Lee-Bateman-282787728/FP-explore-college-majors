5454952,2,B00AMSM9DG,Both movies were incomplete. How about a replacement paid for four only two were good quality. I will be glad to return for replacement,1370217600,4,135,4.666666666666667
5454953,1,B00AMSM9DG,"Although, the titles in this set are wonderful, The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill are both missing the second half of the movie. A flaw by Warner Bros that I can not get acknowledged. When The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill were originally created for DVD, they were 2 sided DVDs. These movies in this set let you watch all of what was side ""A"", but have no side ""B"". Do not purchase unless you enjoy not finishing great movies.",1367366400,22,433,4.166666666666667
5454954,1,B00AMSM9DG,"The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill discs stopped working about 60% thru the movies.  This has been noted by everyone purchasing this set on Amazon.  In addition, I purchased a set at Costco, with the same defect.",1366329600,17,214,4.461538461538462
5454955,2,B00AMSM9DG,The Pelican Brief movie was incomplete - there was only 1/2 a movie.  I was very dissatisifed with this product,1366243200,4,111,4.55
5454956,2,B00AMSM9DG,I purchased this set a few weeks ago and have just now gotten to the third movie - The Pelican Brief - and only half of the movie is included. From the looks of the other reviews I can expect the same thing with A Time to Kill. Since there seems to be lots of these bogus editions of this set out there perhaps it is time for a John Grisham style class action lawsuit!,1365811200,3,368,3.92
5454957,1,B00AMSM9DG,Save your money on this one. You only get 2 complete movies. Half of The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill are missing. Who wants to only watch half a movie? Big disappointment. Warner Brothers needs to get their act together.,1365033600,6,225,4.380952380952381

5454959,2,B00AMSM9DG,Just got this package and the Pelican Brief and A Tine to Kill only include side A???? Tried everything to find the elusive side B no such luck.  Just when the movie is getting to the good part side B which doesnt exist is required to continue watching the films. Boooooo!!!,1363219200,26,274,4.372549019607843
5454960,3,B00AMSM9DG,"This looked like a great buy--four quite good to excellent films in one package.  I received it today, but unfortunately only the first half of A Time to Kill is included.

5455063,1,B00AMSM9DG,"How does this set get even a 3? What kind a reviews like that can be trusted?! It's not nearly complete; me, I could have personally lived with it had ""A Time to Kill"" been the only missing movie--had the other ones been good(since I have A Time to Kill on VHS
and still currently use my VCR); however, that's not what happened! Both ""Pelican Brief"" and ""A Time to Kill"" did not play half to 60% of the movie! It's Warner Bros. that signed off on this mess! Also, I would rather have a movie not play at the beginning than get a movie stop in the middle and not continue? Glad it's not a Wal-mart store that I got it from; hopefully, Dollar General will honor a return on a DVD. If not, hopefully, the 2 that play all the way are great movies!",1500681600,,743,4.095890410958904
5455064,3,B00AMSM9DG,Fantastic collection of classic Grisham. The Client was very powerful. A Time To Kill is one of the all-time greatest films anywhere. The only problem was the packaging. All 4 discs are crammed on the same spool...,1499299200,,214,4.8108108108108105

5455093,1,B00AMSM9DG,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE these movies. Love them. However, ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Pelican Brief"" are shown as being ""flipper discs"" in the details; but the two ""defective"" discs are both painted on one side, thus preventing the ability to view Side B, as shown in the photos attached to my review. This means you lose half of each movie. Even if these were dual layer discs, my DVD player would play the entire thing. I'm requesting a refund and will have to purchase all four movies separately to be sure to get the complete movie on each of these. I'm kind of surprised Amazon allows this to be sold still after all of the comments. (Which makes me think they don't really read the reviews.)",1483660800,11,706,4.356060606060606
