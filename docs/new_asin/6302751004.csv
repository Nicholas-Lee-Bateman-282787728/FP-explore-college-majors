507089,2,6302751004,"This DVD was paired with the book Hatchet on the Amazon site so I bought both items.  However, I found out that this is not the movie that goes with Hatchet.  The DVD I bought is ""Cry in the Wild""  The one that SHOULD be paired with Hatchet is ""A Cry in the Wild"".  Now because I already opened it, I am stuck with a DVD I can't use.",1180051200,4,333,3.782608695652174
507090,3,6302751004,I use this movie every year with our middle school students to show how important it is to stay in groups and pay attention to your surroundings. This happened in a small town and can happen again. It is important for young people to see how much work effort and sadness takes place when a loved one is missing and may deter them from pulling pranks like not comming home or not telling people where they are. Nicely produced realistic but not over dramatic.,1155859200,2,458,4.464285714285714
507091,1,6302751004,This movie is not what we thought we were getting. this movie is not showing a picture when you order. It is not about the young boy surviving in the wilderness!!!,1152662400,14,163,4.290322580645161
507092,4,6302751004,"This movie is NOT the movie of the same title based on Gary Paulsen's book, ""Hatchet"". Despite the identical titles, this movie is based on a very real abduction and manhunt in 1963, in central Pennsylvania. Both were released on TV in 1990, but this movie had the subtitle ""The Taking of Peggy Ann."" It is a very accurate account of the kidnapping of teenager Peggy Ann Bradnick, and the ensuing search that cost the life of FBI agent Terry Anderson (played by David Soul) before the kidnapper, William Hollenbaugh, was killed by the police.

The ""Hatchet"" ""Cry"" is available in DVD from Amazon. The ""Peggy Ann"" ""Cry"" is only out in VHS.",1152576000,14,638,4.646017699115045
507093,5,6302751004,After reading all the reviews... I have no idea what movie you are reviewing.... maybe another movie called 'A Cry In the Wild'.  I saw this movie... the one w/ Megan Follows... and there is no plane crash... it's a different story where she gets taken by this crazy man and they are in the woods for a couple of days while the police try and get her.  I thought it was a really neat movie.  Great acting!,1129766400,4,405,4.166666666666667
507162,5,6302751004,"movie has one place in were it pauses, then plays again.other than that its great. price was little high for movie in that shape.",1380844800,,129,4.416666666666667
507163,2,6302751004,"There are a lot of reviews listed here for ""Cry in the Wild"" which is a film based on the book ""Hatchet"" by Gary Paulsen. The reviews were listed here by mistake by Amazon or the reviwers didn't read the movie title closelyenough to notice the rest of the tittle ""... The Taking Of Peggy Ann"". This movie is based on  a true story which took place in Central Pennsylvania in the 1960s.
This is the story of the abduction of Peggy Ann Bradnick by an ex-convict and ex-mental patient William Diller Hollenbaugh which took place in Shade Gap, Pennsylvania on May 11, 1966. The film was a made for tv movie originally airing on NBC.

the real story behind the movie is much more interesting, or at least, sounds much more interesting than the movie. I mean, the guy's name was "" bicycle pete""! all in all, the movie snt bad, especially if you like Lifetime movie style movies.",1373673600,2,872,4.44375
507164,1,6302751004,"I am VERY unsatisfied with my purchase.  They posted this movie as if it were the film for the book Hatchet by Gary Paulson.  What they sent me was some slasher movie.  I had kids who read the book.  They were extremely disappointed that I didn't receive the correct movie.  I would expect my money back at least, or a copy of the correct movie.  I ordered A Cry in the Wild.  I did not get that.  The pictured DVD is not the one I received.",1291507200,,441,4.046511627906977
507165,5,6302751004,"Based mostly on fact (the ending didn't quite happen the way it shows). Although, the famous kidnapping is almost forgotten, it was really big news in 1966. Peggy Ann continues to live in Pennsylvania maybe 20 miles from where this whole event happened. Many of the others have already passed on.

Back in 1991, a version for TV was aired. The video version that came out later had some more footage not seen on the tv special. Most VHS tapes of the movie today have aged which have been restored better in the DVD version.

If you like to see a true story with a happy ending, then buy this DVD. It's really a piece of history that will soon be lost as so many things in our fast moving culture.",1231977600,7,696,4.305343511450381
507166,1,6302751004,"My mom asked me to order her the movie Cry in the Wild.  When she received it, it was the wrong movie.  I believe her movie was The Cry in the Wild.

507168,3,6302751004,"Am I the only one that's paying attention to what's on this page or are these reviews being sent to the wrong page? All the reviews I've read here are for a completely different movie! ""Cry in the Wild: The Taking of Peggy Ann"" is a made for TV movie (1991) based on the true story of Peggy Ann Bradnick's 1966 abduction by a deranged mountain man (played by David Morse) that led to the largest manhunt in Pennsylvania history. The screenplay was written by Durrell Royce Crays. The abduction and subsequent manhunt was also detailed in the book ""Deadly Pursuit"" by Robert Cox.",1220140800,6,578,4.5673076923076925
507169,5,6302751004,"This is a very well done movie that stuck closely to the facts of this incident.  Being from the Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania, I am familiar with this kidnapping.  My brother was neighbors with Peggy's brother (as an adult) here in Lancaster County approx. 10 years ago.  I highly recommend this DVD to others.",1218931200,5,316,4.814814814814815
507170,1,6302751004,"This DVD is not the movie version of Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It has nothing to do with Brian Robeson and his survival adventure in the Canadian wilderness. It appears that Amazon is intentionally misleading people looking for the motion picture adaption of Paulsen's incredibly popular novel.  ""A Cry in the Wild"" is the title of the Hatchet movie.  This one is entitled ""Cry in the Wild.""",1188259200,14,390,4.8059701492537314

I thought it was the  movie I wanted available in DVD format instead of VHS, so I ordered it.  I think that this movie SHOULD NOT be listed on the same page as the one based on the novel Hatchet.
