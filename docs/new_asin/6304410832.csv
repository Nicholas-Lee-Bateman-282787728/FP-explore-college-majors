This film captures many of the feelings that LGBT youth have. Great acting & a wonderful story. I particularly LOVED the mother!

879063,5,6304410832,"This tough but tender film is one of the most honest and moving gay youth dramas in recent memory.
Similar to of some of Jonathan Demme's early movies, where ordinary people are celebrated for their eccentricities but not condescended to.

879145,5,6304410832,"I love this movie and I am so thrilled its been put on DVD. If you have a family member or child that is questioning or dealing with sexuality, I would recommend this movie for you and them together, even if its hard for you, because its harder for them. This is a very realistic story and growing up, it was almost a Cinderella story for me personally. I personally had a family that supported me throughout, which is why I was able to get this movie early on. The reality of how difficult life is not just for the individuals dealing but their families also. I very much love the development of the mother character and where she ends up with acceptance by the end, showing not her sadness for him being gay but her hurt for what he was going to go through because of it. As accepting as the world is today, its not enough, but MORE movies like THIS should be made. I dislike a standard amount of gay genre movies because they focus on the wrong things. Beautiful Thing focusing on the right things for the right reasons. Family, unconditional love between mother and child, choices to better ones self, and its age appropriate, I think laying together or kissing is about as ""crazy"" as it gets. If your a parent, family member, or person dealing yourself at any age, this is still a great movie to watch.",1453161600,6,1307,4.382716049382716

Word of advice, American English speakers will have difficulty understanding this, so hopefully the copy you purchase comes with subtitles. The British English is very thick. I first watched this movie in 1998, and because I love it so much, I wanted to know what everything they said meant. So I've done a lot of searching for phrases they use over the years and occasionally still come across one I don't understand. For instance, if you do not know what ""Slag"", ""Bubble & Squeak"", ""Libs"", or ""twatting"" means, you may need to look them up, but for me it was interesting. Search your favorite search engine for ""Beautiful Thing slang"" and there is one site in particular that'll help you get along in the movie, but it's so worth it.",1440633600,,894,4.658227848101266

Some of the dialogue between the boys was really sad but beautiful.  Very human.  Shows you don't need a big budget to make a great film.  This is one of maybe 10 gay themed films that I really loved and will  watch again.  Some may find it hoaky at the end but .I thought it had a touching surreal quality.  Realistic?

879514,5,6304410832,"The whole story hits so many layers with such artfulness it is surprising.  When you first see the movie, you may notice older colors and older music- especially when you see the subtitles.  If you can get past that as an American, which you should be able to because the story is just that good, then you can keep watching it.

The hot and heavy scenes are very few and far in-between making me crave for more, but they have enough to keep it a quality movie and to keep the story alive.  The humor may seem off, but they can pretty much do ""anything"" with one of their offbeat characters in the movie.

The bullying they have in there plays a minor active role, but is important to include in the movie.  Another strange twist that you have to think about or get over is at the beginning of the movie when Ste participates in the bullying to the degree on Jamie, and how Jamie doesn't seem to react harshly when Ste needs a place to stay because he was temporary kicked out of his own home because he has a crazy family.

As if that isn't enough, the way they end the movie is extraordinary!  The viewer is not meant to take the ending literally.  To be able to come up with that ending and put it all together as a story- sometimes it takes something relatively simple to do to make it a true masterpiece. This movie certainly takes the cake with that.  (Don't cheat and forward to the ending first because that would ruin the visual/emotional effect the movie can have on you otherwise.  If it doesn't affect you, you aren't empathetic or visual enough!)

There are certainly a few slight plot points for cohesion arguably, and as an American, it may be hard to understand what the movie is really saying enough that you might wonder why something happened.  The comedy or sarcasm might take a moment longer for an American to pick up than a British speaking person. Like anything else, it takes time to fancy the lingo!",1406332800,,1924,4.401129943502825
879515,5,6304410832,"Terrific but overlooked gay film.  It is a bit dated in a mid-1990s sort of way, but the story is so touching and the cast so affable.  I love the way Mama Cass was woven into the film so much that I bought the soundtrack.

879516,5,6304410832,I used to own this movie. I love this movie. If I could get away with it in would watch it everyday,1403913600,,99,3.5454545454545454
879517,5,6304410832,"This looks into the life of a youth exploring his awakening gay feelings for his friend who happens to sleep over after being beaten by this father. It is complicated, however, by his social status in one of Britain's projects. It has a happy, but simplistic, ending that is rather contrived. But it is still an above average gay flick that is worth a look. The Cockney accents of the cast was a bit hard to understand at times. I picked up a lot of nuance missed the first time round during a second viewing.

It is a better than average film for this genre with a convincing relationship between the character members. Too many of the old gay film plots are weighed down by the specter of HIV or AIDS. Fortunately, more recent gay films finally deal just with the characters and relationships.

While on the subject, I must highly recommend two other gay films. The Trick and Parting Glances. These are, hands down, the two finest gay films ever made. They are the gold standard from which you will judge all other gay genre films. I promise!",1403654400,,1044,4.518518518518518

A very true-to-life experience watching this movie with appropriate songs from Mama Cass (yes!).

879522,5,6304410832,"Based on the play of the same name, this lovely coming of age story is the most charming film of its kind--still a rarity.  The gay teen story has not effectively been explored in film (TV is starting to do it better with GLEE) and this story of a growing relationship between two lower class boys in England, their various family problems and social circumstances and how they meet and fall in love shows the gay teen experience with great sensitivity.  We also get a happy ending.  Other good films of this kind would be GET REAL and EDGE OF SEVENTEEN, but this one is king (so far).  The films I've named here are all from the late 1990s.  It's amazing that few things have come along since to match.",1395446400,,703,4.376923076923077

879693,5,6304410832,"First off, I would like to say that i find it very sad that 17 out of the 19 one star reviews about this film are all due to technical issues with the earlier copies of the DVD rather than because of any displeasure with the film itself. THOSE ISSUES HAVE ALL BEEN WORKED OUT! There are no technical problems with DVD's ordered now. It would be nice if people revisited their comments every once and awhile and brought them up to date.

That being said, this is the sweetest and most endearing love story I have ever had the privilege of watching and owning. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I have been watching this 1996 release again and again every single night since I purchased it. The story takes place at a working class apartment complex in Thamesmead, a district of South East London, UK. Although I had to struggle a bit during my first viewing of the film to catch some of the British jargon, it never detracted from my overall appreciation of the story. I also researched some of the slang and colloquial expressions in order to understand the film a little better the second time.

Sandra Gangel (Linda Henry) is a single mom struggling to make a living and raise her son. Her tough demeanor and defensive attitude are quite palatable and likeable in contrast to the 2 pieces of trash that Ste (Scott Neal) has for a father and brother next door. The dilemmas all the main characters face throughout the movie are compelling and very artfully directed. Best of all was the happy ending that clearly brought home the fact that love triumphs over all odds. The 2 boys expressing their affection and literally slow dancing in the courtyard at the end of the movie, as well as Sandra's ultimate acceptance of her son and his relationship with Ste, really touched my senses in a powerful way---especially when she and her wacky neighbor Leah (Tameka Empson) joined the boys in the dance while all the passers-by watched with varying facial reactions and body language.

The acting here is superb, the colorful characters are all quite believable, and the nostalgic music of Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas in the background throughout the movie was also delightful and paralleled the story perfectly. None of the pervasive strong language comes off as offensive or gratuitous. You can honestly believe that this is the way these people talk, and the language, quite frankly, adds so much humor and realism to the story lines.

The boys finally find enjoyment and acceptance at a Gay pub in the Greenwich area called, The Gloucester, an actual establishment located between Greenwich Park and the Footway Tunnel.

I've ordered several copies of this DVD to ensure that I will always have a copy handy for future viewings. Along with ""Shelter"" and Jean-Claude Schlim's ""House of Boys"", ""Beautiful Thing"" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies.",1359244800,2,2929,4.735294117647059

All that is an immense chain of clichs, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clichs if you stick to that and nothing else.

But even if this film is full of such clichs, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clichs to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful.

The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it.

The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants.

The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences.

The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

Only a few decades ago, a number of theories tried to explain the origin of homosexuality. Which is only baffling as one might wonder, why didn't they try to explain heterosexuality? But alas, the heterosexual domain is what constitutes the symbolic order, and thus all other forms of sexuality are bluntly banned or at least discarded.

Freud's followers tried to explain homosexuality in the most contrived ways. For example, the absence of a fatherly figure would dangerously wreak havoc in a child's psyche, thus neutralizing the normal course of the Oedipus complex (since there is no father to rival against for the love of the mother, the whole structure falls apart). This sort of theory could be easily applied to someone like Jamie, who has no father and lives with his strong-willed, almost masculine mother that symbolically castrates her temporary male partners.

But what happens with Ste? His homosexuality cannot be explained by a textbook approach like the one that so easily fits into Jamie's background. Nor does it need to. And this is what should be considered one of the most important things about this movie. You don't need to explain homosexuality any more than you need to explain heterosexuality. One is just as natural and beautiful as the other.

Can gay and straight people coexist? Or there will be constant struggle and friction? Hettie Macdonald's film elicits a possible answer that will only provide the viewer with hope. After all, if an infraction of the Lacanian symbolic order is committed, id est, the homosexual relationship, then it's only logical to deconstruct that symbolic order. Deconstruction does not mean destruction, deconstruction focus in the fissures present in every structure and takes advantage of them in order to rearticulate the symbolic order (society, any given society, is first and foremost a symbolic order, that would constantly readapt and modify depending on the individuals that are part of that society).

Jamie and Ste achieve that task admirably. It's a long way, though, from simple friendship, to the first hazed and rushed sexual exploration, to the difficulty in assuming their roles and true sexuality, to the stable relationship they solidify with time and patience.

Perhaps the fullest, most powerful, affirmation of the deconstruction of the previous symbolic order is the final scene. I won't spoil it to those who haven't seen it yet, suffice to say rather than a ""beautiful thing"" it is a very beautiful moment. Usually I don't like films about hope, as I am rather devoid of such virtue, but I found the end both touching and immensely reaffirming. Sometimes, I guess, it's not to so bad to dream of a world where gays and straight people can, indeed, coexist peacefully.",1320537600,4,2964,5.075975359342916

879868,5,6304410832,"Beautiful Thing (1996)
 A made for TV movie produced by British Channel Four.
 With a loud blowing whistle this film grabs your attention then enfolds you with love. Pigeonholing this as a ""coming of age"" flick is not justified. If anything, the last 15 years has built the movie's reputation as one of the finest in the genre.  This stands out as a clear, tight, well crafted endeavor with a multi layered approach.  Yes, there is sexual awakening, but also the fear of what that sexuality means.  Secondly it deals with the importance of reaching out to peers who are being abused.  On that point alone it deserves our credit.  ""Beautiful Thing"" shows the power that uniting with each other gives.  The power to face challenges, the happiness to live, and the love to enjoy that living.
 Writer Jonathan Harvey and director Hettie Macdonald start with a premise that is depressing as hell, the kind that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  In the hands of lesser talents it would have been easily forgotten.  Together they built an entertainment that is truly a ""Beautiful Thing"", full of hope and caring. Even minor characters are well developed: the pretty as well as the ugly.  At times even the films background music is allowed to become a character.  You might forget the names involved, but the final scene will stay with you for decades!
 Life just existed as three teens living next door to each other in a London housing project.  On one side is Leah (pronounced LEE- ah) (Tameka Empson knocked this part right out of the ball park!). A young black girl, who regularly smokes, drinks and stays out with boys all hours of the night.  She lives with a mother who has given up on her.  In the middle apartment, Jamie (Glen Berry), a teenager, our hero, lives with his single mother Sandra (Linda Henry) and her latest live-in boyfriend Tony, (Ben Daniels) -- an ""artist"" and a bit of a burnout.  Next door Steve (Scott Neal) lives with an abusive older brother who sells drugs, and an equally abusive father -- who is also a drunk.  Reading that set up would make most people pass.  However, just as you wouldn't give up on a gay teen, don't give up on this film.  A rainbow will happen!
 As the characters develop we learn that Leah, kicked out of various schools, indulges in her vices in an attempt to find some kind of change.  Her only real escape is in the almost forgotten music of Mama Cass.  She embraces this as her own way to soar above what is around her.
 As Sandra, Linda Henry is down right dangerous.  Abandoned as a child she was forced to become a tigress.  Fighting to make a living, fighting as a single parent to make a home for her little boy, and fighting to forget the child she lost in childbirth.
 Berry gives the part of Jamie an edgy balance of sprit and venerability. He never knew his father.  Made fun of at school, he avoids sports and hides the fact that he is supposed to wear glasses.  While he resents his mother's boyfriend Tony, his real conflict lies in his feelings for Steve.  He really does care deeply for
 ""the boy next door"", but does not know how to show it.  He feels powerless to help Steve.  Berry does a fantastic job showing the pain he feels just seeing Steve's bruised body.
 Steve only knows that in some way he is different from his older brother and his dad.  He gets beaten up so often he barely tries to fight back anymore. He begins to believe if he were only alone, then he could hide his ugliness, for they have made him ugly.  Neal's quiet portrayal speaks volumes, correctly allowing our imaginations to fill in for unnecessary dialogue.
 Beautiful Thing builds hope while never feeling sorry for itself.  It is this reviewer's belief that you will find the ending fantastic and compelling.  This one will make you smile, cheer, and just maybe, need a hug!",1306800000,4,3827,4.538011695906433

It's essentially the coming of age story both of Jamie and Ste, with their conflictual relationship with their parents, both single parents, and the different approach they have with their sons.",1278288000,3,446,4.658227848101266
880005,5,6304410832,"`Beautiful Thing' is a masterpiece of cinema, deserving of many an accolade. Young Jamie is atypical in his need for direction and identity. Like most boys his age he is desperately trying to find some peace, although his own realisations seem to force him out of the naivety that is youth and into the stark reality of adult experience. His mother being a single mum (Sandra Gangel), played by Linda Henry (an undervalued and often unappreciated actress) battles to both liberate and protect her son from the world she knows to be inherently cruel. The fact that they live amongst a community of individuals each as eccentric as each other, and whom are more involved in the lives of others than their own, makes this task all the more difficult. Jamie's coming-out is at first hidden from his mother, although she having protected him all her life knows there is something that he is hiding from her. When the truth finally comes out, the dialogue between her and her son, is an emotionally uplifting and revealing scene, worthy of one of the cinematic scenes that inspire movies within themselves.

Comic relief is provided by Tameka Empson who is as delightful as she is grass and annoying. You can't help but love her character in all its eccentric madness, as she mimics the community in which she lives. He attitude to Jamie is conflicting at first, as she moves from her own opinions to that of the world around her, until she like Sandra realise that Jamie and his relationship with Ste is truly a `Beautiful Thing'. The pervasive irony however, is that whilst the community is prepared to tolerate domestic violence, drug usage, pervasive decay and poverty, they cannot accept homosexuality. Ultimately, this raw hypocrisy is made self-evident as Sandra, Jamie and Ste find solace, strength and vision in each other.
One of the very best in gay cinema.",1277424000,4,1862,4.836990595611285

I purchased the video tape many years ago and I have watched it several times.  I recently purchased the DVD to make sure I would always have a copy I could watch.  However, for an American audience, the lack of subtitles is a deficiency.  The characters use a great deal of British slang and, to an American, the dialog is often unclear.

The ball comes at the end of the movie instead of the middle, but that's fine.

880101,5,6304410832,"This 1996 entry from the ever-inventive Channel Four Films, puts most (if not all) gay coming-of-age movies to shame. This charmer is the story of Jamie (Glenn Berry) and Steve (Scott Neal), two teens who are not exactly friends; not exactly enemies. Their bond is more their proximity than anything else. That and the fact that they both are beginning to feel that there has to be more to life than the projects of South London. Jamie is the more studious, the more in touch with his emerging sexuality, the one tormented with taunts of ""poof"" and ""queer"". Steve, trapped in his flat with his physically abusive father and brother, is the more ""straight"" and dreams of sports infamy. The boys find themselves drawn together, dealing with the problems of their lives, and ultimately falling in love, falling in fear of love, and finally falling into a measure of comfortability with one another.

The eclectic cast of characters includes Jamie's barmaid mother Sandra (the brilliant Linda Henry), Sandra's oh-so-understanding boyfriend Tony, and teen neighbor Lia (Tameka Empson - a bravura performance in the ""hag"" role) who wants nothing more than to be Mama Cass. The result is a story not so much about two boys coming out, but about a whole community daring to come out of their respective closets and daring to dream. The film utilizes the music of Mama Cass and The Mamas and the Papas almost exclusively, resulting in a soundtrack that -- for a change -- actually serves the needs of the film. Though not the best made film from a technical standpoint, the characters are rich and believable, and if the last scene alone doesn't give you a lump in your throat, well...then you are jaded, aren't you.

880102,4,6304410832,"This did not get rave reviews on its original cinema release and while it did respectable business on the art house circuit never made a major commercial splash .Yet this warm ,tender and unassuming movie has lasted long in the popular affection .It is competently directed and has the strong cast and solid support actors that have always been a feature of UK cinema. Yet its popularity is not solely down to these factors but rather to its generosity of spirit. It is not profound. It is not sophisticated .It is the cinema as comfort food and its world is the world of everyday struggles and quiet triumphs over adversity. It affirms in a positive way gay white working class identity and uses humour to project its message ,rather than employing a furrowed brow and pounding the ""message"" over in broad strokes

It is set in and around a working  class housing estate in London and centres around 2 teens-,Jamie (Glen Barry)and Ste (Scott Neal).It establishes in its opening scene,set on the school playing fields, the contrast between the boys. Jamie hates sports and tries to get out of games .He loves old movies (there is a shot of Lucille Ball on his bedside cabinet)and reads celebrity and gossip magazines. He is most assuredly not ""one of the lads"" and is bullied and labelled as gay. Ste however likes sports and is good at them -when first seen he wears an Arsenal soccer shirt. He fits in and the contrast between the two is reinforced later in a scene where Ste joins in an informal kickabout as Jamie sits disconsolately on the sidelines .Yet we are given non verbal clues that the two boys ,while not bosom pals in school ,get on OK .In both the above scenes Ste gives Jamie a look of sympathy ,a ""sorry about these wankers"" expression on his face.
For Ste ,home is the problem .He and Jamie are both living in single parent homes but they have wildly contrasting experiences of this .Ste is bullied by his alcoholic father and brutal elder brother ,while Jamie is loved firecely and loyally by his mother Sandra -the excellent Linda Henry. She and Jamie spar verbally but the love and support they give each  other is real and unswerving and she is ambitious for a new and better life for them both and wants to run her own pub rather than stay a barmaid
What we get in the movie is a classic romantic narrative but one that just happens to involve two boys as they come to realise,not simply that they are gay ,but are drawn to each other. After one beating too many from his father Ste is taken in by Sandra and invited to ""top and tail"" with Jamie .The scene that follows is among the most tender and affecting in all cinema. I repeat-in all cinema ,not just gay cinema .The scene is not explicit but tender and loving ,fraught with fumbling and hesitancy (just like so many first encounters )and achingly moving. We then see the contrasting impact of the encounter on the two boys -Jamie growing in self confidence and Ste struggling to reconcile his sexuality with his status as ""one of the lads"" and frightened of his Dad and brother finding out .

The major motif of the movie is ""coming out"" and visually the movie is suprisingly subtle. Producer Tony Garnett was a major TV producer and there is a slighly TV feel to the visuals especially the shots of the bleak estate but then the scenes will be brightened up by a rainbow and the attempts by residents to brighten up the area with window baskets etc .This is never just a wallow in social realism and the sense of unreality is quite deliberate at times .
The leading actors are not hunks in the Hollywood sense .They are sweet - cute even- but quite ordinary kids in looks and aspirations ,which makes it an easy movie for gay teens to relate to .Note also the suggestions that Sandra has a  gay side -her closest relationship is not with boyfriend Tony but her work partner Louise .She has the reputation as a sexual predator and comes across as quite butch and with a hint of sexual ambiguity. Her defiance of prejudice in the dance that features in the last scene is overt and more than simply a lioness defending her cubs from prejudice .Add a warm feisty performance from Tamara Empson a troubled teen Leah ,whose Mama Cass fixation is the excuse for some glorious soundtrack music.

This is a celebration of coming out .It is open hearted and charming .I have a deep affection for this movie for while not great cinema it is life and love affirming. And that counts for a whole lot in my book .

Seeek it out since it affirms two groups often derided in cinema -gays and blue collar whites .This is a pleasure",1221004800,8,4596,4.510204081632653

880180,5,6304410832,"Problem is, naysayers to this movie didn't grow up in a situation like that. Obviously, anyone who has an imagination can understand what's going on. This film was way ahead of its time in the fact that they didn't need to show every little bit of what was going on. Now you see that in movies constantly.
I think I have a rather good idea of what a fantastic movie is, and I'm not just saying that about this movie because I am a homosexual. I relate to these characters like I know them. Its almost as if my story was being told on that screen. Of course, Im not from England and it wasn't an apartment complex, but its pretty much the same exact thing.
Jamie and Ste didn't exactly have a close relationship before hooking up, no. But they'd obviously known each other a long time. Nobody noticed how, at school, they might not have been the best of friends, but outside of school they got along just fine. THAT HAPPENS. That's the way high school is. Especially if you're in a rural or condensed area.
The love scene was not, either, ""all of a sudden"", like some paint it out to be. The scenes leading up to it show their growing admiration of each other, especially when they were trying to suss out each others' take on girls and sexuality the first night Ste came to stay at Jamie's. Then came the simple task of Ste retrieving Jamie's soccer ball when the other jerks just threw him in the river. In a film it may not seem like much, but in reality, real life, it means a lot. And RELATION to that is where you understand these characters.
The only problem I had with this movie was with Leah's ""trip"" scene in which she actually though she was someone else. A little far-fetched, yeah. Only people on drugs coinciding with mental problems believe they're someone else. And I had a problem with the DVD having no English subtitles. I had to turn the closed-caption on my TV on. Those big black boxes are distracting. But now I know the movie by heart, so I don't really need them.
I thought this was a fantastic and REALISTIC movie. In order to understand and believe in it, you have to RELATE to it, which I did. I remember going through the exact same motions Jamie went through in his coming out.

Steve (Ste) is in an abusive home, Jamie doesn't fair much better but he is loved. Ste is a jock, Jamie is not.  After being beaten by his brother Ste goes to Jamie's, his mother tells Jamie to let Ste share his bed...how many gay young men get THAT kind of offer (to be fair she doesn't know her son is gay).  The boys have a rapport, Ste looks at Jamie with soulful eyes...is he gay or does he just like Jamie?  The sleeping together platonically continues...  At one point we see the effects of abuses on Ste both physically and mentally...""You're not ugly"" is answered with ""They've made me ugly.""  Things progress, and it is a beautiful thing.  It is not graphic, it is poigniant.  They go to a gay pub together, Jamie's mother follows them... It turns ugly, but not tragic.  Love saves the day...Jamie's mother, despite her hard as nails exterior comes through.  The end scenes...lovely.  The boys dance in public, Ste's hard man extereior melts for Jamie, he knows the reaction of dancing in public but takes his man and holds him close...sigh.  It ends here, but it is implied he will go to live with Jamie and his mother at her new pub, she will be landlady.  Well that is the ending I see.

880184,5,6304410832,"If you have never seen a coming out movie, this is the one to pick. One of the most critically acclaimed gay movies, it is a sensitive, caring, tender, and sweet story with a superb Mama Cass score. The movie has also been acclaimed to be a good representation of the working class in British society.

The movie greatly directed by Hettie McDonald and based on the screenplay of gay writer Jonathan Harvey portrays the relationships of people in a large tenement complex located in East of London (I was physically there). Mostly for low income, working class Britons, the movie revolves around three families, all broken homes. Ste, coming from an abusing father and brother family; Jaime, a mother and a boyfriend family; and Leah, a British Black girl with her mother.

The story is the development of a gay loving relationship between two boys, Ste (played by Scott Neal) and Jaime (played by Glenn Berry). They both live next to each other. They are both 16 (also in real life to maintain accuracy). It is also the story of Leah, sometimes drug user, troubled, dropout teenager. She is a catalyst with her obsession of Mama Cass music, constantly singing her songs and making a lot of noise around the apartments. I have read messages in this movie chat room about her, not understanding why she is the movie. Her character contributes to the greatness of the movie.

Ste is been beaten several times by his father and brother. He takes refuge in Jaime's home. Jaime's mother, Sandra (superbly performed by Linda Henry). She loves Jaime dearly and left her husband because of physical abuse. She is a tough, no-nonsense, caring, and loving woman, who runs the local bar/club in this apartment complex. She feels sorry for Ste and takes him in. Ste has to sleep in Jaime's bed or a couch. Then one thing leads to another, Jaime kissing Ste.

There is a trip to a local gay bar, more kissing in the woods. Sandra finds out that her son has been lying to her about his love for Ste. She is informed by the school principal that Jaime is being teased and called a ""fag."" And the movie comes to it's final moments.

Leah playing Mama Cass music late at night while high and almost falling down from the balcony of the apartment building, and Ste finding out that  Sandra knows about them.

While Sandra has been offered a better job to run a pub in another area of East London, she says goodbye to her boyfriend, and preparing to have night out with the girls. Ste, Jaime, and Leah preparing to go the gay bar again.

The final scenes of the movie show Ste and Jaime dancing (to a tune of Mama Cass music) in an open area of the apartment buildings while tenants are congregating to watch the whole thing, some in an uproar. Sandra comes out to the balcony, next to Leah, watching what was going on below. One of the best scene I have ever  seen in a movie of any kind is the extension of Leah's hand to Sandra (the symbolism is so powerful). By the way, Sandra and Leah fight like cats and dogs throughout the movie, they mend in the final moments. They both joined Ste and Jaime in the dancing, and Sandra finally accepts her son sexuality.

This is a very powerful movie and the title is very appropriate. Both Glenn and Scott have stated on interviews that they received thousands of letters after the film asking if they were gay. Glenn disappeared from the screen and Scott did some minor things. The language is hard to understand sometimes. There are websites with dictionary of the slangs used by the working class in Britain. Someone put a screenplay for a sequel in the Internet, it is rather good. This is a ""GREAT"" movie",1198368000,5,3634,4.542813455657492

An average film dipicting poor, violent and crass British folks and the love between two teenage boys in this enviroment. Has some very touching moments, but overall highly flawed.

880316,5,6304410832,"As a gay man, I have to say the plot of this film takes me back to a time when I first started to find myself and, eventually, came out. ""Some things are just hard to say"", says Jamie (one of the teenagers in the film), effectively coming out to his mother. I remember saying that or something not unlike it at the time.

Jamie and Ste live next door to each other, and when Ste's father and brother have physically abused him (an ongoing problem), Sandra (Jamie's mother) takes him in for the night, whereupon he and Jamie begin their self-discovery.

Perhaps my favourite scene is when Jamie and Ste are running through the woods together when they finally stop to begin a long, passionate kiss. It always brings tears to my eyes because I feel so happy for them, not to mention deliriously envious.

I think the gay theme of this film is mild enough as to not offend too many people if they are already open to viewing a film covering such a topic. However, some of the language is quite crude - the ""C"" word appears a number of times. I've read many American reviewers stating they have trouble with the accent so I suspect British TV and films are not widely shown there (perhaps there is little interest). Being Australian I fortunately have no trouble understanding both accent and colloquialisms.

I've seen plenty of gay films before. Most have not had that great a storyline or lasting feeling to them. Beautiful Thing has genuine effects on the emotions, especially if you can relate to the main characters. It is definitely my favourite film in this genre. I just love it!",1178409600,7,1584,4.5473684210526315

880406,5,6304410832,"""Beautiful Thing"" is, as many other reviewers have described well, a gay teen movie about two boys from one London's many horrible concrete deserts who slowly come to realize their attraction to each other. Though themes similar to this have been done so often it has more or less become a cliche, this particular London variation gives new life to the genre.

The acting is quite well-done, in the traditions of British television programming, and contrary to most American romantic movies (gay or otherwise), not everyone looks like a supermodel, which is a pleasant change. The movie's way of proceeding from one scene to another, each being rather a next step in the telling of the story than an expansion on prior events or characters, gives it a fast tempo. This, combined with the realistic portrayal of the characters involved (even if they are a little flat sometimes) and the unpredictable development of the plot compared with most gay movies, makes it very worth watching.

The soundtrack is uplifting and moody, and fits the movie's atmosphere perfectly. When the final scene comes round, any viewer (hopefully even straight ones) will feel melancholy, but satisfied, as it should be.",1168041600,9,1197,5.040404040404041

880408,5,6304410832,"This tender & thoughtful movie is a revelation. It simply states that love takes all kinds of forms, even in the most turbulent conditions. As the film progresses, we see one (Jamie) embrace that love while the other (Ste) tries it, then rejects it for a ""normal life"", then clings to it in light of a violent & disturbing home life at the hands of an uncaring father & angry older brother. For any gay teen, Jamie & Ste are idyllic role models. Jamie's Mum, Sandra, is a tough-looking woman, hardened by everyday survival---but there's no question she loves her son more than life. There's also much-needed amusing supporting turns from Tony (Sandra's well-intended but stumbling boyfriend) and Leah, the trouble-making girl who has nothing more to do in her life but idolize Mama Cass (whose songs give the film its distinct flavor).

The boys' secret flight to the Gloucester (gay bar) and subsequent kiss in the woods are wonderful moments. Sandra's ""coming out"" talks with both Jamie & Ste give her character depth, and are extremely touching & real. And that climactic slow dance between Jamie & Ste before stunned neighbors & strangers is the ultimate declaration of love & pride: We're in love, and we don't care who accepts or rejects it---it just IS.

This is an uplifting & hopeful film. It proves that even in the harshest moments of adversity, love--even between two boys--can triumph.",1165968000,6,1398,4.869747899159663

In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to ""GET REAL"". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast.

880412,2,6304410832,"I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not. You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie. With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.

The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from ""a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building"" to ""hot and heavy can't live without each other love""?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be. The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything. In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene. I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.

Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it. So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy. If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship. Look somewhere else.

880559,5,6304410832,"Movies, plays, and books are all subjective endeavors. The idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece.  In the case of BEAUTIFUL THING, that is not hard  to do.

From the opening frame you want Jamey to thrive. He hates PE because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer (the English call it football). He jumps the fence and heads home skipping PE for the umpteenth time. Who can blame him and when a school chum's, Ste's, homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn, Jamey's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship.

As the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other, the music of Mama Cass Elliott plays in the background. The story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple.  You know they are young but not too young.  You wish that had happened to you when you were their age.

Earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story, so I won't go into that here.  Instead, I want you to see the DVD so you can experience the feeling I felt at the end of the movie when Jamey and Ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors.  Unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood, I chose to suspend my disbelief and each time I watch it, I mouth the word ""yes"".",1146096000,29,1507,4.296819787985866

It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah  deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas & Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film.",1142121600,13,806,4.558620689655172

The two young actors, Glenn Berry and Scott Neal in the lead roles are simply stunning, funny and heartbreaking too. Linda Henry as the Mother to one of the young men gives a raw whirlwind powerhouse performance!  Why are so many magnificent performances in small films forgotten at awards time?

I believe that the movie is awsome and the acting is very clean. There is no sheeps or mountain in here but there is an unusual teen love that involves two kids into what we can call 'a love story' In between drugs, motherhood and disfunctional families on a condoe this movie relates everything perfectly.

Mamma Cass music make the extra point to it. Not in a bad taste as another films they include techno songs or dance music. Here is all about love and music. The relationships in the whole films are unexplicable marked. Though it wasn't very successful the movie is a very big attention to those who think gay are disastrous men. Jamie and Ste relationship is very delightful. How they become friends and how the love fights over all kind of crisis is remarkable. No bad feelings in between the mother and Jamie but you can feel a very tense relationship into this family.

Leah's character is basicly a break-point plus to the whole movie sequence. And what about the endin'. It's beautiful. A total masterpiece. I can say that this movie will touch many people and those who feel intimidated will say it's pure crap.",1140134400,4,1277,4.547826086956522
880565,5,6304410832,"This movie is really quite nice and innocent.  I honestly do not understand the R rating either.  I suspect this movie gets an R for no other reason than its main theme is GAY related. Heaven forbid some otherwise straight person see a tender caring movie showing homosexual life where the gay characters are not psychopaths, street hustlers or low life criminals on the fast trck to some stereotypical tragic deadly downfall.

This movie is about two dudes who find each other and the pains they both have in coming out to themselves then their families and eventually the world around them.  This movie is a Beautiful Thing indeed.  As for the slang being difficult to understand that is a valid point but even a novice can get the point of what is meant.  I am not the quickest off the mark when it comes to understanding brit-slang but even I managed to comprehend the movies meanings well enough in time to keep up with what was going on.  You are definately ahead of the learning curve on the slang in this movie if you are a fan of East Enders or any other brit-coms or mysteries featured mainly on the BBC America or PBS channels,

The A Beautiful Thing is sweet, gentle, tender and sensitive. Character development is amazingly subtle especially in a gay themed movie where so many directors make the mistake to protraying everything as over the top camp or trashy.  A Beautiful Thing evokes memories making it uniquely powerful in its understated message of love in a world of intollerance and homophobia.  Most of all that A Beautiful Thing has a rare thing indeed for a gay movie, a happy ending making it one to buy and add to my collection because so very few gay themed movies have happy endings.

It was so nice to see a gay themed movie where the guys are not street wise thug hustlers.  These guys were not your typical perfect gym bodied empty headed primping self absorbed muscle boy egoist.  These dudes were just your normal everyday run of the mill British Blokes who found each other and fell in love.  There is effectively no overt sex or hard core violence in this movie to speak of so A Beautiful Thing would be great for someone dealing with coming out issues.  I liked that the situations in this movie felt a little more real, less odd, forced and staged than I see in most USA made gay themed gay coming of age movies.

All I can say is I wish they had movies like this one when I was young but I am thankful movies like A Beautiful Thing exists for those gay folk coming to terms with being gay today.  I enjoyed Beautiful Thing on Satilite TV and on seeing it will buy a copy from AMAZON.com so I cab add A Beautiful Thing to my collection soon and hope you will as well.

I taped the next showing, keeping it long enough, and finally decided some months back to make the purchase on DVD--I would urge you to do the same. What can I possibly say that hasn't been? This is simply a sweet film. The tale of two boys falling in love is done wonderfully here, presenting a believable pairing of two wanting souls that finally find love in each other. I can say all of the actors do a superb job realizing their characters in various emotional states. (On a side note, the British accents used in the film can be a bit thick for us Yanks, but it can be fixed by using your television's Closed Captioning, since the DVD is rather bare bones.) I do wish, though, that some of the cliches found in films like this were not present, such as the required drag queen (they frighten me as clowns do to others). There is also some corny, light stuff; however, the shortcomings I found were tolerable given much of the film is so well worth it and filled with some really tender and sweet moments. There is one scene in particular that consistantly melts my heart upon every viewing. It's a scene where the lead boys, Jaime and Ste, are playfully running around the park at night to the tune of the Mama Cass song ""Make Your Own Kind Of Music."" The two stop at a tree and kiss so sweetly and joyfully that it brings tears to my eyes, always with a smile, almost every time I watch it (the first couple of times I saw the scene I most certainly did bawl). I really wish more same-sex kisses between guys in films were done with the sweetness as the ones found here between Jaime and Ste. So many of the kisses I've seen seem...distant and rather disrespectful--not here. This is truly a love story for anyone with an open mind...and an open heart.",1128470400,16,1867,4.367816091954023

What is so remarkable is being able to watch (and FEEL) the love that grows between these two young men as the movie progresses.  At the beginning of the movie, Jamie has an outward appearance of a ""tough guy"" who routinely has mild run-ins with his mother over things like skipping school.  Pay particular attention to the way he interrogates Tony...there's no question that he's learned from his mother to take control of most situations.  However, from the moment Ste starts sleeping over, Jamie just seems to ""melt"" in Ste's presence.  All of a sudden, we see a young man mellowed by his love of Ste.  Ste takes a bit longer to fall into the same pattern, but nonetheless, by the time the movie ends, we see two young men who, in spite of tough circumstances at home, at school, and in general, find that true love overcomes any and all hurdles placed in the way.  Beautiful Thing is easily the best love story put on the screen in a long time.  It's honest without being overly ""syrupy"".  Add to it the incredible soundtrack, featuring the music of Cass Elliot, and you have a movie that's easy to watch over and over...and never gets old!",1117324800,5,1323,4.497907949790795
880709,5,6304410832,"BEAUTIFUL THING may be almost ten years old but the simplicity and honesty of the approach of a gay coming-out film is still hard to match.  Director Hettie MacDonald has gathered a group of actors so fresh and real that the story seems more like eavesdropping than a movie.

Jamie (Glen Barrie) lives with his mum Sandra (Linda Henry), a blowsy, tacky, loud but heart of gold waitress, in a housing project.  Jamie plays soccer and does all the right things -  except he is a closeted gay lad who is forced to come to grips with that fact.  He falls in love with Ste (Scott Neal) who lives next door to Jamie's flat and is regularly beaten by his father and brother.  How these two come together and eventually move into the world more acquainted with their sexuality and its complexities forms the storyline.

The actors are all superb, including Sandra's boyfriend du jour Tony (Ben Daniels) and the hilarious Leah (Tameka Empson). But the performance by Linda Henry is a stand out:  she finds the love in this brazen woman and allows it to surface.  Likewise Glen Barrie's Jamie is wholly and palpably believeable.

If there is a fault with this film it is in the dialect of this London suburb:  turn on the English subtitles so that you can understand what is being said!  Grady Harp, January 2005",1107043200,3,1302,4.588744588744588

880821,5,6304410832,"This has to be my favorite movie of this type of theme. Two teenage boys, at first seeming like aquaintances and then friends, become lovers after one of them is abused by his father and brother and seeks refuge in the other boys home. While mother and boyfriend watch ""The Sound of Music"" in the adjacent room, the two young lads make love to each other. There is no sexual graphic context, just an implication of it as one of the boys gets out of bed, naked. This is genuinely moving love story because it deals with several issues. The single mother must choose between a covetted career and a stoner boyfriend who befriends her son. When the young couples secret is discovered, the drama becomes a little intense but it seems like the true power of family shines through. This is a wonderful movie because this is not a ""stereotypical"" film. HIV isn't really brought up and that makes more room to explore the love and friendships that begin to bloom. And... the final scene alone makes this one of the best romantic movies of all time. Beautiful Thing is as beautiful as its title so aptly suggests and it may take a while for another movie of this callibre to come along.",1104192000,7,1177,4.5046728971962615
880822,5,6304410832,"""Beautiful Thing"", starring Linda Henry (Jamie's mom) and Glen Berry (Jamie), is a great gay themed drama for many to enjoy.  It was released in 1996 and filmed in the UK.  Its theme of two teenage next door neighbors who fall in love takes a further creative turn.  The various plot details give this film further viewing depth, especially the numerous Mama Cass references, the mother struggling day by day, and Jamie's lover Ste's (Scott Neal) daily struggles.  Therefore, this film is more than just a gay film.  The expressed issues to its level offer the realistic education of everyday living, especially as a gay teen.  Though, it also explores self-destruction, alcoholism, domestic abuse, and others.

Beyond this brilliant plot is potential acting from the cast, especially Henry.  Her character's everyday living and emotional pain is wonderfully expressed.  Her performance offers the highest emotional value of the film.  Berry and Neal prove in their powerful performances that they have great potential for acting growth in the future.  Both have various scenes that prove their true acting talents.

""Beautiful Thing"" is a great film recommended for more than just gay teens.  A variety of audiences will surely enjoy this.  Those wanting more gay teen themed issues should also watch ""Get Real"" (1999).  Such combination makes great entertainment pleasure.",1103328000,12,1374,5.267281105990784

880825,5,6304410832,"I can't count the number of times I've read a magazine article about this movie, how many times I'd scoured the movie rental places for it in high school, how many times I'd almost bought it online... but never did get my hands on it until recently. It may be hard to find, but it is well worth the search. This is the best coming-of-age movie I've seen --I connected with it and each of the characters on more than one level-- and I was delighted to find that the usual stereotypes are no where to be found in this movie. And on top of that, no sex scenes or anything else you might not want to show your mother.
The story has been summarized in many of the other 250 or so reviews, so I won't do that here. But I will urge you to get this movie and watch it -- it will touch you and be beneficial whether you are just coming to terms with being gay, if you're out and completely fine with yourself, or if your kid or friend has just come out to you. Even if you don't know many gay people, watch this movie and see what you think. It deserves all the awards, recognition, and reputation that is has. I only wish I had seen it sooner (and that other people had seen this before I had to come out to them!).
This is a British film, so expect more rough language than you'd see if it had been made in the U.S... I'd also recommend using the Closed Caption to keep from getting a bit confused from the language differences (for instance, I thought Ste had said he was Naked when it made no sense ... ends up he had said Knackered... sleepy I guess LOL).
Whether you rent it or buy it, find some way to see this movie.",1085184000,16,1615,4.065830721003135
880826,5,6304410832,"I wish they had had this film and play when I was younger.  The story of Jamie, his family, his love and his difference is very powerful.  The central character Jamie is in the process of coming out, and has an infatuation that deepens into love with his nextdoor neighbor and friend Ste.  Jamie's life is a bit of a shambles given his mother (a single mother) who has a flighty but sincere boyfriend.  Jamie's mother only wants the best for him, which is a far cry from Ste's family, headed by a single father, which also includes an abusive brother.
The dynamics of life in the government housing unit (called council housing there) is interesting, as all people have hopes but lowered expectations about what life can bring them; this is very much a teenager angst movie, and even the adults seem to be into it.
Jamie's mother should be a member of PFLAG, being at first shocked, but then very supportive.  Ste's father and brother fall into line with the typical homophobic types.  The rest of the world seems blissfully unaware of the major life events taking place, which in reality makes this film very realistic.
This is not a deep film, but it isn't really superficial either.  It is honest and sincere in expressing the emotions and situations of the characters without making them cartoon cut-outs or political objects.  But in the end, the message is political of a sort, and that is that we all have the freedom to run our own lives, including who we love.

During one of Ste's cruel treatments he seeks shelter with his neighbor Jamie and this becomes the beginning of a friendship, which later turns into affectionate love.  However, the common notion among those who surround them is against their secret love which challenges them emotionally as they fear aftermath of their love.  Beautiful Thing is a wonderful love story that grows within the dead concrete buildings and powerful oppression of the social environment of the two young men.

It was also the first gay film that I have seen in years that is not full of self-loathing, tragic characters. Don't get me wrong these characters still have their share of problems, but they are not jaded and this is not about ""the scene"". It is much more about being true to yourself and just loving in spite of problems. I really loved it. I am buying it right now!",1068681600,12,727,4.163120567375887
881027,5,6304410832,"Sit down strap yourself in and hold on as we are about to go on an emotional roller coaster ride to the core of human emotions. ""Beautiful Thing"" is all this, and more; you will laugh, and cry, get angry, and then cry some more. As I started to explain this film, which will grab you and pull you in quite possibly like no other, to my employee, I started to break down; I don't do this very often. Tears are welling up now as I type this.

The film is about an adolesent young man, Jamie who lives with his ""mum"" in an English housing development along with is neighbores on one side, Leah ( who adds much comic relief ) and her mother, and Ste. ( short for Steven )another adolesent boy of the same age and his older brother and father on the other side.
In the openning secequence, Jamie is in his P.E. class ( with Ste.) and the other boys ridicule him viciously, not wanting him to join them in football ( British style ); humiliated ( I've been then there) after having his gym kit thrown over the fence he retrieves it, skips class and runs home. Ste., on the other hand is physicaly beaten by his abusive bother and father and lives in fear; unable to take the abuse any longer Ste. spends the night with Jamie sleeping head to toe in the same bed. Later on Jamie steals a gay magazine shows it to Ste. and discovers a gay ""pub"" across town and ask's him to join him; the mother knows something is up and follows them there, when later that night she confronts Jamie on his activies of that night, crying in his bed ""Some things are just to hard to say"" he tells his mother. Like a trailer to a film, I don't like to give the whole story away and ruin it for you; I really suggest that you avoid reading other reviews that do. I will say there isn't any frontal nudity; and it's a great film if you are just comming out or show it to your family or school  to dramitize the effects of gay bashing etc. either way, bring plenty of kleenx the ending will stick with you for a long time; for it is neither to sweet to be ""sappy"" and the acting is excellent to the point of being surreal; This could have been a major motion picture Hollywood style, I have never seen anything like it and the soundtrack form the ""MOMMA'S & THE PAPPA'S adds a wonderful score.
 We as gay people have face and experienced rejection, hatred, bigotry and even murder; but in the end you will discover that life after all is, a Beautiful Thing.

881029,5,6304410832,"There are only a handful of really, truly feel-good gay movies out there at the moment, and this gem of a film from 1996 endures as one of the best of them.
A simple story: two boys coming to terms with their sexuality in their teenage years, one more comfortable than the other but both strong and complex in their own ways.  Subtle yet fulfilling sub-plots focusing on the neighborhood and families are rare in that they actually fill out the story rather than distract from it.
If I had to summarize the moral of the story, it's would be that it is about personal will to find happiness despite the seemingly larger-than-life obstacles that can and will get in your way.  A truly touching film and one definitely worthy of the permanent collection.
Note, though, that though this DVD is many years later than the VHS release, it's a very bare-bones DVD - pretty much just the movie.  The movie itself is worth it though - you won't regret the purchase, and will probably have to lend it out to a number of friends. :)",1060473600,2,1020,4.473118279569892

The love blossoming in the most unlikely of locations does not depend on eye-candy shots of high school hunks in swimsuits, like most ""young love"" movies (e.g., ""Nico and Dani,"" ""Get Real,"" ""Come Undone""), but is driven by believable characters leading believable lives. They actually refer to themselves as gay and acknowledge the existence of a gay culture, again a rarity in movies of this type.

881032,5,6304410832,"If you have a good ear and mind for decoding British working class accents (I don't), or a high tolerance for misunderstanding every fifth or sixth phrase (I have), you'll enjoy this film about several families from an apartment complex somewhere in contemporary industrial England. Living in a row like unlikely peas in a pod are teenage youth Jamie and his single barmaid mum, Ste (Jamie's chum) and Ste's single (alcoholic and physically abusive) father and older brother, and an elderly Caribbean woman and her granddaughter Lea, a sassy high school drop-out(?) with a passion for Mama Cass records. (By the way, Mama Cass delivers the only fully intelligble lines in the entire movie.)
It is not an easy life for any of the young people--or the adults, for that matter--in this story. Lea is self-deluded and about as lost as any young girl can be. Jamie is relentlessly teased for being ""bent"" and ""a fluff"" at school, a torment he is too ashamed of to report to his mother. Neighbor Ste is brutally beaten by his father and brother for the slightest infractions. The most touching scene in the movie for me was when Ste first shows Jamie his bruises and Jamie offers to rub his back with a soothing cream, the kind sold to self-pampering housewives in The Body Shoppe. In Jamie's hands, the cream takes on the importance of a sacred unction, a balm of Gilead.
It is apparent throughout this movie that skin to skin contact-- touch--is the most primal way people communicate, establish trust, and form opinions about themselves. ""You're all right,"" Jamie's mother assures him shortly after relentlessly pummeling him during a fit of frustration. One wonders whether such words of assurance can ever undo the messages communicated by direct physical violence. In Jamie's case, perhaps. His mother's efforts to stand by her son are consistent and sincere (bouts of frustration and parental ineptitude aside). In Ste's case, it is only through the gentle, loving contact he receives from Jamie (and Jamie's mother) that he can even begin to realize that he counts for something.
Amidst all this violence and pain is the omnipresent voice of Mama Cass blasting from Lea's hi-fi. This can be heard as the ""la-di-da"" voice of denial, a voice emanating from the far away world of sunshine and flowers (California) and the long-ago time of the Summer of [Innocence and] Love (1967). Or it can be heard as the hymns and creeds of a new religion, one whose chief doctrine is the power of love to conquer hate, violence, and intolerance.
The film has a few loose ends that left me puzzled, but overall I'd call this a great film. I highly recommend it.",1057276800,8,2647,4.8197802197802195

881158,5,6304410832,"Like most romantic movies, Beautiful Thing, is first and foremost a fairy tale?but one that's not afraid to take a closer look at the challenges of adolescent gay love. The story centers on Jamie, an awkward teen with a crush on Ste, his popular classmate who lives next door. Jamie lives with his mother, barmaid Sandra, in a public housing block in a South London working-class neighborhood. He constantly faces teasing at school for his lack of athletic ability and for just generally not fitting in. Things are far from perfect for Ste, however. He is abused by his alcoholic father and drug-dealing brother.
The two boys are thrown together when Ste is kicked out of his apartment one night and Sandra finds him alone and crying. She insists he stay with Jamie and the two boys share a bed, stirring feelings that Jamie has been trying hard to ignore. Nothing happens the first night, but when the scene is repeated a few nights later, Jamie can no longer hold back his feelings. Much to his delight, Ste returns his affection and the boys clumsily stumble into a relationship. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, the path to true love never did run smooth, and the boys still have many challenges to face.
Released in 1996 and filmed for British television, the movie boasts strong acting from its two male leads. Glen Berry as Jamie and Scott Neal as Ste both bring a real sense of confusion and pain to their roles. Strong supporting turns by Linda Henry as Sandra and Tameka Empson as Leah, Ste and Jamie?s loopy neighbor obsessed with Mama Cass, round out a wonderful cast. The script, though filled with British slang that some Americans might find somewhat confusing, is sharp and witty. It has some of my favorite movie lines of all time. I?ve seen the movie so many times I can quote it right along with the actors. The movie also has one of the best coming out scenes I?ve ever seen.
The movie is set to a soundtrack of songs by Mama Cass Elliott. The songs are surprisingly fitting and often seem as if they were written with this movie in mind.

It is not all doom and gloom for our couple though, there is some comic relief as well as the requisite gay ""sarcasm.""  The end will leave you breathless.

It is a story about a boy named Jamie, who is picked on and ridiculed by his peers.  He begins to skip soccer, and his mother notices that he is not himself.  While she is trying to figure out what is going on in his world, a boy next door has his own story.
Ste is a child in a single parent household. His father is a drunk and very abusive to him both verbally and physically.  Ste winds up staying the night with Jamie, to get out of the house.  Again, Sandra-Jamie's mother plays a role.  She encourages Ste to get out of the house, and stay with them, essentially fostering the budding romance between Jamie and Ste.
As the story unfolds, Ste learns to trust, and Jamie learns to love, and the additional emotional support from Sandra makes the story very touching- who doesn't want a hug from their Mom when they come out?
And no good gay movie is worth its salt if there isn't the diva star best friend, in this movie it is Leah- another next door neighbor.  She is a high school drop out who is obsessed beyond comprehention with Mama Cass.  In fact, most of the movie's soundtrack consists of Mama Cass songs, a few even sung by Leah.  Most of the time she isn't sober, but when she is, she adds true insight into the meaning of friendship.  She's also a good comic relief.
The movie has an ""R"" rating, but mostly for strong language.  The love in this movie is so tender-explicit scenes are not necessary to convey the message.
I really recommend this movie!  Its a great excuse to have a ""Movie Night"" date!",1023667200,5,1727,4.2607361963190185

Still now,  this movie, in mine eyes, is the number one gay movie! Leah (Tameka Empson) gives the movie a blast of taste that leaves you laughing.  The relationship that Jamie (Glen Berry) and Ste (Scott Neal) has is so innocent and pure love. ""Just Refreshing""!

881327,3,6304410832,"This movie was very nice.  It was often slow...and the main character's (Jaime) family are the only characters that are developed.  The only problem is that they are the normal ones.  His friend Ste is commonly bruised and is taken in by Jaime's mom for a night.  We know why...but we don't know anything about the people involved.  The homosexual relationship seems a bit contrived as well...even though they are neighbors, we see no foreshadowing interest in each other from either Jaime or Ste.  It is Jaime's mom that suggests the sleep over which is supposed to be how the whole thing gets started...
Overall, the movie was very nice...It remains a good movie on its merits...

I strongly recommend that for those who really want this movie on DVD to wait for the release of either a domestic (US) version, or a non-subtitled European import.

The very British, very urban language is often hard to understand. That said, this is one of the nicest, sweet-natured films I've seen in years. Though the coming-out gay theme is the centerpiece of this film, there are so many other life-styles being portrayed that are all somehow a part of that central theme. It's very clear that the basic idea is ""Live and let live""...a mother's love is unconditional; misunderstood people (Leah) are often loud and brash and cruel, looking for attention; love can be anywhere, waiting to happen, even in the working-class urban jungle. I would've liked English subtitles to understand some of the wonderful but stylized dialogue. I liked the 1.85:1 LBX, and, I must admit, subtitles have never bothered me...though a previous reviewer mentioned that they are larger than life, which is correct. Mama Cass' music is SO appropriate, especially the scene of Jamie and Ste running thru the park to Cass' ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"".

One boy who knows he's gay and isn't quite comfortable with it reveals to his best friend his secret (which includes that he is mad about his best friend, in a more than just friendly way).  This isn't too far off from many other film's subject matter.  However, this is a British film, so you can expect a much richer fabric than with any American film...
Living in what appears to my American eye, to be a middle low income apartment house, both boys are neighbors.  One is abused by his father and brother, the other treated as an equal by his hip, but hapless mother and her boyfriend.  Living down the hall is a too cool for words black girl who wants to be Mama Cass.  Why all the subtext and character development?

Linda Henry is probably the most beautiful thing in the movie. Her character is a role reversal with her boyfriend (i.e. male vs. female) and her performance leaves one breathless. Linda Henry belongs to that pantheon of award-neglected performers that includes the likes of Nichole Kidman in ""To Die For"" and the mother in ""Muriel's Wedding.""

The story centers around Jamie (Berry) and Ste (Neal), 2 teenage classmates and neighbors in a working-class development in London. Jamie is a reserved teen sharing a normal relationship with his single, pub manager Mom (Henry). Ste lives an emotionally and physically abused life at the hands of his single father and older brother. What transpires between them is a very tender and emotional tale of first love and budding homosexuality. Awakening sexual desire, guilt, fear and, eventually, love is played out in an honest & sincere fashion.
The entire cast is superb. As Jamie & Ste, Glen Berry & Scott Neal give their characters a sweet and emotionally accurate innocence... especially when joyously galavanting through a forest together and sharing a long kiss. Linda Henry is exquisite as Jamie's Mom, Sandra. She delivers a fantastic and multi-layered performance as a woman trying to deal with her own life, in addition to her son. As the Mamas & the Papas loving neighbor Leah, Tameka Empson graciously adds some needed turbulence (comically and otherwise).

881580,5,6304410832,"As a gay teen myself, I had a bit of trouble finding an opportuniyu to watch this movie without my parents finding out.  I ended up watching it alone in my basement with sound turned low and one ear open for the door leading down the stairs.  And despite the cold hands and nerve racking tension, it was absolutely worth it.  The movie follows the life of a young gay teen Jaime who live in an apartment complex with his single mother.  His neighbor Steve (nicknamed Ste) is Jaime's romantic interest.  Ste is a victim of domestic violence from both his older brother and drunkard father.  The plot of the movie centers around the relationship that develops between Ste and Jaime, and the exploration of their sexualities.
  The story is told with brilliant realism, and each character has a palpable feel and aura. Each character's actions are realistic and believable.  Jaime's mother very obviously cares deeply for her son, and their relationship is believable as well.  The soundtrack is superb as well; the tone and words of each song fit beautifully with each scene.  This does not mean that the movie is without flaws.  There are few confusing loose ends (Ste's involvement with drugs, Jaime's mother's boyfriend) that feel incomplete.  The British dialogue and slang can be difficult to understand, and the film as a whole may be a tad on the optimistic side.  However, a closer, more careful viewing may make some of these clear.  And the fact that I am willing to sneak another viewing of this film despite the anxiety that goes along with it should speak volumes for the film.  This movie was extremely uplifting.  When I finished it, I felt like I was walking on air.

881581,5,6304410832,"This is truly an incredible movie.  Whether you are gay or straight (you won't enjoy it if you are a homophobe, and I feel sorry for you) you will want to see this movie.
I can't think of a more beautiful love story.  The whole concept of a boy who is being abused by his dad and brother who finds love with another boy...Wow!
Well, I can also add that there is the stellar performance of Jamie's mother.  She is a strong woman who has taken her lumps (quite literally), who now has to deal with what is many parents worst nightmare - a gay son.  If for no other reason, you need to see her reaction and ultimate decision.
This movie is very british, and I suggest that you get somewhat familiar with british slang before you watch it because a lot of the humor will be lost on you if you don't understand the terminology.  And for Americans (I am one) please, PLEASE watch this movie at least twice.  You will find yourself picking up on dialogue that truly is hilarious and very aesthetic the second time around.
All in all, if you can stand a gay love scene (not sex, but a couple of 'hot' kisses), this is a must-see.  I for one appreciated the respect and tenderness that the (to many of us)  taboo relationship was treated.  I can say for this movie at least, it is not about lust, but about love.

The experience of first love by Jamie and Ste, realistically and convincingly portrayed by Scott Neal and Glenn Berry, is innocent and sweet.  I especially enjoyed the performance of Tameka Empson as Leah, Jamie and Ste's neighbor, who is completely infatuated and possessed with the music and persona of Cass Elliott.  By the way, Cass Elliott's music is timeless and is a fantastic addition to the film.  A bit of trivia: The director, Hettie Macdonald, said the she was inspired by the Australian film, ""Muriel's Wedding"" (another one of my favorite films), because of the films great balance of comedy and drama and clever use of music.

It was set in London, dealt with a working class  family speaking accents I wouldnt understand....hardly something I could  relate to. I couldn't have been more wrong. The story revolves around the  budding romance between two young boys...but there's more than one story  here. One kid's mother is struggling to raise him alone without sacrificing  her freedom. The other kid's father and brother have him locked in a  physically abusive relationship. Finally, the backdrop is the working class  community of London, with its inherent struggles to make ends meet. The two  actresses Linda Henry and Tamika Hempson steal the show however. Henry  plays the mother of one of the boys, a dedicated mother who wants to bring  her sun up properly without losing too much of her freedom. A bit of a man  eater, she's a woman consumed by the fear that some would find her unfit,  mainly because she knows she's not giving motherhood her full effort.  Hempson is a Mama Cass fanatic, and her lines are perhaps some of the  funniest in the movie. The funniest scene ironically is one of the only  tense ones in the film, when Hempson's character believes herself to be  Cass while on a heavy drug trip. To top it all off, the ending is  priceless, if a bit unrealistic. Here's hoping we see more like this, and  particlarly more of Henry and Hempson.",963878400,3,1509,4.651515151515151

The movie centers around 2 high school age boys (Glen Barry as  ""Jamie"" and Scott Neal as ""Ste"") coming to terms with  their sexuality. Very tastefully done, this is not a sexual romp by any  means.  The movie emphasizes the pain of coming out as youth, the  struggles and the successes. Slow moving at the start, the story follows  the two boys living in broken dysfuntional families to their coming to  terms of their desire for one another.  Strong performances by most in the  film, including the mother and several others.  The music is also fun with  much of it in memory of the great Mama Cass.

Maybe because I too fell in love at a very early age and  have been with the same person since.  We'll be celebrating our 26th  anniversary in a couple of months.  ""Beautiful Thing"" shows that  not all gays engage in casual sex, some of us enjoy a long and loving  relationship like the straights.

This is, however, completely by the by, as the impact that  the film and the characters seem to have on the lives of people is  genuinely astonishing. That a made-for-TV film should have such a lasting  impact, which seems to be growing rather than diminishing as time goes by,  attests to its greatness.

It has given hope to the hopeless and has  brought poetry and music back into the lives of people who had abandoned  hope of ever finding love again.

881937,5,6304410832,"This is a film for anyone who has ever been in love for the first time.
This sweet-natured story of young love has struck a responsive chord world-wide.  A huge hit in its native country, the film has garnered  a large international audience on video and has been a bit of a phenomenon  on the Internet, inspiring several websites dedicated to it.
The story is  set in the working class Thamesmead area of London.  Sandra Gangell is a  single mother juggling raising her son, Jamie, working as a barmaid and  having a relationship with a younger lover, Tony.  Jamie is a sensitive  adolescent, a bit of a loner, alienated from his more macho contemporaries.  The Gangell's neighbors include Jamie's schoolmate, the athletic, handsome  Ste and his abusive father and brother, as well as Leah, who worships Mama  Cass Elliott and has a reputation as a bit of a tart.
The catalyst in the  story is the blooming of first love between Jamie and Ste.  There haven't  been many films dealing with gay adolescents in the past and this one is a  godsend.  It is handled with simplicity and a certain degree of honesty,  although it does paint an idealistic picture of society's reaction to gay  relationships.
Although Jamie and Ste (Glen Berry and Scott Neal) are the  instigators of the conflict in this comedy-drama, it is the supporting  characters who truly provide the flavor of the film.  Sandra, as played by  Linda Henry, is a coarse, fun-loving woman who is nonetheless loving and  fiercely protective of her only son.  Tony (Ben Daniels) is a hippie  wannabe who loves Sandra and finds himself a bit out of his element.  And  then there is Tameka Empson as Leah, a sassy teenager whose devotion to  Cass Elliott (played at full volume) is driving her mother and the  neighbors to distraction.
The cast is uniformly fine, with Henry and  Empson standouts.  The score, made up mostly of Mamas and Papas songs, is  wonderfully upbeat.",947376000,8,1933,4.760606060606061

Linda Henry should have won an Oscar  for her living, breathing portrayal as the comically fierce and yet tender  mom.

I was also depressed because the storyline is not a reality  for me at this point but with such a fairytale storyline I doubt that many  people are as lucky.  It is refreshing to see a love story where a gay teen  couple are the central characters and not comic relief or the damsel in  distress's best friend.  I recommend this film to anyone.  I watched it  with my mother because I feel that this film really gives my walk of life a  clean and wholesome image.  Don't we all want to meet our soulmate?,941587200,3,670,4.188976377952756

It is a very touching, very truthful, and extemely well written movie; not to mention  the best love story my tired heart has seen.  How does one go about  exchanging one's life for that of a movie characters? I would exchange my  life for that of Jaime's any day. He has his ups and downs (don't we all),  but he has a caring mom (a wonderful character!), and he gets that one  thing that we all look for and don't always find; love.  A very  emotional--and more importantly: emotionally true--movie about coming out  and falling in love (not necissarily in that order).  Until this movie  I had never heard or heard of Mama Cass, but I now intend to buy at least  one album of hers (this soundtrack if such a soundtrack exists.)
  I  highly recomend Beautiful Thing, because it truly is what it's title  implies.",940809600,2,939,4.372093023255814

Perhaps so,and that is  not necessarily a bad thing but i just enjoyed it for the freshness and  originality of the plot and the wonderful chemistry between its two main  co-stars,who by the way are straight. The mother was one mother of a  mother,...and I say that admiringly. With that energy she should be running  a country not a pub. What ever the critics say I thought all the characters  were great. I just hope the actors themselves go on to even better  things.

This moving tale of two young guys falling in love and lust, accented by the highly addictive tunes of Mama Cass (especially  'Dream a little Dream of Me') is one that you have to see. The naiivette of  the two young actors comes through beautifully as realistic teen attitudes,  and their lack of bias is refreshing to say the least. A wonderful film  that shouldn't have an R rating, great to show to people to prove that  there *is* such a thing as gay love.

There are and will  be other movies with similar plot lines and characters, but REST ASSURED,  it will NOT top Beautiful thing! NO other movie has or ever will want to  make me buy any scrap of merchandise available. I have the tape and  screenplay, and DEFINITELY will buy the DVD when it becomes available.

It's the first and only time that a film has captured that indesribable feeling of first love. Coupled with the working-class setting, Jonathan Harvey's tale is absolutely beautiful. Towards the end of the film is a scene not in the original play. After the boys have discovered each other, they are finally free to be with each other alone in the woods - it's the now-famous ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" scene.

I also  should mention the humour in it as well. Very funny momments and lines in  at as well. The soundtrack with Mama Cass and The Moma's & The Popa's  is excellent as well, and is a must have, just like the video.

Well, at the end of this movie all I wanted to do was watch it  again.  I wanted to tell the whole world about this movie.  Different  people receive different messages from movies with social impact, but no  one could watch this movie and not have an uderstanding what life is like  for us.  I watched this movie and realized that not everyone out there  hates gays.  I realied that maybe I wasn't the only one in the world who  was young and had been dealing with this issue.  Since the movie is from  England, I also realized this is happening all over the world.  It is a  great reassurance to other gay youth that we are normal and that there is  someone out there in the world for all of us.  Although we are gay, we can  still find love and happiness.  These are just the feelings I felt after  watching the movie.  I even showed this to my family to help them  understand that even though i am gay, i am still a person and in need of  love.

Exceptional performances by Glen Berry and Scott Neil., but I must admit  the standout performer in this movie is Linda Henry.  This is a strongly  recommended movie for gay teens who are exploring themselves, as well as  for straight teens, who will gain a better understanding of how their gay  counterparts feel. For those teens out there who may not know how to get  the ""coming out"" dialog started with their family, this is the  perfect movie to break the ice.

7871480,5,6304410832,"I've been a big fan of the movie since it's release in the States back in 1996. An achingly romantic love story that focuses on two London (Thamesmead) teenage boys -- the loner shy Jamie and the more popular jock Ste(ven) -- with a (rare for the time) happy ending. Momma Cass and her music uplift the story from beginning to beautiful end as the characters fight against the monotonous struggles of their lower working class lives while coming to terms with their sexual desires.

Coming from the U.S., there's a ton of British slang, though easy to get the gist. Admittedly, reading the play script helped round out some missed moments for me along with some scenes not found in the movie that explain certain lines that hadn't really made sense to me until reading it there. I would also recommend viewing the live play (from 2013) at the Digitaltheatre.com website to fully appreciate the play as originally written by Harvey for the stage.",1521936000,,945,4.7272727272727275
