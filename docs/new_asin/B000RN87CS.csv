2869639,5,B000RN87CS,"When liberal Jewish lawyer Danny Duckelman (David Strathairn of ""Good Night and Good Luck fame) is appointed to represent a neo-Nazi skinhead Michael Downey (Andrew W. Walker), to say that sparks will fly is a trite, gross understatement. The screen practically self-ignites as these two individuals have a battle of the wills in Director David Gow's (along with Mark Adam) brilliant movie adaptation ""Steel Toes"" of his critically acclaimed play ""Cherry Docs"" (the name of the Dr Marten steel-toed boots worn by skinheads). Mike is incarcerated for attacking an Indian restaurant worker-- for no apparent reason other than his nationality-- by stomping him with his steel-toed boots. The man later dies from internal bleeding but not before he foregives his attacker in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes from the movie and wishes for him that he ""finds a better road to walk.""

Even though some of the scenes between Danny and Mike are what we would expect from two people whose views of the world are so different, the movie never, ever becomes a cliche. Even though the director says in an interview included with the DVD version of this film that he opened up action from the two-man stage version, adding other characters and scenes of the racially diverse neighborhood where Danny lives with his wife in Montreal as well as moving scenes from a cemetery where he says that six generations of his own family are buried, the film is still essentially about Danny and Mike and the interactions between them.

Perhaps what engages the viewer most in this emotionally powerful and explosive film as the two men engage in shouting match after shouting match--""at one point, Danny screams at Mike: ""it's not your eye color, sweetheart""-- is the subtle changes that come over both men. Mike in the beginning hates Danny, along with all other ""Zionists"" and would kill them all if he could while Danny, for his part, certainly has no love for this skinhead with multiple tattoos either. When Mike yells at Danny to hit him, he responds that ""if I started hitting you, I might not be able to stop."" Both actors are superb and become the characters they portray in a film that was finished-- unbelievably-- in 19 days of shooting. (The director and producer of films like ""Cleopatra"" should take notice.)

I would not say that this movie will entertain you. On the other hand, you'll be hard put to find one that has more to say about racial hatred and diversity. It may upset you but you will not soon forget it. It is simply one of the best things I've seen in a very long time.",1190160000,45,2580,4.767337807606264
2869640,5,B000RN87CS,"STEEL TOES is yet another low budget, independent film that unfortunately will not find the large audience it so justly deserves except by word of mouth publicity.  It is available now as a DVD, complete with significant extra features, and is one of the more powerful statements about hate crimes, understanding intolerance, and the journey toward compassion this viewer has seen.  It is adapted from the original play by its author, David Gow, and benefits from the fact that David Strathairn, who created the role on stage in Philadelphia, and repeats his performance on screen, subtly embodies the lead character Danny Dunkelman.

The title, STEEL TOES, is derived from the name of the combat boots worn by Skinheads, the band of racially intolerant men who strive to re-enact the tenets of Nazi theories.  The film opens in Montreal with a group of these warriors, led by Mike (Andrew Walker in a career-making performance) who gruesomely kicks an Indian man repeatedly for no apparent reason except racial hatred.  Mike is arrested, placed in prison, and faces a charge of homicide when the hospitalized Indian man dies of his wounds.  Danny Dunkelman is the court appointed lawyer assigned to defend Mike.  Danny is Jewish and acknowledges a loathing for Skinheads and it is the confrontation between Danny and Mike that polarizes the story between two men who innately hate the symbol each stands for. Danny is a committed humanist and tries to overcome his prejudice by carefully preparing Mike for hi courtroom appearance.  Likewise, Mike for the first time begins to gain insight into the misguided life he has chosen, finding Danny a man whose compassion shows through his belief system and is the only chance Mike has for avoiding a long prison term for manslaughter.  One key and poignant aspect of the case is the document the Indian man made before he died, a statement of  his loss of sight, ability to walk or sit resulting form the brutal beating he received from Mike, and yet it is a call for compassion and forgiveness he makes just before he dies.  Danny repeatedly makes Mike read this document until a change occurs - a climax in a story and in a relationship that is one of the more significantly powerful ever filmed.

This is essentially a two-character story, though in making it cinematically fleshed out some additional characters are added.  But the impact of the story comes shining through the economy of the prison cell set and from the impeccable performances by both Strathairn and Walker.  It is a brilliant work of writing, acting, directing, filming and sound that bespeaks the strongest aspects of committed ensemble work.  It is quite frankly a film everyone who cares about the future of humanity should see.  If there is any justice in the industry it will not be overlooked at Oscar time.  Highly recommended.

2869641,5,B000RN87CS,"Steel Toes starts off with a hard-to-watch, rather terrifying scene and goes on to explore the rage inside a man many of us might like to see given the electric chair for his crime. I'm a big fan of David Strathairn and his performance here as a lawyer is nothing less than I expected. An A+ film that I would recommend to anyone (except children).",1188604800,66,348,4.369230769230769

2869678,5,B000RN87CS,"This is not my usual fare at all. I watched it only because David Strathairn is in it, and because I know him to be one of the few actors who chooses his film roles very carefully and never sells out. I have been watching him for decades. The films he is in may not be box-office hits, but they are invariably interesting. This one only confirmed my judgment. You may read the description and say, ""I don't want to see something like that,"" but if so I suspect you should give it at least a half hour's watch. It is in fact an excellent film on most levels. It explores so many different layers--our ability to change, our ability to influence someone else's change, our ability to delve significantly more deeply into what it means to be a whole human being, and, yes, our discomfort with all of that. I wholeheartedly recommend it, but especially to anyone who likes movies that challenge the mind or aren't simply a lot of meaningless commotion.",1482019200,7,948,4.485549132947977

2869700,4,B000RN87CS,"As one who was intimately involved with skinheads in the late 80s and early 90s I can honestly say that this movie embodies the nature of hate crimes in a sincere way. It likewise narrates a believable story of self-forgiveness. Speaking from experience, the protagonist, Michael is about as close to a real skinhead as any movie character, with the exception of the kids in Made in England. Michael's character resonates even more with me because of his distinctly North American slant on the skinhead ethos. This is the story of a young man who felt disenfranchised, powerless, and frustrated. His crime, sad to say, is one that was not so removed from real events. To all but the most stupid and pathological personalities, it is generally self-evident, that hate groups are a self-defeating and self-destructive path. Though the film does not dig into the life issues that draw kids into this kind of lifestyle, it does create a multi-dimensional character. The lawyer, Danny, is not a super-savior, rather he is doing his job with a subtext of ulterior motives. The price that Danny pays for his dedication to his profession, is the result, not of societal backlash for a Jew defending a neo-Nazi, but rather the type of price professionals pay when they loose sight of their own humanity.

This film's  powerful examination of anger and violence and forgiveness, not exploitative of broader societal fears. I think that in today's strange and vitriolic political environment, that it has particular meaning, if for no other reason that to remind us that fear and hatred have dire consequences for both the hated and the hater.",1471046400,3,1632,4.952554744525547

2869702,5,B000RN87CS,"Steel Toes is one of those movies that is so eloquent that I felt much of my own anger at the world challenged to be examined.  For whatever reasons that caused his anger, the protagonist is triggered into beating a man to death, who he, apparently sincerely, claims he never intended to kill.  I am an angry conservative white male, years beyond retirement, who will never become a knee jerk liberal (again) but many of these issues (to a different degree) the prisoner is forced to confront have been important to me for years.  Where do you draw the line that indicates the boundaries between evil and reasonable behavior?  If you find it, can you recognize and accept the limits when/if it becomes necessary.  This is not just me!  This is not just white males.  This is not just conservatives.  THIS FAILURE TO BE RATIONAL ABOUT ANGRY REACTIONS HAS BECOME, IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, A WORLD PROBLEM AMONG ALL GROUPS..  Just a few weeks ago, we saw groups of the sweetheart ""grandchildren"" of everyone's benign ""Commie Grandpa"" rove in feral groups through a Trump rally, attack the Trumpsters and then go on TV sternly lecturing us all about how necessary and moral their vile behavior had been because Trump supporters would soon be doing exactly the same thing and needed to be stopped with a pre-emptive strike.
  BTW-- NAZI is an acronym for Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which was the German name for The National Socialist German Workers' Party.  But, but, but ... socialists ALWAYS occupy the moral high ground.

The Attorney was able to defend the accused due to the religious teachings of his father who taught him to walk the path of his religious convictions. This was at the cost of his marriage and the friendship of those who refused to accept his actions as a lawyer defending a person who basically committed a hate crime which resulted in murder.

The basic plot, a young Neo Nazi in Quebec kicks a Pakistani immigrant to death. He is assigned a Jewish lawyer as his public defender. It was immediately evident where it was going and the ending no surprise. I would have liked a few twists or surprises but none were forth coming.

The writing and acting are both powerful, but I didn't like that part of the ending involving the TV interview of the skinhead several months after the conclusion of the court trial.

2869812,4,B000RN87CS,"This is the film version of a play which I saw probably twenty years ago. Both the play and the film starred David Strathairn as a Jewish attorney defending a neo nazi youth who has commited a hideous hate crime.(Strathairn is truly a great American actor as seen here).
 From the start you see the repulsion the attorney has for his client. He appears to be defending him because everyone deserves the best possible defense. This is apparently not the case. At first he is going through the motions of pleading his client guilty ,which the client does not protest but with extenuating circumstance. The lawyer will not provide this for his client. It is this unraveling of the ""why did you commit this crime"" which gives way to the real reason he is defending such a repulsive excuse for a human. The drama is intense. The Strathairn character provides us with a very emotional performance . You ask yourself can this jewish attorney whose people historically have been subjected to hate throughout time really relate  to his client at any level or will he some how find an answer for himself as to the why of such a deed. A need to understand if there can be a person who actually can justify to himself a reason for such an act even to himself.
 At the finish of the play the cast and audience had a question and answer period to examine what they thought the true feelings of both the neo nazi and jewish attorney were experiencing. When you watch this film you wish you could have the same experience the play goers were given. We all know there is a right and wrong here. The question is in the examination of each characters motivations and how the get there.",1429228800,6,1666,4.509933774834437

This isn't fully explained by the script, which in itself is beautiful and leaves it open for the actors to struggle with, which these two men do, beautifully.

We get it, Nazis are bad, so you, the movie, don't have to force-feed the idea to us. The Jewish lawyer is a boring character whom the film tries to portray as a broody, pseudo-witty do-gooder but comes off rather lame. (SPOILER WARNING:) The ending is borderline cheesy as the neo-Nazi criminal ""finds the light"" when he reads his victim's letter in which said victim speaks like a (rather clichd) Buddha. Sure, you can convert an angry, violent, hate-filled fascist at the drop of a bat by getting an Indian guy to write him some nice words. All they need is a little sunshine and rainbows!

The two-dimensional characterization and lack of psychological realism ruined the movie for me. Movies like ""American History X"" do a better job exploring this subject matter.",1355616000,9,1085,5.06145251396648

A lawyer is appointed to represent him in court who just happend to be Jewish.

How can these two men with opposite upbringing and values work together on young man's defense?  Is it possible for two of them to be in the same room, let alone reconcile on how to present this case to the public?  Can people change?  Once they do change will the world believe in their full rehabilitation?  What does it mean to someone on a personal level to be involved in this moral dilemma?  What is does to professional career, friendships and marriage?

This is one of the most powerful moral dramas I have seen so far.  It took both actors lots of courage to imerse themselves in their roles.  Difficult to watch at times, but at the end it is simultaneously gratifying and hearbreaking.",1246752000,2,1013,4.475409836065574
2869828,5,B000RN87CS,"This really is a ground-breaking and career-making performance by this talented Canadian actor. I completely surrendered to this film and was totally engrossed by Walker and Strathairn's portrayals. A real bonus is the interview with Andrew Walker on the DVD; it is hard to believe that it's the same person who portrayed Mike and will offer an even deeper appreciation of Walker's talent as an actor. Walker's facial expressions and body language of Mike the character are seamless and extraordinary. It's absolutely no wonder he won a Best Actor award for tackling one of the most difficult characters to be portrayed in the last 20 years of film. Walker maintains a level of intensity that never wavers, and does possibly the best job I've ever seen of demonstrating the psychological effects of someone locked down in solitary confinement (but does not evoke sympathy from the viewer) and portraying a character who has so many resistant and difficult layers. This movie is a successful examination of intolerance, rehabilitation, and forgiveness, and surprised me at just who does the rehabilitating and at what cost. Andrew Walker is one of the most talented actors we have universally today and I only hope he gets the opportunity to do more films of this caliber and level of difficulty. I fell in love with this film and the characters immediately despite the difficult and disturbing subject matter, and can't imagine any other actors portraying these characters with anywhere close to the level of intensity and dedication that Walker and Strathairn do.

Someone renew Walker's visa or get him a green card pronto! The USA wants to see more of this great actor! Bravo!",1207267200,3,1679,5.039568345323741
2869829,5,B000RN87CS,"Simply put, the performances are mindblowing because they are so real and the issues are so important to our society. Maybe the best on screen performances I have ever seen. You can tell from the rich and meaningful dialogue this was an incarnation of a play. The kind of film you want to discuss with anyone important in your life, especially (older) children. It runs the gamut so effectively of every human emotion, I am getting choked up thinking about it. Beautifully explores all aspects of spirituality and the conflicts of selfish love, hate,ignorance,and prejudice with spirituality. I will be haunted by this film for a long long time. A viewing of this film may change the courses of lives of those that see it. I think this should be required viewing in high school.",1191715200,4,778,4.770370370370371
2869830,5,B000RN87CS,"I was literally blown away by the performances in this movie. It is a very human drama dealing with the difficult subjects of racial prejudice intolerance, and hatred as well as forgiveness,compassion and realisation.
David Straithairn plays an attorney who despite being Jewish accepts a case defending a Skinhead accused of murder. The role of the Skinhead is played to chilling effect by Andrew Walker, whose disregard and disdain of all those he deems as 'inferior' is truly hard to watch -how can a person have that much hatred, yet very real given how polarised the world today is.

David Strathairn's Jewish lawyer is mesmerising to watch, and his inner conflict out of defending someone whom he personally abhors for all that he stands truly makes an Oscar-worthy performance. Andrew Walker's Skinhead role too is credible and deserving of praise.

What makes this movie truly special besides its controversial subject matter is the powerful dialogue, especially the conversations, often inflamed that takes place between the two main characters. It is indeed a character-driven movie and makes for a riveting watch, with plenty of lessons for all of us.",1191283200,7,1162,5.175531914893617
8201503,3,B000RN87CS,"What this film serves to underscore is how soft on crime the Canadian criminal justice system is, where a vicious hooligan commits a senseless murder and receives a short prison term. This is what liberal judges have done.",1524787200,,222,4.868421052631579

8201507,2,B000RN87CS,"This is one of the worst portrayals of an American skinhead I've ever seen. The guy was way too soft. The actor was inappropriately cast. Any American skinhead would've knocked the teeth out of that lawyer the minute he started talking down, mocking and insulting him. The 'skinhead' was a total wimp and likely a straw-man creation by the film-maker, who likely never met a real one. Granted, most American skinheads are violent stooges of average intelligence and a distorted understanding of Nazism, but they tend to be very violent and have large clans or gangs that they operate in. There is no such thing as a lone skinhead. What a boring waste of time. This felt more like an 'After School Special' than some garden variety tale of taming the savage beast and repenting for a crime. If you want to see an honest portrayal of skinheads, check out Gosling in 'The Believer' (American), Russel Crowe in 'Romper Stomper' (Austrailia), a young Tim Roth in 'Made in England', or preferably the German film 'Combat Girls' (those guys and girls were hardcore!).

8201509,5,B000RN87CS,"Very powerful.  At first I was a little confused on the portrayal of the skin head, but as the part goes on you see it is not lack of acting ability, but rather he completely makes you feel what he is supposed to.  Anyone who thought that was poor acting didn't get the part.  I wanted to see this movie because of Andrew Walker who has taken to playing family roles.  I wanted to see if he could play a different role.  My mind accepted him as a completely different person. Job exceptionally done. The lawyer must have been chosen, I would hope, for the type of actor he portrays since he always seems to do the same role at least that I have seen although he did his emotional role well.  I found the movie very compelling, and was moved by the ending and the true remorse depicted along with actual discipline.",1512864000,,814,4.287581699346405
8201510,5,B000RN87CS,"Powerful. Truthful. Insightful. The hate the Jewish attorney extracted from his White Supremisist client, had more of an effect on him, than the attacker. That hate, came back in the destruction of his marriage. His ability to furthrt litigate once fame hit him on the great sentence awarded the skinhead turned. Did the hate really get extingusihed? Or just move to another direction, another 'fabric''?",1503792000,2,404,5.230769230769231
8201511,3,B000RN87CS,"The PC thing to do would be to give this movie 5 starts and praise it to high heaven (so to speak). I can't do that. I've seen all this before. Edward Norton plays the skinhead who kills a minority in American History X. He repents and tries to keep his brother from following the Neo-Nazi path. And there are many other good movies about Nazis and skinheads vs. Jews.

These days it seems no one would dare criticize a movie where a Jew converts a skinhead back into a human being.

I believe skinheads thrive on hate and hate can never win in the end. I believe that Hitler killed 6 million Jews.  But I've believed these things for over thirty years.  So rating this movie simply as a movie, it just wasn't great.  There wasn't anything new in it. I mean sure, it might be fine to play to high school students who don't have a clear picture of these things yet.  But for educated adults who have read Elie Wiesel and Anne Frank and countless other accounts of Nazi attempts at genocide, there really isn't much of import to see here.",1500595200,4,1036,4.314432989690721
8201512,5,B000RN87CS,"Watched this recently with Amazon Prime. I'm not familiar with Canadian actors, but they did a great job in this movie. Not a typical Hollywoodish movie. It feels very raw and realistic without any loopholes. Go see it.",1495670400,,219,4.7894736842105265
