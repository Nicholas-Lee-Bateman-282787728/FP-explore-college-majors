8070633,5,B0009YXD4C,I have always been a fan of Tony Little's workout tapes. This is an excellent workout routine. You can feel the results after just a few days.  Love it!!,1394496000,,153,4.275862068965517
8070634,3,B0009YXD4C,"PRO: I've forgotten how great Tony Little's workouts are, especially for those who are seriously out of shape, which I am. It's more quality than quantity. Most videos today can run from 30hr. to an hr. With Tony Little's workouts I'm done in half that time, and I don't feel like a failure because I can't get through the workout, because I'm not a former back up dancer- -which I'm sure most of the people you see working in the background are.

CON: I thought this was a new DVD series. If you have the BODY EXPRESS series, don't bother, essentially they're the same. Among my favorites in his series are FAT FREE and PRIVATE SESSIONS.",1366156800,,638,4.5

8070637,5,B0009YXD4C,"This is an awesome workout that does not waste any time, or ever get boring! As always Tony is so inspiring, and motivating, and the music in the workout is great. Oh, by the way, results??? Oh yeah!! My arms and shoulders, legs everthing has become so defined. I combine this with a series of other workouts, although this is a personal fav. I do this one at least a few times a week, and always do a different weight to alter the intensity. Never gets boring, highly recommend!! Thank you Tony!!",1231113600,,497,4.413043478260869
