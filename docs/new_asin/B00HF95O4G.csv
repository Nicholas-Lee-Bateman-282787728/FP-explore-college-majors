8632283,5,B00HF95O4G,"I love the Kelly Coffey-Meyer workouts. She is engaging, her moves are challenging without being overly complicated, and things are always moving along so you don't get bored. I love that the pre-mixes allow me to build a longer workout that is custom-built for my needs.",1481760000,2,271,4.913043478260869
8632284,5,B00HF95O4G,"This DVD has 2 great uncomplicated cardio workouts. Workout one is lower impact then the second and both are easy to follow. There is no complicated choreography to leave you feel like you're hustling to keep up (i.e. The Firm DVDs). The music is great, Kelly is wonderful as usual. I get a good cardio workout for the short investment of time.",1477180800,2,344,4.564516129032258
8632285,5,B00HF95O4G,Great exercise DVD. Highly recommend this DVD - I love all of Kelly Coffey-Meyer exercise DVD's.,1472428800,,96,5.0625
8632286,4,B00HF95O4G,"This is a good workout DVD. I have a very active job and sometimes I still want to get a short cardio workout in my day. This DVD is perfect. There are two workouts to choose from, each 30 minutes - which is about all I have time for. One is upbeat and catchy, while Two is a little more intense. Both are easy to learn and you there is room to modify it to meet your individual needs. There is also a short ab/hip/glute video.",1461628800,3,427,3.9767441860465116

8632288,3,B00HF95O4G,"I am an advanced exerciser and have loved many of Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness because this is the amount of time I am willing to give on a daily basis to working out.  This is not one of her more difficult workouts, but it is still a good quality and fun cardio workout.  I wasn't breathless like I expected to be during a sufficiently challenging cardio workout, but I did enjoy it enough to keep it in the rotation.  Compared to other ""cardio"" workouts out there that are really nothing more than a warmup, it is decent, but it still seems Cathe Friedrich still has the corner on the challenging workouts that I prize.  Kelly is a close second, though, and I love her demeaner - fun but not annoying at all.",1452297600,4,711,4.323308270676692
8632289,4,B00HF95O4G,"great, easier then most of her hard workouts.",1428537600,,45,4.75
8632290,5,B00HF95O4G,"I just love Kelly's workouts.  They're pretty much intermediate, easy to follow but decent cardio. What I like about Kelly is that she always has a modifier if you want lower impact but you can also supersize her workouts by doing faster reps and higher impact. The first workout is less intense and lower impact than the second. I use weighted gloves for the first one to add intensity. Kelly has a great sense of humor. The Premixes give you a chance to either do both workouts for a longer session or mix and match. This dvd also has a bonus premix for abs/hips/glutes.",1426377600,3,572,4.5
8632291,5,B00HF95O4G,"Kelly Coffey-Meyer's DVD's are a must for the intermediate home exerciser.  I found this work-out fun (especially workout 1) and challenging (workout 2).  The music is upbeat and matches Kelly's enthusiasm.

I have been a home exerciser for a very long time and I have to make certain that I don't over-do the high impact aerobics.  I am 66 and can do Kelly's workouts.  They are great for increasing fitness but doing so sensibly without pushing too hard too soon.  That is important at my stage in life!

Any of her DVD's are highly recommended.",1402876800,6,547,4.6947368421052635
