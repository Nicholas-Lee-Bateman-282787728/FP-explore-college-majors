4571151,3,B005535JSK,"I had been looking forward to getting this season and seeing the gang again.
I could tell from the first story that ""something"" was missing.
I don't know if it is the difference in writers or if they just aren't giving
it the same quality attention they did when they wrote Season 1, but I just didn't
feel it was as good.
I think leaving out the ""personal"" parts of the their lives hurt the stories as that
broke up the seriousness of the stories. For me it gave it a good balance.
Sandra and Jack seem much crankier than they usually are.........
Just not as much fun to watch, but there were some good stories and those were the ones
with Brian and Esther.
Hope Season 8 is better.",1340668800,2,684,4.269230769230769
4571152,5,B005535JSK,"The 2010 season of ""New Tricks"" is the latest available on DVD in the U.S.  It is as satisfyingly fun and quirky as we have come to expect from our favorite Britcom series.  The final episode of this season had us worried in the beginning, as it was so intense we thought it would be a cliffhanger of the sort that absolutely drives you crazy until the next season comes out.  However, it was resolved quite satisfactorily.  ""New Tricks"" does not need cliffhangers to keep us coming back for the next season.",1340236800,,508,4.489130434782608
4571153,2,B005535JSK,"Something (well, a lot of things) is missing from what I thought was the peak of interesting storytelling and spontaneous natural acting between seasons three and five.
First season was a little rough especially the not-so-imaginative case scripts with unnaturally quick final minutes' resolutions/confessions and actors still becoming comfortable with each other. But, each season improved with good repartee, wit and humorous exchanges amongst our castoff crime squad; even the stories improved in intelligent sleuthing, topical social backdrops and unusual crimes but this season seemed like we have fallen way back to rote non-imaginative scripts; rushed predictable endings and most importantly I found barely 3 chuckles worth of witty exchange in all ten episodes. The actors looked tired and almost disinterested as if they were just going through routine acting motions. Perhaps it's a result of a change in some of the directors and writers these past couple of years or perhaps the writers and directors have lost that creative, ""spontaneity"" drive?
The cinematography/editing is rather poorly performed such as constant face switching; zooming; poor framing of scenes.
The show needs to add some energetic fresh face to liven things up. And, the actors could use a wilderness retreat or something similar to get fit and regain a mental zest and focus. Even the guest actors seem to be type cast and scripted the same way year after year and episode after episode.",1339977600,8,1474,5.330472103004292
4571154,4,B005535JSK,"I love New Tricks.  I practically do a count down on my calendar waiting for the next season's DVD to come out, so of course I began watching it within hours of Season 7's arrival from Amazon last weekend.  I haven't seen the last two episodes yet.  But as much as I enjoy the great acting and the camaraderie between the four main characters, the key ingredient for me is missing this time around.  We still get to see Brian's home life with Esther but nothing much out of the office for the other three.  No family problems for Jerry nor any cooking, and evidently Jack isn't discussing his cases with Mary any more. There is a small smackerel of something for Sandra, which satisfies an itch from Season 6, but we never see her at home. And I can't reconcile the rooms in Brian's house with what they looked like last season.  They've had the decorators in and the rooms look larger than they did before.

Which leaves me feeling as if old and dear friends have suddenly stopped inviting me into their homes. Still solving cases brilliantly, still having fun in the office -- but I miss the intimacy.

Every season has had one episode that I watch over and over.  My all-time favorite is the one when Esther cuts her hand and Jerry cooks that gourmet dinner for her.  In fact any time Jerry heads into a kitchen makes me happy.  I hope Season 8 will go back to those informal moments. I haven't found an episode that I want to watch from start to finish twice in a row in Season 7.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Tricks-Season-7/dp/B006O2S63G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Tricks: Season 7</a>.",1339372800,27,1646,4.801418439716312
4571155,5,B005535JSK,"Unsolved murders, psychic sleuth, past abduction, arson, & bank robbery cold by 3 decades tough for the team ego. Buckets of guest stars including a bevy of beauties. 10 episodes, filled with one-liners. Humorous expressions roll faster than clues in this fast-paced but retirement age police team.
..........Cast: DS Pullman (Amanda Redman-`Little Dorrit') guides 3 ex-cops on unsolved crime & open cases (UCOS). This team's personalities & relationships make this award-winning fun. Pullman tough, realistically slightly overweight, but yet sexy. Brian (Alun Armstrong-`Garrows Law') is an old alcoholic, tech nerd with a photographic memory. Jack (James Bolam-`Beiderbecke Tapes') a widower of a murdered spouse, & Gerry (Dennis Waterman-`Sweeney') aging playboy. DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf-`Upstairs Downstairs') is their often antagonistic boss. And we must mention Brian's wife Esther (Susan Jameson-`The Queen' and voice for Catherine Cookson audios). Expect first name familiarity in New Tricks, like in a family series. They are a cop family. Episodes always have a difficult past crime, plus personal issues of the UCOS team. You will laugh through the sleuthing efforts. You'll see many guest stars.

SDH SUBTITLES for almost 10 hrs. UCOS-Unsolved Crime & Open Case Squad
............BONUS: Behind-the-scenes featurette * Bloopers
Episodes in DVD order; 1:  Dark Chocolate

2:  Good Morning Lemmings
Graffiti claiming ""I killed Flak"" sprays London. Dad Flak by Chris Barnes (Horatio Hornblower) It's a 4-year-old dead case. Why now? Former taggers checked. Brian Twitters disturbingly.

3:  It Smells of Books
Brian says libraries `smell...hold wierdos,"" but loves em & goes undercover. Library pals played by Anne Reid and David Ryall. But a man's roof dive after checking out a stack of books seems a crime, not suicide. A plot?

4:  Coming Out Ball
Debutante abduction heats. An Irish Republican Frontist (Ian McKlhinney -Little Dorrit) has new info for Sandra & team. Sian Phillips plays Lady Elizabeth. And I enjoyed Amy (Sophie Ward -Land Girls) a good bit + Ms Jones (Annette Crosbie -One Foot in the Grave). Sandra's school reunion.

5:  Dead Man Talking
Psychic (Paul Rhys- The Queen, Bonekickers) says a dead daughter's dad's not done. Is the clairvoyant a fraud--as Sandra thinks? Eldridge (Jo Stone-Fewings) a blood relative? Beswick is David Bradley (H. Potter).

6:  Fashion Victim
Eight yrs past designer Levene stabbed. Bolts of suspects: brother (Rupert Graves -Garrow's Law, Forsyte Saga), Beck (Peter Wight -Titanic), sexy PA (Tuppence Middleton.) Gerry's real-life daughter is back (Hannah Waterman).

Boxer (James Grogan) shot ages ago Never a weapon-`til now. Learn about professional boxing-if you dare. Also see Matthew Marsh (Iron Lady), Maggie O'Neill (Shameless), Del Synnott (Murphy's Law), and more.

9:  Where There's Smoke
Drink club fatal fire, goes underworld. Old silence finds a speaking witness. Trustworthy? Seems more smoke than fire. Brian fires up his arson skills.

10:  The Fourth Man
DI Paterson (Phil Daniels- Chicken Run) investigates a 3-decade past robbery of 10 million & 2 killed. Evidence may point to copper corruption. John Shrapnell (Notting Hill, Elizabeth: Golden Age, Troy) plays a bad guy here. Is UCOS in jeopardy? Auto forensics.
A great dialogue line referring to the 3 retired cop guys: ""Nurse. They're out of their beds again.""",1333324800,16,3855,5.490693739424704

4571193,4,B005535JSK,"Fans of NEW TRICKS in the U.K. recently learned that series co-star James Bolam (Jack Halford) has announced he is moving on from the show. The reason? Its becoming stale, he said. Viewers beg to differ. Season Eight has seen the highest number of viewers in the U.K., an achievement which so impressed the BBC (producers of the program) that they have commissioned a ninth and tenth season of the show, to be broadcast in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

Mr. Bolam is certainly entitled to his opinion, but perhaps there is a reason he was cast as Jack Halford, the most irascible of the lead foursome! In the past, Bolam has expressed in interviews his disdain for people wanting to know about his private life. Also, he has refused to sign release forms allowing for some of his previous projects to be re-run. In so doing, he denies his fellow performers any opportunity for continued recognition of their work and affecting their bottom line by denying them residual payments for the re-runs. Sounds a tad cantankerous to me.

Be this as it may, NEW TRICKS remains a fun show. Season Seven (Eight will follow soon over here, no doubt) may not be the most compelling series to date, with its focus at times more on catching the bad guy rather than the mix of quirky personalities, but its still a great ride and Amanda Redman just gets sexier and stronger. Shes arguably the most interesting, attractive female lead in the cop show genre.

The Bolam defection is old news now, though we here in North America have yet to see his last season, number Eight. When Acorn Media releases it we can all say our goodbyes to Jack Halford, not NEW TRICKS. The brilliant Denis Lawson (Ewan McGregors uncle, if that interests you) has already come on board to replace Bolam. Lawson will appear as retired Detective Inspector Steve McAllister, and will no doubt inject some new energy to the next 20 episodes in Seasons Nine and Ten.

Season Seven, our season under review here, comes with more great guest stars, including the great Sian Philips (formerly Mrs. Peter OToole and one of the stars of I, Claudius, the immortal epic recently released in a special 35th anniversary edition by Acorn Media) and Samantha Bond, my fellow student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in the early 1980s (and still a talented, stunning beauty).

Of course weve seen most of this before in previous seasons, but time spent with this group of seasoned pros in a show that so wonderfully showcases their many talents is always a pleasure. NEW TRICKS isn't anywhere near being old yet. Agree to disagree, James Bolam.",1397433600,,2592,4.725663716814159

The mysteries are engaging and one grows more and more fond of the officers as their back stories are gradually revealed.  Well done.,1388620800,,504,4.423913043478261

4571205,2,B005535JSK,"I discovered New Tricks this summer and ordered seasons 1 thru 5 followed by season 6 and now season 7.  While viewing these I was also watching the most recent season on the local public television station  (season 9?)
What drew me to this program was it's development of the relationships between the 4 main characters.  The were not only shown in their workplace settings but also their ""home"" settings.  Loved the humor amid the drama of reopening new cases.  Just like real life it has it's highs and lows and each character has their own baggage brought into the mix.
Unfortunately, by season seven there was no family related scenes for Gerry or even Jack (speaking to his deceased wife).  The only personal related scenes were for Amanda's half brother and some with Esther.  Without those personal insights into their respective personal lives this series becomes like any other cop show.
I didn't have an issue with a change in character when Jack retired although I loved his laid back character.  The real problem is the program lost it's original theme...""senior"" detectives"" doing an unenviable job in a high tech world while they remained  (initially) low tech (like the picture board which no longer exists).  New Tricks holds no charm for me since it's lost it's focus and depersonalized it's characters.  For these reasons I couldn't give this 5 star program (initially) anything more then two stars.
Highly unlikely to purchase any more seasons.",1380585600,3,1464,4.9346938775510205

4571235,5,B005535JSK,"As I have expressed on this board before, I am a huge fan of ""New tricks"".  Season Seven (7) of the series again is splendid with ten (10) episodes running about an hour each on three (3) discs of what I describe as ""tight"" well acted mysteries/detective/crime series.

Series seven (7), once again, has three (3) incorrigible older codgers that have been ""returned"" from retirement to form a ""team"" to solve some cold cases that appear to be ""unsolvable"".  These older retirees use older (they do seek help from computers) and non politically correct methods in solving the cold cases much to the ""horror"" of the establishment and to their ""short-fused"" younger leader Sandra Pullman (brilliantly acted buy Amanda Redman) who sometimes just loses her ""cool"".

The ten (10) episodes in  Season  seven (7) are filled with loads of humor and some really good mysteries that kept me guessing ""who done it"" until the very end.",1350259200,,922,4.878205128205129
4571236,4,B005535JSK,Still an outstanding intelligent watch.  The team still clicks because the writers are staying faithful to the characters and the actors who have matured beautifully.  Will purchase additional seasons.,1349395200,,201,5.896551724137931
4571237,5,B005535JSK,"Brief Synopsis: After a career altering mishap, to her dismay and seeming demotion, Detective Sandra Pullman is given the job of heading up a small task force to re-investigate with the hope of solving, lest be disbanned, cold cases. Ms. Pullman must also find her staff from a list of retired detectives, still alive, who are interested and able enough to be of worthy of the job.  First comes Jack Halford(James Bolam), though reliable, methodical, and the most reasonable is a broken-hearted soul who speaks to his dead wife nightly as though she were still alive. Then there is Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong), who is handicapped by many clinically-diagnosed emotional issues but a genius in his own right. Then comes Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman), a man of many ex-wives and daughters, who not only loves women but actually likes them, who can and enjoys cooking, and though technically a honest ""copper"" is not above unethical behavior if he feels it warranted.
  So we have the premise, and this group makes it all worthwhile.  This gang of ""old geezers"" use the tricks of new technology combined with their ""old tricks"" of experience and life years to solve crimes thought to be unsolveable. Under the superb leadership of the ""Govenor"", as Gerry calls her, Superintendant Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman)makes a delightful watch as she handles her smart, wizened, damaged, elderly but juvenile staff with the diplomacy of a Mother Superior guiding a group of teenage boys. Retaining professional decorum and keeping focus on the task at hand, she uses her considerable intelligence, sass, and quick wit to become the artful and respected leader of the crew.  Watching the inter-action between these people it is hard to believe that it is not real, the acting is seamless and the plots imaginative.  There is comedy, tragedy, and friendship found in this working relationship.  I have purchased all 8 seasons, with the 8th not yet arrived.  I have loved every moment of the first 7 seasons and am looking forward to the 8th.  I hope this show lasts forever.  It's Alright, It's Okay, Doesn't Really Matter if You're Old and Gray...........",1348704000,,2145,5.0
