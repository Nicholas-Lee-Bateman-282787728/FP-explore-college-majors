4260041,5,B004448GJU,"Set in Provence before WWI, this film shows a way of life that is deeply worth visiting, if only on film.  People still living in touch with nature, they are beautiful in face and form and actions.  The story is wonderful, too, but it's almost incidental to the pleasure of this beautiful place and the simple way of life.  The actors are perfect, the music is great.  There's not a false note in this film.  I do hope that it reaches a wide audience in this country.  It is like sweet medicine for over-wraught spirits.",1357171200,15,520,4.421052631578948
4260042,4,B004448GJU,"This would get a five star rating, except there are several scenes and a large block of pertinent scenes that were cut out of this version.  Why this was done is shocking and stupid.  To keep the film in it's original version would make this film perfect..  I've notices this happens regularly with DVDs, and I deeply resent some inept cretin editing films for some stupid reason.  All that aside, this is a fabulous film but it is weakened by stupidity..",1357171200,16,455,4.580246913580247
4260043,5,B004448GJU,"A quarter century ago, Jean de Florette/Manon of the Spring transported us to the sun-drenched world of Pagnol's Provence. Five year's later, My Father's Glory/My Mother's Castle brought us there again. What a delight it is to be able to return there two decades later with Auteuil's update of ""The Well-Digger's Daughter."" For me, it was just what the doctor ordered at the end of a year when Americans have been so exposed to so much violence--both on and off-screen. Even our Christmas releases are filled with blood and death these days. See this film if you enjoy stories with warmth, compassion and humanity.",1356912000,27,614,4.913461538461538
4260044,5,B004448GJU,"""I don't like the corked wine"", Pascal said. In the movie it is losely translated as ""I don't like the fancy wine"" which is not quite the same. This sentence summarizes this movie. The pure mentality of the French villager "" la campagne"". He prefers his own wine, (they make and cork their own wine from their own vineyards). He doesn't want to buy somebody else's wine. He doesn't want to be like ""les Parisiens"". He has contempt for the Parisians. He doesn't want to be part of the city ""elite"". He wants to live peacefully in the countryside with his family, his rules, and his routine. ""Vous savez les impts moi, on en a marre...""

The movie is about Pascal (Daniel Auteil, a well-digger) father of six daughters living the hard life in the countryside in France, at the start of World War I. He always wanted a son, and he tried and tried, but he got six daughters. His wife died after the last daughter was born. He sent the oldest daughter Patricia (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) to live in Paris when she was young, but after his wife died he called her back to help him raise the other five daughters. She is well educated and he wants her to get married with his friend/assistant Felipe (Kad Merad), a nice simple man but much older than her. Of course she doesn't like him and is falling for Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle), a wealthy young pilot just in town for few days, whose parents are rich and own the big grocery store in town. She is impregnated by him just before he is called back into duty. What is going to happen next? Is he going to come back from the war? Is she going to tell her dad about the situation? Are they going to keep the baby? How the villagers and Jacques' parents going to react to these events? Those are some of the questions coming to mind. You will definitely get surprised by the answers and the plot of the movie. It is not what you expect. Hence, Marcel Pagnol's genius...He understands the human mind better than anybody else!

This is another great adaptation of the work of Marcel Pagnol by Daniel Auteil, but this time he is also the director. Twenty five years later Daniel Auteil went back to the source that made him famous. Who forgot Ugolin playing alongside Yves Montand (Csar) in ""Jean de Florette/Manon de source""? Daniel Auteil has the exact same accent, the same movements and same interaction with the camera, just few extra pounds. After I watched this movie I had to watch ""Manon de source"" again!

This is a fabulous film and Daniel Auteuil takes over with his very poignant acting. He delivers some of the most powerful performance I have ever seen by an actor in several scenes. If you really liked ""Jean de Florette/Manon de source"" you will definitely appreciate this movie. Is not as intense as the other two movies, has a different plot, but really describes the mentality of the villagers in the countryside in France that is slowly disappearing these days because the people are disappearing. If you want to see and feel the French countryside mentality during the 1900's, then watch the movie!

Five stars all around for everything but mostly for the powerful performances of all actors which are remarkable.",1356739200,55,3174,4.602473498233215

4260046,4,B004448GJU,"I alternated between being charmed and a bit put off by actor Daniel Auteuil's directorial debut -- a sweet (sometimes sticky sweet) re-make of Marcel Pagnol's 1940 film. The film is a bit odd tonally; alternating between occasional bathetic intense emotion (scored to opera at times no less), and being a slightly too convenient and cute comedy of manners.

Some modest spoilers ahead.

Auteuil plays a working-class paterfamilias with 5 daughters, including an 18 year old favorite he has seen only as a perfect angel. But now she has brought the family to shame by getting pregnant by a rich and handsome local boy, who promptly leaves to fight in WW I -- and her father turns on her and casts her out.

The film seems to want to have it both ways  we're told to feel bad for the cruel banishment of the daughter, but not TOO bad, since in the end dad (now grandpa) has to prove to be a good guy at heart. Auteuil - an actor I usually really enjoy  gives a slightly hammy (if admittedly amusing) performance, bouncing a bit too far back and forth between near monster and adorable gruff old guy. Also slightly problematic; the young couple are beautiful, but there's not a ton of spark there either individually or as a duo.

There are some very good scenes, and I was extremely taken by Kad Merad in a supporting role as an endearing 40ish friend/employee of the father who is hopelessly in love with the young daughter. For all the rough spots, I modestly enjoyed the film. It's just that there were hints of a terrific movie early on, so when it ended up as just a nice, old-fashioned and somewhat predictable one, there was a sense of disappointment.",1482969600,,1657,4.562289562289562

A couple of the plot lines had inexplicable - and implausible reversals.
And once committing itself to snore-dom, it finishes us off with a mawkish ending.

I'd rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars due to a few significant disconnects.  A bit more information, and less imagination would improve it.  For example, Jacques apologizes ""I was a brute.""  For what??  And going from a motorcycle ride to ""I'll be having a child soon"" is disconcerting.  How does that happen without even a passionate kiss or eager hands?

4260106,5,B004448GJU,"My wife and I are pretty picky about the movies we watch; we don't often get to sit down for two hours and we want to be glad we spent the time as we did.  We both enjoyed this film.

This particular story is beautifully wrought.  The sunshine, the casting, the details... it's quite an immersion.  There is nothing easy about this story.  As a result, it feels more like real life.  None of the characters is completely good or completely bad.

How many films have you watched where the circumstances are the plot and the characters are the figures around which the plot happens?  The Well-Digger's Daughter is the opposite: the development of the characters is the plot.  Something about that arrangement will resonate with you.  Yes, there are circumstances that drive outcomes, but you will find yourself more concerned with the relationships in front of you.

One of the things I particularly appreciated about this film is that it doesn't glorify poor decisions.  It doesn't inject artificial romance into a situation where real romance wouldn't yet exist.  As a result, you will identify closely with the situations because you've personally felt those conflicting emotions at some point in your own life.

Finally, you will get the most out of the story if you keep the context in mind.  The time, the culture, and the society in which it happens all have bearing on the outcome.  If these characters existed today in middle-class America, they might behave differently, but you will still be able to relate.

Be prepared to think about this one from time to time even days after you've watched it.  Enjoy!",1382486400,26,1614,4.807272727272728

Full of visuals and sound, there is something fundamentally cinematic about Pagnol's prose: given that Pagnol directed 18 film versions of his own writings, I think it is fair to use the words ""reader"" and ""viewer"" interchangeably. ""His"" films, including this one, put the viewer in an Ozu-like state of restfulness while simultaneously offering up the challenges of the moral nuances of the story. In fact, with the exception of Ozu, I can't think of another cinaste who has put me so at rest only to unveil the combating emotions of joy and pain that accompany every aspect of life.

The transfer to Blu-Ray is impeccable. If you have ever visited the Provence region of France, you will find the ""found lighting"" of the exteriors very realistic--after all, this is where the Impressionists went to paint! (Much of the film was shot in St. Rmy de Provence, where Van Gogh painted some of his most celebrated canvasses. The opening shot announces where we are, with its field of yellow flowers.) The cast is perfection. The sound mix is gorgeous: the noise of the natural environment supports the drama in equal portion as the score by Alexandre Desplat and the tidbits of source music by Billie Holliday and Caruso. The ending is absolutely Shakespearean, if by ""Shakespearean"" we mean his comedies.

4260135,4,B004448GJU,"The playwright, novelist turned filmmaker Marcel Pagnol will be remembered for his 1930s romantic films such as ""The Fanny Trilogy"" (which consists of ""Marius"", ""Fanny"" and ""Cesar"").

An award-winning French filmmaker who worked on more than a dozen films, for many who grew up with his work, his work captured France in the early 20th Century.  By 1940, Pagnol would go on to direct ""La fille du Puisatier"" (""The Well-Diggers Daughter""), a film that would would later catch the interest of actor Daniel Auteuil (""36th Precinct"", ""Cache"", ""Un Coeur en Hiver"", ""The Valet"").  An actor who also was once directed by Marcel Pagnol long ago for films such as ""Jean de Florette"" and ""Manon of the Spring"".

So much that it would lead to Auteuil to write, direct and star in the 2011 remake of the film (Auteuil is currently working on the remake of ""The Fanny Trilogy""). In collaboration with cinematographer Jean-Francois Robin (""Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud"", ""Betty Blue"", ""Chaos"") and composer Alexandre Desplat (""The King's Speech"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1), the film was well-received by film critics.

For those who have been waiting for a home video release of this film, ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" was released in the U.S. in Dec. 2012 courtesy of Kino Lorber on Blu-ray and DVD.

VIDEO:

""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The first thing you will notice is how beautiful the scenic shots are.  Jean-Francois Robin takes a page from Marcel Pagnol's writings of the countryside and capturing the beauty of the area, the flowers and the look of old France.  The film showcases many colors during the outdoors, while the indoors looks amazing because of the amount of detail that can be seen.

Shot in 35 mm, picture quality is incredibly well-detailed.  You can see the textures of the clothing, skin details, the film looks magnificent in HD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialogue-driven but the surround channels provide a good amount of ambiance for its countryside environment.  You will hear the birds, during the air show, you can hear crowds.  But what sticks out the most is the music.  Alexandre Desplat's music is absolutely beautiful and moving.

The film is presented with English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" comes with trailers and 16 stills from the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely love Marcel Pagnol films.  Its his way of covering romance and family, that is a style that makes me enamored with Yasujiro Ozu's work.  They have a unique style of capturing an era of their country that is of the past but relationships that are tied into family tradition and honor.

Sure, ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" can seem banal on paper, daughter gets pregnant, must tell parents and must raise child on their own.  We've watched films like this, we've seen dramas about this.

But what makes this film so enchanting is how it centers around an old traditional family and how Pascal tries to keep his family's honor by having the man's family acknowledge her pregnancy and the baby.  But to see how this loving father get dejected, lose his honor and essentially is forced to cut ties with his own daughter.

We also get to see the distinction of class differences, as Pascal is seen as a well-digger, Mme. Mazel is a woman who does not want her son mixing with poor women, and to why she burned the letter mean for Patricia, was it because she looked poor?  Possibly.

But it's that display of one's guilt of getting pregnant before marriage and the inconvenience that was tied into the old traditions.  Which may be hard for one to fathom in today's world, of many single parents and where family honor especially in the family name, in most modern cultures, are a thing of the past.

The performances of the film are also quite notable.  French actor Daniel Auteuil has starred in many films, but his role as Pascal, he manages to portray the aged, hardworking father with efficacy.  Also, you have another talented actor in Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Jacques' father and also actress Sabine Azema (partner of filmmaker Alain Resnais), playing Jacques domineering mother.  The film features solid performances by these veteran talents and definitely makes this remake quite enjoyable.

While the film takes place during wartime and showcases an enjoyable romance melodrama, you can't help but watch these films and yearn for the days of old.  The storytelling of Marcel Pagnol that is able to fit in the complexities of old traditional values but also make it appealing and enjoyable for today's audiences.  While I have not seen the original ""La Fille du puisatier"" (as only a few Pagnol films have been released in America), for this remake, I absolutely enjoyed it.

Wonderful acting, enjoyable storytelling and beautiful cinematography... What a wonderful remake from Daniel Auteuil and a homage to Marcel Pagnol's work!  ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is  recommended!",1364601600,3,5111,5.027348394768133

4260140,3,B004448GJU,"Marcel Pagnol made LA FILLE DU PUISATIER in 1940 - and it is a minor masterpiece.  Oh, what terrific actors - Raimu as Pascale  (the well digger) and Fernandel as Felipe (his good friend) whom he hopes will marry  Josette Day (his beautiful 18 year old daughter). In my eyes, it captures the rough texture of peasant life in the South of France.  And Fernandel does a marvelous job of communicating his effervescent humor. The New York Times included it as one of the top 1000 movies ever made.

Daniel Auteil decided to remake the movie.  It looks better...it sounds better...but in my mind it lacks soul.  The daughter
Patricia - played by Astric Berges-Frisbey - is so lovely and ethereal, she does not seem borne of the earth.  Even though she is returning from Paris, it seems impossible to think of her as a peasant.

Of course, Auteil is excellent in the role of the dishonored father who discovers his daughter is impregnated by the son of a wealthier family that rejects her.  Provence is absolutely breathtaking in the film (that's the best part), and the opera music of Enrico Caruso is handled capably.

Alas, the movie did not move my heart or engage my brain.  A delightful confection of the moment rather than a film I want to remember for a long time.",1360886400,3,1267,4.582222222222223
4260141,1,B004448GJU,"Why awful?  Well, unless you understand French or have a TV screen the size of a garage door, you won't understand a thing.  The subtitles, if you can even call them that, are so tiny I can only figure the producers of this DVD are mocking those of us who can't understand French.  It took me a bit to even realize the titles were turned on.

I turned it off after a minute.

Usually I complain about Granada, Koch, A&E and others who don't bother to put captions for those who are hearing impaired, like my mother is.  In this case they should at least include some Pimsleur French lessons.  Why even release this in the US?

8415837,2,B004448GJU,"This remake of a 1940 movie by Marcel Pagnol eliminates a few things, most notably the repulsive pro-P&eacute;tain, pro-Vichy elements of the original. What remains is, nonetheless, a rather puzzling work, in which the standard Pagnol story (Marius, Fanny) of a girl gotten pregnant by a young man who has gone absent is overlaid with a rather heavy ""family values"" slant, pretty much in synch with the rightwing, Catholic ideology of much of France at that time.

In the original Pagnol film, the stilted script and the stagey, preachy dialogues were offset by the brilliant performances of Raimu, Fernandel, and Charpin.  Auteuil's actors aren't bad, and his Patrica is miles better than Pagnol's insufferable Josette Day.  But they are not a match for those aforementioned male titans, who make the old movie worth watching despite its flaws. This version is OK to watch, I guess, but it seems to accentuate the weaknesses of the original, without resuscitating the old flashes of brilliance.",1493510400,,995,5.12962962962963
