7877486,5,6304810903,"This one is for you Joe.  Yes, Ladies its true. Although it does have a very silly plot...Tarzan and ape running thru Manhattan and all. However, He certainly is Beautiful.  Just for the record...his real personality matches.  Knew him in LA.  (Too bad I was too young and scared!!!)  WORTH THE $ LADIES!",1129075200,7,304,4.660377358490566
7877487,3,6304810903,"I used to be a monster Joe fan and although I don't have the movie in DVD, someone sent me the t.v. movie in a VHS tape when it first aired in '89. I doubt the DVD is any different. As a bit of trivia, this is Joe's first movie and it started my collection and ironically 8 years later was he asked by the same producers to play Tarzan in the year long show Tarzan: The Epic Adventures for one reason alone. He looked the part. Epic showed his growth as the ape man, while Tarzan In Manhattan displayed him as the bright-eyed child unused to civilized ways. Anyone get a load of that awful suit Jane made him buy? Really funny, and Joe with his pinache acted as if nothing was out of place. I was and still am amazed when I see the movie how naturally funny Joe can be as demonstrated in the scene where he's left alone while Jane showers and he wanders in the kitchen after being startled by turning up the t.v. volume and the stereo and he accidentally turns on the full blender and he gets splashed and another scene where he brings a bouquet of flowers, plunks them in a pot and says with a sly smile ""lunch"". I hated Jane who  prattled on about all her failed relationships while hoping Tarzan would still be interested in her instead of just saying ""hi"". I tossed a feminist hairball in the way her father played by Tony Curtis acted because he refused to  give Jane the credit of being able to manage her own life no matter how much she grumbled. He'd never have done that had Jane been his son. Nor was he funny when he kept referring to Cheeta as ""Chiquita"". Cheeta driving a Police cruiser was funnier than Tony Curtis could ever be. The entire story itself was lame but as Joe is nice to look at, he made the movie watchable and I might add will always be the best Tarzan of past and present. If you want to have some fun with a light hearted Tarzan, hike up your loincloth, collect your Cheeta from the swinging chandalier and get Tarzan In Manhattan.",1123977600,15,1963,4.232
