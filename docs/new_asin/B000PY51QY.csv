2828828,5,B000PY51QY,"This is Route 66 at it's very best!! The transfers are straight from the masters with everything left in like they originally aired. Commercials, Next week previews, etc. The studios will not release the classics shows this way as they should. 90 percent of the people that buy these classics shows are collectors. And they want everything left in! The studios don't get it! Nor do they care! It's their way or no way! This is the real way to preserve are Television History! Thanks Roxbury Entertainment! We salute you and want more soon!! Don't think about it!, Buy it! This is truly ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"".",1181088000,14,609,4.648148148148148

8193888,4,B000PY51QY,"I was young when this was on the air, and at that time was in love with the show.  But not so much now.  it was fun seeing it again but forgot how beatnik it was at the time.  Love watching the advertisements though again.  Sure shows how much has changed in this world since those days.  Not always for the good though.",1413244800,,320,4.015873015873016
8193889,1,B000PY51QY,"It is filmed in black and white.  It is the most slow moving film I
have ever seen.  There are actually commercials throughout.
I found nothing interesting about it at all.  The big name
stars had bit parts.  I saw no redeeming qualities about the
film.  It was completely boring, I wondered why anyone
wasted the time and money to make the film.",1397174400,,346,4.428571428571429
8193890,5,B000PY51QY,"If you want a terrific overview of this series' entire run you can't find anything else like this in one package. These are some of the finest episodes, the greatest guest stars and conflicts between Todd and Buzz as well as inner conflicts between Todd and Todd and Buzz and Buzz. Not least, you get to see most of the Corvettes featured on the series.",1251936000,,353,4.446153846153846
8193891,4,B000PY51QY,"Very nostalgic and well-put together collection of episodes.  However, some extras and better menu set-up would help.",1187049600,2,117,5.882352941176471
8193892,4,B000PY51QY,"As a long time fan of both The Road and the TV show, I have been waiting for the release of Route 66 episodes and I hope that more episodes are to be released in the future.  The selection of stories for this DVD was based on the actors who were guest stars and provided an extra interest.",1186358400,3,289,3.9827586206896552
8193893,5,B000PY51QY,"I was first introduced to the show ""Route 66"" when it aired on Nick at Nite in the 1980's, and unfortunately I did not tape any of it. Years later Columbia House put out 20 episodes on 10 VHS tapes, which I DID manage to aquire. I was amazed at how well written the show was, how good the stories were, and the chemistry between all the actors including the guest stars, and there were so many that became household names later on. It quickly became one of my favorite shows to watch of all times.
When I saw this DVD I had to get it, and I was not disappointed!
The quality of the video transfer was excellent, the case seems to indicate it was from 35mm prints, and I would not doubt it. There are original commercials included with bumpers and previews for next week's show on some episodes as well. The back cover seems a bit sketchy though, it doesn't list the episodes and looks like a fourth grader designed it- don't get me wrong the video transfer quality is quite good and if you are a true fan you should not turn this DVD down! Finally the show is coming out as a full season set (Pt 1.) in October 2007 by the same company that put this disc together. Hopefully they will have better artwork and include all of the vintage commercials, promos, previews etc. In the meantime though, you will not be disappointed if you pick up this DVD - It has some great episodes on it, and an excellent video transfer!

UPDATE: Roxbury Entertainment releases are the ""Official"" ""Route 66"" releases- when this review was originally written that was not known, so don't hesitate to get this release.

NOTE: This DVD is being reissued with different packaging on February 10, 2008 under the title of ""Producer's PIcks - 11 Favorite episodes"" for those who like this - this is a legitimate release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Route-66-Producer-s-Picks/dp/B001OC9AYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Route 66: Producer's Picks</a>",1185753600,5,1965,4.862686567164179
8193894,4,B000PY51QY,"I was a bit disappointed that for the price of this set, that there was no information about which shows were on it, no booklet...etc...It was really well done as far as quality, but I really would have enjoyed being able to read a little something about each show. Also there is no way to contact whoever made this set to see if they will be making more shows available...my favorite episode ( The Thin White Line) where Todd is given LSD, was not on this set...I have tried ordering the entire series on DVD just to be told it is back ordered, or not available after paying over $100.00 for it, so this set is great to have....",1182038400,3,629,4.294117647058823
8193895,5,B000PY51QY,"Although this is not the ""offical DVD release"" from Columbia House, Roxbury Entertainment did an EXCELLENT job transferring these from the original broadcast film negatives. These 11 episodes are by far the best quality transfers out there. We can only hope that when Columbia ""figures it out"" to release the entire series on DVD, they'll do the same. There's nothing like watching an Episode of Route 66 with the original commercials, bumpers, sponsor tags and previews intact, it transports you back (for an hour) to a time when quality television prevailed.",1181347200,12,560,5.164835164835165
8193896,5,B000PY51QY,"I highly recommend this 2 disk DVD set of Route 66. The 11 episodes are very clear which makes all the difference. In the past, people have sold tapes or disks of Route 66 where they were just copies of copies and the picture quality was terrible! Not here. So if you grew up watching Route 66 or you love the series, this is the DVD disk you'll want to own. The collection of the 11 episodes are a fine representation of the series and they span across all four years of the show. On some of the episodes the orginial commericals are not edited out, but I did not mind that at all. As a matter of fact, it was rather enjoyable to see the espisodes as they were shown back in the 1960's. Some of my friends got a big kick out of the old commericals. I hope more Route 66 are coming in this format! Please make more!!",1181260800,15,816,4.074534161490683
