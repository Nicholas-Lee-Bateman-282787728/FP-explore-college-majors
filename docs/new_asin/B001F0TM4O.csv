3559789,5,B001F0TM4O,"I purchased this DVD for my nephew who works for Red Bull Racing.  I thought that he would enjoy it since he's involved in the racing world, but I had no idea how much I would enjoy it too.  I could tell they tried very hard to give a honest, complete account of Travis' life & career.  Very entertaining & the bonus features are fantastic!  Thumbs up!",1239580800,,352,4.208955223880597

As a rider and fan of motocross and Travis Pastrana, I welcomed this dvd into my collection. Watch his ups and downs(literally) from a toddler to the ultimate X-Game winner. There is much more to Travis than what you see on network tv, and this dvd shows it !!",1237593600,,416,4.024096385542169

3559794,4,B001F0TM4O,"First there is not as much action footage as I would have liked. While I appreciate the attempt to provide some perspective I could do without all the mom and dad stuff. Moreover the DVD changes my opinion of TP.  He always struck me as a very thoughtful and even cerebral guy.  What was I thinking?

My take away from the whole racing thing is that he was not willing to put the work into racing that it really needed.  I watched him come through the ranks and really did wonder what happended to him.  He might have thought that he was not really capable of hanging with Carmicheal.  He crashed at nearly every race he tried to hang with him.  I think he could have hung with him if he had done what he needed to - his potential was nearly unlimited.

In my view he clearly deliberately sabotaged - sorry there are no nice words to use - what he could salvage of his supercross career by making what looked like a really stupid jump a week before the season start.

The car wreck?  What the hell was he jumping in his car at 150mph?  That was just plain stupid not to mention being irresponsible.

And his Dad:  ""I'm really going to miss him when he finally kills himself.""

TP's accomplishments and his nice guy status somehow remain largely untarnished but the questions remain.  He has done very well in the X games and when he doesn't crash he tends to win races in his rally car although I'm not surprised that his co-driver has ""retired.""  Hopefully he will do well at the World level.

If nothing else this DVD is an fascinating look at the life to date of a pretty interesting guy who is a genuinely nice guy at the end of the day.  TP would certainly be an interesting guy to hang with.",1235952000,2,1697,4.283018867924528
