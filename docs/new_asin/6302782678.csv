I would NOT recommend this movie to any child under 16 because of the nature of the information in it. I know, kids are more mature these days, but seeing flesh burned off of a human being isn't something I'd allow any child to see. It was hard enough for ME to see it! Is it totally accurate with it's information? I can't say for sure but it does show what the bomb did to the characters it focused on and makes me wonder.....is war really worth it? How about a nice game of chess instead.",1373155200,6,635,3.96875
510790,5,6302782678,I have looked for this DVD for along time.  The total over whelming destruction of the city and in the middle of all this there were people helping other people. The lesson this bomb teaches should not be forgotten.,1354838400,3,215,4.512820512820513
510791,4,6302782678,"This is a film about the bombing of Hiroshima as seen by American, German and Japanese eyes.  It is a single film with several stories.  One story is of an American aircrew shot down and interned in Hiroshima and how they were influenced by the dropping of the bomb.  Another is of a German catholic priest and how the exploxion has changed him.  Then there are several Japanese views; one a school boy who is trying to carry out his classmates final request, a Japanese physician dealing with the medical aftermath of the explosion such as radiation poisoning a malady only then seen once in a while from overexposure to x-rays, and the trials of an expatriate Japanese-AMerican woman who is living with her in-laws and expecting a child.  A Japanese-American woman is played by Tamlyn Tomita it is ironic that she meets hostility and suspicion because of being Japanese American.  In the US she would have been interned.  In Japan she is allowed some freedom although she is under surveillance by the secret police.  There are Japanese charecters who wish to continue the fight against the allied powers regardless of cost to themselves.  There are characters who are tired of the war and then finally there are charecters that are just tired and need to rest from the privations that the war has brought to them.  This is a story of the aftermath of the use of the atomic bomb and the effect it had on people of that moment.  Ultimately, at the conclusion, there are no enemies, just survivors.  It is a movie that should be seen to gain some understanding of what took place that day and how, over 55 years later, the world is still trying to cope with what happened there.  It is also a reminder that not just Japanese were in Hiroshima the day the bomb was dropped.",980035200,16,1771,4.601910828025478

7831109,5,6302782678,"I saw this movie some years back, but forgot the name.  I googled for movies on Hiroshima, and found Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes...and when I looked up the actors who starred in this movie I found Judd Nelson among those...and remembered he was one of the primary actors.  Granted it's not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but if you want to see an accurate depiction of what really happened when the A Bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I don't believe there's another movie out there which can even come slightly close to matching this.  This is every bit of a 5 star movie...and I believe anyone who watches this will concur !",1478736000,2,644,4.487179487179487

7831111,4,6302782678,I am glad to find this movie after years of looking. I had always known that my father (a Seabee) had been in Japan following the war. I had once asked about a photo album he had from the war where the last few pages only held the old black corners that should have held missing photos. My father never gave me an answer - until this movie. The night it was shown on TV we watched it together. All of a sudden my father started talking and I learned that immediately following the surrender my father and some other Seabees were assigned to duty in Hiroshima. Their assignment was to get generators up and working (and keep them working) at the hospital which this movie shows. My father died less than 2 yrs later and without this movie I would have never known exactly what happened over there and what my father saw.,1452643200,2,819,4.324675324675325
7831112,5,6302782678,"Excellent Japanese experiences of the dropping of the first Atomic Bomb.  It has some very horrifying scenes and can be a tear jerker, the ending especially.  It made me wonder if this should have happened.",1444953600,,206,4.857142857142857

7831117,1,6302782678,Max Von Sydow was the only positive thing about this entire disaster of a movie. The movie  was another sickening apology to the Japanese by a liberal uneducated film maker. The film maker's view of history does not make any sense.,1412121600,,231,4.634146341463414
