7826409,4,6302468515,I was in Paradise when I saw this tape. I didn't like Jon and his girlfriend singing thought the other songs I did like and they were danceable to say the least. The story itself was not great but pretty good. I give this movie a 8 out of 10.,1189641600,,242,3.86
7826410,5,6302468515,"This classic Garfield tale once more revolves around Jon Arbuckle deciding to take a vacation. He takes his typically lethargic cat along for the ride, disguising him as his young son so as to avoid having to pay for an extra seat.
From the beginning, it is obvious that nothing is going to go to plan, primarily because Jon is such an absolute cheapskate that he took the cheapest deals he could get.
Things seem to take a turn for better, though, when they hire a sleek car to go in search of a beach. Again, however, things are not as they seem, and through a series of odd, if not supernatural events, they end up in an out of the way village surrounded by a bunch of oddball natives, with the volcano about to go kablooey.
Naturally, it's up to Garfield to save the day - or so it seems. There's a nice little twist in this one that I won't give away here, should any of you Garfield fans be lucky enough to lay your hands on a copy.
Needless to say that all's well that ends well. The fun is in how they get there.",1068681600,5,1020,4.156565656565657
