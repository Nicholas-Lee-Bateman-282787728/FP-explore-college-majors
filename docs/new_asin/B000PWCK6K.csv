8466406,5,B000PWCK6K,"I came across these guys while searching through new releases on a rental website. After watching two episodes, I was HOOKED! These guys are hilarious. Apparently, trailer parks are the same all over; kitties, cons, and dysfunctional comradery. Be warned though, drug use and the f-word run amuck. For adults only.
This show is a huge hit in Canada, but hasn't run uncut in America. It's a shame, but not surprising. Innovative and realistic. Shot like ""Cops"" except from the small-time criminal's point of view. If you're looking for something different to watch, you need to check this out!",1191196800,,592,4.98989898989899
