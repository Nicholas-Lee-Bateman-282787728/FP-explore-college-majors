1107801,5,630598946X,"""best actor"" at the Venice Film Festival that year--both well-deserved honors. Courtenay's cockney and young, fair face with his sometimes affect-less eyes (which I attribute not to stupidity, but to shell-shock: how many stupid men respond ""I don't know"" to every question of motive put to them?) and Bogarde's crisp, precise English, his dark, expressive eyes, often belying the lack of expression in his face--are perfect foils for each other.

If this is a sound stage--it's the wettest one I ever saw! It rains almost constantly, everyone gets muddy, there are no glass windows, the corrugated metal roof is torn, and everyone is constantly tramping through the mud.

There IS an extra fillup for us pacifists: the trial, which showed signs of turning on a point of military law, resolves itself on a point of military expediency of surpassing idiocy--we will execute this man because the men need a boost to their morale. WHO is stupid around here?

Besides the drama unfolding before us, we get to witness the court marshal of a rat, who has bitten the ear of a sleeping enlisted man (encouraged by his wakeful comrades). He is confined in some sort of metal container with wire over one end, as his prosecuting atourney asks him questions, rapping on the metal container with a metal rod...eventually he begins to squeak. He is duly executed with rocks.
Courtenay vomits up the Eucharist.
As the firing squad is given the order to shoot, we are stationed directly behind one of its members, and we see his gun moving off target (I think this was common practice, perhaps even ordered by officers, that almost all of the men aimed badly, only one or two aiming well, so that all did not have to feel guilty....

Good God, what a glorious thing is war!

When Bogarde is told why his defense of the private failed, he looks in the mirror and recites a bit of Carroll nonsense:

  There's a porpoise close behind me
  And he's treading on my tail.

Nonsense?

1107802,5,630598946X,"Despite contentious subject matter - a World War One court martial for desertion - and the melodramatic weaknesses of the source material (John Wilson's radio play Hamp and J.L. Hodson's novel Return to the Wood), Joseph Losey's King and Country admirably avoids most of the clichs and preconceptions of its day in favor of something much more even-handed and unsensationalized, and consequently its matter-of-fact approach is much more powerful: indeed, the final moments almost unbearably so. Tom Courtney is the very simple soldier facing a court martial for desertion, carried out almost as an afterthought and certainly as an inconvenience to the officers who have to try him and would rather just forget the whole thing, with Dirk Bogarde the officer who draws the short straw of defending him in the brief proceedings. Nobody really wants him to be executed and no-one really expects he will be: most death sentences were revoked. It's just his bad luck that his court martial comes before an offensive when an example is needed ""pour encourager les autres."" The ending is, of course, inevitable - it has to be or there is no story - but it's no less powerful for that. If anything, it's more so.

For a filmed play it is ironically in many ways more overtly stark and cinematic than any of Losey's other films, especially for a production that never moves from the soundstage. And what a soundstage - Peter Mullins' sordid ramshackle behind-the-lines set is quite astonishing, making a real virtue of its limited resources, at once claustrophobic and economical but also practical for the intricate camera movements Losey adopts, Denys Coop's naturalistic black and white cinematography putting the artificiality of more recent films like The Trench to shame. There's also an intriguing use of archive photos, including a memorable shot of a deteriorated corpse in the mud slowly dissolving into a shot of mud and rain that seamlessly suggests the corpse fading away into the mud. The brief inserts of home - a live-action shot of a child as posed for a photo, a friend sitting in bed drinking tea, a shot of an old woman sweeping her step - are interesting, if not always successful. Even the harmonica score by Larry Adler (like the director a blacklist victim who fled to the UK) turns the film's extremely limited budget - there simply wasn't enough money for an orchestral score - to the film's advantage.

All too often Bogarde's performances in Losey's films can seem formal and a little cold around the heart, but no such complaints here. Bogarde had a genuine interest in the period (many of his own paintings were WW1 subjects) and while his character is at a social remove from the man he is expected to defend and ultimately execute, there's a real sense that he's invested in both the part and the picture. Tom Courtney, who also stood court martial in Private Potter, is at his best here as the confused, none-too-bright and painfully inarticulate working boy who only gradually begins to realise the enormity and inevitability of what he's up against. And they're well matched by an excellent supporting cast in the officer's mess - Leo McKern, Barry Foster, James Villiers and Peter Copley.

The only wrong note is the over-stylised stage-chorus nature of the scenes with the enlisted men, which Losey unwisely left rehearsing to Vivian Matelon (who also plays the Padre), who treats them like a bad left-wing theatre workshop production: a shame, because their shifting sympathies and often cruel attitudes ring true even if the performance style doesn't. Yet despite those lapses, there's a level of realism that the low budget affords: even the trench rats that thrived thanks to four years of good eating but are rarely dealt with on screen are present and all too convincingly correct. A genuinely great film, it's a more than worthy companion piece to Paths of Glory, and it's a shame that it's now all but forgotten. It's true that the DVD transfer could be better (the only real extra is a brief trailer), but it's still a worthwhile purchase for the film itself.",1194307200,12,4095,4.914739884393064
1107803,4,630598946X,"The year prior to making King & Country, director Joseph Losey and actor Dirk Bogarde had made their break-through film The Servant and scored a major critical success, becoming one of the leading actor-director teams of the English-language art-house circuit of the 1960s.  King & Country was their follow-up, and it was a worthy one.  The film concerns a private (Tom Courtenay) who deserts and is court-martialed during WWI.  Bogarde plays the officer who defends him -- reluctantly at first, more sympathetically as he gets to know the private and the stressful battle conditions that led to his desertion.

As an anti-war film, King & Country holds few surprises, but that's not the point.  Losey had worked with the great dramatist Bertolt Brecht, who believed that the content of a story mattered less than the way you told it.  That logic is on display here.  Losey is primarily concerned with criticizing the bureaucratic nature of military thinking and with exploring the dynamic contrasts between the upper-class officers and working-class enlisted men, each of whom understand duty and fate in very different ways.  The movie is deliberately paced, but the running time is quite short, and the performances of the ensemble cast are uniformly excellent.  Losey also avoids inadvertantly glorifying war, as so many otherwise sincere anti-war films do when they give us the vicarious thrill of battle by aestheticizing military conflict (like Kubrick's Paths of Glory) or when they give us solace in the male cameraderie of soldiers (like Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front).  In that regard, King & Country is one of the more successful anti-war films because we never want to be with these characters even though we do sympathize with them.

VCI's DVD is pleasing but flawed.  The print is very clean and in the correct 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  Unfortunately, VCI used a short-cut by simply porting over the British transfer (which was released on DVD by British Home Entertainment, I believe).  The drawback is that British TVs use the PAL system, whereas American TVs use NTSC.  As a result, VCI's DVD runs a little too fast and exhibits ""ghosting"" (a slight blurriness during panning shots).  The print is good enough and the movie is static enough that it isn't distracting on regular tube TVs.  It's just a shame that VCI didn't pay for a better transfer.

I also sympathize with Robert's review below:  There is indeed no subtitle option on this DVD.  That's unfortunate because the combination of various British accents with the poor recording equipment of the British film industry of the 1950s and 1960s means that making out what's being said can be difficult.  (I lived in Britain for a time, where I got used to some of the accents, but even I had to concentrate very hard.)  Finally, VCI has not anamorphically enhanced this film, which means it won't fill up a widescreen TV.  That doesn't bother me with films in 1.66:1.  Apparently, many labels have difficulty making that aspect ratio anamorphic.

In sum, this is a thoughtful movie that deserves wider appreciation.  It serves as one of the more accessible of Losey's ""difficult"" films, and the DVD is worth purchasing, especially since you can regularly find it for under $10 now.",1150502400,30,3266,4.990757855822551
1107804,4,630598946X,Despite its interesting subject this DVD release is a technical failure. The sound is bad and forsomebody that English is not his mothertongue it is very difficult to understand. Why the producer of this important DVD did not work a little bit harder to to put a subtitle feature for hearing impared people as well for less knowledgeable people in English. The subtitle feature should be a routine feature no matter what language is spoken in the movie. I was very disappointed by its quality.,1040256000,17,493,4.811764705882353

Tom Courtney, also a fine actor very good at projecting his character's inner feelings. This film uses both actors to engaging effect. Even though the plot is fairly predictable and the main philosophical points - man's inhumanity to man, moral failure of prevailing authority behind moral platitudes, shallow indifference and claims of contingent necessity. Justice...

First World War. Soldier cracks under relentless pressure. Goes AWOL. Bogard as the officer appointed to defend him in the court martial.

1107901,5,630598946X,"Tom Courtenay is simply stunning in his portrayal of the young private.  This movie was REAL; almost too real, but true I'm certain in the midst of war.  Bogarde is Bogarde. I felt a sense of loss at the end of this movie.  The film is dark and deals with the realities of war.  Nevertheless,  it is a GREAT movie.",1434240000,,314,4.166666666666667
1107902,5,630598946X,"Tom Courtenay plays Private Hamp, he is the lone survivor of his battalion having volunteered in 1914 - some three years prior, the rest whittled away by the arbitrary wantonness of war. He has been accused of desertion and is facing a court martial. Under martial law he is allocated an officer to represent him - this falls to Captain Hargreaves (Dirk Bogarde). What follows is the trial set amidst the rain and mud just behind the allied front line.

Courtenay plays the gullible soldier to a tee, he is basically an innocent lad who is probably suffering from PTSD or shell shock as it was sometimes referred to back then. Bogarde who was always exceptional plays the officer class perfectly with palpable changes in his attitude as the case unfolds. There is also a magnificently pompous portrayal of a disinterested Medical Officer from Leo McKern who steals the scene.

This was made in 1964 and was done for a shoe string budget - that apparently it never made back and that was despite winning awards and being critically acclaimed. However, recent renewed interests might just get this hidden treasure of British cinema some of the wider recognition it so richly deserves - massively recommended",1432944000,,1205,4.873170731707317

Tom Courtenay is fabulous as the soldier in question and Dirk Bogarde is his ho-hum ""let's get this over with lawyer"".  The surrounding cast is terrific. I wish the DVD cover didn't give away the ending...I won't. This is also a scathing indictment of war as a whole. It is always the common soldier who puts it all on the line, the privates, corporals, sergeants. this movies shows how the officers treat the regular G.I. with a kind of contempt. this holds true for every army.

1107908,5,630598946X,"I discovered this movie quite by accident. I was searching for films with Tom Courtenay as I consider him such a convincing actor in everything he does....when I stumbled upon this unknown gem.  Although made as a film, it is really a theater piece about a deserter in World War I, a mere private, who is reluctantly defended by a Captain Hargreaves.  The play was based on a novel by a World War I officer who failed to succeed in defending a real deserter.

The issue here is that Private Hamp, during a battle, quietly almost instinctively backed off, just walked away.  It seems he did not even know what he was doing.  After three years in the trenches, blood, rain, death, horror, he had a moment when he just had to stop hearing the guns.  And he walked, and he walked, and found himself quite a bit away from the battalion that he was serving.  When he was caught, it was believed it was an open and shut case for desertion.

Indeed this is how Officer Hargreaves first understands his duty to defend the officer in the court martial.  But as he questions the 23 year old unsophisticated soldier, he starts to think about what it must mean to serve for so long patriotically and watch every single other man in your company die.  One man was simply blown to bits right next to Pvt Hamp. (Today, tours of duty are usually 12 months...so a 36 month tour of duty would be prejuducial to the sanity of the soldiers under our enlightened standards)

The defense turns on the definition between cowardice and shell shock.  If the solider can be shown to be suffering from shell shock,  Pvt Hamp might receive leniency during the court martial.  But the problem here is that the mental damage to the soldier is gradual, not immediate.  In a sense, the last battle was the straw that broke the camel's back.

The military doctor, played with gumption by Leo McKern,  is pompous and utterly unsympathetic.  He sees the solder as a man with cold feet, nothing more, and is not afraid to offer his small opinion on the matter.

Because it is not exactly a clear cut case of shell shock,  the defense is no easy matter.  Capt. Hargreaves reevaluates his opinion about the soldier, perhaps the WAR itself.  One of the key dramatic moments is when the Court Senior Officers turn to Hargreaves and ask him ""Will you now address the Court on the prisoners' behalf.""  Hargreaves responds.  ""No.  I will not address the Court on his behalf.  I will address the Court on its behalf.""

Overall, everything about this picture forced me to think hard about war conditions for the soldiers - everything is filthy and damp - a metaphor for a bleeding wound.  Even the courthouse - if you can call it that - is nothing but a makeshift blown out wooden shelter from the rain. There is nothing glamorous about the war in this film...it is one unending trial for the solders with certain death at both ends.

Dirt, disgusting mud, and dangerous rodents infest every part of the lives of these soldiers...and this part of the cinematography is very well done.  They live in a hostile, cramped, and bleak world, a hell.  No escape.  The director brought in dirt and rats to make the movie during its 18 day shoot. He felt that by the end of the experience it was so nerve-wracking he thought he was himself in the trenches during World War I.

This is an IMPORTANT anti-war movie...one that is not as slick as Stanley Kubricks' ""Paths of Glory"",  but one which is underneath far more powerful.  The trial scene is very, very believable..and this opinion comes from a lawyer who has seen hundreds of trials.

And, from time to time, the director simply uses a ""still shot"" - a photograph of some event about the war.  When the words ""King and County"" are uttered by the solider as a reason why he volunteered,  the director inserts a  still photograph of the German Kaiser and the British King (who look very similar) walking contentedly side by side. In reality they were nephew and uncle.  Many have commentated on the royal family feud behind the death of millions in Europe.",1391385600,4,4055,4.562326869806094
