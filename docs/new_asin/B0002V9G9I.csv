With the title ""Great Religions of the World"", and the price tag, I was expecting more like a full length programme dedicated to each of the Great Religions. In part I must take responsibilty for the mis-purchase, through an impulse buy based on the great title, and not reading the product details sufficiently.

The price problem was exacerbated by having to pay an additional 15% tax on import to UK, and an additional post office handling charge equivalent to about $12.",1241049600,2,705,5.017094017094017
8032485,1,B0002V9G9I,"Yeah, that's what this joke of a DVD tries to do. I spend 42 classroom hours over an entire semester teaching the world's religions and it is still inadequate. To even try to pretend to cover all of that material in a half hour is mind bogglingly silly. As someone else pointed out in their review, to charge $59.95 for 33 minutes is ridiculous. EVN videos tend to be on the insipid and vacuous side, but this is the worst I have seen. I am not sure who the supposed audience is supposed to be for this. Certainly not college or high school students. Don't get this.",1215129600,6,566,4.299065420560748
8032486,1,B0002V9G9I,This product was not as expected for the price of $59.95.  I was really disappointed.  It should be sold for $5.00 or less.  It is about a half hour long.  Don't buy it!  I am returning it.  I expected to receive 4 DVD's for that price.,1176768000,12,236,4.021739130434782
8032487,1,B0002V9G9I,"Juvenile, low budget, over-priced DVD. Stick with anything from a major documentary producer or channel - like The History Channel or Discovery, etc.

I'm going to try and return it.",1171497600,15,182,5.066666666666666
