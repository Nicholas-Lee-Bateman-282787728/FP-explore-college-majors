2021540,5,B0001NBNFW,"By far my favorite series of the genre. Never missed an original air date and have watched season 1 thru 4 times.  There is no calling for backup when you're 70,000 light years away from home.  Wonderful concept of having to deal with two different philosophies merging into one crew of necessity. What better of a ""TREK"" than one to find a way home.  A MUST BUY!!!!!!",1081209600,4,368,4.462686567164179
2021541,5,B0001NBNFW,"Voyager is one of the greatest star trek series out there. I have seen TNG and it was ok. Deep space 9 has some good and bad episodes, but overall it just doesn't entice me. When I saw Voyager I fell in love with series. It was Star Trek with a twist: a ship stuck in the Delta quadran. I love the way Voyager explores the conflict of science and morality (Tuvix episode) in a way that TNG and DS9 doesn't. The characters are real and you can identify with them. I also love the science that is involved with the show. Since I am studying Biology, I understand the concepts and it's application to the show.
I am looking forward to the rest of the seasons on DVD. I hope they come out with a Voyager movie, especially since the TNG movies (with the exception of First Contact) have been seriously weak in story line. That last TNG movie, Nemesis, was so lifeless I couldn't believe the studio invested money to make it. I guess I am spoiled from watching the great stories that Voyager has belted out week after week.",1081123200,10,1017,4.302083333333333
2021542,2,B0001NBNFW,"I keep hearing from various people, ""Thank God they got away from the familiar aliens and the Federation so we can truly explore new life and new civilizations"". What new life and new civilizations? We don't even know if they exist period. We're supposed to believe that these people got plopped in the middle of a knot of completely different lifeforms? TNG doged that bullet in the show The Chase where they established that a prehumanoid species spred their DNA, but it didn't go all the way out there. Which means that all those aliens shouldn't even look like us. Also, just how many variations on the human form can you do truly? The only original alien that ever appeared was Species 8472 and they were computer generated. Are we supposed to believe that there are hundreds of alien species out there that all look kinda like us? Just give up the ghost already and work with the wonderful species that you've already established. I gave this season an extra star for Brad Dourif because he's awsome. The best series was DS9 because they just focused on storytelling, not comming up with how to make some person look a little alien enough to pass them off as a new species. It's as believable as if we found a new civilization on Earth. Just give it up already!",1079654400,9,1267,4.58590308370044
2021543,5,B0001NBNFW,"okay--the original Star Trek series started it all and it was great.  i enjoyed/enjoy all the shows that are springing from it, and i'd have to say that Voyager is the best 'child' of the asexual Star Trek parent.  i like that it takes you away from all the traditional Star Trek components.  by writing up a crew that get's lost in a whole new unchartered part of the universe, the writers have put watchers and fans in a totally fresh Star Trek state of mind.  not to mention Kate Mulgrew plays the perfect FIRST female Star Trek series captain.  kudos and more to the show.  i have season one on dvd; can't wait to own them all...specifically so i can watch Seven wrestle with that hottie The Rock in that one episode.

*insert Voyager theme music here*",1079395200,13,756,4.434782608695652
2021544,5,B0001NBNFW,"Voyager's second season combined everything we like about Star Trek and took it to new heights. This season is, in my mind, the show's best; it is certainly the last one where the writers had any kind of focus as to what was going to happen on the show. One great episode after another is what this season delivered, along with a deeper sense of the crew of this little ship, not to mention fantastic science-fiction. What more could a fan ask for?
This season pulls off all of the exposition that the truncated first season did not. We only gleaned general facts about the crew from the first year, but everyone had an episode to shine here. My favorite episode here is ""Projections."" I'm a sucker for those ""what-is-real?"" storylines. It is a solid episode, with the Doctor being more than just smug and surly (although I love it, it can only go so far). Robert Picardo plays disturbed and confused, and Reg Barclay makes a guest appearance. Next is ""Non Sequitur,"" a high-concept episode in which we see an alternate reality where Harry is an engineer on Earth and Tom is a billiards-shooting loser. Like the season that it is a part of, it is a great synthesis of sci-fi storytelling and character exposition. I also loved ""Meld,"" a great Tuvok episode that guest-starred Brad Dourif as a psychopathic killer that Tuvok is obsessed with understanding. The episode examined the enigma of sociopathic killings and it did it in a very effective way. Dourif is one of the highest-caliber guest actors ever to appear on any Trek show, and he is able to be so completely menacing and convincingly psychotic, yet at the same time calm and rational, his performance is reminiscent or Anthony Hopkins' turn as Hannibal Lecter. He is completely mesmerizing. ""The Thaw"" metaphorically looked at how people allow fear to control their lives, with a surreal, Kafka-esque perspective that made it distinctive. ""Resistance"" added more dimension to Janeway by showing how far she was willing to go to save her crew, plus a genuinely potent emotional payoff at the end. The Kazon remain a persistent enemy, leading to the best Star Trek cliffhanger ever (Basics, Part I) that makes things really look hopeless for the crew. There was also a visit from Q in ""Death Wish"" to round out the season.
In addition, there was lots of science fiction here, rather than the sprawling space opera the show would turn into later. Now, don't get me wrong, I love space opera, but not of the sprawling variety. The sci-fi episodes included ""Twisted,"" with Voyager being reconfigured by an unknown force, ""Prototype,"" a look at cyber ethics, ""Threshold,"" which had Tom breaking a seemingly impossible barrier, with disastrous results. ""Tuvix"" is one of the most powerful episodes of the season, and although the setup sounds cheesy, even ridiculous, it is a fine morality play of the highest order. Basically, Neelix and Tuvok get infused due to a transporter accident, giving birth to a new, fully realized and sentient creature. The bulk of the episode's portent has to do with Janeway's decision:  can she deny this new entity existence, effectively kill it, just to save her crewmen, and if not, will she be killing them? I hope it is obvious that this would bring up all sorts of moral questions that the episode sets out to answer. Although the ending is obvious, it actually makes the whole episode more agonizing. In the end, though, what impressed me the most was that there wasn't an ending where everyone was happy, or where they were even sure that they had done the right thing. This was (unfortunately) a rarity in TNG and TOS, where a Deus ex machina would often present itself at the last second, leaving the captain not to have to make a difficult and costly choice. It was here that I began to think that Voyager might become an equal to Deep Space Nine:  it had here the maturity to allow its characters to have to make the hard choices, no tricks, no Q to rescue the planet from disaster, no Ensign Wesley to save the ship, no pressing the old reset button and turning back the clock, no easy way out. And for the time being, it did.",1078963200,103,4125,4.704011065006916
2021545,4,B0001NBNFW,"Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.
Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.
The primary cast members of the second season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr.  Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  Voyager's primary enemy in the second season is still the Delta Quadrant native species known as the Kazon.  With less sophisticated technology than the Federation, several of the Kazon desperately want to capture Voyager to use against their own warring people.  Seska (Martha Hackett), who left Voyager to join the Kazon during the first season, convinces a Voyager Maqui crewmember, Michael Jonas (Raphael Sbarge), to spy for the Kazon. Jonas' spying, the Kazon's desperation for technology and Seska's obsession for revenge culminate in the second season's cliffhanger final episode (a two-part episode that carries over into the third season).
Through the second season, the holographic doctor's personality continues to develop as he works with Kes, the crew encounters the phage-infected Vidians again, Neelix's duties expand beyond cooking and B'Elanna continues her inner human-Klingon battle.  There are also several guest appearances from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" characters, including Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) in episode ""Projections"", as well as William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Q (John de Lancie) in episode ""Death Wish"", which is one of the season's best episodes.  The best second-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Non Sequitur"", ""Tattoo"", ""Resistance"", ""Dreadnought"", ""Death Wish"", ""Lifesigns"", ""Deadlock"", ""The Thaw"" and ""Tuvix"".  The season's least memorable episodes include ""Cold Fire"" and ""Investigations"".
Overall, I rate the second season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars. Sadly, the continued participation of the Kazon started to get old, as was the appearance of Voyager's second traitor (Raphael Sbarge's character of Jonas); but several of the second season's episodes clearly demonstrated that the show could have some very good creative writing.",1078617600,15,4067,5.50801282051282
2021546,3,B0001NBNFW,"The second season continued Rick Berman's stiff attempt to make the show different, except most stories were unmemorable and many fought each other for, what writer David McIntee called, ""maximum dullness"". Once upon a time, Brannon Braga was a talented writer, penning many of the best TNG stories. But now, as the show began year two, he was a shadow of what he once was; more YES man than a writer. The Braga penned Non Sequitur had no real drama, because you knew Harry was going to get back to Voyager and Cold Fire, a belated sequel to the series opener, was filled with many bland ideas and stretched the mind to wonder what Braga was actually trying to say. Then there was Threshold (Robert Duncan McNeill's favorite episode, apparently), which was perhaps the worst episode ever produced in the Trek canon. It was a high concept story that once again showed Trek putting the cart before the horse; hitching their ideas on the thinnest of threads.
One actress I like from the show, was Roxann Dawson, who could take a nothing script and turn it into something special, such as with Prototype. While the script added nothing to the arc and turned out rather silly, her performance made you want to watch the show, even though it could risk death from boredom. There were some highlights of season two, including Meld, which had the always-reliable bad guy character actor Brad Dourif delivering a truly subtle and creepy performance. And only a guest star turn by Joel Grey in Resistance saved that episode. And while not original in any stretch of the word, with uninteresting bad guys and a story that has no real motivation, Grey does salvage the hour.
There was, also, the marvelous return of Q. If you look beyond the obvious ratings stunt the show was, Death Wish was well acted and the script actually works (and mostly because Brannon Braga did not write it). And while the Vidiians make another appearance, the second season is dominated by the Kazon and Tom, Tuvok and Janeway's plan to root out a spy (another one!) on Voyager. Once again, I must mention how silly the Kazons really are and how the only high point was actor Anthony de Longis performance. He brought a menace to the role of Culluh, but sadly he was hobbled with Seska, a shrew if there was one. Thaw was just plain creepy, but in the good sense. Some have said that this show was a real throw back to TOS, at least in the set design. I say that this is what made the show work. It was by means no budget breaker, but its surreal setting and Michael McKean's queer performance really makes the show. As a person who thinks clowns are scary to begin with, I found the idea of people dying by being scared to death really frightening. So, the rest of season two rambled on, but the show still had not found its space legs and concluded with a cliffhanger that was not as good as it should have been.
Basics began to resolve the Kazon issue, but beyond Dourif's return as Suder, the show lacked any sense of threat and it was fairly obvious the crew was going to lose. And stranding the crew on the planet Hannon 4 was out of character for the Kazon, also. However, maybe Seska did have a moral streak running through her. Personally, Culluh should've killed them. While Rick Berman went on to say that to ""keep any kind of substantial conflict going between the Maquis and the Starfleet characters on the show was going to be too disruptive to the Star Trek family we were trying to cement on this ship, lost out there in the Delta Quadrant. We have, from time to time, revisited the whole Maquis question, but I don't think it was a mistake to have minimized the 'warring parties aboard the same ship' concept, so to speak. And it certainly was in keeping with Gene Roddenberry's feeling of trying to minimize conflicts between regular characters."" However, this view was not corroborated by co-creator Michael Piller, who said on the official Star Trek site, ""The one thing that I look back on and think would have made the series more interesting would have been to keep more conflict going between the Maquis and the Starfleet characters, at least during the first season or two. I think there was an opportunity missed early on to slowly create a group of characters that had to grow to know and trust one another. Because of those concerns, we essentially solved the conflicts and they were a pretty bonded crew probably from episode three or four on.""",1078444800,9,4440,4.593198992443325
2021547,4,B0001NBNFW,"After a successful shakedown season,Star Trek Voyager's second season was filled with less hit and more miss moments. Being broadcasted on the UPN network meant for the show to be a more commercial, mainstream show, unlike it's more ambitious sister show, Deep Space Nine. Therefore the show was robbed of any chance at being an ambitious show who's concept of two once opposing crews (Starfleet and Maquis) lost in a distant part of the galaxy and trying to work together to find a way home despite tensions between the two .
  Voyager started off with episodes filmed in the previous season (The 37's,Projections, Elogium,and Twisted).After a few episodes filmed during the season, the show started to slip in quality, focusing more on action, and less on solid story telling.
  The season was littered by mediocre episodes(Parturition, Cold Fire,Prototype,Investigations with the idiotic ""Morning with Neelix"" show,and The Thaw one of the worst ever episodes),while even the better episodes (Non Sequitur, Tattoo, Maneuvers, Resistance, The first Q appearence Death Wish,
Lifesigns,Tuvix,Resolutions, and the seasons best Deadlock) were far and few between. The repeated appearence of the Kazon became redundant even with the traitor Seska adding to the crew's woes(especially Chakotay).
 The season ends with Basics Pt 1 which brings the Kazon arc to a close. But even with a cliffhanger,Season Two is mostly hit and miss.",1078358400,8,1426,5.348214285714286
2021548,5,B0001NBNFW,"I personally found season 2 to be excellent.  So much happens and you get even more familiar with the crew.  You see how the Maquis and Star Fleet work together more and more.  Not to mention the arrival of Seska again with the Kazon.  Just wait until you see Basics Part I where Voyager is stolen by the Kazon and the crew is stranded on a volotile planet.  And to top it all off Voyager's best hope lies in a The Doctor, a murderer, and Tom Paris.  There is so much to look forward to in season 2. And if this is your first time seeing it your in for the greatest ride fo your life.
But wait it gets better hwne season 3 arrives :)",1078099200,12,633,3.984126984126984

2021755,5,B0001NBNFW,"The original Star Trek came out in 1966 or 1967, and I have enjoyed the program since that date.  But what is unique about Star Trek Voyager is there is always something philosophical that appears to be a common thread in the series.  After viewing a episode in the program, I away walk from the episode with an ideal or concept about the human condition that I can put to practice in my daily affairs.

2021761,5,B0001NBNFW,My favorite Star Trek series. Capt. Janeway is the best.,1482624000,,56,4.7
2021772,4,B0001NBNFW,"Season 2 is a substantial improvement over Season 1. Free of most exposition, the writers now turn to what this brand does best - weaving big ideas and great questions into science fiction stories. My favorites included:

Episode 9 Tatoo - this is the best Chakotay centered episode in all 7 seasons, although still not anywhere near my top 10. We all know what a space cowboy episode looks like, but how about a space Indian (space native american?) story? This episode provides a deeply moving answer while exploring the importance of family tradition and touching on the principles of faith that are beyond explanation by reason.

Episode 16 Meld - A taut examination of the dark past of the Vulcan species, during their barbaric phase before the enlightenment of logic. Tuvok has an irresistible attraction to the dark side of a psychopathic killer which drives him to virtually insist on a mind meld. I love the idea that everyone's dark impulses are never far from the surface - not even Tuvok's.

 Episode 18 Death Wish - the Q contemplate the meaning of suicide and death within the context of their omnipotence. Very well developed arguments for and against suicide which, as they must, touch on what it means to have freedom and power and agency. Although it is not directly presented, I found myself asking the question whether I could be fully happy in a world with absolutely no mystery, no joy of discovery like the one the Q inhabits.

Episode 22 Innocence - another good episode about death and dying following shortly after Death Wish. The plot has nothing in common with Death Wish other than certain themes about what is must be like to die. Here, the big idea is how quickly and instinctively we want to believe that our cultural ideas are universal and true to the point that we feel compelled to impose them on others. A very satisfying surprise ending drives home the point.

Among these gems, there are some failed episodes. I tried to cross check writers and episodes but there is no one weak writer. Everyone makes the occasional clunker for whatever reason. These are the worst of Season 2:

 Episode 2 Initiations - yet another weak Chakotay story. A renegade ship commander who survived for years in the disputed territory between Cardassian and Federation space, somehow gets captured by little boy Kazon warriors. Chakotay and one of the boy warriors take turns saving each others lives until time mercifully runs out on the plot.

Episode 5 Non-sequitur - A pointless alternative timeline where Harry Kim time travels from the Delta quadrant back to the Alpha quadrant and his former life. He is on Earth, living with his fiance, working on important scientific research. Naturally he finds himself compelled to abandon this good fortune and risk his life as well as others to get back to the objectively worse timeline he came from.

Episode 11 Maneuvers - [SPOILER ALERT] Preposterous Kazon soap opera concluding with the Im carrying your baby trope. Thoroughly unbelievable from the start with shocking strategic twists and turns all of which were of course anticipated by the other side with previously deployed countermeasures. Probably the single worst episode of all seven seasons.",1482192000,3,3220,4.9025735294117645
2021773,4,B0001NBNFW,"It's STAR TREK, so those who love Star Trek will enjoy it, those who don't probably won't. It certainly has it's moments, and overall, I like it, but there are plenty of inconsistencies in the characters and the situations which give me pause.

Robert Picardo as the Doctor does a fantastic job, which only makes the bad acting stand out even more.  Kate Mulgrew is good sometimes.  I don't understand how she can shine in one episode and drag another episode into the toilet.  I have yet to see an episode in which Robert Beltran performs even on the high school level.  I do not understand how he got the role.  Tim Russ does a fantastic job portraying a Vulcan, even though the series up-ends established Vulcan behaviors.  Robert Duncan McNeill is another actor that only takes away from the series.  Again, the series is very compelling and a wonderful addition to the Star Trek franchise, but bad acting and retconing Vulcan behavior definitely take away from the series.",1477612800,,867,4.733333333333333

2022051,4,B0001NBNFW,"I watched all these years ago as reruns on tv and I'd been hoping they'd get another release at a cheaper price but it doesn't seem to want to happen so I gave in and bought the first two seasons. I'm surprised I remembered as many episodes as I did, although I kind of forgot about the final episode on here and am annoyed it was a cliffhanger for a ""part 1"" episode because I have no idea when I can afford to buy the next season now. I don't know why so many people in the reviews were complaining about this series. To each their own, but I personally enjoyed this one and hated Deep Space Nine. I never minded Generations either, but Voyager was always one of my favorites for some reason.

My biggest complaint is the packaging though. While the idea was interesting, I hate how it was done. The little plastic case box should have been done different. The top just slides right off so if you don't hold the case in the first spot and firmly it will slip right out of your hand and the cheap plastic that holds the discs will likely shatter. Another thing is the plastic holding the discs. They are all held together at the ""spine"" by what looks like a thing piece of tape and it's very difficult to carefully turn the plastic cases to find the right disc. The casing is horrible and it makes it hard for me to want to pay the $40+ for the later seasons.",1472083200,2,1360,4.210727969348659

Yes, I am a ""Trekker"", and yes, I have viewed many times all programs from Star Trek: The Original Series, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Yes, I ordered Voyager because I needed to feed my hunger for about anything Star Trek. I found the contents of Season Two to be better than I had been led to expect. There are many very good episodes, which are offered largely to develop back story of most characters. I would unhesitatingly recommend this collection to others, especially Trekkers.

2022202,3,B0001NBNFW,"Campy end to the ST TV dynasty. The Star Trek series was generally one of promise unfulfilled. A series of silly little vignettes, where the crew pulls the fat out of the fire by remodulating the shields, or employing some heretofore unknown EM radiation, or developing antigens to alien viruses in a matter of days, if not hours. Almost always a deus ex machina. Where there is a story line involving character development, it's usually one-dimensional.
Also, if the crew is representative of Earth, where is the Asian component. Sure, there's Harry Kim, but most of the crew seems Caucasian. This has been a failing in all the ST shows, not just Voyager. Not a critical matter, but just a nagging detail among many.
And how is it the the ship gets pummeled every other episode, but they manage to make repairs and good as new, without a shipyard and refitting. Two years en route now and looks like it was just commissioned.
Interesting possibilities, but just a remake of the original ST...",1461974400,,993,4.745664739884393

Deadlock was a great episode, one of my favorite for the series that I remember. SKIP TUVIX. Bottom 5 episode of the series.

Of course there were great episodes and so so episodes, just as there is with most any TV series. But over all it was a show well worth watching.

2022316,4,B0001NBNFW,"This series is much maligned because it's not as good as TNG. While I do agree that it's not as good, it is good in it's own right, for the most part. There is occasionally bad acting, bad writing, and bad physics but on the whole, it's very watchable. It is better than a lot of TV sci-fi, (or what passes for sci-fi these days) presents some cool sci-fi ideas and does tackle some heavy issues in interesting ways that may make you pause and reassess your convictions.",1455580800,,470,4.3522727272727275

2022326,3,B0001NBNFW,"*edit* Last few disks were actually entertaining. Original review below.

I liked Season 1 but this, Season 2, I can't tell you how many Episodes I have slept through now. I've been getting more enjoyment from the Fan made ""Star Trek Continues"" and ""Star Trek New Voyages"" than this bag of boring-ness.
I really hope Season 3 is better. By the way if you like the Original Series you should check out Star Trek Continues, it's like watching lost episodes and those guys have the look locked down. It's faithful to the series.

Anyway, I wish Star Trek had been more forward thinking as to film on actual Film and in Widescreen like Babylon 5 did. The one good thing I can say about Voyager is that quality is nice and a heck of a lot better than that blurry mess The Next Generation was. Paramount could easily make new DVDs from the HD Masters they have but then people wouldn't buy the Blu-Ray which they poured in tons of money but received little reward as of yet. Meaning, it's selling but stock is moving very slowly.

TL;DR Voyager is good but Season two is a turd. Hope Season 3 better. 3/5",1455062400,,1098,4.425742574257426

2022329,4,B0001NBNFW,I want to give this 5 stars...but I just can't.  The acting is so..wooden.  The characters are unmoving archetypes.  It gets better...I know it does because I watched it sporadically when it was on TV and am now on season 3 where it starts getting better.,1454976000,,255,4.5

2022336,2,B0001NBNFW,"Although this season was better than season 1 I think it  would have been better served to have he crew encounter more hostile aliens. They did way too much character development. Lt. Paris and Ensg. Kim were featured a lot in each episode. The reason the original S.T. (Capt. Kirk, Spock et al,) was so good was that each week they were fighting off some alien looking to cause them damage. Although I clearly understand what the writers of S.T.V. were trying to do they sacrificed edge of your seat drama with almost dedicated boredom in order to get the viewers hooked on the individual characters rather than have withdrawals for the next episode.",1454544000,,651,4.7105263157894735

2022364,5,B0001NBNFW,"Science fiction storytelling is at its best when it provides simple morality plays, and season 2 of Star Trek Voyager certainly delivers.  Most episodes provide amazing opportunities to reflect on our own sense of right and wrong, and give a lot of feeling to the characters.  Including ""the doctor,"" who is still one of the greatest characters of the Star Trek universe.  And although Mr. Spock is everyone's favorite Vulcan, in season 2 Tuvok made me think twice about that.",1453507200,,476,4.925

2022415,4,B0001NBNFW,This series is decent but at times the season would almost become predictable.

2022508,1,B0001NBNFW,"I like the lady that plays Kess, but the character is poor. It makes no sense to have an alien race with a lifespan less than 40. It takes time to learn things. Too many of the shows are weak.",1439769600,,192,3.825

2022518,5,B0001NBNFW,I love watching the relationships build between the characters as they try to voyage back to the Alpha Quadrant. Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay's relationship appears to be taking on a more personal role. I like it. He's very protective of her. I also like the powerful characters Kess and Belanna have become. Season 2 has made Season 3 that much more inviting and I look forward to it.,1439683200,2,395,4.739130434782608

She is very believable as a starship captain.  As well, the supporting cast is fantastic.  The stories are well thought out and the endings are never predictable.  I confess, however, that my favorite episodes on ANY ""Star Trek"" production are those with the impish ""Q"" aboard.

2022565,1,B0001NBNFW,"The ongoing travails of the most incompetent ninnies in the history of the Star Trek franchise. Each season more ridiculous than the last -- how many predictable ways can the crew of the Voyager find to screw up their chances to get back home faster?

Spoiler Alert!
- Every other episode they encounter a nebula in their path, which necessitates stopping and wasting a bunch of time, endangering the ship, and just barely squeaking through with their lives. Either the delta quadrant is packed full of nebulae, or there is a neatly arranged string of them that are 2 weeks apart all the way across from the far end to the Alpha Quadrant, and Voyager is determined to stop at every single one. Maybe their CGI people had a nebula fetish or something and that's all they could draw....

- USS Voyager is a complete tub of junk. No matter how pitiful the adversary, the first shot drops shields by 25 percent, and the entire ship shakes violently for no reason at all. Those great new shields and weapons are completely worthless and Voyager regularly gets owned ... yet no one in the DQ has replicators or transporters? And the inertial dampeners were subcontracted out to the same company Toyota uses for airbags.

- New Starfleet policy saves the day: apparently starships carry so many repair parts that they can have holes drilled through them like a block of swiss cheese, but it's repairable and good as new in a few days. Ditto the seemingly endless supply of shuttlecraft stuffed in the cargo hold; the galaxy is now littered with crashed or blown up bits of Voyager shuttles that they leave behind as calling cards every week.

- The whole show is about how important it is that they find their way home before dying of old age, but these knuckleheads do nothing but stop and explore stuff, or investigate mysterious ships drifting in space, or get in trouble on shore leave, or screw up relations with other species and get embroiled in wars all over the place. Suggesting a new strategy, Captain: Bury the $@#&$ needle at warp 9.975 and don't stop for anything.

- Last gripe -- what's with this piece of garbage warp engine that's the fastest thing ever, but they keep running so short on energy that they still have to ration their replicator use? Oh that's right, we need a lame plot device to justify Neelix the chef, the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek Voyager. Screw that, next to holodeck porn the food replicators are the greatest Star Trek technology ever invented.

Now I remember why I tuned out somewhere in the second season... TNG re-runs hold my attention longer.",1435104000,,2583,4.6535087719298245

But, over all I love watching this series.  It's the best cast of characters since the original, very diverse.  Sometimes the stories are a little hokey  but an enjoyable escape from our everyday realities non the less.  Also, it's good to see a woman playing the role of Captain.  She can be as savvy as the original Captain Kirk.  My opinion is the producers of this series made a smart move with a woman in this role.  Also, the holographic  Doctor is priceless.

2022600,4,B0001NBNFW,"Voyager is classic sci-fi. It's not the best installment of the Trek universe, but it's amazingly good science fiction.

The show has 1 obvious story arc from start to finish, about the Voyager trying to travel the full length of the galaxy to get back to Earth. But along the way they have plenty of mini adventures where the crew has to pull together despite their differences because they only have each other to rely on. That's the magic of Voyager. The main story arc is ever present but each episode is it's own story.

They face old foes like the Borg (who are everywhere) and friends like Q (because what's a Trek series without Q) and lots of new ones that they meet along the way. The individual episodes remind me of 1950's and 60's sci fi stories, only with much high production value. The show even eludes to it's throwback nature by having one of the characters loving to use the Holodeck to relive bad 1950's sci-fi.

Season 2 has one episode that really stood out to be. Episode 24 has Tuvok and Nelix merged together as one being due to a transporter mishap. It was just good writing all around.

Voyager is a fun departure from the Trek series that proceeded it. It's still ""Spacehip flying around meeting aliens"" but it's not constantly arguing with the Klingons and Romulans.

It's well worth watching for the fun ride it is.",1430956800,,1345,4.541322314049586

While some are content with the status quo, others want something different.  The different here is actually getting home from the Delta Quadrant.

Voyager's crew wisens up a bit.  The HoloDoc gets a boost and can now appear in spaces other than the medical bay.  Neelix and Kes are definitely ""real crew"" by now and the Maquis have assimilated into Voyager's crew better than a being within a Borg.

Captain Janeway does her best to keep her crew positive and happy.  A miserable crew, and I know this from experience, makes for a VERY long voyage.  Star Trek Voyager has a long, long way to go.

2022695,3,B0001NBNFW,"Many people criticize this season as being the worst of the Voyager series.  Personally, I think Season 1 was the worst, but this season suffers from the exact same problems:
1.  The dull-witted Kazon are still the main villains, albeit with Seska manipulating them.  But I never found Seska to be THAT dangerous of a villain.  It was an attempt to create a rival villain for Chakotay, but the lame attempts at dramatizing the conflict and those stupid Kazons muck it up.
2.  Voyager is STILL hopelessly lost in space.  Never cared for it.  Heck, there's an episode where Voyager literally had the chance to go home through a wormhole, but they just sit there like idiots and try to capture the Ferengi ship.  FORGET THE FERENGI SHIP!  GO HOME!!!
3.  Several episodes were downright strange.  Janeway and Tom mutating and evolving millions of years and mating, Kes becomes a psycho (pun-intended), while Saspiria, the Caretaker's mate from the 1st season makes her one and ONLY appearance in the series.  Really??!!!

The doctor's character develops very well.  I love Chakotay and Janeway's relationship maturing.  They come to grips that they can't have a relationship in their given circumstances.  Very realistic.  I still don't care for Kes; no wonder she gets written off after Season 3.  Neelix gets too much flack.  I really like the guy.  He's the only one that uplifts the spirit of the people.  Again, the series lacks a good villain.  In every story, you got to have a villain that creates conflict.  That's creates good drama.  The Q episode was good.  Always love Q.  Missed him in the DS9 series (he did have 1 episode though).

Overall, if I could give it 2 1/2 stars, I would.  This season's fair, and has a LOT of flaws.  But since I can't I give it 3 for at least being better than the 1st season.",1423094400,,1816,4.658227848101266

2022701,2,B0001NBNFW,"Hoh boy, is this one a doozy...

""Voyager"" is my favorite TV series by far. But this is also it's worst season, by far.

Season 2 does have *some* good episodes. But it also has the notorious ""Threshold"" (which may be a bonus, if you like watching bad episodes for laughs); some bad writing decisions for certain characters; a few clumsy attempts at dramatic story arcs, oh, and the friggin' Kazon.

One problem with Season 2 could be that the writers weren't sure if they wanted to make an episodic sci-fi show like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" or a serial drama in space like ""Deep Space Nine,"" shot for a mid-ground, and instead seemed to play tug-of-war between those two styles. The result is a season that contains some episodes that are good on their own, but when watched all in order, tell a very erratic, inconsistent story.

I have such mixed feelings about Season 2 that I'm gonna break it down into sections. I have to get my thoughts organized, or this review will end up an erratic mess, like the season it's reviewing.

STORY ARCS:

The first arc we get is the looming threat of Seska, the Cardassian spy who betrayed ""Voyager"" to join the Kazon...an arc that, frankly,should have begun in late Season 1, when Seska actually made that betrayal. For some reason, the entire crew immediately forgets that there's a Cardassian spy out there among Voyager's enemies, with intimate knowledge of the ship and crew, until the middle of Season 2 when she shows up again in ""Maneuvers."" After that episode, the writers do a pretty good shop of making it clear that Seska is a looming threat, and showing that the crew of Voyager is always aware she's out there. But what they didn't do as good of a job with was...

...the ""Chakotay's son"" arc. SPOILER: Seska steals some of Chakotay's ""DNA"" and impregnates herself with it. Why does she do this? Not only is that question never answered, but none of the characters even ask it. Even Chakotay doesn't question it. Nothing indicates it would be in Seska's best interests to have a baby at this time, least of all with her sworn enemy. Chakotay is clearly devastated to learn that the woman he despises is carrying his child...until the next episode when he completely forgets about it. The baby is hardly if ever mentioned for the rest of the season, even in scenes where Seska is discussed, or when she's *shown,* and visibly pregnant. I recall *one* episode where Seska brings up the fact that the baby is Chakotay's. Anyone who hadn't seen ""Maneuvers"" would have no idea that Chakotay has anything to do with Seska's pregnancy, or even with Seska herself. Well, in the end, SPOILER, it turns out that the baby wasn't Chakotay's after all. Which is probably a very good thing, given what a forgetful parent Chakotay apparently would have been.

Seriously, what were the writers going for here? Did they plan on giving Chakotay a child to raise  throughout the series, a la Worf? Or were they going to kill the baby off in order to create ""drama"" for him (as some of the writers claim)? Who knows. Whatever they were planning, they changed their minds and un-did it. It was one arc they clearly didn't think through.

Story arc #3 is Michael Jonas, a treacherous crewman played by Raphael Sbarge, who ""Once Upon a Time"" fans will recognize as Archie Hopper/Jimmeny Cricket. Jonaes basically does exactly what Seska did back in Season 1, except this time, the writers aren't saving the spy motif for a surprise twist; now it's an ongoing arc. And by ""ongoing arc,"" I mean that ""Voyager"" continues being a mostly episodic ""Star Trek"" series, but every other episode will have a few Jonas scenes shoehorned in, showing him in his dimly-lit quarters, talking to a random Kazon on a desktop monitor. This arc has a good climax in ""Investigations,"" but until then, it's just kind of there.

Arc #4: Tom Paris. Tom's behavioral problems increase throughout Season 2, until SPOILER it's revealed that it was all an act. Tom was only pretending to be a jerk, as part of an elaborate scheme to catch Jonas. Was this really the plan from the beginning? Or was all the Tom drama meant to be ""real"" until the writers changed their mind, like the arc with Chakotay's baby? Well, ""Investigations"" is a good enough episode that it doesn't matter too much.

Overall, the ""Voyager"" writers got much better at this sort of thing in later seasons, where the story arcs were more subtle, and blended better into the episodic style of the show.

QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER WRITING:

This is one of my biggest problems with Season 2. Chakotay and B'Elanna Torres, while having some great moments in the season, are at their very worst here. Neelix is also at his worst, and I don't recall him having any great moments (no, not even in ""Investigations,"" or any other episode that tried to make him seem ""badass."")

In Season 1, Chakotay was a former Maquis militant and Federation officer, who just happened to be Native American. Albeit a rather stereotypical one; but, his heritage was just one part of his character. Now in Season 2, he dips into major stereotyping territory. Look, I am not Native American, and I don't know anyone who is; but I've met a few, and they do NOT talk like Chakotay does in half these episodes, unless maybe the date is 4/20. Chakotay sounds stoned off his ass during a lot of moments that are meant to be serious. Luckily, Chakotay puts down the peace pipe early in Season 3, and remains mostly sober for the rest of the series.

As for B'Elanna, her character is given great attention in Season 2, but for some reason, the writers forgot that she was half-Klingon. They focus on B'Elanna the Engineer in this season, over B'Elanna the hybrid, and that's fine; but they should still have remembered that she *was* a hybrid. The effects of having Klingon adrenaline and mood swings are clearly indicated in Season 1, but in Season 2 they're abandoned. B'Elanna sighs with despair during moments that, in any other season, she would be grinding her teeth and shouting sarcastic quips at. In some episodes, she becomes such a delicate, winded-speaking damsel, one wonders why Kes isn't asking to be her best friend.

Most jarring is B'Elanna's reaction to Seska, who was once her best friend, and turned out to be the thing B'Elanna hates most (Cardassians). One would think there would be a lot of rage between these two, and some very juicy opportunities for confrontations--especially with both of them being engineering geniuses, and hailing from vicious, war-like alien races...but not only do Seska and B'Elanna never go to battle in any sense, but B'Elanna acts downright benign about Seska's betrayal, talking about the Cardassian spy as if she's just a mildly annoying and amusing subject of town gossip.

In Season 3, B'Elanna's Klingon rage will return (without explanation), and her character development will be consistent and fantastically done for the rest of the series.

Then there's Neelix. Already the least popular character, Neelix is at rock bottom in this season. People who do like Neelix tend to be people who focus on the later season of ""Voyager,"" and indeed, Neelix is a lot more likable then. In Season 2, he's obnoxious and selfish, and his relationship with Kes boarders on abusive. The writers claim they were going for a ""beauty and the beast"" tale with Neelix and Kes; but instead, one gets the impression of a piggish middle-aged man with a naive, young, foreign mail-order bride, who hooked up with him because he was her ticket out of a hell-hole, and who stays with him because she thinks she ""owes"" him. As with Chakotay and B'Elanna, Neelix will get better in later seasons, and Kes will finally leave him.

THE KAZON:

...are the lamest villains of any TV series, ever. The Mooninites from ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" are more threatening. The Kazon are ugly to look at, horribly acted, dumber than villains from a Saturday morning cartoon, and we're supposed to believe that they're one of the greatest threats a Federation ship with Maqius allies could face. Ugh. Just take comfort in the fact that the Kazon will not only be gone by the next season, but the writers will poke fun at how lame they really were, in an episode where Seven of Nine reveals that the Borg considered the Kazon ""unworthy of assimilation.""

""THRESHOLD""

There's not much I can say that you won't find in a hundred other reviews of this turkey of an episode. All I'll say is, if you're the kind of person who laughs at horrendously absurd plot twists, you may want to check this out. But be warned, this is the episode that launched the Janeway/Paris crack-pairing among fanfic writers...and I'll just leave it at that.

GOOD (WELL ENTERTAINING) EPISODES TO WATCH FOR:

*  ""Projections"" Reg Barclay makes his ""Voyager"" debut, and the Doctor--the most popular character on the show--makes bounds in his character development.

*  ""Deadlock:"" One of the best episodes of the series. Naomi Wildman is born, but under initially tragic, and ultimately bizarre circumstances. This is also worth a watch just for the brilliantly weird sci-fi story, of a ship and crew being split into two copies of themselves.

*  ""Lifesigns:"" The Doctor must treat a comatose Vidiian woman, who is herself a scientist. He downloads her consciousness into a hologram so she can help find her own cure, and the two begin to get close... This episode provides a sympathetic look at the Vidiians, and features a great guest-character in Dennara Pel. Any fan of the Doctor should see it.

*  ""Elogium:"" Kes eats bugs, while space-dwelling tadpoles try to make love to the starship Voyager (seriously)

""Non Sequitur:"" The Dweeb gets an episode to shine, when a race of highly-evolved trans-dimensional Italians sends him to an alternate timeline where he never left Earth

*  ""Twisted:"" A space anomaly turns Voyager into a warped labyrinth (sadly, without any David Bowie music).

*  ""Persistence of Vision:"" Kes kills Neelix, while B'Elanna shags Chakotay. (But sadly, in both cases, only in an illusion.)

*  ""Cold Fire:"" Kes actually steps outside her Mary Sue bubble for once, and experiments with some very dangerous mental powers.

*  ""Maneuvers:"" Chakotay reminds Seska that he still knows how to kick ass.

*  ""Meld:"" Tuvok does a mind-meld with Brad Douriff, and spends the rest of the series going insane every other week. In all seriousness though, this is a brilliant episode featuring one of ""Voyager's"" best one-shot characters--Lon Suder--played by a brilliant actor, Brad Douriff (who you may know as Grima Wormtongue from ""Lord of the Rings,"" Chucky from ""Child's Play,"" and Zoso the Dark One from ""Once Upon a Time."")

*  ""Dreadnought:"" B'Elanna must defeat a sentient weapon of war that she herself programed.

*  ""Death Wish:"" Q makes his ""Voyager"" debut, along with a new Q, and the issue of euthanasia is examined.

*  ""The Thaw:"" The CLOWN. That is all.

*  ""Tuvix:"" What starts off as a bad joke turns into one of the most serious and widely-discussed episodes of the saga.

*  ""Basics, Part I:"" Voyager begins its final battle with Seska...

BAD EPISODES, TO EITHER AVOID, OR WATCH FOR LAUGHS:

*  ""Threshold:"" Tom Paris breaks the Warp 10 barrier, and begins to transform into a grotesque being, which ultimately takes the form of....an orange salamander. Then he turns Janeway into a salamander, and they have three salamander babies. Think I'm making this up? Watch it. And prepare to cry (either from despair, or laughter).

*  ""Parturition:"" Tom and Neelix become gay daddies to an orphaned dinosaur baby. Guest-staring the most terrifying puppet-reptile seen since...that one '80s show with the terrifying puppet dinosaurs.

*  ""Tattoo:"" Widely considered the most racist episode in all of ""Star Trek,"" this is where we learn that (1) Chakotay is officially not from any real Indian tribe that ever existed, unless you're really good at getting around plot-holes, (2) Native Americans had no culture until crackers from outer space brought them one, and (3) in the 24th century, it will apparently be a problem for a Native American to pursue a career in science and maintain his culture at the same time, even though no other character in the melting-pot cast of ""Star Trek"" has a problem with that, in this utopia society.

*  ""Prototype:"" B'Elanna helps regenerate a race of primitive robots that look like something out of ""Metropolis."" If you don't mind major camp, this episode isn't ""bad"" per se, just....really, really weird.

*  ""Alliances:"" Yuck. No. Attempt at ""drama"" gone horribly wrong. It focuses on the Kazon. And Neelix. Enough said!

* ""Resolutions."" It's telling that Jeri Taylor and most of the JC fandom think this episode is so fantastic. Never mind how boring and cliche and trite it is, I hate it for the way it mercilessly slaughters the characters of both Janeway and Chanktay. It's insulting. For a decent JC episode watch Season 3's ""Coda.""

VERDICT:

2022740,1,B0001NBNFW,"HORRIBLE episode, probably the worst in the entire Star Trek franchise, almost as bad as STNG ""Genesis"" (although I'm just now going through all of the Voyager episodes, but I can't imagine anything getting worse than this).  It started with so much potential, then devolved (literally) into the stupidest storyline ever.  Going warp 10 makes Paris and Janeway ""evolve"" into....anphibians????  This is an evolutionary step up?  I don't recall Q being a fish, or the creatures from STNG ""The Nth Degree"" being slimy amphibians.  Even the caretaker from the first episode was...well he was a blob, but a shiny glowing blob that at least had technology and could make himself look human.  But an amphibian?  Sorry it's just so bad.  And of course, at the end of the episode they're completely back to normal with no sign that anything even happened...the holographic doctor just fixed them like fixing a broken arm.  It didn't surprise me to learn that the same producer made both this episode and ""Genesis"".  Ugh!",1409011200,,1011,4.964285714285714

2022763,5,B0001NBNFW,"Voyager's second season combined everything we like about Star Trek and took it to new heights. This season is, in my mind, the show's best; it is certainly the last one where the writers had any kind of focus as to what was going to happen on the show. One great episode after another is what this season delivered, along with a deeper sense of the crew of this little ship, not to mention fantastic science-fiction. What more could a fan ask for?

2022781,3,B0001NBNFW,"First, let me state for the record that I'm more of a Next Gen girl than Original Series.

Voyager is pretty good, although the second season is a little weak.  In this season more than the others it felt like every other episode was ""Janeway has to decide between honoring her values (and/or Federation rules) and finding a solution to get them home faster.""  It got a little repetitive.

However, I still like Voyager better than Deep Space Nine, which is my least favorite of all the Star Treks. Here the characters are all pretty likable, and the good part about season 2 is we start to see more characterization as the the crew bonds more.

The first season and third season I would rate 4 stars, but was not crazy about this one.",1397865600,,735,4.455223880597015

2022861,5,B0001NBNFW,"I am a super fan of Star Trek since Original Series.  I love Star Trek Original Series, New Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  An of course, ALL THE MOVIES that I have bought in Blu Ray.

Actually, the complete seasons are very expensive in Blu Ray.  So I have to see the series in low resolution in Instant Video.  It doesn't make me very happy but anyway, someday I will have the entire collections of series in Full HD or maybe better in 4K on line.  It is funny how I used to record the TV chapters in VHS, very ugly image, the the DVD arrived and the image came better and now I can't see DVD.  Ugly in my opinion.  But, I really don't know if 4K will have 4 times resolution.  I know that FULL HD is really a big step toward the perfection of the imagen, but 4K, I have to investigate more deeply about this matter.  The thing is that I have bought VHS, DVD, BLU RAY.  Then 4K is emerging.  The same movies again and again.  But, I am a fan of star trek, so I will continue making rich the studios.

SEVEN OF NINE, ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS EVER (MY HUMBLE OPINION)
From the 4 season and beyond, they introduce in the chapter SCORPION, one the best chapters I have ever seen: Seven of Nine (full Borg designation: Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01) was a Human female who was a former Borg drone. She was born Annika Hansen on stardate 25479 (2350), the daughter of eccentric exobiologists Magnus and Erin Hansen. She was assimilated by the Borg in 2356 at age six, along with her parents, but was liberated by the crew of the USS Voyager in 2374. She joined the crew and returned to the Alpha Quadrant with the starship in 2378.

After being cast, actress Jeri Ryan acknowledged she had hardly even seen Star Trek, and had no idea what the Borg were. To prepare her, the producers gave her a copy of Star Trek: First Contact and the Star Trek Encyclopedia.[1]

In an interview with Michael Logan, Ryan told TV Guide that the high, stiff collar had pressed against her carotid artery and caused her to pass out, so the lower neckline was a necessity.[10] She said in a 2012 interview that the suit by costume designer Robert Blackman was a ""feat of engineering"", but required a 20-minute production shutdown if she needed to use the toilet, as she needed that time plus assistance to get into and out of it.[11]

""RESISTANCE IS FUTILE""
The Borg are a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones of the Collective, or the hive.

The Borg manifest as cybernetically enhanced humanoid drones of multiple species, organized as an interconnected collective, the decisions of which are made by a hive mind, linked by subspace radio. The Borg inhabit a vast region of space in the Delta Quadrant of the galaxy, possessing thousands of vessels. They operate toward the fulfilment of one purpose: to ""add the biological and technological distinctiveness of other species to [their] own... [in pursuit of] perfection"". The concept of perfection is the unifying idea at the core of the Borg. The pursuit of an unemotional, mechanical perfection is the Borg's only motivation. This is achieved through forced assimilation, a process which takes individuals and technology, enhancing and controlling them.

Individual Borg rarely speak. Instead they send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that ""resistance is futile"", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be assimilated and its ""biological and technological distinctiveness"" will be added to their own.",1389225600,,3566,4.704180064308682
2022862,5,B0001NBNFW,"I have seen all of the Star Treck series and this is the best one, in my opinion. Get it.",1388966400,,89,3.5
2022863,5,B0001NBNFW,"Since the creation of Star Trek starting with the original series, there has always been very good story plots and visual effects. Voyager was a nice rebound from the slow and lacking Deep Space 9 series which centered on a space station and really did not have much of a plot in my opinion. Voyager is of the same concept as STOS and Next Gen. ""Have starship, will travel!"" this leads to a vast array of possible plots and adventures for the crew. If you love Sci - Fi this is a must!",1388793600,,485,4.225806451612903

2022865,5,B0001NBNFW,"Jan. 1st, 2014  4:22am  I like the STAR TREK VOYAGER's BETTER than all the STAR TREK Series!!!
 I like All The  STAR TREK VOYAGER Series! I watch The Whole SERIES OVER and OVER AGAIN! I Like the Crew, and the story lines!!!  It is good to see that they had a Woman to be in Charge-The Captain  and she plays the Role very good as the commander leading her crew  in every episode trying to get them all back home again!!!  I am working on purchasing The Whole Series!!!!  I do believe some parts in some of the Series Young Children should not watch, because of the scary looking creatures they encounter and could give them nightmares as well as all the killings that go on!!!
To me it is refreshing not to hear vulgar words!!!!  Most producers think that such words make the shows / series a big hit!!!! Not me!!! This is why I do not watch nor want to buy many videos, because of the language, nudity!!!!  And I Like that VOYAGER Does Not have these such things!!!!! Thank You  For allowing me to  Express myself about The Voyager SEIRES Season 2",1388534400,,1048,4.312820512820513
2022866,5,B0001NBNFW,Voyager has been one of my favorite Star Trek series next to the Next Generation.  Works great watching on Amazon Prime on my Ipad.,1388275200,,131,4.458333333333333
2022867,5,B0001NBNFW,A truly engaging cast of very good actors bolstered by some very engrossing storylines as well as some of the best writers of any television show!,1388275200,,146,4.653846153846154
2022868,5,B0001NBNFW,"I wasn't so sure I liked ""Voyager""--not a bad cast except I, too, subscribed to the ""Neelix Hate Anti-Fan Magazine"" just like everyone else did, first season. And how does he gets one of the prettiest girls on the ship (until Seven of Nine shows up?) The doctor stops being annoying, Neelix gets hybridized to Tuvok (who can't stand his guts--or his cooking most of the time) and the two of them ARE pretty cool together until ""Tuvix"" gets all whiny and manipulative. Captain Janeway stops being the cool science-office-promoted-to-captain and becomes the hot captain-turned-science-officer in ""Resolutions."" She and Chakotay have some good chemistry going on there. Real good.

The only issue I continue to have with Voyager is that bad aliens have bad hair. It's apparently a law of the Delta Quadrant that if you are mean, nasty and trouble, you can't do a THING with your hair. Or else it's because Federation technology must not being shared due to the Prime Directive. No advanced Federation weapons and above all, no Brazilian blow-outs.",1388188800,,1044,5.0

2022910,5,B0001NBNFW,"Voyager is my favourite Star Trek series, so naturally I have been slowly building my collection.

These boxsets look nice, and the DVDs are relatively easy to get to.  The box itself is encased in a kind of dual plastic sleeve.  You remove the top part of the clear sleeve, and the lower part had the big graphic that covers the discs so it looks nice.  You can slide the box out from there, and it actually opens like a book which is nice.  Each disc has its own 'page' Each set is a differently coloured plastic, but the plastic itself might be seen as flimsy and might break easily.  If you take care of your things though, this shouldn't be a problem.  My outer plastic shell has gotten its share of scratches and dings from moving and normal usage, and I find it can sometimes be a bit frustrating to get the box back into it, due to the lip at the bottom it refuses to slide into.  (Much like getting that last card into a deck of cards) The back of the sleeve does show an episode list as well.

The menu is full on Star Trek, and has an animated intro, I was not disappointed.  The last disk also has a bunch of special features too!  It's overall a nice boxset, and I would recommend it to any Voyager fan!",1382486400,,1216,4.175965665236052
2022911,3,B0001NBNFW,I give this a 3 star rating only because there are so many bogus copies of voyager sets on amazon.  You will know the real deal if it is in a 2 piece package that splits in the middle leaving the round cover picture with the disc set. Also the discs will have the episode and air dates around the center hole. The discs are in a hard plastic binder type case with different colors for each season. The back will also list the episodes. Make sure you contact the seller and get a detailed description of the disc and packaging before ordering. The set that I received from speedkingbooks for season 3 came in a shiny cardboard box that when opened you slip off another plain brown cardboard cover to find the discs in the center of the cardboard holder in a flimsy binder type slip cover. Also the discs do not have the episodes in the center of the disc and episodes are not listed on the back cover.  The seller offerd me a refund but still insists that in is not bogus and at this point from his email it reads like taking down my 1 star rating is a pre-condition for said refund .I have not gotten a response back to that question but that is how it read to me.  BEWARE save yourself some grief and contact the seller.  If you are a collector of Trek then you won't want the knockoff.  I'm not a collector and I don't want it. Hate seeing voyager jerk it's way thru space. Good Luck,1382140800,2,1385,4.19172932330827

2022938,5,B0001NBNFW,"I am a star Trek fan, so it is no surprise that I like ST:Voyager.  What this show it not about is your typical missions that both ST: Next Generation or ST: Deep Space Nine shows you in each episode.  Set in the same time frame as both of the previously mentioned shows, this crew (lead by Kathryn Janeway), is trying to get back to the Alpha Quadrant, or we will call Earth.  They encounter new species, new worlds, as they explore the Delta Quadrant.

There are some things that I have found annoying for this crew for this season:
The Kazon (They look like one of the Yu-gh-Yo  Characters), live to dominate when the ship first lands in their part of the Delta Quadrant.  By season 2, they are out of Voyager's hair, or are they?
 The vidiian-  This race lives to harvest organs of other beings in order to save their own race.  there are two bright spots where a Vidiian named Denara Pel actually help out the crew.

I hope that they will all be available for a long time to come.

2023062,5,B0001NBNFW,I really like Star Trek Voyager -  I think there is a connection with being 'Lost' in the Delta Quadrant and being free of the ever-present Star Fleet Command -  Their humanity is not lost and the relationships that develop are natural and believable.  The Borg symbolize WWII and have them question many things we take  for granted - especially things we are taught in school.

2023068,5,B0001NBNFW,"In Season two of Voyager we find the crew continuing their journey home while upholding their Starfleet principles.  Relationships grow deeper, and the high point for me was Tom Paris' crush on Kes before he and Bellana get together.  Even though I liked Tom and Bellana,  I felt that Tom and Kes made a better couple.  It's a shame the writers didn't pursue their relationship, since Bellana  was verbally abusive to Tom at times.  My favorite episodes of the season was Twisted, Persistance of Vision, and one of my all time favorites and saddest episodes of the whole series Deadlock.

2023073,5,B0001NBNFW,"The series progresses in Season Two. In this season we see the Voyager crew go through a number of adventures. They stem from just being in a strange, unknown part of the galaxy as well as fighting a new adversary they made along the way-the Kazon. Also the Voyager crew are dealing with a race called the Vidiian's-a race that steals body organs from other and all life forms.

At this point the Federation and Maquis crews have intergrated and are working together. But all is not well. It will be determined that there is a spy on Voyager that's sending information to the Kazon. The spy will be found out and revealed by rather unorthodox methods.

One big event on this season is a baby is born on Voyager. Ensign Samantha Wildman will give birth to a baby girl who will be named Naomi Wildman. The infant is a mixed species: Human/Ktarian. This will cause her to grow and mature rapidly, more so than an all human child. Throughout the series Naomi Wildman will have visible roles and I will add that she is a sweetheart.

The season will end with a cliffhanger. On the final episode of Season Two Voyager will be taken over by the Kazon. The crew will be forced off Voyager and left stranded on a planet. Voyager flies off and the crew encounters humanoid lifeforms. At this point it is not known if they are friendly or hostile. The episode ends with the words ""to be continued"". The second part will be seen on Season Three.

It would take me a while to watch all the discs. There were no problems with the discs. Also Amazon did its usual good job in getting the items to me in a timely manner.

I liked this episode as it contained some action and it provided insights into the Kazon way of life.  It is a good episode for Chakotay who is one on the better characters in the crew and he does a good job in this episode showing his maturity and leadership to a young Kazon warrior in training.

The ship is surrounded by the creatures and major parts of the Voyagers control systems and propulsion systems stop working.  Another effect is that Kes begins puberty and she is only 2 years old and much too young to have a child but the desire to do so overwhelm her.  Neelix is conflicted as he doesn't know if he wants to be a father and he is perplexed as to what he has to offer a child, especially if it is a girl.....

This season of Star Trek has several episodes that are politically motivated or trying to teach life lessons to the viewers.  This is one of them and it focuses on the role of a woman and her career and the art of parenting a child.  Making decisions about bringing a child into the world is a serious choice to make and this episode addresses some of the possible consequences and concepts.

I gave this episode a 3 star rating as I am not a fan of Neelix and his role in this season is not enjoyable to me as I believe his character simply acts silly most of the time.  I also don't watch Star Trek to get a political lesson or a lesson on ethics, I watch it for entertainment.  This episode to me was not that interesting and is about a 2  stars.

2023131,5,B0001NBNFW,"I see others have deemed this episode rather uneventful. True, no combat, no crazy magic science, no body switching voodoo aliens, but Star Trek has always been about humanity and a dialogue of sociological ideals. This one is no different. The episode addresses very real and present day (I'm not even talking about the 90s, but today, 2012) issues regarding women's rights to reproduction and gender-based parenthood.

***SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON!

It didn't occur to me until Neelix asks Kes how she'll continue her medical studies if she has a child. Kes replies with certainty that this isn't an issue. It is, however, a real challenge that women have been facing for the last few decades, and still do. Sure, we can make babies when we want now (unless you live in some backwardy place), but women are still largely considered the one responsible for childcare. Fathers are not criticized if they favor work over childcare, but women are. The fact that this issue was brought up, but dismissed as an illegitimate excuse suggests that in our ideal future, women's careers need not be sacrificed if they choose to have children. This is further discussed when both Kes and Tuvok confront Neelix, on separate occasions, about HIS responsibilities as a parent. Neelix obviously represents conservative ideas about parenthood, and the fact that his mind was changed in the end empathizes the power to change traditional thoughts with... well, rational thoughts like Tuvok's.

Also, when Neelix is startled by the idea of having a daughter, saying he doesn't know what to teach a girl, Tuvok reminds him that the values a parent teaches should not depend on the gender of the child. Ground. Breaking. What other show can you think of that addresses gendered child raising this head-on!? In a culture where toy stores are separated into pink and blue, we could certainly use the reminder.

Lastly, there's the contrast: Kes finally decides it's the wrong time because she's not ready to be a mother, and she wants the best for their child; At the same time, another crew member confronts Janeway about her pregnancy and decides to have her child (without the dad present might I add!!!) and both decisions were respected. They chose what they wanted to do with their bodies. They were not forced by a community with rules or laws that dictate what they can do with their own bodies. Holy crap (looking at you, Arizona). Perhaps this was softened by the fact that Kes wasn't already pregnant. Nevertheless, her power to be respected based on her choice is worth noting.

***END SPOILER

There were many other tidbits that I'm not pointing out, but I assure you, every sentence these characters spoke were deliberate. The fact that other reviewers have not even noticed the message about women's issues is probably intended. There shouldn't be a big brouhaha about letting women decide what to do with their own bodies on TV or anywhere else. Under the guise of science fiction, Star Trek has snuck in SO many present day social issues into the mainstream, and this episode has done it well. Call me a weirdo but I find social issues just as intriguing as magic voodoo aliens.

Interestingly, I think some conservative politicians involved in the 2012 election would be appalled by how much power these women have. Old ideas die hard I guess.",1348099200,,3341,4.881834215167548

2023151,3,B0001NBNFW,"Star Trek Voyager was the first Star Trek franchise I never bothered to finish. I even watched all 4 seasons of Enterprise on Netflix. However, Voyager just never rose beyond a mediocrity. The whole premise was that the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from home, but we never actually see any implications of this. There is almost no tension amongst the crew, no divisions, no infighting. Starfleet discipline is maintained even when it doesn't make sense. Very few families or deep relationships forming, something absolutely impossible in such close quarters. The show could have gone off in an interesting direction, but instead became a more action-oriented Next Generation.

Given that the producers decided to take the show in an episodic rather than serial format, the show needed something other than the plotline to make it interesting. However, the crew is for the most part an utterly boring bunch. Katherine Janeway is fine as the ship's captain, emanating a motherly concern for the crew, but can't hold a candle to Captains Picard or Sisko. The holographic doctor is ironically the most interesting and entertaining character. He provides much-needed humor. However, the rest of the crew shows little to no character development. They're usually relegated to restating the obvious.

Voyager was partly a victim of more cynical viewer attitudes in the late 1990s and the rise of reality TV. However, Voyager also failed on its own grounds. Coming after TNG and DS9, Voyager needed to more than just another Star Trek. At least in this season, we got an interesting villain in Seska (Cardassians always make the best villains).",1346284800,,1652,5.114814814814815
2023152,2,B0001NBNFW,"I'm not sure what triggered it.  But Season 2 went so far in the wrong direction it had to be based on some feedback from someone or a change of command somewhere.

In the first season, it was obvious that the writers were trying to lay the foundation for future stories.  The Seska storyline is explored further in Season 2 which is a good thing, but then they have episodes that do more harm than good.  ""Initiations"" and ""Tattoo"" are designed to give Chakotay some character development (which was needed), but only end up boring the watcher, especially ""Tattoo"" which has no business in Star Trek canon.  ""Threshold"" has the right idea but then goes the wrong direction, not just with The Doctor being able to reverse evolution itself but also creating a history-making event that is then forgotten by all.

""Dreadnought"" is an episode that shouldn't even be possible, given the reason Voyager was even in the Delta Quadrant.  ""False Profits"" feels like a bone to people who yearned for familiar species.

There are some good episodes in Season 2.  Beyond the Seska storyline episodes, ""Meld"" is one of the more interesting stories that has two parts.  First, Tuvok finds a murderer that has no logical motive, which conflicts with his Vulcan sensibilities.  This sets up ""Basics"", the two-part episode that resulted in the loss of the ship, and managed to create more character development for the murderer than had ever been seen previously.  The story blurred the black-white nature of the Prime Directive by showing that even the worst person has value under the right circumstances.  But if nothing else, ""Meld"" shows just how good an actor Tim Russ really is (I would love to see him, Avery Brooks and Tony Todd in something together), and ""Basics"" shows how polarizing Brad Dourif is in such a role as Lon Suder.

Season 2's problem was that it had too many diamonds in the rough.  There were a lot of filler and boring episodes in the season which made it extremely difficult to pick out the important ones.  It shouldn't be avoided, but compared to the other seasons, this was one of the worst in the history of Star Trek.

As a side note - what the hell was Amazon thinking with ""Alliances"" and that fake clapping and cheering when the Kazon leaders enter the conference??",1345939200,,2286,4.732323232323233

And so Voyager is forced to go on without them on Janeway's order, and she specifically instructs them to not attempt to find a cure again.

A very interesting episode indeed; perhaps a bit far fetched, but the performances are what make this 5 star worthy. There is an especially touching heartfelt monologue given by Chakotay when both Janeway and he discover their hidden feelings (it's at around 37 mins). It comes at the perfect time, and it just felt right. Shame we never get to see what comes of it, but the mystery is half the fun :)

He doesn't even like Paris, but now in this episode he acts like they are frat bros or something.

  Aside from personal views on Neelix there were a lot of plot holes in the ""twist"" here as well. Important information that could cause the destruction of Voyager is withheld from high ranking officers FOR MONTHS so Janeway can play spy vs spy? Wow, that sounds like a 12 year old not a captain making rational decisions. A serious dip in quality here for me. Especially considering how phenomenal the past few episodes have been.

I mainly attribute this to Janeway, and her lack of chemistry on screen with the Q's. There was just something about her performance in this episode that annoyed me to tears. I think it's cause most of the time she is doing ""The Rock"" eyebrow stare as a substitute for acting. And you see a lot of that here because almost everyone else is absent (no B'Elanna, Chakotay, Kes, Paris, etc)

But my personal nit-picking aside it's still enjoyable and I recommend watching it. Also to anyone who thinks this is an amazing episode also go watch the TNG Q episodes....they will probably blow your socks off all the way to the delta quadrant.",1341532800,,881,4.5

2023162,4,B0001NBNFW,"I have some issues with it which I will address here, but I recommend you watch it before reading the rest of my review.

1. It is never made clear how the missile also ended up in the delta quadrant...they just make a very generous assumption and went on with the plot...I mean what are the chances that missile is in the same exact spot as Voyager 70k LY away from where it started?

2. Why wasn't any of this supreme Cardassian Tech used in the Alpha quadrant more? They would have demolished the Federation and Klingon in 1 second during the Founder's War (DS9)

3. There is no logic to why the missile confirms an incorrect target as a planet that is 70k LY away. Any weapon with that much destructive capabilities would auto abort if it couldn't confirm the EXACT TARGET in it's EXACT position. And if sensors begun to fail nobody in their right mind would program it to act on assumptions and speculations. i.e. If our government fired a Nuclear Missile at Russia we wouldn't give it a mind of it's own to say ""oh well we were aiming for Russia, but Hawaii is close enough"" *KA-BOOM* goodbye completely wrong target

Perhaps because I program Flash and C++ for a living these things get on my nerves, but I think even Joe Schmo can see how many holes are in this episode. I still enjoyed it, but I guess I expect more out of Star Trek.

This one is a no brainier really; it's just that good. I've found out what I love most about Star Trek: every episode is a mini mystery.

Only downside was they didn't have the budget to show us the cities :(

2023204,4,B0001NBNFW,"I do not think this is a bad episode at all.
The problem with this episode is that it is very confusing, and makes assumptions that the viewer knows much about what is already going on in Star Trek history during this time frame.

To start out, realize that a warp rating is not a defined set in stone number.  it is not like miles or kilometers per hour.  They basically take several actual speeds on a graph from Zero times Light Speed to Infinity times Light Speed.  At this point in time, and established before this Voyager episode, the current Warp rating used puts warp 0 at one side, and 10 on the other.  In certain other times and alternate time lines in other shows, this rating was not used, and people assume just because the word was ""warp"" it must be the same thing.

The problem was, they never thought they'd get really really fast, so 0 to 10 sounded like a good idea (used in this episode)... originally it was just the number times the speed of light, before a formal rating system was made... they didn't want people to have to worry about saying ""warp 203"" or ""warp 5000"" so they made a rating scale that keep the numbers lower.  Later in history slightly after Voyager time, this started getting hard to do because it caused the same problem but with decimals.  Warp 9.99 9.9975 9.9998734 9.99999937838  is ridiculous too.  Later on they redefined Warp ratings differently and could start using numbers higher than 10, but that was only a change in numbers used for reference, not actual speed!!!

In this episode, the 0 to 10 scale is still being used, so when they say warp 10, they are referring to Infinity times the speed of light.  This is not the same as transwarp which is a different technology altogether... and its not the same as slipstream either.. and many different things.",1327881600,2,1811,4.521472392638037

This is one of those episodes I would have skipped, as I think it might be my least favorite episode of any Star Trek episode ever,(with the exception of the entire ""Enterprise"" series), but I decided to sit through it because I couldn't remember how it ended. This is my second night with my new TV from Amazon - [...] which is an amazing TV, and I was happy I could really take advantage of the Amazon Prime free movies and TV shows and watch some of my favorite series on a great TV. (I know I sound like a commercial) HOWEVER, though all I really wanted was to know how it ended, after sitting through the whole thing, just as it got to the climax, it starts to break up and was impossible to see or hear what happened.

I have had no problems with any other episodes other than a couple blips here and there, but this was not even something you could just sit through until it cleared up, it lost all audio and video.

The good news it that you can just skip this episode, and you might even have a better opinion of voyager overall for having missed it.

2023210,5,B0001NBNFW,"Apparently, the episode ""Threshold"" (ST: VOY, Season 2, Ep. 11) is regarded by many Star Trek fans as one of the worst episodes ever, and some fans have even gone so far as to suggest it be removed from the canon.  But this episode fulfills, as no other episode has, the optimistic vision of future evolution.  Tom Paris and Captain Janeway are mutated into the far future descendants of humanity into large mudpuppies, living what appears to be a serene life in warm swamp water and breeding happily in tropical jungle.  I can think of no better existence.  We once were very similar to the creatures portrayed in this episode, and I have always looked back on that existence with a mixture of envy and evolutionary regret.  We are now bipedal apes with swollen brains, filled with emotional and rational conflict.  The projection of our evolution into these creatures is one of the boldest adventures Star Trek has ever offered.  The optimism of such a future state of our species is compelling science fiction.  Usually, sci-fi, and especially Star Trek, suggests that we will evolve into beings of pure energy and consciousness after some intermediate version that incorporates technology into our biological being.  Instead, ""Threshold"" offers an alternative, more naturalistic, vision of returning to something much like what we once were hundreds of millions of years ago.  I find this alternative vision of our future evolution refreshing and optimistic in the extreme.  I would much rather be a mudpuppy than a manifestation of pure energy consciousness.  To breathe through my skin again and lie placidly in a warm swamp is the most optimistic future I can imagine.",1316044800,3,1675,5.007220216606498

2023212,4,B0001NBNFW,"Sometimes wrapping several months of a story into one neatly packaged 50 minute program doesn't work. In this case, the story occurs in two places involving a lot of elements - medicine, Videans, leaders, followers, emotions, and amazingly perfect solutions.

This episode is one of my all time favorites, but there are a few problems.  Janeway's interactions with an alien primate seem artificial; Tuvak's flawless, even for a Vulcan, execution of simultaneous bombing and beaming, and timing is also off - how do tomatoes grow from seedlings to full size plants in less than a week?  These nitty gritties always drive me nuts. The ending wrapped up fast and perfect, as if they'd run out of film to do it with the length of time it should have had.

On the other hand, we do not learn, for MANY more episodes to come, what level of intimancy Chakotay and Janeway achieve while marooned on the Planet of {almost} Eden.  The ending is poingnant when they are returned to Voyager's bridge and resume duties as if the last several months never occured.  It's of course open ended on purpose, but all the romantic tension drains away after that and leaves us wishing this side plot had continued. Their relationship is much more complex, and would have been delicious, compared to Neelix and Kess, Tom and B'Lanna, or Seven and Chakotay.

2023218,4,B0001NBNFW,"It's fitting that this season has an episode in which Voyager is duplicated, as this season demonstrated, perhaps better than any other, just how good or bad the show could be from episode to episode, especially in the early years.

Limiting my comments to just a few representative episodes: Voyager Season 2 has the much-maligned ""Threshold"" and the awful ""The Thaw."" These are truly Voyager at its worst: bad ideas, poorly executed. ""Threshold"" could have been good, as it begins with an interesting premise, but the show degenerates into sheer stupidity. Along with it, ""The Thaw"" starts lamely and stays that way throughout. These two are best put aside and forgotten.

On the other hand, the season closes with a very strong set of episodes. ""Tuvix"" explores an interesting idea and, though it could have been improved in some ways, nevertheless builds to a kind of morally ambiguous conclusion that is rarely seen in this series. Like the doctor, I don't agree with Captain Janeway's final decision, but I very much enjoyed watching her deal with it. If only these emotions had carried through to future episodes, there could have been some interesting ramifications.

""Resolutions"" is an interesting exploration of Janeway and Chakotay's relationship, and asks the question of whether desperately trying to return home has been the right choice for them and the Voyager crew. Again in this episode, the conclusion is bittersweet, and I think the show is all the better for it.

And the season finale, ""Basics, Part I,"" has a great conflict and genuine tension. The return of a nasty villain and the Voyager crew in a real predicament with a cliffhanger ending is the perfect formula to close out the season.

When Voyager first aired, I was frustrated by its weaknesses more than I am now. To my pleasant surprise, I think Voyager has aged rather well. Though the season begins somewhat weakly, and the ""Threshold"" and ""The Thaw"" episodes are terrible, there's much to enjoy. There are better seasons than this, but it's certainly worthwhile viewing, and I'm sure the finale will have you rushing to start on season 3.",1276387200,,2126,4.96067415730337

2023220,3,B0001NBNFW,"I want to say that as a Star Trek fan, I wasn't totally thrilled with Voyager when it originally aired. I found it lacking in comparison to the excellent Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 which I was watching at the same time. But now re-watching the series on DVD, I have come to really enjoy the adventures of the Voyager crew. The second season of Voyager moved us a little closer to the alpha quadrant and at the same time, expanded the story of the crew working together to find their way home.

Season 2 was a lot stronger than I remembered. After a slow and uneven start to the reason, the season really picked up with the episode RESISTANCE. This was a simple but effective and touching episode about oppression and the lengths the crew would go to get what they need to survive. Joel Grey was outstanding. MELD was a very interesting look into the mind of a killer that only Star Trek could pull off. DEATH WISH introduced Q to the series and had a very interesting argument presented. THE THAW was a very interesting take on making fear personified and it was capped off by an amazing ending. And TUVIX was another good argument, this time the right to life and put Janeway in a very tough position.

With the excellent episodes, I have to point out that there were many weak moments in the season. The whole Kazon/Jonas thing was very weak and it felt forced. It did not flow well as arcing stories did on DS9 or B5. I was kind of glad when the Jonas thread was over. THRESHOLD is usually on the top of the list of worst episodes and sadly, it came from this season. I didn't find it as bad as I remembered but it isn't very re-watchable. RESOLUTIONS was an excellent episode but it lost a huge opportunity in exploring a possible relationship between Janeway and Chakotay. They give it all but 5 minutes of screen time and more time should have been devoted to it. This episode screamed to be a 2 parter. As mentioned, the early 1/3 of the season was kind of weak and featured the worst of the season. Oh, and the amount of shuttle accidents are laughable. Finally, the whole spit crew story was pretty much a non-factor this season and pretty much totally dropped in seasons to come.

shows like Innocence ,  The Thaw, The 37's prototype, non sequitur, Meld, and the rest. Many give a chance to highlight of the stars which also gave us a chance to understand them a little more as the seasons advanced
Janeway, a cross between Kirk and Picard in how she Captains this lost ship makes the show worth watching, However the rest of the cast can not be dismissed.
this is when I started watching the show. It was truly a great addition to the Star trek franchise.  Now that they cut the price too be sure to add this to your  set. Its worth it watching

2023230,4,B0001NBNFW,"Star Trek was entering it's 30'th anniversary when Star Trek Voyager began it's sophmore season so there was a great deal of hoopla surrounding this season. In terms of the show the feeling was different. Unlike in the first season where the crew of Voyager were dealing with all their new challanges,this season found them truly facing the unknown from another ""cartaker"" trying to manipulate Kes in ""Cold Fire"" to Janeway meeting up with her hero Amelia Earheart in 'The 37's'. This also marks the first appearance of Q in this series,on this occasion moderating a fellow Q's wish to commit suicide in the excellent and topical 'Death Wish'. The doctor also found love and Chakotay discovered an ancient riddle of his people in 'Tattoo';many of the episodes in this season had a slightly surreal and mystical bent as everything of familiarity to the Voyager crew started to be questioned. Even in 'Alliances"" Janeway cites the Delta Quadrant as a region of space without many rules. This season also works out some kinks in the shows construction;the Kazon were a rather uninteresting and poorly written adversary and came off as little more then a poor man's Klingon. So a series of story arcs come into play during this season in which they made their exit;a trader on the Voyager crew betrays unformation to the equally tretchurous Seska until being foiled by Neelix. Then Seska lies to Chakotay about having his baby (it's actually the Kazon Cullah's) and,in the cliffhanger the Kazon story is concluded after a failed attempt by Seska to commandere the ship. Over time this is probably the Voyager season I've seen the most because of all the type surrounding the anniversary year,also because I think many Star Trek fans were looking for any signs of sophmore slump. Well there really wasn't;just some weaker moments where the kinks of the series were being ironed out.

2023236,3,B0001NBNFW,"STAR TREK: VOYAGER was a show that from the beginning was marked by substantial potential, almost none of it that was fulfilled.  From the outset it had two major things going for it, several interesting characters and a great premise.  But it failed to develop to any great extent any of the characters and neglected the narrative format demanded by the premise.

To see what I mean by the failure to develop characters, contrast VOYAGER with a show it overlapped for several years, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  In a way this is unfair since BUFFY was one of a handful of television series that completely changed the rules of how TV was done.  BUFFY altered the way characters were handled on a TV show, but VOYAGER had its format established well before the debut of BUFFY.  Still, retroactively the one show makes watching the earlier one more difficult to watch because of how it expanded what a television series was allowed to do with character.  Here is an experiment:  take any character on BUFFY and see where they started out on the series and where they ended up.  One is immediately struck by the enormous journey each undertook.  Willow, Anya, Spike, Cordy, Buffy herself all go through so many changes and crises that by the end of the series they are completely different people.  Now, contrast this with VOYAGER.  Just about every character on the show is very close to the same character at the end of the series as at the beginning.  There might be some alterations in romantic attachments and there might be some added depth, but all the characters pretty much remain the same throughout.  This is even true of characters you would have expected to have nothing except potential to grow, like the Doctor and later Seven of Nine.

I've argued a lot with myself about precisely why VOYAGER -- and indeed, most of the STAR TREK series -- are so timid with regard to character development.  I have no completely satisfying answer.  Certainly I think the show's writers were determined to focus more on story than character, with the latter ancillary to whatever tale is being told.  The trend in TV since the mid-nineties has been to character over story (Damon Lindelhof of LOST has explicitly stated that while they want to have a good story, they have taken BUFFY as their template as the way to develop narrative by primarily focusing on character).  On VOYAGER, though lots of things happen to the characters, nothing much in fact ever happens to the characters.

The second great failure on the show was the overall failure to focus on an overarching narrative.  The premise of the show would seem to demand this, but instead the show persistently -- especially in Season Two -- stresses episodic storytelling at the expense of serial elements.  Again, this is partly the fault of timing.  TV historians usually cite TWIN PEAKS as the first show with a long overarching narrative, followed somewhat more successfully by THE X-FILES, before BUFFY perfected the format.  (The usual way of telling the story is this:  TWIN PEAKS introduced the idea of a long narrative, but proceeded to collapse under its own storytelling.  THE X-FILES told a long and often compelling story in its alien colonization story, but failed to integrate this sufficiently with character development and failed to make the narrative terribly consistent over the years [e.g., all the different explanations about what happened to Mulder's sister and the evolving explanation as to who Mulder's father was].  BUFFY managed both to tell compelling season-long stories while engaging in breathtaking character development.)

The episodic nature of the show wouldn't have been so bad if the writing hadn't so often failed.  There are many episodes in Season Two that are torturous to watch.  A prime example is ""Non Sequitur,"" in which Harry Kim wakes up in San Francisco in what he gradually realizes is an alternative reality.  The plot is so hackneyed and tedious to watch that visiting the dentist office would be preferable.  Unfortunately there are many such episodes.

Adding to the problems are some of the ongoing elements that do make their way onto the show.  I'm not a fan of aliens on SF shows (the only SF series that I can truly say that I love that had aliens was FARSCAPE -- on all others aliens were at best an irritant), but STAR TREK has a genius for bad aliens.  The Kazon were a constant presence on the show in the first half of its run (though they thankfully disappeared after Voyager made its way past Borg space).  Their main characteristics were their extreme militarism combined with plaster-of-paris hair.  The most I can say for them is that they weren't as awful as the Ferengi.

Still, amidst all this were some good elements.  I find a couple of the characters irritating -- Jennifer Lien is lovely to look at (except for those horrid ears), but she was just way too timid and mild-mannered for my taste, while Neelix has to join any short list of the most irritating characters in the history of TV -- but most of the main characters I really liked.  I felt that way, way too little was done in the first few seasons with B'Elanna Torres.  The idea of a half human and half Klingon individual had wonderful possibilities, but for some reason the show at most merely gestures at them.  Roxann Dawson was really good in the role, but as mentioned above, the show remained primarily a series that focused on plot rather than character.  Too bad.  I also enjoyed Tim Russ as Tuvok.  Although I hate aliens, I must confess to enjoying Vulcans.  Though many criticized Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, I loved her and though she gave the show some backbone through her presence.  I always though that Harry Kim was the show's weakest link, but I absolutely loved the Doctor.  One of the things that cyborgs, robots, and other kinds of artificial people do is make us ask questions about what it means to be human.  No character I know of in the history of TV does this quite to the extent that Voyager's Emergency Holographic Doctor does.  Even so, I felt that the show didn't do as much with the kinds of questions his presence raise as it could have.

In short, VOYAGER is a show that persistently was less than the sum of its parts.  Mainly this is because the show's producers and writers failed to provide a compelling overarching framework and narrative to develop characters.  But at least it got some things right.",1201392000,,6433,4.753832281334535
2023237,3,B0001NBNFW,"This is the 2nd season of Star Trek Voyager.  This is a season like the first of uneven quality.

What I liked:  There were interesting episodes those being ""Lifesigns""(a doctor's prescribed treatment vs. a patients wishes), ""The Thaw""(the Cirque du Soleil episode with a fine performance by Michael McKean), ""Investigations""(finding sedition within the Voyager crew).  The series was not much for developing story arcs.  The writers didn't pretend to do so. There were interesting species such as the Vidians.  They were not a ""disposable hostile"" type of people.  They had a devastating disease but ahd a monstrous way to deal with it.  They only had a few stories in this season.

What I didn't like:  The episodes ""37s""(The crew has an opportunity to settle on an earth like planet).  There was the lack of character development as well.  The bad guys of the series, the Kazon, are little more than dime store Klingons with none of the redeeming qualities of the latter.  Seska, the crewmember who leaves Voyager, is shown as a traitor.  Why?  Season 2 doesn't cover this; a thumbnail recap would have helped.  That she's a Cardassian spy?  Not enough.  It would have been far more interesting to have her as a Sharon the Cylon type/someone who comes back as a crewmember but is never completely trusted.

Many fault the Star Trek franchise for being too idealistic and not ""dark and edgy""(those ""dark and edgy"" series IMHO will probably be doomed to be dated as Lava Lamps, Disco, and Leg warmers).  This is not a problem for this reviewer.  However, a little more character development would help.  Of course, I'm only referreing to Season 2.",1201132800,,1648,4.873646209386282

Profit on the series has already been made when it aired in the 90's.  Selling the DVD's is gravy on the already profitable Star Trek franchise.  I'm still dumbfounded why the big media corporations can't figure out why pirating videos is such a problem.  Put the product in the hands of the customers at a price they are willing to pay.

See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a market fair price of $25-35.  So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range.  So, $60 is your sweet spot.

You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop.

2023244,4,B0001NBNFW,"The second season of Star Trek Voyager exhibits the best and worst of what Star Trek can be.  Some of the best episodes of any Star Trek series ever are part of the second season.  These include episodes like ""Meld"", ""Death Wish"", and ""Lifesigns"".  However, the worst episode ever produced on Star Trek Voyager, ""Threshold"", is part of the second season.

  The season can really be divided into two halves.  The first half of the season is extremely weak with only a few brite spots.  ""The 37's"" is a fun beginning to the season where we meet Amelia Earheart and ""Projections"" introduces Lt. Barclay to Voyager.  These are really the two redeeming moments of the first half of the season.  The season then digresses to the Doctor massaging Kes' feet so she can conceive a child.  The episode ""Twisted"" shows our valiant crew giving up and everything still working out.  The weakest point, however, is when Paris and Janeway are flopping around in the muck with their alien offspring.  A lot of this is laughable.

  The season, however, more than redeems itself in the second half where it produces one masterpiece after the next.  ""Meld"" is the best Tuvok episode ever, dealing with the mind of a Ensign Sudor, who has murdered a fellow crewman.  ""Death Wish"" is quite possbily the best Q episode in any series.  ""Death Wish"" deals with immortality, assisted suicide, cruel and unusual incarceration, the meaning of existence, and we finally get to visit the Q Continuum.  ""Lifesigns"" is probably the best Doctor episode ever and that is saying a lot.  ""Lifesigns"" deals with a hologram falling in love and the meaning of true love.  It also explores the issues surrounding an individual living with the consequences of the Vidian Phage virus day in and day out.  ""The Thaw"" is awesome!  It is unbelievable how an emotion, fear, could be brought to life in a constructed reality with such vivid power.  ""Tuvix"" once again deals with powerful issues, such as the right to exist.  Is it right to destroy one sentient being to create another?  What if that being was created by accident and you are destroying that being to restore two others?  That is the premise for ""Tuvix"".  B'Lanna has some great moments when she confronts the consequences of her past in ""Dreadnaught"".  She struggles with the fact that she may be responsible for the destruction of an innocent civilization.  In ""Prototype"" B'Lanna experiences the joy of basicly giving birth to a lifeform, a prototype unit.  Finally, the season ends with a great cliffhangar, ""Basics"".  In ""Basics"" the Kazon, Seska, and Chakotay's baby storylines all come to a head and in the process the Voyager crew is marooned on a volcanic planet with no technology.  WOW!

  Buy this set!  Don't get discouraged by the season's slow start.  The season explodes in the end with a level of storytelling hardly ever matched by any other Star Trek season.",1127433600,5,2899,4.815040650406504
2023245,4,B0001NBNFW,"Still developing the characters in the 2nd Season, Star Trek Voyager continued to consistently pump out great stories, combined with the usual sets, costumes, special effects and music that you've come to expect from Star Trek.

Slightly better than the first season, viewers are treated to a full season ( 26 episodes )of terrific stories.

By now the main elements of the characters are familiar, as each major character gets at least one story about them this season.

Continuing it's journey home from the Delta Quadrant, Captain Janeway and her crew encounter all sorts of aliens through this season.

Although many fans didn't like the ""kazon"", I did not mind them too much. Sure they were a little like the Klingons, but I didn't think they were too overused.

Early on this season, we see more use of Robert Picardos wonderful Doctor character in an episode called "" Projections"" which is also a chance to see "" Lt. Barclay"" who Next Gen fans fans will remember from that series.

Ensign Kim gets his first major episode in ""Non Sequitur "", with a nice look at the modern Earth and Starfleet headquarters to boot.

First Officer ""Chakotay"" gets an episode too; "" Tattoo"" which reveals, guess what, yes, just how he gets that Tattoo.

The best twist, and one of the best twists for Star Trek ever, was the defection of "" Seska"" who turns out to be a sneaky Cardassian instead, and joins the Kazon.

"" Prototype"" was a another first with superb camera angles in the intro as Engineer Torres reactivates some AI in the form of a shiny silver robot.

Some other interesting episodes were Tom Paris breaking through the warp barrier in "" Threshold"", Tuvoks murder investigation in "" Meld "" and a Cardassian weapon gone wrong in "" Dreadnought""

There's plenty here for those who enjoyed the first season.

And the stories just get sharper from here on.

As usual, this comes with a bunch of extras, interviews etc, which makes you appreciate the show even more.

Well done Star Trek! A great series.

2023246,4,B0001NBNFW,"Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...

Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...

The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The 37's"" in which the Voyager discovers a 1936 Ford truck floating through random space. The vehicle soon leads them to the discovery of several cryogenic chambers that contain humans abducted by aliens during the 1930s, among them - Amelia Earhart and her navigator... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Tatoo"" in which Commander Chakotay attempts to establish contact with the beings his ancestors named the ""Sky Spirits"" after discovering a religious symbol from his home planet, and ""Deathwish"" in which Q seeks asylum aboard the Voyager while threatening suicide...

The acting equally so, and this season is filled with great ideas.  We see the return of the great Star Trek ""villain"" Q, and Voyager's head-butts with the Kazon continue.  There is even a shot at peace.  A possible relationship between Chakotay and Janeway emerges, and some typical Star Trek temporal mechanics confusion!  We actually see a starship land!  The return of the Voyager supervillain Seska!  Who could ask for more?  Not to mention that the mystery of a Amelia Earhart is finally solved...in a Trekkie sort of way.

2023251,5,B0001NBNFW,Star Trek Voyager is unique. It was designed with the idea that there would be a finite beginning and end of the story both being major events. I have watched every episode of every season. I have enjoyed the character developement and maturing of the stars. They grew as the story went on. What made it so interesting is that very few of these stories that involve some journey ever reach the ending. This 7 season story ended in grace. I enjoyed the journey every bit of the way. Thanks!,1098057600,4,489,4.444444444444445
2023252,3,B0001NBNFW,"As a preface to this review, I should say that I have been a huge fan of Star Trek Voyager since the original broadcasts of the very first season. When I was away from a television set for a year, I even had a friend videotape all the episodes I missed so that I could see them when I returned to civilization.

 But I have to admit that season two is my least favorite of Voyager. There are certainly some great episodes, but many left me frustrated and disappointed.

 The height of the season, and the first real standout episode in the series, is Death Wish, with the amusing John De Lancie reprising his role from TNG, along with Jonathan Frakes as Riker. The plot, about right-to-death issues, adds a very serious foundation to all the fun. And Kate Mulgrew finally breaks out of her shell here and shows what she's made of as an actress.

 The 37's is another solid episode, connecting Janeway to her childhood hero Amelia Earhart; Resistance gives Mulgrew a chance to act with the excellent and Oscar-winning Joel Grey. Meld affords another great guest star, LOTR's Brad Dourif, the opportunity to brighten up--or really darken--the season. This episode also provides fascinating insights into the emotional turmoil beneath the surface of Lt. Tuvok. Lifesigns lets Robert Picardo's character The Doctor take a very significant step toward becoming human, by falling in love. The Thaw, with another refreshing guest star (the guy who played Lenny in Laverne and Shirley), is the first of what I like to call Voyager's bizarro episodes. These are absurd and really wonderful, in the spirit of the original series. Deadlock I love, and it gives Janeway an excellent chance to get to know herself better, and the season ends with the strong cliffhanger Basics Part 1.

 Somewhat weaker, but still good, installments include Initiations, Projections, Elogium, and Non Sequitor, all of which could have been much more engaging. Persistence of Vision seems great until the alien's last line, which makes me wonder why I sat through the last forty-five minutes. The Kazon arc stories Maneuvers, Alliances, and Investigations also should have provided more compelling viewing. Certainly Martha Hackett is more than adequately treacherous and villainous as Seska, but the Kazons just don't seem very interesting. A missed opportunity: the show could have allied Seska with the Vidiians. Just imagine the creepy romantic scenes between her and some gross Vidiian captain. And how would she have kept that race from harvesting her body parts? We'll never know. Resolutions, the season's penultimate epidsode, deals with a plot thread I never really warmed up to: the almost romance between Janeway and Chakotay. I just see him with someone else, and her with someone else.

 Weaker episodes are, unfortunately, many: Twisted, Parturition, Tattoo, Cold Fire, for example, all of which had interesting premises but poor executions. Roxann Dawson, who plays Torres as both fiery and brainy, gets substandard material to work with in both Prototype and Dreadnought, which basically have the same plot, if you think about it (robot, or computer, gone out of control). The entire series' bottom of the barrel is Threshold, which even its writer Brannon Braga candidly admits in one of the easter egg clips. Poor Robert Duncan McNeill, who tries to give this turkey some real emotion! Many people love Tuvix, I know, but perhaps I don't because I'm still mad at Janeway for destroying a new life form in order to get two valued crew members back. I understand her decision, but it still feels like murder somehow.

 The additional material on this set is particularly entertaining, with interviews with Martha Hackett, Ethan Phillips, and Tim Russ, who even sings, quite well, in another hidden extra--though it's not that difficult to find. In Braving the Unknown Michael Piller is very honest about creative difficulties during the season, and perhaps this tug-of-war explains the uneven quality of this year of Voyager. The visual effects bit taught me the lesson that even a lackluster episode such as Threshold involved the incredible talents and work of many people, in this case to produce the CG alien babies of Janeway and Paris.

 And if that last little plot point isn't enough to convince you that this season is Voyager's least strong, then I'll just give up. Still, the characters and actors grew and developed, the episodes hosted some amazing guests, and much was set up that would be developed in later seasons.

 Those who are not Voyager fans should not start with this season, but perhaps with the superior third. Once you've seen enough excellent stuff, come back to this set to complete your knowledge of the fascinating Delta Quadrant world of the good ship Voyager.",1090627200,13,4778,5.013888888888889
2023253,5,B0001NBNFW,"Although I enjoyed season 1 of Voyager, I felt some of its episodes could have been better--especially the anti-climatic season finale that consisted of Tuvok having to train unruly Maquis cadets. Season 2 does not have this problem. From start to finish, it was a season that left me wanting to watch just one more episode before going to bed and then rewatching them. Every main character is given a chance to shine from Tuvok going berserk in Meld to Torres dealing with a delusional mega-bomb to Chakotay dealing with Seska and the Kazon (with a great return of Aron ""Nog"" Eisenberg as a young Kazon ready to earn his name by attempting to kill Chakotay in Initiations) in a couple of episodes. I also enjoyed the multi-episode plot arc with Paris becoming more and more of a jerk that meshes with the rogue Starfleeter who was busy betraying his comrades to the Kazon and the pregnant crewmember and her improbable baby. There were plenty of my favorite type of episodes, the ""what is real/what is actually going on here"" concept. Watching the Doctor announce, to the Viidean he was hot for, in the middle of surgery--like he was asking her to pass the scalpel--that he was attracted to her made me cringe with delight and it made me glad that this series continued the fish out of water/emotionally clueless character that each series has employed (Spock, Data, Odo, and the EMH Doctor). Finally, the season finale, Basics Part 1 was a romping kick in the stomach that has me desperately awaiting for the release of season 3 so I can see how the crew regains their lost ship from, as my friend calls them, the garbage head Kazons. All in all, this was one of the best seasons of any of the Star Trek series.",1085011200,6,1713,4.601307189542483
2023254,4,B0001NBNFW,"What I used to find typical of every Star Trek Series since TNG was that the first two seasons seem to be very klunky and disjointed.  It isn't until the third season that everything seems to come together:  the writing, the plot lines, the acting even gets better as the actors get more familiar and more comfortable with their roles.
Star Trek-Voyager in this regard has quite a few memorable moments that need to be highlighted here.  It was pretty much the ugly stepchild of DS9, which at this time had far better resources devoted to it than Voyager did.
However, those few memorable moments really stuck out whereas in DS9, it was focused on the central plot of the Emissary and his relation to Bajor and the growing threat of the Dominion looming over the Alpha Quadrant.  Voyager's memorable 2nd season episodes include some of my favorite episodes of all time:  ""Death Wish"".  This is the story of an exiled Q Continuum member who wants to die and was banished for wanting that.  Voyager encounters this being and then encounters the other that we are more familiar with and they take Janeway on a tour through the Continuum, which seems to resemble everything and yet nothing at the same time.  No other series ever went to great lengths to explain or depict the Continuum the way Voyager did.  We would revisit this again in the Third season as it is depicted as a US Civil War Battle.
""The Thaw"" is also another episode of note.  Voyager answers a distress call from a planet that suffered an environmental catastrophe and the survivors went underground and slept through this in suspended animation, only to be held hostage by their manifestation and personification of their fears, which was brilliantly played by Michael McKean, of ""Laverne & Shirley"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" fame.  His depiction of fear personified was so over the top that you focus on him and on what he is going to do next rather than on Janeway and her crew, who are desparately running out of time.
""Tuvix"" is another episode that stands out when two characters who barely got along with each other as it was get merged together with a plant through a transporter accident and become a fourth entity that wants to fight for its existence at the expense of the other three.  This issue puts the crew and Janeway into an ethical dilemma:  do we accept this new entity or do we get Tuvok and Neelix back.
The ongoing plot lines with the Kazon, the Treib and the Vidiians also show up here.  But these seem to sputter out and exhaust themselves by the end of the second season, when we find Janeway and her crew in a worse situation than being stuck out in the Delta Quadrant--that's when they are thrown off their own ship, left with only the clothes on their backs and stranded on a planet.
I watched this series from beginning to end and saw it improve with age.  Like TNG before it, the second season episodes depict a show finding itself and by the end of it, we find the show always going back to its main premise, an Alpha Quadrant ship stranded in some far-flung corner of the galaxy with its crew sometimes fighting each other and the many enemies they made while trying to get home.",1083974400,5,3178,4.570422535211268

8015586,4,B0001NBNFW,"Fun to watch despite inconsistencies. Alright, Star Trek has already had inconsistencies, but a few of these really disturbed me. For instance, exactly how old was Kes when she joined Voyager? Kes turns two during this season, but last season she spoke about losing her father when she was just one (I don't remember the exact words). It seems to me that the writers did not have a clear understanding of Kes' timeline. Another thing that bothered me was the captain's hair. While this has nothing to do with the content of the show, how is it that her hair was shorter in episode 7 then apparently grew in time for the next episode? The shows themselves were fun to watch, and the characters had interesting developments and growth, but these and other inconsistencies left me puzzled.",1524960000,,786,4.744525547445256

8015592,3,B0001NBNFW,"A surprisingly good second season, that in a lot of ways feels closer to TNG, in a good way. Rich character development and intriguing stories. Of course it isn't always completely plausible (such as, if they are leaving Kazon space to get home, how do they keep winding up running into the same aliens? Is everyone following them?)  The Kazon are also a ridiculous enemy and difficult to take seriously, as they seem like third-rate Klingons combined with Troll-doll hair. Thankfully there isn't too much of the Phage this season as a little of that body horror goes a long way.
A satisfying conclusion to the season, even if the cliffhanger was a bit corny (as you see Janeway in that final thought, I could hear her thinking, ""They're taking my ship.  I'm not going to cry... not going to cry..."")",1514937600,,800,4.666666666666667
