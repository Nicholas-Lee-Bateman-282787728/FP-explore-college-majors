1685081,4,B000062XEE,"Upper Body Parts is a compilation of late 80s/early 90s Firm videos, so there are various segments taught by different instructors. The overall effect is a bit choppy, but there is a separate instructor to cue the transitions, which helps a little. On the plus side, the different instructors means less chance of boredom--ie, it's more interesting to do several sets of the same exercise when each exercise is with a different instructor. Another advantage is that you get a wide variety of upper body work packed into a time-saving workout.

The Firm's philosophy is to combine aerobic activity with strength training. Although this tape is more focused on the toning aspect, frequently you are moving your lower body while working out your upper body--eg, toe touches while doing military presses--which can sometimes be a bit awkward.  The exercises themselves are all very traditional--flies, military presses, bicep curls, tricep extensions, etc.--although they are often done in unique combinations and timings. Several sets of dumbells are recommended, and a few segments used either a tall or short ""box"", but you can substitute a bench, chair, or step. Unlike most other upper upper body workouts, the biceps receive little attention here.  Overall, this is a solid, thorough workout for the uppder body, although it now has a bit of a dated feel.",1155081600,3,1357,5.159090909090909
1685082,4,B000062XEE,"Some people complain that ""The Firm"" instructors are cheesy ect., but most all workout videos have some annoying factor to them like that.  I have had this video for about a year and a half.  I got it in a four pack with the 5 Day Abs and Tough Tape 2.  I find that sometimes, if my arms are tired, or have been injured in some way, I can use the Standing Legs DVD to give them a break.  The same in reverse, if my legs are sore, I can use the Upper Body DVD.  I think that the leg presses are tough and sometimes, its hard for me to complete this whole workout.  If I feel too tired to keep working on mostly my legs, I switch to the upper body for a few minutes, then switch back.  When I use this video, I only use it if I feel strong and ready for something tough!  I'm always trying to remember to breathe out when I lift up the weights, and that helps make it work better and be more aerobic.  I would say, if you don't maind that the people can be irritating, get this DVD.  When you get used to doing the moves, you don't even have to look at the people.",1136851200,6,1062,3.8976744186046512
1685083,2,B000062XEE,"I'm glad this tape (The Firm Standing Legs) only cost me $1.49 at the thrift store, and I think I know why it ended up there.

For entertainment purposes alone, it's worth finding on sale for the soft-porn appeal of the suggestive 80's music, along with the moans and sighs reaching a climax during the final sets.

I'm sorry, but the candy-colored tights and thongs, along with all the 80s hairdos and Barbie Dolls were just too distracting.

Yes, the women are beautiful, and we all like to look at beautiful people, but their ""Aren't I beautiful?"" facial expressions started to get to me, and I just kept laughing all the way through the workout.  I think a step would be more appropriate as the fanny lifter is just too high, especially for shorter people. I think you could get seriously injured with it if you have joint problems. The way they instructed, I also felt like I was being ordered about by a bunch of Nazi fembots, constantly exchanging dumbbell weights (pyramiding) and putting on and removing the ankle weights at least three times. There were also WAY too many people adding to the distraction in this workout, who didn't look too happy about the endless sets and reps, either.  The workout is 45 minutes long, but seemed to go on forever, and I was bored with all the sets.  It needs to be updated because studies have shown that all those sets don't give much more results after a certain point.  After trying it, I have no doubt it works; many of these programs work if you use them diligently, but some of them are not for everyone. Since I have a short attention span, I keep going back to Tamilee Webb (Tighter Assets), who at least offers more variety and has you trying different moves. Before you know it, you're done with the workout. She's also a lot more personable, inspirational and human, and women in their 30s and 40s will be able to identify with her better than with these impossibly perfect Bond Girls.",1126828800,4,1943,4.566091954022989
1685084,5,B000062XEE,"i began using standing legs 7 months after my second child was born.  i had lost all my baby weight after baby #1 without working out, but it wasn't the same after #2.  i used it 2 days a week- t & th, and used another firm dvd m,w,f, and after 7 months of faithfully using it, there was a considerable difference.  sure, the outfits were cheesey.  sure the music is not the greatest.  but i didn't get this to be entertained.  that's what movies are for.  i had to really concentrate on the moves and for the first month on not passing out.  but let me tell you- it really worked.  now after baby #3, i am excited to know that standing legs is on dvd.  my first was on tape and with no vcr, i've had to make due with other dvds that just didn't cut it.  i will be sure to add this to my collection but, unlike the others, i will be using this.",1117670400,15,844,3.9642857142857144
1685085,3,B000062XEE,"This DVD is a combination of The Firm's Upper Body and Standing Legs workouts. There is also a bonus feature included, The Firm's Bonus Fitness Training Program. This bonus program explains the physiology behind using weights, and discusses the importance of good form in performing sculpting exercises.
The Upper Body workout is a spliced combination of older firm workouts. From the leg warmers, Greek-inspired statues, and hairstyles you will note the age of this workout - the entire look and feel is 80's inspired. The music, as well, includes saxophone and synthezied pieces that are reminiscent of the decade of big hair.
The Upper Body workout itself runs for 35 minutes. There is a total of 11 minutes of warming up and stretching, 21 minutes of upper body weight work, and 3 minutes of stretching to finish. The exercises included are multiple sets of push-ups, pectoral fly, upright rows, and more. You will need dumbbells (3 - 15 pounds) for this workout. There is no ab work included.
The Standing Legs workout is also pieces out together of older, 80's style workouts. The workout runs for 42 minutes and includes: 8 minutes of warming up and stretching, 30 minutes of heavy lower body work, and 5 minutes of stretching at the end. There is no ab work.
The Lower Body segment uses dumbbells, The Firm's Fanny Lifter, and optional ankle weights. The exercises will be familiar to people who have done Firm workouts before: lots and lots of Leg Press step-ups onto the Fanny Lifter, lunges, knee lifts, and more. This is a difficult workout, sure to challenge any level.
The DVD has a Scene Selection feature, so you can skip over any segments that you do not want to use. However, if you select ""Play Workout"" from the Main Menu, you are subjected to a Firm commercial each workout you use. So, if you run the entire DVD, you have to watch this commercial twice.
While I did not find the Upper Body workout terrifically challenging, I thought that the Standing Legs workout was tough and efficient. Be sure to complement these strength-training workouts with a cardio program and a good stretch to avoid injury. If you have knee problems, you may want to skip this DVD. At a height of 14"", the Fanny Lifter will aggravate knee injuries, especially doing multiple sets of Leg Press.",1048032000,46,2294,4.7808564231738035
1685086,3,B000062XEE,"Booooooooooooooooooooooring!!!!!  The Firm workouts are effective, sure.  If you do these workouts, you'll get toned.  So if you just want results, go ahead and buy them.  But you may die of boredom before you get fit!!  I have other Firm workouts which aren't compilations of old stuff, and they're WAY better.  At least they have variety and don't jump around all over the place.
Both of these workouts are just bits and pieces of old Firm tapes which have been pasted together.  And because the Firm workouts are all based on the same moves, you'll be doing the same moves over and over and over and over and over again!!  The Standing Legs workout is just endless lunges.  There came a point after I'd been lunging for what seemed like hours, and then they said ""prep for lunges"" and I just screamed and turned the DVD off!!!  And the Upper Body workout has you doing lat rows ad nauseum.
If you want a good workout, I highly recommend the Firm.  Just not this particular DVD.  Make sure that whatever workout you choose is a complete, new workout, and not a bad compilation of old stuff.",1047772800,12,1092,4.543589743589743

1685117,2,B000062XEE,"My wife loves this series. Kudos to anyone who can keep up, it seems really hard. However, the copy we got was just awful. The root menu is stills are clear, but the actual program looks like my 80's VHS copy of Terminator: high-waisted outfits and bad hair seen in a grainy, washed-out blur. When I want to see women in blue eyeshadow and frosted bangs grunt and sweat in high V-cut bikinis, I want to be able to SEE that feathered hair ripple as the pelvis bumps to synthesized neo-disco. I can only imagine that at the time of transfer to digital, the only copy that could be found of this long-lost epic video was discovered under the mattress of silicon valley tech-nerd's bedroom in the basement of his parent's house. Do I want to know the reason why the tape was watched 6,427 times by that sad little man before they transferred it to digital? No, I do not. But the history of our culture deserves more attention. Why can't they take the tape and do that million-dollar, frame-by-frame digital enhancement that they did for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? They did a great job on the digital transfer there, and that movie wasn't even half as important to our national heritage as The Firm- Upper Body & Standing Legs. Though Mr. Stewart probably look less frightening in a V bikini.

1685125,5,B000062XEE,"I have had this DVD for a while now, but hadn't added it into my workout rotation until this week. I just did Standing Legs for the first time and WOW!  What a tough leg workout!  I can see how it can produce quick results if you do it often enough!  There are LOTS of leg presses, but it wasn't the leg presses that got my legs feeling like jelly.  It wasn't the lunges either.  It was the squats.  I got to the point where I almost felt like I was going to fall down if I squatted one more time. I'm sure it was a combination of all of the leg work that caused me to feel that way, but I'm choosing to blame it on the squats.  :-)  This definitely isn't a workout that I could do every day and I've been working out steadily for a year now and consider myself to be in decent shape.  As a matter of fact, I took a rest day after doing this workout to give my muscles time to repair.  Since I'm getting ready for a beach vacation soon, I will definitely fit this one in a few more times before my trip.  After I did the standing legs portion, I changed the DVD and did two of the workouts from the 5 Day Abs disc to get some ab work in.  If you want to get a serious leg workout, get this disc!!

I can now supplement my review as I've done the Upper Body workout for the first time.  I liked it, but did feel that it focused a lot on working the lats.  That's fine, but I'd prefer less lat work and more bicep, tricep, and shoulder work.  There is some of all of that in there too, though.  The sorest part of my upper body the day after doing this workout was my pecs.  I do like this upper body workout and will definitely do it again!",1368057600,2,1639,3.900302114803625

1685152,5,B000062XEE,"Ok, I started using these around 1995. Let me tell you; the Standing Legs is STILL (to this day) the HARDEST standing leg workout on video!! I don't care how many lower body workouts I have done (with light or heavy weights), this ""Parts"" video still stands for the ""Workout Hall of Fame"". Why? Well, when there is 3 or 4 sets of 14inch LEG PRESS, then you WILL feel the ""burn""!! (if you are short or under 5'4"" or have bad knees- even with doing these on a 8 inch or 12 inch step (rubbermaid steps work fine) and use heavier weights you WILL STILL FEEL THE BURN!! There is NO floor exercises, and NO abs, so if you need to add a floor leg rutine (floor workouts for your legs are actually good to banish cellulite by the way), then I recommend using ""Lower Body Sculpting"" by Kathy Derry (another ""parts"" video from the FIRM-if you can find it). Or a separate abs section from any good ab video you own as well.

Alone, STanding legs is a great fat burner. Do not be fooled by the fact that there is no cardio in this workout. The weight work will get your heart pumping for sure,but a good little 30 min cardio add on will work fine if you still feel you didn't workout enough (but trust me, you will). The ONLY small complaint (but not a huge one at all), is that I wish they had some hamstring workout (although in this you are working everything)..I guess I mean more ""deadlifts"", but with the lower body parts or floor workouts, you will get your hamstrings in top shape anyways. There is also not enough ""calve"" workouts, although the section from Vol 6 with Jane Poteet (in the yellow uniform) does a few calf raises. But other than that, a GREAT butt, hips & thighs solid workout.

Upper Body Workout- Not as challanging as the Standing Legs, BUT it is a good workout if you use heavier weights (the beauty of these videos is you can heavy up or go lighter on any days you want!). The only thing I strongly feel they don't do enough in the Upper Body-is BICEP work! If there was more bicep work, then it would be PERFECT (and maybe a bit more shoulder work too). Your back gets a lot of work and everything else. Overall a great workout too.

Please with any beginners, do Standing legs carefully and start out with using a 8 or 10 or 12 inch box FIRST (OR if you DO use the full 14inch step, then use NO weights or at the most 5lbs). I promiss these videos WILL deliver!",1347148800,3,2380,4.237885462555066
1685153,5,B000062XEE,"I had this workout on VHS many years back and got rid of it when we moved.  3 years and 2 babies later I was thrilled to see it on DVD and picked up a used copy here on Amazon.  Yesterday as I did this workout for the first time in years it all came back to me as to why I LOVED this workout so much.  It was tough and kicked my butt!  I had to to hit pause a few times as the pace was too fast during those last set of tall box dips and hover squats (but I made it through!!) You do have to get past the aged look of the set and the instructor's outfits and hair (hey even the latest 2012 DVD's will look silly in a decade). You will sweat and your legs will burn-- in a good way; and that's what you are after in a workout, right?  I know from prior experience with this workout you will see changes! I will do this one once a week in a rotation of various other DVD's from the Firm and others.  I also own the more recent ""Jiggle Free Buns"" and it is good but not as good as this one.  I would recomend you work up to using the tall box and stick with the short box to start with as this can cause knee pain if your knees are weak.

The upper body part of this DVD is fine but realy does nothing for the biceps.  There are better upper body workouts but this will do if you add on some bicep work.",1329782400,6,1300,3.7326007326007327

The weight is too light and the speed is too quick, compromising form, and reducing it's effectiveness. The upper body video, once again, has too many reps, with too little weight to warrant an effective upper body workout. At the end of each workout my heart rate remained low, my muscles were not pumped, and I had a hard time telling whether my muscles or my joints were fatigued from the excessive reps.

1685163,3,B000062XEE,"I will start off by saying that Upper Body has always been one of my favorite Firm workouts (and I have owned over fifty of them!) It is a good workout for those days when you cannot stand the thought of doing aerobics or tiring out your legs with lunges and squats. I also believe that it's an excellent starter workout for beginners, or those just getting back into fitness. I say this because it's harder to get out-of-breath doing primarily upper body work. If the floor-based work (like pec flyes) are instead done on a workout bench or high, long step, then one can avoid having to get down on the floor. So if a knee injury prevents you from doing that, don't be afraid of this workout! I have probably done UB 200 times in the last 19 years of owning it. I originally owned both of these workouts on VHS, and wore them out. These were filmed from 1985-1993, and it shows in terms of the fashion and hair. That said, they are effective workouts which stand the test of time. It would have been nice if The Firm had also put their 5-Day Abs workout on this one DVD, too. This will not be all that you need, but it's still a good addition to one's workout library.

If you use light weights, UB is a milder workout that still leaves you feeling like you completed something good. If you use heavy weights, you should definitely tire out your lats, triceps, delts and pecs. The biceps work is minimal, but then there's a fair amount of that in most FIRM workouts and so assuming you cross-train, you'll be fine. UB is about 35 minutes long. As an advanced exerciser now, I find a couple of limitations exist with UB. For one, the 35-minute length does fall significantly short of the hour I like to put into exercise a day. I almost never use UB by itself in one day. Another aspect that limits the workout some is the layout of exercises. There are plenty of ""pre-exhaust"" exercises, such as for the triceps, that can make it difficult to work your lats and pecs at maximum weight. Examples? Push-ups tend to follow lat rows, French presses, or other work that challenge the capacity to sustain push-up form perfectly. I recommend either resting between sets (assuming that you want to lift heavy; at this point in my workout life, that's what I do), or doing some light cardio and/or abdominal work in between. Also, the final stretch demonstrated in the tape isn't really appropriate to the strong upper body focus here, as it was not orignally designed for a solely-upper-body-workout, so I would recommend doing your own upper body stretches instead. Four sets of lat rows, several sets of push-ups, three hefty sets of pec flyes, lat pull-downs, double-arm and single-arm French presses, military presses, deltoid lifts for all three shoulder heads, some biceps curls, upright rows, and triceps extensions ensure the upper body gets a thorough workout! The more advanced may want to add in their own wrist work, rotator cuff exercises, and possibly some biceps sets.

Onward to Standing Legs! This workout was always known as a form of torture to the legs back in the Firm's heyday. If one goes shallow in their lunges, squats, and reverse lunges (The FIRM calls them dips), a beginner-intermediate could do this DVD. Rest between sets may be needed, and the pause button can come in handy here. It should thoroughly exhaust the quadriceps, if nothing else! There are no pli squats, deadlifts, or hamstring curls. I often add hip thrusts and a lower-body-and-abs workout like Tracie Long's Sculpted Buns, Hips and Thighs at the end of this. I do so to balance out the many, many lunges and squats in this workout, and exhaust all the leg muscles in my body thoroughly. I don't suggest this to beginners, but do keep in mind floor work for the legs is an essential add-on. Floor work trains the abductor, adductor, hamstring, and medial glute in a way standing exercises usually have a tough time hitting hard enough. Knee strength is dependent upon every muscle group being strong in the lower body, after all. The glutes ARE worked by the 14"" tall box leg press and also by lunges (to a lesser extent), but beginners should probably drop that step height down until they build their strength, flexibility, and endurance up. With a lower step height, shallow squat depth, and minimized lunge form, the quads are the primary muscle worked. Please balance this out with hamstring work, like the floor work done in Body Sculpting Basics by Susan Harris (also produced by The FIRM). Doing SL, UB, and Body Sculpting Basics once a week each, along with two to four days a week of cardio, will get you an AMAZING body! Trust me, I haven't worked out with The FIRM for twenty years because it doesn't work. ;) The other day my mother said, ""Wow, look at the muscle in the back of your upper arms! You're so toned."" Believe me, I was NOT born with shapely arms! :D

Some tips from this longtime FIRM Believer...With SL, I choose to focus on form, NOT on lifting hefty weights. Squat, lunge, and leg press form should be flawless and deep before attempting to add weights. Fitness is a marathon, not a sprint, so don't be in a rush to add dumbbells on before perfecting your form! I do my squats with thighs below parallel, something I worked towards over many months, and I get phenomenal results (especially in the quads!) for doing so. It will NOT harm the knees once proper form is perfected, and doing squats too shallow eliminates maximum results. Better to scale back the dumbbell weight, and develop full and perfected squat form first. I promise that when squats are done fully, everything else falls into place with lower body work. I also do my workouts barefoot - yet again, something I had to work towards - because it allows for the best squat depth, ankle stability and flexion, overall balance, proprioception, and max flexibility. SL is not such a long workout that you feel as if you're going to die, although you SHOULD reach exhaustion in the quadriceps and glutes. With bodyweight only or lighter weights, you can still get a GREAT workout, and have the chance to develop better form. Use heavy weights (10+ lbs. per side), and your lower body should be screaming. You can always modify the workout to make it harder, too! Do lunges on an incline step. Switch out back squats for Jefferson Squats. And so on. Don't be afraid to experiment! SL is about 45 minutes long. The stretch at the end is okay, but not really complete after such a tough workout, as it's only clocking in at 4 minutes in length. I always add in several extra minutes of stretching, because my legs and lower back need it every time.

When these came out, nothing else existed like it. Weight-training on tape was an anomaly back then (in 1993)! I have to be honest- once I saw Cathe Friedrich's Gym-Style Series (long after starting out with The FIRM), I was in awe! Her style of training is quite different than The FIRM's, and the lack of pre-exhaust exercises in Cathe's Gym-Style workouts enabled me to hit the lats and pecs harder and heavier than I had been able to with The FIRM UB. Cathe does amazing workouts for the advanced exerciser. She'll start out with three sets of push-ups, then progress to thoroughly working the chest, triceps, and abs (for example). I absolutely love that style of training now, but it'd be too much for most beginning exercisers. As much as I love The FIRM, almost invariably the more advanced exerciser will end up wanting a different style of workout down the road. That's simply the nature of progression with weight-training workouts. Nonetheless, you can absolutely get results from working out to this DVD, and they are an excellent primer to doing the more advanced and lengthy Cathe Friedrich workouts.",1234310400,11,7744,4.65036496350365
1685164,4,B000062XEE,"""Standing Legs"" is the best from The Firm collection, period.  (It really outpaces the hurried workouts the company seems to release every week now; I do not like any of the new material.)  I get a serious conditioning session as well as a little cardio each time I do this workout.  I owned it on VHS for years; I was glad when they transferred it to DVD to make it more accessible for my workouts.  I admit that the wardrobe is dated, but you get pass it when you are pumping the iron, doing the leg presses, and dripping with perspiration.  I'm not a huge fan of the ""Upper Body"" segment, which is why I gave this four instead of five stars.  I usually combine standing legs with a med ball or kettlebell workout to get a complete body workout.",1234137600,3,747,4.3
1685165,3,B000062XEE,"The cover is very deceptive.  This DVD is so dated, very Jane Fonda.  This was my first firm DVD.  I've not purchased any in the past because they typically require some type of special firm apparatus however I read so many great reviews I decided to give this a try since it mainly required weights according to the cover.

They've taken clips of upper body segments from various videos with different instructors and spliced them together with a different person introducing each segment.

There is an instructional section that I found somewhat informative, and it was a decent workout, but not something I would recommend spending money on unless you're partial to leotards and leg warmers.",1223078400,,694,4.948275862068965

7957908,5,B000062XEE,First off it took me a life time to find these. Back in the days this item was expensive now it's a give away. WARNING.

7957912,5,B000062XEE,"I first tried ""THE FIRM"" during the Mid-Nineteen Ninties. I began with ""THE FIRM CLASSIC WORKOUTS VOLUME 2"". It was tough, but I got very good results and faster too. I had been using one of JOYCE VEDRAL'S: ""THE FAT BURNING WORKOUT"", which was good but it was not, I felt, as Aerobic as her claim. But in a pinch, it worked. The thing was, I was not getting the results that I wanted. I was still, I felt,  a bit to chunky. I had seen ""THE FIRM"" advertised at the beginning of another Exercise Program. I remember thinking ""That is definitely not for me. It is way to strenuous"". But it was the combining of AEROBICS WITH WEIGHTS that intrigued me. So eventually I decided to try VOLUME 2 OF ""THE FIRM CLASSIC WORKOUTS"". I don't know why that peticular Volume. I think the first and third Volumes looked rather strenuous, so I decided to go with what I thought was the lesser evil. LOL. I got really good results. VOLUMES 2 AND 4 WERE MY FAVORITES.

But then, like so many exercise junkies, I kept switching around to this, that, and the next program, trying to find something I liked, that would get me the results I wanted. I've tried ""THE STEEL PROGRAMS"" WITH TAMILEE WEBB, JOYCE VEDRAL, LESLIE SANSONE, JANE FONDA, KATHY SMITH, JAZZERCISE, VARIOUS BELLYDANCING PROGRAMS, HULA, ZUUMBA, and on, and on, and on. All of the programs benefitted me in some way, except I just could not get into JAZZERCISE. I gave that program to a friend I had at the time.

After the Nineteen Nineties were over, I had almost gotten away from exercising. Eventually in 2002 I started walking during my LUNCH HOUR AT WORK. Then I came across ""THE FIRM BODY SCULPTING SYSTEM 2"", which included a 2-Part STEP BOX. I was excited. I was going to get back in shape and get on with things. I also bought ""THE FIRM WEIGHT STICK"". So after more issues, I once again had to fight my way back to exercising, beginning again with Walking and Dancing, working my way to weights again and other AEROBICS. I got myself into a bit of trouble during the RECENT HOLIDAYS with a bit if weight gain. The extra weight wasn't my only issue. I'M GETTING MARRIED. That led me immediately into a steadier exercise regiment.

I started AEROBICS again with WEIGHTS, switching with AEROBIC ONE DAY AND WEIGHTS THE NEXT. That was getting a bit strenuous. I had to devise a different idea. So back to ""THE FIRM"" I went. This DVD CONTAINS TWO PROGRAMS, which were originally sold on VHS, SEPARATELY. These two programs are made up of ""parts"" for the upper body and the lower body. The first program: ""UPPER BODY"", is 35 Minutes and requires 3-15 Pound Weights, plus a FANNY LIFTER. A STEP BOX WILL DO. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST USING THOSE LONG STEPS, UNLESS USING IT LIKE A ""BENCH"". The second program: ""STANDING LEGS"" is 42 Minutes and requires 3-15 Pound Weights, a FANNY LIFTER, a BARELL, ANKLE WEIGHTS, and a CHAIR. Though it says the BARBELL IS OPTIONAL, IT IS DIDFFICULT TO HOLD WEIGHTS UP BY YOUR SHOULDERS FOR TO LONG. I wouldn't suggest going higher than 35 Pounds, depending on how strong you are. Of course, with a BARBELL, WEIGHT PLATES CAN BE ADDED AND SUBTRACTED. ALSO IT SAYS ON THE PACKAGE THAT A CHAIR IS OPTIONAL. I THINK, AT LEAST KEEPING A CHAIR NEARBY IS A GOOD IDEA, EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE IT. As of Yesterday, I've use this program exactly FOUR TIMES, TWICE EACH PROGRAM. My body remembered the exercises. I had no problem except for space. LOL! I bought this program on March 06, 2016. I received it on March 10, 2016. I viewed it first. Then I used it the next day. I like this DOUBLE PARTS DVD PROGRAM. I INTEND TO BUY MORE OF ""THE FIRM CLASSIC PROGRAMS. I may buy ""TIME CRUNCH"", WHICH IS VOLUME 4, next. Right now I have enough EXERCISE PROGRAMS TO SWITCH, COMBINE WITH OR ROTATE OUT. MY WEDDING IS IN EXACTLY 288 DAYS. I AM DETERMINED TO BE IN THE BEST SHAPE I CAN BE IN. I RECOMMEND ""THE FIRM PROGRAMS"" IF YOU WANT TO ""SHORTCUT"" YOUR WAY INTO SHAPE. I'M NOT SUGGESTING NOT USING ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS, LIKE ""TONING EXERCISES"". I use an additional ABS TONING PROGRAM and additional AEROBICS with one part or the other, depending on how much time I have or energy. The only thing I dislike are the prices for ""THE CLASSICS"". They are a little steep. I don't remember what I paid for them on VHS. I have long given those away. I was so happy when I learned they had been placed on DVD. I believe ""THE FIRM CLASSICS"" ARE SUPERIOR TO OTHER WORKOUT PROGRAMS, BUT ONE HAS TO JUDGE THIS FOR THEMSELF. FOR QUICKER RESULTS BUY ""THE FIRM CLASSICS"".
