2318452,5,B0009T2JJW,"Unfortunately, there was no Nuremberg trial for the Russians. Controlling information was the Communist regime's specialty, so relatively few are aware of the planned starvation of the Ukranians in 1932-1933.

2318454,5,B0009T2JJW,"This excellent documentary is about the Holodomor (Ukrainian:  literal translation ""Death by Hunger""), a man-made famine in the Ukraine where 7 million farmers and peasants died cruel deaths. (1932-1933)
[...]

The unlawful machinations implemented by Stalin:
1) locked borders
2) controlled media
3) slavery thru taxation and intimidation
4) control of the food supply (law passed saying all food was state property)
5) mere possession of food was evidence of a crime
6) youth organization were recruited to enforce the draconian legislation
7) the education system was utilized for systemic brainwashing
8) thousands of watchtowers were constructed and staffed for surveillance
9) Youth brigades, stole food, humiliated peasants and raped women

It does not take any more than 5th grade brain power to see similar laws, dogma and unlawfulness being implemented today in order to advance the NWO agenda of population reduction, slavery and control.

1) The KILL GRID which is almost finished allows surveillance over virtually every intersection.  The huge concrete walls that line our roads for ""noise control"" are there to keep you from escaping lockdown under martial law. (we are already under martial law RULE)

2) All major media outlets are now under Orwellian control.  Corporate controlled media will never print a story about any major unlawful transgression of the local municipal corporation (e.g. City of Fort Lauderdale) or the illegality of a huge private corporation like the FEDERAL RESERVE.

3) I don't need to tell you about all the unlawful taxes and intimidation (arrest and incarceration for filming a public servant breaking the law)

4) It seems Monsanto and Cargill run the departments of the USA government that ostensibly protect us from ""bad food"" and bad companies.

5) Food Bill S510 ... need I say more ?

6) the Obama Youth Brigades
[...]

7) the only thing I learned in school that was not part of the MATRIX was
a) how to read
b) how to write
c) how to type

8) take a look at the cameras at virtually every intersection and all the insane microwave towers (mind control)

Please watch this movie and judge for yourself.
I got it for free thru the Inter Library Loan system.

2318455,5,B0009T2JJW,"This video is so indescribable that it is almost impossible to put words to this
absolutely disgraceful disgusting and completely incomprehensible degrading behaviour
of the perpetrators ,the soviet thugs, the Red Army, from Russia.
It is was  with tearful horror that one watched the unfolding of this tragedy, in this video .
Free Gulags being brutalised by Godless thugs whose only desire was greed and the
death of the victims by slow painful starvation .
How could any man starve another to death to steal his property.
The only reason they seem to have prospered at this ,is, that they were state sponsered.
This raises the issue of why have these perpetrators never been prosecuted for War crimes.
Freedom always seems to come at a price and the price for the Gulag was His life.
Any freedom loving person needs to see this video so the complete hypocrisy of the
soviet ideal, is exposed, for all to see and for those who are thinking of meddling,
take up a more worth while direction in your life.",1286668800,11,1005,4.7102272727272725

Among those interviewed are: Harvard University Author, Historian, and Professor, James E. Mace, Ph. D.; Toledo University, Robert S. Sullivant; British Correspondent, Malcolm Muggeridge; Former German Attach in Moscow, Johann Von Herwarth; former Village Midwife, Motria Dutka; Student during Famine years, Lubov Drashevska; former Professor of Journalism in Soviet Ukraine, Ivan Majstrenko; former Soviet General Petro Grigorenko; Survivor from Poltava, Reverend Alexander Bykovetz; and, many others.

This documentary is a rich reservoir of archival film, rare photographic evidence, and interviews (in English) with survivors and scholars (including foreign press). History is recorded on this DVD and presented in an engrossing, extremely informative presentation--it documents how the Soviet Government resorted to starving the populace by the millions, while simultaneously presenting a deliberately deceptive depiction to the world.

In his works, Dr. Mace, Harvard University Professor and Director of the US Commission into the study of the Ukrainian Famine, argued that during the early 1930s, the famine in Soviet Ukraine was an act of genocide on the part of Soviet leader Stalin.  Mace stated, in 1982, at an international conference on the Holocaust and genocide that the Ukrainian peasant, the Ukrainian language and the Ukrainian intellectuals needed to be destroyed, in order to centralize the power in the hands of Stalin.  All that was precalculated, it was no accident.

Even today, 75 years later, the Ukrainian famine is still doubted and denied by some because of the denials of the Soviet leadership and people like New York Times correspondent, Walter Duranty, who won a Pulitzer prize for falsifying the reality in Ukraine and lying instead that there was an abundant harvest.  Recently, for example, former Soviet dissident and Russian historian (who won the Nobel prize for revealing the horrors of the Soviet Gulag) Alexander Solzhenitsyn, attacked those who maintain that Ukraine endured a genocide in 1932-1933 contending that it's a `fairy tale' that was recently invented by anti-Russian forces to discredit the Russians.  Watch this DVD, and see who's inventing a fairy tale. Some of the countries that have acknowledged Holodomor are: Australia, Argentina, Georgia, Estonia, Italy, Canada, Lithuania, Poland, USA, and Hungary.

That films (including `Harvest of Despair'), photos, witnesses, and survivors document reality is evident, as the reader witnesses firsthand the horror and atrocities of a man-made famine; that the Russian Federation continues to deny that Holodomor (as the genocide-famine is called in Ukrainian) is an ethnic genocide, is still a harsh reality in 2008.

On April 2, 2008, the Russian resolution declared that the 1930s famine which was mainly in Soviet Ukraine and killed millions of peasants, shouldn't be considered genocide.  This resolution was passed by the Russian Federation Duma by a vote of 370 to 56 and was supported by Solzhenitsyn, who stated that historical proof that the famine was organized along ethnic lines was lacking.  Watch this DVD and look at all of the `historical proof' for yourself. Then, you, the reader, decide for yourself.

Regarding Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, Yuriy Lukanov, a freelance journalist and writer, wrote in the August 14, 2008 issue of Kyiv Post that regarding the Gulag Archipelago, the importance for Ukrainians was the description of fighters of UPA (the Ukrainian Insurgent Army)--for years, the Soviet propaganda machine had portrayed it as a nationalistic gang serving Hitler.  To this day, there are Ukrainians who continue repeating the communist stereotypes that were forced on them about the army that fought during World War II for an independent Ukraine, against both the Soviets and the Germans.  The truth is that Ukrainian partisans were sent straight to GULAG from forests where they had been caught.

At the time, Solzhenitsyn's positive description of the Ukrainian rebels (he wrote that the imprisoned UPA fighters were horrified by the slavery that reigned in the camps--and, that Ukrainians inspired and organized a series of revolts in the camps) was an inconceivable sin from the point of view of Soviet ideologists.  Just before the collapse of the USSR, after his return there, Solzhenitsyn stopped being a consistent critic of the Soviet system and suddenly started speaking against the dismantling of the Soviet Union.

Levko Lukianenko, a prisoner who had spent 26 years in camps, later said that Solzhenitsyn had been recruited by the secret services, and one of his reports foiled a rebellion planned by Ukrainian inmates.

Recently, Solzhenitsyn stated that the 1932-33 famine was not an act of genocide against Ukrainians--he was then accused of chauvinism. Earlier, in his Gulag Archipelago, he truthfully described many horrors of that famine; now, he was changing his rhetoric.

2008 marks the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor in Ukraine. As part of the commemoration, in Kyiv, Ukraine, after first being lit by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the International Holodomor Remembrance Torch will start its journey. It will travel through 33 countries throughout 2008...and, will visit Washington DC, the last leg of the Torch's tour of 23 U.S. cities, before reaching Ukraine in November 2008, where it will be part of the official state commemoration of the 75th anniversary of Ukraine's Genocide of 1932-1933.

Addendum--in the October 9, 2008 issue of News Blaze, in an article by Leah Dow about the Ukrainian Famine Exhibit, he stated that U. S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, David Kramer, on September 16, 2008, at the opening ceremony of the exhibit stated that the Holodomor was man-made.  He informed the public that President Bush, two years ago, signed legislation authorizing a Holodomor memorial to be built on federally owned land near the U.S. Capitol in Washington.  The National Capital Planning Commission approved the site on October 2, 2008.

According to the October 12, 2008 issue of The Ukrainian Weekly, the location of the Genocide Memorial in Washington, D. C. will be at the intersection of North Capitol Street, Massachusetts Avenue and F Street, in the NW quadrant of the District of Columbia--five blocks north of the U.S. Capitol.  The site is near Washington's Union Station and within walking distance of the Supreme Court, the U. S. Capitol, and the National Mall.

That same issue of The Ukrainian Weekly stated that the DVD `Harvest of Despair,' which came out over twenty years ago, is still considered the most authoritative documentary on the Famine.  The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its Consulate General in Toronto, has funded the production of 1,200 copies of a trilingual DVD of the film for the purpose of making it available to the delegations meeting for the 63rd General Assembly of the United Nations that began on September 16, 2008.  This will be the first time that the three language versions will be on one disc.  Hopefully, Amazon will soon be selling this version!

No, this is not `Wag the Dog,' but you'll be reminded of the `reality' vs. the `made-up reality.' Deserving accolades and acclaim worldwide for reporting the truth and history as they are--not as some would have you believe--definitely worth owning; definitely five stars plus!

8066407,5,B0009T2JJW,"This movie is not a quick and easy watch. It may haunt you for days as injustifyingly harrowing story you could never imagine to happen in real life. And not so long ago in 1932-33.
My grandmother was a survivor of those events. I heard the stories about that time from her. Its horrifying and unforgiving what was done by Soviets, by Stalin and his government. And really devastating that other countries leaders ignored it and haven't done anything substantial to help millions of innocent victims.
Thruth about HOLODOMOR needs to be revealed, publicized, taught in schools as a moral duty before the past and future generations of Ukrainians and as restoration of the historical justice.",1510099200,,690,4.956896551724138
8066408,5,B0009T2JJW,"Very good documentary about the ignored and forgotten Holocaust that no one in the media wants to mention.  It was one of Stalin's methods for implementing the ""workers' paradise.""  There were many, many others, such as the genocide of Armenians by the Muslim Turks or the Rape of Nanking.  All we ever hear seem to hear about is the Nazi Holocaust and the endless stream of movies to remind us.  We need more balanced reporting, recognition, and empathy for the victims of these other massacres.",1445644800,6,496,4.8
8066409,5,B0009T2JJW,"OMG!  This is one of the most tragic-but all too common-events that has happened in Russia and Nazi Germany and many other places and times throughout history; death by starvation is a very slow and miserable way to die. Due to the graphic theme and gut-wrenching brutality of this DVD I can not watch more than 5-10 minutes at a time; however, out of respect for the dead, I continue to view the DVD as long as possible. The story of the Ukrainian terror famine of 1932-33 which caused the deaths of 7 million people should be included in high school and college world history courses; it is an event that is one of this century's least-known but most vicious genocides. This event was deliberately created by the Soviet Government as part of Joseph Stalin's decades-long effort to exterminate the Ukrainian peasants who were against the forced collectivization of their lands.",1435708800,4,878,4.814569536423841
