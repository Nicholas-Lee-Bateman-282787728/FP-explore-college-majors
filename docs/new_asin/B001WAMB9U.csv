3826020,5,B001WAMB9U,why does this item cost so much on Amazon when you can go to the Les Stroud website and buy it for $19.99??,1313884800,8,107,3.6956521739130435
3826021,5,B001WAMB9U,"Really enjoyed this DVD.. whether you're a Les Stroud fan or not... who cares? I LOVED IT!
""Little House on the Prairie"" in ""REAL LIFE!""",1285718400,2,136,4.48
3826022,3,B001WAMB9U,"I first learned of Les Stroud through his TV program ""Survivorman"" which I really enjoyed.  When I read that he produced this documentary, ""Off the Grid,"" about his family's efforts to move into the Canadian wilderness and generate their own power, I decided I had to buy it.  The show is down-to-earth but really lacks much of a story.  It's like Les didn't quite finish it, and the film suddenly ends before the real end of the story.

To tell a more complete story, he should have done more planning and gone into more details about his family's surroundings and life in the city, first.  He should have also given a little more of the background of the area where they decided to move.  For instance, watching the DVD, we're led to believe he bought this property without any idea of whether there was usable well water.

The family's efforts to build a home in the forest had several setbacks, but it seemed like as soon as they had the house functioning, suddenly the credits appeared and the documentary was finished.  What happened next?  Was it everything they wanted?  Did they ever sell off their city house and live only in the cabin?  And what about their children?  Did they find other kids to spend time with, or are they growing up knowing only each other?

I got the feeling that Les shot a bunch of footage with a general idea in mind, and then had some deadline he rushed to meet and quickly edited what he had into something resembling a story.  But it's missing important parts before, during, and after their move off the grid.",1243814400,35,1549,4.5451263537906135

3826031,3,B001WAMB9U,"Good introduction for anyone wondering how off-grid life might look.  I thought the attention given to the well-being of the family was well done.  It's a romanticized existence with a lot of varied realities associated with it.  It's important that the viewers understand that this is only one families experience and cannot cover all variables that others have struggled with.  How they made it happen worked for them and they were fortunate to have the means at their disposal as well as a quick time frame.  The importance of friends and community helping was highlighted throughout and proved to be essential.  Whether your experience will efficient and easy or frustrating and discouraging is ultimately up to putting your best effort forward and being adaptable.  No doubt, it's a challenging endeavor, but the solitude and accomplishment are ultimately worth it.",1455667200,,870,5.215827338129497

3826042,2,B001WAMB9U,"I like Les Stroud, but unfortunately this short documentary suffers from being dated by modern standards, and not terribly complete or compelling.

3826045,1,B001WAMB9U,"Pros: for a newbie to self-sufficiency, you get to see some of the emotional challenges of going off-grid and some ideas for helping little kids adjust. They seem like a nice family.
Cons: Les must have had a lot of financial resources to start because almost everything was contracted out, never showing how to DIY anything. Nothing on food supply, very little on building and energy. I think it showed more video of the puddle and snow than of the building process itself. Secondly, a little melodramatic and sounded like he was the first and only to do this (been there, done that in 1990, without all the  expensive high tech gear). Lastly, the ending was awful; it just cut off, as if he ran out of video camera battery. Not really impressed and cannot recommend, sorry Les.",1412380800,3,779,4.644927536231884
3826046,4,B001WAMB9U,"Very much like survivorman expanded to include his family. It gives more of an outline of what it took for them to become self sufficient, with a few details along the way.

3826052,3,B001WAMB9U,I enjoyed the self documentary. I had hoped they would have shown more on their daily living after they moved in and being off the grid. Maybe Les Stroud will make another documentary.,1397347200,,184,4.606060606060606

3826056,3,B001WAMB9U,"""Off the Grid"" is a one-hour documentary featuring Les Stroud (from ""Survivorman"") and his family, following their attempts to create a self-sustaining homestead in the Canadian wilderness. They succeed eminently well...with some additional help from massive trucks, a chopper, a huge ""portable"" saw, and other high tech gadgets too numerous to mention. No, it's not ""wrong"" or ""immoral"" to cheat the Palaeolithic in this way (Native tribes love to purchase our guns and medicine, after all!), but how many people can afford to pay a million dollars, or whatever this operation might have cost, to go off the grid in *this* manner? Very few, I imagine. Perhaps if all the governments in the world get their acts together, we can all start living in this way...I honestly can't see that happening, though.

As usual, I loved the absurd stuff found in ""Off the Grid"". The former owners of the land used it for an illegal cannabis plantation, and even dumped a filled body bag in a local pond... We never learn what was in it. That competing cannabis smuggler the RCMP have been chasing all these years? The idea to have racoons as pets also struck me as hysterically absurd. It's also fascinating how many things can go wrong when you're trying to live closer to nature. Stroud and his family had to wear masks when demolishing the old house on their property, since it was filled with mouse feces infected by a string of potentially lethal diseases!

As I said, I certainly hope that we can transition to a more sustainable lifestyle in an orderly fashion (and even use helicopters to fly in some solar panels), but unfortunately, I suspect that the real process will prove to be bumpier than Survivorman's attempts to get off the grid...",1393718400,,1737,4.825503355704698
3826057,5,B001WAMB9U,"It gave me just what I hoped to get, which was another's perspective and info on what it's like for a real family starting up a solar home, hooking up on well water and raising a family... all off the grid.",1393286400,,206,4.048780487804878
3826058,4,B001WAMB9U,"I like Les Stroud from his other shows, this shows more of who he is. I found this to be very informative and explained well how they found the property, what were some of the issues that they faced and the reality of homesteading. He showed how difficult it was to balance his work and the building of the homestead and what some of the issues they will have living off the grid.
I think this should be required watching for anyone thinking about building off the grid or maybe even setting up a homestead.",1393113600,,507,4.347368421052631
3826059,4,B001WAMB9U,"Stroud is an expert in survival skills.  He feels we are going to run out of vital resources and we are woefully unprepared.  I'd agree.  The DVD follows the steps he took and the problems he needed to solve to be able to live off the grid.  It also had some personal things; home schooling his kids, his gutsy wife, his music.  Wish it went into more detail on how everything went after it was finally set up.  It is still an interesting DVD and worth the time to watch.  There needs to be alternatives to how we are living now.  I would think people who have resources, if things break down, will be very vulnerable to those who find themselves without.",1392940800,,655,4.311475409836065
3826060,4,B001WAMB9U,I like Les Stroud a lot sometimes I think he gets a little too environmental when he does his survivor man and does not kill food to eat but chooses to eat edibles. But that's my opinion anyways this was a neat show learn quite a bit from it.,1391731200,,242,3.9591836734693877
3826061,2,B001WAMB9U,"I really enjoy Les Stroud's stuff but I thought this was a mess. You're not ""off grid"" if you use propane. If the ""grid"" goes down, the propane tanks can't be filled unless your propane vendor is solar powered. LOL! And how would you get the tanks refilled? Walk? Ski? The ""grid"" is down. There's no hydro (electric). Hello? Or is this for when the grid goes down for a few days? Let's say the grid is down and you need a part for your solar system what then? You can't call them. They can't process your order.

Or is this about how to live in the bush when you can afford a helicopter to move a cabin for you? WTH?

I promise you that Les and his wife move back to the city when they get older. As soon as their kids are older they'll move, too.

I guess I don't like novelty. This just seemed to be a poorly planned and executed video blog/diary.",1389571200,,849,4.102409638554217
3826062,3,B001WAMB9U,"It was ok but I expected Les to do more of the work, he hired much of it out. Any one with money can just hire contractors.",1389312000,,123,3.5925925925925926
3826063,1,B001WAMB9U,"The movie subject was neat in that a family documented their move from the suburbs to living out in the country off the grid, but the way they did it was completely un realistic. All of the steps they took to complete this project would have cost thousands upon thousands of dollars and made it look so easy! Whenever they came across a problem, his fat wallet saved the day. Building a home to be ""off grid"" ready is by no means cheap.  The guy even called in a helicopter to come move their building materials when they couldn't haul it in by car.  Who has those kind of means but people with so much money they don't know what else to do with it? Poor example of sustainable living.",1388793600,9,685,4.2615384615384615

3826068,4,B001WAMB9U,"Wow. A helicopter to bring in supplies! While I think that's awesome to have those kinds of resources, most people wouldn't. Good for him though...

That said - I am currently comfortably ""off the grid"" and loving it. I have only a few acres set in the middle of several hundred of state land - and I have a gravel road not far from my door - but - truly, I can't understand why more people don't use solar. I am a 62-year-old female - and I live with solar power EXTREMELY comfortably!

The documentary is correct to show what people face with going off-grid in modern society. Some will approach it with more resources than others. I currently have to dig a well, as well - and deal with a 100+ farm house's ""issues"". Les has children and other issues that will confront him. It's exactly what it purports to be - ""one man's story of going off the grid"". Your story and my story will be different as well - it doesn't invalidate his or his family's experience.",1373414400,16,962,4.338888888888889
3826069,4,B001WAMB9U,"As much experience as Les Stroud has with bushcraft, outdoor survival and primitive living (ex: his one year honeymood off-the-grid), he clearly demonstrates that the idea of having a sustainable, ecological, zero-footprint life just outside of society is impractical without a larger community to help make this possible.

A key statement Les makes in this documentary is that, even with being off the grid you still have to make money, to buy and maintain alt power, toilet systems, rain catchment systems, etc.  So he buys logs from a mill instead of harvesting to save time, because he has films and music to make.  He runs a generator to run his recording session because the show must go on.  These are real concerns.

If one is to go off the grid completely, one must expect to 'run out' of consumables such as fuel, toothbrushes, toothpaste, food that you don't yourself grow, solar panels if they break; etc. Essentially, the key lesson learned in this documentary, which is also the reason I think this documentary is great, is that even if you have a lot of money to get set up well, you will eventually 'become a primitive bushman' because all of modernity will disappear once your burn through your income and don't have any residual or supplemental income coming in.  Sustainability, in essence is chasing a dream.  Society, which is another way of saying, the larger community, is the key to sustainability.  Sorry.

Of course, you could always become a farmer and sell / barter, and that's a good option also.  This is an example of community that makes your efforts sustainable.

I like this documentary because it deflates the alluring freedom promising, yet naive dream of becoming a sovereign, self-sufficient human living off the land with a reality check, brought to you by a veteran bushman who knows a thing or two about being lost in the woods, thousands of miles from society.  If you are expecting Dick Proenneke's Alone in the Wilderness or Alaska the last frontier, this is not it, it's far more practical advice for the everyman.",1373328000,10,2059,4.851428571428571
