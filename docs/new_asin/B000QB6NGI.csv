8195294,5,B000QB6NGI,sky lab dvd. has 3 movies on it. two by independent companies and one by NASA. All don't tell the truth about all the things that went on in skylab. They only cover the launch of the shroud breaking one of the solar panels. they don't interview the astronauts that went up.,1447286400,,273,4.269230769230769
8195295,4,B000QB6NGI,"In the days of HD everything and megapixel video cameras on cellphones it can be a little painful to watch these old analog recordings. However this is still great footage of one of the largest manned habitats we have launched into orbit. The ""DVD"" is basically a collection for 3 old school educational videos. It's cool to see some of the experiments they were doing like running around the perimeter and throwing stuff around. This was made out of a leftover stage from an Altas V and it turned out to be a semi-useful orbiting laboratory...if only we would do something this cool today.",1316995200,,590,4.6826923076923075
