All of Orman's books are so practical I wonder why we aren't all wealthy.  It is a great book and I do recommend the book, it is  a very good book for young people or couples starting out planning their financial future.",1419811200,3,361,4.028169014084507

Suze Orman is a motivational speaker with a specialty in personal finance and money matters. She's regularly seen on cable TV and every few years produces a special for PBS, usually at Pledge Break time. This DVD is the show that aired on PBS in January 2011 so it is current - for those reading this review in early 2011.

Recorded with a live studio audience in Minnesota, Orman starts out with a ""lecture"" on how to ""cope"" with the ""new economy"" where real estate prices are going down, personal debt is going up, banks are paying little return on investments and the job market looks bleak. The look on the faces of the audience shows no emotion. These are folks who are in a rut and need help. They look to Orman for this help. And, if you are in this situation, this DVD may help you become motivated too.

When I'm not reviewing music and entertainment items for Amazon, I'm a CPA with as small tax practice. So, all that Orman espouses in this 77-minute show (which, of course was padded with ""pledge breaks"" to two-hours when it was aired) is familiar to me. She knows her stuff and is an entertaining, and compassionate, speaker. When the audience gets to ask questions later in the program, they will probably be questions YOU would ask....... If you own a home, have student loans, are ready for retirement or, in a somewhat offbeat subject for personal finance shows, give your kids an ""allowance"".

If you missed this on TV, this is a good chance to hear and see Orman. (Especially if you don't have cable TV to watch her show on CNBC.

There are no bonus features on the DVD but there is a chapter selection so you can return to certain sections.
