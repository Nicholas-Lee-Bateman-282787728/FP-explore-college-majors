7721623,1,B01DPPLVKE,This movie was awful. This was a waste of 90 minutes. I wish there was a zero rating.,1467504000,3,85,3.7777777777777777
7721624,1,B01DPPLVKE,GARBAGE. I'd rather watch grass grow in the desert. 100% 6th grade amateur film making. Terrible story line. So damn boring.,1467244800,2,124,4.9523809523809526
7721625,2,B01DPPLVKE,"I watched the whole thing although I found it ludicrous. Poor acting, poor plot; just an opportunity to show violence. I don't have a problem watching a violent movie if there's a story to go with it. I would've given it 1 1/2 points because I didn't quite hate it 100%.",1484006400,5,270,4.313725490196078
7721626,5,B01DPPLVKE,I enjoyed this movie. Not to bad at all. Loved the ending.,1482192000,,58,3.9166666666666665
7721627,2,B01DPPLVKE,"It was an ok movie right up until the very end.  Had an interesting twist I wasn't expecting towards the end, but the last minute or so totally ruined the whole move with a master plan that plain and simply was totally.stupid and would have no chance of success.",1479686400,2,262,4.346938775510204

7721630,5,B01DPPLVKE,"What's with all the negative reviews?  Everyone thinks he's a critic AND his job is to bash everything he watches!

I absolutely LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!

What a twist!!!!!!  What a weak, but endearing, protagonist there..............oops, but wait..............is it he or is it not?

YOu gotta watch this movie.

I watched the trailer, and it was AWFUL!  THAT music almost drove me away.  But I read one comment that said ""I had it on in the background while I was doing something else, and it was okay"" and decided to watch it just that way.  After awhile, I decided to start paying attention.  That awful music is gone from the first five minutes on, and the rest of the soundtrack is a complement to the movie.

Those who left negative reviews PROBABLY only stuck with it for the first five minutes.  I'm delighted I stayed til the end!  You will be too!

It's a combination of Logan's Run, and Gattaca and every 80s SciFi movie that we just loved to love.

Then there's a pretty girl, who's a cross between Helen Hunt, Katie Holmes and some really hot girl-next-door.

Ignore all the naysayers.  Put this on, sit back and actually WATCH IT.  GREAT FLICK, guys!

I'm so glad I got amazon prime, cause Netflix does NOT have anything like this!",1477699200,3,1251,4.63013698630137

7721632,5,B01DPPLVKE,Good twist. Lots of fun.,1475539200,,24,4.0
7721633,4,B01DPPLVKE,Great job considering the low low budget. Can't wait to see what these guys can do with a little cash on their side!,1474675200,,116,4.086956521739131
7721634,4,B01DPPLVKE,"The sound effects and techno music so very annoying. 5 years after the fall starts slow and stays that way. However, I watched it while keeping busy doing other things, paying just enough attention to get by. The last 15 minutes or so are pretty darn good and make the movie worth the watch. In the end, I had to say, it was a pretty good flick with a twist ending.",1474416000,2,365,4.154929577464789
7721635,4,B01DPPLVKE,"Excellent premise, flow and story. They should have taken that AE money and spent it on this script. This would have been way better. Good story, lousy budget!",1474329600,,159,4.714285714285714

7721638,3,B01DPPLVKE,"Taken for what it is, a campy flick, it was a fun watch. I really enjoyed the twist.",1470096000,,84,3.7222222222222223
7721639,3,B01DPPLVKE,"Fair si-fi movie, but lacks excitement.",1469923200,,39,5.666666666666667
7721640,1,B01DPPLVKE,"The film starts out in a futuristic society that is walled in from the outside world which has poisoned land and people traveling in gangs becoming cannibals to survive. A train derailment places our civilized protagonist (Zorba Dravillas) outside of the city in a fight for his life... all inside one shack.

What you realize is that the film spent its entire budget in the first 15 minutes and winged it from there in rural Ontario with a bunch of ""Deliverance"" rejects. Acting and script was bad. Worth a hacker's bunch. What was the whole point? There are no zombies as depicted on the DVD cover art.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1469836800,4,638,4.6371681415929205
7721641,1,B01DPPLVKE,Worst of the worst.,1469318400,,19,4.0

7721643,5,B01DPPLVKE,I am still feeling chills from this movie. The acting and special effects had to have been done by an unlisted professional like Oprah.,1468713600,,135,4.666666666666667
7721644,4,B01DPPLVKE,"nicely done, would recommend",1468627200,,28,6.25
8756622,1,B01DPPLVKE,"Hilariously bad film written by by people who fancy themselves revolutionaries.  It's worth watching just for the comically bad acting, terrible writing and even more horrible plot.  This is what it looks like when antifa decides to make a film.",1536019200,,245,5.1
8756623,3,B01DPPLVKE,Not the greatest acting but an interesting character study up until the plot twist. And why is the sound track half a second ahead of the lip movement?,1527897600,,151,4.428571428571429
8756624,3,B01DPPLVKE,"Decent semi-apocalypse with a fairly fresh take. Acting, writing, and techincals are on the better side for an indie production. They took some chances with some twists, and for the most part they pay off. They don't shy away from the violence, and they don't spare the children. If that kind of thing bothers you in your movies, you may want to steer clear. If you're a fan of post-apocalypse movies, have at it.",1500163200,,413,4.594594594594595
8756625,1,B01DPPLVKE,You have to be awful for me not to give a Zombie movie at least a 3. Congrats,1498867200,,77,3.3333333333333335
8756626,2,B01DPPLVKE,"I only give it two stars because I've definitely seen worse and it was at least tolerable. However, the ""twist"" was not unexpected, it went in slightly a different direction than I predicted, however, from the moment it was revealed nothing was a surprise. Music was bad, effects were extremely low quality and the ""OMG GMO's ruined the world!!!"" was really lame.",1494979200,,363,4.870967741935484
8756627,4,B01DPPLVKE,"The movie plot twist, at the end, was unrealistic. The script needed work....but I have seen a LOT WORSE ( script and acting )!
Movie was OK, otherwise.
Certainly not the worst movie on Amazon Prime.

***SPOILER ALERT***

Since the girl knew the guy would get her in the city, and was rich, why would she enact the plan she did....to save the Bad Guys men....the same ones who ate her friends....LOL.",1493683200,,400,4.541666666666667
8756628,2,B01DPPLVKE,"2 1/4 stars.  2 1/2 with a brisk tailwind.  About half the reviewers liked this one and the other half swung the other way.  I'm somewhere in the lower to middle group.  There was plenty of unnecessary violence.  I kind of wondered how the sheltered dweeb protagonist was suddenly an expert with an AR-15.  The flashback rendered the final 20  minutes convoluted. The final minute was completely implausible and in my opinion splashed the entire movie.  I almost wished I could ""unwatch"" this one.",1493251200,,497,4.833333333333333
