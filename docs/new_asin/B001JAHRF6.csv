3656085,4,B001JAHRF6,It was another season the was really the official season of change. And I think it showed to be a good transition like in season 2 for what you would come to expect in season 3. Season 7 though to me in more ways gave the best interest as far as how every thing would be handled with everyone made for this first episode of the season to be of interest story line wise. Andy Sipowicz now being a widower now taking care of his son and what could possibly happen there. And seeing how Danny Sorenson would possibly play off to everyone that watches NYPD Blue. This first episode of season proved that all to be true and to me was the real start to be every ones interest in the change that turned out to be good.,1333929600,5,711,4.122302158273381

3656181,5,B001JAHRF6,One of the most down to earth police shows I've ever seen. I only found out about the program when I inadvertantly found it on Direct TV. They were showing one episode each night Monday through Friday. It's something that re-acquaints me with the language of New York that I miss now living in Georgia. The New York Language is totally different from the Georgia Language that sometimes is not understood. I would rate this show as five star as well as Blue Bloods and Chicago PD. All these shows delve into real police work and it's great.,1461110400,,540,4.520408163265306

The violence doesn't contribute to the series but seems to be that the producers are trying to see how much they can get away with without having to issue a adult rating.  Having been in intelligence work I enjoy seeing realistic shows but there just isn't that much blood and guts in real life situations.

3656765,5,B001JAHRF6,"Much of what I love about this series is of value to recovering alcoholics. It goes without saying that Andy's behavior reflects what is known as a dry drunk personality, someone who isn't drinking but continues to project their anger, fear and distrust on to everyone around him. He has a perfect excuse to play the role of a bad cop. It is not contributing to his well-being in the long run, but it is of great value to witness how difficult dry drunk behavior makes it on everyone in the ""family"". I have watched every season, some on TV years ago, but I will finish the rest of the seasons on Amazon. Thank you for continuing to offer this series.",1429315200,,651,4.3884297520661155

3656797,5,B001JAHRF6,"Every season of this show, the finest police drama ever broadcast on network television (although, if it survives long enough, ""Elementary"" may give it a run for its money), gets five stars from me.

Some of my very favorite episodes of this whole series came in season 7.  They sprinkled a little more comic relief into the mix, and I always like that aspect of this show.  One episode in particular, entitled ""Lucky Luciano,"" features the always amusing character actor Richard Libertini (Remember in the Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin treat ""All of Me?""  He was the guy who said, ""Back in bowl."") as the Italian immigrant Luciano, who Andy suspects killed his wife, or at least ""egged on"" his wife's cousin to do it.  Andy also suspects that he is not really Italian and tries to startle him as he ""takes a crap"" (his words), trying to get him to shout out some exclamation without the accent by suddenly banging violently on the stall door.  It doesn't work, but unbeknownst to any of us, Medavoy is trying to defecate in the next stall, and becomes rather disturbed at Andy's antics here.

Much of this season features Danny Sorensen screwing up his relationship with that nice Mary Franco despite her herculean efforts to keep him from doing it.  The travails of Jill Kirkendall with her slimeball husband also set the stage for the coming of the painfully delicious Connie McDowell (Charlotte Ross) to the squad, who Andy later marries.

I am really glad that Amazon Prime is carrying this entire series, the later seasons of which are not yet available on DVD.  The technical quality of their reproductions of the earlier seasons is noticeably higher than the one presented on the DVD sets.",1427414400,,1692,4.783505154639175

3656845,5,B001JAHRF6,"Like most, I've waited awhile for the remaining seasons to release - well worth the wait. This was one of the few seasons I managed to watch when the show was on prime time - I had to catch the rest through syndication.

I'm still amazed at how this show kept up for so long at such a high level. I remember not liking Rick Shroder back in the day, big let down from Jimmy Smits and David Caruso. Giving a few years however, I have to say he was pretty darn good in his own way. It may be me but it seems like they ramped up the humor in the dialog between Sipowicz and Sorenson. Didn't see that with Simone or Kelly so much. Nice touch.

Great packaging. This is the way all DVD sets should be.

My only misgiving is with so many years passing since the show's been on the air it's not likely we'll see many special features. Too bad, I always enjoyed watching those.",1426118400,,868,4.094117647058823

Keep in mind that the language is a little tough at times (although by today standards it might be so bad), due to the brief nudity, suggestions to sex etc., this definitely is something you do not want your children to see.  I like it because you are not jumping all over the place, with case going to court and having to watch that scenario also.  It does bounce around at times to up to three things going on at the same time.  Also keep in mind is a TV show for entertainment and cases get solved often the same day as per story line.  I like the different cases, the acting seems fair+, etc.  For me just good entertainment.  No, or when it has it is not done well, real comedy. Also I doubt ruffing up the bad guy as depicted here would be allowed.",1414800000,,863,4.131736526946108

3657066,5,B001JAHRF6,"I no longer watch TV--no cable or satellite or even rabbit ears--and I don't have much of an internet connection, none of the fancy streaming stuff for me, so I'm totally dependent on DVD to be able to enjoy good old television, not to mention the best damn drama ever produced for that medium.  I bought the first four seasons of NYPD Blue years ago and have begged and pleaded with everyone I could find to release the other eight seasons.  Finally SHOUT came along and I quickly snatched up 5 and 6...but then the same old foot-dragging crap started again.  There have been two 'delays' (so far) since I pre-ordered Season 7 and now it looks like I'm going to be starting on my 75th year before I get that package.  Is there any chance I'll actually get the entire show, all 12 years, before I die?  PLEASE!!!  PLEASE!!!  PLEASE!!!

...and I finally got it.  This season of NYPD Blue aired in 2000 which was right around the time my growing disaffection with television was getting a firm foothold, and I learned as I watched this long-awaited DVD that while some of the episodes seemed a little like 'old friends long out of touch' others were completely new to me.  All of them are great, of course, but I was especially happy to (a) see the gang do a totally comedic episode thanks to the guest appearance of the great Richard Libertini, (b) finally learn what actually happened, and how, to cause Andrea Thompson to leave the cast taking her Jill (""nobody counts except me and mine"") role, which she admirably played to perfection, with her, and (c) catch a glimpse of Elizabeth Berkeley's (Showgirls) fine bare ass as she and Henry Simmons did a steamy bedroom scene....though of course that scene still doesn't hold a candle to the beautiful Sharon Lawrence's two nude scenes with star Dennis Franz--the shower scene and the even better ""just don't do your Tarzan yell"" bedroom scene.  I just can't get enough of this show and I hope Shout! delivers the rest of the seasons before my time on this planet expires.",1410998400,6,2021,4.6016713091922

3657070,4,B001JAHRF6,the only reason i give 4 stars instead of my usual 5 is that by this time the character portrayed by andrea thompson i found to be boring and rather sad in general.  the writers seemed to abandon giving her a chance to expand in the role.  i don't know but i remember she exited the show a la mr caruso.  so who knows.

The characters are mixed with a well-written script and the acting very fluid from scene to scene. However, I must point out that there is occasional nudity and graphic crime scenes for the faint-hearted.

I would recommend to anyone interested in police drama and relaxing entertainment.",1403308800,,416,4.942857142857143
3657139,3,B001JAHRF6,"Too late, Shout Factory--I bought Seasons 7-12 from the Brits (Amazon.co.uk) after Shout Factory gave me the runaround when I asked if there'd be any more beyond Season 6 (which is now in transit after being released today). The price is comparable so the only extra cost is an entry-level Sony player I tacked onto the order (that cost me the value of 1-1/2 of one of these sets). I can understand (sort of) their reluctance to jump in with both feet too hastily--manufacturing costs and all--but that doesn't allow for competitors getting the jump on you if you move too slowly. Funny how everybody in here is declaring Shout Factory to be God. A ""god"" that moves at glacial speed. Well they sold me one season with another due to show up here 3 days from now. But once Season 7 comes out in September--or so I've heard--I'll already have them all.

Which is obviously the source of all the more recent reviews here. Which wasn't the case until Shout Factory picked up the rights. So it's possible that Shout Factory provided Amazon with the downloads for it. I've been over to Shout Factory's site to ask them if there was some sort of timetable for release of the last 6 seasons in DVD, but they hedged on me and sent me a link to their ""future releases"" page. So they must be adopting a wait-and-see stance pending how their first two releases of Seasons 5 and 6 sell. Who knows how long that will take? Well, I've done my part--I just got the Shout Factory edition of Season 5 and their Season 6 is in my Shopping Cart waiting to be ordered when it comes out. As for this set and the last 5 seasons, I'm not waiting around any more. I went over to the UK site earlier this week and ordered Seasons 7-12 in Region 2 format. As for how to play them, it's a good thing an affordable player costs less than twice what each of these sets costs--over there as well as here. It may seem extravagant to buy a separate player for purposes of 3 dozen discs, but who knows? Maybe if I come across any more flicks in Region 2 format but aren't in our format, I won't have to pass on them. I'll have a player in that second format in my setup.",1401667200,,1469,4.2313167259786475

However, two new characters (Danny Sorenson played by Ricky Shroder and Baldwin Jones played by Henry Simmons) have captivated my interest. Perhaps most interesting of all is Andy Sipwicz, played by Dennis Franz, as an older detective who continues to grow and learn as he struggles with nearly overwhelming life challenges. The strengths of this series are great acting and fascinating development of individual characters and their relationships. The ""police procedural"" aspect of this show is nothing special.

3657234,5,B001JAHRF6,"NYPD Blue was one of the most authentic television dramas ever produced. Unlike the shallow, crap today that seems to require super models as police officers and comedy every 6.3 minutes, NYPD was true to life. A show called ""The Shield"" managed to draw a large following with average looking actors as well. My only gripe with The Shield is the over-the-top criminal activity the team got away with day in and day out with no casualties until the last one or two seasons. NYPD Blue had casualties throughout the 12 or 13 seasons that it aired and the stars were not runway models. They looked like regular people doing a regular job. This is the same appeal that draws people to the Sci-Fi drama ""The Walking Dead"". They are everyday looking people who don't feel the need to crack jokes every 6.3 minutes.

Other than NYPD Blue which seems true-to-life and the Sci-Fi drama ""The Walking dead"" many other shows are saturated with over-the-top pretentious crap. I am turned off by shows involving serious, life-and-deatrh issues that feel the need for comedy relief every few minutes even while engaged with very serious issues. Most shows are like ""Abbot and Costello Meet The Serial Killer"". The slap-stick stupidity ruins the serious moments. Because I know comedy is going to occur throughout the program I do not allow myself to get to deeply engaged with the plot which makes me care even less about the outcome. This new generation of writers suck beyond belief. I assume they use focus groups to determine how many jokes should be cracked per a single crime show episode. The only thing missing are the old laugh-tracks from older comedy shows such as Three's Company or Gilligan's Island. NCIS should add the Three's Company laugh track to their stupid, corny, no-need-to-be there, comedy routines.

3657269,5,B001JAHRF6,After almost 20 years watching this series is as entertaining as it was originally.  Many shows after a period of time seem a little silly because they are dated and the subject matter has become trite.  This series watches the same as it did when first aired and is still as entertaining!,1388707200,,289,4.538461538461538

3657271,3,B001JAHRF6,"The stories are shallow and have no depth.  Occasionally there are interesting ""moments"" within the show but those are few.

3657314,5,B001JAHRF6,"Dennis Franz is the glue that holds this old, but not dated series together.  That is not to say the rest of the cast isn't good; they're great, but Franz's portrayal of a deeply flawed policeman, who despite his flaws, remains honest  and true to his profession and his fellow policemen is one of the greatest character portrayals on any TV series of any time.  Leading characters came and went, and they were good actors who gave outstanding performances and we missed them when they left, mourned them, but  Franz' portrayal of Sipowitz remains the best.  He's the character you love, even when his political incorrectness makes you wince.  He is the policeman you wanted on your side when you were seeking justice and he is the policeman you'd least want to meet if you were the perp.  NYPD Blue is an ensemble show, and as previously stated, all are great, but Sipowitz, with all his flaws, and all his humanity, remains the reason  this is one of the greatest TV shows ever.",1380412800,28,980,4.624277456647399
3657315,5,B001JAHRF6,"I love NYPD Blue because it's so well written, has such great talent, and it is not overwhelmed with sex scenes.  Yes it contains some, but it's not all the time.  The stories are about people on the street and the everyday happenings of a cop shop.  Simply one of the best shows of its kind out there.",1379894400,,302,4.172413793103448
3657316,5,B001JAHRF6,"The previous season to this one was rough for fans of NYPD Blue.  Everyone knew Bobby Simone would be written out early in the season, as Jimy Smits had decided to move on.  This knowledge in no way made the slow, sad death of Bobby any easier to bear.  Then, shockingly, Andy's wife of several seasons, Sylvia, is gunned down before the season finale, adding to the list of tragedies heaped on his shoulders.  Maybe because of the heaviness of these episodes, Season 7 has an overall lighter tone, while keeping the gritty nature the show was always known for.  James Martinez exits the show after getting promoted to sergeant.  To fill his spot, the character of Baldwin Jones, who would remain until the series' end, is introduced.  Danny Sorenson has a relationship with fellow cop Mary Franco, but gradually gets closer to Diane.  Danny's self-destructive tendencies become more evident, foreshadowing his downfall by the end of Season 8.  Season 7 has some excellent episodes, and just like the rest of the seasons, benefits from incredibly high quality writing and acting.  This was a fantastic season of one of TV's truly great dramas.",1379548800,19,1143,4.875647668393782

This was not the quality I have come to expect.  Also, the lack of CC on all episodes was frustrating.  Audio did not seem as clear as in past episodes.  This series is very entertaining and would recommend it to anyone enjoying drama and good acting.

3657396,5,B001JAHRF6,"When NYPD Blue first arrived on network television in the early 1990s I was one of those people who gave it a pass, mainly because I wasn't interested in the ""adult content."" I had enough problems of my own to deal with without watching lots of slop on TV as well. Some friends watched it and told me that I would probably enjoy it because the stories were so good even though they were fairly harsh at times. Still, I didn't watch it for a couple years.

When I did I was sorry I'd waited. Not because of the sexual and violent content, but because it was so well written. The characters were so well fleshed out that they became very real to me. And I knew a few cops in my hometown and they were the same way! They seemed to have the same flaws even though they were committed to keeping our streets safe.

By season 7 these guys were like old friends. Sipowicz has gone through two partners by now and the entire squad looks pretty different from the earliest days of the show. The production moved into a groove that remained until the end of the series- even after David Milch left. The stories, cocredited to Bill Clark, had a cohesion that kicked the whole series up a notch or two.

If I remember right this was Milch's last season but he wasn't coasting through it. There are some great stories and some character developments that network TV wouldn't have been able to do prior to NYPD Blue. The care given to each storyline is amazing even though I'm sure many details were dropped because the writers couldn't jam every bit of detail into the scripts. Still, the series is like a novel for television that lasted 12 years and around 300 episodes. This season hits some plot points that play out over a long time.

I'm more and more convinced that NYPD Blue was the best show on television and still holds up better than anything else produced in the 1990s.",1367107200,,1869,4.393063583815029
