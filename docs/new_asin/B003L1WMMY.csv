8630481,3,B003L1WMMY,"The video has several moves to learn but I wouldn't recommend this for someone that wants to move at a slow pace or for someone that wants to learn more than moves. The video simply shows how to to do different spins, holds, inverts, and a few exercises. There are three different people in the video, two women, and one man that vary showing different moves. The instructor demonstrates the move then walks you through how to do it and then they do it again while naming the steps in the process. The setting of the DVD is plain and what looks like a free standing pole in front of a white draped sheet, which looks very cheap. There are definitely better videos out there than this one but if you want to have to pause the DVD after each move and simply want to learn pole moves then go ahead and buy it. I would recommend one of Leigh Ann's videos instead that incorporate a dance style into pole dancing.",1300320000,2,908,4.315789473684211
