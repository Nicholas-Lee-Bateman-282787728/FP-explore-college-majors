5529194,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This was a perfect description of Japan in the 60's. Studio Ghibli doesn't disappoint their audiences with such an unraveling story that i had to watch it back to back. It was that good. Anyways if your looking forward to this being released in the US then you should buy this first just to try it out. The subtitles are pretty slow at times so if your a beginner then this is perfect for you. Goro Miyazaki didn't do such a bad job, this reminds me of Whisper of the Heart. If your a Ghibli fan and you wanna see a sneak peek then purchase this cause the current price of 15 bucks is a good buy.",1347148800,,596,4.102564102564102
5529195,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Beautiful movie! I loved it! It was featured last year at the Toronto International Film Festival. I adored the ""simplicity"" of the story, which only makes it more beautiful. I have watched it many times now. I would totally recommend it to people that like and value this kind of japanese anime as well as beautiful and honest stories. I absolutely adored that this version I purchased through Amazon is in its original language (japanese) with english subtitles.",1345248000,2,464,4.961538461538462
5529196,5,B00AZI9JP4,"As a devoted Studio Ghibli fan, I was thrilled that I could order this dvd rather than wait for the movie's release in the U.S. in March '13.  This film is more in the reality-based Ghibli films such as ""Only Yesterday"".  While visually it is not as stunning as some of the studio's other work, it is still very beautiful and does not disappoint.  That along with the strong narrative, delightful humor, and depiction of life in Japan in the 1960s makes this a must see for Ghibli fans and everyone else who will become a Ghibli fan after seeing this movie.",1345248000,6,557,4.4411764705882355
5529197,5,B00AZI9JP4,"The time period is after Japan was rebuilt following World War II. Its wonderful scenery invites you to be part of it. It gives us a glimpse of Japan, I believe it was early 1960's. You can't help but enjoy this story. It also has a romantic element to it, but you're never quite sure of how that'll turn out, even though you want to see it somehow work out. The teenage boy and girl think they're related, so that's a no-go for them. It's beautifully told, and of course, a Studio Ghibli product.",1525046400,,497,4.297872340425532

5529213,4,B00AZI9JP4,"This is a heartwarming Studio Ghibli production about two young Japanese people who are in love and who are coming to terms with their seemingly related family histories.  Their story, which takes place shortly before the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, expertly demonstrates how Japan recovered from the deadly aftermath of the Korean War.  Even though the movie lacks a Totoro, a castle in the sky or any other fantastical elements typically found in Studio Ghibli productions, I found it to be as involving and heartwarming as the best of them.",1506384000,,539,4.977777777777778

5529222,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This one is a really nice one. The story is simple and shows what was Japan in the 60s. Although not born or raised in Japan, it brought good memories from my childhood when my family talked about Japan; and even not being fluent in Japanese anymore (my mother tongue), could easily understand the dialogues, contrary to other more modern animes that use the Japanese currently spoken in Japan which contains more English words than Japanese and many slang that is unknown to me.

The music and songs are from the 60s and are very familiar to me, except for the closing song, which is - that's my understanding - not from that era, but sung in a more traditional Japanese that allowed me to understand the lyrics. And it is very very beautiful, but also liked very much that White Flower That I Miss (not sure if this is the correct title) song that the students sing at the debate meeting.

A note about the subtitles and the original Japanese soundtrack: some reviewers complained that there is no voice over at the beginning of the movie because they saw subtitles in English but no Japanese monologue from Umi, the main female character. This is because there are, actually two subtitles: English Cast subtitle and Original Cast subtitle (both English subtitles).

The English Cast subtitle actually reproduces the English dubbed soundtrack, which has a voiced over at the beginning of the movie; now if Original Cast subtitle is selected, the subtitle follows the original Japanese soundtrack, which does not have a voice over at the beginning of the movie.

This is so, in my opinion, because the English soundtrack was created to explain things for the viewers who are not familiar with Japan of that era.

With that said, it seems to me that there is no problems with the Japanese soundtrack.or the subtitles.

UPDATE: Forgot to mention that the Original Cast subtitle has a bonus: the last song (Summer of Farewells) at the end of the movie has its lyrics included in the subtitle, which is missed in the English Cast subtitle",1496361600,7,2035,4.7507082152974505

5529231,5,B00AZI9JP4,"""From Up on Poppy Hill"" may not be my favorite Ghibil film (that right will probably always stay with ""Howl's Moving Castle"") , but I think it's a film I could say represts a very hard part of my life. Have you ever watched a film and truely simpathized with a certain character? Ever had a film represent your emotions so keenly that you couldn't help but cry? Whelp, this was my movie. This movie also came very unexpected for me since usual fans of Ghibli expect some form of 'fantastical' in their films - which this came from basically the opposite end of the spectrum in. This movie is VERY grounded in reality compared to the rest of the studios' work....which I honestly found refreshing. This movies worries less about astounding you (which is not to say that this movie isn't GORGEOUS) but focuses on drawing you into the characters and reading subtle facial expressions of people not necessarily in the forefront of the scene; THAT is the true beauty of this movie. Ghibli refocuses on character driven stories in ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", not throwing money at the screen to fill movie theater seats (not saying that's a bad thing...). Now, I wouldn't say this movie will impact everyone that watches it the same way it did for me, but I will say it IS worth giving it a shot. If nothing else, hardcore fans will be able to check it off their lists as another Ghibli movie watched. As for me, it will always stand as a reminder of understanding that crossed from one of my favorite studio's into my reality of loosing a dear parent at a very young age. Love this movie for the subtleties in the main character that reflected in myself after growing up in tragedy.
If anything, this film has to be experienced to really get the impact across. So, if any of this peeked your interest, I'd say try and then buy!",1491868800,,1819,4.481927710843373

5529240,4,B00AZI9JP4,"Watch the movie with the Japanese dub with the english subtitles for the japanese dub.  The english dub and english subtitles was not a translation.  Many little Japanese cultural contexts were changed in the english dub.  the original Japanese dub did not have the intro. the english dub was added the intro because Gkids felt Americans didn't understand the japanese cultural context. i watch the movie in both japanese and english. i also compared the subtitles. the english dub is not a direct translation of japanese dub. lines of dialog were changed from the original japanese dub. for example near the beginning during breakfast. in the english dub, one of the girls said ""im starved"". in japanese, she said ""thanks for the food"".  The specific phrase to give thanks for the food is a very japanese specific phrase which wasn't translated in the english dubs.  Historically hayao miyazaki was very against changing the context in the dub, i guess Goro his son doesnt mind?

Pretty much all Ghibli movies are above average.  This one is probably one of the lower ranked Ghibli movies. No where near top notch. But not bad.  Its not as imaginative or creative as other Ghibli movies.  The movie is just a heart felt story that is very straight forward and does require the viewer to think much.  If you watch it in the english dub, its even more straight forward with the change in dialog and intro. All the info is revealed to you in the japanese dialog. basically the narrator is telling you what the story is about so you don't have to discover it by watching the movie. what fun is that? overall it was an enjoyable movie. probably less depth than other Ghibli movies. If you're a Ghibli nerd, some of the Ghibli movies appear childish, it examines and/or questions the a commonly held perception or japanese reality. For example in Grave of the Fireflies, it showed that social isolation can be your slow death. This was to parallel the rise of the otakus and the evaporating people of Japan during the 1980s. Even Miyazaki's last film The Wind Rises showed us that even with the transience of our lives, we must follow our dreams even if its destruction at the end.",1486512000,,2176,4.7026315789473685

5529248,4,B00AZI9JP4,"I thought the movie was pretty good, and it shipped well as it was undamaged. I don't like how it leaves you questioning the relationship between the two main characters. It is resolved...with a sort of deus ex machina.

It was a good movie, though be warned that things get...weird with the relationship. It's not actually what the characters fear, but it was something that bothered me greatly before I found out that it wasn't the case.",1474156800,,439,4.701298701298701

5529260,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Another Ghibli success! I love Japanese anime, and Ghibli makes real art. This particular film is a coming of age film worth seeing. Some may say it is too adult and the subject material inapropriate, however, I argue that is what makes it a much needed and timely film. We live in an age where people are testing and breaking free of traditions and taboos, and this movie brings to light one that is still taboo, and while it isn't broken, one is left wondering whether even this particular traditional taboo is worth keeping. Probably, I still find it icky. But as a gay man who lives in the bible belt, I've had my fair share of taboo testing, and I felt that, even though there are no queers featured in the film, I could relate to the characters because their relationship could have been non-normative.",1467072000,,808,4.541095890410959
5529261,3,B00AZI9JP4,"This movie didn't have any magical or fantasy plot to it, it was all real-life, don't get me wrong I think it's nice to watch something that is more realistic. But the truth is, the reason why I watch Ghibli studios movies is because it's all magical & fantasy-like (Spirited Away, Howl's moving castle, Kiki's delivery service, Totorro etc...) This had a feel of the old days and how it really digs into your soul for some kind of emotional reaction and yes a little bit of a tear jerker (but not a niagara falls). Like all Miyazaki movies I like looking at the details and the background, the art, the color and most especially the way the characters grows within the movie. There's a twist to this movie so if you must know, you have to watch it! I don't know any other place that sells this cheaper than here in Amazon, so if you're looking to purchase this would be it. The quality of Blu-ray is always best and you get a bonus dvd so what's more to ask for? One for you, the other one for your favorite relative (if you wanted to give the dvd version away). Overall the service of receiving this was quick, the item itself was in great condition and maybe if I decide to keep my prime account, I'll look for more Miyazaki movies in the future.",1466208000,4,1249,4.319148936170213

It is great that Studio Ghibli still does 2D animation, which a lot of movie studios are now moving away from.  The movie is set in Japan and the story line of this movie is very good.  It was a joy to watch this movie.  The Blu-Ray quality is great and the artwork is very well done. This isn't a Hayao Miyazaki movie, but it is still an awesome movie.  Studio Ghibli makes great movies and this movie definitely lives up to the high quality that is produced by this movie studio.

5529282,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This is a wonderful movie about Yokohama in 1962.  I happened to graduate highschool that year, and I also lived on a hill called Yamate.  In this movie, that hill is calledPoppie Hill.  If you look carefully, you can see a church on the hill.  This is the Sacred Heart Cathedral.  Back in 1962 the roads were not as nice as they are now.  There is an extra video after the movie, showing Yokohama then and now.  The Yokohama now looks quite different from what it looked like in 1962.  I looked carefully at this extra video, and can hardly recognize the place now.",1449100800,,566,4.375
5529283,3,B00AZI9JP4,"Taking place in 1963 in Yokohama, Japan, Umi (Sarah Bolger) is a high school student living in a boarding house with her grandmother while her mother is studying abroad. Every day Umi raises flags outside the hillside house and notices one day that someone has written a poem about them in her school newspaper. She meets Shun (Anton Yelchin) who works on the school newspaper for more information. Shun is working to save the dilapidated Latin Quarter building, that houses the school's clubs, because it is currently slated for demolition.

Overall, this was an average-at-best movie. To be sure, this film has Ghibli's trademark excellence in animation with many interesting and detailed backgrounds that bring to life 1960s Japan. I also thought that the music used was pretty good.

But what I did not like about this movie was the story. The plot line dealing with saving the Latin Quarter comes off as rather uninteresting and boring. Plus, the romance between Umi and Shun takes a really bizarre and contrived twist halfway through the movie, but by the ending I was left with a feeling of wondering why it was necessary at all.

You get plenty of bonus features with this set. There are storyboards and some behind-the-scenes features.

All in all, I felt this was only okay by Ghibli standards. Surely it is a must-see at some point for dedicated Ghibli fans, but the more casual moviegoer can probably skip it.",1448064000,6,1421,4.859504132231405

5529321,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This movie for me is how I wish all teenage romances were...Simple but with substance and absolutely beautiful.  Now first off I HIGHLY recommend you watch this in subtitles. The English dub is one of the worst of the Ghibli films I've  seen (next to Castle in the Sky).  Not necessarily for the voice acting but because of the ""Americanization"" of it.  Umi is A LOT more snarky in the American version, which normally I would prefer but she loses a sweetness to her that added to the spirit of the film.  Overall I think the dub was trying to make this movie funnier by adding snarky comments in random places. ""Wow these guys really like signs"" or ""Oh look it's an X chromosome.""  And while this could have worked for something else the beauty of the film is diminished by this and I couldn't help but wince especially when considering the time period and location.  Other than this dub malfunction  the film is sweet and a favorite among my Ghibli collection with beautiful landscapes and a slice of life story line that I wouldn't mind seeing more of.",1434240000,,1055,4.544973544973545

5529325,5,B00AZI9JP4,"A wonderful story with beautiful animation and a great soundtrack. Goro has come a long way from ""Tales from Earthsea"" (which I like but it had a lot of problems). Maybe I'm biased because I like seeing people redo/clean up things and make them like new and that's a centerpiece of the story, so ""I"" like it a lot. The characters are also pretty fun.

I only had a few problems. You can only view the extras on the blu-ray disc. The only extra on the DVD is the version of the film using the storyboards. The second problem is, as usual, the subtitles. I usually prefer to watch Ghibli films dubbed because they do a great job but this one I prefer subbed. They add an opening narration to the dub which explains what's going on but it's kind of silly sounding. The subs are fine for the most part and they translate signs, which is nice. But there are a few simple phrases where I know the sub is wrong. I know it's someone who knows Japanese better than I do and they're probably drawing on contextual clues but it's a bit disconcerting to hear someone say ""thank you"" while the sub says ""I'm so hungry!"" Stuff like that. I also don't know why the film is advertised with Shun at the forefront, nearly blocking Umi from view. The story is largely Umi's story. It actually makes a point of beginning and ending with her, alone. Yeah, the bicycle scene is cute but would it be that hard to have a box cover/poster showing Umi in the forefront? They could use the balcony scene, with Umi looking towards the ocean and Shun looking at her. Is it that difficult to have a woman in the forefront of her own story? It would make a lot more sense, given the title, since from the box cover we have no idea what ""poppy hill"" is being referenced by two kids in a city on a bicycle.",1430265600,2,1773,4.276785714285714

5529329,5,B00AZI9JP4,"From Up on Poppy Hill is one of the most delightful films Ive ever seen.  Let me be clear  that includes live action, not just animated fare.  Director Goro Miyazaki, son of Hayao, directs with a deft hand.  The script by his father, perhaps the greatest living animator, hits all the right notes with characters who transcend time and place.  This film is a joy from start to finish.

The story revolves around Umi Matsuzaki, a teenager in Yokohama in 1963.  Her life is complicated but fulfilling.  She spends most of her time either at school or tending to the boarders who occupy her familys home.  Neither parent is present when the film begins, but theres a network of relatives which includes a benevolent grandmother who lives in the house too.  The place is a hive of activity and Umi is lucky to have five minutes to herself each morning to do one thing for herself.  She raises a series of signal flags up a flagpole thats within view of the harbor.

Her intense but consistent routine is broken when Umi suddenly finds herself with a crush on fellow student, Shun Kazama.  Shun produces the school paper and has written a brief poem about the girl who raises the flags, a reference Umis friends insist must reference her.  The two flirt a bit before unforeseen elements get in the way of their courtship.

To tell you more than that would do you a great disservice.  Suffice it to say there is a great deal more to the plot but half the pleasure is letting it unfold before you.  The story is important in that it gives the viewer a reason to stay in the world of the film, but it was the charm of the characters and their world that touched me.

These days almost every film consists of characters trying to screw one another over in order to get the money or drugs or property or girl or something.  Theres only one American filmmaker whose films consistently defy this convention and thats Wes Anderson.  If any of his characters want to deceive the others, its usually in a wrongheaded pursuit of love and belonging.  I don't think any of Andersons characters are inherently evil.  This films script goes one step further and shows us a world wherein everyone is doing their best to help the other members of their group.  Its a very Japanese ideal and one thats downright refreshing to see represented so lucidly here.  None of these characters behaves selfishly.  That fact gives us a glimpse at a sort of Utopian way of life.  Thats not to say there aren't conflicts and pitfalls in the story  there are, but they spring from the differences between people instead of their need to beat someone else to the prize.

Japanese animators have really stepped up their game in recent years.  There was a time when a picture that looked as good as this one does would be singled out for high praise.  The animation here is detailed and beautiful but it isn't up to the standard of a major release as directed by Hayao Miyazaki these days.  This is sort of a B picture from Studio Ghibli, like The Secret World of Arrietty a short while back.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I was not a fan of Ponyo despite the fact that it got the big budget treatment.  At the end of the day, the story is everything.

This production was particularly troubled due to the fact that it took place during one of the worst natural (and unnatural) disasters in Japans historythe Tohoku earthquake and tsunami which was followed by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.  At one point, it was assumed that the film would not be finished at all.  Fortunately for us, the Ghibli staff would not give up and they worked around the power outages to present us with this gem.  Their generous spirit inhabits every frame of the film.

The work of Goro Miyazaki on this project should not be underestimated.  Yes, the design and story are both clearly from his father, but he guided this production with the sensitivity and grace of a far more seasoned director.  He may not yet have the same long history of animated work to pull from as his father, but with any luck well be seeing masterpieces from him for many years to come.  I hope he continues to develop his own, unique artistic vision.

The sound and music in this production are both spectacular.  I watched the movie with the Japanese dialogue and subtitles and found the Japanese actors to be amazing.  I expect the English celebrity cast will be top notch even though I always prefer the original Japanese cast.  Its interesting to note that the US release of this picture doesnt appear to have had any involvement from Disney.  While thats all well and good, it worries me that Disney may be backing away from their commitment to Pixars John Lasseter to present Hayao Miyazakis films in relatively high-profile releases stateside.

I hope you will have the time and wherewithal to see this fine film.  I could not recommend it more highly.",1428883200,,4895,4.577675489067894

5529346,5,B00AZI9JP4,"""From Up on Poppy Hill"" is set in the early 1960s, and while the English dub makes this plain in an expository opening monologue, in the original Japanese version our initial cues are far subtler: background newspaper headlines and a nostalgic soundtrack of postwar jazz and pop hits. (This is one of the more egregious examples of how English-language Ghibli adaptations change the tone of the studio's works; use subtitles when possible.) In the original it becomes clear only slowly that the period setting is not merely a romantic conceit, although the story is indeed romantic to the point of occasional melodrama. The early 1960s was a significant time for Japan, and an appreciation of the deeper meanings of ""Poppy Hill"" requires some understanding of the context. Happily, the movie itself provides this context brilliantly. The Tokyo Olympics of 1964 are on the horizon, and this landmark event in Japan's economic boom and global reorientation looms over all. Much of the urban scenery depicted in the movie is under construction, and an agitated group of students observes that Japan is ""building a new society on the ruins of the old."" The old society, of course, was a casualty of the war, and the war and its ripple effects were the occasion of great personal loss for the film's main characters, a boy and a girl in a Yokohama high school. Born at the breaking point that separated the old Japan from the new, their only links to the past are the old photographs they each reverently guard. They each have a deep longing to connect with the past: their personal pasts represented by the people they have lost, and also the physical past of their surroundings that is increasingly threatened by runaway development. These themes, and the focus on the war's irreparable human costs, fit perfectly in the Ghibli canon, since many of Miyazaki's films are concerned with nostalgia, cultural identity, and environmental protection. But ""Poppy Hill"" is distinctive in its presentation, which is far more historically-grounded and intensely personal than most of its predecessors. Japan's tumultuous history shapes the lead characters' arcs in dramatic and unanticipated ways, but in the service of symbolism there is some sacrifice of depth in their personalities. They are perhaps too much the ideal anime boy and ideal anime girl, hard-working and chipper to a fault, unlike the occasionally self-interested star of ""Spirited Away"" or the deeply uncertain adolescent title character of ""Kiki's Delivery Service.""

5529350,5,B00AZI9JP4,"In 1963 Japan, the country is still trying to find its identity in the wake of a less-than-glorious war.  The push to move into a better, brighter future, to find a new beginning, is prominent as the nation rebuilds, and the upcoming hosting of the next Olympic Games is seen as an opportunity to present a new Japan to the world.  But, in turning over a new leaf and healing old wounds, how much of the past being swept away is too much?  This question is raised as, in Yokohama, much of the old city is being torn down and demolished to make room for the new Olympic venues.  The students at one of the local high schools, scheduled to be demolished in the near future, rally to save their school, and through this effort the viewer is brought into the daily lives of the students, teachers, and families of the area.  It may sound dull to some, but this is a Studio Ghibli movie, and though they do make tremendous fantasy/adventure films, they also excel at finding the magic and the marvellous in the everyday.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisper-of-the-Heart-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B007JNTPSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisper of the Heart (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;is a great point of comparison.

Two of the students, Shun and Umi, end up working on the same save-the-school project, and romance quickly blooms between them.  As happens a lot with romantic pairings, an obstacle soon shows up to put itself between them.  Many times, the thing or circumstance keeping the two leads from being together is something where you're going, ""They're letting THAT keep them apart?"".  Things that shouldn't be such a big deal.  However, in Up On Poppy Hill, the obstacle (and it came out of left field, I didn't see this one coming) is something big, something that truly appears insurmountable no matter the protagonists' feelings for one another.

And then we're left with the question of whether there's any possible way for things to work out for Umi and Shun, or if From Up On Poppy Hill is left as a great movie but with one of the saddest endings around.  I don't want to hint which way it goes, I'll just say the whole movie is handled brilliantly and the characterizations and voice performances are first rate.

On the matter of trying to save the school and other landmarks from being torn down for the new buildings, the conflict in the movie actually isn't 'new vs. old' or 'tradition vs. progress'.  It's a question of does there have to be a 'versus' at all?  Can both sides find a way to integrate and co-exist in the world, or does there automatically Have to be a loser in order for its 'opposite' to thrive?

5529391,5,B00AZI9JP4,"A great movie from Ghibli. As others have said, it lacks the fantasy elements of Totoro or Spirited Away... and yet without the fantastic parts, it's as if the slice of life in Japan is even closer and more connected to me as a non-Japanese person. It's more approachable, the gentle coming of age story, because there's no weird Japanese fantasy monsters jumping off of the screen. The characters are left to struggle through their emotions and their histories on their own, or with the humble help of other regular people. It might not thrill the animators and manga fanatics, but I love that this movie has no giant kaiju creatures running amok.

As much as my kids enjoy Totoro or Ponyo or others from Ghibli, this is the movie they keep coming back to. And movies like Frozen or Tangled are long since relegated to the ""Ewww, Dad"" pile. Disney & Pixar just don't have the staying power of Ghibli. Even for us adults, there's an undeniable beauty in the way the story unfolds, and leaves you to imagine at the end without wrapping it neatly into a bow.

There's something in this flick that speaks more to the people my kids would like to know more about, and I think that's great.",1413417600,2,1185,4.5327102803738315

5529396,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Now this is what I hope for from Ghibli.  Every bit as good as Spirited Away or Ponyo, but even maybe a bit more emotional impact, almost as much as Grave of the Fireflies (though not in a negative way like that one was, this one is more uplifting).  This is a tremendously rewarding and moving story of love, loss, and hope, but also childhood joy and camaraderie.  Don't worry that it takes place during Japan's Reconstruction and looks at those times through a lens of wistful remembrance, even though you may not be Japanese or remember those things yourself.  Most young Japanese don't remember those times either, and they enjoyed it ;)  Seriously though, things are presented in such a way as I would doubt any viewer would feel uncomfortable and, if you do pay attention to the details, you will leave this with a tremendous and intimate understanding of not only the way people lived during the Reconstruction, but what their hopes, joys, fears, and losses were about (another parallel to Grave of the Fireflies).",1412035200,12,1022,4.751412429378531

5529432,3,B00AZI9JP4,"While I love this movie (the missing stars are for the product, not the film), I am someone who prefers to watch the movie in Original Japanese with subtitles. Sadly, though the Blu-ray makes it appear you can select the option of original cast subtitles, the only one that works is the English cast. There's no point in watching it in Japanese if I am getting the English adaptation subtitles instead of the English translation. I was extremely disappointed in the Blu-ray, especially for making it seem like the original translation was an option. The English dub did a good job, but it's not the same. If anyone shares my preference, I would advise finding another way to watch it.

Edit: it works on the plain DVD version. So it's not worth buying the combo pack if this is what you want.",1404518400,,792,4.577464788732394

5529434,5,B00AZI9JP4,"A beautiful and gentle story.  Basically a slice-of-life kind of story (which I have a particular love for), that really brings the viewer in for an absorbing trip into another world.  Awesome!  It's a great story just like the ones that came before like ""Whisper of the heart"". Beautiful backgrounds and artwork throughout.  If you're not moved by a movie like this than you're not human,  or you just like something else.  Who am I to judge...",1404259200,,445,4.714285714285714
5529435,4,B00AZI9JP4,"Last impression is perhaps best with the ending theme song, ""Summer of Farewells"", which IMO should have been used throughout the story as a motif or whatever it's called, I've rarely seen it done well, when it is done, and this story would've been perfect for that use. That said. I like the story, which is a character piece more than any other Ghibli anime I've seen. I agree with some of the critics that it needs a plot driver... to drive or push the story along with more of a goal or purpose, and it ended a little too abruptly IMO. I agree with those that say to watch the original Japanese cast with the english dubs... not sure why, but there are a couple of times that, in key moments, what is said is different than the english cast and it is a WTF?! reaction, not that it really changes anything, but it's different than the original, which let's face it, is better because the feel of the anime is Japanese, so obviously the Japanese cast relates the feel of the characters in their voices, sometimes in silence, which seems to be feared here in the States and like a radio host, any silent moment must be filled, even if with nonsense. I would recommend English peaking viewers watch the English cast then the next day watch the original Japanese cast with the English dubs, that way you know the characters and storyline and can better appreciate the original, which like in any anime, is better in the language the characters are visually expressed in... it does make a difference, whether or not you understand any of the history etc... though I would recommend watching the interviews first as well to get a little bit of a feel for the background... though that IMO should have been inserted into the background with a little dialogue etc.. it really doesn't take much, a few words here or there, as I would think even a modern Japanese viewer might not have a feel for this time from after the war to the Olympics, which could have been used as a background for the society's transition better. Overall, it's a good story, love that ending theme song, very atmospheric but with a story behind it unlike many such songs by Enya, as the words give it a destination and a better feel.
  A line by the surviving captain about the similarity of two old friends in looks would have settled another issue that's used in the story's plotting... as they did look like brothers if not twins in that photo. The story just needs a little tweeking to bring it up to the par of many other Ghibli products. Listening just now to a collection of Ghibli theme songs, and this one from Poppy Hill sounds like the beginning of Castle in the Sky. Perhaps the same composer?
  Poppy Hill just needs a little more of a plot driver and a finishing scene that shows the characters in their change with the nation's changing scene in the background for context and depth. Nice story setup otherwise.",1404259200,,2895,4.508571428571429

5529473,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Although ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" was not directed by renowned Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki (it was his son, Goro Miyazaki), he was responsible for the storyboards and screenplay, and as my nine-year-old daughter and I (both great Miyazaki fans) watched this yesterday, we could not help comparing this to ""Whisper of the Heart"" with its theme of teen angst and searching for one's identity. There's so much to appreciate here in terms of animation and storytelling.

The story is set in Yokohama in 1963. Japan, after the devastation of WW II is preparing to host the Olympics. High schooler Umi lives with her grandmother who runs a boarding house. Umi's mom is in the US pursuing her studies, and Umi is depicted as a hardworking and dutiful daughter and granddaughter, going about her chores and attending to her studies. Umi misses her father, a naval officer whose supply ship sank during WW II. Every day, she puts up the flags to see if there will be some kind of response (the flags send messages). Unbeknown to Umi, another high schooler Shun, has noticed the flags and has even written a poem about it. This sets the stage for a meeting between the two and a friendship blossoms which turns into love. However, there is a family secret that might tear the two apart. The rest of the story deals with how Shun and Umi learn to come to terms with their circumstances.

Having watched ""Whisper of the Heart"", I feel there are quite a few similarities here. Shun has a gift for writing, and in ""Whisper of the Heart"", the female character loves to compose song lyrics and also write. Through their writing, both characters are shown to evolve and get a sense of self-identity. In both stories, the young couples face challenges that they must overcome in order to strengthen their ties with each other. I think these stories with their themes of teen angst, alienation, and self-actualization, will appeal to mature tweens and young adults alike.

The DVD set by Studio Ghibli comes with 2 DVDs: the first features the animated feature and the second contains bonus features that include the original Japanese version, feature length storyboards, celebrity cast recording featurette, interview with director Goro Miyazaki, music video, Yokohama featurette, and the original Japanese trailers and TV spots.",1395446400,2,2315,4.915601023017903
5529474,4,B00AZI9JP4,"This film is from Studio Ghibli but it is not of the quality you come to expect from them. It was not made by Hayao Miyasaki and Joe Hishaishi did not do the film score. It was a cute story though and the graphics were beautiful. I liked it. I'm just not in love with it like I am My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Monanoke or Howl's Moving Castle.

It's one of those films where at the end you say ""wow what a journey."" Miyazaki films have always been one of two things, a fantasy like epic or a down to earth everyday kind of drama story. This film is the latter.  The character development was done well and made you want to cheer on the characters.

This is a great I don't know what I want to watch movie. It's got the Ghibli feel and the animation is fantastic. Also watching the review by Hayao (part of the extra's) is kind of funny because it gives you insight on how big of a perfectionist Hayao really was and how much this industry will miss him.

5529489,4,B00AZI9JP4,"I was very unimpressed with the storyline after I watched this for the first time.  Fortunately, the second viewing was MUCH more rewarding.  Set in Japan after the 1964 Olympics (hard to believe that was 50 years ago),the film is about so much more than a budding romance.  As a group of students try to save an old frat house called 'The Latin Quarter' from destruction, the storylines weave together seamlessly at a relaxed pace that stresses development of the main characters, Umi and Shun.
Along with the story, the film has a lot to say about the importance of history in culture.  There is a tension in the film surrounding the progress and renovation brought about by the Olympics, and the value of keeping our past alive, symbolized by the Latin Quarter.

One other thing that stood out in my mind was how enjoyable the soundtrack was, really lending a nostalgic feel to the film.  In some cases, the music was more reminiscent of a time prior to 1964, but it served the film well nonetheless.  And, as has come to be expected from Studio Ghibli, the animation is absolutely breathtaking.  With the upcoming release of 'The Wind Rises' being supposedly Hayao Miyazaki's last feature film, one can only hope that his son Goro (who directed this film) will continue to make anime movies worthy of the Miyazaki name.

The press conference with Hayao Miyazaki, both revealing and emotional, and the staff screening segment a very neat glimpse into a moment of life at Studio Ghibli. The dubbing featurette was wonderful as well, and the storyboards view of the entire film is a great look behind the scenes of the animation process.

Although From Up on Poppy Hill doesn't contain any type of supernatural aspect which Hayao Miyazaki is famous for incorporating into most of the stories he writes, I find that the nature of the characters and the charm of the story reminds me of his film Kiki's Delivery Service (which is among my favorites).

Not to mention, the time. The time frame is a little out of the usually for Miyazaki's films as well.... though the only thing consistent with his work is the quality. He never seems to do the same thing twice.

5529506,4,B00AZI9JP4,"This is a great film -- it reminds me the most of ""Whisper of the Heart"" with the pacing and the atmosphere.  If you are a Ghibli fan, this is a no brainer: go watch this film.  Since it was directed by Hayao's son, Goro, I was a little worried that this would be another flop (see: Tales From Earthsea), but its a very charming film and still has the ""Miyazaki"" spirit.

The English voice acting, as with most other Ghibli films, is spot-on.  This time, the cast isn't as distracting as other Ghibli works, which works to its benefit.  Sometimes the ""Disney""-released movies get a little distracting with their ""all star"" cast of voice actors, but this one has voices that really blend well with the movie.

The only issue I have with the film is that with this casual, meandering tale, it's hard to pinpoint a central meaning to it.  It's definitely more of a ""slice of life"" film than narrative-driven.  Additionally, the ending was very abrupt.  This didn't detract too much from the film itself, but it was noticeable. If you've seen ""Pom Poko"" -- it's similar in that way.

Some of the extras are refreshing, too.  It was interesting to see that, at the screening, Hayao was a little harsh on the team, yet at the same time encouraging.  It reminds me a bit of Steve Jobs's management style.  Goro was very apologetic to the team (even though the final product was very good).  It was very interesting to see the dynamic between all of them.  It shows how seriously they take building a film like this, and how they scrutinize and agonize over every detail.  They also briefly touch on the earthquake (which interrupted development of the film for a time).  It must have been a massive amount of pressure, even without the other issues.  It shows a little bit into how Ghibli becomes ""Ghibli"" and how dedicate they all are.

Although it feels a little rough and unfinished in parts, the Ghibli spirit shines through.  I feel like this is a good sign for Goro Miyazaki taking the reins of the Ghibli Studio and I look forward to his future endeavors.",1391644800,,2055,4.547683923705722

From Up On Poppy Hill is unabashed eye candy. Others in the house really enjoyed the main musical theme. I found the music to be pleasant enough but not at Joe Hisaishi's routinely EXCELLENT standard.

Goro Miyazaki, I think, has it in him to surpass his father in epic storytelling. This film is a slice of life young love story with a small but important twist. Will I keep it in the collection? Yes. Will I watch it again as I will with other films from Studio Ghibli? Likely not.",1391558400,,706,4.595238095238095

Lastly, and very much true to Ghibli, the scenery is immensely rich, detailed, and as much a part of the story as any of the characters.",1391472000,,430,4.455696202531645

More seriously:
It's really a simple day in the life of some people movie. I suppose much like Totoro before it but minus the magic and more on the interactions of a group of people with two being more prominent then the others. It's just so pleasant and endearing that you slowly fade out the desire to predict what the main climactic portion of the movie will be about. Which it pretty much doesn't have one but you don't care....and you don't know why you don't but you just....aw man. There's some romance, cold shouldering, perseverance, rising above it to soldier on, fighting for what keeps you grounded and a conclusion. It's just a take it slow, relaxing and warm movie.

5529514,5,B00AZI9JP4,"You can always count on Studio Ghibli to provide and imaginative animated film loaded with heart. This time Haiyo Miyazaki's son Goro takes the directors chair for the second time to bring us 'From Up On Poppy Hill'. You could probably think of it as a long lost follow up to 'Grave of the Fireflies'. While that film took place during World War 2, 'From Up On Poppy Hill' takes place in the early 1960's the time when Japan had finally been set free from American occupation and was taking its first steps towards being the powerful democracy it is today.

The film takes place when Japan is about to host it's first of many Olympic games and to do so the city of Tokyo has to tear up a piece of its past to make way for the future. However that may not be so easy as almost an entire high school does not want to let go of a historical landmark they have been using as their after school club house. It is also the way that two young people discover a deep love for one another and uncover a few links to their own pasts as well. Some of which can shake the very fabric of their friendship.

'From Up Poppy Hill' is not one of those epic films, but it makes you feel good and young again. It is one that I have already watched multiple times and as it could be one of the few that gets over looked, one you see it, you will love it.",1390521600,,1334,4.087786259541985

Well, I get that feeling about pretty much anything that Studio Ghibli releases, since I've been an avid fan of their works for a long time now. Anyway, this movie is a very well done coming of age, slice of life story that may make you think ""oh, that happened to me"" more than once throughout the movie. As usual, the animation quality is top notch. No one rivals Studio Ghibli when it comes to hand drawn animation. They are number one, hands down. Also, the music is great and goes well with the setting and theme of the story. The character designs are really good, too. All of these are to be expected from Studio Ghibli. That's why they are so critically acclaimed throughout the world as masters of animation. Anyway, the story is a simple yet heartwarming one about growing up and love. We all experience both of these, so it hits close to home and draws you in even deeper. Sometimes, the simple things in life are the ones that create the fondest memories.

5529517,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This is a beautiful movie. So beautiful, that by the end you may wish you had lived in Yokohama in 1963, up on Poppy Hill. Maybe even being a guest at Umi's grandma's house.

The story itself is a straightforward teen romance between the main protagonist, Umi, and the lad Shun.
However, there are many other elements which draw the viewer in. One, of course, is the physical setting of Poppy Hill. It truly looks magnificent - an unspoilt, undeveloped neighborhood of old Japanese homes set high on Poppy Hill with views to the sea. Even Umi's route to school looks spectacular as she crosses the bridge over the tram tracks, while the background scenes of the markets, the busy main streets, and docks are full of detail to dazzle the eyes. A nice touch is a Coke sign on a small advertising hoarding amidst the mass of Kanji characters.  Then there is Umi's bicycle ride down the hill to the markets - an inspired whip through the neighborhood - set to Kyu Sakamoto's classic hit ""Sukiyaki"" from that period. That's definitely a scene that merits multiple viewings. (What remains of the old sections of Yokohama today? Judging by one of the extras on the Blu-ray disc, I'd guess, sadly, not much at all.)

Apart from beautiful settings, this movie has HEART. No villains. No ""funny"" sidekicks. No slapstick. No super heroes. No whiny kids. No simplistic caricatures. No magical hoopla. In the notes, Miyazaki reflects on the mood of optimism in Japan circa 1963, as the Korean war had ended, the economy was firing up, and preparations were in full swing for the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Accordingly, while Umi may have lost her father in the Korean War, and her mother may be working/studying in the US, that's not enough to stop this girl. She is rock solid. Look after  little brother and sister? Check! Feed the lodgers, and balance the budget? No worries! Naturally grandma is proud of her, though she does wonder when Umi will get over the loss of her father. Which brings us to the raising of the signal flags....and Shun.

The whole family ended up watching the thing together on a Saturday night and that in itself testifies to the films ability to engage an audience of varied ages 13, 16, 18 and us old folks.

5529520,4,B00AZI9JP4,"The English-dubbed soundtrack plays flawlessly, but the original Japanese one has a problem: parts of it can be inaudible except, perhaps, with a top-of-the-line sound system.
I watched with my PC hooked-up to a large-screen monitor with a simple stereo two-channel audio output. Parts of the soundtrack were clearly missing: a voice-over at the very beginning, and a song after the end titles; who knows what else, as well. I could tell, because the words appeared in the English sub-titles, but there was no sound. I have never encountered this sort of problem before, even though I have a fairly large collection of movies and TV shows.

Now, my take on the movie:
It is meant for older teens and adults; it will be probably boring for children.
A film mostly about the details and patterns of daily life, thoughtfully and carefully shown in a mostly plain, but now and then gorgeous, animation style. Unlike the most famous movies from the Ghibli study, there are no magical characters. The characters are engaging enough, and the main plot is good enough to keep things moving. But, at least for me, it is the details that have magic.
The place and time is Japan in the early sixties, but most of the domestic scenes - some cultural details aside -- resemble more family life in the West back in the fifties, because Japan was still catching up, after the devastation of the war.
As someone who was a young man in the fifties, even in a different culture, I find that such ordinary things as turning on the gas to heat water first thing in the morning, do really take me back. And most of the street and high school scenes are full of people, each one doing something recognizable and interesting, even when glimpsed at for just a second.
A previous Ghibli movie, in some ways similar, ""Whisper of the Heart"", shows contemporary Tokyo in a way that is both realistic and engaging. ""Poppy Hill"" shows the place at a moment of transition to its present form, still with much of the old Japan that is no longer there, and much that is still recognizable in the present day metropolis. For me Tokyo is a dear city, and the way it is shown gives this movie an added attractive.
As many other Ghibli movies, this one is mostly about a serious, smart, thoughtful, self-possessed, and determined young lady, here seen at her turning point from girl into woman.
The film has been characterized by some, including the late Roger Ebert, as bland, slow, even boring. In my opinion, it is not so much slow as unhurried, and watching it can be a good, refreshing experience - when approached in the proper spirit. It is the right movie for those that like to see, now and then, something worth watching just for what is shown: for every perfect vignette of daily life, however small and trivial, because they are satisfying enough already, so a highly dramatic, action-filled plot is not needed. (If looking for something well done, but dark, gritty and disturbing, one can always watch ""Breaking Bad""; give this one a chance.)",1389398400,6,3018,4.68361581920904

5529542,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Studio Ghibli more than delivers with this film. I admit that I wasn't too excited for it at first as I usually prefer fantasy movies, but every minute of it was an absolute joy to watch.

The setting is Yokohama, Japan, 1963. High school students Umi Matsuzaki and Shun Kazama, along with many of their classmates, are in a struggle to protect their clubhouse from demolition in favor of a new one. This rather small issue reflects bigger changes all over the country as people strive to move into the future and leave the past behind. The movie is full of humorous moments as well as the serious ones as it presents both the good and painful effects of the past on the present.

The soundtrack is one of my favorite aspects of the movie, as it includes not only soft, beautiful pieces, but also ones with the Jazzy style of the time-period. The animation is wonderful just to look at, and the sound effects really create the atmosphere perfectly. I watched the movie in Japanese with subtitles the first few times, but when I watched it in English I was very pleased. The sound was mixed so well. Sometimes I think the voices in anime dubs are a bit too loud, but the English language actors' voices blended in so well with the other sounds. Also, the acting was very well done. Sarah Bolger as Umi had the perfect amount of energy while still sounding reserved. Anton Yelchin as Shun did surprise me, his voice being very different from that of the Japanese actor, but overall I think he had a good understanding of the character.

I bought numerous blu-rays during the black friday and cyber monday sales and have since discovered that at least four of them (including this one) are used discs being sold as new. All of the discs were sold and shipped by Amazon. Most of them were bought through lightning deals. This happened to me earlier in the year as well. At that time, I exchanged the movie for a new one to resolve.

My guess is Amazon is getting these ""new"" products from their trade-in program. Pay pennies --> resell at normal or close to normal price --> make money hand over fist.

I'll be initiating an exchange for this movie, but if I get another used disc back, I'll be straight up returning this and the other discs in question.

Hopefully the below help others spot if they're getting cheated with used products when they're expecting something new. Your disc is likely used if:
- the case is in that stretchy shrink-wrap that's melted along the edges rather than the crisp cellophane that's folded at the top and bottom of the case (note that sometimes the stretchy stuff is actually the legit and new shrink-wrap).
- any of the corners of the case are cracked
- you can see scoffs along the case, through the shrink-wrap
- there are bits of the original cellophane still stuck to the case, under the new shrink-wrap (this one's always a fun one)
- the paper wraparound cover is damaged
- upon opening, the inserts are damaged or missing
- the disc(s) have fingerprints on them (yes, this one is extra obvious)

5529553,5,B00AZI9JP4,"From Up on Poppy Hill is not the kind of film anyone familiar with the names Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki might come to expect from the Oscar-winning and blockbuster studio and director.

But while this film written by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa and directed by Hayaos son Goro Miyazaki may be the opposite of the more fantastical films they are known for, it isn't any less beautifully animated nor less emotionally affecting.

From Up on Poppy Hill tells the story of Umi Matsuzaki, a 16-year old high school student in 1963 Yokohama. While taking care of her familys boarding house and its residents in the mornings and evenings, she takes an interest in helping fellow student Shun Kazama work to save her schools dilapidated clubhouse from demolition.

Working together soon draws them closer to each other until a surprising past is revealed that momentarily puts a stop to the feelings they have developed for each other.

And while that little tidbit sounds very soapy, especially for an animated film from Studio Ghibli, it is only one small part of the greater narrative.

And that narrative is one that evokes a dream-like nostalgia very much present in the previous works of Miyazaki, the senior. The signature hand-drawn animation beautifully brings to life a more idyllic, yet at the same time tensely transitional period in Japans history.

Serving as a window to the country and its people after World War II and the Korean War and before the successful 1964 Tokyo Olympics, From Up on Poppy Hill is a nostalgic and warm slice of life drama. It paints the picture of a bustling, but hometown feeling port city during a much simpler time, making it relatable to people of any culture or ethnicity. Specifically, it touches on the quickly developing country, eager to recover from the painful decades before.

Thinking of Studio Ghibli and the master that is Hayao Miyazaki, one immediately thinks of such fantastical films as Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro or fiercely thought provoking films like Princess Mononoke and pre-Ghibli Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And while it shares many of the same qualities, From Up on Poppy Hill is a much simpler story.

But it is in its simplicity that From Up on Poppy Hill draws its best, unique qualities. It is at times a heartwarming story of friendship and young love and at others, a fun look at childhood and youth. The film subtly, but effectively conveys that poignant nostalgia that can make even a 26-year old youngin like me can get teary eyed at the thought of a much simpler time.

The film takes care to point out how important the past is in our present and future. For the characters, it is their holding on to their pasts that help get them through to their futures. Thats a philosophy I personally subscribe to as well, making it that much more meaningful to me.

So yes, the film does have plenty of MaGMCMs, including right at the end when everything just sinks in. And that may just be a trademark of a Hayao Miyazki written screenplay.

While the younger Miyazaki, Goro, drew a tepid response to his directorial debut, the uneven Tales from Earthsea, he recovers very well here and shows that he does have a promising future following in his fathers very big footsteps.

From Up on Poppy Hill may not have the grand, fantastical adventure of other Studio Ghibli films, but it is just as engaging and contains just as much magic thanks to its beautifully breathtaking visuals, likeable characters and sincerely nostalgic story.",1386460800,2,3514,4.799668874172186

The case and slipcase both look fine, and the ""booklet"" inside of the case is much better than I would have expected.  I haven't tried playing the DVD yet, but the Blu-ray Disc looks fantastic.  The image does jump around ever so slightly, but it's hard to notice as the movie goes on and you continue to be absorbed into the world it portrays.",1386288000,3,523,4.416666666666667
5529555,1,B00AZI9JP4,"I haven't been this disappointed in a Ghibli film before.  Not even Ponyo, which was terrible, had me this indifferent to it.  The animation is gorgeous, as you expect from Studio Ghibli, but it's just pretty wrapping around an empty box.  The film is utterly forgettable, a standard romance plot with boring characters and numerous subplots and conflicts that all get resolved with a hand wave.

For example, there was a conflict in the plot involving the two romantic leads potentially being brother and sister due to a convoluted back story, but that proves to be one of the film's major flaw.  The back story is so convoluted and hinges on so many coincidences that in the end, you're not sure you quite believe it in the end when a character never before introduced in the film suddenly comes out of nowhere to just *tell* the audience that, no, these two aren't related, so their romance is okay.

But even assuming you do buy what said character tells you, what ultimately makes this film fall apart is that it commits the cardinal sin of being boring and forgettable.  Immediately after finishing the film, I found I could not recall a single character's name, nor could I remember most of the events that filled it's running time.  My brain immediately decided that nothing in this film was really worth committing to long term storage and threw most of it out and I feel not inclination whatsoever to see it again.",1386201600,11,1424,4.690763052208835
5529556,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Myself and my wife are both enormous Ghibli fans, and both of us are of the firm opinion that From Up on Poppy Hill constitutes the best Studio Ghibli film bar none. Yes, the movie doesn't possess the heavy-handed, unrelenting grief and potent message of Grave of the Fireflies. And no, it isn't another Spirited Away (although that may be a good thing. Spirited Away is so utterly nonsensical that at times I think people are applying meaning where there is none).

What From Up on Poppy Hill is, though, is a beautiful love story, set in a Japan struggling to emerge from the clouds of war guilt and reenter the global stage. It's a Japan that we Americans neither know nor remember. While the United States spent the 1960s dealing with racism and the looming peril of nuclear war, Japan looked inwards, fighting to understand its place in the world. Who were the Japanese? What was their identity? What did the future hold for them?

Such are the questions that the film's protagonists Umi Matsuzaki and Shun Kazama must deal with themselves. At the movie's opening, Umi labors night and day in anonymity, striving to juggle school work and manage her Grandmother's boarding house; watching as her precious youth slips away. Shy but daring Shun secretly loves her from afar, answering her daily prayer to her deceased father with his own unseen proclamations of love, all the while knowing little of his own dead father's past. After Shun publishes a poetic reply to Umi's flags in the school paper, Umi finally discovers he exists, only to have the two of them rapidly tumble over a precipice into the greatest emotional strife of their young lives.

All this plays out as students at their school fight to save an old building -- a literal link to their own past -- from the heavy-handed, eradicative policies of the school board, who seek to remove all reminders of pre-War Japan. Umi and Shun's own fates become intrinsically linked to those of the building, as both discover that the foundations of their future lie buried within the past.

Those reviewers who have levied the complaints that the movie is 'slow,' or 'ponderous in developing' miss the entire point. Unlike Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, From Up on Poppy Hill is Ghibli's lightest and most emotionally-tender touch. And unlike the carefree nature of Kiki's Delivery Service, Poppy Hill's characters are rooted in a real world where the escapism of magic or imaginary creatures aren't available to solve their problems. They, like the rest of their nation, must fight through the trials of their time, to emerge all the more vibrant and stronger.

I watched it with two other fans, both of whom saw most of the other films with me, and we all had the same reaction:  Meh.  Then we were backpedaling and apologizing and excusing because well, something must be wrong with us if we weren't absolutely amazed, right?  It's Miyazaki, it has to be awesome.

Well, I'm afraid it was merely OK, at least for us.  On the plus side, the visuals are beautiful and the portrayal of daily life in his period drama is interesting and engaging.  I wish I could say the same for the plot and characters, however.  We thought the ""problem"" wasn't toothy enough to make for interesting drama, and the principal characters were so reserved it was difficult to really care deeply about their successes or failures.  It didn't have any of the magic of Ponyo or Spirited Away (literally as well as figuratively) and the music was wonky (intentionally, to fit 60's Japan, but i still didn't like it) rather than breathtaking.  Finally, the ending left too much unsaid for our taste, with one of us saying out loud ""wait, it's over?  Just like that?""

5529570,4,B00AZI9JP4,"Based on a serial graphic comic from the 1980s, ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" is a sweet and gentle Japanese anime drama set in 1963, right on the eve of that nation's hosting of the Tokyo Olympics.

Voiced by Sarah Bolger in the English version, Umi is a high school girl whose mother is studying in America and whose father has apparently died in the Korean War. She currently lives in a boarding house run by her grandmother where she cooks the meals for the residents and her two younger sisters. Umi also raises flags everyday in the hope that her father, whose body has never been found, will find his way to her. Umi has also fallen for a cute boy, the publisher of the school newspaper, and, through him, she becomes instrumental in helping to save a clubhouse the philosophy geeks use for their meetings and which has been threatened with demolition by the higher-ups who are more interested in modernizing war-ravaged Japan than in holding onto relics of the past.

Directed by Goro Miyazaki, ""Poppy Hill"" is an old-fashioned, no-fuss movie that deliberately avoids the CGI effects and hectic style of most modern animated movies. The use of cell-drawn animation yields an uncluttered palette that nicely matches the storyline. The characters' movements are fairly stiff and the facial expressions virtually nonexistent, but the background has a lovely watercolor appearance that captures the visual simplicity of an earlier era.

The screenplay by  Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa lacks focus at times, but that actually adds to the movie's charm since we don't feel as if we're watching an overly contrived narrative designed to make points. As such, it's a movie that youngsters in particular will find reflective of their own concerns and lives, regardless of nationality.",1384041600,,1778,4.956375838926174

5529594,4,B00AZI9JP4,"I won't deal in specifics because it would undermine the story's essence as well as it's plot.
This is a keeper. That's only thing that comes to mind when thinking about this sleeper drama that never made it into mainstream movie houses. Disney couldn't think of a way to promote an animated film from the house that Miyazaki built because there's nothing fantastic going on, at least not in the sense that the world is being saved and exotic creatures abound in the effort. This is a nice, well structure slice of life and coming of age tale with small but potent mystery at its heart. It's also a brave film, beautifully told with ample wit, lovable characters and emotional core that really delivers in the end. At times it's a little heart breaking but it's also ideally suited to the serious drama that's underlying the premise.
It deals with history and assumptions that arise from that history and how it affects the survivors when the details get lost. It also addresses change and it's constant flow forward, and how to hang on when those changes prove troubling.
I will say this is a story about a young woman in school and boy she gradually grows fond of, and he also falls for her. As time grows and their fondness is realized the secret histories they know little about begins to affect their relationship in profound ways. The only way to resolve these issues is to dig into their families' pasts. There's nothing easy about that process.",1381795200,,1452,4.653696498054475

Not what most people classify as anime at all but real gems of animated movies. Disney imported most of them over the years. From Up on Poppy Hill came in independently, for some reason, but is no less a stellar effort. If you liked any of the other Studio Ghibli efforts, then get this one by all means. I guess my all time favorite is Howl's Moving Castle but nonetheless, this is tops in the list now as well.

The English/American voice talent is first rate and does not appear to be dubbed in, matching the animation very well. Again, the artwork, detail, and story line are flawless and make every Studio Ghibli movie a special experience.",1381708800,,747,4.452554744525547
5529597,5,B00AZI9JP4,"This movie is definitely something to have in your collection.

This is an upbeat charmer of a movie from the Studio Ghibli camp. The characters are older than a lot of the prior movies I have seen. Characters either have responsibilities or on the verge of gaining some. There is this constant balancing of youthful naivety, responsibility, and those high school emotions that allow this movie to stand out. I don't necessarily find some of the situations in the movie to be entirely realistic, but they do serve a metaphorical and emotionally tying purpose.

This is the kind of movie where you will enjoy the ride through to the end. There are plenty comedic antics and hilarious characterizations, and all of these stem from the personality and emotional depth of a story where so much seems unfair. A few rambunctious high school kids remain the underdogs to the inequities of life, and I feel that the story draws its humor and its tension from its ability to stage naivety and inequity under a coming of age type build (for lack of a better phrase). The harsh realities crush the naivety of our characters. In these defeats, the story is finding humor in heartbreak, and the characters develop a new way to combat some of the inequities in life.",1381622400,,1252,4.738532110091743

Without spilling the beans the reason I liked this story so much is because it was lighthearted, fun and I also appreciated historical background.  The interesting mystery of the characters buildup was initially concerning, sad and amazing all at once. If you enjoyed any of Goro or Hayao Miyazaki's past productions this one fits in place. I hope Goro Miyazaki follows his own path, this production proves that he has the ability. As we wish Hayao Miyazaki best wishes and farewell in his retirement I feel this piece with his contributions and influence is an excellent addition to any anime collection.

5529607,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Like many of Studio Ghibli's realism films (as opposed to fantasy), not a lot happens in this movie. That's what I like about it. I love to immerse myself into another world where I am not inundated by chaotic plot twists, high speed chases, and tons of negative energy. This movie is the exact opposite. It is slow, quiet, and thoughtful, which is not to say that it is shallow. The emotions in this movie run deep, but the characters/director don't try to bash you over the head with them, but allows you to ride along and soak in the gorgeous scenery.  I am not Japanese and have never lived in Japan, but after watching this movie, I wish I could live in that idealized version of Yokohama in the early 60's. It actually made me nostalgic for a time that I was never part of!

If you are looking for a fast paced, over the top extravaganza like ""Spirited Away"", this movie is not for you. This movie is also not really for kids. It's pretty ""clean"" but the pacing of the movie is geared towards grown ups.

The movie then takes you through the process of finding out the truth. I wish we could have enjoyed it more, but everyone seemed to share the same opinion after it was over, which was ""it was just ok"". I also couldn't imagine ever watching it again, unlike the other ghibli movies which we have watched many times.

I have seen all Miyazaki's works and indeed I find some of them to be rather mundane (for example, I did not enjoy Arrietty at all).
However, Poppy Hill is a great movie - it definitely is my favorite right behind Totoro.
It has all great elements - loss, romance, coming of age, etc.
I haven't had a good cry (Umi's dream sequence) in a movie for a while. :)
Watch this movie with your loved ones and I am sure that you will enjoy this gentle, wonderful film.

All to no avail. By the time 20 minutes had passed I was ready to hit the stop button. Nothing worked for me -- not the characters, the plot, or even the animation. One of the strengths of Hayao's films has been the confidence in his storytelling, where he let the film unfold at its own pace -- including those stunning visuals that captured your imagination without a single word spoken. Here the style remains, but none of the wonder. This film has a distinct feeling of desperation about it, with clever events and set pieces thrown in that get in the way of the characters. When it does slow down, it really slows down, relating mundane details such as eating breakfast or a discussion of where and when a meeting will take place. The bland expressions and mediocre dubbing do nothing to help. One critic used the word ""Earthbound"", and though it was meant only as a contrast to Hayao's more spiritual themes, I think the word best represents the film's biggest flaw. It might have been tolerable had it not been for the score. Choosing the right composer can make or break a film, and here Takebe drowns the story with a jazzy, overly cheerful score that is more distracting than anything else.

I know many have praised this film. But for those like me who have come to expect a higher level of quality from Studio Ghibli, it might be wise to sample this film before buying it. For me, sadly, it is the first purchase from Ghibli I've regretted.",1378425600,7,1717,4.5

The animation is beautiful, and reflects the 1960's well. I am always impressed by the seiyuu (Japanese voice actors/actresses).

The story is extravagant in its own way, just like Spirited Away. It leads you to assume the ending when it's not actually true. I enjoyed that part the most.

I remember I shed a tear when I first saw the trailer; the music and Aoi Teshima's soft melodic crooning voice along with the main characters' indirect interaction was so excellent.

I've seen it twice over the past two days and I urge Ghibli fans to buy the Blu-ray.

From Up on Poppy Hill looks like a Studio Ghibli film, and packs quite an emotional punch, but don't expect to see the fantasy element present in most of the studio's classics. This is more like Whisper of the Heart than Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The film is populated by good people doing good things, and there's not a villain in sight. It will appeal to anyone who remembers their childhood, school, young love, and friendship. Like most Ghibli films, it's full of great messages for us and our children.

Umi Matsuzaki (Sarah Bolger) is an eleventh-grader, living in 1963 Yokohama; she takes care of her family and a few boarders while her mother is away studying in the US. She cooks and cleans while trying to maintain her good grades, and is a responsible young woman. One day in school, she meets Shun Kazama (Anton Yelchin). He performs a daredevil stunt to try to gain support for his campaign to save a clubhouse used by him and his friends. Umi and Shun form a friendship that is the heart of the film, but the story isn't quite so simple. This is not just a tale of teen romance; it's the story of a group of young people pulling together to achieve a common goal. Some of the twists are unexpected, and considerably more complicated than those found in typical animated fare.

One of Umi's habits is to raise flags on the pole on her balcony to signal to ships passing in the harbor. I had better not reveal the reason for that, but it's far from trivial and will help you to empathize with her situation. Umi's world is constantly changing. Her small town has a real community feel, and it's common for people to be friendly and help one another in their daily lives. The bigger picture shows Tokyo preparing for the 1964 Olympics, so there's constant pressure to join modern society and leave behind some of the antiquated life that Umi is used to.

One of the high points is seeing how the students work together to renovate their dirty old clubhouse, and the daring way in which Shun, Umi, and a friend attempt to get their message heard by someone who is actually in a position to make a difference.

Some of the themes in From Up on Poppy Hill are pretty serious. I know that I have probably failed to capture the interest of many readers, because this is another Studio Ghibli film without significant conflict. Instead of an evil villain, we are shown some of the problems young people might face while growing up. One twist is heartbreaking, and I won't dare reveal it here. However, I will say that by the end of the film, the mood is extremely positive. Like all good dramas, there must be some challenges and heartbreak in order for us to appreciate the good things in life. When the film ended, I was smiling. I wish my world could be as idyllic and charming.

I'm sure some of you are wondering about Goro Miyazaki's direction, and whether the future of Studio Ghibli is in good hands with Hayao Miyazaki's (72) retirement announced, and Toshio Suzuki (65) probably approaching the end of his career. Goro Miyazaki received plenty of criticism for Tales of Earthsea (2006), and openly admitted that he played it safe and didn't try to extend himself. From Up on Poppy Hill is a much stronger effort, and I hope it enables him to produce works of similar quality in the future. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay with Keiko Niwa, and I'm sure that it helps make the film feel familiar, and as warm as other Studio Ghibli entries.

Many of the established Ghibli traits are present. I love that the female characters are so strong; something that Pixar could learn from. The importance of family, friendship, and mutual respect is always on display. The young and the old both have a place in the world, and they care about one another. Notice also the scenes involving food. I can remember so many similar scenes from other Ghibli films. Perhaps they are present to remind us how good something as simple as a pleasant meal can be? There's also an umbrella; it's amazing how often they appear in Ghibli's other worlds.

Before I close, I must mention the Blu-ray special edition. Unlike most US Ghibli releases, this one is released by GKids and Cinedigm. The picture quality is wonderful, and the audio features both US and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 mixes. I was startled a couple of times by the immersive output from the rear speakers. The package includes a DVD, so you can introduce a new fan to Ghibli, and a rather informative 16-page booklet. Hayao Miyazaki talks about how the project originated, and Goro talks about his work on the film. The special features total more than three hours, and include the film in storyboard form, plus interviews with Goro Miyazaki and Hayao Miyazaki. For those who like to watch the film in the original language, the subtitles are white and unobtrusive.

Ghibli fans, or anyone who cares about life, people, and good storytelling, should not miss this release.

5529645,5,B00AZI9JP4,"""From Up on Poppy Hill"" was definitely under my radar.  I am a Miyazaki fan and I eagerly await anything from this illustrious studio.  Yet somehow I missed the US theatrical release of this film.  I only discovered this Japanese language DVD on Amazon.  It is a film by Goro Miyazaki son of Hiyao Miyazaki the world's greatest animator.  The elder Miyazaki did contribute to the story but Goro is the director.

One thing a viewer should understand, Japanese animation is not necessarily a child's medium.  This film touches on things your six year old will not understand.  This is a `PG' film not `G'.

This is a period piece set in Yokohoma, Japan.  The year is 1963. World War II has been over for almost twenty years.  The current generation is coming of age.  With the Olympics coming to Japan in 1964, there is a huge push to show the world a new Japan.  It's time to set old things aside and usher in the new era.

Umi  Matsuzaki is 16 years old.  She lives in an old hospital owned by her family overlooking the harbor.  Her medical professor mother is training in the US.  She lives with her grandmother, three borders and her younger brother and sister.  Despite the presence of the grandmother, Umi is the true head of household, preparing meals, doing laundry, keeping the books, etc.  Her one eccentricity is each morning, she raises maritime signal flags in a ritual honoring her late father, a supply ship officer killed during the Korean War.

At her school, Konan Academy, she finds out someone has been watching her morning ritual when she reads an anonymous poem in the school paper.  It seems she has an anonymous admirer. On the campus of the school is a large old building called the Latin Quarter.  It is used by the boys of the school as a club house for their various extracurricular activities including the school paper.  The school's board is considering demolishing the building a move objected to by the Student Body President Shiro Muzunuma and his best friend Shun Kazama, son of a tugboat captain.  At lunch, the Shun performs a daring stunt seen by most of the students to promote their protest.

In the instant he jumps his eyes connect with Umi.  While this can't possibly be the first time they see each other, it is the first time they really see each other.  A connection is made and it is the beginning of their romance.  But Shun is adopted and the story of his origin could derail this relationship before it really gets started.....
This is a Japanese film done in traditional hand-drawn animation.  It is absolutely beautiful. I really wish I'd seen this on a big screen.  Being forced to read the subtitles do not take away from the cinematic experience.

There are cultural as well as temporal differences.  Remember this is a period piece.  The children wear uniforms to school.  The amount of detail is incredible. Light and shadow in the animation imitates life.  Shun's father stands at the wheel of his tugboat erect (like the former naval petty officer he'd been).  His eyes miss nothing and he turns the wheel with confidence and no wasted motion.

Shiro is a subtle character.  He is a brilliant student academically as well as socially.  He runs the student body and misses nothing. Shun is his best friend and partner in all his endeavors.  The boys complement each other.  Shiro is cool, calm, caring but calculating.  Shun is bold, dashing and courageous.

This relationship is best illustrated during a spirited student debate over whether or not to demolish the Latin Quarter.  It's also the most hilarious scene in the film.  Don't worry I won't spoil it for you.....

The romance between Umi and Shun is the centerpiece of the film.  These are high school students in 1963.  There is latent sexual tension but that is not the point of this relationship.  This is the love we feel when we are happy just being together.  They are afraid to touch each other. But they hate to be apart.  Goro Miyazaki has his father's talent for romantic scenes.  Randomly meeting Umi on the street, Shun gives her a ride on his bicycle.  I know that does not sound like much but when you see it in the movie you will understand the emotional impact of this scene.

Anyway I think I have written enough.  If you are looking for space aliens, car crashes or alien invaders this is not the movie you want.  However, if you want to see quality animation, intelligent characters that you grow to know and love and a great film, this is something you should see.",1371168000,4,4502,4.627848101265823
5529646,4,B00AZI9JP4,"I have not seen Goro Miyazaki's other film, ""Tales from Earthsea"" (which did not get terribly good reviews) but I definitely liked this one a lot.  Of course, it was scripted by his father, Hayao Miyazaki, which cannot hurt.  Of all the other Ghibli films I've seen, this one most closely resembles the wonderful ""Whisper of the Heart,"" only the music is not nearly as good here.

The movie's period setting is very interesting; the high-school antics are amusing; the characters are all likable, and the heroine's story of loss and first love is sweetly told, although it threatens to take a slightly ""creepy"" turn at one point.  Of course, if you already go in with the expectation that everything will turn out all right in the end, you can ride over that bump.

The animation, colors, backgrounds, etc., are all top-notch, as one expects from Ghibli.

I believe this is coming out in English ""sometime soon,"" but if you do not want to wait, this is a very good deal right now.",1371081600,,980,4.635838150289017

As usual, the characters are delightful and the ending is equally a treat. It looks at how things used to be and if you have every lived in or visited Japan during this period of time, you will recognize a great deal of the surroundings. Enough from me. Buy this one. You will be so glad that you did. I've viewed it at least a half dozen times in the last few weeks and it is just as delightful the last time as it was the first.",1370131200,8,741,4.117241379310345

From Up on Poppy Hill (Kokuriko-zaka Kara) is nothing less than the best Studio Ghibli film since 2004's Howl's Moving Castle, possibly even since 2001's Spirited Away. Directed by Goro Miyazaki from a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa, From Up on Poppy Hill is based on a 1980 serialized Japanese graphic novel of the same name, illustrated by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsuro Sayama. The animation is lush and lovingly detailed, and the story an engaging tale of two high school students dealing with first love and with the importance of the past, both on a cultural and institutional level, and, as it turns out, on an intimately personal level as well.

The story is set in 1963 in the port town of Yokahama in Japan in 1963 against the backdrop of the country getting ready to host the 1964 Olympic Games. Umi Matsuzaki is a sixteen-year-old high school girl living with her family and a couple of boarders in a house on top of a hill that overlooks the harbor. Her mother Ryoko, a medical professor, is currently away, studying abroad in the United States. In her mother's absence, Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings, Sora and Riku, and her grandmother, Hana. The boarders, both women, are an artistic college student named Sachiko Hirokouji and a doctor-in-training named Miki Hokuto. Umi's father, we learn, died many years ago when Umi was quite young, killed when his cargo ship hit a mine during the Korean War. As a kind of ritual to his memory, each morning Umi raises a set of naval signal flags up a flagpole outside the house with the message ""Safe Voyage"" to the ships out in the harbor.

One day, an anonymous poem about the flags appears in the school newspaper. Curious, Umi decides to visit the school newspaper to ask who wrote the poem. The school paper is published out of an office located in a delapidated old building on the school grounds nick-named ""the Latin Quarter"" which houses all of the school clubs and has done so for as long as anyone can remember. But the Latin Quarter is now endangered by a plan to tear it down and replace it with a brand new building as part of Japan's modernization program to put on its best face for the upcoming Olympics, a move that has the students divided between those who want everything to be new and those who have an emotional attachment to the old and traditional, which they see embodied by their beloved Latin Quarter.

On the way to visit the paper's office, Umi, accompanied by Sora, witness another student, Shun Kazama, performing a daredevil stunt to get publicity for the paper's ""Save the Latin Quarter"" drive. Umi is somewhat less than impressed by Shun's feat, but when she reaches the school paper office, she discovers that Shun, along with his friend Shiro Mizunuma who is the student government president, is the publisher of the school paper (and also, as she learns later, the author of the poem about her flags). Before she knows it, Umi is volunteering to help, first with the paper, preparing stencils, and then soon with their drive to save the Latin Quarter. She suggests that the best way to start would be to give the building a complete facelift, first with a thorough cleaning and then with much needed repairs and a fresh paint job. In this cause, Umi enlists the school's female student population, which in turn gets the male students guickly - and enthusiastically - on board.

As they work together, Umi and Shun start feeling a growing attraction to each other. But the path of young love is rarely smooth, and theirs is thrown for a bigger curve than most when Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men, one of whom is her deceased father. But Shun has seen this photograph before, and suddenly a past neither of them were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun. From that point on, the twin plot threads - of Umi and Shun and their pasts and of the students' crusade to save the Latin Quarter - are subtly intertwined. To say more would be to spoil the story.

The animation in From Up on Poppy Hill is wonderfully detailed and executed in so many ways it would take a long time to properly describe them. The Latin Quarter clubhouse is a marvel of clutter, completely believable as the sort of old place whose every corner would be filled with incredibly varied bric-a-brac due to the myriad kind of clubs it houses (and going for years without a proper cleaning because that's not typically a high priority with most boys).

Another thing I particularly liked were the subtle changes in the backgrounds as evening approached in some scenes; you could feel the sun slowly beginning to set with the ever-so-slight lengthening of shadows and changes in the hue of the sky. Equal detail was given to the way the characters moved and the things they did. In one scene, when Umi is preparing dinner, she pours the rice into a square box, then carefully runs a flat edge over the top to level it so that the amount measured out is exact. It's a minor detail not dwelled upon, but one of many similar ones that give the film a depth of reality rarely found in most animated films.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful animation, engaging characters and truly first-class story-telling that never condescends to its audience.",1369699200,153,5548,4.683076923076923

There's not much overt action here, except when Umi brings her domestic skills to bear in saving a beloved landmark. Really, it's more the emotional rollercoaster ride of a girl's early teen years, an animated chick flick. And, sad to say, I review this with the sensibilities of a non-chick person.

I can't fault the animation, though. The characters are skilfully drawn, but the backgrounds are glorious. Luminous, painterly, elegant - when the plot dragged, I let myself fall into the gorgeous background artwork.

5529663,3,B00AZI9JP4,"Although this film comes from Studio Ghibli, do not expect the usual fantasy or magical realism of Hayao Miyazaki. Poppy Hill is a drama that just so happens to be animated, a relatively common thing in Japan, which takes its anime very seriously.

The film is mostly about Umi - her role in saving the clubhouse, her heartbreak over the death of her father, and the reconciliation of that pain through Shun entering her life. Poppy Hill is very much a ""slice of life"" film, one that shines in the small spaces, the usual meticulous attention to detail we come to expect from Ghibli, but is rather bland in the way of plot. There are touching moments, too, but nothing in the way of dramatic twists or emotional impact.

I suspect that this film has far more relevance to people in Japan, as there are references to the Korean War, which had a much different impact there than in the West, and to the 1964 Olympics, which was hosted in Tokyo to much national pride. For those not steeped in Japanese culture and history - as I am not - there is not much *to* Poppy Hill, except to enjoy the gorgeous animation and to peer through a small window into a very specific time in Japanese history.",1360195200,30,1191,4.458715596330276
5529664,1,B00AZI9JP4,"This is probably a not legal production although it looks very professional
It starts with a flash of a commercial.
The sound is horrible. The soundtrack music is loud, the sound volume of characters speaking is practically
not understandable because of too low volume vs soundtrack.
In the end I cannot use this DVD and I'd like my money back.",1355443200,21,344,4.75
5529665,5,B00AZI9JP4,"Set in the early 1960s in Yokohama, From Up on Poppy Hill details the story of 16yo Umi Matsuzaki. Umi's father is dead. Her mother, a doctor,  is away in the United States. Living at home, Umi remains the dutiful young Japanese female teenager. She wakes early to set the rice cooking. She prepares lunches. She takes care of her grandmother (loved seeing her still in her traditional kimonos) and her younger sisters while her mother is away. She raises the signal flags outside her home, because that's what her father and she used to do together before he was killed in the Korean War. She goes to school and is a good student. One day at school she finds herself the subject of a poem. A poem that is romantic! Who could have written it? As if that were not enough trouble, Shun Kazama, the local heartthrob, jumps down from high up on a building. Right in front of her!! This causes the entire school to focus on her.

Suddenly Umi finds herself taken to Quartier Latin, a local club housed in an old worn-down building, by her younger Sora who wants an autograph from Umi. It is there that she encounters Shun again. This charming building is the subject of much fierce debate about its usefulness and its future. The governing body of the school wish it to be torn down and so do the majority of the students of the school. Umi finds herself caught between the battling philosophies waging war against Japan. As Japan throws itself headlong into the future while readying itself for the 1964 Olympics that will be held in Tokyo, people are everywhere tearing down old buildings, forgetting the past, and distancing themselves from the culture of their parents. Others resist this movement and try to preserve as much of the past as they can. Here is a Studio Ghibli film that you will find in many other films - the idea of balance. While elsewhere that balance is between the human world and the environment, here Studio Ghibli explores the idea of balance between the past and present and future. The character of Umi suggests that the building could be spruced up and maybe that would sway popular opinion. And so Umi, Shun, and the students of the school find themselves racing to battle ""progress"".

The secondary story line concerns the relationship between Umi and Shun. To describe it in detail would be to ruin certain surprises that add a certain degree of drama to the movie. This relationship is a poignant, quiet one and as beautifully done in any Studio Ghibli film.

I have now watched every single Studio Ghibli film (and if you click on my name you can see my reviews of those films). From Up on Poppy Hill is in the spirit of Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, and Ocean Waves. Most Americans are familiar with the more fantastical Studio Ghibli films - think Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, but I tend to find that films like From Up on Poppy Hill touch both my heart and mind more than the fantastical films. That's just my opinion and my favorite Studio Ghibli film still remains the fantastical My Neighbor Totoro. From Up on Poppy Hill is a worthy addition to the Studio Ghibli cannon and shows greater maturity from Gor Miyazaki (the directory of the terrible Tales From Earthsea). Now I am looking forward to Takahata's The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, which will be released sometime in 2013.",1354320000,41,3336,4.6300675675675675

8559633,5,B00AZI9JP4,I am slowly making my way through the Miyazaki films and am nearing the end when this film popped up on my list. It is a lesser known Miyazaki film compared to all the other big names but please do not miss out on watching this film. The story line is entertaining and grabs you and pulls you into the adventure. The characters are relatable to easy to start caring about right from the beginning of the movie. I am slightly saddened it took so long for me to get to this film but I am finally glad I have seen it. I highly recommend for all ages and is worth the time to site down and enjoy.,1527984000,,592,4.02542372881356
8559634,3,B00AZI9JP4,"This film was visually fantastic and had a great soundtrack that really blends in well. The story in the other hand is somewhat lacking. For a story that  focuses on love, drama and youth it has no consistency to it.  The two main protagonists (Shun and Umi) who like  each other to only find out that they are posssibly siblings don't show any real connection. Its  obvious they  have feelings for each from start of the movie but there are no other signs than their  constant love stares. Their  conversations are dead ends leading up to no real breaking points of their relationship other than them finding out they could be siblings. Which brings me to other point, when finding out they have the same father, he is undersell. What I mean is that we don't see much of what kind of person he was and how important he was other than being their father.

Spoiler ahead: but I think I bring a good point, read if you want.

Then It gets confusing at the end because the story is mainly about shun and Umi having the same dad only to find out they don't have the same dad. Instead of shun being the son of Umis dad , he was actually the son of Umis dads FRIEND??This would have been okay but he is not mention once in the story. They could have added a flash back of when both fathers were at war and how they were really good friends  but no we get a one min scene of them a taking picture together.

Finally The story could have been been resolved by removing the concept of the school trying to rebuild their club house. Thus adding scenes of the two fathers connection and mainly they could have focus more on shun and umis relationship.",1527465600,,1640,4.309446254071661
