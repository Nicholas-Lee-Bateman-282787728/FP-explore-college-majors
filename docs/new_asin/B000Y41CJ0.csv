8230911,5,B000Y41CJ0,Excellent! We used this DVD to wrap up our homeschool lesson on Michelangelo. The kids were entertained! The price was very steep though.....so not sure I'll be purchasing any more if the price is the same.,1412899200,,206,4.75
8230912,5,B000Y41CJ0,"Believe it or not, they've really done it with this one:  a video that will provide great groundwork for children's understanding of famous art and witty humor that will crack up the adults.

Great animation integrated with photos, visually engaging, and still funny when you hear it for the 15th time.  We highly recommend them all, but Michelangelo is our favorite.

I am a teacher and use these in summer school with K-8th grade.  It keeps the attention of all students and we learn a lot.  The videos do a good job putting interesting facts about the artists' lives, interests, hobbies and art styles.  They use comedy to keep it entertaining.",1237248000,2,398,4.486111111111111
