8283311,5,B001BJL8EG,"The third volume of ""HARUKA ~Beyond the Stream of Time~ A Tale of the Eight Guardians"" continues as the search for the remaining guardians continues.

The sixth episode titled ""The Vice Minister and the Imperial Palace Demon"", we are introduced to Vice Minister of Civl Affairs Fujiwara-no-Takamichi who meets a dancer named Shirin.

All the nobleman are intoxicated by her beautiful figure and graceful performance (with the exception of Fujiwara-no Takamichi) but of course, it is all part of Akram's plan as Shirin is a demon who will try to infiltrate the Imperial Palace.

While Akane is granted an audience with the Emperor, she overhears the hypnotized nobles talking about assassinating the Emperor. Will Akane be able to get help in time or will she be caught by Shirin?

Episode 7 is titled ""The Night Cry of the Nue"", a white-winged vengeful spirit has appeared at Daimonji Mountain and threatening people there. For Yorihisa, he knows the ""Nue"" too well. The Nue, since as a child, has been Yorihisa's target to kill but at the same time, because of their battles, he has looked at him as a friend. But the last living member of the Nue has never been violent? Why is it threatening humans?

Nevertheless, Akane and the vengeful spirit are sent to drive out the Nue and for Yorihisa, a last encounter with his friend/rival.

Episode 8 is titled ""The Flame of Demon Hatred"" and the storyline focuses on Inori (a character introduced in the first episode). We learn that Inori lives a tough life as an apprentice for a blacksmith and protects his sick elder sister. While delivering a sword to a samurai, Inori meets Akane for the first time but their meeting is interrupted when the demon Shirin returns.

The third volume of ""HARUKA"" continues to be enjoyable so far. The search for the remaining guardians continues and for this volume, two more are found.

If anything, the focal point in this volume is more on three of the guardians. Fujiwara-no-Takamichi, Yorihisa and Inori.

One of the things I wondered is how much character development can be done, with so many characters involved in the actual storyline. For episode 6, it was good to know Fujiwara-no-Takamichi's side. Not necessarily a boring character but a character that seems dedicated to his work and keen on logic.

As for Yorihisa, again we see a sensitive side of the character. A dedicated warrior and guardian but obviously a man who very much wants to protect Akane.

As for Inori, he has witnessed countless murders of villagers by the demons that he is literally bent on ridding them.

But in episode 8, it was interesting when Shimon (Akane's blonde and blue-eyed friend) is accused of being a demon. Reason being is that in Japan, a person with blonde hair and blue eyes is completely different from the norm and also the only person with blonde and blue eyes so far in the series outside of Shimon is the main demon himself, Akram. So, it is going to be interesting to see how Shimon deals with the prejudice towards him, as everyone is going to think he is a demon but also, how he is going to defend himself and even Akane since he is pretty much the weakest of the Guardians due to his fear and his emotions.

""HARUKA ~Beyond the Stream of Time~"" continues to be anime series that has not disappointed me at all.

So, far the first three volumes have featured the search for the remaining guardians, if anything, the only thing we didn't see on this volume, which I don't mind so much at all, is Akram and Akane together.

What we do see is the demon Shirin who is dedicated to her master but jealous because he has so much interest towards the Priestess.

But it's good to see how each episode has had some spacing, in terms of the search for the remaining guardians and in this case, more character development for Yorihisa.

All in all, ""HARUKA ~Beyond the Stream of Time~"" continues to be a beautiful, well-acted and enjoyable series to follow so far and look forward to how it's leading up to the possible battle between the forces of good and evil. Not sure how it's going to play out but I look forward to how the series is progressing so far.

A series worth checking out!",1218153600,,4174,4.648097826086956
