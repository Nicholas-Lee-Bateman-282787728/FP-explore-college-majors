8215049,5,B0000844HO,"I purchased  this DVD purely for the section on the Burton-Taylor insight and that is the only bit I have watched so far and is a well constructed account. Now that the long lens of the worlds press scrutinising every move this couple made has long since gone we can now reflect on the phenomenon of Burton/Taylor that swept and so raptured the world with a different perspective. There is something about the Burton-Taylor  partnership that seems to be so engrained into public consciousness that it still resonates today. It is one of those phenomena like how does a bird know how to fly? Because it's programmed to do so, I feel the same about Burton/Taylor it just seems to be part of our programming, part of our being. Maybe it's the idea of the perfect existence that could not survive the harsh realities of life.
I found the piece on Burton poignant, tragic, sad and a bit tearful.  The images towards the end of the mini-documentary of Burton's funeral  is well told and even leaves you with a sense of your own personal loss.  In all my readings about Burton it seems that public persona was very different to the private man and that we may now never truly know the real Richard Burton. Burton is synonymous with, well  BURTON, there is just no other way to describe it.",1313625600,,1282,4.552173913043478
