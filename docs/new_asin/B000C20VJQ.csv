8095395,4,B000C20VJQ,"Although I could tell that this movie was low budget, i thought it was pretty good. I appreciated the premise, because all young black actors today seem to be rappers. The filming is a bit artsy and a little slow moving at first, but hang in there. It's worth it! A pretty good effort.",1141776000,2,285,4.296296296296297
8095396,1,B000C20VJQ,"I cannot even put into words the agonizing despair I wallowed in while watching this movie.  If you told me they'd filmed this with high-school video club equipment and spent 30 cents a piece on acting lessons, I would have believed you...I would have been amazed.

The people who filmed the TV show ""Homeboys in Outer Space"" should have won a grammy if this is what film making has come down to.  You'd be better off renting the ""Meatballs"" series and watching them repeatedly, while smacking yourself in the face with something slimy and painful.

Not to hate on the filmmakers...because I'm sure they're going to read this...hopefully while looking for new occupations...but come on?  Are you serious?

Henry Winkler...who by the way I never saw, because I turned the movie off before I auto asphyxiated...should officially relinquish his reputation as The Fonz. Of course, what did I expect after the ""Scream"" movies?

If Ted Danson wasn't cool when he filmed ""Made in America""...what the hell did he think THIS was going to do for his career?  Do agents even read scripts anymore?

This actually made ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" funny.  This actually made the WB funny.  Of course, I should have known better, when the same three people (neither one of them Danson OR Winkler) produced, executive produced, wrote, designed, acted in, and wrote the theme music. Keep an eye out for this during the opening credits people...it's a good clue to turn it off.

I could go on forever, but that would be giving this movie too much credit.  I've seen porn movies filmed in the laundry rooms of tenemant slum buildings..wait...err..i've HEARD of porn movies filmed in the laundry rooms of tenemant slum buildings...that were Gone With the Wind compared to this movie.

If you want to see something really hilarious...you should go to ""[...]"" and read the rave reviews people gave this movie...one guy actually THANKED the producers for bringing it to the screen.

You just wait until I complete the bureaucratic registration nonsense for THAT site...I'm going to make that guy wish he'd been born with his head in a plastic bag.

Props to amazon for letting people just sign in and start ranting...first amendment THAT G.W.

People should not be able to release their community college film projects in Hollywood Video.  Shame on whoever ""fronted"" the money for this movie.",1140480000,2,2364,4.941772151898734
