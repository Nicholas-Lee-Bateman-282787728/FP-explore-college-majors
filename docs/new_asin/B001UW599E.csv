If nothing else, this show makes you open your mind a little and think of other possibilites.",1241913600,7,246,4.833333333333333
3815237,1,B001UW599E,"*****I had previously placed this review on the product for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-s-Mysteries-Ancient-Aliens-History-Channel/dp/B000WP09PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History's Mysteries - Ancient Aliens (History Channel)</a>, only to realize it was the wrong program.  So I deleted that one and re-submitted it here as proper.******

This version heavily features Erich von Daniken and his book ""Chariot of the Gods""

I'm one to easily give credence to virtually any crazy and insane and far-out theory regardless of evidence. As such, things like this appeal to me.

Without any real evidence, I'm still highly entertained by the conjecture that certain petroglyphs featuring humanoid figures with helmets or sculptures of ""men"" with helmets and similarly odd things could be linked to aliens having visited earth in ancient pre-history.

It even digs into the Bible, looking to figures such as Enoch who provide vivid details that sound fantastical and supernatural on their own, but when told in the contextual possibility of alien life, sounds entirely like what it could be; a pre-historical man describing alien encounters in the best way he can.

Programs like these draw me to deeper research and theories on ancient aliens found online, and even to discover a very entertaining (though totally BS) ""timeline"" of Earth history before the great Biblical flood of Noah/Gilgamesh/Etcetera, involving a planet colonized by aliens for resource harvesting, and Homo Sapien being a genetically engineered result of these aliens mixed with Homo Erectus.

If any of this sounds like crazy, kooky, whack-job, ridiculous BS to you, then you are likely of the same mind as the producers of this program.

Either the people who made this went completely overboard in their excitement to present such theories on the History Channel, or they intentionally designed it in such a subtle and sneaky way as to completely discredit all such theories by portraying everything in such a skewed view, that even if you do lend some credence to these theories, you'll be baffled at how easily these ""experts"" set themselves up for very crushing and very harsh scientific rebuttal.

For example: The artifacts

The series shows some artifacts including cave paintings of what are supposedly astronauts floating in space, with their legs bent (as if in zero gravity) and helmets and the like, as well as sculptures of bipedal creatures with large helmets that look like oldy-time Scuba helmets, or arguably astronaut helmets.

While these are very interest things, they are far too ambiguous to be directly labeled as ""influenced by extraterrestrials"" and yet the ""experts"" and speakers of the series proceed to do exactly that. For one sculpture of a Mayan head, one of the ""experts"" says ""It's clearly just like modern-day astronauts' helmets. You see here's the glass, over his mouth is a breathing apparatus, and down here is the control panel""

The ""breathing apparatus"" is just some decoration that happens to cover the man's mouth, and the ""control panel"" is yet further decoration like an amulet or a pendant or a symbol of some sort. The sculpture itself at first glance looks more like an elaborate Mayan headdress of a chieftain than an astronaut, and to immediately suggest it looks like an astronaut's helmet implies you are actively seeking an alien-related link.

Another sculpture looks for the life of me like a person with their head stuck in a conical structure, yet they claim right away it's someone in a rocket ship.

The biggest example of all is the sarcophagus (mispelled?) of Pakal II, called ""The Great"". Supposedly he was over 7 feet tall, and as such they presumed he could be one of three things: an unnaturally tall Mayan, a man from a foreign land who became king, or an alien.

Quite frankly, I have only to believe he was a Mayan, as all the sculptures of him are quite traditionally that of a Mayan man, and this is the same program claiming that so-called ""aliens"" were depicted as strange-looking creatures in helmets.

Back to the Sarcophagus, it's a very insanely elaborate depiction of Pakal, looking very lazily reclined on a gigantic and elaborate throne, descending into the underworld upon his death.

The ""experts"" here flip the picture sideways, and begin to see a different image. Where Pakal was laying across a throne, he is now supposedly seated in a cramped seat, with an oxygen mask near his mouth, his hands and feet operating some elaborate controls, and the squiggly things at the bottom of his ""throne"" become exhaust fire.

The image, they claim, is Pakal in a space ship, blasting off into outer space.

In my honest opinion, this is a lively interpretation, but again it is far too arbitrary to be made on one's own without actively seeking an alien link, and when flipped sideways, it honestly looks to me more like Pakal is on a bicycle, or perhaps a flying machine operating like a bicycle.

This is made even worse by the fact that they go out and try to see if ordinary people see the same image. They make it very clear just what they expect by showing it to people SIDEWAYS. Considering the program is about ""ancient aliens"", it's obviously clear they want people to see Pakal in a spaceship.

So despite my interest in the subject, and despite my belief that ancient aliens came to earth (but did not deeply interact), the program goes so wildly crazy and whacky into the subject that they seemingly want to discredit the very notion they are presenting by making the ""experts"" and their theories seem so crazy and one-sided that only a nutjob could believe them.

And I'm only partially a nutjob.",1238976000,17,5707,5.081283422459893

I do however, feel alternative, non-conventional viewpoints have a valid place in the world, but for a program to base itself around the claims of a man caught decades ago in his own lies is unforgivable. Many people admonish The History Channel for airing shows like this and others such as ""UFO Hunters"" and ""Monsterquest."" The big difference is here, those shows, as unfulfilling as they almost always are, at least show more integrity than the blatant misrepresentations made here in the interest of promoting sensational claims as having strong supporting evidence justifying them. The History Channel has betrayed my trust as well as the trust of anyone else that has viewed this documentary. My respect for the network has dropped immensely as a result.

It only asks questions of you to consider the possibility of such an intervention to explain 'inconsistences' in past history.

Answer: They were all created by Kevin Burns.

Kevin Burns (not to be confused with Ken Burns) is a master of the art of TV documentaries. He is one of the most successful men in Beverly Hills, having created over 100 TV documentaries in the past 17 years, and yet you probably know nothing about him.

There is a line from his IMDB biography that I find mildly haunting: ""After the sudden death of his father in 1988, Burns decided the time had come to seek his fortune in Los Angeles."" I struggle to see how that logically follows. Why would the death of a father inspire Hollywood fortune-seeking?

If his film credits are any indication, Burns is an unpretentious guy who loves monsters, celebrities, movies, and sex. (Who doesn't?) But what's fascinating about Burns is that he went from a fraternity president at a private boys' college in NY with a couple of highfalutin majors (English literature and history) to making TV documentaries about playgirls and aliens.

""It's all about good storytelling,"" Burns says in an interview with TV Week. ""It has to be worth your time.""

All of this is interesting context from which to understand Ancient Aliens. It's created by a history major, yes, but it's also created by a guy who is an unabashed fortune-seeker.",1342224000,,1504,4.717557251908397
3815992,4,B001UW599E,"This is the pilot that would launch the Ancient Aliens program on the history channel.  There were similar programs previously given with similar themes aired as UFO's: The First Encounters hosted by Leonard Nimoy. Although i am skeptical of many of the theories postulated I am open to the possibility that our planet could have been visited by beings from another existence in ancient times.  The pilot is entertaining with excellent cinematogrophy and images of places as Nazca lines, easter island, stonehedge etc.

 Unfortunately, i never knew that this episode was already included as a bonus with Season 1.  So you might as well buy Season 1 to get this Pilot episode already included.

There are too many unanswered questions regarding the origins of mankind and I know, being what I consider an intelligent adult, that much of what I learned in school growing up isn't believable to me anymore and some just doesn't make sense.

One day we will face the dark side and we will prevail- and light will rule for all eternity!

With the billions of galaxies each containing billions of stars, it's rather arrogant to think we are all alone, not to mention an incredible waste of space.

One thing that many people fail to grasp is that all of science is theory. Ancient Aliens is a theory which the show provides some compelling evidence to support.

We used to think the earth was flat, that we were the center of the galaxy, that our sun was the center of the universe, that Christopher Columbus discovered America and all dinosaurs were reptiles. All of these have proven to be false.

Even the Catholic Church believes in the possibility of aliens and says that if you believe in life beyond earth it does not go against the God, the bible, or the church.

3816203,5,B001UW599E,"I love Erich von Daniken's work, and this is no exception. The show has brought along great minds like Michael Cremo, Giorgio Tsoukalos, George Noorey, and many other great minds to talk about the things on this Earth that ""...scientists can't answer very well"". This nonsense about the pyramids is so silly that I can not believe that respectable people really think that Egyptians built a 2 mile ramp to get to the top of the pyramid. This is why we have alternative thinks like von Daniken today, to help show us what is up!

Using mathematics, von Daniken shows us that the pyramids could not have been built in only 20 odd years because using math we find that the great pyramid alone would have to have a brick layed in every 9 seconds for the project to have been completed. This being the case, I wonder how those nuts at the ""archeological society"" would answer about how they moved their giant camp back so fast to compensate for the 9 seconds of laying time. Keep in mind that these stones are roughly 2-70 tons, I believe the largest at Giza was something along the lines of 200 tons. 200 tons! that is 400,000 pounds! and yet archeologists want us to believe that these were hauled along the sands by about 10 slaves each pulling on ropes. What nonsense! Then they want us to believe that a spiral ramp was created going around the pyramid to the top, getting a shorter distance to the middle each time the spiral went up a rock. What BS! There is no evidence of that at all because the pyramid is layered on the outside, not spiraled!

I am going off on a rant here, but anyhow, I think any open minded person who watches this will believe in ancient astronauts. Any closed minded person (the self appointed experts) who watch this will think they know better than people like von Daniken who has written 30+ books. Funny how the ego works, ey?

With compelling evidence, watch this if you are an open minded person.

That said, this is a very well produced series.  The production values are wonderful, the 'experts' are well spoken (and with a wonderful touch many have crazy hair - ala mad scientists on the fringe), the on-site videos are very well done and in many cases beautiful.  The announcer sounds like, and could very well be, the same person from many other serious documentaries.

The only downside is the constant jumping from one subject, or ancient culture, to another.  While that creates a dynamic visual montage, it becomes distracting.

3816232,5,B001UW599E,"I remember watching this for the first time on tv and being absolutely blown away. ANCIENT ALIENS, a documentary produced by the History Channel, details a string of theories pertaining to some of humankind's greatest achievements, and how they might not be OUR achievements after all.

With a documentary like this, you really have to press ""play"" with an open mind. The folks at the History Channel have not made it their business in the past to convert people to a certain way of thinking, and they're not starting now. They are objectively displaying a premise that many, including myself, had never heard before.

Most of the film mostly centers around the theories postulated by Erich von Daniken in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chariots-of-the-Gods/dp/0425166805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chariots of the Gods</a>. Most of these theories assert the possibility that extra terrestrials actually intervened in Earth's history, and sort of nudged us down the right path toward creating monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and Teotihuacan, and toward creating things unique for the time, such as the Antikythera Mechanism.

The documentary goes to some very unique places and interviews believers and skeptics alike. The History Channel was very, very thorough in assuring that all the bases were covered. It was a very fun experience, and is now one of my most favorite documentaries.

I realize that in the plothole-ridden history of humanity, there are events that will never be fully understood, and mysteries that will never be solved. Dawkins calls them ""gaps,"" and within such gaps we can see marvelous possibilities of what COULD and MIGHT HAVE happened. In the case of this ""intervention theory,"" it really is no harm, no foul.

The concept is absolutely brilliant (look for a few of the films directly inspired by Daniken's theory:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Kingdom-of-the-Crystal-Skull-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-One/dp/B000AJJNFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica  - Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knowing/dp/B001GCUO02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knowing</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0000844I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate (Ultimate Edition)</a>.

3816237,4,B001UW599E,"It goes without stating that the controversial theory of extraterrestrials interacting with ancient humans works best as a thought-provoking alternative to more widely accepted scientific theories. To expect that irrefutable proof of alien involvement in mankind's past will be presented in this 94-minute TV special is illogical and hypocritical, to say the least. Consider for a moment that the vast majority of ancient artifacts and ruins can only be interpreted by historians and archaeologists as to the original intent, usage, construction, etc. No one knows with absolute certainty how or why the Peruvian Nazca lines were created, or how the ancient pyramids were built, or what the Easter Island statues represent. There are commonly accepted theories (which keep changing or evolving as more evidence is unearthed) and then there are deviant and less ""credible"" theories such as other-worldly intervention. It was certainly never the intent of this special to convince viewers without fail that many of these mysteries were in fact the result of alien meddling. Rather, the aim was to explore this alternative, less popular notion with a mixture of facts and conjecture from the vantage point of proponents and opponents from various fields of study. It is to the History Channel's credit that such a wide spectrum of human interests continue to be explored by the network.

Perhaps this program's greatest strength is the examination of some of mankind's most enduring mysteries, which are fascinating regardless of one's personal beliefs. It is safe to assume that some will find the mysteries themselves more entertaining than any potential explanations or theories. Anyone viewing this special as a repository for factual data will be sorely disappointed as the evidence consists of ruins and artifacts that are thousands of years old, thus interpretations are inevitable. And in this case, much of the evidence revolves around the polarizing theory of ancient aliens visiting Earth. Obviously, not everyone will be convinced by the material presented but that hardly indicates failure on the part of the show or its approach to the subject matter. Not that it is without shortcomings, but this is perhaps the best documentary addressing this topic currently available. It even proved popular enough to spawn on ongoing series which, unfortunately, loses much of the objectivity that this special tried to maintain. Approached from an open-minded perspective, this TV special will be an entertaining viewing experience for many and a sub par effort for others. But as the old adage states, ""for those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible.""",1242086400,105,2702,5.327868852459017
3816238,4,B001UW599E,"Please give this dvd a chance by opening your mind and stepping out of the box that you have built in your lifetime. Certainly the ability to see past what most people have been programmed to believe with regards to our history as human beings is not a common trait. There is a wealth of information available for anyone who will take the time to look for it...some of that information is presented here. The monumental structures and technology that was utilized to build them is exhibited here in some detail, but certainly warrants further investigation. There have never been anything but theories put forth to explain how such advanced building techniques and inexplicable knowledge of the earth existed thousands of years ago. Personally, I can tell you that there is alot of truth to it, and the technology used to build some of these structures, such as the great pyramid in Giza, does not exist even today. Moving the stones and fitting them so tightly, cut with a precision that modern tools could duplicate, but unlikely hammers and chisels would never attain to.
  Another point worth mentioning here is, the fact that this technology has been attributed to the influence of extra-terrestrial beings, this is not necessarily true, since this technology could have existed here on earth in the advanced civilizations of Mu and Atlantis to name two. Human history is older than many people think, and evidence of advanced civilizations in the ancient past is not uncommon, if one is willing to search for answers with an open mind.",1242000000,60,1541,4.900383141762452
