7970351,1,B00006JL1X,"I had a lot of trouble with this tape.  At the beginning, she gives a nice little talk on the value of aerobics, which I did enjoy.
  Something was said someplace about it being for ""baby boomers"" - I am 65 so I thought this would be easier than most tapes.

  But, to me, I have liked other tapes I've had over the years much better - such as Leslie Sansone, Jane Fonda, Richard Simmons, and on tv: Gilead and Sharon Mann.  It might be because the ones I like are broken into segments and cleary explain if you're tired take a break.

  For example, with Richard Simmons, he had a period where he ran around and talked between segments.  And with Lesle Sansone she tells jokes, explains clearly, and runs credits between the first mile and 2nd mile so you get a little rest.
  This tape had a lot of easy movements as far as that goes but it was a lot of fast fast movement.  Also I have a little trouble with twisting as I was in a car wreck years ago......It did not seem like the cool down came soon enough.  I'm not used to taking my pulse in the other tapes I've had so when she had me take my pulse there wasn't time to really figure out her previous explanation of how to know if you're heart is beating too fast.  So I just kept going thinking this is an ""easy"" tape so surely I can do the whole thing.  At the end, I felt like I was spinning.
Today I played the tape over again - and figured my heart rate which I recall from my first time through and I should not have continued.

  Later, I realized from reading online recommendations that you always play a tape through one time before you try it.  Which I wish I had done.

  This is only my experience and I'm no expert on fitness whatsoever.
I just do these tapes and if they tell me to quit if I'm tired, I just do what they say.  For me, I can do the 17-18 minutes of Lesle Sansone with no problem at all.  So I didn't expect this tape would be harder since it said ""easy"" but for me, it was difficult.

  This was only my experience, so I thought I should post it in case someone else might be helped by my experience.  Someone else might do just great but these are my feelings about it.  It did not seem boring as the other review said for me---it seemed very very difficult.",1231718400,3,2247,4.084862385321101
7970352,1,B00006JL1X,"Of the three beginner-level aerobic exercise videos I recently purchased (the other two were Startin' Simple Easy Aerobics and Denise Austin's Xtralite) this was clearly the worst.  I suppose people who have never exercised could learn from the informational portion of the tape.  That is, if they can abide watching a grown woman in a fairy costume trying to sound credible.  The exercises are okay -- but the presentation is boring.  I would rather watch a class or at least a leader with a few other people following the exercises.  And Mirabai Holland, though  knowledgable, is not lively enough to keep me motivated through a half-hour workout.  I do not recommend this video.",1073260800,3,681,4.9734513274336285
