817561,2,6304263422,"The steps are fun and challenging, the dancers are good about looking energetic and making it look fun and funky, but that music is putting me to  sleep over half the time!  I just can't do those steps to that droning  music that can barely chug out a beat.  It's a major handicap I'm afraid.  With better music it would get a much better rating.  Oh, except that some  of the moves will really tear up your shoes.
Definitely don't get this  is you are a klutz - the steps are a little challenging and they are fast  and you barely have time to learn them before you are going to the next  complicated set of steps.",966729600,,615,4.17948717948718
817562,5,6304263422,"I did this video for the first time this week, and I really liked it. Petra Colber (the instructor) has an amazing voice, so when she talks it's not irritating (unlike Denise Austin). The routine is fun and not too hard.  It's a challenge. The cool down music is the best!! It talks about power  and it's definitely encouraging. Plus, there's a music video at the end, so  that's cool too.",933811200,3,389,4.450704225352113
7865900,4,6304263422,"Cardio-wise, this workout is on the lighter side. It's also rather short--I believe the cardio section (minus stretching and cool-down) is only about 20 minutes long. The moves are enjoyable in that they are actual dance moves (albeit a bit dated) versus just atheltic moves/kicks/jumps, etc.

Difficulty-wise, I'd say it's light to light-medium--I'm not a dancer but not a novice either. I was able to follow along all the way through the first time, and in a couple of workouts I got all the moves.

Whenever I do this workout, I combine it with the Reebok Hi-Low Aerobics, because I don't feel I've gotten a decent workout from just this tape alone.

I'd give this workout 3.5 stars if the rating system allowed me to do so.",1169424000,,727,4.708661417322834
7865901,5,6304263422,I would recommend this video to anyone.  It may take you few times to learn all the moves but its fun just trying.  And once you get the jist of it - you're hooked!  It keeps my heart rate up and I have never gotten bored of it - you get out what you put in.,1168819200,,258,3.5714285714285716
7865902,5,6304263422,"This was one of my favorite workout videos.  I think it was supposed to be a dance club-inspired workout because the sets are dark, there are sillouettes of (tasteful) go-go dancers in the background and it even came with an accompanying tape of the music they used in the workout.  I liked Petra's choreography and didn't have trouble following along too much after the first time through, and I've never had dance training.  This workout is about 30 minutes long.",1138752000,2,465,4.7875
7865903,5,6304263422,"I am NOT a dancer by any stretch of the word, but this workout sounded fun so I thought I would give it a try.  I absolutely love this video. Usually I dread working out - but not with this routine.  You can actually look forward to excercise now.  Don't let the other reviews discourage you if you are looking to buy it.  You may have to watch the video a few times before mastering it, but it is well worth the time.",1129593600,,418,4.0
7865904,5,6304263422,"This is a great way to burn fat and lose those extra pounds. The instructor will take you through a dance routine that is fun and uplifting. The routine involves a lot of moves and she uses a lot of dance jargon so if you have never taken dance lessons or if you are not familiar with these terms, you will be lost when she says ""kick, ball, change"", even though she breaks down the move, if you do not have coordination or knowledge of these names, you will be very lost and possibly get frustrated.

If on the other hand, you can kick some butt dancing, then you will feel like in dance class. You'll have a lot of fun, dance to great club music plus sweat and burn claories. Another added benefit is that it's just 30 minutes so it is easy to fit into any schedule. No excuses!",1114473600,,780,4.1655629139072845
7865905,4,6304263422,"I am not fond of aerobic dance styled tapes, but I like this one. Although many of the dances are outdated (ie. the butterfly) I thought this was a fun low impact tape.",1037318400,,168,4.121212121212121
7865906,2,6304263422,"You REALLY have to like to dance to enjoy this video. I was under the impression that it was more athletic with dance-like moves, like Petra's Dance Step video. Very disappointing.",1015459200,,180,4.838709677419355
7865907,4,6304263422,This Sweat Factory exersize video is one of many in my collection that I like working out to. I like the moves because they are not complex. There are only three dancers so you get to see the full body when they move and the music is upbeat. The video is only about thrity minutes long.,1011139200,,286,4.125
7865908,5,6304263422,"This video is outstanding.  Definatley my favorite workout video of the 30+ collection I've gathered over the past 13 years.  Although a little short, the music really gets you moving and keeps you energized even after you've finished with the workout.  (Perfect for those days your schedule my be a little tight).  The steps are lively and fun. Petra's bubbly dispostion has what it takes to keep you coming back for more.  The music video at the end is a real bonus too.  Can't help but look forward to it and dance through it every time!!  A must in your video collection.",991958400,,575,4.578431372549019
