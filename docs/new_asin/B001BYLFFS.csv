3500038,1,B001BYLFFS,"**UPDATE: 9/24/08 - After numerous requests I have ultimately decided to rewrite this review, almost in its entirety.  The first review was posted on 7/14/2008.  My rating has not changed nor have my opinions on this documentary.  However, people have made suggestions in format changes as well as making the content more concise and I think they are good suggestions.  It doesn't matter whether you support ID or Evolution, the review should help people make an educated decision about this product.  Thank you to those who helped with their suggestions and didn't simply write this off because I gave it one star.  This applies to people on both sides of the ID and Evolution argument, you people are truly taking the high road and I appreciate that.

I believe I should clarify something before I delve into the full breadth of my review.  When I first saw this I was ready to give it three stars.  I didn't see any point in questioning Ben Stein's report about people losing their jobs because of their beliefs.  Humanity can be cruel no matter where you are and prejudice can rear its head no matter what the belief.  That being said, I walked out thinking there was a problem starting to sweep the academic community and the only issue I had with the film was its association of Darwin and the Nazis (I'll go more in depth on this later).  I've been quite a fan of Ben Stein's commentary on the economy and many other things.  He seems to be very fair and balanced, thus, based on that perception I didn't have any reason to question his work here.  Until I started doing some research on it, that is.  I went to expelledexposed.com to read the scientific communities response.  I was shocked.  I didn't stop there; I went to freegonzalez.com one of the scientists featured in the documentary.  I may not have looked at every scientist interviewed in detail, but I've seen enough.

Ben Stein shows us a world where Academia's freedom of inquiry might not be so free.  This should be a concern for anyone and everyone.  This undermines the concept that we will be teaching facts and truth in our universities.  However, if you watch how this documentary is formatted you will find that this documentary is overly biased, delving into spectrums of propaganda!  Let me explain.  Stein sets about proving his premise by interviewing scientists that have been rejected by the establishment.  Scientists who have allegedly had their lives ruined because of their belief in something called ""Intelligent Design.""  Science isn't here to persecute people's beliefs and this concept would probably outrage anyone... that is until you realize the lengths he goes to paint science as the root of this evil.

So, we have Stein interviewing scientists that have had their qualifications ruined by the establishment, wouldn't you think Stein should interview people working in the scientific community at the time about this issue?  If this persecution of dissidents was happening I would think he'd go and talk to people still working in the field and cite his examples for scrutiny.  This never happens.  Either Stein is a just a terrible host for a documentary and should stick to the game shows, or he has an agenda.  Stein does interview PZ Myers, Michael Ruse, Eugenie Scott, and the mighty Richard Dawkins for his grand finale, but he never once asks them about the people that were fired or denied tenure.  He only sticks to questions concerning how life began.  He doesn't even really talk to them about why Intelligent Design is rejected by the scientific community versus why evolution is taught.  He never asks these questions.  Michael Ruse, who isn't even credited during his interview (more sloppy documentary work), proposes a possible life beginning scenario involving crystals.  This results in Stein asking him again how it's possible... after Ruse just told him and results in what can be interpreted as a rude response from Ruse.  This style of filming to show scientists as unwilling to entertain the idea of Intelligent Design pushes the viewer to see science as intolerable.  In our overly politically correct society this seems ""mean"" or whatever to people.  Science isn't a democracy; it's based on factual observations.  Intelligent Design cannot provide something observable that can be repeated in a laboratory, that's a fact, not a belief.  So why should science also be politically correct and show ""tolerance"" for things that are blatantly unscientific.  (I know some people will cry conspiracy about evolution, but that's not the point of this documentary.)

Stein also interviewed Berlinski and played favoritism to him in this film, I think, because he was giving the kind of answers Stein could agree with.  That shouldn't be the point of something you're making to generate awareness.  He goes into his grand finale with Dawkins.  I'm not going to try and defend Dawkins' embarrassing answer for him; I agree with others that he's a better writer (though I do admire him for trying to speak out for the side of science).  Long story short, Stein pushed Dawkins to come up with an answer of how life began and Dawkins naturally replied that he didn't know.  He actually replied with ""I don't know"" multiple times until we come to a cut scene where it shows Dawkins proposing that aliens could have possibly seeded life on the planet.  If you notice Dawkins' tone of voice and mannerisms it's pretty clear he didn't even believe his comment.  So why say it?  I have no idea; I also have no idea how long this paltry debate between Dawkins and Stein went on until Stein finally got some ammunition to help his point along.

As further proof of this rather slanted take on the subject, I submit the whole Nazi/Holocaust association with science.  I'm sorry, but what does that have to do with freedom of inquiry in the present day academic community?  For me Stein is simply reaching at straws and he's really out to demonize science.  As someone told me, he was quoted as saying ""Science leads to killing.""  After seeing this relation in the midst of his documentary I can see why he believes it, but that doesn't mean he's right.  Not to mention Hitler was influenced by a lot more than just Darwinian Theory, just read ""Mein Kampf"" and you'll see him quote another document called ""The Protcol's of the Elders Zion.""  Hitler basically repeated the anti-Semitic theories from that document almost verbatim concerning his prejudice.  Not to mention the Nazi practice of ""survival of the fittest"" doesn't even correlate with Darwin, because mankind is meddling at that specific point.  Nature isn't in control over who is the ""fittest"" the Nazi party and other humans were.  Just because the Nazis don't understand what it means or want to skew it doesn't mean it was all Darwin's fault.  Either way, apparently he forgets why we understand the cause of Small Pox and can create a vaccine or how penicillin works and is just focusing on those who made things like the atomic bomb.  I'm well aware that Darwin influenced the Nazi scientists, but this has nothing to do with the scientists supposedly being fired today.

In the end I was left realizing the immense piece of propaganda I had viewed.  After I sat down and analyzed what I saw and did some research this swiftly dropped to a one star rating.  There is simply no excuse for this and whether you support Intelligent Design or Evolution, it doesn't matter; you should not want Stein representing you on this case.  You should not want this documentary to be used as your ""proof"" against the establishment.  ""Expelled"" is propaganda and you can even tell that from the way it's filmed.  If you must see it, then do the research to back it up on both sides.  Regardless if you believe his points or think that Gonzalez should be freed, you have to ask yourself ""why didn't he ask Richard Dawkins or PZ Myers or any of the other scientists about the firings and losing of tenure?""  If you don't have an answer for this then you know this film isn't on the level.

P.S.  This is an abridged review from the original.  I think this stands as my full review for just the film.  Hopefully this improved/rewritten review will come across as being more useful for those reading.",1215993600,"2,003",8252,4.808238636363637
3500039,5,B001BYLFFS,"First of all, I can not believe the amount of comments that have been posted against this documentary with little to no basis for their arguments other than the very same fallible and questionable material. But then it should come as no surprise.

Speaking from my own personal experience with the education system and the whole debate regarding evolution and intelligent design (or creationism) - I was raised at first to believe that the theory of evolution was true. Like so many of the people on here, perhaps. However, even as a little girl, I found the facts that were given about evolution were very patchy at best. If one thing was proven to be possibly true by the theory, it wouldn't explain the rest and certainly not with the same results. Such simple things that we take for granted, I was curious about finding out why they were here and how everything came to be. And the the more I researched into the material about it (using the same materials that ""supposedly"" prove evolution to be factual) and looking into the proof of its existence - the more I found that the theories didn't help explain anything, including the so-called evidence. I finally reached the conclusion that the world and all the things in it were too highly intricate in their forms and ways that it was simply impossible that evolution was responsible for it all. Not to mention in the light of the the mounting history that backed up in favor for that there must be someone who is really in charge for the universe and world that we live on. And one day, when I was doing an essay, I asked my biology teacher about the possibility that there may be a higher being responsible for everything and asked if it was possible to debate the idea in a constructive manner. Instead, the teacher refused to even discuss the issue and insisted that I concentrate on what the report was about and not on ""fairy tales"". When I asked her proof about it, she had nothing to back up her claims and as a result, I was failed.

Getting back to the original review - I confess I was a bit dubious about what Ben Stein would actually contribute to the documentary and if it was indeed perhaps a farce. However, I was truly surprised. I think Mr. Stein was very brave in bringing this documentary to the public fore and certainly alot of the reactions that he said would happen (who are pro-evolution) have happened - alot of it nothing but curses and people's opinions. And the rest using the same material that is shown to be questionable.

Its interesting, also, that some of those people, who are against this movie, claim that those in support of it have an agenda to tout. And yet, I wonder what reasons they have for what they have to say.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is willing to take a step back and look into both sides to find out the truth into how the world came to be.",1215648000,40,2862,4.477011494252873
3500040,1,B001BYLFFS,"Yes, I watched the movie (I sat for an interminable period of time in stunned silence at my parents' house).

Not only is it ignorant of even the most basic, fundamental tenets of modern evolutionary thought, it's ugly conflation of anti-semitism and evolution should sicken rational, even vaguely intelligent viewers.

Riefenstahl & Goebbels would have been proud to see their techniques used so blatantly in today's ""enlightened"" era.",1215475200,295,436,5.397058823529412
3500041,1,B001BYLFFS,"By trade, I am a biologist. I teach biology and invest strongly in science. ""Science"" comes from the Greek word for ""knowledge."" Those who shun science shun knowledge. Evolution is as strong a science as gravity and thermodynamics. If someone attempted to teach my children that gravity was explained by God tethering us with invisible strings, I would attempt to have them fired or, better yet, sent to the loony bin. Likewise, when people attempt to claim that we did not evolve over 3 billion years from a single celled organism, they should suffer the same fate (fired, committed, etc.). The facts are the facts, and should not be skewed by the ignorant.

So biology is my trade. But by faith, I'm a devout Christian. I speak to and have a personal relationship with God. He is omnipresent in my life. I abide strongly by the Ten Commandments - one of the most salient being ""thou shall not bear false witness."" We have come to accept this to mean, colloquially, ""you should not lie."" You should not lie to your significant other about where you have been. You should not lie to your friend about your feelings. You should not lie to your fellow humans regarding the intricate process of evolution that has crafted intelligent, dextrous humans who possess immense capability as a species.

My biological training progressed almost simultaneously with my theological training. But as I learned each, they only served to bolster each other. Learning about the richness of life that occurs here on our planet made me understand the infinite beauty of our Creator.

I must say that I did have one conflict (luckily just one) with the simultaneous understanding of science and God. When I finally ""got"" evolution, I realized, as many creationists have, that this scientific fact is incompatible with the teachings of the Bible. I went to Church and prayed for the answer, hoping I did not have to shun one of my devout endeavours to pursue the other. I heard the voice of God reverberate through my very soul. He said, ""What are you, retarded? The Bible isn't a scientific text. For questions of sciece, refer to the scientists, who have discovered the rules of my Earth through the ingenious scientific method. For instance, if you want to understand how you came to be as a species, read On the Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection (Thrift Edition). It's sublime! I wrote one book and that is all; I had to dumb it down for the early humans just to get you going as an intelligent species. Just as I planned, you evolved intelligently enough to produce science and technology. The Bible was only meant for the early, ignorant humans. Now that you've launched from your Biblical selves into an autonomous species, you can safely rely on the writings of scientists to get your answers. "" Well that settled that.

Anyway, this movie perpetuates the ignorant belief that evolution is a flimsy theory and, because of that, ""alternatives"" should be taught. But, in reality, it is the mental capacity of the film creators that is flimsy. Just because you ""don't get"" something doesn't mean it is wrong; it simply means you need to go back to school or even just pick up a book.",1215475200,288,3183,4.750452079566004
3500042,5,B001BYLFFS,"The following is from a book by Stephen C. Meyer: This review is not consecutive to the text of Mr. Meyer's book.  During the past forty years, developments in physics and cosmology have placed the word ""design"" back in the scientific vocabulary.  Beginning in the 1960s, physicists unveiled a universe apparently fine-tuned for the possibility of human life.  They discovered that the existence of life in the universe depends on a highly improbable but precise balance of physical factors.  The constants of physics, The initial conditions of the universe, and many other of its features appear delicately balanced to allow for the possibility of life.  Even slight alterations in the values of many factors, such as the expansion rate of the universe, strength of gravitational or electromagnetic attraction, or the value of Plank's constant, would render life impossible.  Physicists now refer to these factors as ""anthropic coincidences"" (because they make life possible for man) and to the fortunate convergence of all these coincidences as the ""fine tuning of the universe"".  Given the improbability of the precise ensemble of values represented by the constants, and their specificity relative to the requirements of a life-sustaining universe, many physicists have noted that the fine tuning strongly suggests design by a preexistent intelligence.  As a well-known British physicist Paul Davies has put it ""the impression of design is overwhelming.  As Sir Fred Hoyle has commented ""a commonsense interpretation of the facts suggest that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as chemistry and biology, and there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature"".  Many physicists now concur.  They would argue that, given the improbably and yet the precision of the dial settings, design seems the most plausible explanation for the anthropic fine tuning.  Indeed, it is precisely the combination of improbability (or complexity) of the settings and their specificity relative to the conditions required for a life-sustaining universe that seems to trigger the ""commonsense"" recognition of design.  Yet several other types of interpretations have been proposed: (1) the so called weak anthropic principle, which denies that the fine tuning needs explanation; (2) explanations based on natural law; and (3) explanantions based on chance.  Each of these approaches denies that the fine tuning of the universe resulted from an intelligent agent.  Using Dembski's ""explanatory filter"", this section will compare  the explanatory power of competing types  Of the three options.  It will also argue, (1), that fine tuning does not require an explanation.  Advocates of WAP claimed that if the universe were not fine tuned to allow for life, then humans would not be here to observe it.  Thus they claimed, the fine tuning requires no explanation.  Yet as John Leslie and William Craig have argued, the origen of the fine tuning does require an explanation.  Though we humans should not be surprised to be living in a universe suited for life (by definition), we ought to be surprised to learn that the conditions necessary  are so vastly improbable.  Leslie likens our situation to that of a blindfolded man who discovers that, against all odds, he has survived a firing squad of one hundred expert marksmen.  Though his continued existence is certainly consistent with the marksmen having missed, it does not explain why the marksmen did miss.  In essence, the weak anthropic principle wrongly asserts that the statement of a necessary condition of an event eliminates the need for a causal explanation of that event.  Oxygen is a nessary condition of fire, but saying so does not provide a causal explanation of the San Francisco fire.  Similarly, the fine tuning of the physical constants of the universe is a necessary condition for the existence of life, but that does not explain, or eliminate the need to explain, the origen of fine tuning.  Roger Penrose, Oxford Physicist has noted that a single parameter, the so-called ""original phase volume"" required such fine tuning that the""Creator's aim must have been precise to an accuracy of one part in 10 to the tenth power to the123 power successive '0'-more zeros than the number of elementary particles in the entire universe.  Such is, he concludes,  ""the precision needed to set the universe on its course.  Thanks be to God.

Ben Stein's attempt to link the Holocaust to Darwin is simply shameful, the disingenousness of producers whilst interviewing participants has been widely reported across the internet and everyone but the most religiously biased individuals understand that Intelligent Design is nothing more than a long line of efforts to promote Biblical creationism.

It was a scientific farce, but on top of that, it was the most bored I've ever been in a theater.

3500046,5,B001BYLFFS,"I can see by K. McKnight's review, that it has begun.

Does K. McKnight say that he has watched the DVD?  No.  Does he say that he has seen the movie?  No.

Yet, he is compelled by other people's opinions to deride this film.  That in itself should make you suspicious.  Perhaps even a bit curious.  What type of film could provoke this type of slander?

Answer: a film which calls into question the very world view that many hold sacred, the world view of scientific materialism.  For those who hold fast to this world view, nothing can question it, and no amount of evidence can overturn it.

Some people think that this movie is about Intelligent Design.  It is not about Intelligent Design.  It barely gives a definition of Intelligent Design.  The movie is about freedom.  It is about the freedom to create your own world view based upon the scientific evidence you care to pursue.

Not every scientist has been right about every hypothesis.  Not even every scientific theory has been right.  But scientists have always had the freedom to follow the evidence where ever it leads them.  And because of that many scientific paradigms have been overturned.

Until now.

In the present age, if you propose a hypothesis which challenges the materialistic status quo, your career is likely to be ended.  This movie is about scientists who have been silenced because of a hypothesis that they would like to pursue.  They have been ""expelled"" from the academy.  And now, their kin, like K. McKnight, would like to expel this movie from public awareness.

I saw the film.  I brought my family to see the film.  And I have already pre-ordered the DVD.

And if you believe in freedom of scientific exploration (whether or not the hypothesis ends up ultimately being right or wrong) then you should obtain this DVD, and join the fight against the ideological suppression of ideas that it exposes.

In a previous age, the Church was guilty of suppression of scientific freedom.  In this age, it is the Academy.  Watch this movie to find out the truth about the intellectual thought control which is taking place in our schools and universities.

The reason you will see such vile attacks on this movie is because they are dearly afraid you will learn the truth.  Don't let that happen.  Be independent enough to learn the truth for yourself.",1215043200,67,2333,4.721393034825871

The focus of this video is not so much on which view is correct, but whether there should be freedom in the scientific or academic worlds to hold and promote views of life that to some degree or another invoke a supernatural cause or divine oversight/orchestration.

While Ben Stein begins and ends in a college auditorium, the background set for this anything-but-objective video is the Berlin Wall. This metaphor is used to argue that we need to tear down the wall between science and religion. While the first half of the video is used to portray why intelligent design (ID) is not religion, the second half is used to argue that religion in the form of some Designer should be allowed a role in explaining science.

Court cases don't decide anything in science is true about science concepts. However, the video totally avoids the federal judges ruling in the Dover, Pennsylvania case that intelligent design is not science and therefore cannot be taught as science in the public school classroom. And that is because ID says that when certain phenomena cannot yet be explained, it therefore must be caused by an unnatural explanation (ID). The Dover decision called ID a science stopper and has since prevailed in bringing this argument to a halt and pretty much gutted the premise of this video. Indeed, in the seven years after this video, both ID and other forms of creationism are becoming lost arguments, with even Pat Robertson conceding that fighting evolution is losing converts among the young who recognize that there were no dinosaurs on the Ark.

Several concepts are confused in this video and need to be clarified by careful definition. First, scientism is the belief that scientific methods can be applied to all aspects of life including human behaviors. However, modern scientists rarely if ever extend their use of science beyond the natural world of chemistry, physics and biology. This leaves much room for scientists to be believers in religion. The assertion by Eugenie Scott of NCSE (now retired) that there is no conflict between evolution and many denominations is backed up by formal statements from nine of the 12 most populous denominations in support of evolution, the members of which constitute 89 percent of those top 12 denominations. Those denominations that do not support evolution are nearly all literalists who likewise believe in a young Earth, etc. Steins evidence to the contrary is like much of this testimony, unsupported by data, but illustrated heavily by cuts to out-of-context scenes in cherry-picked vintage films.

This video is heavy-laden with comparisons with Hitler, Kruschev, Stalin, Planet of the Apes, etc. at every turn ad hominem attacks in an attempt to portray scientists being persecuted by an academic complex. There are several allusions to science always keeping an open mind when science actually works by closing the doors to theories that are proven to not work. Ironically, there is a reference to ID not being in the same category as flat earth belief, but that was pretty much the conclusion of the Dover, PA judge when he ruled that it did not belong in the public school science classroom.

Darwinism is continuously used for evolution, a dead giveaway of the non-science orientation of this video since modern biologists rarely use the term. If Darwin had not been the first to describe the early processes of natural selection, Alfred Wallace would have and we would be calling it Wallaceanism. Evolution by natural selection was simply a natural process awaiting discovery, not an invention from thin air.  It is a complex natural phenomenon that would have been discovered by other scientists had these two never existed. Secondly, the many more varied and complex mechanisms of evolution by natural selection have since developed into such a useful basis for investigating biological problems and explaining otherwise unexplainable phenomena that the phrase man who say it cannot be done should not get in the way of man doing it is clearly applicable to this video. There are so many applications of evolution in modern medicine, wildlife ecology, etc. that the theme presented here is really flat earth reasoning. So no, modern science does not continue to give equal time to flat earth theory.

An impressive amount of work goes into a minute of animation on the molecular workings of DNA and a cell, which is indeed very complex. Yet the mathematical calculations that are presented here are nothing more than the mistaken watchmaker argument first laid out by Wilberforce a century and a half ago. Once a self-replicating molecular assemblage is formed, the duplication, mutation and addition of genetic material makes the assembly of more complex forms far more likely and inevitable. The simplistic discussion of the Stanley Miller experiment and its cursory dismissal is pitiful and reminds me of early creationists tracts that said that the atom was not possible because the nucleus was made of positive atoms and positive charges repel, so a nucleus would blow apart. This video is replete with primitive understanding of evolutionary science.  There is a recent compendium on Protocells released by MIT Press that shows how work to model various pathways to early cell formation is progressing on many fronts. The allusions to life coming only from aliens or elsewhere are misleading and cleverly crafted to provide reason for those with confirmation bias to remain smugly ignorant.

Most egregious is the visitation to Hitlers facilities for killing during the Third Reich, with the direct implication that belief in Darwinism was the direct cause of this atrocity. Hitlers folks also believed in Newtonian science. Like a knife, all science can be used for good or bad, which is why many modern scientists (contrary to the few that Stein has portrayed as losing their faith) are adherents of various faiths and they apply their sets of beliefs in relation to how they treat other people, something that science does not aspire to dictate. It is unfortunate that this video buys into a god of the gaps perspective where every new discovery of science must make a persons belief in god smaller. Science is limited to the biological and physical sciences.

And that is the key issue: science references the real world and to the extent its descriptions explain and predict natural phenomena, it is very successful. Science is about function, not purpose. Science is about how physics, chemistry and biology work, but not how to treat others.
Today, those advocating for compassion and peace and fighting injustice come from the evolutionary biologist community as much as from religious denominations, and that is the real insult of this video. The demonization of evolution as leading inexorably to eugenics, sterilization, euthanasia, etc. as well as the demonizing Malthusianism and Planned Parenthood reveals the dogmatic and political agenda of this pseudo-documentary.

The one minuscule truth that the video exposes is that some folks who supposedly speak for evolution are not very articulate. It is important not only to know what you mean when you say something, but also to know what listeners will understand when they hear itand craft your message for precise communication. Aside from the out-of-context interview segments and bad editing, there are also a significant number of poorly explained evolutionary concepts described by scientists who could have done better. If Stein gets and F, some of the scientists interviewed barely deserve a D.",1452643200,2,7349,5.1500419111483655

3500258,2,B001BYLFFS,"I did like this documentary at first because I thought that it was completely objective, but when I read the Wikipedia entry on it, I saw evidence to the contrary. Unfortunately, Mr. Stein used various manipulations in order to portray his point. I think no side should do that. The evolutionists nor the creationists should interview people by giving them false assumptions, cherry pick quotes and take them out of context, tell half-truths in order to demonize the opponent, not tell the entire story, etc.

Well, it seems that Mr. Stein did just that, which quite frankly, disappointed me. By the way, I am only talking about cases where it was evident that he tried to portray certain people as victims when it was in fact clear that they weren't. With that being said, I do need to stipulate that with some of these scientists, it's hard to know why they really were explained since it's the word of the scientist against the word of the given institute.

It's also sad that Mr. Stain (according to the people who were interviewed for the film) did not tell them what was the film really about. Some of the interviewed said that only sections of the interviews appeared of the film, which isn't the way to make a proper documentary.

With all that being said, there were some truths to the film. Some people in science are being persecuted for their beliefs, whether it's regarding to Global Warming/Climate Change or intelligent design.

The atmosphere, which I've seen with my own eyes, and which is described in this documentary goes beyond mere atheism and actually extends to an open hostility toward anyone who believes that God has any place whatsoever in our understanding of our world and ourselves.  Science, when it's done right, is belief based on observation and evidence.  That requires honest scientists to be open to ideas that they cannot disprove, and it requires them to acknowledge when they don't have an answer.  This documentary shows bad science in action.  It also shows some very good scientists who, sadly, go a step too far believing that an otherwise interesting and plausible theory necessarily excludes God, thus unknowingly (I hope) exercising a faith in atheism.",1447113600,2,866,5.113475177304965

3500319,5,B001BYLFFS,"Consensus is not Science. The underlying message is about academic freedom. You could easily say the same thing about scientists who say that while man is possibly affecting our climate (as opposed to weather) but suspect that such things as the Sun heating & cooling all on it's own probably has more influence on the climate are also pariahs.

It is another of ""the Emperor's new clothes"" story. When ""intelligent design"" can not even be discussed in our schools or media, it shows that true intellectual freedom is a thing of the past. True science is asking questions, and then looking for answers and following those answers wherever they may lead. When following only one path, you end up putting blinders on. Definitely eye-opening and informative! The nonsense of evolutionary ""science"" is a religion, For all the dissenters out there, they should have the freedom to follow the evidence WHEREVER it leads, even when that evidence clearly steers one away from Darwinian evolution.

The idea that molecules arrange themselves like crystals do, to create life. Only an absolute idiot could even think that way. The complexity of proteins and how they are arranged to fold in 3 dimensional shapes and to read error correcting DNA code with the precision that surpasses our greatest super computers, displays the brilliant genius that only a multidimensional being could imagine and then create, using the atoms which he also created. And which came first the protein or the DNA to design the protein, it all had to be created all at the same time. This is an excellent documentary that points out very clearly the science community's bias against Intelligent Design. It is not a negative about Darwinism; it simply clarifies that there is another theory about the origins of life on earth. Both are theories; both should be taken seriously, since both are based on the same fossil record. John Lennox notes that the debate is really not about science but it's about worldviews. If you're an opponent of ID, you'll probably hate this movie. If you believe that ID is the best explanation for the universes's fine-tuning and mechanical order, than you'll probably love this movie. However, if you're able to look beyond your own prejudices, you can't help but see that many able-minded scholars have undoubtedly been ostracized by the scientific community based on philosophical naturalism, not their scientific research records.

Ben Stein, in his own understated way, presents the argument that intelligent design is not given a fair hearing. He makes some powerful points that are hard to argue with and intersperses humor along the way",1431475200,3,2642,5.055045871559633

It is ostensible that that dry, wry and pretentious English dick Dawkins, the liar-in-chief of the Anglo-American Journalism of Science, has surrounded himself with the thickest lot of self-satisfied white parvenus known to Man, wherein resides a coterie of mad intellectual prostitutes ready to bite to defend their pimp in London. In the film, it is apparent that he is nothing more than a partisan hack, a political commissar of the Charles Darwin School of Political Biology, which along with the atheistic creed of Liberalism (and secular LIberalism too) is exercising its rights of dictatorship over the public of morons and idiots which constitute the majority of the electorate in these regions.

1) predictions of Darwinism have all failed. For one, there is no junkyard of discarded fossils [necessary for an undirected mechanical process of hit-and-miss evolution] anywhere to be found, and Darwin's Tree of Life stands refuted by fossil evidence, for there is no evidence for general progression from lower to greater complexity across the board or in isolated places.

2) the DNA evidence clearly points at the brilliant and ever changing information repositories, whose origin is unknown - but one thing about it is known: Natural Selection which the ignorant charlatan Darwin proposed reduces information and has no way of accounting for novel information. Random mutations are a shameful patch designed to serve Neo-Darwinian conjectures. That they are shameless is obvious from the fact that they needed something 'random' to exist inside a theory. A true theory in science cannot have anything random about it.

3) No science lab has ever discovered a way in which entire systems and sub-systems of organic growth and development simultaneously coordinate their chemical changes (under pressure from new information of source unknown) to allow for the construction of new bodily functions and features. For instance - just the changes necessary to make Hemoglobin or cilia in amoebas to be formed require the cooperation of many thousands upon thousands of proteins and cells which all must be adjusting at the same time for the sustenance of an organism undergoing  metamorphosis and its transformation to the next level of working systems with novel function, as Behe pointed out.

4) All organisms are fit and ready for action in the first place. They have cycles of life, ageing and death they must undergo as if driven by hidden laws of Nature.

5) The presence of artistic and altruistic elements in Nature, the orientation towards beauty in both the living and the unliving things, the sculpting action of Nature which has no accounting to do with Darwinism and its banal, vulgar and inelegant heavy hand of theorizing under the cover of alleged fact. The essential artistic element to Nature is ignored by partisans of darwinism.

6) millions of laser-sharp objections to Darwinism by the giants of Western Science who are now dead but whose legacy lives. Politcoms of Darwinism believe that what they choose to ignore must - ipso facto - be ignored by all! WRONG !",1423094400,3,3237,5.187739463601533
3500361,5,B001BYLFFS,"This is a gentle, though-provoking documentary.  Ben Stein is skeptical that in America there could be a lack of academic freedom for those who question the adequacy of Darwinian evolution to explain the origins of life.  He investigates and finds numerous examples of loss of tenure and other forms of discrimination against those who even mention the consideration of Intelligent Design.  The difference between creationism and intelligent design is explained, and academics who are not Christians are included. (Ben Stein is Jewish.) Several scientists comment on how their understanding of Darwinian evolution helped lead them to the ""freedom"" of atheism.  The links between Darwinian evolution and Planned Parenthood, eugenics, and Hitler's Final Solution are explored.  The film is shot in black and white and includes a large amount of vintage newsreel type material.

3500363,1,B001BYLFFS,"Stein immediately begins this 'documentary' with some very blatant insinuations that evolution leads to Nazism and caused the Holocaust. He continues this near the end (around the 1:19:00 mark, from memory) by quoting Charles Darwin to prove this:

According to Ben Stein, Darwin says the following, which directly led to Nazism:
""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.""

Sounds pretty damning, right?
If you look at the full quote however, the final message is quite different:
""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.
The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely the weaker and inferior members of society not marrying so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased, though this is more to be hoped for than expected, by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage.""

Even a brief examination of the 'facts' presented in this documentary will reveal them to be misleading at best and outright lies at worst. This isn't a documentary, it is a propaganda film designed to appeal to the fundamentalist right by telling them that there is a conspiracy to suppress their views.
None of the people presented in this 'documentary' were expelled for supporting (or just 'mentioning') Intelligent Design. The only person who might possibly be considered an exception to this is Caroline Crocker (who apparently was fired and blacklisted for mentioning ID in biology class). Put simply, her contract was not renewed (she definitely wasn't fired) and she repeatedly presented long-refuted arguments for creationism in class, when ID was definitely not on the course list.
I'll provide a link to the refutations of the claims made in this 'documentary', because they've all been refuted many times before and it will take too long to list them all individually. The sole purpose of this 'documentary' is to reinforce the persecution complex of the fundamentalist right.

3500365,5,B001BYLFFS,"'Expelled' stirs such deep passions that people who haven't even seen the movie are writing reviews!

Others are recommending 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' in tandem with this documentary because Ben Stein officiates in the docu and starred in the kid-opic. That's called association, a process that can sometimes speed one's thinking, and occasionally eliminate the necessity altogether, but not always.

Ben Stein has produced, narrated and acted in this documentary focusing on one of the foundational freedoms of America.

Freedom of thought is being subtly expunged from society beginning with our educational institutions.

Examples:  American universities expelling people for just considering an idea, (No surprise here.  When one's universe is not expanding, there is no room for ideas that conflict with your own personal view.)

And now Christian universities are expelling science professors for teaching ideas contrary to the theory of evolution, (Huge surprise to many. Christian knowledge, like the Universe, continues to expand at exponential rate.  Meanwhile back at the ranch, the theory of evolution continues to regress in apobetics!  Read ""Taking Back Astronomy"").

Evolution being a theory that has zero proof in the macro realm, (that's why it is called a theory,) one would think there was at least some wiggle room for discussion.

Experience 'Expelled,' and rediscover thought.  What a breath of fresh air !

Richard Sternberg and all those other people with the CSC already have the freedom to follow the evidence wherever it leads. They can do their own research. (They do.) They can hold their own conferences. (They do.) They can publish their work in their own journals. (They do.) What they cannot do is sidle up against legitimate science with the expectation that some of the luster will rub off onto them.

Sternberg and others want you to think they are being denied a voice. They are not. Their message is welcome at any number of pulpits in churches across this nation. Millions will come and listen with rapture. However, it is a mistake for these charlatans to think that serious people are going to pick up and carry their message for them or even to, in the face of all known facts, acknowledge that message has any scientific merit.

3500499,5,B001BYLFFS,"Excellent ""Intelligent Design"" documentary. It is not very heavy on expounding on ID, but gets into some of the core problems ID has. Primarily, it is striking for showing how badly any critic of evolution is treated in scientific circles. (This is the very same behavior shown in scientific circles for any sort of challenge to mainstream belief, however, though it is especially vitriolic when the opinions are deeply ""religious"" in nature. ""Religious"", as in people ""believe very strongly in it"" -- such as you see with some sports fans and some operating system fanatics.)

Stein does make a very good presentation on a remaining serious problem for evolution: how did life arise from non-life.

The main criticism on this sort of presentation is it provides reasonable doubt to a theory, which is a cardinal sin. But it is one of the serious problems of evolution. (Another argument is ""evolution does not even attempt to address this"" argument. Which has some truth to it. But pretending that argument is meaningful in any way beyond an irrelevant technicality I find to be dishonest. And so will you, especially after seeing the daunting problem facing scientists searching for this solution.)",1404259200,,1200,5.055555555555555

3500501,5,B001BYLFFS,"As documentaries go, this was probably a low-budget deal.
However, the fact that the Darwin ideology has become the new state religion, and major power-player on the block, and is acting exactly as the church did during the dark ages,  is no insignificant issue.

The testimonies of large numbers of people, especially within academia.

In George Orwells novel; Nineteen Eighty-Four, he presents a picture of  omnipresent government surveillance, manipulation of the masses, dictated by a politically powerful ideology, using a thought-reform technique, called Newspeak.  The manipulation of the many, by a privileged Inner-Party-elite that persecutes all individualism and independent thinking, labeling them ""thought-crimes"".

Orwell is strangely insightful here.  But essentially it is the same old story-line played out so many times in human history.  Where a new group of pioneers, build their fortresses and plant their flags of ownership on the territory upon which they land.  By hook or by crook, they will defend their new powerbase and use it as a platform to advance personal wealth and personal power.  Such is the case with the Darwinian power players now operating as a million dollar industry, at the tax-payers expense.  As the church of the dark-ages claimed to be the representative of the so called pure religion , the Darwinians now wear the mask of the so called pure science.

The Darwinian is now a devout member of the new, tax-payer funded, superior religion.
Hiding behind the mask of science, they are not about to lose their stronghold over ill-gained wealth and prestige.
Non-Darwinians are the new heretics who must be burned at the stake, in order to protect the true science.

3500530,5,B001BYLFFS,"Have you ever had an idea that has been brutally squashed by a teacher, just because you aren't thinking the way they think you are supposed to? If so, you may be surprised that you are not the only one made to feel that the freedom to think and discover are long dead. In a scientific classroom, shouldn't we expect to have ideas and then learn from the process of discovery--whether those ideas are right or wrong isn't the purpose to make the journey with modern scientific tools and learn how to discover an answer? Shouldn't the science education and research establishment encourage these thoughts and instead of squashing them? I would think that a concerned university head of research or college professor would direct that discovery instead of shutting it down. If you agree that freedom of discovery is important in science and/or identify with the frustration of being shut down in a science setting then this documentary is for you. Not only will you gain a greater perspective on Evolution and Intelligent Design, you will also stand up and cheer at Mr. Stein's deft ability to reveal this flaw in modern elitist science.

Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed reveals that there are larger issues involved with freedom of thought, use of the scientific method, and the ability to follow evidence wherever it leads today. Much like the time of Galileo or Copernicus, those in power don't always have the right answer in science, and the establishment of today doesn't like to be questioned or contradicted. Unlike those real champions to scientific discovery, elitist science authority today and their pseudo-scientists spokespersons like Al Gore, who claim that the 'debate has been settled' and 'a consensus has been reached,' fail to see that real science doesn't work that way. Consensus and belief by those in authority is sometimes wrong, like those who believed the world was the center of the universe/solar system in the time of Copernicus. Even with evidence Galileo had proven these heretical ideas to be true, the establishment was completely immune to reason in plain simple language because it wasn't easy for them to accept change from intellectual heretics. Expelled: No Intelligence allowed suggests a parallel between similar times of authoritarian rule and those in authority that desire to squash any opposing view instead of embracing the free exchange of ideas and pursuit of evidence wherever it might lead.

Ben Stein's humorous and revealing documentary reveals these biases with regard to the pro-Darwinist Theory of Evolution establishment and those they persecute who wish to involve the idea of Intelligent Design some discussion/research. Another premise of this outstanding documentary is that teaching students this intellectual journey of discovery using lessons from the past and the scientific method should be encouraged in order to preserve the ability to think and advance our culture through Science. Ben Stein's very funny dead pan point is clear: if we are to remain a free society, we need to preserve the freedom to think whatever we wish, even if that thought has to do with a now heretical scientific investigation and belief in an intelligent designer. Hopefully the next generation will be able to make that scientific journey toward their own belief and reap the consequences of their actions good or bad, unencumbered from the threat of punishment by someone in power who doesn't like nonconforming thought.",1394928000,,3466,5.154529307282416

3500536,1,B001BYLFFS,"Here are the claims made by the movie, and my reply to each of them:

1) ""Darwinism is not a valid theory, as it does not explain how life began."" Well, it never purported to. Evolution explains how life adapts for success in its environment; but it only begins once life is already present. It is not a theory for the origin of life, only of species.

2) ""Darwinism leads to Nazism, eugenics, and euthanasia."" True, the concept of adaptability and survival of the fittest can be twisted to support killing of those deemed ""less fit."" Physics can be used to detonate atomic weapons; or it can be used to land a man on the moon, provide power to hugely-popluated cities, or expand our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Physics is a concept, incapable of motive--because it can be put to undesirable use does not condemn the field, only the practitioners. The same with Evolution.

3) ""Darwinism leads to Atheism."" Exactly at the one-hour mark, at the emotional apex of the movie, we meet Dr Provine. He tells of being in a college class studying Evolution, and questioning where his god fit into it; and says by the end of the semester he had decided that god didn't fit, and he had no belief in god ever since. Dr Provine was never ""expelled"" from the scientific community for his beliefs; he offers no testimony about any weakness in Darwin's theories; he presents nothing but his own personal experience in ""de-conversion"" from Christianity to Atheism. That is the sole reason for his presence: to demonstrate the threat that Evolution poses to religion.

Never mind that plenty of people become Atheists without the study of Evolution; and that plenty of scientists manage to incorporate Evolution into their personal theology, with both surviving. The entire premise of this movie is nothing more than a re-hash of the church's persecution of Galileo. His ideas, too, ""threatened"" the church; that did not make them wrong. Ultimately, the church was forced to amend their stance on heliocentricity, in line with what Galileo had said.

The movie continues to say that, without religion, these legions of newly ""recruited"" Atheists will start aborting fetuses, euthanizing the weak, and acting without moral direction, because they have supplanted god's law with science. In other words, the same misunderstanding, distortion of the truth, fear-mongering, and outright lies that religion has spread about Atheism since the dawn of both.

4) ""We don't know how life began; it must have been some intelligent being."" At one time, we didn't as a species understand gravity and planetary motion; we filled that gap in our knowledge with the gods dragging the sun across the sky. We had no concept of microbial infection; we explained disease through possession by malevolent demons. It is a normal, human reaction to ignorance to assign some magical being responsibility. It is NOT part of the scientific process, however. At best, one can say that the origin of life MAY have been some outside, intelligent agent. It may also have been a completely natural function, just one that we do not yet understand. Religion has ever abhorred the concept of, ""We simply don't know.""

5) ""Intelligent Design is anathema in powerful scientific circles."" This claim is partly true, although the persecution alleged in the first half-hour of the movie is exaggerated, at best (see ExpelledExposed.com). However, espousing ID as a scientist does make your motives, and the rest of your work suspect. The reason is ID's departure from the scientific process, as described above. If ID proponents were satisfied with saying, ""We don't know; it could have been an intelligent agent,"" the rest of us would be happy to let them do so. But the true motivation of ID, as presented in Expelled, is to fill the gap in our knowledge with god. Specifically, with the Abrahamic god, the god of the Bible. And ID has a history of being co-opted as a Trojan horse by those who would sneak creationism into the public school science classroom.

I am an Atheist. I would be willing to stipulate that some intelligent, outside agent could have started the wheels of life in motion, after which Evolution began its processes of specialization and adaptation. But it is an unfounded leap from there to the assertion that anyone's personal god did it. Where, outside your own ""feelings"" and your holy book, is the evidence for this?

The bottom line is, we don't know how life began. We may not learn during any of our lifetimes. This vacuum in our body of scientific knowledge need not be--indeed, cannot be--filled with a narrow sect's concept of their supreme being. There is a long history that demonstrates the folly of doing so, and no scientific justification for it.

6) In attempting to support the above assertions, the movie exaggerates or invents the persecution of scientists who promote ID; they mistakenly assign blame to Evolution for a host of evils (as they see them); they deliberately misquote Darwin and misrepresent his views; and their editing, lighting, soundtrack, and inclusion of unrelated footage are blatant attempts to appeal to emotion in a ""documentary"" supposedly critical of those who would adulterate science.",1391904000,7,5227,4.9634285714285715

Obviously, the belief that there is a creator can not be proven scientifically. That having been said, the case for evolution leaves many questions unanswered. The jury is still out on how life began, and there is much to be discovered if we are to prove that species gradually advanced to  form new species over time.",1390953600,2,467,4.626506024096385

And boy what a trail they take him (and the viewer) on.

It's especially funny to hear some of the great proponents of evolution make seriously inane and ridiculous comments (like the notion that life had to have evolved on some other planet since it couldn't have evolved here) -- and see Stein keep a straight face while they continue to talk and hang themselves and their theory in the process.

It doesn't even make a case for intelligent design or why it should be taken seriously.  Stein just attacks evolution (though he spends more time actually attacking the scientists themselves) and makes Darwin out to be the route of Hitler's evilness.
If you believe in intelligent design and creationism you will probably like this film.  That group is typically looking to defend itself against science already, so some cheap shots should be fun for you.

The documentary draws attention to the problems inherent to Darwin's theory.  Notably, the documentary illustrates the failure of Darwin, or of any modern-day Evolutionist, to explain (let alone scientifically replicate) how the first living cell came into being.  Narrator Ben Stein asks this question over and over to a number of ""experts"" who cannot satisfactorily provide an answer.  Their possibilities for the origin of the first living cell range from crystals to aliens.  So much for science.  Meanwhile, the documentary brings together a number of scientists who have suggested that Intelligent Design is a viable alternative to Darwin's Theory and worthy of discussion.  In most cases, these scientists have struggled to get their papers published in peer-reviewed journals and some have lost tenure or their positions altogether.

Not only does this cover the obvious manipulative, even malicious efforts to protect evolution and squash intelligent design coming into the classroom, it also explains the scientific merits of Intelligent Design from a scientific perspective. Ben interviews top scientists that have drawn conclusions that work against evolution and have had the courage to stand up and express it, even if it means losing their jobs and being blackballed out of the scientific mainstream. What is most compelling though is the final interview with Richard Dawkins and that is a must see. It is amazing to me how mainstream evolution advocates will teach evolution as the answer, but then when pushed about the origins of life start talking about little green men landing on the earth and seeding it.

3500590,5,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein interviewed a number of scientists and also a neurosurgeon, all who had suffered persecution and in many cases job loss, for either suggesting that Intelligent Design (ID) might offer some answers to questions that Darwin's Origin of Species failed to provide or for publishing articles suggesting that ID be placed on the table for further scrutiny.  Darwin himself admitted that his evolutionary theory has not provided an explanation for the sudden appearance of certain animal phyla in the tree of life.  Remains unanswered by evolutionary theory.
The scientists interviewed had in most cases either published a (peer reviewed) article suggesting that ID might be worthy of consideration or the like. Several lost their positions at prestigious institutions. One whose website mentioned the possibility of Intelligent Design lost his funding and was told to payback prior research funds. The scientific community is CLOSED on the topic of Evolution. From their viewpoint, it IS THE ONLY ANSWER. Those who dare to hint otherwise are treated as pariahs.

It is the faith that a speck of dirt exploded and everything went into its position to support life on earth.  It takes just as much faith to believe in evolution, if not more, as it does to believe in Christianity.  We worship God and evolutionists worship themselves as they believe we have grown more intelligent than those that came before us, and will continue to grow greater and greater through the process of evolution.  At the end of the day, both are religions but the government chooses to endorse evolution under the guise of fact.  It is a theory.  Anyways, this film is worth watching.  At times it feels like it is a bit slow and belabors some points.

with an ax to grind, but I loved this though-provoking documentary. The
reviewer says the documentary has an agenda. Hmm, don't all
documentaries have an agenda, a point of view? I think so. That does
not bother me. Make you case, but don't get your facts wrong.

Basically, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed makes the case that not
only believers in intelligent design but those who even see the
**possibility** of an intelligent designer are ostracized and even
fired from academic and research positions.

So to be a mainstream scientist you must only look to material causes
and not to any outside designer--or you are EXPELLED. (By the way, ID
adherents are not all Christians and include Jews, agnostics, and those
who believe in aliens who seeded the planet.)

Stein discusses some of the historical adherents of evolutionism, and
points out that materialism paved the way for Nietzsche and his later
followers such as the eugenicists and the Nazis. Is this an unfair
connection? No, this is historical. It really happened this way. (Of
course this does not prove that IDers and religionists are right and
that evolutionists are wrong. And we know that evil has been done in
the name of religion just as evil has been done in the name of

3500677,5,B001BYLFFS,"Scientific inquiry is supposed to be free and open.  The facts should be allowed to speak for themselves.  Moronic scientists have bought the lie that intelligent design is about trying to teach fundamental Christianism to students.

It is not.  There are significant flaws in extrapolated Darwinian theory that even the most ardent evolutionists cannot explain.  Micro evolution can be witnessed in the lab, but macro evolution has significant and serious problems.

Intelligent design is a theory that is in its infancy, but it has plausability.

Ultimately the origin of the universe and how things came to be what we observe today is a leap of faith whether you are a deist or an evolutionist.  Why?

Cause and effect.  It takes as much or more faith to believe that everything that is came from nothing as it does to believe it comes from a causal factor.  Neither has been observed, so both are still theories.

Here's where the rubber meets the road for me.  My teenage daughter got this to show to her science teacher, whose husband is a paleontologist.  She asked the teacher if she and her husband would watch it and tell her what was wrong with the video and/or what they disagreed with.

Both of them refused to watch it, saying it was a bunch of religious nonsense.

3500679,5,B001BYLFFS,"Bravo Ben Stein, Bravo. Finally someone has taken the initiative to ask the unpopular questions and has decided to think for himself. Further more atheists will hate this documentary because it presents some very serious questions that atheists would rather sweep under the carpet and ignore. But then isn't that what atheists are so good at? Being ignorant? This film is likely to be thought of as one of atheism's worst enemies because it brings to light some very obvious flaws in the belief in Darwinism and all that pertains to ignoring very strong evidence of an intelligent designer in the universe. I remember from the time I was a very young child, far before I had any concept of religion, I was taught that man evolved from apes. It seemed like a stupid theory then and it still seems like a stupid theory now. Did a house cat evolve from a cougar? Are they not a different species from the same family? is that not the case for different species? Did a barracuda evolve into or out of a shark? Humans are simply another species of mammal. Apes are a different species from us. Closer to human than monkey's. And then God decided to create what is known as the homosapien. ""Apes were a good idea, but these human's are a little bit more what I was thinking of"" sayeth the lord. The more you explore Darwinism and uncover it's obvious shallowness and constant flaws, it's amazing that anyone takes the theory seriously. The thing about this film that captivated me most of all is that now I have a name to put to what I have firmly accepted as a very important belief system. Creative design, two words that are dirty words for the common atheist because it challenges their narrow point of view and presents questions that cannot be ignored. Questions that if considered seriously render atheism to be nothing more than a fairy tale even less believable than the idea of a man with a white beard in the sky. And if truth be told Darwinism and atheism require far more faith to actually believe than simply believing in the existence of a creator. I am greatful there are some people who realize how utterly stupid the idea of atheism and Darwinism really are. But to know we live in a world where the idea of any creator is squashed by the government and scientific communities shows how truly sorry and inept the human race can truly be, especially when they actually choose to believe theories as shallow and preposterous as the idea that this all got here without any intelligence to bring it into being.

3500699,5,B001BYLFFS,"This movie was very well done and it should be stated that there is a very real and concerted effort on the part of dogmatic ""Believers"" in Evolution to suppress the other side of the coin when it comes to all of the actual evidences for Intelligent Design. No matter what any proponent of Evolution may say, they have a fundamental presupposition wherein they believe that Evolution is true and then they make their various attempts to 'fit' all of the 'evidence' into their pre-conceived worldview. I am not saying that Creationists do not have their own presuppositions wherein they accept the worldview of an Intelligent Designer and attempt to explain all of the 'evidence' in light of their worldview since we ALL have our presuppositions, but at least those who would honestly follow the evidence wherever it leads and allow anyone to ask ANY question in their search for truth have a more open mind than those who would censor, suppress and even persecute those who are asking logical and legitimate questions in their quest for answers. The issue of whether or not there is evidence for Intelligent Design should be a question that is both allowed and discussed openly not dismissed and/or ridiculed by those who hold a different opinion. The fact of the matter is that NO ONE KNOWS with certainty either way because no one was there at the beginning of everything who can provide an eyewitness account of the beginning, unless you believe in the God who created everything and provides His Own first hand witness to the events recorded in His Word, the Bible. He is the ONLY ONE Who could possibly declare the actual facts regarding the beginning of everything that exists. And if He does not really exist, then NO ONE CAN KNOW ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF EVERYTHING. This is the plain and logical conclusion and it is absolutely inescapable.

3500700,1,B001BYLFFS,"The first person interviewed in this film, Richard Sternberg, specifically says he is not an advocate of intelligent design but just a scientist who, in 2004, thought all voices should be heard when as editor of a science journal he published a paper on intelligent design, which led to his quickly being fired from his editor position, and from his research position at the Smithsonian.

 I thought this surprising and thought if I looked this man up on the internet and found he lied, and WAS an advocate of intelligent design, it would discredit the whole movie because it would show intent to deceive. What I found was much more surprising. Not only does Richard Sternberg's own website advocate intelligent design (""as broadly defined"" he says under ""My approach to to the study of Biology""), and not only is he a member of the intelligent design organization ""International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design"", and not only did he work with a creationist group in 2001 studying how to classify animals according to the bible, but the Smithsonian says he was never their employee, but merely a volunteer, and they did not fire him.  The journal also says his position with them was as a volunteer and they never fired him, though they would have liked to. They say he sneaked the intelligent design paper in without going through the normal peer review process (no other member of the journal read it) and turned in his resignation before they ever saw the paper.

 While representing that Richard Sternberg's career was ""almost ruined"" by his treatment by scientists, the makers of the film never told you that his day job was actually at the NIH, and he was still working there.

 The film makers said in the film they couldn't tell you what the Smithsonian or the science journal said because they wouldn't be interviewed. I easily found what they said in print in articles predating this film by years.

 The exaggeration and deceit was like this with everybody they interviewed. And the lies get worse and more crafted.

 The film quotes Charles Darwin as saying something that appears to mean he believes we should not take care of needy people because it would be bad for genetics. I knew right away Charles Darwin did not say this, as he famously was a humanitarian who did not like people using his theories to back cruel social policies. I thought the quote must have been taken out of context and he was probably saying the opposite.

 Again I was surprised. Wikipedia had the whole quote, and yes it was out of context, and yes, if they had quoted the entire passage he actually says we ""must"" take care of the weak and to not do so would be ""evil"", but the surprise was the film makers had gone one step further than quoting sentences out of context, and had actually removed words from within the sentences to clarify the false meaning they wanted you to get.

Rebuking the concept of Intelligent Design is their foundation. Fortunately, their most popular tools, science and engineering, are fast eroding many of Darwin's concepts of Evolution.  I recommend the Intelligent Design Collection DVD series (Darwin's Dilemma, Unlocking the Mystery of Life, and The Privileged Planet) available here on Amazon.
Undeniable facts in innumerable fossil records, modern cell biology, principles of modern engineering & design, past & current animal kingdom Phyla, Darwin's own words, the Cambrian Explosion, The Bible, numerous facts, etc., will cut down the evolutionary tree... The only truth and people left standing will be God's words and His believers.
A nice interpretation of Genesis, in pure scientific and physical explanation, can be found in the movie The Genesis Code, also available here on Amazon! Yes, the world was created by God in 6 days of cosmic time... and His Word & followers shall prevail!

3500729,5,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein has done his homework.  And Ben Stein has found a critical point that makes me shutter for our future.  I just have to say (and I have seen this throughout history and from numerous cultures): ""Whenever politics becomes the underlying agenda, no facts (regardless of what they are) will EVER matter!""  Why? Because the honest quest for truth is no longer the true agenda.  ""Political correctness"" is always intollerant of competition because it hurts the true overriding agenda (which is a political agenda--not the honest quest for truth). If there is political agenda, then credibility is lost. Arguments can be seen through for what they are: disingenuous. You see this all the time in political rhetoric. How can you recognize when politics (rather than truth) has become the supreme agenda.  Here are some distinguishing characterists which indicate that politics (rather than honest quest for truth) has become the supreme agenda:  (1) ""Political correctness"" will automatically dismiss anything politically incorrect ""out of hand."" (2) There is intollerance of respectful civil discourse of logic and reason.  (3) Logic and reason are replaced with ""ad hominem"" attacks against the character of the opponents.  (4) Logic and reason are replaced by ""emotional appeals"" (especially the appeal to anger) which distracts people from logic.  (5)Logic and reason are replaced with ""social denigration"" for the purpose of making society suppress, shun and shame those who are ""politically incorrect"" and to put ""social fear"" into the hearts of those who might otherwise be open to logic.  William Shirer (on site correspondent from NAZI Germany) wrote in THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH, ""It was surprising and sometimes consternating to find that notwithstanding the opportunities I had to learn the facts and despite one's inherent distrust of what one learned from Nazi sources, a steady diet over the years of falsifications and distortions made a certain impression on one's mind and often misled it.  No one who has not lived for years in a totalitarian land can possibly conceive how difficult it is to escape the dread consequences of a regime's calculated and incessant propaganda.  Often in a German home or office . . . or sometimes in a casual conversation with a stranger in a restaurant . . . I would meet with the most outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons.  It was obvious that they were parroting some piece of nonsense they had heard on the radio or read in the newspaper.  Sometimes  one was tempted to say as much, but on such occasions one was met with such a stare of incredulity, such a shock of silence, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty....""

I think it is obvious that (in the name of change) America is trending toward the exact opposite of what it once was.  Freedom of speach is our last hope.",1359244800,3,2983,5.040733197556008

We can't do that in America (not without being black listed)?  Wow, pretty sad.  This movie is about freedom and we are losing that at a rapid pace.

However... the question of is there a god, how did life start or how did the universe start cannot be answered by any scientist or religious person with any verifiable certainty today.

I give this movie 5 stars for 3 reasons. (most of the movie I find extremely contrived and slanted (you can connect anything to the Nazi or Commie, just ask Glen Beck).)

Reason 1 - Freedom of speech should go to scientific study and he has shown that it does not.
Reason 2 - It explains the difference between Intelligent Design and Creationism.  (One is a theory, one is religion)
Reason 3, THE biggie - He left in the statement from Richard Dawkins - ""That higher intelligence itself would have had to come about by some explicable or ultimately explicable process, it couldn't have just jumped into existence spontaneously, that is the point.""

If our insitutions look only at one side of an equation they will not come forth with an accurate and non-biased result.  Science is to examine a situation and develop an answer from the findings, not look to a result they wish to prove!  Evolution is still a theory as much as some would like to say it is a fact.  There still is no imperical evidence to support the theory of evolution.  The documentary ""Expelled"" merely shows the bias institutions of higher learning have toward anyone questioning evolution.

3500790,1,B001BYLFFS,"The Ninth Commandment certainly wasn't held in high esteem by the filmmakers (although they might attempt to weasel out of it by arguing that it only applies to witnesses held under oath in court). A thorough refutation would take several hundred pages and several years of biological education. As I specialised in business management and marketing in college, I will address the most egregious errors in the movie.

The lies and misrepresentations about what actually happened to the academics mentioned and interviewed in this ""documentary"" are already well-documented by Expelled Exposed, so I will not address them here. Suffice it to say that creationism isn't science and has no basis in academic journals until they can bring forth the evidence. So far, they have yet to do so.

The complexity of the cell - this is a red herring, and has nothing to do with evolution. It is more of an attack on abiogenesis (which we now know is possible). It certainly wasn't as simple as ""lighting striking a mud puddle."" The original cells that came into existence from self-replicating molecules and protobionts would have been much simpler than cells that comprise living beings that are the result of billions of years of evolution. Moving on.

""Science leads you to killing people."" Get real, Ben Stein. Science is a process for learning about the world. It has produced innumerable benefits for humanity (and non-human animals as well). A short list would include:

- Smallpox eradication
- Measles vaccines
- Annual influenza vaccines
- DNA sequencing
- Exponentially higher harvests worldwide
- Contraception
- Safe childbirth and elective abortions
- Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (and soon, nanotherapy) cancer treatments
- Computers
- Calculators
- Social networking
- Skyscrapers
- Antidepressants
- Plastic
- Cardboard
- The Internet
- Radio
- Television

If Stein and his shills really believed in their nonsense, why don't they join the anti-vaccine movement? Is it because they see the consequences of dead children who were denied medical treatment from their parents? Vaccines need to evolve as diseases evolve.

As for his claim that ""love of god and compassion leads you to a glorious place."" He attempts to conflate Darwinian evolution with social Darwinism. ""There would have been no Holocaust without Darwinism."" A proper understanding of evolution would lead people to understand that mutual co-operation, rather than selfishness and genocide, leads people to a happier and more prosperous society. Stein doesn't know what he's talking about. He's far out of his depth on this issue.

Religion leads to scientific suppression, and does not have any methods or structures available for learning more about the universe. And before anyone trots out the nonsense about ""the bible isn't meant to be a science book"", why would the bible include ""cures"" for leprosy? Christians can't have it both ways.

Evolution has been observed in laboratory conditions. Fruit fly speciation and bacteria evolving to consume nylon prove this (see Michael Shermer's Why Darwin Matters). This is a propaganda piece filled with lies to promote the Creationist agenda. They won't be satisfied until Creationism has shoved evolution to the back of the bus, so to speak.

I have watched this film first in the theaters, then on this DVD several times and each has revealed new information and understanding from incredibly smart ID scientists.

Anyone who thinks Ben Stein is exaggerating about the current climate of scientific inquiry should read about what recently happened this year when the world reknown neurosurgeon Ben Carson was invited to give the commencement speech at Emory University.  There was a huge uproar from the biology department about the invitation (even before Dr. Carson set foot on campus) simply because he does not believe in evolution.

The highlight of the film for me was when Ben Stein pushed Dawkins to give his theory for the origin of life.  I could not believe he actually said aliens.  Also, another interview that was memorable was with a scientist who said that he prefers religion to keep quiet, stay benign like group of knitters, stop asking questions.

3500826,5,B001BYLFFS,"TO NONBELIEVERS AND OTHERS WHO ""ARE"" INTERESTED IN THIS MOVIE.
This movie is on target. I have been cutting out newspaper articles about educators/professors who have been fired or let go because they found, in their field, that evolution does not work. I have a nice collection.
Maybe nonbelievers can explain how a four digit code like DNA (FYI we currently use two Digits in computers, 0's and 1's) was created by Mother Nature (good luck) or the first cell. If you have ever done any computer programming you would know that randomly it's not possible, only by intelligence. There is a better chance a lightening striking a Junk yard and a 747 airplane is created randomly from heat and all. Believe in that? If you do, good luck with that.
Plus, none of the ""Icons of evolution"" stand reason anyway. Darwin's ""embryo theory"" has been disproved since the invention of elect-microscopes. And the others are just as false. Look into it. Plus, have nonbelievers been paying attention to current events, ""Man is as old as Coal"", in Pennsylvania, in a coal vain they have found a human skull that is around 300 million years old (look it up on the internet, or fall 2008 newspapers). So much for your monkey tree, people have been lied to all these years.
And lastly, logically, a world without god makes no sense. It would be to live and die without purpose or reason. There is no ""good or evil"". We should just pleasure ourselves because all we have is this short life, and then there is nothing. Why follow rules, there are no consequences.
On your dying bed you will have only one hope, that god exists, you will see. Where are you going to be in a 120 years? Without hope, nowhere is the place. There are no atheists in the foxhole.
For myself, I have personal proof that god exists. It was certain events during and after my grandmother's death and also my birth and childhood. She, my grandmother, was the kindest and most gentle person I have ever known. I won't bore you with my story because it wouldn't change your mind anyway. ""Jesus"" with miracles could not change skeptic's minds, so what chance do I have!
The truth is elusive. Finding it in this life is not easy. Everybody has their own. To see truth in this world it takes wisdom and to acquire wisdom is not easy. You may be educated but that does not make you smart. Some people can read others like an open book and have very little education. They have some degree of wisdom. Life experience builds some wisdom but real wisdom comes from God, just look at the Saints (read - St. Thomas Aquinas books) the last two thousand years. Some people never learn wisdom from life or from God because there are not open minded and walk thru life with blind folds.
So, be careful in what you believe in. Mankind is good at lying. You will never get the complete truth but some persons own truth. Everybody have their own agenda, they're motivated by their own values (goodness/greed/money/love/power, etc.) Just be wise, because the smartest man maybe the biggest fool of all.

Ask yourself this question,"" AM I ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT, OR THE SIDE OF DARKNESS, WHO DO I WORK FOR IN MY QUEST TO BRING PEOPLE TO FOLLOW MY WAYS"". Warning!!! If you cause JUST ONE SOUL to turn from GOD and be damned to Hell, you will be judged more severe than if you killed numerous people with a weapon. Hence, when you killed people using a weapon etc., you did not harm their soul, only their body. You will be judged for the misery you inflicted and the life you toke (which was not yours to take).
In conclusion, ""be careful in what you say and write"", because the loss of a single SOUL is more precious to GOD and weigh more heavily on you DURING YOUR JUDGMENT then all the miseries you inflicted on your neighbor in your entire life.

It exposes the real truth, that most of the head educators are in fact anti-Christian and it is they who define what ""science"" is and anyone who questions Darwinism in our school system, even if there is evidence to show otherwise, is ostracized and fired.  In our elementary schools to our colleges, Darwinism is taught as a fact instead of a theory.  Even by Darwin's own written standards that he said would disprove his theory, those two standards in his theory are unpublished in today's text book and therefore unknown to most.  Darwin's theory (now just called evolution to disassociate the word ""theory"" from it)is taught as fast.  Even the world head of Science in England says without question that he would believe in ""spontaneous generation"" (a theory that things like worms came from hair as an example) before he would even think of considering creation or intelligent design, regardless of any possibility of it being fact.  Even the top mathematicians laugh at the theory because the chances of it happening are so astronomically against it.  Yet, those mathematicians are ignored even when math just does not lie.  Folks, it's on the vid at the end!  Ben also points out the ugly history of how Darwin's theory played a role in Hitler's reign.  It was used to justify the killing of the mentally ill, the mentally retarded, homosexuals, and the ""inferior"" races.  This same belief system was adopted by the founder of Planned Parenthood.  It is this organizations founding basses that devalues life by disguising its agenda as prochoice and that an un-born child is just a bunch of cells.

Among the examples used in the film are Richard Sternberg (an unpaid intern at the Smithsonian, not an employee, and a paid employee at the NIH) who had given notice of his resignation to the Smithsonian six months before the article that caused him to be ""terrorized"" was published.  His employment at the NIH continued unchanged.  So his claims that his life was ""nearly ruined"" are really based on him having nothing really happen to him at all.

Guillermo Gonzalez was denied tenure at Iowa State.  The film attributes this to Gonzalez's support of ID.  According to ISU, Gonzalez was denied tenure based on a review of his publications, his success in attracting research funding, the graduate students he had supervices, and his overall future promise in the field.  This looks only at his work at ISU, not before.  Unfortunately for Gonzalez, his publications appear to be restatements of prior work and that his original research slowed down considerably.  Also, the department that Gonzalez was looking for tenure in had a history of rejecting candidates at a much higher level than the university as a whole, something that the film clearly ignored since they only examined university-wide tenure stats.  His work bringing in research also paled in comparison to the average tendured faculty in his department at ISU as analyzed by scientists examing his claims of mistreatment.

You could go on in this way for all of the ""expelled"" subjects.

However, as it begins to talk about why intelligent design has been excluded from the academy, it fails to make any kind of case for why I.D. has any scientific validity.  The best it can do is suggest that since evolutionary biologists cannot explain the origin of life with absolute certainty, intelligent design becomes the only possible explanation.  That doesn't strike me as persuasive evidence.
  About 2/3's of the way through the film, it takes a nasty turn strongly suggesting that Darwinian logic led to the Nazi Holocaust during WWII.  The fact that political leaders incorrectly took biological ideas and tried to turn them into social concepts doesn't mean that the ideas from biology fail to accurately describe how living organisms have evolved.

c) All writings that ridicule, belittle or besmirch the Christian religion and its institution, faith in God, or other things that are holy to the healthy sentiments of the Volk.""

In a nutshell, The nazi's exterminated the Jews over an imaginary friend, certainly not Darwin. There is tons and tons of evidence that the Nazi's were doing Gods work (as noted by other reviewers, the Nazi's had 'God be with us' on their belts. To continue, the Nazi's persecuted even Atheists (German Freethinkers League leader, Max Sievers, was executed by the Nazis).

Hitler made this comment regarding Sparta and Eugenics based systemically cleaning of the weak:

""Sparta must be regarded as the first Vlkisch State. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of birth control or through abortions, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses"" (Hitler's Secret Book, p17). Looks like that Hitler admired this approach, and this (Sparta) was centuries before Darwin.

Furthermore, Stein says the following in the movie about intelligent design (in a nutshell): ""ID is suppressed in a systematic and ruthless fashion""

First of all, science doesn't have any notion about the supernatural. It doesn't exist god/gods/ID because simply put, They do NOT meet the basic scientific method of being testable. While there are things in the Universe humans can't understand, filling in a 'god' to make up for things that can't be explained is simply intellectually dishonest and doesn't promote humans to learn more about the world around them / the universe.

Richard Dawkins even mentioned that he was lied to about the purpose of this 'movie', so that goes to show you what lengths pro-ID crowd will go to try and smear science.

While I agree that comparative religion should be apart of the school curriculum, it should certainly not be apart of the science curriculum. ID is just another word for 'Yahweh did it' ..",1332806400,12,3027,5.376321353065539

But I wanted to read about what was new in defense of Darwinism. Surprisingly, the book almost did not bring anything new. The same examples I already knew: the moths, the comparative anatomy of the arms, Archaeopterix, etc ...The book was better in the introduction: Ruse admitted that they were no longer the funamentalists Christians who questioned Darwinism, but well-educated scientists. Watching the video and seeing the response of Ruse on the appearance of life, to me, is priceless! On the backs of the crystals! And this is science! A well-founded theory!

3500869,3,B001BYLFFS,"I appreciated the overall non-bias approach to the topic. Yet, having seen the work of the Scientists who speak ""For Creation"" I would have liked these Scientists to have been given the opportunity to make a thorough defense. They have an extremely strong and logical argument, as opposed to those in support of ""Evolution."" The contrast of the two opposing arguments would have made it very clear that ""Creation"" is the Scientific answer to life's origin. Moreover,the background music did not enhance the program, but rather detracted from the dignity of the content. The music could have been either eliminated or at least toned down to a whisper. The entire movie is dialogue,thus is not benefited by having to compete with a noisy background. The music was not worthy of the topic being discussed. Can there be a more important question that the origin of all things and their purposes. Hence, would I recommend this video? Reluctantly. If done in the same format as ""The Privileged Plant"", ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"" or ""Darwin's Dilemma""  I would recommend it in a heartbeat. These documentaries permitted the evidences to speak for themselves. The ""Theory of Evolution"" although presented as fact, is nothing more than that...a Theory! Moreover, one that lacks real Scientific basis. Many of non-creation Scientists so-called discoveries to support an evolutionary link have proved to be man made hoaxes! Where is the abundance of Macro-Evolutionary links to support their claims? Yet,the point of the documentary was to highlight how the Science community has blacklisted any who speak in favor of creation. I think this point was introduced, but could be expanded upon. Obviously, issues of ""funding"" and ""position"" are barriers to the truth being exposed. Moreover, to admit there is a designer introduces the topic of ""accountability."" If,as the Bible teaches, man was designed as caretakers of God's creation we have much to be accountable for.

We need to Open our minds and quit functionally burning people at the stake and look for an answer to the question not a question that fits an answer. Time to be ""big scientists"" now, we  have had a hundred years to prove ""the earth is flat"", lets put the 1800's behind us and figure it out. Maybe there is more than just Darwin to show changes through time...photochromic materials were discovered by an observant janitor at DOW chemical (Dow / Corning )disposing of post-utilized solutions in a dumpster; implantable plastics began with PM-MA, (poly methyl methacrolate) made by the Ford motor Corporation. It was utilized in fighter plane canopies in WWII; when pieces became embedded in pilot's bodies, there was no reaction, ergo all the implantable plastics to date. It is also utilized for the center ""plastic"" layer of laminated windshields of 99% of cars (CR-39) that holds windshields together in the event of breakage, preventing large sharp shards of glass causing enormous injuries, as well blocks `80% of uv radiation bombarding the body with its devestating affects.

3500897,1,B001BYLFFS,"This is a ridiculously slanted documentary.  It presents the message that Darwin and the theory of evolution are ultimately responsible for the holocaust, while it also promotes the teaching of creationism in science classes as an alternative ""theory.""  I placed theory in quotes there because as usual in this instance creationists are misusing the word.  A theory is an explanation or model based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning, especially one that has been tested and confirmed as a general principle helping to explain and predict natural phenomena.  It is based on careful and rational examination of the facts. It has survived the test of peer review.  Since Darwin wrote the Origin of Species 150 years ago many modern sciences have since supported the theory of evolution: biochemistry, biogeography, developmental biology, comparative anatomy, microbiology, genetics, to name a few.

 Creationism on the other hand is NOT a theory.  It is not based on facts or rationality.  It has never been presented for peer review.  That is mainly because it has nothing to test.  Creationist have yet to present even single plausible hypothesis.  They try their best to poke holes in the theory of evolution with half baked ideas like ""irreducible complexity of organisms"" and their ideas are rationally disproved every time. This is why creationism has no business being taught in a science class, Ben.  It's not science.  Teaching it in public schools is a violation of our constitutional rights.  The right to freedom of religion also means freedom ""from"" religion.  Stein is not only oblivious of the basic fundamentals of scientific theory but he is blissfully unaware of the religious bigotry involved in forcing creationism into the school system.  Our world is host to many religions, all of which have their own creation myths.  Ben Stein tries to cast the Theory of Evolution as fascism while ironically ignoring the fascism shown by creationists taking their dogma and imposing it on all of us as a universal truth.  Their level of arrogance and ignorance is astounding.  But Stein  paints the creationist as victims who are not allowed to debate their ""side of the issue""  There are no sides, Ben.  There is nothing to debate if you have no scientific theory to present and creationism doesn't.

 Belief in God, the divinity of Jesus, etc is all a matter of faith.  They are beliefs.  Evolution is a matter of fact.  You don't have to believe in it any more than you need to believe in the air you breath or the gravity that keeps you from falling off of the Earth.  As a theory it is open to further refinement like any scientific theory.  Even the theory of gravity has fine points that it doesn't explain.  For example the two Pioneer spacecraft are slowing down in a way we can't explain.  We have observed stars in the outlying parts of galaxies that move faster than current gravitational theory says they should.  But we don't throw out the entire theory of gravity because its fundamentals are still well founded and tested.  Just like the theory of evolution.

 Stein tries to demonize the theory of evolution by implying that it is responsible for eugenics and ultimately the holocaust.  The theory does one thing - explain the vast diversity of life in the world.  That's it.  There have been people since Darwin who have used the theory to promote their own agendas and they often twist the meaning of the theory.  The worst was obviously Hitler.  He believed in the superiority of his Aryan master race, based on no scientific reasoning at all.  He believed in doing away with inferior races and that Aryans should keep their genetic lines pure.  This runs contrary to everything evolution says about the survival of a species.  A species only survives if it has a diverse genetic foundation.  It needs all types of shapes and sizes within a single species, because you never know what pressures the environment is going to impose on it.  If you get rid of all the ethnicities that bigotry deems unworthy until only a limited number of genes exist in the human race, then humans as a species would inevitably die out.  Hitler and eugenics proponents pervert the very fundamentals of evolution to promote their agendas.  Stein is guilty of a common fallacy of reasoning.  He claims a thing - in this case evolution - is bad if someone unpopular - in this case notoriously evil - supports that thing.  By the way Stein never mentions that in Mein Kampf Hitler also goes to lengths to manipulate the ideas of young Earth Creationism and Christianity to further his own sick cause.  Ben surreptitiously leaves that information out.  There will always be people willing to abuse or twist any object, idea, or theory to serve their own ends, but that has never been a justification for condemning the subject of their attention.  Darwin is no more responsible for the holocaust than the Wright brothers are responsible for 9/11.",1327190400,8,4961,4.900240384615385

3500899,5,B001BYLFFS,"This documentary is a much needed portrait of the ugly situation of academia in the USA and of the dark past of Darwinism as their logic conclusions have been applied in History (eugenics, Nazi ideology). I was well acquainted with both topics prior to the movie and I can say Ben and his team did a terrific job of scholarship and journalism.

Ben starts the movie with a skeptical attitude akin to a regular person with a passing knowledge of evolution and with good-faith in scientific institutions. He interviews a scientist with impeccable credentials who lost his job for no clear reason - other than having mentioned I.D. as a valid pursuit on a peer-reviewed article.

From there, you have exclusive interviews with important people in the debate, from atheist celebrity Dawkins (who comes across as a vain charlatan)and other status-quo Darwinists to leading scientists - in the USA and abroad - who propose giving I.D. a fair chance of scrutiny. Knowing more of the ""actors"" in this drama is worth the price of admission - you might end up learnig more about our men and women of science that you expected (and they would have liked you to know).

As Ben travels America and the world and talks to various respected scientists, ugly truths starts to become clear:

(1) there is dogmatic repression of and retaliation on scientists who entertain ideas outside the orthodox Darwinian mode.

(2) The pressure and reviling of the ""rebel"" scientists involves the inquisition of the religious beliefs and political affiliation. mocking the claims that science in practice is a disinterested search for the Truth.

(3) Many renowned scientists, from Biology, cosmology, physics and other fields with great insight in natural systems are far from convinced of Darwinism's explanatory powers.

(4) Belief in Darwinism is not necessary for the practice of high-tech genetics or medicine. In fact, Darwin had absolutely no idea of genetics or the complexity of the cell when he proposed his theory.

(5) The Darwinian clique in academia is comprised mostly of radical atheist and anti-religious types, with their own agenda for increasing control over society. You will hear this from their own testimony in this show.

(6) Darwinism has been the clear inspiration for the most depraved social and political practices of recent times, such as eugenics and Nazism. The movie includes emotional visits to genocide and ""euthanasia"" facilities of the Nazi (potentially disturbing). It also includes speeches from Hitler himself and disturbing eugenic ideas here from the USA.

All in all, this is an engaging documentary for adults and mature high-school students (parents use your discretion) about a scientific theory that has had great repercussions in History for more than a century. Regardless of its merits, Darwinism has been the main justification for atheism in History - and for this reason alone it is of great interest to understand our society. It is the only 19th century ""secular prophecy"" - think of Marx and Freud - left standing, exactly because it is so staunchely protected by the science establishment.

A lost opportunity was displaying the high-profile frauds that were once hailed by the Darwin lobby as the most compelling proofs of their theory, such as the Piltdown Man (sophomoric fraud that remained uncontested for 40(!) years), the embryonic similarity among vertebrates (doctored pictures) and the mottled moths in Britan.

The temptation from either side is to turn this into a rant about how idiotic the other side is. But those sort of rants do not make for helpful reviews.

In my opinion, the film was entertaining. And how could it not be, with the understated Ben Stein at the helm? He adds a little bit of humor to a subject in sore need of it. And his strategy of depending heavily on the words of the very people he disagrees with is always an effective technique for advocacy documentaries. That said, many documentaries are unfair to their interviewees by selectively cutting and pasting the dialog so that words are taken out of context and put in the worst light. Ben may have done a bit of this, but my impression overall was that he gave everyone ample camera time to present their views. Especially compelling was the segment where Richard Dawkins brings up the space aliens. If you read Dawkins' works, you will find that his words were not taken out of context at all. Not that he currently believes in space aliens, but that he is willing to be open to the idea that our world was intelligently designed by them.

The negative for me was the Hitler thing. While it's true that certain connections can be made between Darwinism and the Nazi movement, I felt that Stein was too sensationalistic and that he did not present a very compelling case. He is correct that the Darwinian worldview has inspired great cruelties throughout history; but it is also true that one can believe in Darwinism and not be logically forced to embrace social Darwinism, eugenics and the like. Of course, for the consistent atheist, all morality is ultimately a social construct, and so any action is ultimately neither good nor bad. But there are so many other factors to consider, and I think it is painfully obvious to the viewer that Stein is stretching the truth. He gives the impression that Darwin leads directly to the holocaust, when the truth is a bit more muddled. Then again, the ""New Atheists"" show even less nuance when they blame all the world's problems on religion.",1321833600,11,2204,4.7072538860103625

3500937,5,B001BYLFFS,"If you want some more 'fun'/laughing, go read some of the IMDB reviews, its mainly filled with comments from people who would be out on the streets with their signs trying to ban the movie.

This wasn't the greatest movie on the subject in terms of substance but it was definitely a production worthy of at least 3 stars, personally I would have rated it a four on here but decided it warrants a bonus point to make up for undeserved 1stars.

It had some very funny scenes which I'm sure are what fueled many of the 1stars, simply because it deftly exposes the truth that atheistic scientists secretly have nothing against ""Intelligent Design"" as long as it does not involve God as the creator. Quoting Richard Dawkins: ""And I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of biochemistry, molecular biology, you might find a signature of some sort of designer."" --Richard Dawkins

Richard Dawkins believes that if you look at biology you may find a signature of a DESIGNER! The reason they have fought so hard to DENY the possibility of a DESIGNER and therefore ""Intelligent Design"" is because they have not been able to easily disqualify GOD from such a position in favor of just some advanced ALIENS from other planets. Watch the movie, you'll definitely enjoy the back and forth with Richard Dawkins.

This reminds me of the time when so many atheist Evolutionary Biologists, suddenly attacked their own Stephen J. Gould when he came up with his punctuated equilibrium theory because they thought it gave ""ammunition"" to their sworn enemies, the Christians.

Ben Stein did a great job interviewing various people and the movie editing was professional and engaging. That being said, I think Ben Stein's 'motive' for doing this movie had nothing to do with any real hunger for the meaning of life, the point was to simply show how great efforts are made to suppress ""Intelligent Design"" proponents. (This is why its low on any real substance in terms of a debate between atheism and religion.)",1320969600,10,2037,4.7920227920227925
3500938,1,B001BYLFFS,"If only I could have given it negative stars.

This movie starts out with interviews of people who were supposedly discriminated against in academia because of their connection to intelligent design.  I'm sure they think they were discriminated against, but Stein doesn't tell the entire story (a quick look at the Wikipedia page will set things straight).  The Smithsonian guy failed to follow peer-review procedures before publishing that article.  The next woman was only an adjunct and her contract ran out (happens all the time in academia).  The next guy didn't get tenure, but apparently he didn't have a good enough research record and didn't secure enough funding - other people at that institution didn't get tenure either, and they weren't connected to ID.  Again, happens all the time in academia.  I am an academic, and I have friends who have had their contracts run out as adjuncts and who have not made tenure because of a lack of funding - and none of them were associated in any way with ID.

The second section is all about the reluctance of ""science"" to entertain skepticism of Darwinism.  Now I am not a biologist, but I am a Ph. D. scientist, and in my experience it is ok to question any theory or hypothesis, so long as you are using the scientific method to do it.

The main problem is that intelligent design is inherently un-scientific.  Science is founded upon the scientific method - that you can only study (scientifically) that which you can concretely test.  That there is complexity in the world doesn't point to anything other than that we don't understand everything about the universe.  Could there be intelligent design?  Sure.  But there is literally no way to concretely test intelligent design (and none is put forth in the movie), therefore it is not capable of being a scientific theory.  For better or for worse.  And I'm not sure why its proponents would want it to be considered science anyway.

Initially I thought that this was the point of the movie - to convince people that ID should be considered scientific, and presented as a viable alternative to actual scientific theories.  But the second half of the movie degenerates more and more into a blatant anti-science tirade.  Stein interviews two people who claim that Darwin's theory made them lose their belief in God, then generalizes to say that it was a story they heard a lot.  Hyping up fears that science is somehow going to turn people away from religion.

In fact a huge chunk of the rest of the film is about God - yet he pretends that intelligent design is somehow not connected to God.  At one point Stein scoffs at the idea that aliens could have seeded the earth with life, but why scoff when that idea is 100% in keeping with intelligent design.  It involves a higher intelligence that ""designed"" life on earth, right?  So let's teach it in science classrooms!  It's just as legitimate as any other time-tested scientific theory...ha.

The movie concludes with more anti-science propaganda, trolling out every stereotypical fear of the religious right and trying to trump up a connection between that and science.  Apparently science is responsible for Hitler being evil (actual quote from the movie ""evil can sometimes be rationalized by science"" - Stein puts it in someones mouth during one of the ridiculous Nazi scenes).  And I suppose you want me to believe that evil was never rationalized by religion?  How many people have been brutalized, oppressed, murdered in the name of God?  Why did the Nazis kill Jews?  That stemmed directly from religion.

So from Nazism we go straight to an attack on Planned Parenthood (???), and from there Stein tries to blame science for abortion and euthanasia.  I guess he couldn't figure out how to rope any other staples of the religious-right's political agenda in, so the movie crescendos with statements about how science is attacking our freedom and all the wonderful things that America stands for.  Science is threatening the American dream.

Really?  You went there?  How ridiculous you have made yourself look, Ben Stein.  But I guess you are a comedian.",1319500800,7,4121,4.857962697274032
3500939,4,B001BYLFFS,"Just watch it.

The reviewers here on Amazon seem to think ""Expelled"" was about Darwinism vs Intelligent Design.  That was just the controversy used to prove Ben's point but was not the point.

There were many attacks on ""Expelled"" and Ben for making this video. There is even a website dedicated to exposing ""Expelled"" which in several points only serves to prove Ben's point; that the system of science, learning and academia in this country is very biased and will not allow teachings or ideas from creationists or intelligent design theorists to be admitted. (see video on home page of [...])

It is true that ""Expelled"" is one sided in only showing where the Darwinist system discriminates against and oppresses creationist and intelligent design theorists. I do not fault Ben for exposing prejudice from only one side. His video was not about prejudice in general but how academia today is a biased and oppressive camp and in what way.  Discrimination happens in every camp, it goes both ways.  Many churches and Bible colleges are guilty of the same oppression of the truth by silencing any student or teacher that might bring up different questions or ideas other than what is officially ""allowed"". I am a witnesses to that.

My only complaint about Ben's video ""Expelled"" was all the little clips in-between the real documentary that only serve to mock and manipulate.  Aren't these the tactics academia and other oppressive types use?  The video would have been great without stooping to the level of the camp he was trying to expose.

My favorite quotes from shunned scientists interviewed by Ben in ""Exposed"":
""Questions that aren't answered properly don't go away""
""He (Dawkins) doesn't have the rudimentary skills to meticulously assess his own arguments""

They put these so-called scientist supporting creationisme and intelligent design completly into the spotlight. Victimized by some conspiracy of a 'obscure darwinian organisation', but fail to talk bout the (real) reason why they got expelled. They have clearly the upperhand in this 'documentary'. And then you have real scientist shown by very short and select statements, shown as somewhat - in a dark place - as 'absurd, godforsaken men'.
This docu also doesn't even talk about the core of evolution or creationisme, or any way to define both. Nor realy about these scientist that got fired from their faculty or university. They are allowed to talk about their believes with no need of factual back-up. Had the director given the same amount of time and attention to the evolutionary scientist... well, we wouldn't have this 'duco' then...
Also their attempt to link the evolutionary science to Hitler and nazi-ism and somehow suggesting science is and leads to evil, is really lame. As if religion never caused tentions, wars and yes, even holocausts. Suggesting living without religion is an empty, evil life. That living without it makes you a radical athiest. Like there's no such thing as relgious fundamentalism. Although (the) burdens of religion are never mentioned here, living without it can be a relieve and a mind opener, and is in my opinion also worht of a debate. Still, the director didn't find it necessary to show both sides of the story.
This movie is full of opinion and propaganda and has a huge lack of data.
It's cheap approach suggested to show how this ideological group of people are stigmatised by the darwinian 'fascist' scientists. But the hypocrisy is easily detected in this film, with 'their' attempt to marginalize 'these' darwinians.
This documentary is misleading, and is doing so by using terms as freedom, and freedom of speach, and basic American Values to back up these 'creationist scientist' - a term of 2 words contradicting themself - and to give them some credibility - also cause they don't actually have to talk about what it is they realy believe in then, but more by magnifying on the disbelieves of the evolutionary scientists.

The director is clearly trying to manipulate your thoughts on the subject. Suggesting there is a wide belief of intelligent design (creationisme) amongts the scientists. But they are just afraid to talk about it...
Of course this is not true!
There is no such thing as a conspiracy. There is not even a debate amongst academics whether it's evolution or intelligent disign that's at the base of all life on this planet. Evolution is well accepted in the scientific world, where it is considered the organizing principle of biology. It is grotesk and a lie.
There is a reason why these creationists are expelled from a scientific classroom.
Intelligent design is based on opinion and not on facts.

I rated this movie with 1 star cause i had to rate it something to give this review.
I hope this was helpful.

The interiviews with the atheists and hard-core evolution proponents clearly demonstrate their lack of credibiilty. They refuse to allow open debate.

3500942,1,B001BYLFFS,"This is a copy and slight edit of my review from a streaming site where I saw it:

I am not going to bother picking apart the Intelligent design arguments, and instead address what the film claims to be: a documentary. The on-camera time of the people Ben Stein interviews is heavily skewed towards the ID proponents. The few clips of ""Darwinist"" scientists are very obviously edited so that the content of what is said can easily be taken out of context, which it is. The few anecdotes of people being fired or otherwise censured for their support of ID are accepted on faith and the official reasons for termination were dismissed summarily.

The claim to be about freedom of speech and inquiry is clearly a facade as ""darwinism"" is claimed to be an essential part of Nazi beliefs. This attack has absolutely nothing to do with the validity of a scientific theory or freedom of speech. Additionally, to assert that belief in evolution is necessary to commit such atrocities (a claim plainly asserted by one of the ID proponents) is patently false, lest one forget the Spanish Inquisition, Crusades, and 9/11. One may point out that my examples are not accurate representations of religions, which actually proves my point. Nazi's are not representative of Evolution supporters either.  Moreover, if Nazi's loved Darwin's theory of evolution so much, why was Charles Darwin on the list of banned authors for Nazi Germany? This entire portion of the documentary is a non-sequitur used solely to inflame the audience.

The ID proponents early in the film said that ID was not a religious explanation. Another later said that the motivation of the evolutionists is to say religion and science can't have anything to do with one another. That same IDer argued ""why not?"" If ID is not a theistic hypothesis, then why would religion even enter the picture? Any objective editor would have caught on to this blatant deception and pounced on it to point out that the objective of ID is to artificially inject god into science, just as one can see by the content of the 5 star reviews that the objective of ID is about promoting god, not about good science.

As for the example they gave of the origins of life and a ""simple"" cell. The cell described as having 1 GigaByte of data is a HUMAN cell. That is not the cell of the simplest organism on earth which has much, much less ""data"". The example was plainly chosen to deceive the audience. Any good fact checker could have found that the example was deceptive and nailed them right there.

In short, it is a propaganda piece, not a documentary. If you are an IDer, enjoy. If not, avoid.

For all you ""believers"" that insist that evolution is ""just a theory"" I encourage you to read Francis Collins book ""The Language of God"".  He is a staunch Christian and renowned geneticist, and he says quite clearly that either evolution is true or God would have to have placed genetic information into DNA with the intent of deliberately deceiving us into thinking it were true.  It would have been nice to see Ben Stein interview someone like him to show that it's not just an ""us vs them"" situation in the academic/scientific community.  Sadly, it is polarizing stuff that gets the most attention, and based on the reviews here, it doesn't get much more polarized than this piece of garbage.",1317427200,11,3327,4.710843373493976

As most have noted it is superbly laid out and organized, and thankfully witty and engaging even for teens. I say thankfully because starting in 7th grade the attack on free-thinking and tolerance for anything but the Darwinist narrative is often revealed in all it's ugliness by many of the faculty teaching our kids today.

I deplore that science has been perverted by the statist mindset to the point where the actual true answers are no longer as important to discover as the politically correct answers.

And of course since the answers from primitive scientists 150 years ago are increasingly in doubt with each new discovery of irreducible complexity etc., the devotees to them are increasingly strident and nasty in their opposition, to the point as illistrated so well in the movie, that no freedom of thought is to be tolerated...evidence be damned!

3500946,5,B001BYLFFS,"This documentary makes some very good points about freedom.  I thought that the point of view concerning a bias with respect to the theory of evolution among scientists was presented very persuasively.  This is, however, a deep matter, and the documentary presented many aspects fairly superficially.  For example, it was never clearly stated precisely what ""intelligent design"" constituted, if one wishes to include that as a part of science.  Furthermore, the enormous amount of biological and geological evidence in support of the theory of evolution was never really stated clearly.  On the other hand, I do think that there is a ""party line"", and a ""Berlin wall"" that is more than just the result of the unbiased workings of science and the ""system"".  I think that because there is a lot of superficiality involved in the many topics only briefly touched upon in the documentary, many people are labeling this film as propaganda.  I feel that the evidence for the theory of evolution is compelling, but I do see that this film presents a point of view that is far from just being propaganda.  I do feel that, among the elite in science, there are many whose minds are closed to other possibilities, and who do have an agenda of encouraging atheism.",1316217600,2,1253,4.877358490566038

3500949,1,B001BYLFFS,"Let me say that I am a Bible-believing Christian, and I accept evolution as a plausible theory with an incredibly rich array of evidence to support it, and that it does not in the least way contradict what is revealed by God in the Bible.  I have been researching the Intelligent Design vs. evolution and origins debate for some time.  I often read research articles in AAAS Science and other publications, and I have read, or am beginning to read, books by many of the major contributors to this area of study -- Christian and otherwise -- even those who hold to the view that the earth was created in a literal 6 days, 6000 years ago.  From Francis Collins, Deborah Haarsma, Denis Lamoureux, Kenneth Miller, Owen Gingerich, Michael Hawley to John Morris, Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer,  William Dembski, I've been reading their wildly differing views on this topic.  (I have also read Coyne and Dawkins, who are atheists.  They've done sound research but reach the wrong conclusions).

To my main point:  I finally purchased the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed to see what the fuss is about, since it is referenced by a number of Christian Web sites.  It's one of the highest-grossing documentaries ever produced.  I purchased it because it was recommeded to me as a balanced view of the controversy, and in any case, it's something I've been meaning to watch for quite some time.

In the past several months, I've listened to recorded sermons (not from my church) and read articles in the Christian press claiming that there is a great conspiracy among scientists to ""hide the facts"".  Yes, astronomers, chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, are all in a grand conspiracy to hide facts and suppress the truth.  Where is this coming from, I asked myself?  Well, this movie arrived in the mail.  It's a slick presentation, well-produced and presented in a very emotionally engaging tone.  This movie starts out with a long intro depicting Nazi Germany.  The film's references to Naziism continue as we hear interviews with ID researchers who describe their interaction with other scientists.  After watching about 1/3 of this film, I finally got it.  Is this where they're getting their ""information""?  I say 1/3, because I had to stop when Ben Stein compared the entire scientific research community to -- Holocaust deniers.  To my sensibilities, that's the epitome of evil.  Think about that comparison for a moment.  Thoroughly disgusted, I  couldn't watch any further.  I had to pause for a few hours and collect my breath before continuing.

The rest of the movie is fraught with technical inaccuracies about cell biology, statistics, information theory, and strawman arguments reflecting a misunderstanding of the definition of common terms used in evolutionary biology.  An assumption is first presented, through one-sided interviews, that evolution implies an atheistic worldview, and toward the end it is stated explicitly.  Of course -- wait for it -- they trot out Richard Dawkins and his scathing, anti-Christian vitriol, and portray him as the evolution poster child.

Just as it started, the movie wraps up with a prolonged exposition of how Charles Darwin's ideas led directly to Hitler's regime.  (""THIS... was a connection I had to explore personally"", says Ben Stein ominously).  We are taken on a tour of Nazi execution chambers, complete with dissection tables, followed up up by a prolonged discussion of eugenics and abortion.  Finally, we have a tie-in to the erosion of freedoms in our own country and the implication that the United States will follow the course of Nazi Germany if ""evolutionists"" are not stopped.  All of this is wrapped up in a slick, emotionally engaging, easy to digest format.

Godwin's Law, anyone?  Read the Wikipedia article about this movie, the section entitled ""Charles Darwin Quotation Issue"",  and then tell me Ben Stein is anyone to be trusted.  As referenced therein -- to prop up his claim that the theory of evolution inspired Nazism, Ben Stein attributes the following statement to Charles Darwin's book ""The Descent of Man"":

""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.""

As stated, this would be a monstrous indictment, making the claim that Darwin is proposing that there is something wrong with a society that preserves its weakest members. The original source, however, shows that Stein has edited the text past recognition. The original and subsequent paragraphs in Darwin's book reveal the opposite tone and meaning, expressing reverence for the civilized man who cares for the needy, even at great cost:

""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.

""The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely the weaker and inferior members of society not marrying so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased, though this is more to be hoped for than expected, by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage.""

Don't get me wrong -- I believe in the concept of Intelligent Design, and I will attest to anyone within earshot that God designed the universe and Mankind and everything in between for the express purpose of us knowing Him.  But the Intelligent Design movement, as the term is commonly used, is far from the Truth.

How long is it going to take to reverse the damage -- not just to student education but to our Christian faith -- caused by this movie, this kind of sentiment, and this style of journalism?

Could it be true?  Are these individuals really being persecuted as portrayed by the movie?  Or are they simply conducting bad science and being exposed to the same critical inquiry that ALL scientsts are?  I've been published (long ago) and I've participated in the peer review process a couple times, so I have some idea of how the sausage is made.  If you have seen this movie and believe its message, read the Wikipedia article about the movie.

As for the subject matter of the controversy portrayed in the film:  If you are an atheist, or are unsure about God, please try to be open to this: have a Bible in hand and read ""The Language of God"" or ""The Language of Science and Faith"" by Francis Collins, who is the Director of the NIH and is an evangelical Christian.  I can also recommend ""Origins"" by Deborah Haarsma -- a professor at Calvin College.

Conversely, if you know the Lord and you distrust scientific discoveries because you believe you are interpreting Genesis correctly, the same books may be an eye-opener.  Something is either true, or it isn't.  Truth comes from God.  Jesus said, ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"".  If we are created to worship God in all his splendor and majesty and we are placed on this Earth to seek after Jesus, there is no greater pursuit than seeking the Truth.",1314230400,13,8884,4.86578073089701
3500950,2,B001BYLFFS,"The role of a documentary is to enlighten.  Usually a documentary filmmaker will choose a case and, if they are very good, they will present the case to their audience and allow them to make up their own minds about it.  I've seen well over 200 documentaries in my life and many achieve that goal.  If that is what you're interested in, this is not the film for you.  I understand that reviews and comments on this film are politically charged, so bear with me.  This film may not be one of the great ones that allows you to judge the case made based on it's merit, but I'll bet if we asked the director, he'd say that wasn't what he was going for anyway.  The point of this film is not to present facts from a neutral lens, but to appeal to your emotion.  Left or right, that is what some documentary filmmakers do.  That said, my main problem with documentaries like that is they will tend to frame an argument in such a way as to make it black or white.  They will look for information that only supports the argument being made.  I found myself constantly coming back to a key point that was repeated - that the scientific community was somehow ideologically opposed at a very fundamental level to creationism.  It implied more than once that it was because of a lack of faith and a fear of what the scientific community might actually find.

I watched this movie because I'm actually pretty well read on this particular subject.  When it returned to those ""evolutionism"" points (liking evolution to some sort of religion) it smacked of the exact same lack of understanding of which they accused scientists.  The problem here is that science is not religion and is not faith based.  It is based on observation and experimentation with peer-reviewed documentation of findings.  In every debate that involved both sides, Intelligent Designers were asked for the requisite peer-reviewed repeatable findings and were not able to meet up to the minimum scientific requirements.  The same requirements that established the theory of plate tectonics, gravity, matter, fusion, etc.  So in essence, they were asking for some sort of special exemption from scientific qualification?  I couldn't wrap my head around that.  After that point, they lost me.  I tried to watch with an open mind, but even open minds have limits.  This one stops when facts begin to wane in favor of hyperbole.

If you're pro or anti, you'll likely come away from this movie with your opinions unchanged.  For the money, I want more than to have my ego stroked and suspicions affirmed.  I want to come away a little smarter than I was before.  Why else would I watch a documentary?  If you want affirmation, rent it.

3500951,3,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein is well-known to recent generations as the deadpan teacher from ""The Wonder Years"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" as well as the host/star of ""Win Ben Stein's Money"".  To an earlier generation I believe he was connected to the Nixon Administration as a speech writer or something like that.  Nevertheless, this is a very sharp man who decides to involve himself in this documentary on the eroding academic freedom in the US.

The film takes on the Intelligent Design issue, certainly a divisive topic among not only scientists but also between fundamentalist and all other Christians.  The issue is timely, given that many civil liberties are eroding in the US and that there is a rise in the media support of the right wing (see the scary documentary ""Outfoxed"").

I gave this good documentary three stars not because of what it contains, which is good, but for what it might've contained: I believe it would've been even better if Ben Stein's deadpan, sardonic wit were put to use (he plays this one pretty straight); it also would have benefitted from a passing reference to a similar problem of academic freedom that has occurred over the last several years among theologians in the Catholic colleges and universities in the US.  They also are under scrutiny to toe the Vatican line on ""orthodox"" and not ""fringe"" theology, and many progressive theologians have lost their positions, just as these scientists have.

The arguments presented are nonsensical, the 'witty' commentary is often merely illogical but actually crosses over into being non sequitur in a few places.  For a movie 'about science', nothing but opinion is presented; and that opinion is largely not even presented as part of an argument: you just get hit with disconnected opinion after disconnected opinion.  To the extent the movie does present any kind of cohesive message, it seems to be that 'ID deserves a seat at the table, no matter what, always.'  But it is so muddled with dejected ex-academic staff, an apparently pointless segment on eugenics and Nazism, heavy editing and so on, that even that gets a little lost.

And then the whole thing ends on a speech about freedom, which (a) has nothing to with science and (b) doesn't mean the 90% of people who disagree with you have to listen/respect/pay you.  It was there at the beginning too... which is what I think the script may have originally focused on, before some kind of wholesale but not complete revision.  Maybe?

3500973,4,B001BYLFFS,"I am fascinated by the reactions this film creates. The premise of the movie has to do with freedom of inquiry, of thought and speech. Those who question aspects of Darwinism try to consider other options. While the term Intelligent Design may raise red flags for some people, what other term could be used? Those who object to the movie often do not point to any particular and concrete argument. It may be that the film is ""quote mining"" as one says. However, it is difficult to dispute what Richard Dawkins says about some higher intelligence in another universe that may have had a hand in our own evolution. The fact that a movie such as this provokes name calling rather than reasonable debate is very interesting. I doubt that the idea of the film is one of conspiracy, but rather demonstrates the ""politically correct"" environment in which we live. It is not politically correct to believe in anything other than Darwinian evolution. Those who do not are stereotyped as narrow minded or, worse, religious fanatics. There can be no debate if one side resorts to name calling. My question is why do we find it so threatening to even question evolution? I think some of the negative reviews demonstrate quite well the nature of the issue. Are we free to disagree without fear of being called crazy? Of course universities are anxious to protect and guard themselves for fear of losing funding. And, of course, a university is free to hire or fire anyone who does not agree with the philosophy or standards of the institution. Would the film have caused such heated reactions if it had dealt with lack of freedom of expression in the humanities, for example? The movie is thought provoking. And note that Stein does not say that evolution caused the Holocaust, he simply says the Nazis took evolutionary theory and put it into practice and we saw the results. The Nazis caused the Holocaust, their understanding of evolution helped them bring it about. I am not sure what to think about the film, but I think it is worth viewing simply because of the questions it raises.

3500974,1,B001BYLFFS,"I confess that I have found Ben Stein to be a funny and charming guy over the years.  I particularly liked him during his days with young Jimmy Kimmel on the comedy central show Win Ben Stein's money. On that show you saw that Ben is a pretty smart guy and funny and likable as well. And I even found this latest bit of sophomoric simplistic propaganda more colorful and entertaining than I expected.  Yes, it is a bunch of illogic and distortions and half truths but the production values were nice and Ben got lots of nice travel out of it. The movie sort of has Ben running around crying ""freedom, freedom, freedom"", the ""sky is falling.""  Ben's interview with Richard Dawkins was shameful -- A chance to meet Richard Dawkins and actually learn something but Ben wastes the entire opportunity asking pathetically assine questions. Ben your career is circling the drain.

One more thing: Google the phrase ""Six Things in Expelled That Ben Stein Doesn't Want You to Know.""  Many links appear.  I would suggest you choose the one from Scientific American magazine.

And I have another criticism of Ben. It is called ""reducto ad Hiterarium"".  (see Wikipedia on this term.) Ben uses this technique in this movie.  And the ""Six things"" articles reveals Ben's distortians of what Darwin actual said.  And another criticism, wikipedia mentions I believe that in a debate with Ron Paul over the Iraq and Afganistan wars, Ben called Paul's criticism of those wars ""anti-semetic"".  He later appologized.

3500980,5,B001BYLFFS,"If I remember aright, this film was savaged on its initial release, with the reaction running all the way from ""A film for hate-filled morons"" to ""A film for hate-filled morons.""

Well, that was then, and this is now.  This film has not done a disappearing act, and is in fact a very valuable documentary, which covers the very curious ""reverse-Galileo"" process currently taking place.  By this I mean, we have listened to countless inaccurate accounts of how the hate-filled moronic Popes persecuted the poor innocent Galileo.  Now that the shoe is on the other foot, and Atheist Scientists Inc. are persecuting anyone who thinks that science and religion may have something valuable to say to each other -- including firing them on the spot --- the atheist scientists seem curiously unable to see that they are ""The New Popes.""

Conformism is interesting.  When I grew up in the 1950's, the curse word was ""atheist"" and a divorced man had no hope of winning the Presidency.  Nowadays, ""religious"" has become the new curse word, and atheism is a badge of honor.  The thing that did not change was the conformity, the group-think, and the dismissive hate of non-conformists.

This film is very valuable and worth owning for a number of reasons.  The first would be the amazing computer simulation of the animal cell, which is what caused all the uproar in the first place.  The second would be Richard Dawkins gladly confessing that he had no problem with the concept of intelligent design!!  However, he insisted that the designers would have to be space aliens from another planet --- something which struck him as possible and likely, while the idea of a God involved in creation was absolutely ridiculous.

This struck me as passing strange, that ANYONE would put more faith in unknown, hypothetical space aliens from the planet Xoto (OK, I made that up) than in one of mankind's oldest hypotheses, which is simply that God created the heavens and the earth.  This indicated to me just how far someone as bloody-minded as Dawkins would go to exclude God. ""Space aliens are much more likely!""

The third thing I really liked about this documentary was the fact that it interviewed a lot of the major players on both sides of the debate, and clearly established the fact that one side ruled the roost, and had no qualms about persecuting its intellectual enemies.

For honesty-in-reviewing, I am a lifelong atheist who recently dropped the ""a"" and am now a theist.  I have no stake in any organized religion, but I do have a huge stake in the concept and practice of freedom, most definitely including intellectual freedom in our universities.

Watch this movie and make up your own mind.  My firm opinion (as of today) is that a huge paradigm shift is underway, and the Old Guard is panicking.

3500982,5,B001BYLFFS,"This is a devastating condemnation of the current scientific culture that equates ""science"" with agnosticism and outright atheism. The genius of Stein here is that he shows that even the top scientists in the world simply cannot answer the most basic of existential questions, and yet they condemn the very ideas behind intelligent design (and equate ID with creationism) without serious inquiry because, presumably, the adherents of ID attempt to address those same existential questions in a rational manner that doesn't fit the prejudices of those so-called leading scientists.

In fact, Stein shows, without stating, that the whole debate is in essence a religious discussion with scientists using the notion of ""science"" or ""scientific consensus"" as a dogmatic weapon against the heretics - in this case, those scientists who are exploring anything relating to ID. How ironic is that!

Stein shows how ""science"" has been hijacked by atheists and agnostics to support their own Godless worldview (life came from crystals? aliens perhaps? how is that any more scientific than the idea that the universe indicates an intelligent creator?) What's amazing is how oblivious some of these ""scientists"" are to the simple fact that science is about seeking the truth, which presupposes the need to keep a radically open mind to ALL possibilities, ESPECIALLY in this case, where there is no proof anywhere to counter the idea that there was intelligence at work at the inception of life. The scientists Stein interviews are as dogmatic and certain of their superior knowledge as any religious idiot, defending their theories and dogma with an ignorant zeal that Stein skillfully gets them to disclose.

Anyway, brilliant movie. Stein deserves an Oscar, which will NOT be forthcoming, because he too effectively devastates the sacred cows of modernism. He takes on Darwinism, atheism, and certain dogmatic scientists with wit and intelligence - and wins. I love how the apologists for ""science"" are attacking Stein with all of the ad hominem indignant vigor of a court of Inquisition. It's funny to watch.

Remember that episode of the office where Toby can't bring himself to enter a church and instead wanders around out in the courtyard and finally ascends the steps and addresses his issues with God alone in the chapel? That reminds me of the scientists who can't bring themselves to even consider the possibility that there is a God, because they have unresolved childhood issues with the church, their parents, or whatever. And when they describe why they are atheists, it's always a conversion story of how they came to ""see the light"" that the false God they or their parents had previously worshipped could not possibly exist.

Evolutionists have much to lose. Secretly, they know that Darwinism is a troubled theory that has been patched endlessly, like a bad tire. It is a joy to see Ben Stein visit with these evolutionists, and expose their absurd explanations for the origins of life (seeding of the planet by extra-terrestrials, anyone?) which they proffer as a ""refutation"" to the notion of design. But more than a much deserved comeuppance and expos, the film shows the potential progression of Darwinian thought - how it can lead, given an evil mind (like Hitler), to eugenics, to genocide.

Let me make just one quote from the Klinghoffer article: Most disturbing of all, in The Descent of Man, Darwin prophesied: ""At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races.""
Darwin's theory says that you can have a watch without a watchmaker. Am I stupid if I see something that took a lot of intelligence to make that I would naturally think there is a intelligent maker behind it? Am I stupid for seeing the good sense in the following video?
[...]
People who believe that it is reasonable to see design and a designer behind creation are seen as stupid by the Darwinist who control what can be taught and thought at the universities. But to me these Darwinist, with their science pedigrees cannot see what is obvious to most people. For example
from my way of thinking it would be pretty silly to think for example a child's wagon given enough time could evolve into a Mercedes-Benz.
It would have to appear whole cloth cause the intermediate steps, like half a motor and half a cooling system, would not help it ""survive"".
It would be to heavy for the child to enjoy and would not run to take an adult to work.
To me even the simplist things like a pencil or a birdhouse need their own blueprint. Now it is true the same being that made the blueprint
for the pencil could make the blueprint for the birdhouse but one did not evolve from the other. Also it seems pretty silly to me
that you could randomly nail boards together and given enough time you would have a mansion. With out a blueprint and the intelligence to follow the blue print all you would have is a crazy mess. I know as a teacher I cannot talk about the possiblity of an intelligent designer. Why is this topic become taboo? Do you think our founder George Washington would have tried to stop the debate, this free exchange of ideas?
[...]
When did Darwin's theory evolve into fact? Which scientist has proved one species can turn into another species? Everyone knew that within a species you could have or breed variation. But who knows how to turn a cat into a dog? Or a monkey into a man? They are simply different blueprints. And yes it looks like the same designer made both.
The topic is a crucial one because by the time our children are out of college they are molded into scientific materialist who have been brainwashed by atheisitic professors that belief in a higher power is nonsense, supernatural garbage, and to question scientific materialism makes you out to be a laughable fool.
This movie addresses the ""gulag"" of thinking our kids are being pressed into and hopefully shines a light that can open up the debate and allow people to think outside the Darwinian box imposed on them by a group of elite intellectuals who are desperate to keep God out of the classroom and the debate. Why is the debate such a passionate one? Because this debate touches on the struggle between good and evil. God affirming people and God denying people are in an age old struggle for the hearts and minds of the next generation. What is at stake? Our nations inalienable rights either come from our creator or the state. God forbid we lose our heritage because the state will become our god. With this we will see the worst kind of tyranny.

3501012,1,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stine's ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" uses poor research, misleading arguments, and leaves out counter-arguments. For instance, in the beginning, Stine interviews Michael Shermer about an instance when an intelligent design proponent reportedly lost his job as a result of publishing an article on the subject. Michael Shermer had not heard of that instance and Stine neglected to ask any other person about what had precisely occurred. If you do a little research, however, you discover that the editor of the journal had lost his job because he had published the article without actually having the article peer-reviewed. While Stine had presented this example to show that the academia is biased in favor of evolution, the example was actually an instance of an editor being unfairly biased in favor of intelligent design. The outrage that ensued was due to the poor research performed by the publisher of the article.

Also, Stine equate ""Darwinism"" with ""Naziism."" This is a common, yet fallacious, argument. According to Stine, the Holocaust occurred as a direct result of Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Although I am not arrogant enough to pretend to know the root cause of the Holocaust (as Ben Stine is arrogant enough to claim he does know), I would like to present a quick counter-argument that Stine failed to mention: the New Testament of the Christian Bible is obviously very anti-semitic. Stine claims throughout the film that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is anti-Christian, and then he believes that the Theory caused the Holocaust. Why doesn't he mention that the New Testament has been fuel for anti-Semitism for years? Again, I do not want to claim that Christianity is the cause of the Holocaust. I am simply stating a simplistic counter-argument to Ben Stine's simplistic argument.

Finally, while Ben Stine presents many random people who claim that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a ""mess"" and a ""cloud of smoke,"" he fails to mention the numerous problems with intelligent design. Examples: perhaps the world was intelligently designed. Perhaps, the answers to our current questions will someday be answered by a higher power. However, this does not mean that we should jump to hasty conclusions. No one knows everything about the world. No one. A few hundred years ago, people thought the Earth was flat. The wisest people were willing to say ""I don't know the answer"" and then they would go search for the answer. The reason intelligent design is discouraged is because, even though it could some day gain evidence in support, it has not produced a shred of evidence to date. Evidence cannot be produced in the form of a negative. You cannot say ""this is too complex."" It must have been caused by a higher power. You must say, ""What is the meaning of this?"" And then find some answer that directly points to a higher power. You can't just say ""I don't know"" and then say ""it must be God."" Another problem with intelligent design is that it reduces God to the gaps. Every time a scientist discovers a fossil, God gets smaller. That's ridiculous. Another issue is that intelligent design fails in exactly the same area that inteligent design proponents claim evolution fails in: gaps. Intelligent design proponents claim that there is a lack of traditional fossils for each species to have arose (this is not true, but I'll humor the argument for now). Well, intelligent design has an even worse flaw. Not only does it fail to answer how each species arose, but it also fails to mention how the intellignet designer arose! One last point: Ben Stine seems to believe that this intelligent designer is a compassionate God who desires worship, as do most intelligent design proponents. Where is the evidence for that? If anything, the fact that 95% of the species on Earth have gone extinct suggests that the intelligent designer is either an idiot or malevolent.",1301184000,8,3892,4.986153846153846
3501013,1,B001BYLFFS,"If several academics and editors lost their jobs and were blacklisted for merely mentioning Intelligent Design, that would not only be unfair, but evidence of serious bias and closed-mindedness in the scientific community.  But Stein's approach in the rest of the film leads me to question whether there may not have been some other reason for these people to be dismissed, that had nothing to do with Intelligent Design.  The film is so full of errors and distortions in its other areas, that I suspect we are not being told the whole story here either.

Stein takes pains to establish that ""Intelligent Design"" has nothing to do with ""Creationism;"" an inaccurate statement in light of the court battles to insert the Biblical Creationist agenda into the public schools by teaching Intelligent Design as a valid theory.  Maybe the scientists quoted in this film have nothing to do with those efforts, but Stein's approach is simply to deny the connection with no information or discussion.

No explanation or definition is ever given of Intelligent Design.  We keep hearing of it as opposed to ""Darwinism;"" are we to assume that ID proponents do not believe in natural selection as a mechanism of evolution?  Or do they not believe in evolution at all; that is, every species alive today was always in its present form?  As far as I can tell from the film, ID is mainly concerned with the transition from inorganic material to organic life.  Supposedly, no one knows how this happened, and several scientists are quoted as speculating ""it grew on crystals"" or ""extraterrestrials seeded the Earth.""  So in that context, ID isn't too much of a stretch.  However, any scientist who seriously advanced any of those crackpot theories would encounter strong skepticism from the rest of the community.  Instead, we are told that ""250 proteins"" would have to assemble themselves ""at random"" to produce the first cell.  Since the probability of this is so remote, it must have been the result of ID, rather than chance.  This ignores the possibility that there could have been simpler transitional forms we have not found yet.  It's also a mischaracterization of natural selection as ""random,"" when in fact it is nothing of the kind.  ID here is basically the ""god of the gaps"" explanation - those things we cannot explain could be the result of a deity's actions.  But the ID explanation raises more questions, that Stein, an apparently intelligent, and supposedly open-minded person, does not explore.

ID inevitably implies a designer.  ""I think, therefore, I am,"" or in Nietzsche's rephrasing, ""there is thinking, therefore, something is doing the thinking.""  What is the nature of this designer?  Is it a material object, pure energy, or something else?  How does this designer implement its designs in the material world?  And most importantly, how did it develop the ability to come up with these designs?  I have always found it astonishing that religious people who claim that the universe ""could not have come from nothing,"" have no trouble believing in a designer who exists with no parents, no teachers, no progenitors of any kind.  Ultimately, the basis for reality is moved from a natural process to a supernatural one.

My main objection to the film is Stein's disgusting use of Nazism to tar ""Darwinism"" (whatever that is).  Since Hitler believed he was implementing the principles of ""natural selection"" by murdering his enemies, Stein argues that ""Darwinism leads to Nazism.""  But blaming Darwin for Hitler is like blaming Jesus for the Rev. Fred Phelps.  Hitler was a vegetarian, a lover of dogs, and enjoyed Beethoven - are all those now suspect?  If Stein is to be consistent, he must now reject Capitalism, since that philosophy led to the enslavement of Africans and the genocide of Native Americans.  And there is not enough space to mention the horrors that religion has inflicted, and in many places is still inflicting, on its victims.

This leads to the one valid point in the film, that the debate is not merely about ""Darwinism"" vs. ID, or ""academic freedom,"" but the scientific worldview against the religious one.  Toward the end, one scientist discusses how science led him to atheism.  This, and the discussion around it, is the most telling aspect of the film.  This is the reason why Galileo was persecuted.  Over the past few centuries, advances in science and rational understanding of nature have progressively diminished the role of religion.  That terrible force, which dominated all aspects of society in the Middle Ages, has gradually shrunk down, for most people, into a hobby or a weekly social club.  Stein, like many political conservatives, even non-religious ones (and Stein, as far as I can tell, is not very religious), laments this - they see religion as a purely positive force in society, and its diminishing influence a sign of degeneration.  For those of us who believe the opposite, ID is nothing more than an attempt to sneak religion in under the guise of legitimate science.  As Stein himself points out, we would not include the flat earth theory in a science class.  Excluding it, and ID, is not stifling debate - it is a matter of not giving nonsense the same respect as rational inquiry.",1299888000,22,5243,4.946285714285715

3501026,1,B001BYLFFS,"This film is filled with nothing but pseudoscience and creationist arguments thinly disguised. The film's main arguments are as follows: evolution doesn't have as much evidence as scientists say, there is another idea called intelligent design that is a valid hypothesis (they call it a theory not knowing what a real scientific theory means), and that the scientific community is in a vast conspiracy to silence anyone that speaks bad about evolution.

First off, evolution is the second most supported theory in all of science, next to quantum theory. It is the backbone of all the life sciences. It has been supported for over a century by hundreds of thousands of cases where it was used to make predictions, directly observed, and re-supported again and again from genetics, archeology, biology, and the list goes on. There is NO controversy regarding evolution. This is a ploy (which seems to be working) by the religious groups to make evolution seem less credible. As far as science goes, evolution is an established fact and has more support than gravity. No one in the scientific community questions the validity of evolution, only dispute certain details in the inner workings. The rest of the world knows this. There's a reason why the US is doing so poorly in science. Without understand how evolution works you cannot sufficiently have a career in medicine. Modern medicine goes hand in hand with evolutionary theory.

The second point regarding intelligent design being a credible alternative has already been dealt with in the court system. The trial Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, which took place in 2005 has ruled that intelligent design cannot be taught in science classrooms, is just creationism in disguise and has no scientific basis. The Judge John E. Jones III, is a conservative Republican appointed in 2002 by George W. Bush. Even so, he still came to this ruling after hearing the facts and evidence. In a fair trial, intelligent design doesn't stand a chance by a long shot.

The last point is pretty simple. There is no vast conspiracy to silence those that disagree with evolution. The scientific community simply doesn't take people serious who try to pass off religious creationism as science. That is all, plain and simple. If there were actual, real scientific evidence to dispute evolution, and if somehow evolution where to be disproven that would probably be the most revolutionary finding in all of science surely winning them a nobel prize. Scientists would love to have the chance to make such a discovery. The reason why it hasn't happened is because evolution is true. It is an established scientific fact.

As an after thought, many of the real scientists in the film, such as Richard Dawkins were tricked into being interviewed for the film after they were lied to about the film's subject matter. The Dawkins interview in particular is nothing but taking his statements out of context and manipulative editing.

Is this quote supposed to be Mr. Stein's? It appears he is refferring to evolution as ""random chance"" which most every science interested person knows IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF EVOLUTION!

To speak this out loud is to say that you have no idea what the scientific method is, what the scientific community is, how people become members of the scientific community and how they become EX-members.

THIS my friends demonstrates and illustrates that responsible adults can still believe this theologic.....argument(?). Darrel Ray explained this in his book ""The God Virus"". When a child is abused by it's parents via the inculcation of religion before the age of reason, the child never puts the concept through the otherwise requisite of ""rationalization"". This missing step is an essential one - without rationalizing, the mental process perceive the concept as ""natural"" and it is then held as an ""instinct"" that needs no answers, just compliance OR ELSE!

THIS is how Congresspersons, lawyers, doctors, cops and generally rational people can hold beliefs like talking snakes, virgin births, talking bushes, great floods and the rest of the features ubiquitus to religion. Religious visions are almost ALL attributed to temporal lobe epilepsy which creates an anomoly on the visual cortex - the manifestation of which confuses the ill person into believing that visions from inside the brain are actually happening physically in front of them.

In fact I don't understand why this film has not been more in the public eye than it has because it is so informative, yet at the same time very entertaining. It covers issues that should get the attention of any thinking person when it comes to how life began and also covers the issue of genocide and eugenics..... something I've read about before, and a subject we should all be concerned about lest history repeat itself. Ben takes us on a journey to the German concentration camps for a chilling reminder about this.
He also does a wonderful job of approaching people and presenting them with controversial questions while still maintaining a courteous and relaxed demeanor, this definitely takes a certain amount of discipline I think and is much to his credit.
I was especially taken by the way he interviewed Richard Dawkins, an atheist, author and so-called educated man, and he did it in such a way as to expose Dawkins' total lack of clear insight in the realm of Intelligent Design versus Darwinism. I continue to find it funny how direct questions toward people like Dawkins as to how life itself actually came into being, are always deflected, evaded and never given a direct answer.
If you've ever wanted to see a good documentary that poses questions about these things, then this film is a must see and one you won't soon forget.",1297555200,13,1478,4.623574144486692
3501031,5,B001BYLFFS,"For a mainstream intellectual and former presidental speech writer, Ben Stein, to go out on a limb like this and argue an unpopular possibility, if not certainty, is praiseworthy. Funny enough that those who don't agree with him and scientists who also argue that origins of life are more then just coincidental, have very little to show for their disagreement. They dare not go into exact details of how life came about, while claiming that all others are wrong.

The main point of this film is not ""creationism vs Darwinism"" as much as the problems that one encounters when trying to argue in favor of intelligent design and problems that follow this kind of scientific dogma.

One interesting aspect of Darwinist argument is their need to distort the counter argument to make it easier to ""win"". Perhaps Ben Stein fails to draw parallels there to other intollerant, arrogant types. This type of distortion can lead to great evil. Hitler too needed to distort the truth about Jews, and others he disliked in order to justify his actions against them. Today's Darwinists do the same thing: they pronounce everyone who sees clearly that life does not come up just by accident ""crazy"", ""religous zealots"", ""boring"", ""stupid"" and so on, and hope that their ""arguments"" will win them points with the masses.

This film gets well deserved five stars from me not only for its contents, but also for the daring approach and going where very few dare go publicly.",1297209600,13,1456,4.862903225806452
3501032,5,B001BYLFFS,"I'm getting this movie for ALL of my Darwin loving friends...and they will probably give it a bitter one star review here on Amazon. This movie is brilliantly done and skewers the anti ID crowd. I love reading the one star reviews,a lot of them vaguely critical offering no evidence at all that they actually viewed the film. That should tell you right there that there is meat in this documentary. My favorite part was toward the end of the doc when Stein gets Richard Dawkins, atheist numero uno, to state that he denies the existence of any religious deity but believes that it's possible that mankind was created by aliens that seeded the planet. Hey Richard, who created the aliens? On one hand Dawkins is denying God because there is actually no scientific evidence that he/she exists, yet on the other he is willing to accept that aliens exist when there is no scientific evidence that THEY exist.

This is not a pro-creationist film. This is a pro-scientific, freedom to do research, anti-fascist scientific community film. He never supports a pro right wing, Christian, ""God created the world in six days"", point of view. He simply attacks the American, and world scientific view that Intelligent Design is not possible and that anyone who believes otherwise should be crucified for daring to question the teachings of Darwin.

The people that hate this film are the same people that also believe Global Warming is a man-made threat to our survival. That science is falling apart and being exposed as the politically, anti-American BS that it is and this Darwin is GOD crap will fall too.

3501033,1,B001BYLFFS,"This work is so ham-handedly propogandistic (not to mention self-glorifying) that it is hard to know whether it is intentionally over the top for effect, or truly clueless about the real issues. Stein pretends to be defending the freedom to think and speak, but he is defending the right to teach metaphysics in science classes. In America, you can think and say whatever you want, but not necessarily -- thank goodness -- where you want. Academic freedom is not the issue. You don't have the right to sell your faith in everyone's living room, and you don't have the right to sell it in a science class either. A few of Stein's interviewees claim that ID is not religion, and one interviewee makes ID sound more like Buddhism than Western theism.  But most of the film unapologetically tries to wed religion and science, as when Stein suggests that anarchy and nihilism ensue when faith dies. Like the worst modern religious crusaders, Stein talks as if secular humanism invented evil and genocide, and polarizes human destiny between Darwin and supernaturalism, which merely pits the extremists on both sides against each other. That generates much heat, but little light.

The main issue is banning the teaching of Intelligent Design in science classes. Keeping ID out of science class is like keeping politics out of mathematics class or Chinese out of French class. It's not a matter of freedom; it's a matter of disciplinary organization. Intelligent Design is worth discussing in religion classes or metaphysics classes or philosophy of science classes or current events classes, but not science classes. Modern science is experimental science and the evidence of experimental science cannot show God's signature. ID arguments either (a) plug God into the gaps of evolutionary science and call it an explanation, or (b) raise legitimate questions about the concept of causation, which belong in a philosophy class. Either way, they offer no scientific evidence of their own. In short, it's a metaphysical thesis about the limits of the science; but that is not modern science, and it is not fascistic to limit science classes to modern science (they don't teach Aristotle's science either).

Unfortunately, as with so many evangelicals, it's not enough for ID folks that they can write books and give talks on religion and philosophy. They want to evangelize everywhere, and Stein wants ""freedom"" to sell ID in science classes. But rather than consider in detail whether ID is science, he just interviews ID proponents who are scientists who can't distinguish between a metaphysical explanation and scientific one. Rather than shed light on the heart of the issue, Stein blames the Nazis on Darwin, though he is silent on religion's responsibility for the Canaanite genocides by the ancient Jews, the Christian Inquisitions and witch-burnings, and militant Islamism. In other words, science is convicted by its extremists, but not religion. So much for responsible reporting.

This is not good religion or good science or good history. Rather than watch this offensive fiasco, read one of the numerous decent books with both sides of the ID issue represented. Or read ""Back to Darwin"" for some serious linkages between non-Darwinian evolution and religion.",1296777600,11,3263,5.162570888468809
3501034,3,B001BYLFFS,"In some ways this is a very thought provoking movie that has very little to do with the evidence for or against evolution. Ben Stein has succeeded in creating a conspiracy movie about mainstream science's suppression of the ""truth"" of intelligent design. He elevates the viewers passion against evolution by connecting darwinism and Nazism (with plenty of Third Reich clips and a visit to a WWII era euthanasia hospital). Very little is said about ID or Darwin's theory of evolution. Instead the focus is on the stories of academics who were purportedly denied tenure or career advancements because of their interest in ID. I blame some of the scientists allowing Ben Stein to quote them in a way that confuses the whole argument for evolution (Dawkins especially). The truth is that intelligent design is not a scientific theory in the way that Darwin's theory of evolution.

I think Ben Stein did a good job to make it entertaining, and there is also some evidence given for Intelligent Design as well as some of the implications of Darwinism (some of the negative impact it has had on the world).

3501057,5,B001BYLFFS,"I'm very proud of Ben for having the courage to make this documentary.  As someone trained to the doctorate level in the sciences, I was exposed to the indoctrination of a godless evolution, beginning with introductory biology courses my first year of undergraduate school.  I heard all the dogma concerning Darwinism; it was preached as fact and not theory, and the gaping ""holes"" in that theory were never addressed, at least to my satisfaction.  At no time, did I find it convincing as an explanation for the ""origin of species,"" and I found it unsatisfactory in explaining life as we now see it in our natural world.  The textbooks promoted the regurgitated notions of life beginning in the ancient, inchoate world from the ""primordial soup"" of water and basic elements exposed to unspecified high energy sources.  This ""soup"" was never intellectually filling; the more that I studied, the more I began to see the evidences of intelligent design.  The truth is that Science and militant commitment to Darwinism as an explanation for the origin of life has become a religion unto itself.  True science, the brand that Newton subscribed to, supports the existence of the Creator; the Creator, however, has never been subject to science.  Unfortunately, our world is now populated with a false science that arrogantly supposes, where it is only catching a glimpse of God's workmanship in creation, that each of its minutest findings promote the accomplishments of man while disproving the existence of God.  This is nothing more than a sad rebellion and the religion of free will, something more to be pitied.  When intelligence is combined with humility and an earnest quest for truth, then true science results, and this only pays tribute to the Creator.  I have never met an atheistic evolutionist who wasn't plagued by his own pride.  It is the most supreme form of arrogance to say that God does not exist.  False science is threatened by even the discussion of intelligent design (or, the existence of the Creator), because the existence of an Intelligent Designer dethrones them and the reality of the Creator involves a coming perfect judgment that they do not want to face.  No, it is better for them to work to stamp out the last seeds of Intelligent Design and its more perfect form, Creationism, than to face other possibilities.

2.  Why intelligent design scientists believe the way they do.
3.  Examples of professors who were expelled from their work because of their intelligent design views.
4.  Connection between evolutionary theory and Nazism (this is sure to rile some folks!).
5.  Stein (a Jew) visiting the Nazi death camps of World War 2 and reflecting on the atrocities performed there.

Similarly, it is not accurate to suggest that Ben Stein is presenting a conspiracy theory.  Rather, this documentary is about the quashing of academic freedom.  It represents, and correctly so, that there is a scientific theory for which there are differences of opinion in the academic community, including well educated scientists from Ivy league schools, but due to the hostile climate regarding the theory, scientists are afraid to raise any question which could be deemed a challenge to the theory, and that those who point to unanswered questions regarding the theory,  are met with the termination of their jobs, rather than a professional open debate as to the potential answers to the question.  Anyone who lives in an allegedly freethinking society should find that disturbing, regardless of your opinion on the theory of evolution, and should disfavor the suppression of open debate. Contrary to the representation of other reviews, Ben Stein specifically states in the documentary that it cannot be said that all proponents of evolution are Nazis.  To put the comment in context, a scientist who was a proponent of evolution stated that evolution would disprove religion leaving only science in its place and would end all wars.  Ben Stein reminded his audience that science, like anything, can be abused by humans, as evidenced by Nazi's inappropriate use of science to murder those deemed inferior.  Any scientist or other person should favor the dissemination of all scientific information and the promotion of open debate, even if the debate involves a minority view to which the individual does not subscribe. It is not about the existence or inexistence of god, but the necessity of academic freedom for the furtherance of a freethinking modern society.",1294531200,10,1920,5.207792207792208

His supporters are too, and they are generally irrational in their beliefs and in their behavior.  I haven't read any reviews for this film, but I know what kind of response it has probably garnered from that crowd.  They are not rational.  They are emotional.  If you don't believe me, try talking to one.  Mention the Bible, just mention it.  That being said, I'm sure my review will not get a good rating, and I'm sure there will be responses to it.  I'm not going to read them either, because those ""discussions"" are always totally unproductive and usually involve someone making a personal attack against me, my wife, or my parents.

The main thrust of the film honestly is that anyone in the education/science community who doesn't agree with Darwinian evolution is losing their job and having their character ruined.  So don't expect much credibility from the list of interviewees.  They have already been fired and slammed in their fields.

Aristotle said, ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.""  If someone can't have a discussion without becoming angry, you are wasting your time talking with them.  Ben Stein is trying to make an argument for the discussion.  Just to have the ability to have a rational, even-tempered discussion.  I will tell you from experience that the atheists I have talked with who are able to control their temper are few and far between.  Passive-aggressive attacks and veiled insults don't count.

It is my hope that fellow scientists will not continue to follow in the footsteps of those astute intellectuals who once believed the World was flat and no other viewpoint would be tolerated.

Freedom made possible the sharing/debate of ideas concerning other viewpoints/theories and ultimately helped to advance the scientific process in this Great Nation of ours. It is troubling when a simple comment on ANYTHING concerning ID garners such an outpouring of hate, ill will, and mockery especially in today's World. Just reading the comments on Amazon plainly shows outrage from certain ""Darwinists"". Maybe they feel threatened...a psychological reaction due to a loss of control. Nonetheless, the assumption of evolution negates the need for evidence and ignores the lack of evidence.

It will take a scientist with a backbone and an unfaltering sense of the scientific process. A scientist who will continue searching for the truth refusing to prop up a faulty theory, promote propaganda and/or erect walls against any who don't ""drink their cool aide"".

""They are just stupid people"" was a comment I heard far too often from the mouth of the scientist.  I have as little tolerance for this as I would from a creationist calling a scientist a heretic.  One of the lesions I learned from my father, was to never resort to name calling, it is the last defense of closed mind.  Need it be said, that one wrong does not justify another.

What was being presented in the film was not that intelligent design was the only thing that should be taught in schools, but that there are more approaches that could be considered. Some people disregard Carbon dating as a way to determine the age of things, while others insist on its accuracy.  Regardless of the debate, it should not mean the teaching Uranium Series, Lead 210, or Potassium Argon Dating be banned?

3501096,5,B001BYLFFS,"In my mind, one of the most maddening political debates ongoing in America today is the Intelligent Design argument.  On one hand, you've got the religious right pounding their Bibles and saying Creationism should be taught in school and on the other hand you've got equally fervent and aggressive atheists who, in spite of their relatively small numbers, use their iron grip on academic institutions as a political hammer to attempt to destroy any ideas and beliefs that diverge from their own both in law and in science. Here's a terrifying question: what if one side wins?  I want neither of these fanatical groups of looney toons in control.  While the academic and media dominance of liberalism has seen to it that every man, woman, and child has ""evolution is a fact"" pounded into their skulls almost form birth, Ben Stein has put together a documentary exploring the institutional persecution being perpetuated in the scientific community who themselves often complain about being persecuted for their beliefs. Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed is an exemplary documentary that finally lays out the facts of the argument in a manner that is nearly impossible to dismiss by anybody with an open mind. Yes, Stein is a good little Republican soldier and a FOX News regular, but he is also a highly intelligent and analytical man so I'll not hold those things against him. The fact is he put together a great doc that I urge each and every Atheist, Agnostic, and Christian who is willing to put an ounce of thought into their beliefs (or lack thereof) to give it a shot.  You'll learn a lot about the issues, and if nothing else, you'll gain a new perspective on the irony of hard-line Atheism's favorite loaded buzz-term: ""freedom of thought"".

Now, before you dismiss this film as a Republican droning on about God, know that the issue at hand is never about how great religion is (it is not) or whether ID should be taught in school (it should not). The issue is the systematic persecution of any scientist, no matter how accredited, who so much as mentions the words ""intelligent"" and ""design"" in the same paragraph or even appears willing to discuss the matter.  If you have ever valued freedom of speech, you will be appalled by the practices.  The very foundation of science is unfettered exploration.  If we are to continue learning about our world, no line of thinking should be outlawed.  This is basic.  Unless you can demonstrably disprove something as a 100% falsehood, it should never be taken off the table.  However, the debate on Darwinian evolution was closed by the academic powers-that-be before it even began and we are no longer allowed to scrutinize it.  It is fact and if you even look directly at it with an open mind, you lose your job and are finished as a professional. This is not science.  This is the same mindset that led to the persecution of people like Galileo and Darwin, who challenged the ""scientifically"" established ""facts"" of their own times and found some of the truth in the process.  Science cannot progress meaningfully without open minds.  Sadly, modern science is both a lucrative industry and political ideology now so the premise of expanding knowledge is no longer as important as beating the other team and making the most money.  To do that, everybody needs to be on the same team and that means any thought-process diverging from the establishment must be branded as scientific heretics and kicked out onto the margins. Expelled interviews many of the scientists on those margins (some of whom wouldn't even show their face on camera from fear of losing their jobs) and also many of the academics who put them there, including Atheist ringleader Richard Dawkins, author of the hysterically incendiary The God Delusion. Sorry to spoil it, but before the end of this film, you will see the Atheist ringleader himself admit to the possibility of Intelligent Design while being interviewed by Ben Stein.  He may have backpedaled after the fact by claiming he did not know the nature of the film he was being interviewed for, but the fact is he said it.

One more bit of groundwork here. Let me point out that ID is not in any way, shape, or form related to Creationism. Creationism is ""poof, there was life!"". ID acknowledges that evolution is indeed a natural part of our world, but explores the possibility that random genetic mutations over millions of years are not enough to design something as mechanically complicated as an aerodynamic flying life form, much less create life from scratch.  Indeed, if a series of random simplistic events were enough to create life out of methane gas and the like, why is it we can't repeat the process?  We know what the materials were to work with, so what big coincidence is going to wield a power that we can't duplicate with all our knowledge and technology after all these centuries of trying to do it on purpose? Careful.  Asking that kind of question will lose you your job if you are a science professor and you'll never get a paper published again. Stein likens this academic barrier to The Berlin Wall, which was constructed by the Soviet Union to keep unwanted democratic ideas out of their side of the city. The parallel is hard to dispute, and give Stein a lot of gas going into the finale which cuts between a speech he gave and Reagan's moment of glory in Berlin.  That's some bad stuff when these people start making Reagan look good in comparison.

 Now, while a lot of this was preaching to the choir for me, there was a bit in Expelled that some people will think went too far and they may even invoke Godwin's Law, but I found it devastating to one of Atheism's favorite arguments: that wars are all caused by religion and Hilter was a fundamentalist Christian. While I feel the doc spent too much time on the issue, I actually learned something that had been right in front of my face the whole time so that segment alone was worth brushing up on my Atheist-flaming skills.  So Hitler was hardline Christian?  Well, that's funny because is his entire Master Race idea not based on Darwinian evolution?  Don't Christians not believe in that stuff?  Yeah.  Dawkins is pretty much screwed. Stein actually tours a facility where the Nazis would evaluate the handicapped to decide whether or not they were fit to breed. If they weren't......well, you know how Hitler handled the undesirable elements under his rule. And another kicker: the idea of eugenics began here in America decades before Hitler put it into practice.  And it wasn't Christians who believed in pruning the branches of humanity to push evolution forward in this way.n At one point in the doc, Stein interviews an evolutionist who he encourages to verbally follow his ideology to it's logical conclusion.  Yeah, not so much with the sanity, there.

Expelled has Stein chasing this topic all over the place and I was extremely happy to finally see somebody put on film what I've been thinking for years.  What cracks me up is that many of the interviewees from the Darwin camp went up in arms because they didn't realize that the film they were being interviewed for was a pro-ID film. So does that mean they didn't say what they meant?  I'm not sure why that would make a difference. The film was lashed and derided by the mainstream as ""lies"" and ""propaganda"", but like the finer points of evolutionary science, no real explanation as to how is given.  Having spent years discussing this issue with people on both sides online and in person, I've found that Fundamentalists and Atheists are essentially the same creature.  When you face them with an argument they cannot counter, they simply ignore the questions and stick to name-calling and making outrageous claims off the top of their head.  One thing I can say is that Stein did read some of Darwin's writings out of sequence to make it appear as though he was saying something he was not.  That is some FOX News-style BS and the people who made this doc should be ashamed to have stooped to the same level as those they are attempting to combat by sewing disinformation. That sort of discourse assumes that we are too stupid to check facts and if your premise can't stand on it's own facts, it's time to find a new one.  And this is one point of view that can stand on it's own without that garbage, so why poison the well?

 The biggest problem here is not that Darwinists and religion exist, it is that they feel they can't co-exist. One is always attempting to wipe out the other politically. That is not democracy, that is fascism, and it's made even more ironic that they are both chucking the fascist label at each other like the metaphorical pot and kettle. The facts are that ID should never be taught in school, but mentioning it in class should not be forbidden either if the topic comes up. The Bible is primarily allegorical and it's pretty embarrassing to me that these supposedly brilliant minds can't grasp such a simple concept. Darwin was a brilliant biologist whose theories are as important as Newton's were to physics and Freud's were to psychology. However, nothing and nobody is above reproach.  If you are afraid of examining you own beliefs, be they religious or scientific, they are probably wrong, and you probably know that deep down inside. We have yet to see any evidence better then ""this bone kinda looks like that bone"" to show one animal evolving into another at a level above individual species. Until we are able to witness the progress of this process firsthand, it is not any more fact then the existence of God or aliens.  It's an intriguing idea and better then anything else we've got, but facts require proof and the funny thing about what passes for facts in this day and age is that the facts often change.  Funny thing about learning.  All I'm saying and all Expelled is saying is that scientists should be allowed to pursue any line of research they like and theorize freely without fear of losing grant money or their jobs and being blacklisted.  Both sides of every issue must be explored for any rationality to exist.  As reasonable people, is that too much to ask?

3501103,5,B001BYLFFS,I almost can't get enough of this documentary- it blows me away every time I watch it. Stein did an excellent job of introducing viewers to this frightening trend in our scientific community which unfortunately is in absolute accord with the overall anti-religious direction of American culture. The revelation that the squelching of intelligent design theory is really a fear-based reaction against the reality of God is refreshingly candid. The only possible reason I can think of for not liking this film is if you're as fear-filled an evolutionist as the ones in the film and are threatened by a reasonable (and if you'd have the integrity to assess ID unbiasedly you'd see that it IS reasonable) challenge to your theory.,1280620800,17,726,5.008264462809917
3501104,2,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein needs to learn that most of his audience aren't as smart as him, so he needs to reach out to them in a manner they could understand.  The thing about documentaries is that no matter how uninteresting or compelling they are, they usually have a theme to comprehend the viewers. For ""An Inconvenient Truth"", it's about the dangers of global warning; for ""Religuious"", it's about the falsehood of religion; for ""Sicko"", it's about the lack of universal health care. When it comes to ""Expelled"", I presume it's about blanketing Intelligence Design.

Here's the thing: what IS Intelligence Design? The movie doesn't explain what it's about, or show examples as to how it works; the movie could've show a chalkboard of numbers, at least that wouldn've been an explanation.  It took me a while after seeing the film to vaguely grasp that it might be a study or proof that some superior being created life on earth, and even then, it's a very undefined subject.  What I do understand about ""Expelled"" is that it's another religion vs. science debate.  For most of the film, it's about scientists and esteemed authors throwing around arguments about Darwinism and Creationism, how the higher-ups are trying to diminish those who try to prove evolution wrong, and at one point the film even went as far as comparing Darwinism to Nazism and how that's the future of humanity.  Wow, I really doubt the majority of the world would lead to something that extreme.

What ""Expelled"" really is is just people throwing big words at each other, without making soluble proof to support their sophisticated beliefs.  And that's the problem with this documentary: it's too high-brow for its own good.  It's also incredibly dry, and when it's advertised as a comedy of sorts, I expected some perks to keep it lively; with Ben Stein, I can't tell if he's trying to be witty or not.  He tried by adding 'funny' clips and wacky skits during his narration, but they're just there, and I don't see how most of them illustrate his overall views.  As a documentary of entertainment value, it's lacking; Michael Moore, he is not.  Moore may be exaggerating a lot of facts in his films, but he was to-the-point in what he's trying to say, and his films can be both informative AND entertaining. With this film, I felt neither enlightened or immersed by the content, just exhausted.

I have no real opinion on the movie's subject, the convoluted nature of it made it sorta difficult to form one.  But I do believe in freedom of speech.  IF there really is a force to restrict people to talk about I.D., then I don't approve of it.  People should have to express what they like to say; even if they make absurd, uncanny, and incredibly farfetched statements, they have the right to make absurd, uncanny, and incredibly farfecthed statements. If Ben Stein wanted to make a documentary about this subject, then he has the right as well.  But he should at least make it exciting.

That pondering, however, has been in the form of religion and philosophy. It has not been welcomed into the scientific community which is more interested in what can specifically be proven using math and controlled experimentation.

Enter the 21st century, where some scientists have decided to enter the variable of some type of intelligence that created the universe and life. This of course is highly controversial. This documentary was great for explaining how this line of thinking hasn't received the warm welcome that some may have hoped. Like many documentaries, I will warn you, it is definitely biased. I know that not everywhere do they treat Intelligent Design theorists as the examples in this video but it does happen (and it happens in other fields for other things too).

That there is someone to answer to about the decisions we've made in this life after we die. No, many people don't want God to exist because it means  re-evaluating their life and they're scared they might have to change something.
  The great thing is God is real whether you believe or not and so is His ""unlimited love"" (Apostle Paul) for anyone who CHOOSES to search for Him without any biases and then to build a relationship with Him. This is true even to Richard Dawkins and everyone else in our world that has ever lived, is living, and ever will live. Christianity is about a relationship, not religion and those who discover this truth are the one's whose lives are really transformed in the way Christ spoke about. Religion is a set of rules and is filled with hypocrites who don't live what they preach. Christ is a being who loves what He's created and just wants all of us to just look for Him with 100% effort. He wants all of us to be...family. That's the difference between religion and Christianity.

I love that quote, because it's an honest assessment of the root of the problem some religious folks have with science.  Scientists reject supernatural explanations for natural phenomena.  This does not mean that all scientists reject the existence of the supernatural.  Unfortunately, this film promotes that false dichotomy.

Though I believe that Ben Stein truly believes in his heart that he is fighting a good fight and unearthing a conspiracy in the scientific community, he is still ultimately wrong on those conclusions and all other accounts presented in this film.  The basic problem is that he does not see or understand the field of science as it really is.  In short, in this film, he demonstrates an all-too-common ignorance of the scientific process.  Thus, on a fundamental level, there were MANY ideas and conclusions that were wrong in this film.

Let me explain my points by highlighting a couple of ideas/conclusions presented in the film, as well as some of the obvious biases.

#1. Let's start with the title's premise of the film -- the notion that Intelligent Design proponents are 'expelled' from public universities and science classrooms -- that they are, in essence, picked on and not allowed to play the science game.  This idea that ID proponents are singled out and expelled from playing the science game is *fundamentally* wrong.  Creationism, and its reincarnate of itself, Intelligent Design, is not considered a ""competing theory"" among biologists.  They consider it long-defeated and forgotten about.

To quote a religious Evolutionary Biologist, Steven L. Peck, at Brigham young University:

""Many people think scientists are in a grand conspiracy together-that we all secretly agree on some cabalistic agenda, including, but not limited to evolution, global warming, the cell theory of organisms (it's still only a theory we are made of cells, you know, but I find the evidence compelling), etc. They then think we defend its borders against those who aren't part of the club. Well, it's sort of true. Scientists are not likely to let the new kids on the block play with the regulars until the supplicant proves him or herself in the crucible of the playing field-more on that. But conspiracy? Heavens no. Scientists are a bloodthirsty lot. Their currency of exchange is fame and glory. Eternal life in the pages of history. To have your ideas spread are the passion that motivates every scientist I know. Truth is the playing field, the goal of the game though is to get ahead; to become the next Einstein, Darwin or the professor on Gilligan's Island (The greatest scientist I know). And it is bloody. Reputations are made and broken. Pedestals are erected and smashed. Lives ruined, tenure denied, papers rocketed into the sky only to be shot down with anti-ballistic missiles in the form of data that doesn't fit your project. It is an ugly world of fierce competition. Only the fittest ideas persist.

The public picture of science is the Dog Party in the children's book Go Dog Go, up in the tree all toasting one another's success. The more accurate view of science is to move the dog party to the Roman Coliseum. Now turn them into pit bulls, Rottweilers, Doberman pinschers, and German shepherds. Maybe throw in one of those wolf hybrids if you want. Now set them at each others throats. That is science. Scientists are like a great gladiatorial arena of fighting dogs. Each scientist quickly assesses the strength of their opponent then goes for the throat. A quick kill is the surest way to dislodge a weak and insubstantial enemy. This arena is fierce and unrelentingly competitive. The best way to get ahead in the game is to focus your attack on the top dogs and take them down. If you can replace the alpha theory-hypothesis-notion with your own you have the won the contest. It is not a conspiracy, it's not a dog party, it is a Hobbesian war of all against all.

The fact is things like Evolution and Global warming have survived. Evolution has survived some of the bloodiest battles in the history of science (and I don't mean between creationists and evolutionists, I mean among evolutionists). It's as solid as anything I know. There are a few yapping toy breeds still barking at it from the outskirts of the battlefield, like ID, but the second they enter the fight, they are bitten bad and they go yelping back to the safety of public opinion's lap. In the fray itself they are seen as non-combatants. If their ideas didn't keep slipping away into the security of their masters, those ideas would be killed without mercy.""

That aforementioned quote is one of the best explanations I can invoke to accurately assess some of the religious public's problem with science.

#2.  To suggest, as Ben Stein did in this film, that an acceptance of evolutionary biology might lead to Nazism, genocide, and eugenics is not only offensive and deceitful, it is willfully ignorant and scientifically just plain wrong by a long shot.

Darwin did not propose evolution.  This was widely accepted and established before his time in the scientific community.  What Darwin did propose, however, was a *mechanism* for evolution in nature -- natural selection.  Look at the title of his famous flagship book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Origin-of-Species-by-Means-of-Natural-Selection-or-the-Preservation-of-Favoured-Races-in-the-Struggle-for-Life-1st-edition-mobi/dp/B001EW51Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1st edition) (mobi)</a>.

*Human-driven* evolution, called *ARTIFICIAL* selection, has been around and in use by all humans for millenia.  Using artificial selection to develop breeds of dogs, cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, etc. and cultivars of crops like corn and wheat have been implemented for over 5000 years. LONG before Darwin.

Killing off Jews, retarded individuals, and others during the Nazi Holocaust was a sick use of artificial selection.  Nothing to do with natural selection, aka Darwinism.  Humans breeding and culling other organisms (in this case, humans) has nothing to do with Darwinism.  All true biologists know this.  It's sad the ID proponents revert to this intellectually irresponsible tactic for bashing evolution.

It's ridiculous that the so-called expert young woman interviewed by Stein at the former concentration camps kind of shook her head, yes, when asked, if Darwinism was responsible for the sick ideas behind the camps, but she didn't even know who Malthus was.

#3.  Of course, to develop hype, Ben Stein only interviewed the most extreme and controversial evolutionary biologists out there -- foremost and namely, Richard Dawkins.  Of course, Dawkins, who is an Ontological Naturalist often tries to dissuade people from their belief in a Deity in books such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-God-Delusion/dp/0618918248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The God Delusion</a>.  But not only did Stein not interview other materialists/ontological naturalists such as Harvard biologist and Pulitzer Prize winner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naturalist-E-O-Wilson-Lord-of-the-Ants-NOVA/dp/B0019N5A98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naturalist E.O. Wilson- Lord of the Ants - NOVA</a>, who, while not being completely atheistic or agnostic, still tries to reach out to religious people to find common ground such as in his book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Creation-An-Appeal-to-Save-Life-on-Earth/dp/0393330486/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth</a>.  But, neither did Stein interview any of the many prominent evolutionary biologists who are religious or sympathetic to religion, like Kenneth Miller, Daniel Fairbanks, or Francisco Ayala.  Again, Stein creates a false dichotomy that is not accepted by most scientists, especially religious scientists.

#4.  While attacking Evolutionary biology, this film does not present a case for Intelligent Design.  It does not say anything about what Intelligent Design proposes.  Only that it was 'treated unfairly' and goes yelping back into the safety of the kinder nonscientific public's lap.  Hence, this film.  If you want to be informed about what Intelligent Design actually is, then watch the PBS/NOVA film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judgment-Day-Intelligent-Design-on-Trial/dp/B000YY6VIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judgment Day - Intelligent Design on Trial</a>, where a conservative, religious, Bush-appointed federal judge proclaims Intelligent Design as not science.  After all, PBS is funded by the people and made for the people.  ""Expelled"" was funded by cdesign proponentsists and made for cdesign proponentsists.  Don't believe me?  Look at what the ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" section of this web page reveals -- almost entirely Lee Strobel, Michael Behe, and other pro-ID films and books.  How can you profess to understand (and subsequently bash) evolution if you don't read any of it?

#5.  Stein constantly refers to Evolutionary Biology as ""Darwinian Gospel"" or ""Darwinian Doctrine"" throughout the duration of the film.  Evolution is not a belief system.  I don't 'believe' in biology.  I believe in God, and I *accept* the overwhelming evidence for evolutionary biology.  And like 99.9999% of all biologists, I accept it as the thriving, legitimate science that it is, full of useful predictive power, and ID has no predictive power or anything useful whatsoever.  Accepting and believing connote two very different things.  And Stein knows that.

They don't want to allow those who disagree with their theories of Darwinism and evolution and to have a voice in the debate. In fact, they insist that there is no debate, only consensus. However, this documentary proves otherwise.

Stein points out how that atheism, Darwinism, and evolutionary theory conspire to tamp down belief in a Creator. He shows how that this kind of thinking led to the eugenics movement, and contributed to the Jewish holocaust in Germany.

Science is objective, but people forget that scientists are not innately objective, at least no more so than anyone else.  As a psychologist I am aware that extreme intelligence does not protect one from insecurity. The insecurity creates a need to be right, because criticism of their ideas or position on an issues is experienced as a personal attack. In fact, people who are extremely gifted in a specific area, but who have fragile egos, often form their identity upon their area of giftedness.  Such individuals have no tolerance for criticism, and often experience extreme rage when faced with people who question them.  This is referred to as narcissistic wounding; google the term for a much better description than I am offering here  Of course, not all scientists are these fragile wounded people, but I would hazard a guess that many are, especially if they were teased, ostracized, or rejected by other children and adolescents due to their extreme intelligence -- or they were praised for their intelligence to the point that it became the foundation of their worth.

3501169,1,B001BYLFFS,"Wow. This one was tough to get through.

Ben Stein stars in this goofy, Glenn Beck-worthy 'documentary' about three college professors, a scientific journal editor and an astrophysicist who were supposedly hounded out of their jobs because of a belief in/willingness to talk about ""intelligent design' (read: 'fancy creationism').

There are so many problems with this. First of all, when you slow the movie down so you can see what these people actually have degrees in, you understand why they shouldn't be discussing 'ID' or evolution- they aren't qualified to comment! Here are a couple of them:
Richard Sternberg was the editor of a scientific journal published by the Smithsonian. Somehow, he got a paper which advocated ""ID"" into a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It was published more than six months after he *resigned* from his position, though he continued on at the Smithsonian in some kind of research capacity for three more years. Hmmm... Ben left that part out...
Caroline Crocker was a part-time cell-biology lecturer at George Mason U. and has a phD in 'immunopharmacology' which, I learned, is the study of drugs that affect the immune system. Why is she pontificating on ""ID"" in a college classroom? But apparently, she wasn't fired- her contract wasn't renewed. Oops; Ben left that one out of the movie, too.
Robert J. Marks, who, if I remember correctly, had a degree in engineering, used the servers at Baylor University to host an ""ID"" website- that's a big no-no, as it implied that Baylor U. endorsed the views being presented. There's nothing shocking about the fact that they asked him to take it down and return some grant money. Apparently, they don't like their professors dabbling in lies.

Not one of these people ought to have touched on ""ID"" in their professional lives. As a religious matter, this is best left at home. I would lose my job for pushing my atheism on people at work, so religious people ought to face the same consequences.
Not to mention that a science class and a peer-reviewed science journal are the worst possible places for discussion of religious matters. So even though these people didn't actually get fired, it would be ok if they had, because they weren't doing their jobs. I mean, 'intelligent design' isn't even pseudo-science; it's garbage.

Interspersed with theses sob stories (or lies, if you prefer) are bits of interviews with guys like Richard Dawkins and Michael Shermer- Dawkins in particular is badly lit (to make him look evil, no doubt), and his answers are cut to pieces and reassembled so as to make him appear stupid; but Richard Dawkins was a Professor at Oxford for many years; I doubt very much that he is stupid. Christopher Hitchens appears for two seconds towards the beginning- the rest of that interview would be interesting to see. It's probably hidden in Stein's basement so no one will ever see the pounding he got that day.

Then there's the obligatory nazi reference as evolutionists are compared with Hitler and his henchmen. Talk about hackneyed! As if the twisted racial theories of the Third Reich had anything to do with Darwinian natural selection. Darwin stated that species adapt and change over time because of environmental pressures and competition for food, mates, etc. How nazism could be extrapolated from that I'll never know.

This is one of the most thoroughly dishonest 'documentaries' I've seen in a long time. So it's not surprising to find out that many of the 'pro-Darwin' interviewees were misled about the nature of the film in order to get the interview. The producers even lied to The Killers to get one of their songs into the movie. All in all, it's a fail for Ben Stein, who is smarter than this and ought to know better.

3501172,4,B001BYLFFS,"I believe this film gives a great message to the future of the scientific community,even if at times it lays it out a bit thick.
When we close our minds to possiblities and persecute individuals based on their beliefs,it's time for a change.
History should have at least taught us this much by now.
It's a bit sad to see this game now played at the opposite end of the court,with Neo-Darwinist being the hard headed biggots that used to (and still do) populate the Christian orthodoxy. When we can stop our petty academic arguements and start realizing this absolute mystery we live in,then maybe we can come closer together and start to really explore the problems.
It's a pipe dream,but hey it's a good one!

Perhaps the most shocking part of this documentary is the final discussion between Ben Stein and Richard Dawkins.
Dawkins can hardly get through the interview without stumbling over himself the whole time. He even admits (and probably much to his regret now), that intelligent design could have happened,just not through means of ""God"".
He then gives his science fiction explanation (which in all honesty could be true as well).
I just find it a bit hypocritical that Dawkins believes we should give up our primitive superstitions,yet then gives us a 21st century superstition of how life may have come to be.

I think the biggest merit of this film is that even if you're not a proponnet of Intelligent Design,it does make a very valid point of not slipping into bad habits of our histories past.
What Religion has entailed at it's worst to the world could become a mere shadow of what evils and biggotry science could be capable of if we use it to unjustly persecute people.",1264982400,11,1687,4.715254237288136
3501173,5,B001BYLFFS,"This documentary has three things that set it apart and make it interesting:

1. Ben Stein's dry humor.
2. Its take on the free speech aspect of Intelligent Design.  The main point of the movie is that Intelligent Design is being suppressed in the academia, not that intelligent Design is right (although the movie certainly does attempt to portray that as well).
3. It gives its opponents plenty of speaking time.  Rickard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and others are given uninterrupted segments during the movie to espouse their views on the matter, giving the audience a look at the opposition.

If the idea of Intelligent Design intrigues you, or if you are not quite sure how life was supposed to have 'just happened' this movie would be a good bet.

Although definitely a documentary and not an action movie, Ben Stein keeps it entertaining with his humor and moving for those interested in the subject.

3501175,5,B001BYLFFS,Economist/Actor/Speech writer/Political Commentator/Game Show Host Ben Stein makes an incredible case against the blind rush of the scientific community to accept the illogical faith based theory of Darwinian organic evolution.  Many evolutionist paint anyone who opposes or questions the theory of evolution as being religious fanatics or simply uninformed or uneducated.  Rather Stein shows us that those who question evolution are really some brilliantly sound scientific minds who view the same scientific facts that evolution supporters use in another way.  Their arguments are just as scientifically valid and are - quite frankly - more scientically sound.  He helps us see that the scientific community is really become more of a political action committe than a real objective science-based group seeking real truths.  The scientific community push their religion of atheism as science.  Especially disturbing is the history lesson Stein gives us of the results of accepting the path we are being pushed down in our country - the USA.

3501177,1,B001BYLFFS,"A lot of Americans like the idea of the 'commonsense' outsider reducing complex issues with an 'aww shucks' homespun wit, and I'm sure that's part of why so many people enjoyed this documentary.  In short, Ben Stein plays the role of Omniscient Jones, questioning the presumed biases of the ""evolutionist establishment"" and, in the process, making a few scientists look uncomfortable with his theological questions.  But the documentary never directly addresses WHY Intelligent Design is not scientific.  If Stein and his producers had taken a moment to define science, the ID 'controversy' they fabricate would unravel before the viewers' eyes.

Simply put, science is more than just theory and passive observation.  As Karl Popper (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popper-Selections/dp/0691020310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popper Selections</a>) explains, science is the process of risky prediction and testing.  Popper referred to this as the principle of 'falsification'; unlike philosophical or metaphysical pursuits, scientific hypotheses are framed in a way to make them refutable.  Hypotheses that survive systematic testing are retained (and re-tested), and the hypotheses that fail are discarded or reworked.

So the obvious challenge for ID advocates is to produce testable hypotheses that derive from their theories.  What risky predictions could we systematically test?  If ID is false, how could we refute it?  Such questions are the essence of science, and yet nowhere in the documentary does Stein even begin to wrestle with such difficulties.  Instead, the basic principles of science are completely ignored, and the viewer is led to believe that the scientific community is jealously excluding ID advocates because ... well, just because.  (It's an elitist/atheist/nazi conspiracy, or something like that.)

Now, having said that, ID is not necessarily worthless.  Even Popper himself points to the usefulness of some untestable theories (e.g., Alfred Adler's psychological theory of personality).  Popper also talks about how even myths can eventually be subjected to scientific rigor; but ID does not rise to that level.  Thus, ID should NOT be taught in science courses, but may have an academic home in philosophy (e.g., aesthetics), metaphysics, or religion.

As a takeaway analogy, teaching ID in science classes is like teaching numerology in math classes.  Sure, numerology and math both deal with numbers, but it is a category error to classify them together.",1263686400,9,2533,5.797297297297297

This video makes one of the best cases for censorship and suspension of First Amendment rights that I've ever encountered.  But, that's not the way I ""roll,"" that's the way that Ben Stein and the far-right, religious, wingnuts ""roll.""

For someone who appears to have a bit of knowledge (mostly trivia, such as that featured in ""Win Ben Stein's Money""), Ben Stein sure says and does the most moronic things.  That's what is so great about living in a somewhat free society, people can - and quite often do - say the damndest (and most foolish) things.  For all the folks out there who think that Bennie Boy is a real thinker/philosopher, and feel he is a wise man before whom they should bow and scrape, and to whom they should listen attentively, I have one thing to say: in one of the letters he wrote and posted on his website approximately four to five years ago, he wrote that George ""Dubya'"" Bush was the greatest President in U.S. history.  If this fact does not raise questions in your mind as to this man's enormous ignorance regarding issues of importance, and a complete lack of observational skills, then you might want to do a genealogy search to see if you are related to him, ergo share his genes (including those responsible for low intelligence, poor insight, inability to remain focused, lack of understanding, faulty comprehension etc., etc. ad infinitum).

But, ""Ben-bashing"" aside, if someone could pose a serious, fact-based, logical argument for ""Intelligent Design,"" I'd be willing to listen.  But, considering what I've heard from the vacuous proponents of this misguided concept, I won't be required to listen for a long, LONG time, if ever.  Still, I will defend their right to show how foolish they are.  However, I feel that subjecting anyone, children or adults, to unsubstantiated ""religious doctrine and non-factual speculation,"" while ignoring the preponderance of salient, verifiable facts that have been obtained through the scientific method of observation, study, independent duplication/replication of test results etc. is wasteful of said children's and adult's time, as well as being cruel, and even bordering on criminal, in my opinion.

Bennie Boy wants us to seriously consider the possibility of intelligent design that has been exhorted by the same group of tired, old, religious, white men who threw people in jail, tortured them, and threatened them with execution for daring to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun, when these oh so intelligent and enlightened men had it on ""God's authority"" that the opposite was actually the case.  Bennie Boy also wants us to share his umbrage over the fact that teachers have been fired from their positions at various colleges and universities for teaching (""preaching"" is more likely) the ID theory.  These same people would suggest that one man, along with a few members of his family, built a boat large enough to hold two of every single creature that existed on this planet - and they will do so with straight faces.

Their firings were unfortunate (for them), but they should have known that to offer such tripe at an institution of higher learning would be met with something less than exuberant praise...then again, if they are devoid of the minimal intelligence required to recognize their foolish ideas as...well, foolish, before the fact, I guess one could not expect them to be savvy enough to realize that repeating these foolish ideas would be unwise.  Ironically, it would appear that they ended up serving as proof that Darwin was right about evolution: the strong survive, and the weak/stupid - well, they spout foolishness, fall by the societal wayside, and wander about in the darkness of ignorance.

3501181,5,B001BYLFFS,"I loved this movie and think it is important and powerful, I also think it's misunderstood.  IMO Ben Stein is arguing for the middle ground, a world of debate in which the possibility of a ""God"" is not excluded in favor of more scientific possibilities, like aliens or crystals or pure chaotic happenstance.  Ben's arguments come off as pro creationist purely because as illustrated by the movie the ""pure science"" rhetoric is so exclusionary it doesn't leave room for compromise.
 It seems an awful lot of people were put off by his NAZI arguments but they are purely and simply misunderstanding its use.  It's not a trumped up scare tactic but a logical look at one potential possibility of scientific argument gone wrong.  If the population of a nation like The USA is educated to believet hat ""science is truth"", and science doesn't allow for the possibility of God, even in intelligent debate, then the population of the USA is being taught there is no God(or at least not one intelligent people can discuss).

3501183,1,B001BYLFFS,"""Science is a philosophy of discovery, intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance""--Neil Tyson, astrophysicist. He is right and nothing in this ""documentary"" shows otherwise. Stein's main argument, that banning intelligent design from the science classroom is an assault on academic freedom, is absurd. Should economics departments be required to teach Marxism as an alternative theory? All ideas are not equally valid, as one would hope a conservative like Stein would understand. The point, made relentlessly by biologists such as Ken Miller, is that intelligent design is not science. I mention Miller, because as a Catholic, he refutes the assertion Stein assumes as fact-that there is no place for religious scientists in biology. (It is worth mentioning that Francis Collins, also a devout scientist, has denounced intelligent design in his best-selling book The Language of God).

The movie gets more ridiculous as it goes on. As I suspected he would, Stein tried to blame Darwinism  for the Holocaust. A number of self-appointed experts go on about the importance of religion to a moral society-which has zero to do with the question of whether evolution is true. I urge pro-ID people to read Ken Miller and also to go to expelledexposed.com for the truth behind the alleged firings. Believe nothing in this ""documentary.""",1263168000,7,1335,5.2924528301886795

3501199,5,B001BYLFFS,"First, let me start by saying that this is a documentary, and because it's a documentary, it's a film about science, given life and fame by one of the greatest intellectuals on Earth; Ben Stein.  I've always respected the man for his intelligence and his work, and now, I respect him even more.

Over the course of this movie, Ben Stein travels all over the world, meeting other academia and speaking to them.

He makes no claims and no assumptions in these dialogues.  In fact, he frequently asks his questions in a way that seems to favor the established approach to science, and you can hardly blame him.  It's easy to accept what you've been told, without looking for alternate explanations, and that's basically what this movie is all about.

Although Ben Stein asks the questions, the words we hear on screen aren't his, but rather, the words of other scientists.  They're the ones who make the claims.  They explain the things that have happened to them in their lives.  We hear about people who've lost jobs, tenure, and credibility because they preferred to take a fresh approach to scientific study; intelligent design.

We also hear the words of other scientists; evolutionists and critics of intelligent design, and their own words tell us the story of their lives and their viewpoints.

It seems that Ben Stein is convinced that the best way to understand someone is to look at them and talk to them.  I agree with that, and fortunately, this film makes nothing up.  None of the facts or quotes brought forth in this movie are fictional, or made up to encourage a reaction.  Nothing said in this film is false.  Hard to listen to, maybe, but not false.

The spirit of science, as it was originally-envisioned, was the spirit of understanding the world rationally, by a careful and objective study of evidence, so as to come to an understanding based on facts, rather than based on what someone else tells you.  Originally, that ""someone else"" was generally a priest, rabbi, or other religious person, and I can't deny that lots of religious people have made mistakes in the past; even abused their authority.  However, as this film illustrates, it can be dangerous to closed-mindedly side with anything or anyone; even other scientists.

What's really dangerous, however, is fear.  Ben seems to see a conspiracy here, though he never says it, or anything, directly.  I don't.  What I see is a lot of scientists who are terrified and desperate to protect themselves from reprisals.  They're scared they won't be taken seriously by the public if they give credence to intelligent design, so they don't, and they criticize and discredit anyone who does.  At the point when people give in to fear, an unspoken surrender occurs, and the real search for knowledge ends.

This is what Stein is really making an effort to prevent, whether he knows it or not; not the victory of one side over another in a scientific debate, but the freedom of people to search for knowledge using the methods they think will produce results, without being harrassed and insulted for it, and without being afraid.

In my own life, I've had many debates with many kinds of people, and I've learned not to say anything in a debate unless (A.) you can back it up, and (B.) you think it's important.  Stein seems to follow both of these rules, but there's something else I've learned in my debates.  Generally, if a debater doesn't have a well-considered view of their own position, there are signs that can be noticed and taken advantage of.  Nervousness, a dry mouth, rapid motions of the eyes and changes in posture, and in advanced stages, insults and an attempt to discredit the other person's argument instead of backing up their own.

Maybe not every Darwinist uses these tactics to defend themselves, but most of the ones that I've debated with do.  They assume their argument is well-supported, so they make no effort to support it, and instead, focus on tearing the arguments of others down.

The honest truth is, no one can prove how the universe came into being, or how the first living thing was created, and because no one can prove it, most people seem content to leave it at that, as if the origin of life wasn't important at all to us, or to our understanding of existence.  Thanks to this, popular scientists have yet to even propose theories of any sort that would explain the origins of life, or the start of existence, regardless of how essential that information is.  Because they have no theories about it, their only means of defending themselves on this issue are either to ignore it, like most people, or to try to force everyone who disagrees with them to abandon their theories as well, which is something like fixing a leaky tire by putting holes in all the others.  Sure, you may get a less lopsided ride than before, but it doesn't solve your problem.

This movie is considered contraversial as well, because it mentions nazism as being linked to eugenics, and also mentions that eugenics was linked to Charles Darwin and Planned Parenthood.  It doesn't use this to attempt to incriminate Darwin, or to incriminate America, which is a suitably subtle tack to take in a movie about facts, and I appreciated that.  Let those who want to learn the truth learn it on their own, now that they've been given a few facts to guide them.

Eugenics is a faulty concept, and it's particularly faulty when it becomes policy for governing people.  Any policy that involves the killing of inconvenient people is faulty, because the acceptance of people who are weak and inconvenient is, if I'm not mistaken, still engraved into the Statue of Liberty, even if you don't consider the preservation of innocent life to be important.  Murder is still murder.  That's not natural, or a part of life.  It's an action that one person decides to perpetrate on another.

Still, many have reacted as if Stein was calling Darwin a nazi, and he certainly was not.  There's rather a vast difference between believing that weak animals will wind up dying under stress, and actively killing people based on that philosophy.  Darwin never tried to force people to follow his way of thinking, or kill people who were too weak to support themselves.  He never oppressed anyone, in fact, which is a mistake that many Darwinists seem to be making now.  In fact, he once said that if the suffering of the poor is due, not to nature, but to our own institutions, then great is our sin.

The reason why nazism is brought up is not to denounce Darwin, but rather, to prove that any intelligent idea can become monstrous if people get carried away with it, and start to interpret it falsely, as the Nazis did, and it's a point worth making.  Questioning brilliant ideas is important, but questioning our own approach to them is even more essential.  We all need to look within ourselves a little more often, and evaluate whether our approach is really the best one.

At the end of it all, if you're the kind of person who, like myself, is eager for facts, and generally wants to learn, you might very well get something out of this documentary.  If you feel you've been oppressed by others in the past, and that the refusal to listen to evidence has impacted your life, you may find this documentary encouraging, because it will remind you that you're not alone.

However, if you've made the decision to hold one specific viewpoint, regardless of what evidence is brought before you, and if you'd rather shout Mister Stein down as a liar, rather than as an impartial observer, then I'm afraid it would be a waste of your time to watch this film.  You won't get anything out of it.

Science is about having a mind open to the true facts, studying those facts, and drawing conclusions based on them, or at least, it used to be.  I think that's as far into the subject of this movie as I need to go.  Personally, I thought that it was one of the best documentaries I've seen in recent years because of its willingness to be openminded and discuss the issues that scientists face.

Aside from all this, I found the film mostly well-designed, with one exception.  I'm afraid that some of the cinematography a bit questionable.  The film regularly zips back and forth into clips from old videos and films, which I found a bit distracting.  Still, I can't give it whole point down just for that.  Ben Stein is smart enough, fast enough, and he's got the guts.  Guts like those deserve that fifth star, regardless of what else is involved.",1261958400,7,8505,4.684848484848485

This shouldn't be in a ""documentary"" category.  It should under ""religion,"" with a synopsis describing it as a story of faith about a godly man named Ben.

3501204,3,B001BYLFFS,"I watched Expelled last night, and thought Ben Stein made his points well, although his objectivity is staged. Stein's argument was too simple: Yes, we do not know how life started from no life, and so therefore we should allow the idea that a creator, or intelligence, designed life. That's it. But Stein does not dig further, rather he plays a Michael Moore type. For example: Stein interviewed Dawkins and did not refer to how Dawkins qualified the Judeo-Christian God as not possible in the equation. And that's what is missing. If Stein would have said we don't know how life originated, but we can dismiss the man-made religions, and at best say we are ignorant, but we should not discount that there may have been an intelligent force that started life...well, fair enough. Yet Stein wants to use a form of reductio ad absurdum, in this context, stating that 'your theories are implausible so mine must be allowed'. ( Watch Penn & Teller's 'BS!' episode on Creationism)

Stein was being relatively fair until he made the fallacy of the atheist-genocide argument (whether or not Hitler truly believed in Christianity or used it as demagoguery is not as relevant as the fact the German nation was Christian, and Stein lost his objectivity when he made the Darwin/Nazi comparison). Stalin, Mao, even Hitler followed no God, but they did not act out of a belief in atheism, but rather out of fantacism propelling communism and some evil form of anti-Semitic militarism.

Why blame Christianity for the Inquisition or Manifest Destiny, Islam for 9/11, or atheism for Stalinism or communism? Did the Inquisition and 9/11 derive from a belief in religion? Did communism result from atheism? Did Marx think: Aha! There is no God, communism derives from this, and maybe someday a dictator will start putting people in gulags and killing! Atheists and religious followers are equally capable of good and evil. Stein's attempt to discount science and promote reason is incomplete, and this is why the documentary interested but did not satisfy.",1261526400,4,2040,4.979472140762463

3501216,1,B001BYLFFS,"Knowing that I am religious studies major, my sister came to me with this documentary, EXPELLED, and told me that I simply must watch it. I asked her what it was about and all she could tell me was, ""It's funny, trust me.""

I started the movie without any idea of what it was going to be about, only that it probably would involve some religious topic of a sort. Even fifteen minutes into the movie, I had no idea what the point of it all was supposed to be. Now, only minutes after I've watched the credits roll, I'm still unsure if any drastic points were even fully proposed.

At the start of it, Ben Stein (the most unlikely of hosts to tackle a documentary) seems to postulate a problem inherent in the academic community, where the mere utterance of the Intelligent Design Theory is grounds for suspension and, in some cases, loss of tenure and a job. If that was all this documentary had to say, I would have been fully behind it. I don't think people of any faith or belief should be fired on the basis of religion, at least given the circumstances in the film. But the point sort of ends there. There's no follow-up to any of it, because Mr. Stein will be spending the next hour-and-a-half taking shots at an institution that--as evidenced by how he behaves in the film--is way over his head.

It's after this introduction of various professors, who've been fired for their job for committing the sin of merely mentioning intelligent design in the classroom or on paper (though I suspect the circumstances were exaggerated here), that Stein begins his trek across the world to search for answers to...something.

He starts by interviewing a series of random doctors with PhD's in rather impressive fields: from mathematics to nuclear biology to philosophy. All of them focus in on evolution, claiming that it is, in the Darwinian sense, flawed, full of holes, and ""a room full of smoke."" They all also seem to agree on the fact that because of these flaws in the theory, intelligent design has a place in modern science. And this is where the movie started to lose me.

The theory of intelligent design is based in religion. There is nothing on Earth that occurs naturally that even so much as hints at the slightest possibility that we were created by a higher power. That is unless you are a close follower of Erich von Daniken's work, in which case it isn't a ""god"" you're speaking of, just another hyper-evolved race that was subject to Darwinism, as well. But, even with all that aside, if there was some kind of rational, scientific and observable fact that these proponents of the Intelligent Design Theory can attest to, which could presumably change our minds and allow the subject to be discussed widely, it is never once mentioned in this documentary. Not once.

If there is indeed such blatant empirical data out there that supports the argument for ID--the argument upon which this ENTIRE documentary is based upon--it appears that Ben Stein thought it irrelevant to his overall point, which continues to degrade more and more as the film progresses.

EXPELLED then goes on to vilify everything connected to the theory of evolution, from Darwin to Dawkins. The film actually goes so far as to discuss a world in which there is no religion, which playfully likens atheists who embrace Darwinism to Hitler and his eugenics campaign, which is absolutely insulting in the highest sense.

There is absolutely no objectivity anywhere in this film. Just when you think they're looking at a different point of view by bringing Richard Dawkins in to be interviewed, Ben Stein immediately begins to snidely ridicule his guest for his way of thinking, asking juvenile questions concerning the origin of man, all of which were answered by Dawkins in the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-God-Delusion/dp/0618918248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The God Delusion</a>, sitting on the table between them. There is no respect for Dawkins here, and Stein goes about twisting the words of what was said to make it sound like they were in agreement with each other, when that couldn't be farther from the truth (if Stein had bothered to read the book). It's so pathetic to watch, and I praise Dawkins for showing so much patience to a man who thinks he's asking tough question, but is really reiterating the same argument that's been repeated for centuries. Just because we do not know how life started, doesn't mean one can place just anything there at the beginning.

Mr. Stein seems to forget that just because he played the part of a teacher in a movie, doesn't make him qualified to argue with a man who has a doctorate in the subject they're discussing.

Additionally, never mind the fact that Stein brought the author of the laughable ""counterargument"" to Dawkins' book to be interviewed, the man whose answer to THE GOD DELUSION was a 100 page essay on an unrelated topic.

This film is insulting for a plethora of reasons, the greatest of which is its presumption that the subject matter it's tackling is of any consequence. Because this film isn't about educational or religious freedom, it's about how Ben Stein is right and the rest of the world is not. It's about how atheists are robbing people of their livelihood and, in some cases, their lives. It's about how religion is the right way, and how anything else is but a step away from Nazism.

Personally, I think all possibilities should be discussed. I think the idea of life originating elsewhere (i.e. von Daniken's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chariots-of-the-Gods/dp/0425166805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chariots of the Gods</a>) is a very romantic point of view, and should people want to pursue such a line of thinking, I'm all for it. But hopefully, in the future, this will be covered with much less mockery and perhaps a quantum of respect for the opposing side. And let us hope that Ben Stein will be the last man that we call to to spearhead such a subject.",1261440000,5,6033,4.92133726647001

Scientists in this country can lose their jobs if they speak out on evidence against evolutionary theory...why?  It is a proven fact that evolutionists hold to their dogma and do their best to humiliate those who speak out on their pet theory...again, why?  The answer is that evolutionary theory is NOT as codified in fact as evolutionists want us to believe that it is, and their rants are the ways in which they PROTECT their pet theory from being found out.

Food for thought: if the theory really was as sound factually as evolutionists claim, then it wouldn't need to be protected...the facts of nature would protect it.

3501219,3,B001BYLFFS,"It seems to me most of the reviewer here (even some of the positive ones) haven't actually seen the movie.  If they had, then they might realize that their emotionally-charged response actually supports the premise of the documentary.  Some of them don't seem to have even read or followed the debate since the Scopes monkey trial.

As Stein clearly brings out in his film, this is more about a clash between sociopolitical worldviews, than about science or psuedo-science (on both sides of the debate).  The debate here is not between evolution and creationism as some reviewers seem to think, even after allegedly seeing the film.  It has nothing to do with whether Christians believe in evolution as a process or not (again, it seems some people are more hung up on their animosity towards a religious group).  The question raised is not whether Darwinism explains the origins of species, but whether it can satisfactorily explain the origin of life.  Stein investigates and demonstrates this by exploring the complexity of the cell through entertaining animation and pallatable scientific explanation.  His conclusion is that Darwin's theories are useful more in explaining the reduction of life on the planet, but not its origin: simple processes causing changes over time do not explain the jump from inorganic to organic matter.  When he confronts respected scientists, their theories range from inexplicable crystals to alien seeding, which brings him full circle to the original accusations of academic hypocrisy.  Nobel prize winners can subscribe to theories about aliens, but allowing a margin of acceptance for a concept of Divine creation--for which the film presents no sectarian bias--is career suicide for scientists.  In fact, the academic who lost his job at the beginning (which catapaulted Stein into this investigation) wasn't even a believer, he merely published someone else's article on Intelligent Design in a peer-reviewed journal and paid the consequences for it.  Even worse, institutions tried to deny these were the reasons for termination even though there was documentation to prove it.

Some people think Stein goes too far by following Darwinism through Eugenics to the Holocaust.  This is more personally motivated, being Jewish, and he does give a disclaimer about that and also acknowledges that Darwinism does not necessarily equate to Nazism.  This section merely addresses Stein's curiosity about the benefits of a Darwinistic society over a religious one, since in his interview, Dawkins makes clear that is his ultimate goal.  Again, the focal point is the actual sociopolitical collide which still seems to be over the heads of some reviewers.  On one side, ID proponents are criticised for trying to force religion in science classes, whereas on the other side a bestselling author makes no effort to hide his desire to erradicate religion, yet receives no criticism.  Still, some will find the movie flawed here, and also just because its the same style as other notorious documentaries like Farenheit 911 or Religulous.  Stein does, however, present a more balanced spectrum of authorities and arguments on both sides than Bill Maher did in Religulous, who chose to focus on small, unheard of organizations to make his case.  Stein's subjects are published authors, reknowned scientists, and yes, also prominent proponents of Intelligent Design.  Their biases are acknowledged just as openly as their credentials.  While better than some, it was entertaining and engaging for a documentary; a good movie if not a great one.

Finally, in evaluating this review, remember the question is ""Was this review helpful to you?""  If the reviewer just rambled on about their own beliefs and didn't even address the content of the film, then please don't select Yes or No just because you agree with their beliefs.

3501221,1,B001BYLFFS,"I saw the movie on Showtime recently. I think Ben Stein forgot what science is. Science studies the natural world.

Anything that brings in a need for an ""Intelligent Designer"" (whatever that may be), is no longer science, but becomes something ""supernatural"". I don't see how you can compare the two, regardless what you think of evolution.",1260835200,5,341,4.982456140350878
3501222,2,B001BYLFFS,"I give this ""film"" two stars for the simple reason that it is a great piece of pure propaganda and nothing more. It is, as many have stated, an insult to the intelligence of everyone or watches and can stomach through it, be they religious believer or not. Ben Stein doesn't know anything about science nor do the makers of this film. It is not just that they don't understand evolution, they don't understand the scientific method. Something isn't true or not because of the moral implications of it being true, that is basic logic. If the Nazis used evolution to justify the holocaust(which they didn't) it doesn't make it not true! If I use relativity theory to justify murder, that doesn't mean gravity isn't true! People use God to justify murder, doesn't make God not true. Ben Stein states that evolution doesn't explain gravity and other scientific subjects. Yes, because evolution describes the origins of the various species, it doesn't pretend to explain a field entirely seperate from itself! Then there is the fact that there was more to these cases of these scientists supposedly fired. It is an utter travesty in the 21st century that this movie is taken seriously. Also left unexplained is the supposed designer. A designer will have to be more complex then his designed cause. In fact, scientists featured in this film were EXPELLED from screenings. How ironic. Future generations will look back at this movie and wonder what the people of our time were thinking. This movie was based purely on pushing creationism, nothing more.

  As I said before, one of the main problems with this film is that it does not understand the fact that something is not true or not because of the implications of it being true or not. For example, in its' attempts to connect the Nazis with evolution, it does not understand that if some individuals used Darwin to promote Nazism does not mean that Evolution or Natural Selection or to use the term it uses throughout the film, Darwnism, is not true. At best it is an argument why it should not be true or believed to be true but not on the question is it true or not. For example, if belief in quantum mechanics led to someone committing violence against another, that doesn't make quantum mechanics true or not. If a Christian commits violence, it does not make Christianity untrue. Ironically in its' attempt to argue against evolution based on some who might have believed in it using it as a justification for the Nazi regime, it ignores the fact that while many Christians opposed the Nazis, some though unfortnately supported and even helped vote them into office in 1933. It ignores the fact that Germany in 1933 was heavily religious (much more then today). That of course does not make Christianity untrue, just as evolution is not untrue because of some of the actions of some who might have believed in it or took actions by misinterpeting it to justify their actions, as some individuals have done with the Christian religion.

The film while a supposed critique of evolution does not touch on that subject. Its' criticisms when it deals with the actual subject matter of science is critiques on abiogensis, the origins of life. But, evolution is true or not based on its' own evidence, not on where the origins of life came from. They are two different fields of biology. For example, it is well known that there are electrons in atoms but the idea that matter is composed of strings is very much still debated. That matter is composed of string or not doesn't mean that atoms don't have electrons. One is settled science and one is not. Second, any supposed designer of life begs the question who is this designer. If it is a deity, then where did this deity come from. If the answer is it is a matter of faith then one must ask why should science be involved in matters of faith? If the supposed answer to a scientific question is one that creates more problems then the supposed solution, is it a good scientific explanation? Second, if the supposed designer is an alien being or race then who again (like the deity) caused or created them? But those who support ID for the most part don't take seriously the idea that life was started by alien beings. Like most ID supporters (though not all) they believe that the earth and life was created about or less then 10,000 years ago. Expelled is a movie that wishes to promote a view of the earth being 10,000 years old or less but doesn't want to say it directly. Those who view the film are much more likely to believe in a ""Young Earth"" then the US population at large. So, the language of Intelligent Design is used to appeal to more Americans then it would if it would just say the earth is less then 10,000 years old.

Evolution itself, like any science, does not deal with the subject of evolution. It only deals with observations and other tools of science. Something that doesn't use a scientific approach isn't science even if it is by chance true. If a designer cannot be tested and gives a solution to a problem (where does the designer come from for instance) more complicated then the problem itself there is no scientific reason to believe in it.

The film in a pre-screening ironically expelled one of the pro-evolutionist scientists that it had interviewed for the film. So much for irony. Dr. PJ Myers was made to leave the screening of the film though he had reserved seating and gave his and all other members of his party, accurate names.
Dr. Myers is one of the scientists (along with Dr. Richard Dawkins) that the producers of the film tricked by misleading them it was differing kind of documentary.

This movie lies about the Miller experiment in the 1950s that produced amino acids of a simulated early earth. The film simply says the experiment ""failed."" While the chemicals and the atmosphere was more complex then the 1950s experiment, modern experiments with a more complex atmosphere that simulates an early earth have created amino acids. In fact, this shows that the creation of amino acids is pretty common. In fact we know this to be true because amino acids that are from outer space have been found.

Ben Stein and his fellow Intelligent designers try to pretend that they could just as easily be talking about aliens as a deity but they mock a scientist who proposed that life could be seeded by aliens. Stein also mocks in the movie and post interviews, Dr. Richard Dawkins, who was asked by Stein if there was a designer what did he believe the designer to be like. Dawkins said aliens was most likely designer but again, there would have to be a natural cause for even that kind of alien designer. Dawkins did not believe (as Stein blately lies) that aliens seeded the earth but what was most likely designer. This example is just symbolic for the greater lieing and distorting that this propangda happens to be.

Ben Stein and the makers of the film in contrast to pro-evolution scientists and writers such as Dr. Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens etc refuse to go on radio or tv talk shows where their views might be challenged by a non softball question. Dawkins, Hitchens and others on that side commonly go on shows where they have to defend their point of view. In other words their arguments are strenghtened because that environment (or criticism) forces them to defend their views making them more even more reasoned out and stronger. Ironically kind of like natural selection or ""Darwinism"" in action. The film also reportedly made cost $20 million to make much more then its' earnings of around $7 million even though it was heavily promoted by conservatives on the radio.

This movie is what it is, it bashes evolution through associating it with atheists. The movie makers' understand that atheists are a despised group, especially among those who believe in creationism and who will watch this film. So, it associates atheists with evolution even though most Americans who believe in evolution also believe in a deity. After all, only about 10% of Americans lack a belief in a deity but about 50% believe in evolution. Even if only atheists believed in evolution that wouldnt' be an argument against evolution, which again is settled based on the evidence for or against it. Not what people want to believe.",1260748800,4,8279,4.7152729785763645
3501223,1,B001BYLFFS,"I teach a class that includes logic and logical fallacies. This film is a wonderful teaching tool for me. From start to finish, it is a buffet of logical fallacies. My students are justifiably appalled at the film's obvious weaknesses, such as the film maker's failure to ever provide a single piece of evidence to support the case of intelligent design. The ad hominem association of evolution with the Nazi genocide is so over-the-top that it actually made my students, religious kids included, angry. Thank you, Ben Stein, for making a film so riddled with ignorance of science and fallacious claims -- you have unwittingly helped today's young people to be more vigilant in their examination of claims such as yours!

On a personal note, I regret that I had to actually buy this film to use it as a teaching tool. Spending my own money on such laughable propaganda was painful, even when it serves my students well as a negative example!",1260662400,7,941,4.773006134969325
3501224,1,B001BYLFFS,"I started watching the documentary with an open mind to find out what was the case of Intelligent Design (ID) proponents. At the start I thought that the claims were reasonable and I started to wonder why was Intelligent Design dismissed by the academia. However, as the movie progressed, in addition to being annoyed by the overuse of Lord Privy Seals, melodramatic use of music, and the monotony of Stein's voice, I could not reasonable accept virtually anything of what was being said.

Expelled mainly argues that the theory of Intelligent Design--the assertion that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection""--is censored by a ""big science"" conspiracy and that Darwinism will spiral into a dystopian society similar to Nazi Germany. These and other arguments are misleading and do not contend with fact.

The irony of the film is clearly demonstrated in the expulsion of P.Z. Myers, who was interviewed in the film, from a screening of Expelled, a film promoting freedom of speech. And this was in addition to the documentary's discrepancy of focus, on which Myers wrote, ""I mean, seriously, not telling one of the sides in a debate about what the subject might be and then leading him around randomly to various topics, with the intent of later editing it down to the parts that just make the points you want, is the video version of quote-mining and is fundamentally dishonest."" Stein is obviously ignorant and closed-minded of the alternative arguments of the subject he is exploring, as demonstrated by asking of Richard Dawkins if he believes in any gods. The interviewing technique is further undermined by selecting for the ID proponents exclusively associates of the Discovery Institute.

I found the arguments to be almost parallel to the position of Concerned Women for America (CWA), a Conservative Christian political action group. (You may see Richard Dawkins interview Wendy Wright, the President of CWA on Youtube) Her arguments are as follows: A) ID is true because the belief in god is beneficial to society, and B) Evolution is false because it would create an apocalyptic society and because ID is censored. In addition, they attempt to support ID by criticizing Evolution, stating that Evolution means Social Darwinism, and C) If Evolution is true, then Hitler must be right; Darwinism caused the Holocaust, D) Evolution caused the the millions of deaths under Stalin, and E) If Evolution is true, life is void of meaning and morals.

The documentary is long, boring, 3rd grade, and, above all, repulsive in its reasoning. The misleading of its interviewees is appalling. The backers of ID carefully abstain from attempts to show that this hypothesis makes matters more intelligible. ID is not science because it is not testable and can not be disproved. I would recommend this documentary to marvel at the lengths of incredible rationalization to which the proponents of religion are willing to go to sustain their obsolete view.",1260662400,4,3064,5.085487077534792
3501225,1,B001BYLFFS,"This film is in no way an exploration of intelligent design vs Darwinism. The first and most glaring omission of the movie is a definition of intelligent design and the theory that these ""scientists"" were punished for publishing. Evolution is defined (erroneously) several times, but ID not once, why? Because it is not a theory, but a dressed up version of creationism. The second glaring omission is any interviews with scientists who believe in God, but not intelligent design. Over 40% of the American Acad. of Sciences lists themselves as Christians, so why ignore them? Because it disproves the film's premise, so ignore the evidence (a theme necessary to believe ID). The third glaring omission is history. When the film says that science caused fascism, Nazism, and the Holocaust,it conveniently ignores the Inquisition, the Crusades, the rape of the Congo and what Darwin really wrote. It ignores that anti-semitism, a lost war, collapsed economy, and the insanity of Hitler were the main contributing factors to the Holocaust. The film quote mines, outright misquotes and distorts data and court cases, and ignores any fact that contradicts their belief. Darwinism is presented as this revered dogma of scientists that must be protected at all costs, but in reality large portions of Darwin's theories have been chucked in favor of new evidence, hence Modern Synthetic Theory is what is taught in college, not Darwin's theory, but this is never once mentioned.  If you believe in Creationism or ID, fine, but don't dress it up as science. Religion is religion and science is science. You can only combine them through deception and distortion.

3501247,1,B001BYLFFS,"""No Intelligence Allowed"" could not be a more perfect subtitle for this. It is BY FAR the most dishonest, irresponsible, and intellectually lazy film I've ever seen in my life. At one point, the film tells us how Hitler used Darwin's theories, as some kind of odd proof against Darwin's legitimacy. But Hitler also used the Bible to justify much of what he did. So by the logic of this film, that should discredit Christianity as well, right? In another segment someone argues that we should lessen the importance of religion in America and make it less central to our culture, to which Ben's voice-over asks, ""But will elimating religion create a Utopia?"" HUH???

Ben and his cohorts go on and on about the discrimination against them and how un-Democratic and unfair it is that their Creationism not be considered legitimate science. They are too blind to see that Creationism is dismissed because there is NO EVIDENCE for it, while there is a boatload of evidence to support natural selection. The Creationist agrument is truly nothing more than ""Evolution just CAN'T be right! I just can't believe it! There's no way!"" Creationism/Intelligent Design is not a theory; it's only an emotional rejection of a theory.

3501248,1,B001BYLFFS,"The subtitle for this movie was ""No Intelligence Allowed"", and it makes it more than clear that the filmmakers didn't use any while making this trash.

I watched this movie a few nights ago, on the basis of hearing both sides of this ""debate"", and what I saw was a fine example of Michael Moore style creative editing, paranoia, and straight up lying.

I'd like to start out by saying that Expelled repeatedly mentions the massive amounts of evidence FOR Intelligent Design, and the gaping holes in Darwinian Evolution.  However, there is never a single mention of any specific evidence for Intelligent Design, nor is there any example of any ""holes"" in Evolution.

The foundation of the movie is something called ""Irreducible Complexity"".  IC, for those of you who may not know, is the scientifically bankrupt idea that, if you can't understand how something works or came to be, then God did it.  The major problem with this idea is that it doesn't follow any kind of logic at all.

The movie also mentions that Intelligent Design is in no way a new name for Creationism, even having the president of the Discovery Institute say as much (so much for unbiased sources).  The Kitzmiller trial already confirmed what any rational person knows however.  ID is just a subversive re-branding of Creationism.  Intelligent Design is just a Trojan Horse of sorts, so that those who wish to destroy secularism (I must remind you that Secularism is one of the main ideas this country was founded upon, and protects tax-payers from having their money used to indoctrinate our children), and have Christianity taught as the one true religion.

Yet another lie the movie tries to pass on is the idea that only dirty amoral Atheists (GASP!) accept the fact of Evolution.  This is completely wrong however, and countless priests, bishops, and other deeply religious people fully support Evolution, via something called Theistic Evolution.

I could go on and on and completely debunk this movie, but anyone with half a brain has already researched this themselves.  The movie whips the unthinking into a paranoid frenzy over the idea that Big Bad Science is suppressing them and telling them how to think; That it's actively trying to ruin the lives of anyone who disagrees with it.

3501251,1,B001BYLFFS,"At the urging of a colleague at work this week, I watched ""Expelled,"" even though Ben Stein and Richard Dawkins both leave me a shade cold.  Essentially, the movie is a push for ""ID"" education (""Intelligent Design"") using academic horror-stories of people supposedly persecuted for their beliefs in ""ID"" to - I think - ""prove"" that the evolution-only crowd have become doctrinaire monsters.  Apart from this weird approach to promoting a certain point of view, which also smacks of the old Nixonian ""liberal elite"" meme, I was dismayed to see Richard Dawkins asked absurdist hypotheticals and then taken completely out of context later in the self-same film.  Did the editors think their audience so gullible that such a glaring piece of manipulation would go un-noticed?  That fact alone suggests that a very cynical hand indeed was behind this piece of ""work.""

But even assuming for a moment this was accidental, the movie fails because it fails the rhetorical test.  It fails to persuade.  First, I could not tell if the film was about ""ID"" or a jeremiad against the ""boogeymen"" who were supposedly promoting Darwin in some anti-religious camarilla of deceit.  So, lacking a central well-defined premise, I was treated to almost two hours of shady people complaning about their alleged maltreatment and Stein becoming a swollen, ill-tempered blowhard who seemed possessed less of indignation at the death of academic freedom - as he sees it - than just a victim of a ""gestalt"" kind of anger that went nowhere.  Ultimately, the movie did nothing to advance any debate or discussion of any kind, leaving me with the impression that I had been had - had by Stein and his collaborators who, seeing a niche market, slapped together a slovenly pastiche of ill-supported grievances to polish their cable news ""talking head"" bona fides.  The movie should have been called, ""Watch Ben Stein Continue to Seek Relevance Using Wearisome Old Tricks.""

Some people have mentioned websites and other places where, apparently, this ""documentary"" has been trashed, and thoroughly.  I have not looked at those, but if my first impression is correct, I am sure I would not be surprised.

So, my impression is that this film is not only dishonest, but almost dishonest to the point of being a ""bread and circuses"" scam, kind of a ""tarted up"" cable news or radio talk show which, I understand, these days is currency of rapidly diminishing intellectual value.

No recommendation.  If this kind of debate interests you, I think you can find many pro and con sites on YouTube (including, I believe, an excellent ""Nova"" program on the adverse-ID decision in the ""Dover"" case) which are a lot shorter, free, and without this kind of promotional grandstanding.

3501252,4,B001BYLFFS,"This video is an introduction to the flaws of Darwinism. It poses a few awkward questions and highlights how some scientists have been punished for suggesting that perhaps Darwin was wrong.

It's not a very detailed attack on the Theory of Evolution. I think Mr Stein is merely asking the viewer to open his mind to the idea that there actually might be an alternative to the ""sacred scientific dogma"" of Darwin.

The documentary pinpoints the essential argument for design - the complexity of the cell and DNA. There is an impressive animation sequence, showing some of the inner workings of the cell. It is a pity there was not more of this.

The wall is breaking - and Mr Stein needs to be commended for bringing to popular attention some of the big cracks in the idea that we all came from a very lucky primordial soup that got hit by lightening and so resulted in the greatest work of genius known to man - the self-replicating digitally encoded cell.",1258329600,5,956,4.578947368421052
3501253,5,B001BYLFFS,My husband and I watched this video.  We have had a lot of discussion about it.  I felt I was informed on the subject of evolution and intelligent design before I watched this.

3501254,5,B001BYLFFS,"Cha-ching! (The sound of money being made in the course of performing a valuable public service.)

I spent many years in academics, and I concur with Mr. Stein that the 'ideal' university (where diverse ideas are tolerated and explored), is nearly extinct. One of the foundational notions of tenure is that Professors may argue for various positions, regardless of widespread acceptability, without fear of losing their jobs. Intellectual freedom is supposed to be one of the university's foundational values. Instead, several liberally-biased dogmas reign on most university campuses, and it is extremely politically incorrect to question them. It can easily cost you your job.

Mr. Stein gives several examples and interviews with scientists/scholars who were 'Expelled' precisely because they had the audacity to question the current paradigm of evolution. In this documentary, Mr. Stein focuses upon a group of scientists who support the biological notion of 'Intelligent Design' (ID).

But ID is just one example; there are many such off-limits topics in the academy, including race, gender, religion, and climate.

Instead of open discussion and debate about ID, the strategy of the NeoDarwinism crowd is to ignore and suppress the ideas of anyone who does not 'bow at the altar of Darwin' before publishing or presenting their work. It is comical! So much so, it has become a game for me to find the statement in editorials and scientific papers that 'inoculates' the author from being 'quoted by creationists' or criticized by NeoDarwinists. Try it for yourself, and see if you don't agree. The next time you read something regarding a Biology topic, look for the 'bowing' comment or statement. It is usually in the first paragraph.

Congratulations to Mr. Stein for:
a) Being clever and perceptive enough to recognize what is transpiring (academic intolerance of an opposing point of view);
b) Demonstrating entrepreneurial prowess while exposing intellectual dishonesty and violations of academic freedom (Mr. Stein is clearly brilliant and understands capitalism);
c) Giving Richard Dawkins enough rope to hang himself (his interview with ""fundamentalist Darwinist"" Richard Dawkins is priceless!)
d) Bringing attention to a scientific matter that has been infected by politics; exposing this problem could actually end up facilitating scientific progress in this area.

AND... all the while...

e) Being witty and entertaining.

Congratulations, and best regards, Ben Stein!",1257206400,14,2485,5.503937007874016

3501289,5,B001BYLFFS,"This is a very entertaining, and sometimes stirring, humanistic argument for freedom of intellect. Mr. Stein begins by interviewing those academics who have been suppressed by the established academic order.

He then describes what ""Intelligent Design"" is about. It is not about teaching religion in school. It is not about replacing science with religion. It is not about removing one's intellect to fall in line with the party agenda. Ironically that is indeed what evolution is about. (I am a Bible believing Christian and definitely do not want religion taught in schools.) So what does it mean? It means that there are holes in the current theory, originally posited by Darwin, which needs to be worked on. And of course it makes that case that _some_ intelligent designer had a hand in our presence.

Addressing Voltaire's concern, Mr. Stein asks what in history can we learn from societies which have embraced Darwinist theory? He showed an image of Stalin waving happily to his loyal fans in the streets below. If that doesn't forewarn you, he then played passages from Hitler's speeches, as well as discussed the connections with eugenics, and abortion here in the United States. He concludes this segment with ""I know that Darwinism doesn't automatically equate to Nazism."" -Ben Stein, EXPELLED, @1:15.

3501290,5,B001BYLFFS,"Love the only lightly edited Dr. Richard Dawkins and Ben Stein interview---Stein asks a mild question ... politely  --- and Dawkins squirms and stutters.

But the real meat of this fun, fastpaced, and well researched DVD are the many clips of MANY pro and con persons on the questions below
""Should intelligent design be mentioned in colleges? ""
""Should professional magazine editors refuse articles even mentioning intelligent design?""
""Are some profs (even a major scholar like Dr. Guillermo Gonzales---with lots of research, published works) getting CANNED because they mention the deadly ""ID"" concept?""

This DVD makes some assertions that some will disagree with. But it is worth watching...unless you don't want to see some heavyweight scientists, others espousing a theory you don't want to even DISCUSS i.e. the potential that just maybe there is an intelligent designer ofthe universe...!

No, the DVD does not prove all points it asserts. But its biggest assertion - that some are censoring the ID discussion instead of allowing rational debate - still holds true. Just saw a Wikipedia editor dump any articles, books written by editors, authors who might belive in an intelligent designer. And the Wiki editor did not offer scientific refutation of the articles, books he removed---he merely said they were from persons in the ""intelligent design"" movement.

So censorship (lite on scholarship - heavy on outright censoring) rolls on - as the DVD alleges...

In defense of intelligent design, Stein goes back to the theory of evolution and relates it to fascism, Nazi's practices and atheism. At the same time, Stein and the interviewees claim that intelligent design is driven by science not religion. However; no scientific evidence other than complexity of designs was given to support this claim.

It is very refreshing to think freely and investigate, and for that alone Stein should be praised, but he spoiled that refreshment by being judgmental and offensive during his interviews. I have to admit that Stein doesn't have the charisma and presence that Bill Maher, for example, offers to keep the audience engaged when debating such a weighty subject. Also, As Stein made his case about the holocaust, the deep emotional pain that he obviously feels as a Jew, became a distraction and detracted from the strength of his argument.

Richard Dawkins is prominently displayed in this piece. He's a Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, arguably the best known Darwinist on the planet, and says that those who do not believe in evolution are ignorant, stupid or insane.

3501307,4,B001BYLFFS,"I enjoyed this documentary very much. However, there were also some points which I think needed better coverage.

Strong Points:

1. Excellent documentation of the academic intolerance for anything other than evolution within the classroom. As one reviewer said, it is amazing to see people who once wanted open debate now shutting down open debate.

2. Excellent introduction to some of the basic scientific issues between ID and Darwinism. The film introduced these issues without taking away from the main point of the film.

3. Interesting discussion of the link between Hitler and Darwin, and the link was even handled with caution with David Berlinski making certain to distinguish between Darwinism as a cause of Nazism, and Darwinism as a precondition for Nazism [the former being false, the latter being true].

Weak points:

1. The presuppositional and worldview issues were not brought out very well. They were mentioned in passing, but how to go about solving these issues was not discussed. The issue between the two sides is, at base, philosophical, not scientific. Evidence doesn't speak for itself, it must be interpreted, and one must have a worldview in terms of which one is going to interpret that evidence. How to decide between these worldviews is really the issue, and it was never addressed. For this topic, I would recommend getting hold of Greg Bahnsen's criticism of Michael Martin's book ""Atheism a Philosophical Justification,"" and look at the section on Taylor's version of the teleological argument. Also, look at his lectures on Evolution, and his criticisms of Darwinism in his overview of philosophy class.

2. The issue of the modern view of separation of church and state [that is, the view that separation of church and state means separation of state and God] was never addressed. When this view is taken, it basically makes the state secular. How is anyone going to accept an argument for any transcendence when they presuppositionally rule out that possibility with the modern view of separation of church and state? In reality, this modern view of separation of church and state is one of the major culprits in denying free speech, and it plays in big time in this discussion.

3. While the history of science was mentioned briefly by William Debinski and David Berlinski, it is extremely important in this discussion. I also think it is a mistake to act as if science is building a house of ideas from the first scientist until now. I would recommend Thomas Kuhn's book ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" to discuss these issues. This is important, because, as Kuhn argues, the shifts in science over time were not just increases in knowledge, they were entire paradigm shifts. In fact, the way Kuhn argues for the marginalization of a new paradigm when it is proposed certainly reminds you of what is going on in this film.

4. The idea of ID is somewhat vague. As a Christian, I would have difficulty endorsing it, because it seems to want to leave aside all Christian presuppositions, and just look at ""neutral"" science between all faith systems. However, in my mind this is not possible, and it is, indeed, dangerious. There is no neutral ground, as the Bible declares that all of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found in Christ Jesus. Rather than argue on an allegedly scientifically neutral ground, it is much better, in my estimation, to show that Darwinists themselves have presuppositions that they bring to they table, and point out that their ultimate commitments are, in point of fact, ""religious.""

All in all, though, it is certainly worth watching, given the discussion of free speech, and the discussion of basic issues. [Oh, and some of the humor is good too]. Ben Stein said that the movie was about free speech, and, in that regard, he accomplished his purpose.",1252886400,8,3839,4.965732087227415

Science is so ever changing that to erect one's fortress around one theory is total foolishness because sooner or later more will be discovered that refutes that theory.",1252886400,8,456,4.935064935064935
3501309,4,B001BYLFFS,"Synopsis of the Film:

Ben Stein examines controversies surrounding evolution and intelligent design, interviewing a large number of people with widely differing views on the various issues involved.

Good:
- A large number of people are directly interviewed by Ben Stein.
- A wide variety of issues are explored, not simply ""evolution vs. intelligent design"".
- Presentation style is very entertaining.

Bad:
- Ben Stein employs several tactics which are not logical, such as incredulity at explanation for the beginning of life given by Darwinists.
- A number of side-issues serve to distract.
- Distinct things are often equivocated, such as Darwinism and Nazism.

Though I agree with some of Ben Stein's conclusions, I am afraid that some of the argument he makes for those conclusions is not sound.  Further, his criticisms of the conclusions of ""the other side"" are, in my opinion, not entirely fair or logical.  He does expose an ugly truth of academia which is not specific to evolution/intelligent design, nor even to the scientific fields: there is an established academic orthodoxy, and departure is powerfully discouraged.

The Bottom Line:
I found this film to be thought-provoking and very entertaining.  Unless you are already embittered by battles fought in this arena, this film should prove enjoyable and at least mildly intellectually stimulating, regardless of your own opinion on these matters.",1252800000,8,1415,5.313901345291479

No one theory has ever been PROVEN. This documentary shows the people who have been ostracized from the scientific community for daring to question evolution with intelligent design. Even one of the biggest proponents of evolution states that earth began from some intelligent beings sending spores out into space to begin the growth of life. He doesn't make a lot of sense for the defense of evolution, but it makes for a humorous film.",1252713600,9,621,4.7592592592592595
3501311,5,B001BYLFFS,"Expelled was an exceptionally thought provoking film. I was hooked as soon as I heard it advertised on the Bible Answer Man Broadcast which is why I brought the film. One of the reasons why I like the film is that the film engages both sides of the argument. Ben Stein talks to leading scientists, philosophers and others regarding the issues.

Also, it helped me to define my place in the Intelligent Design movement. The Intelligent Design movement (ID) is a minimalist stance. You don't have to believe in God to believe in ID. Maybe ""believe"" is the wrong word. You don't have to ""adhere"" to a particular religion to be a proponent of ID. I am a creationist under ID, therefore to define my thoughts, I believe that there is intelligent design in the cosmos, which leads me to believe that there is an Intelligent Designer, which I believe is God and more specifically the God of the Bible.

Now, an agnostic can adhere to ID and that person can believe that there is a higher intellect that is unknowable. Or a Muslim or whomever. But the movement itself is basically saying there is design out there. By the end of the film, even Richard Dawkins says it's possible there's an intelligent designer through aliens that came about through some Darwinian means and seeded life here.

I wanted to put that out there just so a person who may read this can understand ID. But the film does more than that. It talks about how the freedom to question is being stamped out. The reporter who said that she wasn't a Christian-she was Jewish-she wasn't even religious and she gave an equal platform to both sides and was reprimanded for it. The scientist who remain in the dark regarding how you cannot go against the status quo or else you will lose your job. You can disagree in private with the Darwinian theory but not in public.

The real issue even isn't about Evolution vs. ID; it's about the stamping out of freedom and I think the film did an excellent job in depicting the overall issue and not just ID vs Evolution although it does a great job.

I am not one of these people who likes to tell about the movie but I do want to give an impression that it is worth your time and it is a good film that everyone should watch.",1252540800,11,2225,4.443627450980392

The movie is about how scientists who dare to criticize Darwinism or discuss  Intelligent Design (ID) are expelled, fired, denied tenure, blacklisted, and bitterly denounced. Stein points out that freedom of speech, freedom to teach doesn't extend to this issue. Stein envokes death camps in Nazi Germany as a backdrop for interviews that explain Charles Darwin's considerable influence on Adolf Hitler. The Darwin influence on Hitler's political views and musing, are well known in most writings on Hitler the politician, however, seem absent today in mainstream discussion of Darwin's theories. No doubt the evolutionists of academia don't like this difficult fact. From this Stein also points out how Darwin's theories influenced one of America's most embarrassing periods, the eugenics fad of the early 20th century, when thousands of Americans were legally sterilized becasue they were deemed physically or mentally unfit.

No one who believes in free speech should disagree with Stein's premiss that the liberal attack on freedom of inquiry is un-Democratic, anti-science, and anti-American. I take it one further, and apply the liberals' own standard: attacks on freedom of inquiry of the entrenched idiotic status quo in liberal academia is a hate crime.",1252281600,8,1512,5.452991452991453

These ""scientists"" are holding the truth in unrighteousness and then denying that any such thing is happening.

  Mr. Stein doesn't just offer opinions, but uses the very words, documents, books, etc. of these threatened icons of modern science, be they heads of university departments, government clones, or just outspoken atheists, to prove that there is a hidden agenda in the halls of science, and it's not very scientific!
  It's actually not very hidden either, as you'll see how even the lightest discussion of intelligent design can get one of those charged with finding and despensing the truth, into very serious sanctions, buy the ""scientific"" community.  The results of this underlying sanction is to intimidate leaders into silence, least they lose their coveted, and earned, positions of authority.

Are you kidding me? I am a teacher and I have been harassed and intimidated by my administrators for doing the following: sending news clippings (without comment or editorializing on my part-- these were cut and paste jobs from journals and internet science news services) to other teachers. The stories had to do with such topics as the genetic basis for sociopathic behavior, the correlation between school funding and academic success, gender differences in learning styles, etc. My administrator called me into his office and hinted that life could become very difficult if I continued to send these stories to teachers. He told me that no one was going to threaten the ""positive thinking"" environment that he was trying to instill in his school (he was a big fan of that stupid Oprah book, ""The Secret""). This principal said he didn't give a damn about data--he told me to to stop doing what I was doing or face the consequences. I couldn't afford to lose my job, so I stopped. Don't tell me that I should have gotten a lawyer--I made 40,000$ a year at the time, had student loans to pay off, and could barely afford my rent, never mind a lawyer.
The schools are liberal brainwashing camps where minorities are told that they are poor because of persecution by white men, where women are told that all men are out to rape them, where gay students are told that Christians (never Islam, of course. These academic cowards are always silent on that religion and its murderous crimes against women and gays) are bigots who drum up hate against homosexuals, where all literature by white Europeans is dismissed as part of a massive oppressive culture that should be destroyed, etc. Dare to argue against any of this dogma and you will be out of a job.

3501351,1,B001BYLFFS,"Let's get a couple of things clear.

First, the professors in this movie, who claim to have been fired for their theories, were in fact penalized for completely different reasons. Richard Sternberg [...]) was not penalized for his views. He was penalized for circumventing the review process for submitting articles to the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. The problem was not that he argued for an unorthodox theory; it was that he committed academic dishonesty. Similarly, Caroline Crocker was *not* fired from George Mason University; rather, her contract as a *visiting* professor expired. She left the university because her appointment ran out, not because she was fired. Michael Egnor was neither expelled nor fired; rather, he received angry emails from internet users about his blog. If that counts as persecution, then almost every blogger in the world has been persecuted. Robert Marks used Baylor University's webspace to post materials from the Design Institute, while falsely claiming that Baylor University officially supported the Design Institute. Understandably, they asked him to alter it. Once he did, they permitted him to post it again. Finally, Guillermo Gonzalez' failure to be tenured had nothing to do with his opinions about evolution. He was denied tenure because he published very little, and never secured any outside sources of funding. Both of these are reasons for being denied tenure, regardless of one's views. So, the first thing to get clear on is the following: NONE of the allegedly ""expelled"" academics were penalized for their stances on evolution. They were penalized for academic violations.

Moreover, most anti-semitism was supported by Christians like Martin Luther, who thought of the Jews as murderers of Christ. [...]Instead, he speaks as if all anti-semitism, and *especially* Nazi anti-semitism, is supported by evolutionary theory. Yet Hitler's book, ""Mein Kampf,"" has no mention of Darwin anywhere. Not a single one. Instead, Hitler appeals to religion in justifying his anti-semitism.

 [...] What this means, of course, is that Ben Stein ignores the real reason why academics reject intelligent design--namely, that it is unwarranted and explanatorily inadequate.

Beware of this piece of disgusting propaganda. It contains no science. It contains no philosophy, even. It contains nothing that would appeal to a thinking person. Its central argument is based on claims which are demonstrably false, and its rhetorical force is exhausted by irrelevant references to Nazis. [...]",1250380800,13,2551,5.480916030534351

3501354,4,B001BYLFFS,"Expelled-No Intelligence Allowed

Great opening sequences-Mr. Stein as a student in a small prestigious (assumed) elitist (assumed) college classroom asking the professor if an Intelligent Designer could have created life.  The professor is seen stammering in front of his blackboard with ""Neo Darwinism"" scribbled on it.

""Expelled"" is a Premise production and a Rampant film.

Next we see black and white footage of children from the 60's kicking a small ball on the corner street of a town square in Berlin.  Next, we have images of commanders making plans to build the Berlin wall (building began August 13, 1961).  They are studying a map of the wall with ""Berlin"" in bold print letters.  Its great footage and you wonder about Ben Stein and his Jewish heritage coming up, but the viewer doesn't quite know what to make of it yet.  I know it captivated my curiosity.  I haven't thought of the Berlin Wall in some time.  I remember I was a student at the University of Washington campus in 1989 when it was reported to be ""coming down"".

""Expelled"" was produced by Logan Craft; Walt Ruloff and John Sullivan with associate producer Mark Mathis.

Next we see some young military men building the wall.  Thus, we are witnessing footage of construction of one of the most famous physical barriers between peoples.  Its quite moving, really, but of course a very sad part of world history.  Onlookers watch the walls erection.

""Expelled"" was edited by Simon Tondeur.  It was written by Kevin Miller and Ben Stein.  The music was done by Andy Hunter and Robbie Bronnimann.

The whole opening ""Wall"" scene is accompanied by an eerie violin version of Bob Dylan's ""All along the Watchtower"".  In fact, the music score for this documentary is just superb--made especially so given the placement of each number--including a Vanda and Young song ""Love is in the Air"" performed by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame; Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky"" and Martin Gore's ""Personal Jesus"" performed by Johnny Cash.  You have to see the film to believe the perfection of the score to the documentary.  A definite highlight!

The black and white footage ends when the boys accidentally kick the ball over the Berlin Wall.  They look up forlorned and the movie title ""Expelled. No Intelligence Allowed"" in black and white takes us to the movie proper.

Ben Stein opens in a typical college auditorium/classroom in Malibu with Mr. Stein seen reviewing the notes of his speech while and introduction to the talk is being made.  Its a great way to open up and get a feel for Mr Stein as guest speaker and now documentarian.  His speech begins with notions of freedom and its pursuit(s) that have been a staple of our American way-of-life since its inception.  He has always assumed that Science has always been free to ask any question and to pursue any line of questioning.  After hearing anecdotal stories of Evolution vs. Creationism he then began to realize that this is not necessarily true.  It all began when he met evolutionary biologist Richard Von Sternburg in Washington D.C. who was a former editor of a journal tied to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.  Dr. Stephen Meyer wrote an article that Sternburg greenlighted for publication that contained Dr Meyer's views on Intelligent Design.  For this he is no longer affiliated with the Smithsonian.

This is the first person ""Expelled"" from the Darwinian ""school"".  There are 4 more similar expulsions including a neuroscientist; an astronomer and an engineer.  All supposedly over the mere mention of Intelligent Design in their work.  The film does a superb job with interjecting more black and white footage of various images that give a strong emotional tie to the words of the expelled interviewees.  For instance, when interviewing Dr. Sternburg as he articulates the emotional reaction he witnessed in his colleagues upon hearing of his ID view-point, the documentary interjected two very poignant black and white clips, one of an United Nations head-of-state angrily pounding his fists on his table and another of 4 men on a pier pushing each other with one landing a punch in the mouth.  This feature continues throughout the interviews and in some other places throughout the film and works very well.  The director and cinematographer are to be commended.

Next, interviews take place of some of the Darwinists in the scientific establishment, including Dr. Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins.  Overall, this is done well enough, but a criticism of the film is that the interviews are too short and don't really convey any strong sense of the problem.  The problem is given more ID proponent coverage and Mr. Stein boils it down to something more akin to a ""religious war"" over the principle of evolution and no longer about scientific investigation.  This is probably more sad fact than fiction.  In fact, two of the Darwinists admitted that Darwinism deconverted them from their religious beliefs and led to their atheism.  One, Dr. Province of Cornell University, had this to say (which I loosely quote):

""Darwinian Evolution starts by giving up a deity and life-after-death.  Once these two are given up, it is not hard to give up believing life has an intrinsic morality.  There is no hope nor purpose to human life.  If you believe in evolution you cannot have free-will; there is no hope what-so-ever for there being any meaning in human life.  You live; you die and you are gone.  We will be gone when we die.""

Of course, this is his personal view and should not be taken as the views of any other Darwinists nor atheists.  In fact, this view is generally debunked by many progressive thinkers today.

At one point in the middle of the film, Mr. Stein takes us to the Hadamar Memorial where approximately 15,000 people were mass murdered.  Hadamar is a German town where the Nazis performed some of their most heinous crimes against humanity.  So-called ""useless eaters"" the people brought in were usually the physically and mentally handicapped.  He does this when he finds out that Darwinism was embraced by the Nazis.  Here I will cut Mr. Stein a break given his Jewish origins.  In fact, as he puts it quite soberly, ""Given my Jewish heritage, this I had to explore further for personal reasons.""  One Amazon review used the word ""propaganda"" to describe this film. I can see where he might get that from, but it is too strong a word, especially so given Mr. Stein's background.

The whole ""wall"" image becomes very clear now and the use of the Berlin Wall to tie division between peoples past and present is well done.  There is a strong tie to crimes committed by not just Nazi's and their form of ""Natural Selection"", but to those who practiced ""Eugenics"", the ""worst crime in American Medicine"" according to Dr. Michael Egnor who was ""Expelled!"" for writing an essay to high schoolers saying that doctors don't need to study evolution to practice medicine. Wiki has this to say about Eugenics:

""The modern field and term were first formulated by Sir Francis Galton in 1883,[10] drawing on the recent work of his half-cousin Charles Darwin. From its inception eugenics was supported by prominent people, including Margaret Sanger,[11] Marie Stopes, H. G. Wells, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Emile Zola, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, John Harvey Kellogg, Winston Churchill, Linus Pauling[12] and Sidney Webb.[13][14][15] Its most infamous proponent and practitioner was however Adolf Hitler who praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in Mein Kampf, and emulated Eugenic legislation for the sterilization of ""defectives"" that had been pioneered in the United States.[16]""

I think the message, although stark and biased a bit, is a poignant one.  We cannot forget the past crimes of man v. man and when a scientific theory has led to some of the most horrific crimes in this arena, its worth a look, especially when that look is seen from someone who it hit so close to home.  As far as the tie, he explores the connection of Nazism to Darwinism and concludes that is is ""not a sufficient condition, but it is certainly a necessary one."" I see and take his point for the limited worth it offers.  It is not an indictment of the scientific community nor Darwinists today.  I take it as food for thought and it is digestable in this format.

Mr. Stein closes by coming back to his talk at the Malibu campus where he started with his talk to the students on freedom.  He tells the students that ""freedom itself is being expelled!  Darwinian society is so entrenched, by what authority do they decide what is and what is not science.""

However, the piece does not delve very deeply into issues such as the origin of the matter, time, space, and the universe, nor does it endorse religion, which is probably a good idea since this is marketed to a mass audience.

3501378,2,B001BYLFFS,"First things first, I -did- watch the movie.

I have no issue with the subject matter in this movie.  An idea is an idea, and people have every right to express them. I strongly advocate free expression, hence why I write this! My issue with this movie is how the subject matter is presented.

The movie starts with establishing Ben Steins credibility and introduces him as an unbiased viewpoint; later it is tossed in that he's not so unbiased after all as an afterthought.

The movie seems to generalize all of science as it progresses and draws a line in the sand for viewers. It segregates and creates dichotomy where this is none. Ben Stein presses scientists for information with many irrational questions throughout the movie, demanding definitive answers from science but asking for none from Intelligent Design. Ben pummels scientists for answers without accepting that we don't know everything yet. The single biggest obstacle to learning is the belief that you know the answers.

This movie is not, in any way, a documentary or an educational lesson.  The best lesson this movie offers is a excellent lesson in how to manipulate information and crop interviews to achieve your intended message. After a thoughtful pause over the star meter I gave this movie 1 extra star than it deserved for expert editing. I know genius when I see it.

However, this movie is considered to be ""polarizing"" as previous reviewers noted for one reason: It most definately, and absolutely, is a religious film. Any suggestion that it's not by a ""reviewer"" should rewatch the final ten minutes of the film and count the number of times Ben Stein uses the nomer ""god.""

I am not opposing any religious view, just stating facts here: you will find this movie for rent in church libraries and for sale in christian stores (speaking from experience here people). Still, people seem to suggest that it is ""scientific"" and ""free speech"" when in reality, it truly is a propaganda film. A -well made- and deviously disguised propaganda film.

The -BIG PROBLEM- with films like this is that it smacks of mid-late 20th century propaganda films. The makers of this film aren't trying to teach and learn about the idea of Intelligent Design, they're trying to discredit the theory of evolution and Charles Darwin.  They are attempting to make an issue with religion and science when so many scientists enjoy both. By definition religion is not science. There is no great conspiracy in acadamia against religious beliefs, but acadamia does require evidence to back up theories. Intelligent Design is specifically NOT a theory, as it lacks any supporting evidence whatsoever.

Intelligent Design, people, is another word for Creationalism.  This is just the facts, so don't admonish me for saying it.  The Judicial System of the United States of America has ruled in court that Intelligent Design is Creationalism, so if you disagree: tell it to the judge. My view is irrelevant.

So, I apologize for ""trolling"" the review board but an honest and straightforward answer on ""how was the movie"" needed to be posted.  And please, before all the 'board rats jump me, please refer yourself to the multitude of informational sites from NCSE (The National Center for Science Education) and others easily found on google.  Feel free to disagree with me, just bring along some facts.

3501383,3,B001BYLFFS,"I just watched Expelled and it does a pretty good job of making its point: If a scientist or professor supports, publishes, or speaks about Intelligent Design, they are blackballed.

Now, I'm not here to argue for Darwinism or for Intelligent Design, but I will say that I did learn more about what Intelligent Design actually is than what the Darwinists would have you believe. As in most arguments, each side ridicules, oversimplifies, and belittles the opinion of the opposition. The film does a superb job of defining ID--basically it's a theory that tries to explain the ORIGINS of life forms and proposes that there was an intelligent designer (God, alien, etc.), but does not necessarily deny certain theories of evolution (depending on how ""evolution"" is defined). Much to my surprise, ID also can be secular and rid of Creationist stigma. It makes the case that Darwin's theory is a theory and not a law, so there's no harm in researching other theories.

So on to the review. The movie does a pretty good job about highlighting the hypocrisy that is rampant in universities and other research institutions that have tried to categorically silence scientists or professors that dare to even bring up Intelligent Design or publish articles that question the merits of Darwinism. Ben Stein says it's hypocritical because scientific research and academia encourages new ideas and discourse... as long as it doesn't go against the mainstream school of thought (i.e. Global Warming debate). Stein uses a metaphor of the Berlin Wall to illustrate the point.

The film gives some pretty good examples of this hypocrisy, and even has a shocking (but far too short) interview clip with an administrator from Iowa State that flat out says they (I'm paraphrasing here) ""don't want to be associated with Intelligent Design"". Other than that, responses and explanations from universities and institutions that have denied tenure or fired professors are disappointingly absent which does slightly take away some of the credibility of the evidence. This resulted in the film losing one of its stars from my rating.

Towards the end of the film, Ben Stein goes on a trip to visit concentration camps and speaks of how Darwinists have been caught up in Eugenics and genocide back in WWII. I guess it was a good history lesson about how people's beliefs can be carried out to the extreme, but it was somewhat out of place and seemed like a cheap shot at people who championed Darwin's theory. Stein made sure he said that he wasn't equating modern day Darwinists to Nazis, but it was still a bit uncomfortable. He seems to be guilty of what the ""others"" were doing which was ridiculing the opposition. Only instead of being called ignorant, stupid, and uneducated, Stein was practically demonizing Darwinists. Alas, this led to the subtraction of a second star from the rating.

Expelled is pretty light on scientific argument of the two theories, which is good for the layman such as myself and for the sake of entertainment value (getting bogged down in lots of scientific details could get boring). So if you are a serious scientist looking for scientific jargon, this isn't for you. If you are interested in seeing a different point of view with an open mind or want to learn a little more about what ID actually is, then this will be a good film to watch. Ben Stein is also really sharp and has a couple of great interviews, so he won't disappoint.

The other part of his argument--that universities persecute proponents of ID--is equally specious.

Ben Stein and his production crew approach with an ideal and an agenda, as do all documentary makers, but instead of forcing evidence into their model they actually follow much of their interviews up with research.  A lesson most of the documentary makers out there need to learn.

I like how this video isn't about creation or intellegent design or evolution, really.  It's about the freedom to investigate.  It's about the clash of world ideals.  It's about the concept of ""what if"".  What if we choose an amoral path?  What if we choose a path of belief?  What if all began with aliens?  What if we never figure out what began the first cell?

Movie making is modern story telling. Ben Stein tells one that will hold you from beginning till end. With an easy flowing script set over illuminating interviews and visuals, Stein embarks on his quest for answers. But for its anti-establishment cheek, this documentary would probably be in line for an award.

Stein travels the world to get an interview with the leading names in the current ID debate. Stein's true craft is his ability to strengthen his point by highlighting the comments of those who disagree with him. His monotone features and understated style suggest an overt seriousness that is covering for some ordinary Joe who's stumbled into the wrong place. Stein's interviewees lower their guard to display their duplicity.

In his deadpan way, in all his interviews he asks the same two questions: From a science perspective, how did life begin? And is it possible that life began by intelligent design?

Some say these questions are unanswerable, invalid, or heaven forbid, unimportant. Yet science has become closed to honest enquiry. Stein shows that our faculties and institutions have set up defense mechanisms to surround a pet theory. Establishment science is currently in denial, suppressing questions that they don't like.

For science or any other part of society to flourish, we must be free to ask tough questions and be allowed to follow evidence wherever it leads.",1246752000,7,1742,4.993103448275862

3501401,4,B001BYLFFS,"I saw this movie in Kelowna, BC Canada  -- where I grew up, studied science and entertained as a musician for many years in the local lounges, nightclubs and TV station. Over this time I was treated very well by all sectors of society. None-the-less after being a Darwinist as a child I gradually became more and more suspicious of Darwinism. Up until 1995 however I believed that academic freedom (in the scientific community) was generally healthy and that questioning Darwinism (a theory of science) was generally permitted. Unfortunately, I was wrong and my questioning since 1995 has been treated with enormous hostility by the Darwinist establishment. In June of 2007 William Dembski (who is in the movie) linked to my weblog (ICON-RIDS) making the point that not all questioners of neo-Darwinism are religious people. The result was an enormous barrage of hatred, according to which I am ""a pig ignorant deceptive weasel"" or ""a scientifically illiterate jackass"" or ""a creationist kook"" (- PZ Myers) etc...

PZ Myers (who is also in the movie) publicly stated in 2004 ""It is time for scientists to break out the brass knuckles and steel toed boots and hammer on the lunatics and crazies."" In 2005 Nature Magazine, one of the leading science publishers in world - to my surprise - voted PZ's blog (where he made these very comments) the number one science blog in the world! Apparently, not a speck of concern or embarrassment regarding PZ's threats of violence exists at Nature Magazine. I was once again forced to downgrade my estimation of the level of integrity in orthodox science. Having personally experienced the hostility of Darwinists I have no choice but to agree with the basic premise of this movie - that big science has indeed lost its way and academic freedom is now being severely compromised by prior ideological commitments. I say this in spite of having spent most of my life arguing against religion and for science. While I have never supported religion of any kind, I also have no intention of supporting corrupt Darwinian ""science.""

Because I am not a religious person, I have many points of agreement with PZ Myers, HOWEVER, I am utterly opposed to the use of violence and or threats of violence in the defense of a theory of science. While this movie is not perfect, it is an *important* movie in that it is the first attempt to break the silence on a crucial issue of which the public is largely unaware (just as I was prior to 1995).

The highlight of the movie, in my opinion, was the interview with Richard Dawkins (a militant Darwinist atheist) in which Dawkins explains how even an atheist such as himself can believe in intelligent design (of say, the first life on earth). This interview clearly shows that Richard is at odds, not with the science of intelligent design detection (if ""suitably"" atheistically framed), but with religion/God. If discovered in the wrong place (unsuitably framed) however, ID reminds him of God and he is hostile to God/religion or spirituality of any kind -just as is much of academia.",1245628800,9,3057,4.850574712643678

3501403,1,B001BYLFFS,"So, I admit that I read reviews about this movie before seeing so I went in with some already formed ideas. But after watching this movie they were all justified. I can't believe someone could see this movie as fair analysis on science. Ben Stein interviews several prominent scientists and asks them silly questions. He also interviews several university professors who where ""discriminated"" against because of their beliefs. I randomly did a google search on Guillermo Gonzalez, who says he was denied tenure because of his belief in creationism. I found that the real reason he was denied tenure was because he wasn't bringing in any research money. What is the point of discussing something if you are not going to tell the whole truth.

Then Stein goes into a looongg diatribe on the parallels between darwinism and the nazis. I admit I've never read Mein Kempf, but I have read the Orgin of Species, but that's besides the point. I don't know if Hitler took Darwinistic principles to justify the holocaust, but it doesnt matter. People can take any principle and belief out of context and use if for evil.  As I am a black woman I know that my ancestors were enslaved for 400 years because of THE BIBLE. Did people not take the ideas in the bible and justify american slavery? Didn't religion justify the crusades, did it not justify 911, or the entire war we are stuck in now? Does that make the bible or religion inherently evil. I don't know, I'm an atheist but do believe its not religion's fault that people take it out of context. (Although sometimes evil can be done with religious justification WITHOUT taking it out of context.) You can bend any idea you want to your way of thinking with enough bs-ing.

I would like for Mr. Stein to not use nasty tactics like telling half truths or showing horrible pictures of the holocaust and drawing invisible parallels, to justify his argument.

3501417,5,B001BYLFFS,"After reading much of the brouhaha about this movie, I finally sat down to watch it myself. As I watched, I was armed with some criticisms of the film which another Amazon poster had given me, apparently mined from expelledexposed.com.

The film is certainly provocative. It intersperses the many interviews featuring a wide spectrum of authors and scholars with clips from old movies and documentaries, often with humorous effect. There is also a lot of imagery from the Berlin wall, which is used throughout the film as a symbol of loss of freedom. That's really the central theme of this film: that academic freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion are important and essential to a free society, and that in regards to the debate between ID and Darwinian evolution this freedom appears to be in jeopardy.

Some of the criticisms of the movie have challenged the factual details of specific cases, but I've noticed that in some of the instances that I've seen, it's actually the anti-ID people who are misrepresenting what the film actually says. Because of the polarizing nature of this issue, objectivity may be hard to come by. One critic complained that the cases of Caroline Crocker and Pamela Winnick were misrepresented in the film. However, when I examined the facts it appeared to me that everything in the film was accurate. I haven't personally investigated every case, but I have seen some clear misrepresentations of the claims in the film by anti-ID people.

Some of the scholars interviewed in the film will rankle many people. For example, Richard Weikart was interviewed in the segment that makes a connection between the Nazi eugenics program and Darwin. Weikart's view is that Hitler was a ""very fanatical Darwinist"", that his vision of perfecting the Aryan race was a Darwinian one, and that ""The war itself was part of the Darwinian struggle for existence for Hitler. And he saw the extermination of the Jews as one of the fronts to this warfare going on as this Darwinian struggle for existence."" Since I haven't read Weikart's book (""From Darwin to Hitler"") I can't assess his argument. I would note that the film also includes part of an interview with David Berlinski about Darwin and eugenics which is quite a bit more nuanced. So it's not fair to say that the film unequivocally presents Darwinism as leading to eugenics, and in fact Stein himself says ""I know that Darwinism does not automatically equate to Nazism. But if Darwinism inspired and justified such horrific events in the past, could it be used to rationalize similar initiatives today?"" Some critics will object to this question being asked. But if you object to this question even being asked, aren't you demonstrating the same opposition to freedom of thought and freedom of speech which is the point of the whole film? To raise the question is not illegitimate, and it seems hard to deny that there is a historical connection (not to mention some obvious parallels) between Darwinian ideas and eugenics.

In regard to the debate about ID and evolution itself, the film doesn't delve into many of the specific arguments. Several pro-ID scholars are interviewed, with the aim being to apparently show that there are some very intelligent, educated scholars and scientists who are challenging Darwinism and believe there is good reason to think there is evidence for intelligent causation in the world, particularly in the world of living systems. This in itself will upset many Darwinists, including some of the Darwinists interviewed in the film who consider the whole thing to be too much rubbish to even waste time on. Thus, one's opinion of the film is bound to be influenced by one's opinion of how much credence Intelligent Design theory has. The larger point, I think, is that even for those who consider ID to be rubbish, who has the right to dictate what can or can't be said in the classroom? That sort of authoritarian thought control has no place in academia, even if you don't agree with ID.

One objection to the film is that it seems to be implied that Darwinism and atheism are necessarily equated. I didn't read that into the film myself. There were some strong statements, especially by Dawkins, that in the minds of many Darwinists evolution lends support to atheism, and that the scientific worldview necessarily results in eliminating religion. More than one of the Darwinists interviewed regard religion as an altogether bad thing, and would be happy if it could be replaced by science. Thus, Darwinian evolution is presented as a weapon for many atheists in the war against religion. It hardly seems necessary to point out that this is, in fact true. It's also true that evolution doesn't necessarily disprove God, but for a great many Darwinists it appears to make God's existence extremely unlikely.

From my experience, there is very much an atmosphere of hostility to Intelligent Design in this country. One only has to peruse any of the many forums for books related to ID to see that. Making any comment in any way favorable to ID is likely to result in some astoundingly vicious abuse and ridicule, along with accusations of being a ""liar for Jesus,"" which I have experienced firsthand. It's very easy for me to believe that the pressure in the academic world and in the media is very intense, and at least equally hostile towards even a neutral position with respect to ID.

I give this film five stars not because I necessarily agree with the viewpoint of every person who is sympathetic to ID in it, but because I think it asks good questions, is provocative in making people think about and discuss the issues (not just ID vs. evolution but of what academic freedom and freedom of speech really mean), and on the whole presents a reasonably balanced perspective of the issues. I think reviewers who regard this film as hopelessly biased and even dishonest are only demonstrating a real lack of objectivity with regard to what the film does and does not say.",1244592000,10,5996,4.872549019607843

It doesn't present a hateful, biased and non-tolerant view of it as many angry atheist in this country do.  No, it allows it to speak for itself, and it speaks well.
  This  movie also brilliantly presents how Atheistic Scientists desire to silence anything or anyone who disagrees with them or presents a different point of view. I think this documentary does a great job of showing the other side, the unheard side, the silenced side.  ""Expelled"" takes great pains to show how some atheistic Scientists are angry and intellectually hostile towards Intelligent Design and how they try to silence them, taking away their American right to freedom of speech.

3501420,4,B001BYLFFS,"In Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed  Ben Stein, former presidential speech writer, economist, author, actor, game show host and scholar, takes us on his journey to explore the claim that academic freedom is being threatened on college campuses today by the intolerant, anti-religious dogma of neo-Darwinists. While several people will quickly answer that Expelled is a documentary about intelligent design and evolution, it's not. And it is. Rather, much like two convincing cases can be made that the American Civil War was about slavery or state's rights, cases can be equally made that Expelled is really about intelligent design or academic freedom.

The movie opens and closes with Stein giving a moving speech to a group of students about freedom; specifically, the academic freedom and the singular importance that all ideas can be exchanged freely.  Cutting away from Stein's speech the movie quickly delves into the issue at hand: have members of academia been ""expelled"" from the academic community for questioning Darwinism and giving credence to the theory of intelligent design.

Stein begins his journey in Washington, D.C. where he interviews Richard Sternberg, the former editor of the academic journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. In 2004, Sternberg published a peer-reviewed article by Stephen Meyer on the Cambrian explosion. Meyer is a known intelligent design proponent and in the article several holes in evolutionary theory were explored. Sternberg was also a research assistant at the Smithsonian when the article was published but was quickly relieved of his duties. Stein interviews scientist after scientist, mostly distinguished professors at universities across the country, who were denied tenure and relieved of their posts for questioning the basic tenets of neo-Darwinism and mentioning other viable theories, namely intelligent design.

Trying to determine if intelligent design is a religious or scientific movement, Ben Stein travels across the country to interview several of its leading proponents. He follows this up by interviewing the leading Darwinists of the day, including P.Z Myers and Richard Dawkins, to hear their objections to intelligent design.

Some of the best parts of the movie occur when Stein asks neo-Darwinist scientists simple questions about the origin of life and watches them stumble over their words as they propose far more fanciful ideas than intelligent design ever put forward. One scientist said he thinks life came from crystals. Stein effectively pointed out the absurdity of this claim by dryly asking him to repeat the idea over and over. The incredulous look on Stein's face was priceless as the scientist again and again tried to explain how life might have been ignited by the power of crystals.

Other theories espoused by the neo-Darwinists were little better. Several, including Richard Dawkins, stated we might have been ""seeded"" by alien life forms. Of course, this only begs the question where these aliens came from. Others still clung to the idea that lightning striking a primordial soup might have jump-started life even though, as Stein pointed out, this has been proven false over and over again in scientific experiments around the world. The hypocrisy of the Darwinist movement was made evident when these scientists entertained the idea of intelligent design from aliens as an ""intriguing"" scientific hypothesis but would not consider intelligent design in the same light.

The most controversial part of Expelled and, inevitably, the part that is gaining the most attention, occurs when Stein investigates the social implications of Darwinism. This leads him to Dachau, Germany where the Nazis operated a ""hospital"" to exterminate humans with defects to further the evolutionary process. Stein quickly and effectively shows the philosophical lineage from Darwinism to Nazism and the eugenics movement of the early 1900's. The connection is undeniable, yet many neo-Darwinists today still vainly refute these claims. (Quick note: Stein takes great pains to ensure his audience that, obviously, not all Darwinists are destined to become fascists, that this was merely one philosophical descendant of Darwinism.)

The movie concludes with a showdown of sorts between Richard Dawkins and Ben Stein. Stein interviews Dawkins, asking him simple questions which Dawkins struggles to answer. This interview alone is worth the price of admission.

 Interspersed throughout these interviews are entertaining snippets from 1950's films and animated shorts. These clips keep Expelled flowing at a fast and entertaining pace and keeps it at a level meant for the average movie-going audience. The computer-animated scene showing the complexity of the most basic cell is breath-taking.

Of course, the movie was produced and edited from an intelligent design point-of-view but many critics who dismiss the film as creationist and theocratic ""propaganda"" miss the point completely. Instead, the film encourages a ""robust"" dialogue where all ideas can be brought forth and freely debated in academic circles. Also, Expelled does not try to be the coup de grace in the ideological battle between evolution and intelligent design. Rather, the film stems from a far more humble agenda, merely asking for a place at the table for the many scientists who believe intelligent design can answer the numerous questions Darwinism is unable to. All in all, Expelled is extremely well-produced, entertaining in its delivery and effective in its message.",1244073600,9,5543,5.477751756440281
3501421,1,B001BYLFFS,"Intellectually dishonest with no science.  It attempts to create controversy where none exists.

3501422,1,B001BYLFFS,"The main premise of the movie is that a supposed ideology of 'Darwinism' is entrenched in academe and disallows any dissent of its views.  Stein makes the point that this goes against the ideal of free speech and more specifically, academic freedom.  What is being disallowed is the recent evolutionary alternative, intelligent design.  To support his argument, Stein proceeds by presenting profiles of several researchers who have been either reprimanded, castigate or fired for trying to publish or suggest that certain biological structures can only be the result of an intelligent designer.  Along with this expose, other positions or ideas dealing with intelligent design, religion and science get misrepresented throughout.

Stein starts by interviewing Richard Sternberg where he mentions that his life was nearly ruined when he published a pro-intelligent design article by Stephen Meyer.  But scientists previously rejected the paper because of shoddy science; not because it talked about ID.  So the paper didn't meet the standards of the journal.  Sternberg also went around the normal peer-review process.  Regarding his firing, He gave notice 6 months to the Smithsonian prior to the paper's publication.  Also, his position at the Smithsonian was an unpaid position which was extended to 2006.  The paper was about the Cambrian explosion, not about the origin of life as stated by Stein.  So the first case that Stein builds quickly unravels in light of the facts.  (The expelledexposed.com website makes short shrift of the rest of the individuals allegedly persecuted by those 'intolerant Darwinists'.)  Later on, Sternberg quips that ID (or the whole controversy over it) is going to be settled by evidence and argument... something I failed to see throughout the movie.

Eugenie Scott gets a say and she sums it up nicely; ""If they [intelligent design proponents] have a way of understanding nature that is superior to the one we all are making lots of discoveries with, great.  Bring it on.""  And interestingly, there is a heading on the dvd called ""applications"" where some of the IDers talk about how thinking in ID has supposedly given them new insights in their respective fields of research.  For instance, Jonathan Wells talked about centromeres acting like a motor in the cell.  This sounds a lot like the bacterial flagellum example (that has been taken apart by Kenneth Miller, along with their blood-clotting cascade example).  I found that there wasn't anything profound in their perspectives that couldn't be had using an evolutionary one.  If anything, evolutionary biologists point out bad, kludgy designs where things hardly look designed at all.  Presupposing that there is some grand designer behind biology doesn't help scientists trying to understand how nature works.  The IDers haven't 'brought it on'.

In one episode, Wells remarks that evolution can't explain how species change over time.  But there are several counter-examples; finches studies by the Grants, stickleback fish adapting to isolated lakes and streams, 500 species of cichlids evolved in East Africa's Lake Victoria, antibiotic resistance in bacteria, Richard Lenski's experiments on the evolution of E. coli, etc.

Midway through, a somewhat sombre tone develops where Stein looks shaken as he tours an asylum (where the nazis eliminated the mentally-handicapped).  But then he ends by pointing the finger back at 'Darwinism'--completely deflated any sympathies that Stein had just built up in me.  Darwin wasn't any more responsible for nazi atrocities than Christ was responsible for the inquisition.  Playing the Nazi moral card on Darwin is a cheap, flimsy tactic when other arguments seem to have run dry or come up empty.  Major FAIL.

The origins of life section skews what is current in abiogenesis where again, Stein cherry-picks and caricatures some of the more radical ideas in the field.  Take the directed panspermia example promoted by Francis Crick (codiscover of DNA).  Stein remarks deadpan that Crick thinks aliens did it; or he cynically listens to Ruse talk about a crystal substrate as a template for proteins.  His announcement of Miller's attempt to jumpstart? life is a misconstrual of the purpose behind Miller's experiments.

Stein; ""Everyone agrees that life started with a single cell.""  No

Throughout the movie, black and white footage is interjected (from East Berlin to The Planet of the Apes footage to guillotines, etc.) in an attempt to cinematically drive the point home about intolerance, bullying, totalitarianism, etc.  This just seemed all the more revolting and time-wasting in light of all the misrepresentations and straw men one had to endure.  Stein's every-once-in-a-while 'Darwinism' drone is just grating.  And the Casino of Life cartoon where Dawkins is at a slot machine trying to 'win' a protein sequence is the high point of this docu-nonsense.

Other ideas are bandied around in the movie such as eugenics, free will, society.  Certain episodes swing casually from Darwin to Hitler and back again.  Fuller's idea that Darwinism leads to a deprivileging of humans is so off the mark.  If the society is so under the grip of Darwinism, why is there such a current worldwide instillment of human rights then?  You don't see this idea in vogue during the middle ages for example.  What a sloppy history lesson.

A central philosophical theme that seems to underpin the movie is the difference between naturalism and supernaturalism.  Science eschews supernaturalism for the simple reason that naturalistic explanations have produced enormous epistemic success in our understanding of nature while supernatural ones have come up empty.  And this is because supernatural hypotheses can't be subject to empirical testing.  In spite of supposedly showing applications--where thinking intelligent design has lead to new insights or discoveries in the life sciences, the argument could equally be made that these discoveries were the result of thinking natural selection.  Having an intelligent designer (or God) fill in what science can't is just the old God-of-the-gaps argument.  In spite of what Stein suggests to the contrary, religion and science *are* unrelated.

3501497,5,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein presents his case well.  You really understand after this movie why Darwin's theory for the origin of species is just that, a theory.  It cannot be called science because it does not fulfill the requirements of the scientific method (theory/hypothesis, observation, experimentation and conclusion).  The theory of evolution has evolved from theory to ""fact"" according to some ""scientists"" in the film; however, no fact is established without experimentation and there has been not one yet that has substantiated any theory.  Therefore, all opinions on our origins are faith-based, period.

As far as evidence pointing one way or the other, Ben does an excellent job of going from point A to point B in a logical progression.  If evolution is a fact that explains our origins, then it should be able to answer some basic questions and it cannot.  Ben starts asking questions which lead to more questions until the whole thing begins to unravel right before the viewer's eyes.  Evolution as science is exposed as a myth.  It is supported by persons who hold a world view that dictates how they will view any ""evidence"" they find. It is quite likely the same holds true for those examining ""evidence"" from an intelligent design perspective but at least those interviewed in the film were honest about it.

One item that was almost laughable was when a ""scientist"" stated that it was known how abysmal the education is in America and what was certainly not needed was for creationism to be included as ""science"" in the classroom.  Apparently, he didn't recognize the contradition.  Creationism is currently excluded and the education system is currently a disaster according to his own admission.  You will want to hear it in his own words.  Of note is that these scientists (I can't consider them such after listening to them in this film) insisted throughout on equating intelligent design with creationism.  Intelligent design could lead to creationism as defined in the Bible but it could also lead elswhere so to insist so dogmatically that the two were equivalent was disingenuous.  The difference between ID and creationsim was made clear in the film.

Other blunders appear in officious sounding jargon from the various scientists.  Ben doesn't say much.  He just let's them bury themselves with their own words.  I started to feel sorry for them after a bit.

You might find that this movie is disturbing on several levels, especially the connection to Nazi Germany, eugenics, and other rather nasty atrocities foisted on the weak of society all masked as necessary and noble.  Another disturbing implication is the loss of freedom and death the victims suffered as a result of ""superior"" minds having decided what was for the ""best"" where they were concerned.  Ben doesn't blast you with it, but he certainly lets you get the picture.  Our beliefs WILL dictate how we view others and how we will subsequently treat others.

It seems Ben Stein's primary arguments against the theory of evolution are that it causes nazi regimes to do unspeakable things, and that it doesn't fully explain the origin of life on the planet.  It also seems that his primary argument as to why intelligent design is a better theory is because evolutionists do not like to talk about it.  I find it more likely that the scientists who blow off the ID crowd do so not because they have something to hide (as implied in the movie) but because they have more pertinent things to do than entertain bad ideas--like researching cures for cancer.

3501521,1,B001BYLFFS,"Pretending to be ""fair and balanced"" this pile of garbage intends to take advantage of people's tolerance to sell the idea that Intelligent Design should be taught in schools as ""the other side of the story"".
The problem is that Creationism (=ID) is not even a theory. Creationists lack anything even remotely like a theory so all they have is ""Evilution doesn't explain this and that"". If you want to silence a Creationist, just ask him to explain the Scientific Theory of Intelligent Design without mentioning Evolution - he will have nothing to say, unless he reads Genesis.
Teaching Creationism would be even worse than teaching Geocentrism, Alchemy and Numerology.
Also, why did Ben Stein EXPELL any mention to the real father of Nazi Ideology, Martin Luther, who wrote a book called The Jews and Their Lies espousing things like:

""First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them.

This is to be done in honor of our Lord and Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, blaspheming of his son and of his Christians....

Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed...""

After all, if Hitler really thought he was accelerating ""EVOLUTION"", it Makes no sense to exterminate the people who gave us Einstein. But Hitler of course was a true God-believer who banned Atheism from Germany. To be a Nazi you had to believe in a Higher Power, otherwise you'd be EXPELLED from the Nazi party! Hitler was a Creationist.
Ben Stein strangely expells this info from his lying movie. He also expells the fact that Christians held slaves and fostered Apartheid and Segregation for centuries.

3501522,1,B001BYLFFS,"All I can say is that the movie is flawed at many levels. However, as a propaganda piece it is well-constructed. It presents a loosely associated rhetorical progression as if it were a reasoned argument. I could see how it might bolster the beliefs of those already in agreement with the position that Stein takes, but it really isn't likely to persuade anyone to change their beliefs. There are quite a few things that could be said here, but one irony that does seem pertinent is that the concept of eugenics seems to me to be more compatible with Intelligent Design than with evolution. Evolution describes a basic natural phenomenon, whereas Intelligent Design is about interfering with the natural progression of organisms. Another thing that strikes me as odd is the association between Nazism and atheism that Stein asserts. In the USA all the Nazis that I'm aware of are racist, bible-thumping fundamentalists. So I'm just not seeing any of Steins social assertions as even remotely accurate. As for science, he's way off base.

This documentary shows how various individuals who have advocated Intelligent Design theory in academia have been systematically booted from the system, denied tenure, or otherwise harassed.  The documentary shows interviews with a wide variety of individuals both for and against Darwinism.  Most of those who question the legitimacy of Darwinism in the documentary do not appear to be rigid fundamentalists but rather thoughtful individuals who see problems in a dogmatically held theory.  Interestingly it is pointed out by a Polish professor that in Poland this sort of controversy is less pronounced than in the United States in that Poland is not so subject to political correctness.  Some of Stein's comparisons may be questionable, but this film offers quite a bit of food for thought about such questions as the nature of science and academic freedom.  Certainly this film has added quite a bit to the growing and continuing debate between those who advocate Intelligent Design and Darwinism.  It is highly interesting for that reason if no other.",1238803200,12,1230,5.436842105263158
3501538,5,B001BYLFFS,"As a Boeing 747 captain, I marvel at the incredible blindness of those who cannot see intelligent design in the composition of all nature. According to their myopic view, my 820,000 lb. aircraft, composed of some four million parts working together in perfect harmony, just randomly assembled itself into a flying machine. Yep, no intelligent design there; stray winds ripped through a scrap yard assembling a melange of parts into an aircraft capable of transporting over 500 passengers safely from one place to another.
 Yet, the 747, a product of undoubtable intelligent human design is far inferior to a living bird. One only has to look at, for example, the various species of Birds of Paradise of New Guinea to ask them themselves, ""If undirected evolution were true, how is it that these birds evolved such spectacular plumage which leads to their eventual extinction? In order to ensure survival of the species, why didn't these birds evolve drab plumage so the natives wouldn't slaughter them to use their spectacular feathers in headdresses?""
 Ben Stein, in his epic, ""Expelled,"" rightly  castigates  those who, in their selective blindness, cannot see the obvious which ever stares them right in the face. Imagine how safe you'd feel if airline pilots ignored the indications of their instruments, (each of which gives the pilot a valid indication of the regime of flight).

3501544,4,B001BYLFFS,"This movie details Ben Stein's quest to discover if there is any sense to the idea of Intelligent Design and if there is a concerted effort on the part of established science to stifle any honest debate about Intelligent Design.  The movie does a very good job in illustrating that much of the bias against Intelligent Design does not come from a scientific standpoint, but rather from a philosophical bias against non-scientific claims to truth (AJ Ayers lives again).  There is also a good amount of religion bashing throwing in.

The best part of the movie is when Ben Stein interviews Richard Dawkins (one of the current poster children of the atheist movement and scientist of some worth).  Dawkins has a smarmy smirk on his face when he begins talking with Stein, but quickly realizes that Stein is no idiot and that Stein is asking hard questions.  It is worth watching the movie just to see Stein corner Dawkins into claiming that the idea that aliens from outer-space planted life on earth is a more rational explanation than a creator!

3501559,5,B001BYLFFS,"Many (if not most) people have their minds made up on the evolution/intelligent design debate.  Those who believe evolution is a lie from the pit of hell will be nodding in agreement with this movie, though they might wish it went for the jugular more.  Those who feel think evolution is science (""pretend might be a more accurate word than ""think"") and have no problem with the undemocratic, un-American, anti-intellectual, and dictatorial monopoly evolution has on science and education will hate this movie, give it one star reviews, and consider any positive reviews to be unhelpful.  Thus, please read this review regardless of the number of unhelpful votes I get and see for yourself.

Let me start with the purpose of this movie.  It is not meant to show the errors of evolution, though it does.  It is not meant to convert people to the intelligent design camp.  It is not meant to be a lawyer trying to get evolution to be proven guilty or ""ID"" to be proven to be fact.  Rather, the purpose is to encourage honest debate on the issue.  True, this movie focuses on the ID side and the problems with evolution, but that's because evolution is the side that's in power and not wanting a debate.  (If one believes evolution is fact, then they would welcome the challenge of another view and not try to keep it quiet, but let the facts speak.)

I only saw one review when this movie was out -- actually, just part of the USA Today review, which called it ""Propoganda . . . a political rant . . . .""  One can say the same thing about any Michael Moore documentary, but my hunch is the reviewer will have a more positive spin.  (By the way, there is a coming attraction for a Michael Moore film with this video.)  I have not seen any of Michael's films yet (I actually kind of like him, and I'm afraid I won't if I see more of him!), but my wife and I watched ""Expelled"" with my father, who has seen ""Sicko"" and ""Farrenheit 9/11"".  He said ""Expelled"" was better than Moore's movies -- partially because Moore doesn't get his facts right and partially that ""Expelled"" is not mean-spirited like Moore is.

The truth is that this is not a political rant, unless one views abortion and euthenasia to be political rather than moral.  Ben Stein points out that the debate is at least as much one of worldview than of science, and that evil (e.g. Nazism) can be based on Darwinianism (though Stein more than once points out that not all evolutionists are Nazis or evil).

Let's move from the message to the movie itself.  There is plenty of humor in the movie.  The satire is more Horatian than Juvenalian -- it is not insulting (though some evolutionists manage to make monkeys out themselves on camera).  The PG rating warns of disturbing issues -- later in the movie, it moves from semi-humorous to more serious.

From the start of the movie the Berlin Wall is used as a metaphor of the lack of debate.  This movie is focused more on freedom.  I wish everyone would watch it with an open mind.

One last comment.  I noticed the tag suggestions, which includes ""progaganda"", ""creationism"" (though this movie hardly deals with that view), ""lies"", ""deception"", ""trash"", ""madness"", and ""anti-Semitism"" (which is ironic, because Stein is Jewish and the anit-Semitism he mentions is a result of some evolutionists).  There is no positive tag suggestion.  I think the person who suggested the tags forgot to turn his brain on when looking at the movie.",1237248000,14,3443,4.609195402298851

He claims to be the victims in a ""war on religion"" when they are a part of the majority. He fails to mention that the ""wedge Strategy"" document from the Dover Trials from the ""Discovery Institute"" which has a purely Machiavellian agenda that specifically states that ID in schools is the first step to restoring prayer in school after re-defining scientific theory and science through public opinion by lying and intentionally misleading the public. All throughout this my wife and I couldn't help but notice that the documentary, like ""intelligent Design"" makes a truckload of claims without ever offering concrete examples, evidence or proof.

That is what I'm encouraging you to do: MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND on this product. If you allow others to make conclusions for you than you have allowed them to steal from you your right to critically think.

  Ben Stein has done a good job of presenting the case for intelligent design, and for exposing certain leanings within the scientific community to silence it. Of course you are ultimately the one who has to make up your own mind if Steins argument holds water or not. This film should not in and of it self polarize your opinion to one pole or the other. What it should do is make you start to enquire into this subject matter. You should then look at BOTH sides of the argument and finally draw your conclusion. NO ONE CAN DO THIS FOR YOU!!! Don't let anyone say ANYTHING without fact checking them. There are many an individual who gets away with intellectual murder because others take them at their word. On this subject you can't do that.

As Stein alludes in his film, there must be more at stake on this intellectual beach head than simply upholding an old scientific theory.  (I personally believe that the Darwinians' high level of emotion over this issue is ultimately rooted in their desire (or need?) to explain away God.  After all, if there is some type of Designer, we might be accountable to It.  This isn't something that Stein pursues in the film.)",1235692800,9,838,5.072992700729927

3501603,4,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein does a great job of allowing scientists to speak for themselves and share their beliefs regarding science, religion, and evolution. Through these conversations you get to see a side of the scientific community that is not often publicized and it makes you think about what is going on behind the scenes.

It is important to keep in mind as you watch the DVD that Ben Stein is not trying to give scientific debates for or against anyone's beliefs; all he is trying to do is point to the prejudice, bias, and monopolies that are occurring in the scientific community that are disrupting the core philosophies that science must have to function properly.

Science is the pursuit of truth regarding the universe and how it functions. Scientists study the natural world and create explanations for its natural phenomena; these explanations must in turn be backed by further empirical evidence including accurate predictions. For example, the changes in understandings of the solar system from Plato to Einstein took place because each scientist challenged the accepted view of the solar system, presented a new model, and demonstrated how their new model fit the evidence better and increased the accuracy of predictions.

It is important to remember that scientific explanations are only glimpses of the truth found in nature and are not to be confused with truth themselves. Scientific explanations are created by imperfect humans with limited understandings of the universe. Therefore, as new data and understandings continually become available to the scientific community, it must be used to question the accuracy of all its adopted theories. Every scientific theory must be continually questioned, tested for accuracy, and revised to ensure that science moves forward in the pursuit of truth. For example, when Mendel and Darwin made their explanations for genetics and evolution, they knew nothing about DNA and had none of the genetic studies we have today. Their theories therefore must be analyzed and updated to fit this new body of genetic knowledge.

Therefore, this DVD shows what happens when the process of review and revision is halted. In that moment, science ceases to be the pursuit of truth and becomes a stagnant religion of people holding on to what they want to believe as the only acceptable explanation. They silence any who question their precious theories even if they bring up valid concerns regarding assumptions in the theory, personal biases driving a theory's support, data that the theory cannot account for, evidence conflicting with the theory, or more accurate alternatives to the theory. It is in these sorts of ""belief and support at all cost"" monopolies that science dies until one day, someone can break through the void like Einstein, Galileo, Mendel, or Darwin and rip science out of the dark ages and send it again moving forward, towards the pursuit of truth.

On a personal note: The movie had a side focus on anti-semitism and the holocaust. I feel this was done to show what happens when you take away people's rights, label someone as less in worth, silence a people group's voice, or take certain scientific theories in evolution to their extremes. I do not feel that the documentary needed to go in that direction, but the topic really did make you think. Today, people's voices are being silenced and looked down upon for their religious beliefs all while Darwinism is put on an unquestioned pedestal. That is the same climate that led to the holocaust.",1235520000,10,3510,5.0657439446366785

I noticed that the naysayers among the reviewers are pretty much all guilty of using the false-distinction logical fallacy ""science vs. religion,"" when the criteria SHOULD be ""evidence for creation"" vs. ""evidence for evolution."" But then, it's an over-used, logically-flawed tactic used by atheists and evolutionists to make us thing evolution = science, which it is not.

Evolution is a belief about the past, just like creation, that can neither be proved or disproved in the laboratory or under a microscope. Both theories look at the same evidence, but reach different conclusions.",1235433600,7,629,5.217821782178218

3501628,5,B001BYLFFS,"When we tuck our boys in at night we often count our blessings. It's a blessing we try not to take for granted that we live in a country where someone can make a documentary critical of some institution and not have it banned. Micheal Moore's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 for example was pretty critical of President Bush. He need not fear persecution over the film however, he lives in a free country. Unfortunately the education institution has some 'evolving' to do. They have put a gag order on the terms 'intelligently designed' and 'irreducibly complex.' But independent, think for yourself children, will see it anyway. As this illustration demonstrates.

Another night time routine for us is to read night time stories. Science books are always a favorite. We have a great book on the human body. The first chapter is on the cell. The cell is the star of the documentary Expelled No Intelligence Allowed. In the book Human Body, a blown up view of the cell shows us something amazing. The cell is hideously complex. My son points to the painting of DNA at the nucleus of the cell and asks what it is. I tell him it is the information for the function, replication, and behavior of the cell. He point to the rungs in the ladder of the double helix and asks what they do. I tell him it's a 4 letter alphabet that has the information of 100,000 pages worth of biological language. The instructions. As he gazes at the page the fact that the words, intelligently designed and irreducibly complex are not found in the text is in material. He 'sees' it. Children are visual learners.

Recalling our science book on the elements, he asks how it is that those tiny atoms that make up everything in the universe came to make a cell without the instructions in the beginning. I tell him some people believe it's like a tornado ripping through a junkyard and assembling a Boeing 747 airplane. [So long as there is a 'possibility' of it happening everything is considered. Empirical evidence simply means ""applied materialist philosophy."" The peer reviews are only going to enforce the orthodoxy.]  Recalling our science book on weather and the pictures of the devastation caused by tornadoes, he's confused now. So I asked him if he would ride in a plane that was made by a tornado ripping through the junkyard. He says to me, ""Only if God were flying it.""

Children can think deeper than we give them credit for. He wonders if a tornado hit a junkyard that was filled up with discarded computer parts, ""Would that make a flying saucer?"" Recalling the DVD expelled and the debate between Ben Stein and Richard Dawkins I exclaim, ""Eureka, if it could, we would have a vehicle to take life to a new part of the Universe!""

3501631,2,B001BYLFFS,"I give this ""film"" two stars for the simple reason that it is a great piece of pure propaganda and nothing more. It is, as many have stated, an insult to the intelligence of everyone or watches and can stomach through it, be they religious believer or not. Ben Stein doesn't know anything about science nor do the makers of this film. It is not just that they don't understand evolution, they don't understand the scientific method. Something isn't true or not because of the moral implications of it being true, that is basic logic. If the Nazis used evolution to justify the holocaust(which they didn't) it doesn't make it not true! If I use relativity theory to justify murder, that doesn't mean gravity isn't true! People use God to justify murder, doesn't make God not true. Ben Stein states that evolution doesn't explain gravity and other scientific subjects. Yes, because evolution describes the origins of the various species, it doesn't pretend to explain a field entirely seperate from itself! Then there is the fact that there was more to these cases of these scientists supposedly fired. It is an utter travesty in the 21st century that this movie is taken seriously. Also left unexplained is the supposed designer. A designer will have to be more complex then his designed cause. In fact, scientists featured in this film were EXPELLED from screenings. How ironic. Future generations will look back at this movie and wonder what the people of our time were thinking. This movie was based purely on pushing creationism, nothing more.

  As I said before, one of the main problems with this film is that it does not understand the fact that something is not true or not because of the implications of it being true or not. For example, in its' attempts to connect the Nazis with evolution, it does not understand that if some individuals used Darwin to promote Nazism does not mean that Evolution or Natural Selection or to use the term it uses throughout the film, Darwnism, is not true. At best it is an argument why it should not be true or believed to be true but not on the question is it true or not. For example, if belief in quantum mechanics led to someone committing violence against another, that doesn't make quantum mechanics true or not. If a Christian commits violence, it does not make Christianity untrue. Ironically in its' attempt to argue against evolution based on some who might have believed in it using it as a justification for the Nazi regime, it ignores the fact that while many Christians opposed the Nazis, some though unfortnately supported and even helped vote them into office in 1933. It ignores the fact that Germany in 1933 was heavily religious (much more then today). That of course does not make Christianity untrue, just as evolution is not untrue because of some of the actions of some who might have believed in it or took actions by misinterpeting it to justify their actions, as some individuals have done with the Christian religion.

The film while a supposed critique of evolution does not touch on that subject. Its' criticisms when it deals with the actual subject matter of science is critiques on abiogensis, the origins of life. But, evolution is true or not based on its' own evidence, not on where the origins of life came from. They are two different fields of biology. For example, it is well known that there are electrons in atoms but the idea that matter is composed of strings is very much still debated. That matter is composed of string or not doesn't mean that atoms don't have electrons. One is settled science and one is not. Second, any supposed designer of life begs the question who is this designer. If it is a deity, then where did this deity come from. If the answer is it is a matter of faith then one must ask why should science be involved in matters of faith? If the supposed answer to a scientific question is one that creates more problems then the supposed solution, is it a good scientific explanation? Second, if the supposed designer is an alien being or race then who again (like the deity) caused or created them? But those who support ID for the most part don't take seriously the idea that life was started by alien beings. Like most ID supporters (though not all) they believe that the earth and life was created about or less then 10,000 years ago. Expelled is a movie that wishes to promote a view of the earth being 10,000 years old or less but doesn't want to say it directly. Those who view the film are much more likely to believe in a ""Young Earth"" then the US population at large. So, the language of Intelligent Design is used to appeal to more Americans then it would if it would just say the earth is less then 10,000 years old.

Evolution itself, like any science, does not deal with the subject of evolution. It only deals with observations and other tools of science. Something that doesn't use a scientific approach isn't science even if it is by chance true. If a designer cannot be tested and gives a solution to a problem (where does the designer come from for instance) more complicated then the problem itself there is no scientific reason to believe in it.

The film in a pre-screening ironically expelled one of the pro-evolutionist scientists that it had interviewed for the film. So much for irony. Dr. PJ Myers was made to leave the screening of the film though he had reserved seating and gave his and all other members of his party, accurate names.
Dr. Myers is one of the scientists (along with Dr. Richard Dawkins) that the producers of the film tricked by misleading them it was differing kind of documentary.

Ben Stein and the makers of the film in contrast to pro-evolution scientists and writers such as Dr. Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens etc refuse to go on radio or tv talk shows where their views might be challenged by a non softball question. Dawkins, Hitchens and others on that side commonly go on shows where they have to defend their point of view. In other words their arguments are strenghtened because that environment (or criticism) forces them to defend their views making them more even more reasoned out and stronger. Ironically kind of like natural selection or ""Darwinism"" in action. The film also reportedly made cost $20 million to make much more then its' earnings of around $7 million even though it was heavily promoted by conservatives on the radio.

This movie lies about the Miller experiment in the 1950s that produced amino acids of a simulated early earth. The film simply says the experiment ""failed."" While the chemicals and the atmosphere was more complex then the 1950s experiment, modern experiments with a more complex atmosphere that simulates an early earth have created amino acids. In fact, this shows that the creation of amino acids is pretty common. In fact we know this to be true because amino acids that are from outer space have been found.

Ben Stein and his fellow Intelligent designers try to pretend that they could just as easily be talking about aliens as a deity but they mock a scientist who proposed that life could be seeded by aliens. Stein also mocks in the movie and post interviews, Dr. Richard Dawkins, who was asked by Stein if there was a designer what did he believe the designer to be like. Dawkins said aliens was most likely designer but again, there would have to be a natural cause for even that kind of alien designer. Dawkins did not believe (as Stein blately lies) that aliens seeded the earth but what was most likely designer. This example is just symbolic for the greater lieing and distorting that this propangda happens to be.

This movie is what it is, it bashes evolution through associating it with atheists. The movie makers' understand that atheists are a despised group, especially among those who believe in creationism and who will watch this film. So, it associates atheists with evolution even though most Americans who believe in evolution also believe in a deity. After all, only about 10% of Americans lack a belief in a deity but about 50% believe in evolution. Even if only atheists believed in evolution that wouldnt' be an argument against evolution, which again is settled based on the evidence for or against it. Not what people want to believe.",1235001600,3,8279,4.7152729785763645

3501664,5,B001BYLFFS,"Indeed, what is so scary about asking questions? The point of ""Expelled"" is that nothing should be so sacred that it can't stand scrutiny; that is, Darwin's theories on how life developed.

I wouldn't say Darwin's theories on how life was created, because Darwin never actually gets into how life came about. Ben Stein asks modern-day evolution proponents how they think life came about, first causes, and gets an amusing variety of answers: life piggybacked onto ""crystals""; then there's my favorite, that aliens came here and spread their seed.

Uh huh. Aliens.

It amazes me the crap evolution proponents will believe, although if you look at hollywood, it's clear we do have aliens here now. The problem is that they aren't only NOT a superior race, they're mentally defective.

But I digress.

The main thrust of ""Expelled"" isn't proving that there's an Intelligent Designer as much as it is, why can't the questions be raised? Why do scientists who aren't in lockstep with the prevailing scientific ethos of the day be allowed to question Darwininian beliefs without paying for it by having their reputations intentionally smeared, and being banned from their jobs?

So...why? What happened to scientific inquiry, the idea of following an idea wherever it leads?

If you have an open mind, Stein and his documentary brings up some very interesting questions, questions that won't disappear when the film ends. I'd sure like to know the answers - not just if there is an Intelligent Designer, but why the scientific community is so AFRAID of anyone who dares to challenge their long-held beliefs.

It is truly amazing that the intellects that created and propagate the currently held views about the big bang and the origins of man, cannot grasp the irony inherent in their intelligently designed theories. What are the laws that govern randomness? Even more interesting, nowhere in evolutionary theory is the subject of the origins of human consciousness addressed. Wasn't it the faculty of human consciousness that designed the theory of evolution? Should this matter? Watch this video!!!",1232323200,5,767,5.295081967213115
3501679,5,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein narrates and stars in Expelled, and the script represents his thoughts. That makes it personal and easy to relate to. The editing is tight, the tone is generally light, and points are illustrated with very amusing (sometimes very literal) old black-and-white newsreel or movie footage driving the idea home. This is a very hip movie, stylistically. But some may consider the subject matter very uncool. The film may get high points on style, but what about the substance?

I believe much of the criticism of Expelled is quite misplaced. The purpose of the documentary was not to delve into the scientific support for the intelligent design (ID) hypothesis. The theme here is freedom of thought and speech. Is it possible for an academic to discuss the evidence of biology, biochemistry, genetics, paleontology, physics, cosmology with reference to the possibility of intelligent design in some features of the natural world? The answer appears to be no. Not if you want to keep your job, make tenure, continue to get research grants, and avoid persecution and belittling criticism from powerful academic forces.

The question posed is not whether the factual evidence favors intelligent design or unguided, random, natural forces. The question is whether one is allowed to present any argument or evidence in favor of design, or to discuss possible flaws or failings in current evolutionary theory.

Have our universities become intolerant of free discussion? Has modern science put blinders on when it comes to anything that might hint of the influence of a higher power or an outside intelligence? Ultra-atheist Richard Dawkins sort of gives away the show at the end. Ben Stein leads Dawkins into a marvelous trap, and Dawkins cannot see that he has defeated his own argument. Dawkins literally admits the possibility of ID, and as long as God isn't involved, he'd be cool with it. This is the same stance as the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Francis Crick who proposed that life was seeded on earth from outer space, possibly from an alien intelligence. Intelligent design by any other name would be as intelligent and as much designed. The subtitle of the movie is ""No Intelligence Allowed."" But what's really meant is that no possibility of a divine involvement in the mechanical world will even be considered by the academic gatekeepers.

Within the limits of the subject -- academic freedom to discuss possible design features of the natural world -- the film is a brilliant success. Yes, it is biased. But if there is a bias, let it be in favor of free speech. If ID is truly a nutty idea, let it be exposed for what it is -- in open debate. That's what Ben Stein's vision of America would allow for, and I believe that matches the desires of a majority of Americans.

The party line among the scientific establishment is that ID is merely creationism slyly repackaged. The party line is that evolution is a fact. We don't argue about whether gravity exists, and we don't tolerate classroom discussion of whether or not objects fall toward a massive body. Therefore ID in the classroom is out of the question. And yet, the actual case for Darwin seems to be so weak that science textbooks must resort to misdirection, distortion, and even fraud to indoctrinate students in that theory -- see Jonathan Wells' book Icons of Evolution for proof. On the other hand, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that complex systems like a bacterial flagellum or the light gathering function of the retina of the human eye can be formed by random mutations and natural selection. Such a demonstration has not really been attempted in the scientific literature. Most of the body plans of the species alive today on the earth appear in the fossil record in the short span of about 5 or 10 million years during the Cambrian period (500 million years ago). Most of these body plans do not have any obvious ancestors in the fossils preceding them. The ""science"" of Darwinism is much shakier than most people imagine. These are legitimate scientific questions. That is a subject for another film, a film I hope that Ben Stein will be willing to undertake now that Expelled has become one of the top 20 documentaries in history.

Science is not a dispassionate arena of pure fact. The scientific establishment and the government behemoth that funds it are not immune to fads and biases. Darwinism is the fad of the 20th century, but it's looking more and more ragged around the edges as discoveries in genetics, biochemistry, and paleontology begin to mount. If we want our students to be truly educated -- to see the world as it really is, not as those with philosophical axes to grind would have us see it -- then there must be open debate. Scientists and professors need to be able to voice non-mainstream concerns without it leading to professional suicide. That's what we've got today. It's not the way of freedom, it is not the path to truth, and it's not American.",1232323200,6,4983,4.856470588235294

Of course, the suppression of ID finds justification--but so do all attempts to stifle free expression. We are reminded of the Berlin Wall and Communist thought control.

Are science and academia really so fragile that they may collapse if ID proponents were welcomed--or at least tolerated, even if they be deemed completely wrong or ""incompetent""? Do we really need a rationalistic thought police to suppress dissent by firing nonconformist thinkers?

EXPELLED is careful to present all sides of this issue. Against the accusation of the ID being a front for the much-demonized Religious Right, we hear from ID-scientist Paul Nelson that he got exactly zero dollars from Jerry Falwell, and that the most dangerous thing he ever did was teach Sunday School. We also learn that many of the ID proponents aren't even Christians.

Some of the statements of the interviewees are priceless. We hear Michael Ruse insisting that non-design explanations are absolutely factual, yet, in order to account for the origin of living systems, he cannot go beyond vague speculations about molecules attaching themselves to crystals.  Militant British atheist Richard Dawkins is even better. He goes on and on about how religion and design are long-disproved superstitions.

3501684,4,B001BYLFFS,"I just finished watching Ben Stein's documentary film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, and wanted to post a quick word about it as it will now be appearing on TIBM's recommended resources page.  In short, I found the film to be compelling, entertaining, and just well-made.  You probably are already aware of the gist of Expelled, so I won't belabor that here.  It's enough to simply mention that the film is a expos of the current conspiracy within mainline academia to suppress the concept of intelligent design (ID).  Stein does a great job of showing how academic freedom is under attack in this country by the Darwinian lobby.  He really makes that the central issue of the film.  Actually, I don't see this as a movie about ID as much as it is a movie about censorship.  Stein's real argument is that ID-based discussion, inquiry, debate, argument, and instruction is being systematically and unreasonably banned from academic institutions in the United States.  The opponents of ID featured in Expelled seem to agree that such a ban is in effect, but they deny that this is unreasonable.
  Well, is it unreasonable to ""expel"" ID from our nation's academic institutions?  This is undeniably the case.  After all, ID is essentially a theory of the origins of the universe (and especially of biological life).  Darwinian evolution on the other hand is not a theory of the origin of life.  Darwinism rather attempts to argue that all species evolved over time from a common biological ancestor.  How that earliest ancestor came into being in the first place, however, is not answered by the theory.  Even if we were to accept the idea that all life in our world evolved from a single living cell over billions of years, we still must ask where that cell came from.  So, at the very least, I'd say it is unreasonable to ban a scientific theory without providing something in its place.  Of course, even as I write these words I notice how scary and, well, un-American the phrase ""ban a scientific theory"" sounds.
  Before I leave this topic, I thought I should give you a heads up of the kind of feedback you might get from Darwinists that hate Stein's film just because it exists.  If you chose to make use of this film in any kind of outreach or apologetics training setting or if you try to get your skeptic friends to watch it, you are eventually going to get negative feedback from ID opponents.  I just want to warn you to be careful about how you pick your battles.  Mostly, it seems that people want to criticize Stein and make allegations about how the film was made.  They call Stein ignorant, a meanie, and charge him with using unethical methods for obtaining interviews, etc.  This just simply isn't where the war should be fought.  For all I know, Ben Stein could be a complete horse's rear who interviewed people at knifepoint.  But really, what does that have to do with anything?  Is Richard Dawkins claiming to not believe what he is quoted as saying in film?  Is anyone else?
  The bulk of the arguments that you get from Darwinists, of course, aren't really arguments at all.  Here's a nice sample quote:

""Stein is arguing for a position that no one who knows what they are talking about agrees with.  Intelligent design is not a legitimate scientific position . . . if it wasn't for the Bible, we wouldn't have this intelligent design ****.""  -- Neotropic9 (YouTube Vlogger)

I hope you can see how this isn't an argument.  It's like saying to a person who doesn't agree with you, ""Well, you're just stupid and I'm not going to be your friend anymore."" Now, I'm not a scientist, but on what basis is ID not a legitimate scientific position?  Well, Neotropic9 would just have us take his word for it.  And of course, if the force of your completely unsupported claim doesn't convince someone to believe your position, you certainly should cuss a little bit. A potty mouth is always a sure sign of an intelligent argument.
  Well, if you haven't watched the film, go rent it or buy it.  If you have, I'd love to know what you think.  Leave your comments below!

3501705,4,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein is the Intelligent Designer for this story. It starts out by showing a military operation - the building of the Berlin Wall, a symbol of political control. Stein questions the Scientific Establishment (which is controlled by Big Corporations, but they can't tell you this). Freedom is what makes America great. But Stein says scientists are not allowed to consider Intelligent Design. Richard von Sternberg Ph. D. was fired from the Smithsonian for printing an article that questioned the unproven theory of Darwin. [Most Universities were created by Robber Barons in the late 19th century to control thinking for their benefit. State Universities are also controlled by corporate flunkies.] This film lists the many scientists who were purged for questioning Darwinism. This is not new; in the 1920s both William J. Bryan and Upton Sinclair criticized the control of Universities by corporations.

Darwin's theory is unscientific because it claims something unproven and says it can never be questioned. A history of science would show how science evolved its beliefs over the centuries. We don't know how life arose on Earth. Darwin knew nothing about genes. Darwin's unscientific assumptions live on because they serve the policies for corporate control of society. Darwin can't be questioned anymore than capitalist control of society, though neither existed much before the 19th century. Before that it was forbidden to question the ""divine right"" of kings or aristocrats. There are many stories of political oppression. More freedom in Poland than in America?

Does Official Science lead to nihilism, a belief in nothing or self-destructive behavior? Is it a form of thought control? Should religion be controlled like guns or drugs? What transcendental beliefs would take its place? Does Darwinism lead to a Nazi society? Or is that from Eugenics or Malthus? Are there many people who think like that today? [Ever listen to the gossips on talk radio?] ""Planned Parenthood"" is a descendant of Eugenics, another form of political oppression of people. Darwin is quoted as the basis for Eugenics, the planned elimination of certain people. Science knows that a poor diet (such as a lack of iodine) is responsible for birth defects. Economic oppression is the main cause a poor diet.

Ben Stein attempted to interview some people and got a run-around. Censorship? He finds an Iron Curtain of silence or denial of what happened. [They can't discuss their orders from above?] Stein asks if anyone else will raise the question of thought control. Would you sign the Freedom of Speech petition for academic freedom? Does the study of cell structure suggest intelligent design? Why is there a controversy on this topic? Since all countries control their borders the Berlin Wall may not be a good example. Would the McCarthyism of the 1950s be a better example? Michael Crichton's novel ""State of Fear"" has an appendix on Eugenics.

Lewis suggested years ago - i.e., the jump from the edge of the pond and into it is called a ""leap of faith"" or a religion.

That's the excuse parents sometimes hear when kids bring home bad grades. In many cases, the real reason for failure is a consistent lack of effort.

In the movie ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,"" Ben Stein profiles advocates of ""Intelligent Design"" (ID) who claim that their ideas are being unfairly suppressed. What Stein doesn't tell you is that ID advocates have consistently failed to do the work required to pass muster within the scientific community.

The problem for ID advocates isn't that their ideas are being suppressed. It's that they haven't even tried to develop their ideas into a viable scientific research program. They haven't been expelled, they have flunked!

And now, in order to distract you from all those zeroes in the grade book, they have made a dishonest (and unbearably boring) movie about how much the teacher hates them.

The last part of the movie is an sit down interview with Dawkins. Dawkins almost has more talking time than Stein.

What I love about it is that it's a search for the truth. Using a lot of cold war ideas, and terminology, Ben Stein simply asks the questions, no one else will answer. Why is it not ok for there to be different points of view. And he encurages us to question what we're taught and told to accept as fact, regardless of where the information came from.

After that, he does look into evolution, and what rabid darwinian evolutionists believe(d) and what those beliefs led them to do. However, it's simple facts.

3501714,5,B001BYLFFS,"This film is not so much an argument for Intelligent Design theory but rather an expose of the spanish-inquistion-like way the mainstream scientific community seeks out and destroys all heretics to their godless religion.

I am not a proponent of ""Intelligent Design"" because it is not really a scientific theory but a bunch of people going around saying ""no it isn't"".  You can't find two people that can describe ""Intelligent Design"" the same way.  (Are they saying that the initial cell was designed intelligently and then evolved into all life forms after that, or are they saying that every single species was designed intelligently as is, or is it something in between?  How do we explain it - what mechanism was used?  How do we test it?).

Still, Darwin's theory has a lot of holes and has led to a lot of Junk Science.  (Do Junk DNA, Vestigal Organs, Bacteria ""evolving"" to be antibiotic resistant"", ""Embryology reflects Ontology"", Eugenics, or Moths that evolve from white to black ring a bell?)

Here are a couple of things I don't get about the Scientific community:

1. Darwin writes this broad sweeping manifesto entitled, ""Origin of the Species"" which contains a lot of big conclusions that are not supported by any real data at the time of it's writing (DNA wasn't even discovered and cells were still thought to be ""simple"") and it is accepted widely and no one is allowed to question it.  In modern times, the peer review process is so strict that even the slightest word or phrase that is not directly supported by the data presented in the paper will cause the entire paper to be sent back for re-write.

2. Darwin did NOT invent the concept of evolution - it was a well-defined concept already and there were alternate theories already in existance.  One of the more famous theories was that of Lamark, who said that as organisms interact with and adapt to their environment, they pass those adaptations onto their off-spring. (Of course this theory is most often cited in order to hold it up for ridicule).  Darwin was simply the first person to suggest that the process of evolution is driven by Natural Selection.

3. Natural Selection by itself CANNOT account for the sheer amount of diversity in the world.  Natural Selection does not PRODUCE change - it actually eliminates a lot of potential change.  Saying Natural Selection drives evolution is like saying the reason we have such a large diversity of books in print of all different topics in all different language is because we have editors that serve to limit the number of books that get printed.

It is because of this 3rd point that other scientists have come along and said that random mutation is the cause of diversity and natural selection ensures only good mutations survive.  The problem is that there are not enough random mutations to account for all of the diversity.

However, as the ""simple cell"" continues to be examined by molecular biologists we are starting to see that much of the ""Junk DNA"" actually serves important functions.  Also, the DNA of the cell was once thought to be the brains of the cell that told the rest of the cell what to do.  Now, we are starting to see that there is a complex series of protien interactions that are used by the cell to determine what genes will be transcribed and in what quantity.  The entire cell acts as a tiny little super computer that reacts to outside stimulus, makes computations and then accesses the DNA (which is more like a data storage unit) and makes the needed proteins to resolve the problem.  Scientists have also seen examples where the cell can actually edit its own DNA by rearranging genes to create new genes. Some examples:

1. Transposons in Bacteria (also referred to as ""jumping genes"") - the bacteria were seen to move a piece of their DNA chromosone from one position to another.  This resulted in the creation of new proteins that the bacteria couldn't produce otherwise.

2. Fruit flies subjected to extreme conditions were shown to produce strange mutations (such as legs growing out of their eye sockets).  The scientists were able to isolate a protein that was produced by the fruit flies only when under extreme stress that induced the cell to rearrange sequences of its DNA.

3. B-cells which produce antibodies use a relatively short sequence of their genetic code to produce antibodies to millions of different antigens.  They do this by rearranging this sequence of DNA to produce an unlimited number of unique gene products.

These are but a few examples of cells altering their genetic code in direct result to changes in the environment, allowing them to adapt.  These changes in many cases CAN be passed onto the next generation.

3501738,1,B001BYLFFS,"The impetus behind this film rests on the much heated debate on teaching Intelligent Design in the classroom [K-12], or why shouldn't it be taught, as a scientific theory, alongside Darwinian evolution? Ben Stein asks: ""Is this some kind of scientific conspiracy, or worse, censorship?""

For starter, let's set something straight...

Darwinian evolution is a scientific theory concerning macroevolution, or speciation. It is NOT a scientific theory on the origin(s) of all life, which is what Intelligent Design is supposedly addressing. In other words, I.D. is a hypothesis about 'the Beginning,' whereas Evolution is a scientific theory about what happened after 'the Beginning.'

Note that in the scientific community, a scientific hypothesis, a scientific theory, and a scientific law have different meanings. What a layperson would consider a ""theory"" is not the same as a scientific theory. A 'scientific theory' needs to be 1) supported by empirical evidence and 2) stand the tests of falsification.

So when people say that Evolution is just a theory, like other theories, this is simply a false and uninformed statement.

Now, it is great to see Ben Stein and his crew catching employees and their boss by surprise at the Discovery Institute, where I.D. originated. But then the film NEVER properly explained to the audience the connection between the Institute and Intelligent Design, nor did it go into length about what I.D. is, what it hypothesizes, and the evidence and observation to which support it.

The connection that Stein drew between Darwin and ""social darwinism"" (e.g., Nazi eugenics) is absolutely appalling and absurd - such human atrocities and genocides have been happening for millennia (e.g., European colonialism prior to Darwin, the Chinese dynastic 'Spring and Autumn Period', etc...). Science is neither good or evil, it's how people choose to apply it that makes it so.

The bottom line:
I would recommend others to see it, NOT because this is a well thought-out and cogent film, which presented an interesting thesis filled with elegant arguments, but that, ironically, this is an uninformed and sloppy work that slanders!

But most importantly of all, as Galileo once said: ""In question of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.""

Yet those who blindly hold Darwin as their Savior, cling now to ideas 150 years old ! Darwin did not build a stairway to the truths of Evolution, but only a first step. His theories are valid, but woefully incomplete.

It is well past the proper time to put Darwin in his place: as a Pioneer. Each year that passes poses new questions, new incongruities, new problems with strict Darwinism. A fresh approach will bring us closer to the answer.

1)  You set up ID as a strawman who is the sole victim in this debate. The hate mail, court cases, and job losses go both ways.  A woman here in TX recently lost her job on the TX board of Ed for an E-mail that merely informed teachers on a forum on Evolution vs. ID, suggesting evolution as the more reasoned and rational theory.
2)  You make Evolution out to be the Bogeyman in this story. Evolution is a slippery slope toward atheism?  Come on??? There are many dedicated Christians, many scientists, who wholeheartedly believe in the basic tenets of evolution. Check out Mike Dowd's book and internet site: [...] . As a Christian, I believe Truth to be a dialectic progression. It's not either/or but both/and. I realize this is not a Fundamentalist position and that's OK because I left that Milk-toast Christianity for a more meaty variety a long time ago. Also, check out Panentheism and Process Theology.
3)  There were very little, if any, scientific facts put forth in the movie.
4)  You demonize Darwin as if he were in league w/ the Devil. In actuality Darwin came from a deeply religious family and struggled with his theory and its consequences throughout his life.
5)  Last but definitely not least, your equating all things Darwin and Evolutionary with Eugenics and Nazism/Communism is very bad science, and very bad logic.",1230595200,11,1512,4.748091603053435

Over all, a great but very simple movie; it is excellent as an introduction to those who have not been exposed to these ideas before, but critical thinkers will want more.

3501959,5,B001BYLFFS,"Politics, religion and science may be topics to avoid at parties, but they make an engrossing, if slightly heavy Ben Stein movie. Contrary to some naysayers, this movie is not anti-science, or even against evolution.  But it shows that several very different ideas all go under the same label of ""Evolution"".
  Since most people are theists and also are open to theories of evolution, we could say that ""theistic evolution"" is a common belief today.  But EXPELLED demonstrates that a powerful minority among scientists believe that Darwin's theory of evolution (there are other evolutionary theories) absolutely rules out the existence of God. Stein allows these men to speak for themselves here, and it's not always a pretty sight. Prof. Dawkins believes that God is impossible, but space aliens starting life on earth is ""an intriguing theory"".  (Where is your scientific evidence for space aliens, prof?)  Other leading apologists for Darwinism come across as lacking social skills, or even lacking compassion for their fellow human beings!
  But what really hammers home Stein's point is the Darwinian connection to Nazism, social eugenics and even Marxism.  ""Let the weak die, they are contaminating our gene pool!"" Do you realize at least a few of your college professors actually believe that? Scary, to say the least.
  EXPELLED should be shown to church youth groups, science classes at any grade level, adult study groups etc.  It's sure to provoke discussion!  For more reading on the ongoing debate, explore the books of Drs. Behe and Dembski, among others. Also recommended: Simon Conway-Morris (life forms develop in very non-random ways), Richard Milton (Shattering the Myths of Darwinism), Wolfram's ""A New Kind of Science"" (animal bodies are based on mathematical formulas, not natural selection), and Dr. Lee Spetner. All of these men believe in evolution of some kind, but NOT according to Darwin's antiquated model.

3501962,2,B001BYLFFS,"I finally got to see Expelled.
Found it quite moving to my surprise. Its pretty far off of course, but as a craft I enjoyed it.
Expected much worse.

First off I want to say what screams needs to be said to you Intelligent Design supporters:
Believe what you want. You are free to believe that we live in a giant teapot if you like. You are free to believe that Noahs Ark existed and we all are sons of Noah and his zoo-ship. Its just that as long as you can't find any evidence for it, thats more than inside your imaginiation and part of your religious faith, then science can't test it. Its impossible.

Scientific American editor John Rennie said this about Intelligent Design.
""a notion which firmly states that at one or more unspecified times in the past, an unidentified designer who might or might not be God somehow created whole organisms, or maybe just cells, or maybe just certain parts of cells--they're still deciding and will get back to you on that.""

The other problem is that questioning Darwin's theories in these days is just extremely sad. I know you want to believe your Bible and Quran so much.. but the evidence for evolution is mindbogglingly and breathtakingly enormous. And in reality lots of religious people believe in evolution, even if Ben Stein tries to hide them with this film. Look up Ken Miller. Look up Robert Winston. Heck, even the Pope has accepted evolution.

Ben Stein and the Expelled squad does something really dirty with this movie. They interviews only the Intelligent Design defenders in this movie, versus. a lot of atheist scientists who defends in evolution. That's the main problem of this movie. It tries to present a fictional harsh battle between religion and evolution. Thats propaganda! They could have interviewed some religious people who believes in evolution too, as that there is lots and that would would be interesting, but that wouldn't suit Ben Stein's attempt to alienate the viewer from evolution.

Instead we see Stein walking inside Darwins museum, with cold eerie music and dark pictures, staring a statue of Charles Darwin cold in the eyes, like he's looking for a sign of humanity in there.

Another problem is that we're not presented to what intelligent design IS. No explanation. Which is of course because it isn't a coherent theory. I bet if you asked all those various people Ben interviewed, you'd get very different answers. Even more strangely is however that they never define evolution either. Its strange, because its like Steins argument isn't that evolution is wrong, faulty, have scientific problems...

Its more that evolution is EVIL. It kills faith and it leads to bad things... which presents the craziest point of the movie: Evolution leads to Nazism. Which is just insane. It doesn't even deserve a comment.

But I'll try to explain it because I understand that for some Christians they can't tell apart Socialdarwinism and Darwism. Thats actually very sad. Charles Darwin had NOTHING to do with socialdarwinism.
Just because natural selection seems to be the rule of the nature, where there is no moderating structures doesn't mean humans who can build a society any way we want have to apply natural selection into our way of living. Thats just sick minds. Hate socialdarwinism, but it has nothing to do with Darwin.

And besides, socialdarwinism wasn't even the whole deal with Nazism. It was more complex than that. It was racial theories, it was strange religious stuff going on... and it was a cult of brainwashing and propaganda that took things too far and couldn't stop. It was a lot. Blaming Darwin for Hitler is as insane as blaming Newton for the Two Towers falling down, just because he discovered the theory of gravity.

But as a positive note. The reason I give this 2 stars and not 1 is rather perhaps a bit of a sarcastic one, but still I'm sincere. I think this is excellent propaganda.
Even I, who knew almost every detail about the movie before I saw it, and knew a lot about the subject to logically refute the movie to bits.. was still moved by it somehow. Emotionally I was caught in it. And that impressed me. If I didn't know any better I'd probably be in favor of this movie as a serious documentary.

Perhaps its because it kind of gave the illusion that evolution was destroying people's faith. It was destroying God. And it did present evolution as something rather awful. But this is of course all propaganda. Its a big seducing lie. Religious fundamentalists all over the globe has a new handy powertool now for brainwashing.

This might even be filmhistorical propaganda, ready to be remembered as a school example of how manipulating the filmmedium can be to distort truth and promote lies, for all eternity.
Congratulations Ben Stein. You made history.",1230076800,13,4781,4.802919708029197
3501963,1,B001BYLFFS,"What a load of trash.  The movie's main focus is trying to relate Darwin to Hitler - it Godwins itself right from the get go.  To believe in the veracity of any of its scientific claims requires a near-total ignorance of modern microbiology, astronomy, and physics.  Even the average person with an undergraduate degree, even one not science-related should be able to refute the scientific claims in this movie.  It is childlike in its attempt to reconstruct biological principles, although it does precious little examination of actual science.  Instead, most of the film dedicates itself to taking science out of context, making false allegations about teachers being fired for their belief, and generally propagandizing creationism and lying about its critics and their beliefs.

It's rare for the world's top film critics (The New York Times, Roger Ebert, the New York Daily News, Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, Newsday, Chicago Reader, Entertainment Weekly, New York Post, Village Voice, Time Magazine, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, USA Today, Newark Star-Ledger, the list goes on and on) to universally despise a film, but this one did it with its outlandish manipulations of fact, contempt for reason and truth, and willingness to, in a documentary, tell bald-faced lies about science, scientists, and the central claims of the film, bias in science education.

This movie has no redeeming qualities at all.  If it were a person you would lock it away in prison.  If it were a textbook you would keep it out of the classroom.  It has nothing of value to offer, period.",1230076800,15,1573,5.085603112840467

Our older children understood at different levels - even I will need to watch it several times to fully comprehend everything presented.  The end is shocking, and absolutely amazing.  Everyone should know what the evolution theory elite truly believe, as they admit on camera in this film.",1229990400,7,603,5.229166666666667
3501965,2,B001BYLFFS,"I am really disappointed that some Christians see a need for a movie like this. The movie reflects an unfortunate attitude of suspicion that many Christians seem to have toward science. It is insulting to Christians who are involved in science. And there are many, aside from the meager selection shown in the movie. With only one exception I noticed, all the Darwinists they showed were atheists. The exception was John Polkinghorn, whose interviews were presented so that his evolutionary views were hidden. Very misleading as to his true position. I'm sure he would be insulted at the finished version of this movie. I notice they didn't interview Ken Miller or Francis Collins, or even Mike Behe of their own discovery institute who accepts common ancestry.

Throughout the movie acceptance of Darwinian evolution as a theory is confused with a philosophy of naturalism. A philosophy of naturalism is the belief that there is no reality other than the physical reality we can sense. Not even the possibility of a God. However a methodology of naturalism, the exclusion of super-natural explanations, is the tool of science, and simply how we all deal with the world. Even the most devoutly religious engage in the kind of intellectual maneuver that Ben Stein characterizes as organized atheism when used by science. Any of us who gets in their car to find it won't start will raise the hood to see what's wrong, or if you're not mechanically inclined call AAA. We Christians might even say a little prayer. But most people will not blame demons. Many Christians, myself included, will see a divine purpose in it, as in all things, but most will not call on supernatural intervention on God's part. We've all seen natural explanations turn up too many times before. Christians believe, and the Bible teaches, that God uses natural forces to accomplish his will.

Super-natural explanations cannot be considered by science. They cannot be tested by physical means and all must be given equal validity on that basis. Super-natural claims can be evaluated but not by scientists. Evaluation of Super-natural claims is in the realm of philosophy and religion. History has shown that natural explanations are often found for phenomena that had been regarded as super-natural.

The scientific establishment is portrayed in the movie as suppressing freedom of inquiry and taking sides on a debate over intelligent design within the scientific community. But there is no debate over intelligent design within the scientific community. It is universally regarded as un-scientific. The only way Intelligent Design could be scientific is if the designer were natural. Advocates of ID rightly point to the fields of archeology and extra-terrestrial research as examples of attempts by mainstream science to detect design. But the designer in each case is a part of nature. Even if scientific evidence points conclusively to design, proposing any super-natural designer is no more acceptable than simply saying ""God did it"". When scientists like Richard Dawkins say that the findings of science support atheism they are 1) not engaging in science and 2) wrong (my opinion and not based on science). ID proponents make the mistake of attacking Dawkins' science instead of his philosophy.

I believe unquestionably in intelligent design. But that belief is based on faith and has little to do with science. As such my belief in ID is unshakable. Belief in ID that is based, or even substantially supported, by science is dangerous for a number of reasons. First it reflects a weakness or insufficiency of faith. We shouldn't need a ""sign"" to believe in God. Also, it is subject to the ever-changing tide of opinion in science, a very weak foundation for belief. And any scientific proof that shows the existence of God must be believed by all who are able to follow the proof. Would God force us to believe by allowing us to find proof of his existence?

Finally, the movie gives a tragic example of why belief in ID should be based on faith and not vice versa. Near the end, Will Provine gives his testimony as to how he became an atheist. Ben Stein says that his story is typical of the atheistic supporters of Darwinism that he talked to, and we can probably believe Ben on this. Will relates how his belief in design was gradually eroded as he learned in college how the design he thought he saw in nature was explained by natural causes. This discovery destroyed his faith, because his faith was never based on anything solid. His faith was based on belief in ID. And when that crumbled so did his faith. How many kids getting ready for college have faith that is based on ID, or some doctrine, or some particular interpretation of the Bible?

I'm giving two stars because I see the quality in the production. And it is very convincing and effective. I have friends who liked this movie a lot.

3501966,3,B001BYLFFS,"Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations of this movie. Maybe it was just intended to show that if you don't agree with other or exercise independent thought, that you can be shunned. If this is all the move was intended on accomplishing, then it succeeded.

I was expecting a lot more meat. It dabbled in subjects like probability (or better, impossibility) of dna auto-sequencing and failed experiments to create a protein molecule. I wanted a lot more science - things to ask evolutionists, like:
- what did the first life-form feed on?
- if the first life form died, how/when did the second emerge?
- why does a guppy want to spawn with another guppy and not a goldfish?
- why do mammals get erections? why are they attracted to one another? how did the reproductive system come about?
- how do animals alter their dna? i.e. how do they create defense mechanisms? how do they rationalize that they need a defense mechanism and imprint a design for that mechanism in their dna so that their offspring will have that mechanism?

There are just SOOO many questions to ask evolutionists, but this movie is not about that. This movie doesn't even allow you to have a logical debate about evolution. For that, I would recommend the book ""I don't have enough faith to be an atheist"".

One of the problems with the movie is that it belittles evolutionists with the cartoons and movie clips. I personally find evolution to be a joke, but the approach taken in the movie reduces its credibility.",1229904000,4,1487,4.689655172413793

This documentary doesn't so much advocate that intelligent design is the 'answer' to the origins of life, but it does attempt to allow for the teaching of an academic theory that resolves the apparent conflict between science and religion.

From the negative reviews of the mainstream media I expected ""Expelled"" to be amateurish and bible-thumping, but it is actually quite modest in its ambitions. If anything, it's worth watching simply to be introduced to Prof. David Berlinski, a real intellectual loose-cannon that will endear himself to anyone who has a suspicion of the university system and its academic pretensions.",1229817600,6,774,5.441666666666666

By the end of the film, however, this is completely shown to be false as it is God that becomes the focus of the discussion.  The final interview with Richard Dawkins, for example, is for the most part just Stein asking if Dawkins believes in various gods (Do you believe in the Hebrew god?  The Trinity, the New Testament god?  The Hindu gods? And so on and so forth).  As Dawkins says during the interview, these questions are ridiculous considering the fact that Dawkins is probably the most high profile and vocal atheists in the world, and throughout the interview he repeatedly stated he believed in no god, that he found the idea that a god might exist to be highly unlikely.

But all of that skirts the issue... why would a documentary supposedly about science make its climax a stupid and pointless conversation about whether or not a single person believes in God or not?

Instead, the film documented the attempts by the proponents of the theory of evolution to suppress the views of those who advocate alternate views of the origin of the species, particularly ID.

The actions and methods of the suppressors, such as Richard Dawkins, speak volumes about their lack of confidence in the the theory of evolution. Their motives for attacking the views of others are anything but academic or scientific, and provide a glimpse into just how politicized academia and science have become in the modern world.

Stein's film is not a convincing argument in favor of either theory, and the viewer will have to look elsewhere for a definitive treatment of the arguments in support of both theories. But, Stein does provide a convincing argument that the arguments of today's scientists about the origin of the species can not be trusted.

""Expelled"" makes it clear that one must carefully study the arguments for both theories, as well as the motives hidden between the lines of the arguments, to develop a personal working theory of the origin of the species.

3501988,1,B001BYLFFS,"There is not enough room to write all of my comments.  The longer the review the less likely that someone will actually read it.  So I will try to be brief.  I honestly wanted to see the film I thought this was supposed to be, detailed examples of academics being blacklisted for ""bucking"" the system.  What we get is a handful of examples with few details, no rebuttal of their situations, and then Ben switches focus and instead interviews ID supporters.  And even more confusing Ben constantly attacks atheists, but contends that ID is supposedly not religious.  He then switches to a man who argues that Darwinism led to Hitler and equates Planned Parenthood with eugenics.  All the while the splicing in stock footage of nazis, communists, and actual vintage propaganda.  To put the icing on the cake he cherry picks and mis-quotes Darwin, to prove the link that Darwin was actually a calling for some type of stronger master race.  Upon further study, the rest of the Darwin quote can be found quite easily and if read in context says NOTHING of the sort.

To call this movie manipulative and intellectually dishonest would be an understatement.  Even the anti-defamation league has slammed Stein for his attempt to connect Darwinism with the Nazis.  The Jews were killed in Europe for many reasons, eugenics was just the one of the many excuses.  Some of the reasons Jews were exterminated include blaming Jews for the collapse of the German economy, theft of Jewish property for the war machine, general wide spread anti-semitism, Hitler's personal hatred of Jews, and simple racism.  Anyone can hijack a philosophy and twist it for their own devious purposes just as the bible was used to defend slavery.  And to lump Planned Parenthood in with nazis is utterly disgusting.  Planned parenthood offers free STD education, low cost birth control, affordable and easily accessible pelvic exams, not to mention their support of rape and incest victims.  To somehow make Planned Parenthood a devious organization is reprehensible.

And my biggest complaint, not once does Ben Stein or anyone actually present EVIDENCE OF INTELLIGENT DESIGN in the entire film.  Why not explain ID if you are producing a film about the very subject?  If you want to see a good rebuttal of this entire film, Scientific American has an excellent point by point review, INCLUDING the actual picked through and dishonest Darwin quote that Stein uses in the film.  eXpelled is such theater that even the first and last scene where Ben is speaking before a crowd seemingly on a speaking tour was actually staged with extras!

I bought the movie so I could watch it again and share it with people I know. Unlike movies that are made by Michael Moore and Bill Maher, this movie showed intelligence. Learned people were interviewed. Questions were asked and answered. The movie did this in a very funny way. Yes, Ben Stein brought his point of view across, but it was done in a very intelligent manner. This movie should be watched only if you have an open mind and are open to new ideas and points of view.

Ben Stein questions places of higher learning as to why they are so closed minded to intelligent design or just the thought of intelligent design. A number of different people are interviewed and allowed to give their opinions or reasons for liking or not liking intelligent design.

Ben also shows the bigotry faced by people who only mention intelligent design. Points of how Darwinism is flawed are touched on and how it has been misused through modern times. People have lost tenure, jobs and respect from others over intelligent design. To me, this is a well done movie.",1229126400,6,1165,4.490566037735849

It highlights the differences between belief in intelligent design, as opposed to a traditional deity; and follows some wonderful philosophical paths when comparing 'design' against creationism - and one of creationisms (extremely abhorrent, & thankfully historic) sequiturs - eugenics.

(There, I said it.)  It was extremely funny (and sad) to see a scientist, a presumably intelligent person, essentially argue that it was more plausible that a smarter race of outer space aliens probably started life, and everything as we know it, than to concede that there may be a...God.

For the atheists and evolutionists, don't see it.  It will make you mad and you will race to Amazon and give it a 1 star rating (like the 100+ people already have).  Let's face it, there is nothing that can be said or done to convince you there is a God--a higher power--that could have made all things.  Therefore, to see bias in a scientific community that refuses to consider ID doesn't make sense to you: teaching ID would be like teaching a known falsehood.  As for your arguments and your beloved expelledexposed.com, I'll get to that in a moment.

To the agnostic, I think you should see it.  I am really interested in your opinion.  Mind you, Expelled in slanted (like MANY documentaries) to highlight the close-minded opinion of the scientific community in teaching how things came into existence.  It is either, 'Evolution or the highway, baby.'  If you are open minded, you might see how, in a PC world, God is never really given a chance.

Now, back to the evolutionists.  I'll address one typical excuse used by evolutionists, then move to expelledexposed.com.

Before I begin, I must say that I searched for an ID definition on the internet, and if what I found is correct, then I have misunderstood ID for a long time, but that's another discussion and not what we are here to discuss.

The most typical evolution argument against creationism/ID is that it cannot be put through scientific study to prove/disprove, therefore it cannot be possible or taught as science.  The theory of evolution is that we all came from a common ancestor.  JC! I had no idea that science has found the common ancestor, or re-created it in a lab.  Get that common ancestor out in the open and end this discussion once and for all.  I'm being serious, if you have the common ancestor, I want to know more.  And if you have the common ancestor, I would love to read the scientific re-creation of evolution from the common ancestor to cro-magnons, neanderthals, humans, monkeys, apes, chimps, gigantopithicuses, and (now) hobbits.

As for expelledexposed.com, the website seems to prove Expelled's claim.  I read the Evolution link and the Robert Mark's link.

First, the website is maintained by a Scientific Center for Education.

Second, As for evolution vs. ID, the website openly admits that, ""...scientists no longer feel any need to debate whether evolution took place; what they are doing now is working out the details.""  Thus, the scientific community's shun of religion is already established.

Third, I randomly chose one of the shunned (Robert Marks) to see how expelledexposed.com debunked the idea that wrong was done to him because he believed in ID.  On that website, they admit his site was shut down by Baylor.  They continue to admit it was shut down because they feared a connection between Baylor and ID.  In fact, everything Expelled claimed was TRUE.  Their only defense was that Marks could keep his website, but it couldn't be on Baylor's webserver.  ""Where is the harm?""  Gee, for a University priding itself on the open discussion of ideas and thoughts, that reaction seems very close-minded.

Look, I don't care what you believe, just don't sit there and squash other thoughts on the beginning of life, and turn around and say you don't.",1228867200,6,3798,4.820710973724884

Could it be that many people such as Dawkins have been put off with the hypocrisy of the world empire of false religion with it's extortion, bloodshed, ignorance & power gluttons, and that's what has driven them to a search for something a little more intelligible? In effect, these religious hypocrites have prejudiced millions against God with their concoctions of a sadist God who'll burn you forever if your bad, or kidnap your loved ones because he needs another ""angel"".... along with other unreasonable unbelievable nonsense that they have invented.

That's what this film is about: freedom. It's not about the argument over who or what created the universe; it's about the freedom to bring up the topic and/or discuss it.

That fact that freedom has been taken away in this area has veteran actor Ben Stein, the narrator and star of this documentary, hopping mad. For conservatives, this extreme intolerance in academia is not a revelation; it's been known for decades, but this documentary should open eyes for those unaware.

Stein and others in this movie illustrate that today's intolerance shown by academia and by scientists is so pervasive that it can be compared to the fascism of Hitler. The beliefs of the Left, disregard for human life and their elimination of freedom are discussed in this film. Even worse, as we see in this film, if you even mention the words ""intelligent design,"" you are toast in the academic or scientific community. Stein interviews people are a testimony to that; people who were dismissed from teaching for just utterly (without preaching) those horrible two words.

Along with examples, we see how Darwinism is tied in with a lack of respect for life. The last segment of this documentary is a tour of some of those horrific places in Germany in which people were exterminated, not just for racial reasons but because they were physically or mentally challenged. They weren't fit for breeding and thus, according to the twisted beliefs of Hitler and his mentor, Charles Darwin - as pointed out in this film - were murdered. Academia - no surprise - reveres Darwin. Stein ties all of these things together.

All of this is alarming but it's preaching to the choir because few people on the Left will look at this film and those that do, will not be tolerant to any of it's facts and opinions. As Stein informs us, we just hope this country doesn't totally give in to the PC Police, today's version of the Gestapo. His analogy to that in here is real and he calls folks to stand up for freedom to express one's opinions.

For atheists, this movie will be annoying at times but at least they get a number of opinions from their side, including the most famous non-believer, Richard Dawkins.

For those with open mind, this film is highly recommended. Stein, with his dry sense of humor, takes a troubling, important subject and prevents it from being too grim, although this is serious stuff, and he knows it, which is why he did the movie.",1228435200,8,2630,4.669546436285097

3502052,5,B001BYLFFS,"I know emotions are high as the topics of evolution / natural selection, intelligent design, and religious faith surround this film.  However, as I viewed it for myself, I think most of this heated discussion is misplaced.  This film just happens to be about these topics, but the real point Ben Stein is exploring is the problem that arises when a particular view becomes orthodox and uses its dominance to squelch any contrary view.

At no point in this film are the arguments for or against evolution or intelligent design made or compared.  While Ben talks with some folks who have been ostracized and punished for broaching the topic of intelligent design in science courses, the film never makes the case that their arguments are right and evolution is wrong.

The film merely points out that individual cells are astoundingly complex, even the simplest of them and the odds of one of them popping into being and surviving and having the ability to reproduce and those descendents successfully reproducing is vanishingly small.  In fact, in his interview with Dawkins, Ben brings up the Francis Crick notion called Panspermia, which is that life on Earth might well have been seeded here by some higher intelligence.  Now, the nave among us might point to this higher intelligence as God, but these scientists insist that such beings must exist and have evolved within our universal system.  Of course, there is no such requirement except in the minds of those defining this game.  What about an intelligence that popped in from another universe or other dimensions or other times?  Anyway, it is interesting to see these vaunted minds struggling with the realities and limitations of their elegant models.

Ben kept asking how life began and no one could answer.  He asked how the Universe began and no one could really answer.  And of course they can't, because by definition they are quite unknowable.  They are prior to our existing system and will require evidence not available here.

Personally, I was impressed that one of the scientists who heatedly pointed out that he had no more time to debate intelligent design because it bored him insisted that anyone who understood science properly would realize that there is and can be no free will.  This is, of course, a doctrinal, definitional, and faith filled view.  It has been debated for centuries and millennia long before our current scientific method was ever invented.  What you see in such a claim is testimony and if you reject that I will point to the word certitude rather than certainty for such a strongly held view of something that cannot be absolutely demonstrated.  Yes, I am aware of the debate on both sides.

Some have objected strongly to Ben visiting the Nazi extermination centers or using the Soviet system and the Berlin Wall as metaphors for the current scientific establishment.  The point of the film is that ideas have consequences.  While the Progressive fascination with eugenics and race improvement is no longer discussed, it is real and should be honestly and fairly discussed.  The Nazis made this a closed topic, but before The Final Solution, many were talking about purifying the races.  In 1904, H.G. Wells said, ""I believe .. It is in the sterilisation of failure, and not in the selection of successes for breeding, that the possibility of an improvement of the human stock lies."" He was not alone.

Or what about this from Wells in ""A Modern Utopia"":
""State breeding of the population was a
reasonable proposal for Plato to make, in view of the biological
knowledge of his time and the purely tentative nature of his
metaphysics; but from anyone in the days after Darwin, it is
preposterous. ... The State is justified in saying, before you may add
children to the community for the community to educate and in part
to support, you must be above a certain minimum of personal
efficiency, and this you must show by holding a position of solvency
and independence in the world; you must be above a certain age, and
a certain minimum of physical development, and free of any
transmissible disease. You must not be a criminal unless you have
expiated your offence. Failing these simple qualifications, if you
and some person conspire and add to the population of the State, we
will, for the sake of humanity, take over the innocent victim of
your passions, but we shall insist that you are under a debt to the
State of a peculiarly urgent sort, and one you will certainly pay,
even if it is necessary to use restraint to get the payment out of
you: it is a debt that has in the last resort your liberty as a
security, and, moreover, if this thing happens a second time, or if
it is disease or imbecility you have multiplied, we will take an
absolutely effectual guarantee that neither you nor your partner
offend again in this matter.""

Doesn't that take your breath away?

If freedom means allowing really annoying people to do what they want (because we all annoy each other in various ways), surely academic freedom includes the right to be wrong.  A great many of the facts now taught as true will be overthrown and every modern technology will eventually be made obsolete.  People of faith should not be automatically excluded from the academy.  If that is the true aim of people like Dawkins (and one of the scientists in the film openly stated his desires to eliminate all faith in God) then we can identify such people as a threat to human freedom and their agenda undeserving of the subsidies of the tax dollars of believers.  These people would then be advocating the establishment of their faith using government power and money. This is forbidden in the American system and should be rejected by free people everywhere.

So, view this film and keep an open mind.  Decide for yourself.  See what is actually being said rather than what is being claimed on its behalf.  Nothing I saw in the film advocated that faith in God should end scientific investigation. If someone thinks that, they are horribly off base. However, I did notice people who believe that faith in God disqualifies someone from being a scientist.  This last notion is not only egregiously wrong, it is dangerous.  Maybe you will see different things in the film than I did.  Just remember:

Ideas do matter and they do have consequences.

3502053,5,B001BYLFFS,"I was impressed at the breadth of the perspective on the issue of whether Intelligent Design Theory actually is scientific theory.  This documentary uses direct interviews with esteemed academicians, relatively unknown professionals, and some political activists involved in the issues around Intelligent Design.  It is shown that whereas Evolution Theory was once roundly opposed by the large majority of society, Evolution Theory has become almost axiomatic among contemporary scientific/politic cross-sections of society.  The first portion of this documentary, which comprises about 80% of the play-time, is a secular investigation of what actually is behind the various positions on Intelligent Design.

The last portion of this documentary involves application of theology to secular ethics: if Evolution Theory is taken to extremes then what might be the overall social/political results?",1228176000,4,895,5.96875

Like how intelligent design is only an acceptable idea if it is by space aliens, not God. And how they hate religion and want to get rid of it.  A few of them admit that they don't know how life started but that candor never comes out of academia or the moneyed science institutions. They keep serving us organic soup. Also what I liked about it, was that it shows the connection between social Darwinism and atheism and genocides like the holocaust.  I've watched a lot of Nazi movies and documentaries but I don't recall ever seeing this connection made clear. Not by major media. Most supposedly educated people seem to think Hitler, Stalin and all their ilk were just crazy evil monosters that just happened to come along and get in power at around the same time. You don't often see them presented as normal people who faithfully and ardently believed in ideas that were wrong. ""Expelled"" traces the evolution of those ideas and shows that they are still around and in power. I admire the makers of this film and hate to see them take such a thrashing from the establishment and on the internet.  Although largely ignored by the mainstream media Expelled is at least as good as Michael Moore's latest efforts.

In the movie, Richard Dawkins and one other gentleman whose name I do not recall are perfect examples of how non-sensical evolutionists sound.  Dawkins explains that highly ""evolved"" men created (designed) life.  Dawkins advocated design, demonstrating his problem isn't with Intelligent Design itself but with God.

The other gentleman, when asked by Stein how life began, rambled about some ridiculous theory of how life began ""on the backs of crystals.""  Huh?  When Stein asked the evolutionist how life went from ""mud"" to man, the evolutionist rolled his eyes as if Stein was just not getting it.  ""I already told you,"" he bemused.  ""But I'll try again.""  He then repeated his ""crystal"" theory, which was really not an answer at all.

3502078,5,B001BYLFFS,"The great debate between intelligent design and evolution.  What shocks me is that I have seen this myself at university of Arkansas many years ago. The same biasness the same bullying.  It is amazing.  I have been wondering if it has been getting any better, in the field of education on the narrow mindedness of it all, I guess not.  Since breakthroughs in technology, like in the past 10 to 15 years, there has been more evidence leaning towards the intelligent design theory than the evolutionary theory.  This is the first DVD I have seen that covers this issue well.  It is highly discussed in the intellectual field but not highly read by the masses.  This summarizes what I have read lately. I highly recommend reading more on the intelligent design theory.  There are some mind-blowing facts that have been uncovered recently.  If you can find computerized representations on some of these finds in science, it would just shock you.  Nature, biological structures, etc are just so highly complex. With the evidence, I just believe it had to be designed by intelligent beings.  Anyone with a half a brain would conclude that also. This is just one more leap for the Renovator historians and writers.  These people write the truth that disintegrates the norm of Marxist and darwinists propaganda instilled in our education institutions and mass media outlets.

One beef I have is that I understand the evolutionist's connection with Nazism. However, B. Stein makes no real mention of the close connection with the communists; it is only implied.  It must be remembered that the Communists have murdered several million more civilians than the Nazis and have justified it in their minds too.  This was to due to their understanding of Humankind's place in the worldview of the communist's utopian state of mind.  Remember Marxists (and communists) are one of two types of people: atheists or God-haters.  That is it.

Check out the last part of Stein vs. Dawkins.  Dawkins Would believe in the I.D. theory ... if it were assumed an alien started life on this earth.  But he would not believe in the I.D. theory if it were assumed that a Deity started life on earth.  Check Out Ben Steins ""LOOK"" he gives him after his statement.

Ben starts by investigating why certain professors and scientists are being censored in the nation's educational institutions because they don't believe Darwinian evolution is airtight.

Irony follows as Ben finds that the people who are doing the persecuting are as religiously-motivated as those they claim are hurting science because of their views.

Dear Mr. Ben Stein,
  There was, is, and ever shall be an Intelligent Design, by God!
  We ordered your DVD, Expelled, because you are funny and the commercial clip was funny; however, the story is not funny.  We agree with your premise.  I found the facts scary, but my husband thought the DVD was boring (hence, the 1-star rating).
  A daughter's family likes you, wanted to see something funny, and they also agree with your ideas; so they wanted to borrow it when we were finished. After describing Expelled somewhat, I suggested she have her husband preview it before the rest of the family (ages 9-21 yrs.)saw it; because of the real and scary pictures of Hitler and the Holocaust.  The 21-year-old girl is a junior at Olivet Nazarene University in  Bourbannais, Illinois, majoring in communications.  Since she would certainly appreciate the content, I told her she could take it back to college and share it with her professors.
  As you can see, we liked it, but we didn't like it.  Thank you for  your work, your mind, your contributions, and your DVD.  Let Freedom Ring! God's peace be with you.
  God is the Intelligent Designer-Creator, by Jove!
Sincerely,
Alan and Prudence Harnish

Ben Stein does a great job intervewing evolutionists and creationists in his classic deadpan style. Lots of compelling arguments and facts to show the fallacies in Darwinism. For example, an analogy they give is that when Darwin came out with  ""On the Origin of Species"" in the 19th century,the human knowledge of the cell was so basic and limited, that if it was comparable to a mud hut then today it is comparable to a Saturn 5 rocket.

3502105,5,B001BYLFFS,"I like Ben Stein, and the trailer for the movie looked funny.  Then I read the reviews on Amazon and from different movie critics and thought, ""if so many people hate this movie with such unholy passion, it must be worth seeing.""

I am an academic.  Having said that, my professional colleagues in many cases do not come out of this movie looking like more than highly-educated stooges, repeating the mind-numbing litany of ""Darwinism is all we need.  Darwin explained God.  We need no god.  All we need is what science has given us and continues to give us.  All hail Science.""

As someone that works in the social sciences, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.  This was highly interesting, very entertaining, and frankly, frightening.  There is no doubt that the sort of blinkered, philistine, pig-ignorance highlighted in this movie is fairly common in the scientific community.  What is disturbing, however, is not just the way in which the social Darwinists are so determined to uphold a standard (Darwinism) that is obviously flawed even to many of them.  The truly horrifying aspect of this film was the jihadist approach taken by those same scientists in relation to Intelligent Design: ""IT IS HERESY.  IT MUST BE STAMPED OUT.  DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE ID PEOPLE.  THEY ARE EVIL.  THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOUR LIVES WITH GOD AND RELIGION AND.....""

3502106,2,B001BYLFFS,"...even if they don't know anything about science.  You see, in America, we have the freedom to talk, loudly, about subjects we don't understand.  One's lack of knowledge shouldn't prevent one from challenging the status quo--it's about FREEDOM, you see, and all you liberal over-educated elitist thought-police who don't understand that should stop hating America and find God.  And no, I'm not saying the intelligent designer is necessarily God, praise his name.  It could be anything, but not space aliens, because that would just be too silly.  I don't even know why I brought up intelligent design, because that's not what Expelled is about, despite the movie's title and content.  It's really about evolution, and how, because it kills Jews, it can't be true, and if it's not true, intelligent design must be true, not that the movie's about intelligent design of course.  But it's not really about evolution, what the movie is about, well it's really about two things:  1) the RIGHT to possess a loud and proud lack of knowledge and 2) the RIGHT to challenge prevailing beliefs with new ideas, even if those beliefs are backed up by painstakingly collected multitudes of evidence across multiple fields of study by thousands of people over decades, and your idea, well, isn't--because nothing beats ""facts"" and ""evidence"" like that feeling of absolute certainty that you are right.

I know, that wasn't really a ""review"", so, unlike most of the five-star ""reviewers"" who have been posting here lately, I've written an actual review:

A-hem.

Game-show host turned eye-drop peddler Ben Stein tries his hand as warrior for intellectual justice in ""Expelled:  No Intelligence Allowed"", a film which is supposed to show how ""smart new ideas"" are systematically repressed by ""Big Science"" but ends up documenting the massive scope of the filmmakers' dishonesty:  From the staged introduction to lying to the interviewees to copyright violations to deceptive editing to simply making stuff up, there appears to be no tactic short of physical violence that the filmmakers feel justified in using to support their thesis.  Perhaps even more importantly, the film shows once and for all how annoying Ben Stein really is.  Stein's nasal, mush-mouth drone would serve as an excellent soporific if it weren't so smugly irritating.  His artless delivery turns an awkward attempt at creating a ""rebel fighting for academic freedom"" persona into an embarrassing failure.  This would still be true if his script contained facts.  Stein, who was hilarious during his twelve second portrayal of a mind-numbingly boring high-school teacher in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", in Expelled is merely mind-numbing.  The liberal (no offense to the moviemakers, of course) use of images Michael Moore would find too literal and manipulative is at least as distracting as Stein's bumbling diction.  I'm guessing that these distractions were intentional, so as to draw attention away from the film's shameless disregard of facts and logic.

The makers of Expelled claim not to be concerned with any particular ""smart new idea"", so it is confusing why the film focuses on intelligent design, mainly in the form of that classic creationist technique:  raising objections to evolution (and they wonder why we compare intelligent design to creationism).

Expelled is bound to exasperate, bore to tears, or reduce to hysterics anyone who expects logical, evidence-based arguments in a film calling itself a ""documentary"", although people who watch reality television should find the film compelling.

Overall, two stars:  One because Amazon says I have to and one because Expelled serves as an excellent example of the tactics used by people who think the rest of us are too stupid to recognize that intelligent design has less to do with science and more to do with religion than its proponents will admit.",1227139200,10,3878,5.196141479099678

And I would add that the issue isn't really if you believe in ID or not, the issue is while seaching for answers that no one has does it make sense to exclude a theory just because you disagree with it?

This is a movie about how our institutions of higher learning have packed faculties with people from the left - - most of whom accept liberal dogma (like the total and complete acceptance of Darwin's theory to the exclusion of all other notions) and are quite intolerant to consider alternative thought.  One would think this to be the antithesis of what higher learning is about - but Stein proves it otherwise.  Not endorsing Intelligent Design (ID), but using it as an example, Stein points out how alternative thought has been suppressed in colleges and universities in America.  And not just suppressed.  He talks to many who have been penalized for their views in the form of denied tenure, censorship and loss of employment.  Stein does this in frightening clarity through interviews with those who espouse ID as well as Darwin's theory of Evolution.

This is a documentary that I highly recommend to people - - your favorite liberal friends as an example - - who worry about Church and State issues which look elimentary when compared to the threat of the ""only one view allowed"" that has infiltrated our institutions of higher learning.

3502127,5,B001BYLFFS,"I just watched this movie, and it was great.  I thought it was well paced, and well made.  I liked the interview segments a lot.  Those interviewed may try to hide behind excuses and say they were tricked, but I think that the answers were not contrived, and were blatantly honest.  This is something that we need more of.  I think one of the main points of the interviews was to show that in the same way that evolutionists say that ID has problems, that evolution also has the same kind of problems.  (In other words, both sides seem to have these problems, so why can't there be free speech and a sharing of the podium so to speak).  Evolution doesn't have all the answers, ID doesn't have all the answer, if they get together, maybe they will find that YEC is the answer...  (I wish...hehe)

Kidding aside, some of the penetrating questions that Ben Stein asked during interviews showed that evolution did not have all the answers, and when it didn't have answers, it didn't have evidence either.  This is the same complaint made towards ID.  So once again, the shutting out of ID from the science community and academia is just a conspiracy, since both sides have their share of problems.  Ben Stein's main call at the end of the movie is freedom of speech, because that is what America is all about.

As for those who the movie said were fired from their jobs, didn't get tenure even though they should have, etc. I believe that the truth lies somewhere between this movie's version, and the version found at [...].  I do not believe that either one has the monopoly on truth, though I would go more with the movie then the website.  (I tend to root for the underdog.)  If these stories are true, then it is a real travesty in the scientific and academic world.  Makes one want to see science and academia as the Catholic Church of old...

Overall, I thought it was a well done movie.  I do not believe that they overdid the section on Nazi Germany.  I did not go into the movie thinking one way or another, and this section, even with it's final word did not offend me.  The point of the section seemed more to show what happened in the past due to beliefs in darwinism, and links to eugenics.  In the same way that the Church has to accept it's blood stained past, Science and evolution need to accept the fact that beliefs in evolution taken to the extreme may have resulted in the actions of Nazi Germany.  The question is, what to do now?  (I say knock down the walls and go for free speech.  I think such debate would liven up things in the halls of academia.

I thought Ben would argue some (or his) position about creationism/intelligent design vs. Darwinism/evolution, wich was dealt with and explained by various sources and people in the film. However, what shocked me most, was the fact that so many scholars and ""thinkers"" of the creationism/intelligent design theory were ostracized, expelled from their jobs and outcast because of their personal views on how ""we got here.""
This makes me think, once more, that we are still very biased and don't really live in a ""democratic"" country, when we are not respected by our views and beliefs on something, and free to express those thoughts and what we think is right.
But the bottom line is that I loved the film, give Ben a lot of credit for doing such an extensive research and presenting so many individuals with so many varied and interesting points of view and ideas on a very controversial issue. It didn't change my mind on my own thoughts but gave me a broader idea on the issue and a passion to defend free thinking and minds.",1226793600,12,1170,4.797029702970297

3502134,5,B001BYLFFS,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this; as such, let me share my thoughts. It was surprisingly informative and challenging.

It is important to note this documentary is more about freedom of speech than it is the theory of intelligent design. Yes, it covers evolution vs. ID and even creationism (Please note the latter two are NOT the same!), but the crux of Stein's point is not which is right or even valid, but simply whether or not both sides are equally heard. His thesis clearly proves they are not. He goes on to suggest a lack of open dialog, a lack of free speech directly leads to the loss of other freedoms and in quick fashion. A portion of the video explores the Darwinian theories as the Third Reich's basis for ethnic cleansing and genetic selection, which also led to eugenics in America.

The bonus features on the DVD include deleted scenes (quite fascinating) and action steps for those who want to learn more or support Ben Stein's campaign toward equal freedoms of speech.

This movie enlightened me to the potential repercussions of a situation I knew existed, but the severity of which I did not fully grasp. It's well-done, witty and challenging. I recommend it for thinkers, those who support intelligence and discovery.

3502138,4,B001BYLFFS,"It should be noted that this movie is designed to be a work of propaganda.  It is not, and was never intended to be, a balanced look at the arguments between evolution and ID.  It is cut from the same cloth as Bill Maher's ""Religulous"".  Both feature a public figure with his mind already made up looking for validation.

That said, I'm far from being a conservative Christian and I think it's an important film.  Not a great film, but well put together.  Perhaps its greatest flaw is that it did not go far enough to separate Christian propaganda from the notion that some force beyond pure randomness has played a role in the development of life.  The film hints at it, but Stein himself seems attached to attributing ID to a ""god"".  It is not necessarily a god.  It has nothing to do with a religion.

In the end, I think the ultimate answer will reveal that it doesn't matter whether there is a god.  I have worked with people who were told they didn't understand science and were kicked out of academia, then went on to create ground breaking innovations that defied basic ""laws"" of science.  I think we need to stop being awed by people who have committed their lives to accumulating letters behind their name through institutional indoctrination and start, perhaps, seeking truth within.

I'm pretty sure that we will someday realize that both evolution and some intelligent force are simultaneously at work, making the notion of survival-of-the-fittest suspect on a fundamental level.  It's pretty obvious to any aware observer capable of that level of sensory.  To close exploration of these life experiences off from inquiry is a disservice to mankind, and that is really the greatest value of Stein's film.",1226361600,8,1717,4.772881355932204

One would think that after 2,000 years of persecution of people who have made scientific observations of nature that the 21st century would be free from their attempts to replace science with religion. Religious extremist may not be burning scientists at the stake anymore but in today's world they have found other ways to destroy those who do not succumb to their religious beliefs. Religions already have their classrooms for presenting their views. Its called church. This movie is a prime example of how some religions with a kindergarten level understanding of evolution have tried to debunk the teaching of evolution in schools. Evolution is a scientific fact not a theory. Variations in how evolution occurred are theories and I.D. does not meet the rigors of scientific investigation.

I viewed it only for informational purposes as I don't know much about intelligent design and wanted to learn. Due to my religious beliefs, I was sympathetic to it as a theory, and my only complaint about the documentary is that Stein didn't spend more time defining it precisely. Particularly fascinating was the segment on DNA. I recall that one reviewer stated that the film refused to interview experts whose opinions clashed with ID, but that is not true.

3502143,4,B001BYLFFS,"We should break down the wall of censorship, intimidation, and retaliation that keeps intelligent design theory out of the academy. America has honored and must honor free speech if it is to remain America. That is the message of ""Expelled,"" a controversial new film featuring Ben Stein. That message is communicated through interviews with Darwinists and Intelligent Design (ID) theorists as well as through various scenes, both humorous and somber. A reoccurring theme is that of the Berlin Wall keeping out Western ideas of freedom and keeping its prisoners locked into a dead and deadening ideology--Communism.

Being a bookish soul, I seldom attend films--perhaps two per year at most. Thus, I am not conversant with contemporary cinematic values or customs. (The previews nearly killed me. I keep my eyes shut, but my ears had to hear and bear a monstrous assortment of crashing, thumping, exploding sounds from hell. One preview was of a Batman movie I would not wish on my worst enemy. Amazingly, some ignoramus brought a baby into this sonic inferno.) I found the film's extreme close ups, jump cuts, and rapid scene changes annoying. Often during an interview there would be a cut away to an old black and white scene to illustrate a point. This became cloying and detracted from the debate. I yearned for more cognitive content and fewer special effects. Nevertheless, some important realities--hidden by the mainstream media--come crashing through this significant documentary.

Those who have advocated ID or even allowed its ideas some voice in their classroom or in their journals have been excommunicated by the Darwinian priesthood. That language is strong, but utterly apt. A biology professor's teaching contract is not renewed after she mentions ID in her class. Another professor's web site is censored by Baylor (a Baptist school) because it advocated ID. The editor of a science journal is fired because he supervised the publication of an article by Stephen Meyer defending ID. Professor Guillermo Gonzalez, despite a stellar academic record as an astronomer (he discovered several new planets and wrote a textbook), was denied tenure because his book, The Privileged Planet, which argues that earth was designed. A journalist's career is threatened because she didn't use the typical ""boilerplate"" caricature of ID in a story. Several professors make comments under the protection of secrecy; they rightly fear Darwinist reprisals.

I will not give all the details of this egregious and draconian persecution here, but these stories are true and indicative of the sociology of knowledge at work. The Darwinists control the academy, the grant money, and most of the media. They set the plausibility structure: things taken for granted and things unthinkable. This, by the way, has little to do with actual epistemology: things rational and things irrational. The Darwinists are seldom open to honest give-and-take debate; instead, they typically reject ID as anti-scientific and ban it from public forums. I have observed this for years, and it is heartening to find a major-release motion picture telling this story. Good evidence needs the proper venue to be seen as such. The Darwinist fight like mad to make this impossible.

Neither the scientific case against Darwinism (yes, there is one) nor the scientific case for ID (yes, there is one) are adequately communicated in ""Expelled,"" although ID thinkers such as Paul Nelson, William Dembski, David Berlinski (a brilliant and delightful curmudgeon), Jon Wells, and, Stephen Meyer are given some (but not enough) time to explain it. It is remarkable how articulate Dembski, Meyer, Wells, and Nelson are and how much intellectual punch they deliver in just a matter of minutes. However, we never hear of ""irreducible complexity"" (Michael Behe's argument concerning the bacterial flagellum and other devices) or ""specified complexity"" (the indicator of design presented by Dembski). One computer-generated scene shows the complexity of the cell, but little is explained. (For the best DVD available arguing for ID, and against the criticisms of it, see ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life."") Dembski and Nelson briefly comment that one can believe in aspects of evolution and still support ID, since the key claim of ID is that aspects of nature require design to be explained. This does not rule out considerable development after the design has been introduced by an intelligent cause. However, this point needed more emphasis. One hopes that those moved by the film will consult the works of these authors, as well as the ground-breaking writing of Michael Behe, the most important practicing scientist of the ID movement, who, strangely, did not appear in the film.

""Expelled"" also explores the philosophical and social implications of Darwinism, arguing that social Darwinism flows from biological Darwinism. Contra The New York Time's sneering and unserious review, social and biological Darwinism are of a piece. If the material world is all that is (or can be known), then there is no objective morality or moral law that exist outside of it that can be wrong to bear on it to correct it or direct it. (Yes, there are theistic Darwinists, but the film largely explores Darwinism as a naturalistic worldview. This is, in fact, how it is taught in the vast majority of public institutions today.) If so, the struggle to survive is all that matters; it is all that one is left with. Darwinian biologist William Provine makes this basic point in the film to introduce the section on Nazism, although he does not speak to social Darwinism or the Nazi's appropriation of Darwin. However, Provine denies objective good and evil, since biology is all that counts across the board. As Berkinski says in the film, Darwinism is a necessary condition for Nazism, but not a sufficient condition. That is, Nazism needed Darwinism for its ideology, but it needed other false considerations (of race and history) as well. However, Darwinism, in itself, does not provide any refutation to Hitlerian ideology, since (again) there is no knowable objective moral law outside of nature. The stronger must prevail--period.

The number of interviews and their brevity obscured some important differences between those within the Darwinian camp and between those who oppose Darwinism. It was briefly pointed out that Dawkins disagreed with Darwinists (represented by Eugenie Scott) who say that religion and Darwinism are compatible. He claimed that Darwinism explains religion away and leads toward atheism. Although the line was not used in the film, he is famous for saying that Darwinism allows one to be ""an intellectually fulfilled atheist."" My take is that if Darwinism is true--the entire biosphere can be explained on the basis of undirected, natural causes (or by chance and necessity)--then theism is much less likely to be true. This is because biology is denuded of any evidence for a designer, when, in fact, Christianity (and other forms of theism) claim that evidence for God can be found precisely there (see Psalm 19:1-4; Romans 1:18-21).

While Alister McGrath was interviewed making comments against Dawkins's atheism, it was not mentioned McGrath does not support intelligent design. In fact, he endorses methodological naturalism and is a theistic evolutionist. This is the chief reason why the debate between Dawkins and McGrath did not go well for McGrath. He could not argue from nature itself for a designer, thus ceding tremendous too much ground--the entire universe!--to Dawkins. Professor John Lennox (a brilliant and charming man I met in Hungry last summer, who holds three earned doctorates), who also appears in this film, did a far better job of handling Dawkins in a debate. The reason was that he deftly employed ID arguments against atheism.

Near the end of the film physicist John Polkinghorne said something out of sync the ID perspective by claiming that science has one view of the world and religion another; and we need to put them together. What that means, essentially (from what I know of the man's work), is that science explains the empirical and religion explains the spiritual. But ID claims that nature itself, when properly interpreted, shows signs of a designing intelligence. Evidence for intelligent causation in nature lends some intellectual and empirical support to theism, although it by no means gives us all the details of a religion. Polkinghorne and McGrath hold to a kind of ""two domains"" approach to science and religion. Science and religion cannot be at war because they speak of two different things. The leading ID thinkers, on the other hand, hold to more of an ""interactive approach""--science and religion both make truth claims about reality that need to be assessed according to the best canons of evidence. On this, see J.P. Moreland, Scaling the Secular City, chapter seven.

A few comments are in order about Ben Stein's interview style. I know little about this man, except that he has been both an academic and in movies. Strange combination, that. He took a rather droll approach, and the interviews are highly edited and too short. His interview with Dawkins wastes time by asking him if he disbelieves in all gods (""the Jewish God, the Hindu gods...?"") and trying to pin him down as to what the exact percentage is that there is no God. This got laughs when I saw the film, but was intellectually pointless. Dawkins gets the best of him. Stein, however, did help reveal the absurdity of Michael Ruse's idea that life began by riding on the back of crystals by simply repeating the bizarre idea several times in an incredulous tone of voice. Without a designer, the unliving, unthinking, unplanning universe must become enormously creative and lucky beyond belief.

While the major news outlets are viciously attacking ""Expelled"" as creationist propaganda (and they didn't have to actually see it to say that), the fact is that the film reveals a systematic, unfair, and deeply un-American suppression and distortion of ID thought in the academy. (For example, Eugenie Scott claims that ID thinkers have produced no peer review work. This is flatly false. Just go to [...] to find a list of peer-review work.) The Darwinian inquisitors make Joseph McCarthy look like a girl scout. In fact, there were Communists deeply embedded in the academy and the motion picture industry (something young Ronald Reagan fought against) during the Senator's day, and Communists were genuinely dangerous to the American experiment. McCarthy was not entirely wrong, although he has become a whipping boy of the sound-bite crowd. ID thinkers, however, are no threat to science or to any American ideal. Yet they are a threat to Darwinism, which has become a largely unchallengeable orthodoxy in America.

Strangely, it never cleanly defines ID, or separates it with any clarity from creation science.  It *never* offers any reason to take it seriously as science.  It, very importantly, never explains what separates science from other areas of human inquiry.  It therefore dodges all of the important questions that it raises.

The film is very thorough and shows multiple scientists, including professors from several prestigious universities pointing to the fact that the cell and other biological concepts are simply too complex to have been randomly developed by chance (its sort of like believing your computer suddenly built itself--let's get real).

I watched Ben Stein's film last night, and from the onset it is overtly obvious that, as an ID proponent, he does have an agenda. But after all is said and done, if those in the Creationist camp are indeed a bunch of imbecilic, propaganda-spewing, anti-science establishment crazies, then let us settle this the good ol' American way. Let us create a free and fair forum for a lively and equitable debate. (And I do mean more that just posting opinions for reviews.) And to up the ante, let us take the debate to the classrooms of our great USA so that the facts - or lack thereof - may fight for themselves.

If Ben is as IDiotic as half the reviews (um, comments) purport, then what does the Scientific community have to lose. Seriously! In fact it will just buttress their anti-God establishment. Won't it?

The ID movement is intellectually sloppy and that is why they aren't allowed in, they don't want to go through the normal process, they haven't even tried.

3502193,5,B001BYLFFS,"Paradigm shifts have never been popular, especially when involving any type of religious implication (just read some of the other reviews). This documentary makes a strong scientific case in support of intelligent design. The inherent problem, of course, is that intelligent design inevitably leads to a designer, i.e., ""God"", which leads many who refuse to allow God into the science lab to be predisposed to reject any evidence to the contrary. (This is interesting in light of those who say they would believe in God if He would just give them ""proof""? If He did, would His proof be submissible? And maybe He has, and it isn't?) And certainly, while some of the arguments given in this film may be considered biased, what is to be said of the arguments in favor of darwinian evolution? The fact is that there are multiple sound, scientific arguments this film presents in favor of intelligent design that are totally ignored and swept under the proverbial rug by darwinian scientists and philosophers (more often than not, the former are often the latter, also), not to mention critics (just read the reviews - much criticism, little ""proof""; heavy marginalization with lack of significant scientific rebuttal). I am personally partial to options and free choice. I am pleased that someone has finally broken through the ""intelligent design"" checkpoint and presented ""the other side."" At least intelligent people can now weigh things out for themselves instead of being force-fed darwinian evolution. Is there another option for the scientific mind? Yes, there is, and it is presented in this film. Regardless your current position on origins, the information shared in this documentary will make you more intelligent and better informed in darwinism and intelligent design.",1225584000,9,1777,5.195121951219512
3502214,5,B001BYLFFS,"First of all, to set myself apart from the average one-star reviewer who never even watched the film, I not only watched the film, I watched it twice AND I own it.  What a shame that so many ""reviewers"" choose to reveal their ignorance and bigotry rather than actually reviewing the film and its claims.

Documentary films, until recently, were what you were forced to watch in High School when no substitute could be found for ""business"" (euphemism for remedial) math.  That all changed with Michael Moore and his ""Roger and me"".  Moore made other documentaries, won some awards, turned into a raving liberal lunatic (thus qualifying for awards), and made some big bucks, thus rejuvenating the genre.  Much as Rush Limbaugh defines talk radio, Michael Moore is the poster-child for modern documentaries.

This documentary, by actor, intellectual and comedian Ben Stein, concerns the persecution of gifted, intelligent scientists who dared to even consider the possibility of Intelligent Design, the term used for saying that something other than randomness resulted in the universe we inhabit.

The film follows the persecution and mistreatment of several scientists who are victims of a witch-hunt by a scientific establishment whose current goal is not the advancement of knowledge, but rather the maintenance of a dogma held with such virulence and nastiness that it rivals the Inquisition.  Scientist after scientist loses job, prominence or tenure, not because they are incompetent, but because they dare to question an atheist world view.  None of them doubt genetics, molecular biology, or natural selection - none of them state the earth was created in 6 days (a belief held by some which is usually referred to as ""creationism""), they simply wonder and study if the data aren't better explained by a Creator or creative force of some kind.  That's it.  And isn't that what scientists are supposed to do?  Isn't that what Darwin himself did?

One of the main problems with this debate is that the terms used are often mis-interpreted (often purposely) by the opposing side.  For example, as previously alluded to, Creationism is not Intelligent Design.  Creationism or Creation Science is a theory that the earth was built by a creator in a very short time, some using times as short as the 6 ""days"" of the Bible.  There are institutes, journals, and professional scientists who hold this theory - more than you would think.  One of the assignments I had in my senior Zoology-major class in evolution was to pick a subject ( I chose vestigial structures like our coccyx, appendix or third eyelid remnant), and then compare the standard literature to the creationist apologetic literature.  (And there is a surprising amount out there.)  It was no big deal.  (I think the evidence fits with an old earth (billions of years), but I see no reason to ridicule or insult those who think the data doesn't necessarily show that.)  And that, in my opinion, is how Science should work - free inquiry by free minds that are free to follow the data anywhere and come to their own conclusions and then try to support their conclusions with logic and experimental or observational evidence.

As a scientist, I can sadly tell you that it just ain't so.  This documntary, in a dispassionate and reasoned way, demonstrates this.  Stein interviews both sides and you can't help but cringe at the weasely atheists who lie and obfuscate to hide their religious bigotry.

Intelligent Design simply posits that there are findings better explained by a creator than random mutation.  Stein notes that the atheists continually lie and say that all the Intelligent Design people can say is that evolution can't yet explain certain things (an argument often called 'irreducible complexity' - that is that some features of life like eyes or cilia are so complex and require so many simiultaneous things to occur that natural selection alone cannot explain them).  And while this is indeed one of the arguments against standard atheistic evolution, it is by no means the only argument.  So the reviewers here that claim that the film uses this argument, are simply showing that they not only didn't see the film (which specifically notes that this is not their only argument), but shows an utter lack of familiarity with the subject since they don't even bother to note other objections.  As a matter of fact, this film doesn't even get into the pro and con arguments - it simply shows that reasonable, intelligent people with reasonable intelligent questions that even have evidentiary reasons for their opininions are mericlessly hounded and persecuted by radical Nazi thought police who patrol the academic streets.  I urge you to read several of the one-star comments and how many complain and refute the pro intelligence design arguments that aren't even part of this film.  Then you will also know they didn't even see the film.

The problem with terminology also goes the other way.  You will note i use the terms atheistic evolution.  There are many believers in evolution in various permutations who are not atheists.  But the atheists like Dawkins are the controlling interests in the field, so I am simply trying to specify who is involved in the issue rather than implying that all believers in evolution are atheists (unlike the majority of the critics of this film who are forever using false definitions and making unwarranted accusations.)  Evolution can mean anything from adaptation to atheism.  Stein's interviews show that many big guns use evolution as a catch word to describe their world view of atheism, immorality, and as they themselves state, lack of ""free will"".

This is, of course, utterly ridiculous and without foundation.  Plenty of people accept both evolution and a Creator.  (God could simply have used evolution in his creation, for one thing)  But there is a large segment, and a controlling segment, of Science that has jumped to these ridiculous metaphysical beliefs.  I know, because I too have experienced them.

Darwin also wrote other books beside Origin of Species.  In one he says, ""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.""

This sentiment was the basis for what was called by Darwin's cousin ""eugenics"" which morphed into the racial superiority of Hitler.  The movie then shows the fruits of eugenics.  Stein notes that National Socialism (the formal title of Fascism and thus a left-wing variant, not a right-wing one - the mis-naming of this type of socialism into a false right-wing movement is one of the triumphs of the Left) is not the end-all of all eugenicists - in spite of what the idiots who gave this extraordinary film one star say.  Throughout this movie Stein is careful to not overstate or misconstrue the opposition - one of the reasons I gave this careful but powerful movie 5 stars.

The movie ends with further interviews with Dakwkins (author of the God Delusion) and others who resort to name-calling of the lowest sort to describe those who don't accept their world of amorality and meaninglessness.

The 2 most powerful parts were the ""hospital"" where the socialists murdered the handicapped and the simple interview with a Polish scientist who simply points out how there is almost no intellectual freedom in America.  And being part of this scientific establishment for so many years, I can only hang my head in shame and admit that Stein is 100% right.

You can't help but compare this documentary to those from Michael Moore.  This film has better production values, allows the opponents to express their views, has no profanity, and doesn't ram its viewpoint down your throat like L'enfant terrible Michael Moore, so this film is much better.

This review should have really been quite short, simply explaining what the film was about and commenting on its presentation, but the insane reviewers who gave this one star without seeing the movie or understanding it (assuming their drug-addled, brain-washed cerebral cortices are still capable of any reasoning higher than exclaiming, ""Pass the doobie, vote for Obama, and turn on the porn"") required this more detailed review in the hopes that you will actually watch this film with a somewhat open mind.

And one last comment on whether evolution is settled fact or not - a common problem with evolution was noting that evolution proposed gradual change via mutation and fitness, but the fossil record showed no such thing.  So, believing in evolution and wondering how to explain this discrepancy, Eldredge and Gould in 1973 came up with a theory called ""punctuated equilibrium"", meaning that evolution sometimes works really slow and then it works really, really fast and then it stops again.  We have no idea why or how, but there it is.

3502222,2,B001BYLFFS,"After months of interest, I finally got around to watching this documentary. Purporting to investigate the persecution of freedom in the American scientific academy, the documentary represents the worst its genre.

I found this film to be a clumsy and manipulative exploration of an interesting topic.

Stein prowls the alleyways of academia without distinguishing between instructor ranks and tenure-track ranks. Several of his prominent subjects apparently have credentials, but the viewer is not provided with details. This represents the worst problem with Stein's approach: the lack of context. Large numbers of qualified academics are denied tenure every year, and to assert without question that each of these cases is political demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the tenure process itself.

And in at least one of the cases, the instructor was not on tenure track, making the argument about the connection between academic freedom and her release from the university blurry at best.

Stein also points to eugenics as a cause of the Nazi Holocaust (spending no effort to discuss other variables that contributed, such as Hitler's experiences in WWI, the economic forces in modern Europe, the influence of Nietzche on modernity or even Hitler's own religious faith). Stein equates eugenics as a natural outcome of ""Darwinism,"" instead of the narrow movement that it was within the academy. The result is the unsubstantiated claim that ""Darwinism"" directly justifies the Holocaust and will create another such movement in America today if unchecked.

I was more amused than offended at the expulsion scene from the Smithsonian. Does any viewer really think that ANY uninvited camera crew WON'T be tossed out of the Smithsonian? They sell prints and videos of their cultural artifacts as a major source of revenue.

And then there's Stein's ambush of Richard Dawkins. Having read Dawkins' recent book, ""The God Delusion,"" it is clear to me that Dawkins' views (which I ultimately disagree with personally) are not represented by Stein's interview. Watching Dawkins struggle to make sense of Stein's questions is painful, it does look as if he thought the conversation was geared for another treatment (which supports his widely circulated claims that Stein lied both about the title and the intent of the film when he arranged the interview).

All said, it was never clear whether Stein possesses the needed credentials, background or gravitas to make him a good focal point for this needed discussion. Much context about the rancor surrounding these debates is missing, leading the viewer to take on faith that there exists a terrible and arbitrary bias within the academy.

Perhaps Stein should limit his cultural authority to his gifts of comedy and financial insight (though did he not also miss the recent crisis on Wall Street? I don't remember any warnings from him to his viewers and readers).",1225238400,13,2911,5.272138228941684

If this is a free country then why does tyranny dictate our education?  If we are to be well-informed people, we should know what we are talking about when we make our arguments.

3502236,1,B001BYLFFS,"This documentary had created controversy before it was even released. Most of it was based on the fact that rumours abounded that many prominent scientists had been duped into starring in a documentary about evolution that was really about ID. Their suspicions where correct when it emerged that indeed creationists had pulled another fast one over these people (and the viewer) in order to get ID back into the public realm. This seems like an odd time to attempt something like this. It was barely a few years ago that the major proponents of ID ended up testifying at the Dover trial only to admit, after swearing on the bible, that Darwinian evolution was responsible for much of the biology they proposed was outside of Darwinian explanation. Moreover the trial discovered that the ID movement was actively involved into deceiving people that it had nothing to do with creationism. Some swift detective work uncovered that much of the ID literature was simply creationist material with the words creationism struck out and replaced with ID. Let me put it in a much for generous way than Judge John E. Jones III (appointed in 2002 by George W. Bush) did. ID proponents are misleading deceptive fraudsters who want to create a false dichotomy that it is either evolution or god, not both. If you don't believe me just read the trial summery from John E. Jones III (who was threatened with murder if he didn't support ID) or watch the theist `Ken Miller on intelligent design' on YouTube to learn about his testimony against ID and why it is bad.

Expelled doesn't present the case for ID. Nowhere in its running time is the viewer informed as to what ID really is about or why it is an issue. So Ben Stein presents a show on a topic that isn't even discussed. Why not discuss it? Why not mention one single ID hypothesis? The answer is simple. All ID arguments have been unambiguously and unequivocally shattered by... science. So instead of ID arguments we get, stories about ID proponents who tried to argue ID and didn't succeed, intercut every 30 seconds with Nazi footage (meant to represent evolutionists). Yes every 30 seconds! It really is like that. Mention evolution, show a Nazi. Mention ID, show someone sitting on a bench like your uncle sobbing about how science isn't fair and make sure only to tell 1% of their story.

For example, Richard Sternberg, a biologist, was also a peer-reviewer who included an article by Stephen C. Meyer (Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture) in a peer-reviewed journal. Sternberg was not `expelled' (he actually resigned). What Expelled doesn't tell you is that Sternberg is the only person that the public knows who reviewed that controversial paper (a paper which can be demonstrated as inaccurate). To this day we do not know what other associates of his reviewed the paper and some of his associates with better qualifications to review that paper where not informed about it. In this instance the peer-review process appears to be just one person, Sternberg. Subsequent investigations found that Sternberg is not impartial but an ID advocate.
Guillermo Gonzalez is an astrophysicist not a biologist and an advocate of ID. He claims he didn't get tenure because he advocates ID. Yet non-ID scientists have been rejected for tenure in the same faculty.
Caroline Crocker, a biologist, taught that Nazisism was based on Darwinism. She was not hired again (her contract was up) and subsequently became the executive director of the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center.
Robert Marks is an engineering professor, not a biologist. He launched a web site at Baylor University promoting ID. The university didn't want to be affiliated with ID and shut it down. They did allow him to host the site with them but in a private unaffiliated capacity.
Michael Egnor a neurosurgeon has claimed that evolution is not essential to practicing medicine. That claim has been criticized by doctors who use evolution science while practicing medicine (such as developing cures for viruses that evolve). I sometimes wonder if these people would walk their talk. Don't like evolutionary science developments in medicine? Don't take the medicines then. You don't have to be a genius to figure out how natural selection will treat them.

Apart from these there are also the claims that the film producers misled many of the interviewees. Michael Shermer claims that Ben Stein tried to lead him to give certain answers by asking the same question dozens of times (he does this to Dawkins at the end also). Shermer asked Stein to stop doing this and Stein continued until he got Shermer to say he didn't know about cases where scientists had been fired for statements on ID. The PZ Myers story is even more concerning because he was thrown out of attending the film premiere (anyone could get tickets online) by the producers who filmed him for this production. Myers was expelled.

Then we get the usual run of the mill fallacious statements. Demski claims that Darwinism has not improved since 1857. He really thinks that evolutionary biology is not an expanding science that has made new discoveries since Darwin. Dr. Wells claims that Darwin doesn't talk about variation within species (Darwin wrote two books prior to Origin about this topic and it is in all his other works also). Dr. Wells also thinks that `observed speciation' doesn't exist (Google observed speciation).

Stein quickly disconnects evolutionary biology from abiogenesis and goes for the easy target apparently thinking if he can convince himself that we cannot show evidence for abiogenesis then all the evidence for natural selection and evolution should be discarded. Instead we get a very shoddy presentation of astrobiology which excludes the `RNA world theory' and `chemical evolution'.

At no time does Stein present or address the question about what caused an `intelligent designer'. Read that one again if it didn't sink in the first time.

Expelled then makes the claim that cells cannot have evolved ignoring the endosymbiotic theory or that there are many types of cells. Stein includes the myth that there is no evidence for the increase of information in the genome. They then say that ID implies design while evolution implies undirected process. This is untrue. Natural selection also implies design. It is just that in this case the designer is not an individual but a natural trend that happens because of how particles interact within environments over long periods of time.

Expelled claims that ID can change our worldview but the truth is that ID has been the worldview for the last 1900 years + (hundreds of thousands maybe). Our worldview went through its most dramatic changes only in the past 300 years with scientific progress and peer-review!

Between the intercutting of Nazis you may hear about books that Hitler wrote and the makers try desperately to link him with Darwinism (no quotes available) and so bring up other authors who seem to think Hitler was a Darwinist but omit that Hitler wrote about young earth creationism, a divine plan and was a baptised Catholic plus the fact that at the Nuremberg trials guess what the Nazis used as their defence.... Darw...!! no... they used the church reformer Martin Luther and his anti-Semitic literature. Bending the story a little more they then pretend that eugenics and the idea of a utopia is a post-Darwinism idea but omit that it has been around since Plato, Aristotle and furthermore that religions have eugenics programs on who you can marry and not marry and how many you can marry... and how to treat your slaves. Let's not forget that eugenics in nature is why incest is taboo.

Neutral theory, Horizontal gene transfer and Transposons are new to the field of evolutionary biology. Neutral theory doesn't even incorporate traditional Darwinian natural selection and genetic drift is another stunning mechanism of evolution that is different from natural selection. ID proponents will never tell you about these though... but evolutionists will.

The biggest defect of Expelled is not to talk about its main subject, ID. It doesn't even challenge evolution. Instead it says teach the controversy. The controversy is their own controversy though and it is a battle that occurs even with religions. Accept evolution or accept ID. That is core false dichotomy they want to present. Believing in ID and believing in evolution are held at odds by many of these ID proponents but what they also don't tell you is that ID is splintered into its own factions. It isn't even unified enough to propose what it is... hence why ID is basically omitted from Expelled.

The one thing this documentary does show up is that there are some very prominent scientists and people who know jack about biology and yet are so-called leaders in the field. Stop the press. You could have their job tomorrow by spending a few years getting your science knowledge into better performance and it isn't that hard, especially when we have leading geneticists saying that the genome doesn't increase in information. Never before has a documentary made it so apparent that learning about biological evolution and science from the peer-review would probably guarantee you the lifestyle you thought you could never have. Thanks to Ben Stein et al ID believers only serve to make it easier for people who stick to hard science. Winning by being fitter somehow? That reminds of a certain process.... a process which Expelled failed to even explain properly.

Pros:
Makes you want to become a scientist who is guided by peer-review
Doesn't make you want to be an ID advocate.
Lots of job opportunities apparently.

Cons:
90 minutes of `Expelled'

*NOTE* Not one single positive reviewer can actually show...
a) What is wrong with evolution.
b) What positive factual claim ID makes.

Not one of them has shown any evidence for any of it.",1225065600,26,9929,4.972289156626506
3502237,2,B001BYLFFS,"That teacher from Ferris Beuler's Day Off? Sad, lugubrious music interwoven with dreary pictures of Nazi Germany and Charles Darwin? David Berlinski touted as a brilliant scientist?! It can only be one thing: Ben Stein's film Expelled.

You know the story. Stein starts off concerned about what he sees as a lack of academic freedom when it comes to sceince and discussion over the theory of evolution. Stein attempts to make a case for the idea (far cry from a theory by scientific definition) of intelligent design by traveling around and talking to those scientists (more of them are philosophers of historians of science) to discredit the theory of evolution, and give a boost to ID.

Like so many other films in this ""docutainment"" genre - Religiolous, any Michael Moore film - this film is a clever piece of rhetoric and not much more. It is filled with highly edited interviews, clever editing tricks (all the evolutionists are interviewed in very dim and dreary light, while ID folks are interviewed in well-lit happy settings, generally around nature), and out-and-out inaccuracies.

So, before I get into some of these, let me bring up why I give the film 2 stars. First, I do think the film was interesting in so far as it goes, and as long as one take it only as seriously as Michael Moore's concoctions. Stein talks to a lot of interesting folks and some fair points are made, generally about the strained relationship between science and religion.

Then there are the less-than-stellar moments, where anyone who understands the debate between science and creationism can see Stein's flaws with ease. Stein, for instance, harrangues Richard Dawkins and Michael Ruse about evoluiton's inabililty to explain the origin of life. (Anyone who is up on their science knows that evolution is about how species, not life, came about. The latter field is abiogenesis.)

Also, for a film that made a big deal out of convincing us that evoluitonists are atheists, it spent no time at all with those evolutionists (yes, they are numerous) who are theists. No interviews with Ken Miller, Francis Collins, Francisco Ayala, Michael Dowd, John Haught, Karl Giberson or anyone else. This was especially (and suspeciously) odd because of the film's very correct claim that several of the world's great scientists were religious. While Expelled touts this as proof that science and religion are not incompatible, it fails to mention any - NOT ONE - evolutionist who is religious (not Alfred Russell Wallace, Asa Grey, Theodosius Dobszhansky, or anyone).

To make matters worse, there are numerous factual errors in the film (beyond its claim that to be a good theory, evolution must have an explanation for the origin of the first life).

(1) The film makes much, for instance, of Richard Sternberg, who Stein says was fired after letting an intelligent design-favoring article into a journal. This is inaccurate on several counts. Sternberg wasn't fired (as his position as editor was voluntary, and he had turned in his resignation letter sixe months before the incident). The article was criticized not as much because it advocated ID, but because there were so many factual inaccuracies in it that the journal retracted it in embarassment.

(2) The film suggests that Darwinism leads to social darwinism, and takes a quote from Origin of Species COMPLETELY out of context. In it, Darwin is made to sound as if he is advocating artificial breeding in human populations. Actually, Darwin's intent behind the passage was the exact opposite: to highlight the fact that human societies do things that are more ""compassionate"" than the purely natural darwinian struggle, and that this was a good thing (not a bad one, as Stein wants us to believe). Nor does the film mention that for every scientist that championed selective breeding (and most were philosopehrs and ""social scientists""), there were scores who did not (like Darwin, his friend, Thomas Henry Huxley, and co-founder of evolutionary theory Alfred Ruseell Wallace. This omission is troubling seeing as it is so well known.
[...]

Overall, though, I do give this film two stars because even though it is dead nuts wrong in so many areas, it does provoke a few interesting thoughts on the relationship between science and religion. And every once in awhile, it is good for us lovers of science to remind ourselves that the opposition may not be correct, but they sure are clever.",1225065600,8,4432,5.002713704206242
3502238,1,B001BYLFFS,"This documentary had created controversy before it was even released. Most of it was based on the fact that rumours abounded that many prominent scientists had been duped into starring in a documentary about evolution that was really about ID. Their suspicions where correct when it emerged that indeed creationists had pulled another fast one over these people (and the viewer) in order to get ID back into the public realm. This seems like an odd time to attempt something like this. It was barely a few years ago that the major proponents of ID ended up testifying at the Dover trial only to admit, after swearing on the bible, that Darwinian evolution was responsible for much of the biology they proposed was outside of Darwinian explanation. Moreover the trial discovered that the ID movement was actively involved into deceiving people that it had nothing to do with creationism. Some swift detective work uncovered that much of the ID literature was simply creationist material with the words creationism struck out and replaced with ID. Let me put it in a much for generous way than Judge John E. Jones III (appointed in 2002 by George W. Bush) did. ID proponents are misleading deceptive fraudsters who want to create a false dichotomy that it is either evolution or god, not both. If you don't believe me just read the trial summery from John E. Jones III (who was threatened with murder if he didn't support ID) or watch the theist `Ken Miller on intelligent design' on YouTube to learn about his testimony against ID and why it is bad.

Expelled doesn't present the case for ID. Nowhere in its running time is the viewer informed as to what ID really is about or why it is an issue. So Ben Stein presents a show on a topic that isn't even discussed. Why not discuss it? Why not mention one single ID hypothesis? The answer is simple. All ID arguments have been unambiguously and unequivocally shattered by... science. So instead of ID arguments we get, stories about ID proponents who tried to argue ID and didn't succeed, intercut every 30 seconds with Nazi footage (meant to represent evolutionists). Yes every 30 seconds! It really is like that. Mention evolution, show a Nazi. Mention ID, show someone sitting on a bench like your uncle sobbing about how science isn't fair and make sure only to tell 1% of their story.

For example, Richard Sternberg, a biologist, was also a peer-reviewer who included an article by Stephen C. Meyer (Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture) in a peer-reviewed journal. Sternberg was not `expelled' (he actually resigned). What Expelled doesn't tell you is that Sternberg is the only person that the public knows who reviewed that controversial paper (a paper which can be demonstrated as inaccurate). To this day we do not know what other associates of his reviewed the paper and some of his associates with better qualifications to review that paper where not informed about it. In this instance the peer-review process appears to be just one person, Sternberg. Subsequent investigations found that Sternberg is not impartial but an ID advocate.
Guillermo Gonzalez is an astrophysicist not a biologist and an advocate of ID. He claims he didn't get tenure because he advocates ID. Yet non-ID scientists have been rejected for tenure in the same faculty.
Caroline Crocker, a biologist, taught that Nazisism was based on Darwinism. She was not hired again (her contract was up) and subsequently became the executive director of the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center.
Robert Marks is an engineering professor, not a biologist. He launched a web site at Baylor University promoting ID. The university didn't want to be affiliated with ID and shut it down. They did allow him to host the site with them but in a private unaffiliated capacity.
Michael Egnor a neurosurgeon has claimed that evolution is not essential to practicing medicine. That claim has been criticized by doctors who use evolution science while practicing medicine (such as developing cures for viruses that evolve). I sometimes wonder if these people would walk their talk. Don't like evolutionary science developments in medicine? Don't take the medicines then. You don't have to be a genius to figure out how natural selection will treat them.

Apart from these there are also the claims that the film producers misled many of the interviewees. Michael Shermer claims that Ben Stein tried to lead him to give certain answers by asking the same question dozens of times (he does this to Dawkins at the end also). Shermer asked Stein to stop doing this and Stein continued until he got Shermer to say he didn't know about cases where scientists had been fired for statements on ID. The PZ Myers story is even more concerning because he was thrown out of attending the film premiere (anyone could get tickets online) by the producers who filmed him for this production. Myers was expelled.

Then we get the usual run of the mill fallacious statements. Demski claims that Darwinism has not improved since 1857. He really thinks that evolutionary biology is not an expanding science that has made new discoveries since Darwin. Dr. Wells claims that Darwin doesn't talk about variation within species (Darwin wrote two books prior to Origin about this topic and it is in all his other works also). Dr. Wells also thinks that `observed speciation' doesn't exist (Google observed speciation).

Stein quickly disconnects evolutionary biology from abiogenesis and goes for the easy target apparently thinking if he can convince himself that we cannot show evidence for abiogenesis then all the evidence for natural selection and evolution should be discarded. Instead we get a very shoddy presentation of astrobiology which excludes the `RNA world theory' and `chemical evolution'.

At no time does Stein present or address the question about what caused an `intelligent designer'. Read that one again if it didn't sink in the first time.

Expelled then makes the claim that cells cannot have evolved ignoring the endosymbiotic theory or that there are many types of cells. Stein includes the myth that there is no evidence for the increase of information in the genome. They then say that ID implies design while evolution implies undirected process. This is untrue. Natural selection also implies design. It is just that in this case the designer is not an individual but a natural trend that happens because of how particles interact within environments over long periods of time.

Expelled claims that ID can change our worldview but the truth is that ID has been the worldview for the last 1900 years + (hundreds of thousands maybe). Our worldview went through its most dramatic changes only in the past 300 years with scientific progress and peer-review!

Between the intercutting of Nazis you may hear about books that Hitler wrote and the makers try desperately to link him with Darwinism (no quotes available) and so bring up other authors who seem to think Hitler was a Darwinist but omit that Hitler wrote about young earth creationism, a divine plan and was a baptised Catholic plus the fact that at the Nuremberg trials guess what the Nazis used as their defence....

Nov. 1, 2008 by Wm. YH. Scarle, 813-835-0129

Ben Stein's film ""EXPELLED"" has been released for sale on DVD, so I have finally been able to see it.  Joan and I watched it last  Sunday afternoon and it deserves wide exposure.

The documentary concerns the tyrannical conduct of academia in the matter of research and exposure of the theory of  ""intelligent design"" in biological science.  Stein interviews representative scientists who have been ridiculed, denied tenure, fired, blackballed and generally persecuted because they dared to make some positive motions toward the new research in intelligent design of biological entities, especially in the micro biological field.

Of course, the real issue is Darwinianism.  You will notice that I have used a word which indicates a philosophical rather than a scientific position, because this is where the conflict lies.  Darwinianism has become the religion of many in the biological sciences.  Most, but not all, who follow Darwin's lead are atheists.  The theory of natural selection is their creation myth.  Nothing may be allowed to threaten this paradigm.  Thus they have established a new form of the Inquisition, this time using scientific orthodoxy as the rule, and academic disgrace as the punishment for failure to follow it.

The interesting aspect of this debate is that the atheists who accuse the  ""intelligent design"" movement of being subversive  theologians rather than scientists use totally religious arguments to make their points.  The accusation is that  ""intelligent design"" is disguised religion, not science.  The way to make this point is to attack ID's science.  But, this is what the new village atheists can not do, because essentially their arguments have noting to do with science, but with anti-religion, or atheism.

The first  line argument of these Darwinists is that there is no proof for the existence of God.  Since biological science is empirically based, that is it deals with the observation of physical reality, why would anyone expect physical proof for God, who is a spiritual person.  And here is the common sense core of the matter.  People like Richard Dawkins, the Oxford scholar who is the dean of the atheists, knows nothing of theology and very little philosophy.  He is totally ignorant of the field in which he writes his book, ""THE GOD DELUSION.""

Dawkins is interviewed by Stein in the film, along with several other atheists.  Stein also interviews scholars who have been the victims of this latest form of the inquisition.  He also delves into the results of this kind of pseudo scientific tyranny as it effects culture, and is allowed to dominate society.  His segments on the Nazi regime and its ties with Darwinism are chilling.

The subject is important because of the affirmation of the Darwinists that there is a battle between science and religion.  No such battle exists.  Almost all the pioneers of modern science were Christians, and nothing has changed that essential relationship.  There is a battle between world views that has nothing  directly to do with science.  It is because the atheists deliberately confuse this issue that Stein's film is an important contribution to our understanding.  It should be seen by the younger generation especially, so that the lens through which they view the world will be unclouded by the propaganda of the new inquisition.

3502240,5,B001BYLFFS,"I found this documentary to be very informative and very fair in it's critique. The conclusions that were drawn were fair and very plausible. There is NO logical reason as to why Intelligent Design should/could not be taught side by side with evolution. The only reason I came away with for not doing it was because ID is considered ""ridiculous"" and would eventually point to the ""possibility"" that a greater power, God, could be responsible for all that we see, including ourselves. And this, given the fact that ID has as much, If not more, scientific evidence in it's support than evolution has in it's defense. I strongly suggest those of you who are more open minded than the current academic intelligentsia to view this documentary for yourselves and draw your own conclusions.",1225065600,17,783,4.894736842105263
3502241,5,B001BYLFFS,"This film is an important statement about the lack of academic liberty on college campuses.  It is scary. Ben Stein also investigates the political and philosophical corollaries of Darwinism, using history as an important piece of evidence.  He even visits Dachau, a point in the film where this lively journey takes a somber turn.

It is not actually a film about Intelligent Design per se; Stein gives you enough to whet your appetite and wonder what's so awful about it, then moves on.  If you want to learn more about ID, I would suggest Michael Behe's book, Darwin's Black Box, or a nicely made DVD entitled The Privileged Planet.",1225065600,18,635,4.798165137614679
3502242,4,B001BYLFFS,"The basic point of this movie, that science and academia have their approved lines of thought that they defend with religious fervor to their own detriment, is a very valid one and one that applies far and wide, not just to evolutionary biology. However, ""Expelled"" does not stay focused well enough to compellingly make its point.

The first third of the film contains too much travelogue footage. It does not matter where Ben Stein had to travel to find his interviewees. Shots of the Eiffel tower and ooh-ing over the oldest building in Paris are irrelevant. And while I can see what point Stein wanted to make with the extended concentration camp section in the last third, he doesn't clearly state the argument that led him there. Also, after presenting the idea that intelligent design is an alternate theory that inquiring minds should want to investigate, the Nazi comparisons turn his case into an attack on Darwinism, which is different that what Stein stated he was out to do. And after making the distinction that intelligent design is not necessarily tied to religion, he goes ahead and totally blurs that distinction.

I think that a good editor could turn this film into a compelling one-hour TV show. At its current length, it's more likely to hurt its cause than help it (which is probably why most of the reviews here come from people firmly entrenched in one side or the other who show no sign of considering the other point of view).

Then, after making that 1-hour TV show exposing the closed minds of science and academia, if Stein wanted to attack Darwinism directly he could just sit Richard Dawkins down and let him run his mouth while the camera rolls. Dawkins' deadly serious expounding (near the end of Expelled) of the idea that life on earth was intelligently designed by aliens is nothing but jaw-droppingly embarrassing for scientists everywhere.",1225065600,8,1878,4.8625
3502243,5,B001BYLFFS,"Must see video. The documentary brings out truths that the news media hides. Some reviewers contend that this movie is full of lies. Only reporters and journalists perform that function. In this movie, the interviewed scientists themselves speak there beliefs and opinions. Both sides are presented by experts in the field. Viewers will come away from this movie with a better understanding of the issues on the theory of evolution.",1224979200,23,432,5.185714285714286
3502254,5,B001BYLFFS,"The whole point of this excellent film is that an establishment of educators and scientists suppresses those who don't support their ""faith"" in the theory of Darwinian evolution. The position of the film's makers is that scientists and educators should be free to explore all avenues of research and inquiry: to follow evidence wherever it takes them.

There is no factual evidence for the origin of life as a result of random forces (even Richard Dawkins admits that during an interview in this film). What does he (Dawkins) suggest are better explanations for life than ID (Intelligent Design)? Aliens. Aliens may have created life on Earth. But THEY were created by blind random forces (again, while paraphrased, this is Dawkin's own words). Honestly, this is science? No. What it is is an atheistic world view that is falsely represented as science.

I am not arguing that creationism should be taught in schools. The people who made this film aren't saying that either. They're saying freedom is freedom as defined by the Constitution which means people shouldn't be punished because they postulate that life is so incredibly complicated, even at a cellular/molecular level, that it appears designed.

Atheists are entitled to their ""belief"" and believers in Diety are entitled to theirs. Science and faith are NOT incompatible. Science is the realm of HOW. Faith is the realm of WHY. They are complimentary.

I highly recommend this film.",1224979200,11,1444,5.1059322033898304
3502255,3,B001BYLFFS,"I like Ben Stein. He's a highly intelligent individual who even though was once a Presidential speechwriter for both Nixon and Ford and who first gained national prominence as an economist, was able to later go on to a successful career in film and television, winning several Emmys. About eight months ago I learned that Stein had made a documentary about intelligent design and people who have been ostracized from their academic jobs because of their promotion of the theory. I am not a proponent of intelligent design, but I am a proponent of academic freedom and believe that educational institutions are supposed to be places where critical questioning, analyzing, and debate are encouraged and not suppressed. I know from my own experiences as well as from other research that has been done, that this is not always the case and that sometimes educational institutions do the opposite of what they are supposed to do: instead of encouraging intellectual growth they actual discourage it and try to mold students into a certain way of thinking. Therefore, after learning about Stein's movie, EXPELLED, I was intrigued and decided to see it.

Basically, the film uses a series of interviews, documents, historical footage, and an animated video to illustrate that free speech and academic free thought aren't encouraged and supported in our educational institutions. That is the major thrust of the film. Unfortunately, the film goes about making its point in an unorthodox fashion by focusing on proponents of intelligent design who have been ostracized because of their beliefs and illustrating how the theories of Darwinism were a component of what led to the Holocaust. As one would imagine, this unorthodox juxtaposition has caused a massive controversy to surround the movie.

As far a movies go, EXPELLED is pretty much an average documentary. There is a story that is told, some of the interviews are very interesting, and the editing is excellent. There really isn't anything new that is said or done in the film, but it is tied together in a fresh and original package.

Some have compared the film to the movies of Michael Moore, but that's not quite the case. Moore is famous for taking clips, sound bites, and single words completely out of context and editing them so his subject say exactly what he wants them to say. Some of the interviewees in EXPELLED have claimed that the film is completely inaccurate because they were led to believe the movie they were being interviewed for was something different than what was actually made. Those claims are probably true, but it doesn't discount that the things the people said weren't taken out of context and weren't edited together to make people appear to say things they really didn't.

Ben Stein is his usual witty, irreverent self throughout most of the movie, but when the film makes its connection to the Holocaust he actually becomes emotional and the audience witnesses a side of Stein that has been rarely seen before. There are many who claim that the film's claim of an attack upon free speech and academic free thought has very little to do with the Holocaust and is exaggerated (just look at the 1 Star reviews at Amazon.com). That might be true. Still, there is a connection there. Nazi scientists weren't born overnight and their belief system, of which Social Darwinism was a part, led them to be able to commit the atrocities that they did.

Overall, EXPELLED is an average documentary about an attack on free speech and academic thought in our educational institutions, using the controversy of intelligent design and evolution as a backdrop. Opponents of intelligent design will probably hate the film and proponents of the movie will laud it. If you ignore both, you might actually learn something and understand the real meaning of the movie. Like I mentioned at the beginning, Ben Stein is a really smart guy and sometimes the smartest way to actually get people thinking is to stir up a little controversy.",1224979200,8,3997,4.950819672131147

Ben Stein, the highly recognizable television personality, actor and former White House presidential speech writer, is on a journey to answer one of the biggest questions ever asked: `Were we created, or are we the result of random chance - a mud puddle struck by lightning?' Stein, who is also a lawyer, an economist, an author and social commentator, is stunned by what he finds on his journey. He discovers an elitist scientific establishment that has traded in its skepticism for dogma. But even worse, Stein uncovers a long line of biologists, astronomers, chemists and philosophers who have had their reputations destroyed and their careers ruined by a scientific establishment that allows absolutely no dissent from Charles Darwin's theory of random mutation and natural selection.",1224979200,12,1059,5.266272189349112
3502257,5,B001BYLFFS,"One of the biggest faults for evolutionary theory, is to explain how the first single cell came into existance. The cell is now known to be so complex, that an accident cannot explain it's existance in a reasonable fashion. It takes a blind faith to believe in evolution. It would be similar to walking in the woods, finding a violin, and then trying to explain how a tree accidentally produced it.  This is not religion.  This is a line of reasoning.  This line of reasoning does not go away by saying it is stupid, or that the people who feel this way are stupid. Prove that it is stupid.
Ben Stein has shown in this documentary that evolutionists cannot disprove this line of reasoning.  In fact Ben Stein was even able to get Richard Dawkins to personaly express that Intelligent Design may be the answer as to how life began.  See this documentary.
This movie shows how the academia and evolutionists of today are trying to squelch I.D. not by reasoning, but with brute force, which shows just how weak their stance really is. How was the universe created?  How did life begin?  These are questions that evolutionists have no answer to, not because they need more time to study it, but because it is already far too complicated for them come up with an ""It was an accident"" answer.  The only answer they will be able to give too: ""How did it all begin?"" is: ""I don't know.""  Really.  See the documentary for yourself.",1224979200,16,1422,4.541176470588235

3502261,5,B001BYLFFS,"What I am wondering is just how much of this DVD those of you who have posted negative reviews so far have seen.  In fact, ""Expelled"" clearly makes an excellent case for the fact that there exits in academia across this land a lethel bias against looking at both sides of an issue.

Now just how threatening is that, hmmmm?  Come on, folks.

Further, this film, with its high production values, also makes the point that it is being less than intellectually honest to sweep aside this evidence and conclusion and opt for a one-sided, politically correct viewpoint.  It is as if some folks just cannot see the forest through the trees.

Are we to blindly agree with Chicken Little that the sky is falling without checking the facts or at least SNOPES?

The DVD clearly proves with facts that institutions of ""higher learning"" are opting for ""indoctrination"" rather than education of their paying customers, especially when it comes to the topic of origins.

""Expelled"" brings out, through adept visual reporting, that, instead of educating their students to think and draw conclusions by researching and examining the facts of both sides of an issue, many colleges and universities choose to go so far as to censor, and even silence, qualified professors simply for bringing up the issue of intelligent design as a position to research, much less conclude it is a viable alternative to evolution.

So much for academic freedom!

Too, this DVD neither negates nor supports evolution or creation.  It simply proves that there is substantial evidence to support the fact that ""ideas have consequences"" (see below) and that some who fear certain ideas try to make them go away by blindly denying they exist, a very non academic, unintelligent, unscientific approach.

For example, how many consider, examine, research the fact it took only a matter of hours when Mt. St. Helens exploded to form the exact same rock strata some claim took millions of years to form in the Grand Canyon?

There is an adage by Mark Twain that says:  ""He, who is convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still"".

Expelled points out through solid investigative reporting, that many academians who claim to be evolutionists, remain blantantly blinded to, and ignore, the scientific facts that contradict their beliefs, but, due to adminstration pressure--you know, the specter of disappearing grant money--and peer pressure, choose not to conduct their own research or are fearful to do so to avoid reprisals (denial of tenure) or worse.

Those who have do, in fact, suffer censor and worse (dismissal) simply for being intellectually honest, which was once an excellent qualifying criteria for work as a professor in academia.

For example, I would challenge the reader to research the following web site [...] to find out what world view many of our early eminent scientists responsible for critical discoveries held.

But then, one would have to be willing to look at a view point that just might differ from the one they hold.

""Expelled"" further challenges the viewer to examine the beliefs of those who have embraced the ideas inculcated in evolution and the consequences when applied.  Two shown are Margaret Sanger who founded Planned Parenthood with the intent of systematically getting rid of what she termed ""dysingic stocks"" (i.e., Jews, blacks, Hispanics, et al) through abortion and Adolph [...], who brought Germany to ruin at the expense of the planned, methodical murder of millions of disabled, Christians and Jews, among others, based on the documented belief that he was simply speeding up the evolutionary process.

This DVD is a must see for all who are willing to put aside their biases and opt for intellectual honesty.  They will find it a refreshing, invogorating and freeing journey IF they are open and willing to let the truth free them from the bondage of being prisoner to ideas that have proven negative consequences.

Oh, and do not miss the incredibly revealing interview with Richard Dawkins.  You will not believe your eyes and ears.

Buy this product; you will not regret it...unless, of course, you cannot stand intellectual honesty!",1224892800,26,4154,5.020408163265306
3502262,5,B001BYLFFS,"It really is interesting that evolutionists/atheists would slam this movie so hard since it clearly shows to the world the vicious mean spiritedness with which they suppress dissent from their atheistic/materialistic world view. That people would actually question complexity in life that far surpasses man's ability to do as such seems to them retarded, yet one must ask ""What are they so afraid of to ask such a obvious question of such stunning complexity?"" Maybe they are terrified of the answer they may find if they were to honestly ask! Well contrary to their NA^ZI like enforcement of neo-darwinian policy, the truth will win the day. Indeed, Dr. Steven Meyers has stated that Darwinism will not survive the information biology of the 21st century. After witnessing some of the staggering complexity being revealed at even the ""simplest levels of molecular biology, I KNOW he is absolutely right.",1224892800,19,904,5.156462585034014
3502263,5,B001BYLFFS,"From looking at the breakout of the reviews, you either love this movie or hate it.  That breakout probably has most to do with whether or not you agree with the movie's point or not.  By and large it appears to me that those who don't like it demonstrate exactly what the movie is trying to point out, that those on ""the other side"" do not want a discussion.

The argument of the movie is not that Intelligent Design should supplant the pervasive teaching of Darwinism in our schools, but that there be room for the arguments of both sides about something which, when you come down to it, and considering the advancements made since Daarwin's day, is not a matter of science but of opinion.

In addition, compared to ""documentaries"" by, say, Michael Moore, the structure of the movie is extremely artistic and smart in its use of old and new screen footage to emphasize its concepts.  Again, unlike Moore's movies there are no outright lies in ""Expelled"", just a thoughtful examination of what is happening in the scientific ""establishment"" at this point in time.

A great book, available here on Amazon, that will help to understand the silliness of the anti-ID, exclusive side, and will serve as an appetizer or desert to Expelled, is David Berlinski's ""The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretensions"". Like ""Expelled"", it demonstrates the absurdity of the positions of people like Richard Dawkins, who have moved far beyond science and into the realm of creating their own religion.",1224892800,32,1500,4.862745098039215
3502274,5,B001BYLFFS,"Are we reviewing the movie or our own beliefs? It seems people love or hate the movie based on their own beliefs on origination.  So obviously you can tell by my rating what I believe.  I enjoyed it very much.  I was surprised that it was as interesting as it was.  The debate will never go away but the closed minded way that some people react to ideas that could possibly be contrary is surprising.  How can you know you're choosing correctly unless you fully study all possibilities.  I can't choose a product in a grocery store without weighing the options to ensure I'm getting the best deal, much less choosing a viewpoint on life.  Whether you believe in intelligent design or Darwinism or neo-Darwinism, have the courage to look at your beliefs for what they are and address the inexplicable.

I enjoyed the film.  I thought it was well done and presented in a very linear fashion.  I was unaware of how strong the anti- Intelligent Design faction was.  The fact that if a scientist is a believer in ID, has to be hidden and not mentioned, was astounding.  How can science be effective if it is closed minded?  It has always been science that came up with crazy long held ideas and then a rogue scientist that pushed the envelope enough to break down that idea and get at the truth.

I also found parts of the movie hilarious!! Crystals!  Organic life sprung from inorganic life on the backs of crystals?!  And the alien theory?  Some other highly advanced civilation came down to earth and planted the seed of organic life.. That is more likely than a creator???  LOL!  I stopped the dvd and laughed til i about cried.",1224892800,44,1627,4.529209621993127

3502277,4,B001BYLFFS,"I expected to sit through a documentary that would be a little scientific for my taste and dry to the point that I'd zone out and visit my happy places during the inevitable lectures. That said -- you have all now figured out that I'm not coming at this with a scientific or academic bent -- just your average American.

The buzz over Expelled had me curious and wondering what kind of chopped up snippets of conversation I might run into or how many unauthorized songs and words would be within. I didn't expect to experience the degrees of emotion I did or find the movie to be so well done that I only have two minor complaints.

I'm going to start with my complaints -- some of the interviews included background instrumentals that wrestled with the dialogue, and segments of live footage resulted in annoying choppiness bordering on motion queasiness. That's it.

Now, for the complaints of others -- Expelled is filmed with an agenda. That's the point, ala Michael Moore and Al Gore who went before Ben Stein. And every talk or interview program, newspaper or magazine editorial and feature, politician...well, I think you get my point. If you are enraged by the idea of someone investigating further into The Theory of Evolution vs. The Theory of Intelligent Design this documentary will further infuriate you. If you fall into this description, I recommend you pass.

For the curious or those who wonder ""why all the fuss"" by all means, see it. Stein's investigation uncovers a school of thought that in the extreme and natural course becomes terrifying when compared to where we've been and what we've seen historically. Of course, that's the interesting thing about extreme schools of thought, when embraced and pursued, they end up making a huge splash that creates ripples that are far-reaching.

I can't imagine that the folks that Stein interviewed were ignorant regarding his stand on the issue of Evolution vs. Intelligent Design. If they were, then they didn't do their homework and maybe, in that case, should have been less forthcoming and a little more cautious with their words. The interviews seemed intact, and the words that came out of peoples' mouths were still their own words unless Stein has some amazing technological genius. And unless I missed something, exactly two lines were used from John Lennon's Imagine and the words were clearly attributed to Lennon.

There were several sections of longer interviews and some shorter one question/one answer moments with experts on each side of this huge debate able to share their thoughts and opinions. Interspersed are historical film snippets both thought-provoking and quirky, graphics and an animated cell sequence that was stunning. Stein provided a handful of laugh-out-loud moments with his quirky behavior and snippets of commentary which added a softening to the heaviness of the film's subject matter.

I thought long and hard after watching Bowling for Columbine. I appreciate Moore's passion for what he feels is wrong with America, and I was able to overlook the moments his liberalism stepped on my toes. Ditto for Sicko. As a matter of fact, Sicko really resonated with me. Expelled presents information to consider as well.

In the end, the truth will trump any clever film-making or fact-twisting documentary. Look for the truth, investigate for yourself. Don't be afraid of this film. Don't be afraid of Michael Moore and Al Gore, either.",1224892800,8,3432,4.998248686514886
3502278,3,B001BYLFFS,"Whatever your views, all can agree with Ben Stein that the question of ID causes people to become impassioned. He correctly identifies that there are two Gospels - the ID Gospel and the Darwinian Gospel - neither are scientific fact, they are, in actuality, theories. Both pose serious problems and scientists know that. Both take faith in unseen and unanswered questions.

The most important point he brings up about ID is why it has not gone away. The status quo states that ID has already been debated and rejected, and there is nothing left to say. However, theories that have not been *adequately* answered have a way of sticking around. ID has not been adequately answered by science and those who reject the theory routinely refuse those who want to talk about it free scientific inquiry, chastising them and expelling them from the scientific community. This type of biased science that is not open to free inquiry has damaged the scientific community.

What really fascinated me about Richard Dawkins and other atheist evolutionists is how they turn to aliens as a possibility for life on earth. Even the atheists turn to the sky looking for answers - it is a new mythology rooted in the scientific community, and that my friends, is great irony.

3502279,5,B001BYLFFS,"For many of the people who gave this documentary 1 star I seriously have to question if you even saw the movie.  Stein isn't trying to promote Intelligent Design or Creationism but he does want the debate open and freely taught in schools without fear of reprisal.  Yes, he exposes some obvious errors of the theory but he does it effectively by using the words of evolutionists themselves.

If there was even a question of whether evolution leads to atheism both Myers and Dawkins put that to rest as both explain this happening in their lives.  Dawkins even goes on to explain how life began on earth, aliens.  Yes that is right aliens, enough said.  It is clear that Dawkins isn't against Intelligent Design he just hates God as described in the Bible.  On top of this Michael Ruse tries to explain that life originated on the ""backs of crystals"" and gets very irate at Stein for not understanding this theory.

What is clear is that evolution does not give any explanation for the origins of life but it does give an excuse for governments to exterminate people who are considered to be undesirable.  Even today the government of Ontario in Canada is trying to exterminate Downs Syndrome people through abortion by requiring all doctors to screen for this ""abnormality"".  We lash out against the Nazi's and their extermination methods and yet accept similar methods in our own western world world through abortion.

Why don't we leave origins out of the science class and put it where it belongs, in Philosophy or Religious studies.",1224892800,10,1536,4.78030303030303

3502281,4,B001BYLFFS,"If there was one person to make a case for Intelligent Design, Ben Stein would be the one to do it.  Starting out with the premise that ""Freedom is the essence of America,"" Stein's documentary `Expelled:  No Intelligence Allowed' proposes that proponents of Intelligent Design have been ostracized, demonized, and left out of the scientific discussion about the origins in life.  Citing professors and scientists, Stein narrates his debate, making no doubt he sides with freedom of expression and at least sympathizes with the believers of Intelligent Design.

Of course 'Expelled...' is destined to be controversial.  What is so concretely admirable is how Stein gives time to both sides to state their cases so eloquently, so viewers can understand both sides.  Cogent talk from Robert J. Mark II, a professor who had his web site taken down to Richard Dawkins, best-selling author of 'The God Delusion,' Stein keeps it fascinating even if it's tilted in a certain direction.

The other laudable facet of the film is how Stein is able to define ""Intelligent Design"" and make it clear and understandable.  Using a plethora of experts, the DVD is informative for at least conveying what Intelligent Design actually is and what it states.  Noting that Darwin's theory of evolution is merely that, he is able to use fascinating scientific evidence that demonstrate holes in some of his conclusions.  One of the most prevalent defenses of Intelligent Design is that nature is so ""intricate"" and has so many remarkable patterns, it can't be duplicated and couldn't have come from nowhere on its own.  The origin of life has yet to be explained, and the whole idea of life springing from a ""primordial soup"" is yet to be proven.

But the main lamentation is regarding freedom or inquiry or thought.  Ben Stein primarily demonstrates how Intelligent Design scientists are left out for being ""religion dressed up as science"".  Stein makes the case that a whole sector of the scientific community is being left out of the scientific process.  It's the whole God/ and or religion vs. science debate, and for many people it's either or.  His second case is showing how, in certain ways, evolution has been devastatingly influential since `Origin of the Species' inception.  Eugenics is cited as a horrible hybrid of evolution. After all, if man is just considered another animal, what follows can be pretty inhumane.

The multi-talented Ben Stein gives the right touch to his topic.  Using ""Love Is in the Air"" during narration in one scene, he adds nice touches to lighten things up.  As an established figure on Comedy Central, Stein uses all the wit and intelligence in his arsenal to make a cogent case for freedom of thought and expression.

Personal reflection:  I thought it would be helpful to 'fess up and state my own personal biases.  I happen  to believe in both intelligent design and evolution.  One thing the movie doesn't address is that the Bible was written well before man entered a scientific-centered culture.  Genesis, which is frequently the center-piece of the debate, I believe is 100% true, but not meant to be viewed as a science journal.  It's a book of truth about the meaning of creation.  Yet, it's meaning to me is infinitely more useful than all the scientific journals put together.  Awe of creation are indicators to the nature of the Almighty as seen by the awe by the state of innocence of pre-fallen man.  The seven day construct is perhaps man's consciousness and his relationship to God for whom he has been made in His image.  Many scientists see an either or relationship because they take a literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis and reject it as ""unscientific"".  Evolution, on the other hand, tells us about the how of creation.  To paraphrase movie critic, Roger Ebert, there's too much evidence on earth of evolution and the eons which brought us its splendor.

Whether you agree with one side or both, 'Expelled:  No Intelligence Allowed' is worth a look.

3502282,5,B001BYLFFS,"This is a great documentary.  It shows what happens when you ask the question you were taught never to ask.  ""Scientists,"" ""experts,"" those of ""higher"" education are all interviewed.  They are all asked simply, ""From where did life come?""

No one can answer.  Oh, they speak on and on about their theories, but never can solve the riddle and their answers avoid the obvious.  You asked this same question when you were young.  You quickly learned that you never got a satisfying answer and you were not to ever ask it again.

Unfortunately, the ""enlightened elitists"" respond not solving the mystery, but by attacking those that suggest that life may not be an accident.

No matter what you believe, if you're honest, you'll have to admit how today's scientists aren't any more knowledgeable about the truth than anyone from our distant past.

Today's ""scientific"" community is more of a cult.  If you go outside the bounds of what is politically correct, you are shunned or worse.

3502283,5,B001BYLFFS,"I find it hysterical that the Darwin Kool-Aid drinkers are flocking to bad mouth this film. The vitriol that you see in the negative reviews are exactly what Ben Stein made the film about, in fact they validate this movie. The film was superb.  It was a real eye-opener.  I am not particularly religious, nor am I a Creationist.  I, like everyone else was force-fed Darwinism and blindly accepted it as simply the way it was.  A close friend who began talking about Intelligent Design a few years ago sounded like a religious freak.  I wrote his comments off as religious fanaticism.  After watching ""Expelled"", I am seriously looking at paying attention to what the Intelligent Design people have to say.",1224806400,22,705,4.785123966942149
3502304,4,B001BYLFFS,"I saw the movie and enjoyed it. Everyone that is for free speech and reasoned discourse should see the movie -- irrespective of where you stand on Intelligent Design.

Don't buy into the hysteria generated by those that unjustly equate Intelligent Design with Creationism (through either malice or ignorance). Intelligent Design and Creationism have nothing to do with one another. Intelligent Design is a research program that seeks to use math, science, and reason to reliably detect design within biological lifeforms and structures. It makes a design inference but makes no attempt to identify the designer. Much as a forensic scientist determines whether cause of death is natural or designed but leaves the identity of the murderer to those better suited for the task, Intelligent Design simply seeks to detect design within biology. The implications of that inference are interesting but not, strictly speaking, within the scope of Intelligent Design.

The point of the movie is simple: there is very little freedom within academia to dissent from the party line (Darwinism) in regards to the origin and development of life. Careers, tenure, reputation, etc. are at risk if any aspect of the materialistic, naturalistic, random-chance-only explanation is questioned by those in academia. The movie does a good job of making that point. It also does a good job of explaining why it matters. The best example was the clear evidence presented that shows that Darwinism and the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" was in part used to justify the horrors of Nazi Germany (not to mention the eugenics movements that swept across Europe and America in the early part of the 20th century). The movie clearly (and fairly) states that support for Darwinism does not guarantee something as obscene as Nazi Germany. However, there is no doubt that Darwin's ideas *were* used to, in part, justify what became shameful, horrific behavior. For that reason, this movie is not only worth watching, it's important -- important because it clearly shows why no idea should be exempt from reasoned dissent.

Having followed the Intelligent Design movement closely for years, I believe it is well-reasoned but still developing as a theory. As the leaders in the Intelligent Design movement have clearly stated, it's not time to teach Intelligent Design as an accepted theory. However, the controversy and the concepts can (and should be) open for discussion. This movie shows that simply isn't being allowed.",1224806400,16,2494,5.199004975124378

This documentary by Ben Stein is incredibly revealing in its depiction of how scientists throughout the US have been discriminated against for merely mentioning ""Intelligent Design.""
I found the connection between Darwinism, Eugenics and Planned Parenthood completely jaw-dropping.  Perhaps the most notable moment of the whole film is Ben Stein's conversation with Richard Dawkins at the end of the film.  Of all the evolutionists out there I would have never expected Dawkins to suggest the ""cosmic germination"" theory as a possible explanation for how self-dividing cells arrived on our planet.  I think Ben Stein had the perfect response to this alien Johnny Appleseed theory suggested by some of the world most renowned scientists and thinkers when he says ""I expected science, not science fiction!""

Whether you're on the ID or Darwinist side of this debate, science is about open inquiry.  How can we have open inquiry when anyone who proposes a theory other than the one the establishment agrees on is immediately defamed, blackballed, and refused tenure?

But what the film is really about is the way darwinists denounce anyone who doesn't get in their line and conform.  What the movie is really about is the squashing of academic freedom.  If you care about academic freedom, if you care about the state of the university in America, then this movie should concern you.

Will this movie give you a primer in ID?  Yes.  Will it give you a primer in naturalistic evolution?  Yes.  Will it give you a primer in the state of academic freedom in America today?  Yes.  For anyone who is concerned about any of those things, I recommend it.

Basically, all Ben Stein does is ask thought-provoking questions that would likely cause the staunchest Darwinian evolutionist to squirm.  Any seeker of truth should not feel threatened by this film.  The efforts being made to suppress the viewing and sales of this film should raise the eyebrows of all who defend freedom of speech and press.

The reaction by the unintelligent designers (UD's) is more heat than light.  The fact that thinking scientists can dare to oppose a nontheistic philosophy base for inquiry is... well, heresy.  The UD inquisition has been loosed and heads are already rolling.

Stein's logic is never answered by his opponents.  His questions remain, while shouted down as moronic and unscientific by those who disagree.  Why can't the opposition simply produce a credible model for the origin of life?  ""Backs of crystals"" anyone?  Is this more intelligent than intelligence?

Where Stein hits the nerve is his connection between Darwinism and the German treatment of Jews under Hitler.  The cries of ""foul play"" are again never answered.  If Stein is correct here, and it remains to be seriously debated, the scientific community's embrace of Darwinism against intelligent design is a flaw that will only lead to further damage to the dignity of humanity.",1224806400,29,1089,5.125
3502310,5,B001BYLFFS,"Stein in a entertaining, yet informative way, explores the possibility that the Elite Media/Academy is deliberately trying to control the thoughts of America in regards to the origins of life issue.  What is enjoyable and thought provoking is the use of Black and White movie clips which illustrate this in other, more political uses of the theme: Walled Off, Freedoms removed images.  Also, the musical score chosen is well done and entertaining.

The Elite's sure and swift response to the challenge of Intelligent Design is hereby probed as to: why or what are they so scared of, to let another model of the origins of life be explored?  Makes one seriously think that something much more than just science is at stake here.  It is not a war between science and religion, but rather than for many, science has become their religion.  Notice how many of this persuasion just put names and labels on anyone daring enough to challenge their sacred Darwinism as brain deficient, etc.  Let our side not respond in kind.

What is clear from this documentary as well from one's exploring talking with scientists is: not all of them believe in Darwinism as a sufficient explanation of the origins of life.  When they say in what should be ""academic, societal freedom"" this, they are typically ostracized and characterized as non-scientists or deficient scientists.  It does not take evolutionary belief at all to do great science in any area?

Further, the evidence the Darwinists have and can muster to date do not sufficiently convince many, including many scientists who are not religious, that it is true.

3502311,4,B001BYLFFS,"It seems like every year we get one or two documentaries that are cheered by one side of the political/religious aisle and booed by the other.  This was the first one out of the gate this year.

This documentary purports to follow actor Ben Stein around as he looks into the charges of blacklisting by the scientific community of scientists who support Intelligent Design.  It starts with a few examples of those fired from their jobs or had grants pulled for even daring to mention the name.  From there he explores what Intelligent Design is, if there are any potential stumbling blocks for Evolution, and the long term effects of belief in Evolution.  All this is done with a series of fast moving interviews interspersed with Ben Stein's dry wit and clips from old movies and news reels to enliven the interviews.

Now I am going to be right up front with you.  I am a Christian and believe in Creation.  (And yes, as the film explains, there is a difference between Creation and Intelligent Design.)  So I was expecting to like the film.  While I did feel there were so flaws, I pretty much did like it.

This documentary packs so much stuff into the 90 minutes, it's hard not to feel overwhelmed.  Fortunately, with the movie now out on DVD, you can rewind and watch parts again to make sure you understand what everyone is saying.

With one brief exception, the focus of this film isn't science.  The focus is on academic freedom.  That's why the film begins with interviewed of those who are blacklisted by the scientific community for daring to even speak the words in passing in a class.  There are also interviews with leading Evolutionists.  The words they use to describe those who believe in Intelligent Design is amazing.  While most just call them stupid, one goes so far as to call the IDers ""Academic Terrorists.""

The brief science section discusses the creation of a cell.  It comes up as the documentary tries to show the one question that Intelligent Design tries to answer that Evolution doesn't, where did life come from?  My head began to swim as they described just how complex one cell really is.

Twice, Mr. Stein tried to get Evolutionists to tell us where life comes from.  One starting exposing a theory on crystals.  It was actually funny watching how frustrated he got when Mr. Stein didn't get it.  Even more amazing was the quote that ends the movie.  Dr. Richard Hawkins, a self-proclaimed (quite proudly) evolutionist and atheist gives his response.  It's jaw dropping.  You have to see it to believe it.

But this documentary does have some flaws.  The attempts to be stylish and edgy by showing people's hands or their mouth only when they were talking didn't work for me.  There was enough interesting stuff going on they could have just given us a straight ""talking head"" shot and it would have actually been better.  Second, once they identified an interview subject, they never told us his or her name again.  Frankly, I found that frustrating since I couldn't keep track of who everyone was.

But the biggest flaw of the documentary was the invoking of Hitler and the Nazis.  Ben Stein sets about proving that the holocaust was a direct result of Hitler buying into Darwin's survival of the fittest.  This is something I would need to do a whole lot more research on before I considered buying into.  But the quote from Darwin about humans needing to be breed like dogs certainly did make me want to learn more.

The problem with the section, however, is that it opens the documentary up for attacks by those who want to dismiss it.  It makes an easy target.  And, since there just wasn't time to fully expand on it and prove it sufficiently, it just weakens things.  If they had taken these 15 minutes and used them to fully drive home other points in the documentary that they almost made, it would have been a big help.  Heck, this could have been a subject for a follow up documentary if Ben Stein felt this strongly about it.

As I was watching the film, I knew exactly what it would do.  And I've been right.  Like so many other controversial documentaries, it excited the people who already believe its premise while enraging those who didn't.  Frankly, it saddens me that we can't take the time to fairly listen to one another and argue based on facts and logic instead of name calling and emotion.  But we are too entrenched in our own ideas to listen to anyone else.  Even sadder, I fall into this trap too often myself.

So here's my challenge to you.  Watch this documentary for yourself.  Read up on what it says.  Read what the other side of the debate says.  Try to get past all the name calling on both sides to view the facts.  Then make up your own mind.  This is too important a subject to just ignore.",1224720000,9,4765,4.575147928994083

3502323,5,B001BYLFFS,"Watching Ben Stein's documentary, Expelled - No Intelligence Allowed, was a breath of fresh air from the rushed and cheapened documentaries of late.

Ben's position and perspective in taking on this difficult subject is fantastic, whether you agree or disagree in the end. As the story goes, he stumbles upon a science geek that has been dejected by science geek bullies. One after another, rejected for opposing the strong current of installed pro-Darwin thought in our schools, our country. The documentary kept me intrigued as I shared Ben's interest into why a scientific community would be afraid to allow a colleague to think outside of the box. What unravels is what I suspect - a group that is proud, confident, perhaps cocky and egotistical. Unwilling to listen to little more than their own breast pounding words. This sort of thing is rarely exposed. I commend those that spoke out, who unfortunately have suffered for speaking their mind.

Apart from the intention of this documentary, I took away something else about the behavior of ""smart"" people in general. It's rare to find someone that is quick to listen, and slow to speak. There are proud bullies in every career, and the scientific community probably has a higher average than the rest of the world.

Another thought that still rings through my ears is the fact that every part of our society has people that get erratic when talk of a deity or higher power is involved in things that pertain to them. ""Expelled"" points out that Intelligent Design, while not pointing a finger at any specific religion or god, yields the same result among scientists as Christmas does in atheists. Why do so many find discussions of higher intelligence so offensive?

Ben, perhaps those doing the expelling are afraid of dealing with the BIG question - what if I was made (as opposed to happenstance)?

Expelled is thought provoking, makes its discoveries in an artful way, great production quality, and nice material for anyone wanting to share the argument for ID with others.

1. Honest men/women and True scientists look for objective truth, with no preconceptions, biases, or prejudices. What matters is finding what's real, no matter how unlikely or absurd.

2. Some who are scientists (and many who know just enough to be dangerous) don't realize that it's unscientific to try to ""make things the way you want them to be.""
Case in point"": the medical community for years laughed at the idea that viruses could cause cancer...until someone proved it.
Another case in point: scientists scoffed for years at the idea that stomach ulcers could be caused by bacteria, because no bacteria, they thought, could survive in such an acidic environment. A Nobel prizewinner ignored the educated idiots and proved this was the case. The list of such ""scientific community"" idiocies could go on and on.
Having prejudices based on one's present state of knowledge/ignorance is an unscientific attitude.

3. Limiting the search for answers (i.e., ""science"") solely to natural causes is unscientific. If you're looking for truth and reality, why do you care where it comes from? Unless, of course, you're really just an anti-religious bigot that is using the guise of ""science"" to bash people with.

4. For something to be a valid scientific theory is to say that ""a thing happens this way, and no other way."" It establishes a cause and effect relationship.

5. The bases for many people's unbeliefs rest on theories like evolution. Evolution CANNOT be proven in the same say that laws of physics and chemistry can be proven. The laws of physics and chemistry can be demonstrated ad infinitum with experiments in front of our eyes, given the right equipment and materials. We see them demonstrated in the modern world every day. These are doubtless.

Not so, for evolution.
That is, because we don't have a time machine, we cannot do an evolution experiment that involves changes of species or see the instant where random molecules joined in the primordial soup to become primitive DNA.
We can't sit and wait for millions of years for the theorized processes to obtain their theorized outcomes.
  Yes, animals and humans adapt and are changed by environment. This doesn't prove that random chemicals met, became a living being, kept experiencing random genetic mutations that gave them the ability to best survive, eventually formed eyes, a brain, arms and legs, became human, and ""here we are today.""

Thus, it is wholly unscientific to dismiss other, non-evolutionary theories based on one's prejudices, because evolution is not a provable theory as are theories in other hard sciences.",1224720000,21,2750,5.0798226164079825
3502325,3,B001BYLFFS,"The issue with those who reject intelligent design is not due to lack of evidence. Rather, it is the moral inability that leads to unwillingness to believe. If I were to name the ultimate evidence of intelligent design, I would go with the Bible. But let's say one objects, I would then recommend Guillermo Gonzalez's ""The Privileged Planet,"" among many others. Michael Behe's ""Darwin's Black Box"" is another credible reference. This inability and unwillingness to believe is what Ben Stein fails to mention in the documentary movie. It does an excellent job in showing what is going on in the academic communities today in the United States primarily. It shows what the problem and the resulting danger is. But it does not go to the root of the problem and its solution. The root of the problem is the fundamental presupposition of man-centered materialistic worldview. Unless this ultimate trust and heart commitment is changed, to borrow the terms from Prof. John Frame, it is hard, if not impossible to change one's mind. In other words, man-centered naturalistic and materialistic worldview naturally leads to evolution-centered post-modernistic science, just like what Prof. John Lennox of Oxford says, that it is not science that drives worldviews, it is the other way around. I wholeheartedly agree with his comment. Now that we know what the root of the problem is, the solution is the miraculous work of God to give a believing heart that believes the gospel that conquers all hindrances to faith; unbelief, pride, rebellious spirit to name a few.

Despite the deficiencies, however, I still recommend ""Expelled"" to educate and raise awareness to the public about the seemingly perennial debate between creationists and evolutionists, because the implication of embracing the one and not the other goes much farther than the academic world, but reaches down to the very dignity and future of humanity as well, and most importantly, the glory of God, which I know, the very mention of it might leave a bad taste in the atheists' and evolutionists' mouth.",1224720000,11,2063,5.0855457227138645

Ben Stein & Co. travel around the country (and world) asking why it's so ""verboten"" (forbidden) to advance the theory (or even mention) that organic life might have been created deliberately rather than arising spontaneously from a mud puddle and a bolt of lightning (or whatever).  They interview many notable figures on both sides of this question (most hilariously Richard Dawkins).  And they come away with some very interesting observations.

Most notable among their observations is that academic freedom is CLEARLY being stifled by people who have a lot to lose, credibility-wise and dollar-wise, if competing views of the world are allowed to gain any traction.  Big Science is also Big Business, as Ben points out.

3502330,5,B001BYLFFS,"If ""Big Science"" is truly science it should be big enough to withstand being questioned.  Science is a body of knowledge or a system of knowledge concerned with phenomena that can be measured, studied, analyzed, and questioned.  It is a pursuit of knowledge. It is problem solving.  It is the collection of data.  Anything that is truly a scientific hypothesis can be questioned.  A scientific theory is a statement that has been proved; it is not a figment of someone's imagination.

Darwin developed his hypothesis (which everybody now refers to as a theory) of evolution 150 years ago.  Since then scientists have learned about some things Darwin didn't know about, for example,  DNA, microbiology, The Big Bang, and Eisnstein's theory of relativity.  Many scientists -- more and more all the time -- are exmining Darwin's simple idea that life is the result of a random and purposeless event.  There is more to the universe than Darwin every knew.  Actually Darwin stated ideas that contradicted each other.

EXPELLED is a factual account of the way that some people in the scientific community have rejected  the idea of Intelligent Design and anyone who has questioned Darwin.  To hold tight to old ideas is a simplistic approach denying intelligent people the opportunity to reason.

Many intellectuals have their minds made up ahead of time that life is random and purposeless.  They are threatened by the idea that there could be an an intelligence superior to humankind.  These people are frightened to admit that God exists.  In nations where people claim to have the ability to be open-minded, this subject is closed and suppressed.  The secular humanist point of view, which  requires complete subservience, is actually a religion, not a science.  Sadly it is a religion that cannot be questioned.

EXPELLED  as the trailers say  is ""some movie."" It is very witty, acerbic, and cerebral.  Don't miss it.

3502345,5,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein says that his main goal in making this documentary is to point out that a wall exists in academia between Darwinists and those who would entertain the idea of Intelligent Design for explaining existence.  He then wants to show that in academia you are only allowed to live on the Darwin side of that wall.  There is no acceptance for even dalliance on the Intelligent Design side of the wall.

Stein effectively does several things in this film. He demonstrates that scientists who ascribe to the Intelligent Design theory are no less brilliant, educated, articulate, experienced and visionary that the Darwinists.  That fact cannot be argued.  Yet these scientists are called as nutcases, idiots, creationists, fanatics, amateurish, etc.  (Just read some reviews here and you'll see the same labels.

Stein shows that discoveries in molecular biology especially have undermined Darwin's theory of simplicity of species origins.  We know now that the single cell is anything but simple and has no precursor from which it could have evolved.  Darwinism and pure evolution are shown to have major gaps.

Darwinism is placed in a context of history and logical conclusions.  Stein reveals the connection between Darwin's survival of the species, natural selection, and Nazism and its desire for a greater race of people. This is no doubt upsetting to Darwinists, but Stein in fact quotes Darwin and Nazis to support his claims.

He shows that those who espouse Darwinism and undirected evolution despise the idea of Intelligent Design.  In his interviews with these people they behave quite abnormal in their egocentricity.  This is where the film is at its best and reveals the truth about these scientists who refuse to consider Intelligent Design: They have no idea how life began.  One scientists claims living cells ""piggy-backed"" onto crystals and sprang to life. It made no sense.

The best scene and climax is Stein interview with Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion and media darling of secularism, etc.  Stein simply asks ""How did that happen?"" regarding life.  Dawkins becomes visibly shaken and actually admits that an intelligent designer must have at least ""seeded"" the planet with life. It is amazing that these people adhere to wacky ideas of crystals forming life, aliens or higher forms seeding the primordial soup with life, anything rather than admit Intelligent Design offers a coherent theory of life that makes sense.

Stein also asserts that scientists who reject Intelligent Design are not debating or defending science.  They are shown to be defending a world view that does not include an Intelligent Designer or God.  Because they are not defending their science, they are deriding, insulting, labeling, and stereotyping Intelligent Design advocates.  That is their case and strategy.  They want to keep the wall up and protect their worldview.

You don't hear advocates of Intelligent Design calling Darwinists names and refusing to debate with them.  Because the Intelligent Design scientists are bright and confident in their stance. They are willing to go to the plate and let science work it out. Currently, they are not allowed on the field. I hope that changes.",1224633600,21,3211,5.164410058027079

The movie isn't about proving ID.  So to reviewers who state: ""no proof of ID was provided"".  The point wasn't to prove ID, it was to prove that educational foundations prohibit people from considering ID as a possibility.

While they touch on providing evidence supporting ID, proving ID is as possible, at this point, as proving evolution, which if could be done we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Possibly the zealousness in which Intelligent Design is denounced is due a fear that dates back to the treatment Galileo and more recently the battles our public school system suffered when tying to introduce Evolution.

3502350,5,B001BYLFFS,"Unfortunately, in these days, it seems that science is no longer about resolving to find the right answer, even if one does not like the implications. Such is revealed in Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. The truth is out: REAL SCIENTISTS are being ""expelled,"" removed, and even denied tenor because of their belief in an intelligent cause behind life. These are not people who are not scientists, these are real scientists that are really being persecuted for their non-Darwinian beliefs.

For instance, scientists have found that located within DNA is literally a language/code of complexity far beyond our own. In fact, Bill Gates, the founder of Windows, and expert in computing languages, has this to say about it:  ""DNA is like a software program, only much more complex than anything we've ever devised."" ALL known complex-specified languages/coding have only been known to arrive by intelligence. There is literally NO known natural law or naturalistic explanation that can even come to explaining this outside of intelligence. Intelligence, as the cause behind this language/coding, is the most reasonable explanation.

In fact paleontologists use this venue of thinking all the time in their scientific studies. If a paleontologist finds a slab of stone with an unknown language scratched into it, they would not infer that natural forces, such as rain and wind, caused the language to appear on stone. They infer intelligence, and this is thought to be the most rational explanation. But why is that? Well, it's because we know that anywhere complex-specified information appears, we know that intelligence is behind it. It's not even a question, it's simply the best possible answer, given the data.

This is what those of intelligent design suggest when they find language/coding in DNA, as well as when scientists find highly complex nano-machines within cells. They say these findings are obviously the result of intelligence. To those, such as Darwinists, who suggest that Intelligent Design is not science, and stick dogmatically to their just-so evolutionary story, they are actually saying that studies such as paleontology are not science. Yet we know that assuredly paleontology is a science, and to suggest otherwise is just silly. Unfortunately though, as I said earlier, pro-intelligent design theorists are being ridiculed and rejected as scientists, teachers, and so on, simply because they do not see unguided natural processes as the best, or most reasonable, explanation.

This movie reveals the dark truth about suppression of speech and critical thinking, and the dogmatism of neo-Darwinists in their views. Basically: If you don't agree with neo-Darwinism (the idea that all of life arose by natural selection and random mutations), you're not a scientists, and you're pushing your religious agendas! So we're going to reject you from the scientific community, even if it means firing or lying to get rid of you!

Apparently if you believe in intelligent design, you must be religious, but such is not that case. The truth is that those of intelligent design do not even seek to explain the source of intelligence, simply that it was designed. Richard Dawkins, an atheist, even admits that it's possible that first life was created and planted on earth by creatures, such as aliens (although he says they must have evolved themselves). So you don't even have to be religious to believe in intelligent design.

America is founded on the freedom of speech, and science should be, if it is not, about coming to the most rational conclusion, even if it goes against neo-Darwinian thinking.

Over all the movie does a very good job at exposing the reality of Darwinists who would rather destroy all scientific alternatives, than admit their theory is wrong.

3502351,1,B001BYLFFS,"There are several major problems with this film:

1. Neither theory (Intelligent Design or Evolution) is defined or given evidence for, or given evidence for its weaknesses, even though many, many times evolution is said to have lots of holes in it.  It makes me think 'just because you say it, doesn't make it true.'  The one piece of 'evidence' I did hear - 'Natural selection reduces genetic complexity' is a bald-faced lie.

2. The presentation of the people who were 'expelled' is extremely one-sided.  No matter how flat you make a pancake, it still has 2 sides.  I urge the viewers to go to expelledexposed.com to read the other side of this particular pancake, do your own research, and draw your own conclusions on whether the people in the film were treated fairly or not.

3. Stein doesn't understand that scientific theory is not quite a free for all, as far as freedom of speech goes.  Scientific theory is more accurately defined as freedom of speech, tempered by reason and backed with evidence.  A scientist may choose to pursue and study any hypothesis they wish, however if they want to present their hypothesis as a serious argument, they must present evidence along with it.  I actually can't think of a single piece of evidence for ID that wasn't refuted.  Most 'ID evidence' is actually attempting to disprove evolution, but one must understand that even if evolution is disproved tomorrow, that will not make ID correct by default.  Furthermore, any controversy with ID should be decided in the academic arena, not in schools with children who know only the fundamentals of basic science at best.  They're not yet learned enough to make such a complex decision.

4. Evolution does not attempt to explain the origins of life, only the diversity of life.  Abiogenesis attempts to explain the origins of life.  I did not understand this particular tangent at all when the topic of the film is clearly about ID and evolution.

5.  Why do they use the term 'Darwinist'??  We don't use this term in serious conversation, we don't call people 'Newtonists' or 'Einsteinists.'  It's a ridiculous attempt to attach a leader figure to evolution, a prophet, someone who could be brought down and if he is brought down, so is evolution.  It doesn't work that way.  The current scientific theory of evolution in reality has very little resemblance to what Darwin proposed.

6.  The film furthers the untruth that science and religion are incompatible.  Evolution does not and never has, and never will posit whether there is a God or not.  It's not a concern in science - science is the study of natural phenomena and God, being supernatural, falls outside of science.  It is perfectly acceptable for any scientist to say that he personally believes God guided the evolution of man to his current form.  The problems come in when he attempts to present this belief as scientific fact, because there is no evidence for such a belief.

7.  The disgusting attempt to connect evolution to the Holocaust.  It's a real manipulative piece of work, and has about as much bearing as attaching physics theories to Nazism because they used such theories in the creation of their weaponry.  Just because a bad person appropriates a scientific theory and twists it to his own means does not discount the theory.  Evolution is a tool, like a hammer.  If a hammer is used to kill someone, does that make all hammers bad and evil, or the bearer of that one particular hammer evil?

8.  Some classic quote-mining from Darwin himself.  Do yourself a favor and read the entire quote: ""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.

The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.""

9.  Stein COMPLETELY misinterprets what Dawkins was trying to say with this alien civilization scenario.  Dawkins even said that even if ID happened in this way, the aliens themselves would have to be explained through some natural phenomena such as evolution.  And ultimately, that's the biggest problem I have with ID.  Okay, say it's true, it happened, there is an intelligent designer.  Then where did this designer come from?  Did he evolve; was he created, and if so, who created him?  And so on, and so on.  ID doesn't actually answer any questions, it just moves them one step away.  It doesn't explain or further science in any way.

In the end, I found this 'documentary' to be manipulative propaganda, not presenting any real arguments for the case of ID, and only creating this phantasm that is 'Big Science' so they could have a punching bag to beat on.  They give very little support to their claims, much of what they do give I suspect is incorrect given my current understanding of the situation.

Anyone who is capable of separating scientific discovery from fantasy will recognize this movie as kissing the behind of religious fantasy in the face of evidence that conclusively contradicts the ""THEORY of Intelligent Design"".

The most appalling aspect of this movie is the way in which they interviewed scholars, plying them with trick questions, then taking their comments completely out of context to make their point, contrary to the beliefs of those they interviewed.

Check out Richard Dawkins website for his comments on this movie.

I once had respect for Ben Stein, but this movie has shown me that his perspective is either completely contrary to mine or he is using a popular issue to line his pockets.

To those who believe ID is real, do your homework (with an open mind). It just doesn't fit the facts.",1224547200,16,980,4.844311377245509

The middle part on the connection of Darwin and the Nazis is true, for what it is worth. It may not be relevant to pro-Darwin people today, but the fact is that there was a connection of American Eugenics and European Nazism with Darwinism.

The interview with Dawkins talking about space aliens is worth the price of the movie by itself. And my kids got a blast of how Dawkins couldn't say the word ""religion"" without choking.",1224547200,11,581,4.420560747663552

3502375,4,B001BYLFFS,"The movie is good. The firestorm around it is nothing short of *amazing*. Unfortunately, I don't mean that latter statement in a good way.

""Expelled"" examines the fact that much of science, academia, and the media do not stop short of simply dismissing the concepts of intelligent design (a.k.a. ID), but refuse to allow the topic to even be discussed. Hosted by Ben Stein, the movie starts with some examples of this issue. Stein admits to some early cynicism -- that this is all just over-blown hype.

If one is objective, this cynicism is understandable. Many proponents of ID claim the name of Christ, and (unfortunately) many Christians are alarmists, self-made martyrs, and conspiracy theorists that would put Oliver Stone to shame. But sometimes, when the boy cries ""wolf"", the sheep really are in danger. In the first 20 minutes or so, ""Expelled"" shows us:

  * professors and research scientists whose ""contracts were not renewed"" by their university (read: fired) because they pursued ID theories
  * an established journalist who has many of her articles vetted before publication, because she once wrote about ID in a non-dismissive way
  * a scientist and journal editor who lost his job simply for publishing an article written by an ID proponent

Sadly, most of the *reactions* are the actual over-blown hype. Even more sadly, they're incredibly predictable.

The movie uses the metaphor of the Berlin Wall, its separation of people and ideas, and its shutting out of ideas. This metaphor gets jumped on mindlessly by the film's critics, somehow taking a metaphor and twisting it to declare that Stein sees an absolute moral equivalence between the hatred and malice that spawned the Wall and the issues that he is trying to discuss. It's called an illustration, people. You learn about it in the first month of the average high school public-speaking class.

While the film's main point is not to support ID nor defeat Darwinism, both topics are fairly unavoidable when discussing the latter's staunch hold and the shutting out of the former. As Stein notes, ""In my experience, people who are confident in their ideas are not afraid of criticism.""

And so some of the film's scrutiny does, indeed, fall on Darwinism, and some of its suspect implications -- the criticism that Darwinists are allegedly unafraid of.

""Expelled"" notes the fact that there are some parallels between Darwinism and Nazism, quoting some genuinely scary passages written by Charles Darwin and noting that Hitler attributed some of the theories in ""Mein Kampf"" to his reading of Darwin. Once again, the film's critics jump on the non-existent statement of moral equivalence, despite the fact that one of Stein's interviewees says point-blank that no one is saying that Darwinism leads to Nazism.

Interestingly, I have not read a lot about the one portion of the film that I thought would generate the loudest dissent among the non-thinkers. Some of the afore-mentioned passages of Darwin nearly scream of eugenic theory (particularly when he notes -- critically -- that the human race generally does not weed out its own ""weaker"" elements). Stein then goes on to note that Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a staunch eugenicist. Given the sacred status that abortion has been given in our society, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more outcry.

There is some levity, too, both in the movie and the issues surrounding it. In the interviews that Stein conducted, several Darwinists admitted that Darwinism only ""begins"" once the first cell has life, and that ""no one knows"" how that first cell came to life. One scientist (and I use that term loosely) posited the theory that life began on the backs of crystals, conjuring images of Abby O'Neil (Finkelstein) from ""Dharma & Greg"".

Stein also conducted an extensive interview with Richard Dawkins, noted author and staunch atheist. When he wasn't fumbling for answers to fairly straightforward questions, Dawkins made several convoluted statements. Stein attempted to untangle these by asking, ""So, you are willing for the theory to be disseminated that life possibly began by the 'seeding' of aliens, but you are unwilling to allow for the theory that life was first produced by a god of any nature?"" Dawkins seriously affirmed Stein's summation.

(I'm sure that Robin Williams will be happy to know that Mork from Ork is what passes for serious science these days.)

Interestingly, Dawkins later claimed not to know who Stein was when he granted the interview, and has stated that he would not have done the interview had he known more about Stein and/or the nature of the film. What a shame that someone who has sold hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of books is too poor to hire a 10-year-old to do a Google search. He must have a really lousy contract with his publishers.

What I find even more fascinating is the criticism that this film has received from people who have not even seen it. And these are not just run-of-the-mill whack jobs blogging in their mom's basement. Whether it's the countless slam jobs that the film encountered before it was even shown in private screenings or even respected journalists writing in respected journals two weeks after the film's release that they haven't seen it -- and then go on to blather against it for pages -- the main point of the movie gets reinforced over and over again. Here is an issue that (theoretically) intelligent people are disinclined to discuss at all.

3502377,5,B001BYLFFS,"It isn't surprising that so many Darwinian fundamentalist fanatics here attempt to debunk this film as lies and trash etc.

The funniest thing about that is, that in doing so, they are proving to the rest of us that the film's content is correct.

Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism for you nit-pickers) is the opium of the materialist/atheist with no ability to face his insecurities towards the evidence of design in the universe and the logical implications thereof.

In the words of atheist zoologist S.J. Gould, ""The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition. Either you accept the rules and attitudes and beliefs promulgated by the 'papacy' (for which read, perhaps, the Royal Society or the Royal College of Physicians), or face a dreadful retribution. We will not actually burn you at the stake, because that sanction, unhappily, is now no longer available under our milksop laws. But we will make damned sure that you are a dead duck in our trade."" (Gould, D.W., ""Letting poetry loose in the laboratory,"" New Scientist, 29 August 1992, p. 51)

The film shows that this is especially true where Darwinism is concerned. While Gould clearly admits the fact his followers strangely cannot.

Sir F. Hoyle saw the situation the same way, ""Because the old believers said that God came out of the sky, thereby connecting the Earth with events outside it, the new believers were obliged to say the opposite and to do so, as always, with intense conviction. Although the new believers had not a particle of evidence to support their statements on the matter, they asserted that the rabbit producing sludge (called soup to make it sound more palatable) was terrestrially located and that all chemical and biochemical transmogrifications of the sludge were terrestrially inspired. Because there was not a particle of evidence to support this view, new believers had to swallow it as an article of faith, otherwise they could not pass their examinations or secure a job or avoid the ridicule of their colleagues. So it came about from 1860 onward that new believers became in a sense mentally ill, or, more precisely, either you became mentally ill or you quitted the subject of biology, as I had done in my early teens. The trouble for young biologists was that, with everyone around them ill, it became impossible for them to think they were well unless they were ill, which again is a situation you can read all about in the columns of Nature."" (Hoyle, F., ""Mathematics of Evolution,"" [1987], Acorn Enterprises: Memphis TN, 1999, pp. 3-4).

Indeed, pass exams, secure a job and avoid ridicule.  All that we know is happening in current Western & European academia and that the film Expelled so easily and accurately demonstrates.  I would add, from my own experiences - the half has never yet been told.

While it places overdue scrutiny on the various cases of discrimination and blacklisting of ID proponents, it makes it's case with an even hand -- allowing the traditional Darwinists to express their hatred for God in their own terms. Examples include allowing PZ Myers to declare that religion be reduced to the role of knitting, and Richard Dawkins reading an excerpt from his book -- a lengthy excerpt using every adjective imaginable to denigrate the God of Muslims, Christians, and Jews. Faculty at Iowa State University, in their own words describe the fight to keep ""creationism"" out of their field, in their efforts to rid themselves of faculty that suggest support for ID.

Far from slick Michael-Moore, sleight-of-hand editing, we see first hand the motivation behind the animus to ID. This animus is continually demonstrated to be the response to an existential threat. Dr. John Polkinghorn, KBE FRS, makes a brief appearance, and this notable point in the movie -- that traditional Darwinists ultimately object to ID not on scientific grounds, but on metaphysical and existential grounds.

By the way, they just recently found the DNA coding for building bones, eyes and nerves comntained in the genomes of sea sponges....BUT, sponges don't have eyes, skeletons, or nerves.

Now, tell me again how life began as a simple uni-celled organism and grew more complex over eons of time through an undirected random purposeless process(?!). And, how exactly does that look when we repeatedly find that genetic complexity simply has NOTHING TO DO with morphilogiocal complexity?

And, why is it gain, that protazoan (uni-celled) animals would have and conserve the genetic toolkit for building complex metazoan (multi-celled) bodies?

  In ""Darwins Black Box"", Michael Behe explained that random mutations cannot account for biological systems that are irreducibly complex.  There is no survival benefit to these systems until all their parts are in place together.  They cannot be built up piece by piece. In his second book, ""The Edge of Evolution"", Behe wrote that he checked the scientific journals for refutations of this point.  There were none.

The complexity of life itself is one thing that strongly argues against the possibility of life simply arising spontaneously out of simple matter.

This movie is on target. I have been cutting out news paper articles about educators/professors who have been fired or let go because they fond, in there field, that evolution does not work. I have a nice collection.
Maybe you can explain how a four digit code like DNA (FYI we currently use two Digit in computers, 0's and 1's) was created by Mother Nature (good luck) or the first cell.  If you have ever done any computer programming you would know that randomly it's not possible, only by intelligence. There is a better chance a lightening striking a Junk yard and a 747 airplane is created randomly from heat and all.  Believe in that? You do, I guess, good luck with that.
Plus, none of the ""Icons of evolution"" stand reason anyway. Darwin's ""embryo theory"" has been disproved since the invention of elect-microscopes. And the others are just as false. Look into it. Plus,  have you been paying attention to current events,  ""Man is as old as Coal"", in Pennsylvania, in a coal vain they have found a human skull that is around 300 million years old (look it up on the internet, or last years news papers). So much for your monkey tree, you been lied to all these years. Then again, you may have evolved from ""monkeys"" but I didn't.
And lastly, logically, a world without god makes no sense. It would be to live and die with out purpose or reason. There is no ""good or evil"". We should just pleasure ourselves because all we have is this short life, and than there is nothing. Why follow rules, there are no consequences.
On your dying bed you will have only one hope, that god exists, you will see. Where are you going to be in a 120 years? Without hope, nowhere is the place. There are no atheists in the foxhole.
For myself, I have personal proof that god exists. It was certain events during and after my grandmother's death and also my birth and childhood. She, my grandmother, was the kindest and most gentle person I have ever known. I won't bore you with my story because it wouldn't change your mind anyway. ""Jesus"" with miracles could not change skeptic's minds, so what chance do I have.
The truth is elusive. Finding it in this life is not easy. Everybody has their own. To see truth in this world it takes wisdom and to acquire wisdom is not easy. You may be educated but that does not make you smart. Some people can read others like an open book and have very little education. They have some degree of wisdom. Life experience builds wisdom, but some don't listen and never learn.
So, be careful in what you believe in. Man kind is good at lying. You will never get the complete truth but some persons own truth. Everybody have their own agenda, they're motivated by their own values (goodness/greed/money/love/power, etc.) Just be wise, because the smartest man maybe the biggest fool of all.

As someone who is intimately acquainted with creationism and Intelligent design ( I used to be a creationist) I am familiar with the kind of deception  and fear tactics employed by creationists. Only in America, where nearly 50% of the electorate think the earth is 6000 years old could you market this movie. The American public is so scientifically illiterate it staggers the imagination (as demonstrated by recent national polls). This movie contains unbelievable BS throughout. Lies on top of lies with lie topping. It's filled with so many falsehoods it's scary.
There are websites utterly debunking this heap of nonsense all over the internet, so I won't get into it here. The Hitler nonsense was so absurd it was almost vomit inducing.
""Religion leads you to a glorious place, science leads you to killing people""-Ben Stein. What a moron!
Evolution is a FACT, supported by mountains of overwhelming evidence, from fossil and geological to biological to genetic. Read a friggin book people.

3502433,4,B001BYLFFS,"What is Ben Stein's beef?  In his documentary, ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"", you begin to realize from the opening shots at the Berlin Wall, that the main issue in the movie is freedom; freedom to pursue a line of thinking.

Anyone familiar with the literature of Intelligent Design knows that its proponents complain that it is misunderstood; that it's opponents do not attempt to consider it's arguments fairly and honestly; and that it is falsely mischaracterized in the media.

The false mischaracterization by the media is probably true since ID is already treated as a punch line on the late night talk shows and Saturday Night Live.

Of course, opponents of Intelligent Design will mock the complaints of ID proponents and assert that ID just, simply, does not qualify as real science.  They will suggest that it is not a line of thinking that should be pursued because it is not worth pursuing.

That's where the idea of freedom comes in.  Stein asserts that the freedom to follow these thoughts should be allowed, even if you don't like the implications of the thoughts.  In human history there have always been those--and there always will be those--who are all the more motivated to investigate ideas when they have been told that they are not allowed to do so.

""Expelled"" introduces audiences to some of the people in the academic world who made the mistake of merely throwing the idea of ID on the table for discussion and were punished for doing so.  One of the more well known of these persons is Richard von Sternberg who is a biologist with two PhDs and was working, at the time, for the Smithsonian Institute.  The irony is that von Sternberg, as an evolutionary biologist wasn't even promoting Intelligent Design, but as the editor of a journal called the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, he merely allowed a peer reviewed paper by, credentialed scientist, Stephen Meyers to be published in the journal.

The article in question cast doubt on whether Darwinian evolution can truly explain the monumental question of genetic information--it's a pretty interesting argument, by the way, for anyone who is willing to give it honest consideration--and goes on to suggest that, perhaps, some type of intelligence had to have played a role.  Since intelligence can be strongly and persuasively argued to be a necessary requirement for the presence of ""information"" and since intelligence has even been put forth as an explanation by evolutionists in the form of the ""panspermia hypothesis"" it does not seem like the suggestion of intelligent causation should have been that upsetting of a thought.  However, von Sternberg was fired for allowing such a frightening concept to be published in the journal.

Shouldn't a scientist, be allowed to suggest a hypothesis, even what someone might consider to be an outlandish hypothesis?  Sometimes it is the hypothesis that is least expected that turns out to be true.  This represents the issue of freedom that Stein is raising with his film.

""Expelled"" looks at ID's fight in the academic world, in the media, and even in the courts.  One of the salient points the movie makes is that science questions should not be determined in courtrooms.  Of course, this will lead to a very robust discussion of ""what constitutes science?"" and ""what are proper scientific pursuits?"" and ""who gets to decide what science is, then?""  If you read philosophers of science, you discover that the answer to those questions are not as simple and obvious as you might expect.  But it does seem reasonable to say that the answers to those questions should not be determined by a court of law.

A side note?  Scientists, believe it or not, are not the best equipped to answer the question ""what is science?""  That is a philosophical question which most scientists are, actually, not trained to answer.  It is a question that is studied and answered best by philosophers of science.

Although ""Expelled"" presents comments from scientists who oppose Intelligent Design, it is fair to say that it is defending one side of an argument.  But since it is the side of the argument that is shut down by those who are supposed to be fair and impartial and free-thinking and open to debate, it's the side of the argument that deserves to be heard.

3502434,5,B001BYLFFS,"There are two sides to every story, and Expelled takes its audience on a very serious journey where so called empirical evidence actually raises more doubt in the scientific community than Intelligent Design or Creation platforms. This is on of the best modern films that offers the best apologetic in terms of evidence for Intelligent Design. How can one be truly educated if he or she cannot be free to examine all evidence for their own benefit and share that evidence with others? Should we all be expelled from school just for modeling academic freedom?

As for the main character, Ben Stein, I raise my glass to him for showing that smart people can have a sense of humor and that you don't need a Ph. D to understand that wrong is wrong, don't force something to be right. The scientific community, for many years, has set Evolution up as the default answer,...the joke is on them!

The scientists who are questioning Darwinian evolution are SMART, not just mind-numbed robotons who repeat what some in the scientific community have (mindlessly) repeated for years.  You can not look at all the disparities in the evolutionary theory and not question it.  There are too many unanswered, untestable, unobservable issues to just accept it.

3502465,5,B001BYLFFS,"There are times, in science, when a threshold is reached that opens many more vistas than previously known.  A new realm of ignorance is discovered.  The truly unbiased mind may become a tortured one. The discovery of new, greater complexity in the realm of the living cell, as Stein's film points out is new information, not something available to Darwin.  So, what is going on?  The fact that Biblical parallels can be drawn to connect molecular complexity to the Creation story excites many who say, ""ah ha, we were right all along"".  This is not scientific.  But nor is the simple fact that Darwin lived without this information and that his ideas are all sacred.  Two religions, as evidenced by the polarization of the reviews for Stein's film, are arguing against each other over nothing but new information. Stein's movie, therefore, is extremely uncomfortable to the comfortable.  Intelligent Design is merely one hypothesis concerning new information that may undermine Darwin's Origin of Species -- a threat indeed.  But true science does not rule out coherent hypotheses by adhering to dogmatic norms-- it reconsiders.  To reconsider may even involve starting over.  For example, the very idea of a single point of creation of the entire universe in the distant past was once considered a mythical, silly religious point of view from Biblical Creationists and other cults.  Since the mid-60s or so, it has now become a fundamental tenet of Physics.  Creation is now Physics.  Why, therefore, should we ignore the very mysterious sense of wonder that appeals to the child in us when we encounter new experiences? Can we include rational intelligence and purpose into the mysterious workings of all things?  How is science itself any different?",1222300800,18,1753,5.080419580419581

If anyone actually watched Expelled, they'd see that it's not ""thinly disguised creationism"" but rather about the freedom to challenge entrenched views. Certain sectors are always taking the church to task for supposedly limiting Galileo's freedom of inquiry and speech (in a vastly distorted account of what actually happened). Hello! Exactly the same thing is happening now, although they seem rather more silent when the shoe is on the other foot. Ben Stein is merely trying to restore the freedoms of speech and inquiry guaranteed in the US constitution to the realm of academia and the hugely controlled ""Big Science"" of public science foundations and those funded by philanthropic grants, including the Smithsonian Institute, National academy of Science, and the National Science Foundation.

After seeing Expelled in a theater, I wrote a long review of it elsewhere on the web. Now I see it's sparked a rather lively debate among reviewers. Actually, among those who, by their own admission, haven't seen it. One reviewer asks why people are voting against his review (which is against the film). Probably for the same reason people are voting against my review of Dawkins' book: not because the review is ""not helpful"" but as a way of voting for or against the book or film, as it were.

Having said that, it's probably as impossible to be neutral about this film as about Michael Moore's Farenheit 911 or an Oliver Stone fictionmentary. In my view, however, it's a fine piece of film making. Witty, irreverent, inventive, thoughtful, and Ben Stein is at his likeable, deadpan best. A friend I watched it with said just the opening titles were better than most films he'd seen recently, and I'm inclined to agree. If this film had had the opposite message, I think it would be getting an Academy Award and the New York Times wouldn't stop raving about it (instead of at it).

That's all well and good, one may be saying, but you haven't said anything about the subject. No, and I'd really rather not. If you hold a view generally called these days ""Neo-Darwinism"" you probably still will after seeing the film. If you incline to an idea called ""Intelligent Design"", you'll still incline so. If you're interested in battles between factions of the Academy in universities, however, or in free speech and press versus censorship (and this would likely be the topic of many reviews if this film had a different viewpoint), here's an engaging look at the salvos flying back and forth in a social and intellectual debate that much of the media have to date declined to cover.

One interesting thing came out of this film, and that was a test case for ""fair use"" in relation to copyright laws, an idea everybody knows about, but which seems generally undefined. It concerned Yoko's suing Ben Stein and the producers for using a snippet of John Lennon's song ""Imagine"". Hasn't everyone and their dog used that song? Yes, but here it wasn't used to sell tennis shoes, but to be considered critically. Again, if the film had the opposite viewpoint, I don't think there would have been a suit, but the outcome was to define ""fair use"" in its original intent, so that common Joes and Janes don't have to fear cadres of corporate lawyers merely for referring to copyrighted songs, books, films and other materials.

As the film shows, the use of Darwin's ideas to support Nazi ideology and eugenics was almost universal during and following the Victorian era, and was generally known as ""social Darwinism"". One may argue that these were actually Huxley's ideas, or that Darwin borrowed heavily from Alfred Wallace, but whatever their pedigree, they were pressed into service nearly at once. G.K. Chesterton wrote tirelessly against the Nazis as they were beginning to come to power, attempting to expose their plan of eugenics. In reference to another reviewer, I have read Mein Kampf (sp.) also, and Hitler's plan was entirely based on ""social Darwinism"". So were the ideas of Margaret Sanger and numerous other crusaders for what was known as ""scientific planning"". Numerous authors have pointed out the racist motivations behind the Royal Society in Britain and the ages of Victorian and Edwardian exploration, in which races were contrasted in elaborate displays during the world expositions and fairs.

This was also the motivation in the Soviet Union, which forced a famine in order to coerce farmers onto state cooperatives. When Malcolm Muggeridge exposed this plan in the 'thirties, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chronicles-of-Wasted-Time/dp/1573833762/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chronicles of Wasted Time</a>&nbsp;he was widely denounced by Soviet supporters in the media who wanted this experiment in social planning to succeed. Among these were the Fabian Socialists, Sydney and Beatrice Webb. But Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary in 1933: ""(There was) another account of the famine in Russia in the Manchester Guardian (a British newspaper), which certainly bears out Malcolm's reports....Fortunately for the USSR, the attention of the capitalist countries is today concentrated on the Mad Dog of Europe-- Hitler's Germany.""

This film may induce a sense of vertigo, being chocabloc full of information and history barely referenced in the media. The effect may be akin to sailing in a calm sea, only to find one has unaccountably hit an iceberg. Or rather the tip of an iceberg, and the film may spark curious viewers to explore the vast reaches submerged below.

The problem is that there are two camps and the Darwinists are afraid to even think about the possibility of an intelligent designer.  The evidence for macro evolution is not clear and, in fact, is almost non existent.  The problem is that evolution is taught as fact, not as a theory.  How often do you hear about evolution instead of the theory of evolution?  It is a theory, and not a good one at that!  Evolution cannot explain how single cell organisms came into being.  They can't explain the quantum leap from single cell to multi-cell life forms.  They can't explain the existence of irreducibly complex systems in an organism.  As was mentioned in the movie, questions that are not answered adequately have a way of coming up again.

In closing let me say, if you hate this movie I'm willing to bet that your world view doesn't include God.  If you like this movie your world view most certainly includes God.  If you are an atheist and don't want to be challenged to think that their might, just might be a God, then please do not see this movie.  I wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.",1221523200,19,1546,4.5234657039711195

Rate this movie down as much as you can just so that people have no choice but to believe what you do. And you claim that Christians are close minded.

3502486,1,B001BYLFFS,"Every animal that produces milk has four limbs and no feathers. Creatures with feathers lay eggs and have beaks but no teeth. It doesn't have to be this way, but it is.

Such patterns of similarities and differences among animals were apparent to 18th century naturalists, and they were organized into a system of classification by Carl Linnaeus (a creationist). The classification system revealed a pattern of groups within groups that is today called a nested hierarchy. For example, humans are apes, which are mammals, which are vertebrates, which are eukaryotes (skipping a few levels).

An interesting facet of the nested hierarchy of life is that you get the same pattern of groups within groups irrespective of which feature you use to perform the classification. This is not true of designed objects -- you can arrange shoes or toasters into a nested hierarchy, but you'll get a different pattern if you pick different features (color, price, etc.).

Darwin's big contribution was to point out that the nested hierarchy of life was consistent with common descent, but not with special creation. He also suggested that natural selection acting on some source of variation could account for many of the features of extant species, and he backed this idea up with lots of data from his own observations and those of others.

Both of Darwin's big ideas (common descent and natural selection) have been tested literally millions of times in the last 150 years, and they have turned out to be true. By that I mean that they account well for the observations that have been made, and they do a good job of predicting what will be found in the future. For example, when it became possible to sequence the genomes of different organisms, it came as no surprise to anyone that snippets of DNA from different animals formed a nested hierarchy, that it was the same nested hierarchy obtained from morphology, and that it was the same no matter which snippet was chosen as the basis for the analysis. This is exactly what evolutionary theory predicts, and no one has ever been able to come up with a better explanation. Indeed there hasn't been a scientific debate about common descent for many decades.

When I say ""scientific debate"", I don't mean to imply that no one with scientific credentials has ever questioned common descent. In fact this happens occasionally, but in all cases the questioner has a non-scientific motive, and that motive is almost always religious. No one has published actual (peer-reviewed) research that refutes the basic principles of evolution, even though there is a pile of Nobel Prizes waiting for anyone who can do so.

All of this drives creationists nuts, and so they have tried various non-scientific methods of keeping people from learning about evolution. The most direct strategy has been to co-opt the public school system, first by banning the teaching of evolution, then insisting on teaching both creationism and evolution, then trying to get Intelligent Design into schools, and most recently promoting a ""critical analysis"" of evolution. All of these approaches are patently illegal, as they violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.

More recent efforts have focused on blogging, writing bad pop-science books, and getting people with doctoral degrees to sign a petition saying they are skeptical of evolution. This last one is just sad (I mean, Darwin was skeptical of evolution, as in fact every scientist is skeptical of everything. Why not get people to sign a petition saying that Intelligent Design is needed to explain some feature of the data? I think I know the answer to that one). Note that none of these activities can be described as scientific research.

Evolution is an extremely useful description of the way the world works. If Darwin hadn't discovered it, someone else would have (in fact Wallace pretty much did). So even if the Nazis did get their ideas from Darwin (and there's absolutely no evidence that they did), what does it matter? Do you really think that an idea should be evaluated based on how crazy people interpret it? Religious people, does this make sense to you?",1221350400,49,4740,5.137483787289235

Yes, those are two hypotheses that the ""minds"" behind the hypothesis of evolution actually believe in.  THEY ADMIT IT ON THE FILM!  THIS IS WHY THIS FILM IS SO HATED WITH A BROODING AND BOILING PURPLE PASSION!  Stein allows the evolutionists to spew forth their own stupidity in their own words, phrasing and parsing.  There is nothing taken from context and the conclusions absolutely expose the hypothesis of evolution as a sham whose underlings ought be humiliated by their own flamboyant and obvious double-standards when it comes to what SCIENCE is verus what RELIGION is.

Point blank, evolutionists are easily shown to be RELIGIOUS ONLY and base their ""findings"" on what they want to find and in so doing create an infrastructure within ""scientific academia"" on which none of the ""experts"" can even agree on.  The entire ""infrastructure"" is incomplete and when said ""infrastructure"" is examined, it throws these clowns into FITS!  Watch the dvd, decide for yourself who is being honest and who is trying to control people.  Then do some research for yourself.

3502518,3,B001BYLFFS,"This film is interesting in the fact that I think its social effect in our culture is, on one level, more fascinating than the film itself. People praise the documentaries they love and align with their own presuppositions and preconceived notions on subject, A, B, C. Documentaries, in my honest opinion, are more a form of modern visual rhetoric than they are a catalogue of facts. This is a fundamental and necessary point for viewing and understanding documentaries and media in our culture today. Where in the Greek culture, rhetoric took place in the physical marketplace, today's arena of rhetoric is film and media. The film of course has an argument(i.e. a proposition sustained by evidence and deduction, which you may debate the evidence, premises, and deductions, but one cannot take away the fact that the film it is an argument). I think this film, among others points to the fact that documentaries, and movies in general have become a stimulus and vehicle in our culture at broad for the relay and discussion of ideologies.

The main benefit of this film, is that Expelled begins to look at the logical implications of  a theory of origins. That is, ideas have consequences. We cannot play this game of disconnecting science from all other disciplines. Science does not occur in a vacuum on independent evidence and attestation. In addition,  If a scientific principal is true, it is not just scientific truth, it is also social, economic, historical truth. Questions of epistemology need to be answered. How does one know we know, what is sufficient evidence to prove or disprove. Science, like any other discipline is just as much philosophically based as is any other discipline. If claim or idea ""A"" is indeed true,  then the logical implications need to be understood. Reality is reality.  One cannot claim evolution, ID, or creation to be true and then not accept the logical, moral, ethical, sociological, economical, religious, political,  and historical implications that follow. One cannot have his or her cake and eat it to.  There are essentially four main questions to the human existence - origin, meaning, morality, and destiny.

At its core the movie is about the change in science from being a discipline that allowed different possibilities to be discussed to one that now punishes dissenting views if they are outside of accepted parameters -- in this case, the correctness of evolution as a solely naturalistic process.  Those who allow themselves to admit that Intelligent Design could have happened are removed from their teaching positions.  The choice is clear: tow the line, or risk losing your job.

I was able to attend the prescreening in Minneapolis where Richard Dawkins and his wife attended and where P.Z. Myers was denied.  I sat right behind Mr. Myers family. I also attended a second time at a public showing in Eden Prairie, MN.  The point made in this movie is real.  There is a concentrated effort to resist and not permit anything that refers to God within the field of science.  I am a Life Science teacher within the public school system and it is quite apparent that evolution is the only explanation of how life began and how life has diversified that is allowed to be presented within most public schools, colleges and universities.  What amazes me are the comments made by evolutionists that state that this is a fact.  Evolution is an unproven model.  There is no repeatable or empirical evidence that can be demonstrated that shows that any species has changed from one form to another, let alone life coming from non-life. Granted that those who accept a model of intelligent design face the same dilemma, there is no way to prove or repeat the process of creation.  That being said, there is still a growing amount of observations that would support the model of intelligent design and a relatively young earth that is not even given the light of day as far as argument or discussion is concerned within the ""academic world"".  This movie chose a unique way of highlighting this issue.  I have been teaching biology and life science now for over 30 years and the more I look into the many specific areas of ""theory"" of evolution, the more difficulties I see in accepting these statements, especially now that they are being presented as fact.  What is a theory?  What is a fact?  What is science for that matter?

3502564,5,B001BYLFFS,"It is so funny how people are so afraid to learn and accept anything outside of what ""science"" has ""proven""  the funniest part is that Evolution and the big bang theory have all been scientifically disproven and because schools still teach it (out of convenience), people cling to it as a safety net...  Get a clue, seriously!!

As the genius before me put it, there is a line dividing people who believe in creationism and evolution.  People often get into fist fights because of this.  But, to state that Ben Stien is a hypocrite because of this movie is so ridiculous!  He is getting to the bottom of it, and with a motive of truth.  He isn't trying to destroy anyone or anything.  But he maybe have a little ""wake up and smell the coffee"" aspect of this topic.

We saw this same thing when Al Gore who, if we all remember, ""created the internet"" <<what a tool<< made is documentary about global warming and scared kids all over the place.  Good job motivating people to take care of the society, but cut the crap.  Scientists have been saying the world is coming to an end because of global warming since before my mom was born.  As long as liberals have some crisis to believe in like Y2K and global warming, the world can keep going.  But, the point is, I don't see all of them blowing up about it.  If there was something scientifically disproving global warming, they would be in an uproar about it because the school and Al Gore teaches them otherwise..  give me a break.

""The Wedge Strategy"" and ""Kitzmiller vs Dover"" You will see clearly the religious motivation behind this DVD. It is all part of the Discovery Institute's plan to flood the popular media with its religious views since it has never produced any scentific support for Intelligent Design. Most disturbing is the misuse of Holocaust imagery that will only do damage not prove their cause.

There are more than just Darwinists out there with bad opinions about ""Expelled""

Here is a review comment about ""Expelled"" from Wikipedia:

""The general media response to the film has been largely unfavorable. It received an 8% meta-score from Rotten Tomatoes. Multiple reviews, including those of USA Today and Scientific American, have described the film as propaganda.[11][12][13] The Chicago Tribune's rating was ""1 star (poor),""[14] while the New York Times described it as ""a conspiracy-theory rant masquerading as investigative inquiry"" and ""an unprincipled propaganda piece that insults believers and nonbelievers alike.""[12] One of the few positive reviews appeared in Christianity Today.[15]""

The Discovery Institute even has one of their own people, William Dembski, reviewing and trying to promote this DVD in a comment below. Dembski is one of the main fellows at the Discovery Institute. He was supposed to testify at the Dover vs Kitzmiller trial but backed out to avoid being skewered by cross examination. He has publicly stated several times wanting to put Darwinism on trial but when he got his chance he chickened out. In that trial the fact came out that he so far has no peer reviewed articles or books to his name yet he is one of the leading proponents of ID.

For those giving high reviews at least read a little of the history of the ID movement from other sources. Only the uninformed will take this DVD seriously.",1219017600,5,1988,5.0672782874617734

Its claim to be a serious treatment of the evolution issue is absurd. Ben Stein is obnoxious, boring, and melodramatic. His weepy act at the concentration camp was just offensive. As if it does some sort of justice to the victims of genocide to lay the blame at the feet of a scientific theory with unfounded assumptions and baseless associations. Please do not further this ridiculous cause by buying the DVD. It is not an elegant presentation of one side of a vigorous debate. It is a silly, unspohisticated romp through nonsense that debases the debate itself. Stein's interview with Richard Dawkins was probably the pinnacle of ridiculousness in this waste of time. In his efforts to try and make Dawkins look silly, Stein comes off looking, quite frankly, like an idiot. While I don't particluarly care about Dawkins one way or the other, I don't think the debate desreves the ignorant mudslinging hack treatment that Stein gives it.

The film does accomplish one thing. It ultimately becomes a propoganda film for its cause, much like the Nazi propoganda it associated with evolution. This film could be dangerous if its simplistic arguments and baseless hollow accusations are persuasive. I don't believe it will.

3502567,5,B001BYLFFS,"I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.  I saw it because several people I know who always claim to be open minded and thoughtful totally bashed it.

I had to see it then...  Seeing all these reviews which appear to be nothing but second grader rants totally supports my theory that whenever anyone does anything of consequence the ""authorities"" start acting like children having a tantrum or run away and cover their eyes, ears and mouth.

Just for doing the movie in this hostile environment it gets five stars from me.

If for no other reason you should watch this movie for the interview with the author of ""The Blind Watchmaker.""

Mr. Stein simply asks questions and the answers are precious, sad, but precious.

I loved the interview because it exemplifies the argument Stein is making through the whole movie. Stein does not hit you over the head with it either--he lets you see it for yourself.

The movie presents the fundamental argument: That Scientists should be open to follow the evidence where ever it leads however uncomfortable.  He also presents a powerful information concerning what can happen to individual human rights when those in power pick up on a novel idea and run with it...

Stein shows, throughout the movie, science is impotent when scientists try to force a belief system paradigm into their thinking.  The paradigm or ""wall"" of interest is that there is no place for religion in science therefore there can be no creator and no means to understand the origins of life other than through random happenstance (but apparently its OK to consider ""little green men."")

Clarified by this movie and the rantings (I mean reviews), people don't like to question what their teachers and TV told them ad nausea all their lives.  It is uncomfortable and it takes intestinal fortitude many folks simply lack and would rather just be with the safe crowd and make them selves feel better by suckling on the teat of rage; scream down Mr. Stein, ""liar liar liar...""

The movie supplies evidence origins of life cannot be explained by random events and Darwinism as it is understood even today, can be deadly for the citizenry from those in power who wield science like a bat.  You may be thinking we are older wiser now, but then there is Al Gore...

Science is supposed to be the continued practice of ever increasing knowledge and debate without prejudice.  Stein shows in interview after interview with the self proclaimed ""open minded"" there is little else but close minded prejudice within the halls of many academic institutions where Darwin and neo-Darwinism is concerned.

To them, the ""debate is over.""

If you've taken any time to read some of the movie reviews you can see this self evident arrogant antagonism unleashed.

It is very surprising to see the interviews with several prominent academics dismiss without consideration ideas which confront this belief system; so called scientists and academics reduced to name calling.

Its just sad.

What is sadder still is watching one of them later talk about experiments to determine if there is a ""blueprint"" in DNA...  Just think on that one for a moment.

Stein walks you through several illustrative events; personal experiences of scientists--real scientists who are and have been studying Biology and Microbiology.  And as a result of relatively modest ideas:  Like the novel idea that life did not randomly start on this planet.  That the complexity we see in a single cell cannot be explained by random mutations...

The result of these statements or proposals gets these men and women ""let go"" or ridiculed or not given tenure, treated like many of the persons reviewing this movie treat the movie.  Not with arguments, not with facts but simply calling Ben Stein a liar then lying themselves.

Stein walks us through what the Darwinist ideology brought through the power of the state.  About 30 US states and their effort to rid us of the undesirable species.  About Margret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and of course we learn about Germany and its efforts for the ""Arian"" race and of course where those ideas came from.

I was very disturbed by the discussion about the US governments efforts to sterilize folks.  Some of these folks are alive today-just disturbing.

Then Stein takes you to a real museum in Germany (it exists today and is not a lie) which shows what happens when you follow the thinking thread of ""survival of the fittest"" and meld that with unyielding belief in an ideology.

Surprisingly, the most disturbing, shameful and deadly behaviors were not from those evil Christians...",1218931200,586,4588,4.920676202860858

Both creationism and evolution require faith.  The first requires faith in an all-powerful, all-knowing, miracle-working God.  The second requires faith that, without such a God, chance or accident can combined chemicals in a random, incalculable way and formed everything we see today.  No one was around when one or the other happened, but for some reason; perhaps because it means there is no master to answer to, the godless theory is the superior one.

I'll admit that some topics are played up for the sake of the camera (e.g., Darwin, while correctly quoted, would have benefited from the surrounding sentences within which the cited quotes were found.)

However, the movie brings out many important points related to the dogmatic acceptance of evolution.  Evolution in little steps, is very well supported.  However, saying that evolution clearly has demonstrated the genetic pathways necessary for all life to have originated from one initial cell is not yet corroborated in theory, labs, or the field.

A decade ago science said the slowing universe expansion was a 'fact', and yet today we've learned that the universe expansion is doing the complete opposite, speeding up.

The foundation of science is putting theories to the test and seeing if they hold up.  The scrutiny of evolutionary theory can only help by either:

1) Providing more corroborating evidence and strengthening the theory.

- or -

2) Providing a better theory.

Science benefits from both outcomes, just as the movie suggests.",1218672000,27,1116,5.17877094972067

There's a large difference between British and American culture; the US suffers very badly from a serious and unhealthy case of deep-set right-wing religious fervor in many areas, which causes a serious negative drag effect on the advancement of scientific discovery.

As a result of this, many of the fundamentalist agencies have attempted to coerce through deception and outright lies in order to bolster their political strength. One such instance is the invention of a new scientific 'theory' called Intelligent Design. Unlike any other theory, this one simply does not hold up to peer review, has no creditable sources or hard evidence, and is in reality nothing more than creationism in disguise.

This film is an attempt by such fundamentalist agencies to force an idea (not a theory- in scientific terminology, a theory requires corroboration and backup evidence. This is just an idea, the idea of creationism in a new suit) into a school setting. I sat through this film, and if I had began to take a drink of whiskey every time I found a false analogy, outright lie or so on, I'd have been in an alcohol induced coma within the first half hour.

It wasn't setting out to prove ID as many reviewers claim, reviewers that are clearly insecure about their own beliefs to have missed such a blatantly clear and perfectly proved premise.

Evolutionism is indefensible from a physical/chemical standpoint.  Only a biologist with no formal p-chem/physics background could possibly postulate that Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine or Thymine could appear randomly, coalesce spontaneously to form a DNA strand, have a lipid barrier suddenly appear around it to form a nucleus and thereby create a single celled animal from nothing.  No part of that tenant of evolution is possible and even the current proponents of evolution aren't so unwise as to claim that it is.  And, for the Hollywood types, no it's not possible even if lightning strikes nearby (this is the usual mechanism screen writers use to make machines think, dead to rise and any other miracle-needed-here situation in their vacant ""prose"").

The question is why are these people under attack if the scientific community is truly interested in open dialogue?  The reality is: most people are willing to believe evolution, something they don't truly understand or even endeavor to, simply because it affirms their lifestyle.  If there ever was an opiate for the masses, it would be evolution.

When a person in a lab coat proclaims evolution as the explanation for the creation of life, and someone who might know basic chemistry but no more, believes it (takes it on faith), no one balks or criticizes.  That theory says we can do what we want as long as we don't get caught.  Why wouldn't they latch on to such a self-justifying description of life?

What this movie also clearly shows is the result of an entire society following that premise: we're just animals trying to protect our patch of grass and then we're gone.  It is a very well put together and well researched film.  It gives evolutionists the chance that they don't afford those in the scientific community who don't take their formulation on faith: a forum to propose their beliefs.  Go see this great film.

That's why the ""argument from design"" has been around for thousands of years.  Rejuvenating scientific evidence has been discovered recently.  The fine tuning of the physical constants of the universe and a stunning complexity in the molecular machinery in living cells.  Darwin knew none of this and, indeed, no one else did either until the past few decades.  Mud-to-man evolution by a blind trial and error mechanism (neo-Darwinian hypothesis - Dawkins' ""blind watchmaker"") is in deep trouble and getting deeper with every relevant new discovery.

The black-balling of scientists depicted in the movie is real and is worth watching for that alone.

I found a couple of things objectionable, most notably the holocaust footage.  I think this was a serious and unnecessary distraction from the main message - the black-balling of scientists who don't faithfully accept the notion that the universe and the life it contains is a fortuitous (for us) accident resulting from a random dance of atoms.

The linkage of Darwin's theory to the holocaust is a matter of great contention and I don't believe for a nanosecond it was, as Berlinski states, ""a necessary factor"".  When one group of people decides they want to eliminate another group of people they'll rationalize it by whatever  expedient method works.  The movie doesn't tell you that Nazi eugenics laws were initially modeled after American eugenics laws nor does it tell you that racial/ethic purity laws have been around long before Darwin came along.  It doesn't tell you that mainstream Christian churches in the United States were proponents of eugenics laws. Many of the states in the US, beginning in the 1600's before they even were states, and persisting through the early 20th century, had laws prohibiting the marriage of blacks and whites.  Darwin's theory wasn't part of the eugenics logic in the 1600's or any time since then.  The logic is entirely derived from animal husbandry - you breed your most desirable animals together and discard the rest.  That's ancient knowledge.  Darwin contributed nothing new in that regard.  Darwin's claim to fame was in  asserting that artificial selection (animal husbandry) had a corollary in the wild he called ""natural selection"" and that natural selection operating over millions of years led to new species being formed.  That's the extent of Darwin's contribution to science.  The rest of his ramblings are at best historical footnotes.

The other thing I didn't like was Stein's repeated mention of ""God"" as the purported intelligent design agency.  I will readily admit that the  vast majority of intelligent design proponents are heavily influenced by  their religious beliefs.  However, there are some like me who are not.  I'm an accomplished engineer who actually designs complex machines for a  living and I'm agnostic (I have no theistic or atheistic beliefs).  I simply know what it takes to design complex machines and I know the limits of what trial and error can accomplish.  Just because something is physically possible (mud-to-man evolution by accident IS physically possible) doesn't make it practically possible.  It's physically possible for a volcano to throw out a glob of molten gold that solidifies into a Swiss watch with the correct time on it.  It's just that the odds against that happening in a  finite universe are so overwhelming we consider it practically impossible. The reason it's practically impossible is that the number of permutations of the gob of molten gold that are not Swiss watches are trillions of trillions times greater in number than arrangements which are Swiss watches.  Yet Swiss watches actually exist.  Lots of them.  How?  By design.  The hallmark of intelligent agency is the ability to influence matter and energy such that practically impossible events actually happen.  So while I find compelling evidence of design in the universe that same evidence doesn't compel a belief in the God of Abraham or any other religious figurehead.  It compels a belief in *something* intelligent but it compels no specific belief.

At any rate I should get to the reason why I titled this review ""We're smarter than you..."".  The producers of Expelled anonymously produced and  put on YouTube the following video titled ""Beware the Believers"":

[...]

It's hilarious and free.  Watch it.  The scientific community, upon seeing this, largely thought it was a ""pro-science"" lampoon of creationists. In fact, after Expelled was released in theaters, the producers revealed themselves as the people who produced Expelled and got a great laugh out of it at the expense of the scientific community who thought it couldn't possibly be a ""creationist"" production.  They revealed themselves in this later video (also hilarious):

[...]

Scientists in academia supporting neo-Darwinian evolution think they're all smarter than the rest of us so if anyone disagrees with them they say, as Richard Dawkins most famously stated:

""It is absolutely safe to say that if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).""  from ""Put Your Money on Evolution""  The New York Times  (April 9, 1989)  section VII  p. 35

Yeah right.  If these scientists are so smart why are they sequestered in universities earning less than a typical plumber?  Most of the really smart scientists are employed by corporations and are earning 6 figure incomes and they don't run around wasting their time trying to turn Charles Darwin into some sort of savior.  If evolutionary theory is so compelling why do they resort to court orders to prevent criticism of it in public schools?  The truth is it can't stand up to criticism.  They know it, I know it, and if you study the issues with an open mind you'll know it too.

One last thing I'd like to say in closing is that intelligent design DOES NOT dispute common descent.  The idea that all life on our planet began from one or a few common ancestors billions of years ago is neither supported nor disputed by intelligent design.  ""Evolution"" proponents try to conflate evolution by random mutation and natural selection with common descent.  That is a red herring.  The intelligent design hypothesis disputes only the assertion that the origin and diversification of life was solely a result of random interactions of law and chance.  Intelligent design asserts that some of the things we find in living things, and the universe at large, are practically impossible without intelligent forethought.",1217548800,25,6953,5.091150442477876

It merely replicates itself.

Applying the ideas of morality to any non-thinking item is pointless. Humans are the only animals that are capable of even considering the issue. Evolution is seen in all animals, whether self aware or not, and is also seen in plant life.

I was really hoping to see an explanation of life different from evolution, with proper peer reviewed evidence: such a thing would turn the world up side down. However all I saw was yet another attempt to discredit over 100 years of peer reviewed work that started with Darwin.

3502697,1,B001BYLFFS,"As unforgivable and atrocious as Mr. Stein's butchering of the scientific establishment was, it does give great insight into the misunderstandings and intellectual shortcomings of people in his league. I had often wondered, how can it be that these people are so defiant in their endeavors. How can people posit such a horrible argument publicly and with pride? Is it an act of ignorance? Is it a willful subversion of truth for benefit of an agenda? Can it be both?

First of all, it's important to recognise this argument for what it is. This isn't the typical hopeless debate of trying to prove and disprove the existence of god or a higher power. It's a debate about the scientific standing of what is explicitly not scientific. Here we go...

Communication is far more than words, it's where the conversation has been, where it's going, and all the connotative subtleties that might be taken for granted by the professor but not just overlooked by the audience, but twisted and misunderstood. Lets say one person asks another, ""Where do you think humans come from?"" and the other says, ""Well I don't know for certain, but most investigation's observations are explained with a theory of evolution."", to which the original inquirer retorts, ""I think it's silly believe that an ape gave birth to a man."" At this point something very strange and very subtle occurs that changes the very nature of the conversation and usually without anyone taking notice. The naturalist is now tasked with correcting this misconception. They have to explain and correct this common misconception because they understand it is not actually a valid criticism of evolutionary theory, but a manifestation of ignorance. Undoubtedly, the inquisitor will see such contention to be just as dogmatic as their own fantastic religious indoctrinations and in light of this will place the two on equal standing. What I'm suggesting is, the moment two people of unequaled understandings clash the fact that the naturalist isn't trying to posit the theory of evolution as dogmatic truth of the universe (like religious creation) is lost in the background noise. The creationist doesn't understand this distinction because they don't understand the nature of scientific discovery, they are used to dogmatic answers for these questions.

It is this very misguided but innocent perception that causes people like Ben Stein to see evolution and ID as interchangeable and of equal intellectual standing. I think it is this confusion that Ben Stein bases his entire three ring circus on. He doesn't have any conceptual understanding of science and is therefor unaware of Intelligent Design's irrelevance to science. Scientists don't have to be atheists but science certainly is. Supernatural stories (and I refuse to use the word theory since ID is not a theory in the scientific sense) can not be tested and are therefor excluded as irrelevant to science, not by dogmatic authority, but by the their default failure within the scientific method. This isn't the consious act of angry atheists dominating scientific debate, but the understanding of science, common to scientists around the world regardless of their personal philosophies.

I suggest the only way to avoid this is to be humble. Everyone, by default, knows nothing of theory of evolution, or even science in general. We all must learn about it. So, I wouldn't beg the question, ""Why is it that 50% of American's don't accept the theory of evolution?"" The more impending one would be, ""Why do 50% of Americans think they are familiar enough with the theory to have an opinion of it?"" or, ""Why do people feel as if they must make a decision about something they don't know anything about?"" When I was younger and I was exploring the world for truth on these issues (as I continue to do) I did what none of the Expelled crew seemed to do, and more importantly what they forgot to tell their audience to do. I researched the material. I read about evolution in many different places and from the perspective of many academic and philosophical disciplines.

I came upon this realization while watching a TED talk of Daniel Dennett's. An incredible philosopher, he talks of our extremely defensive nature when it comes to suggesting that consciousness might not be what you think it is. You would take offense if one were to suggest that the world is not as you perceive it. After all isn't it suggesting insanity in so many words? But, we are all guilty of cognitive dissonance in one way or another. In fact it seems like a rather necessary function of our ontology. We know atoms are made up of mostly empty space yet we need to continue with our earthly models of solids, liquids, and gases, but those are just a sampling of reality. The most dense rock or crystal you can imagine is in actuality mostly empty space. So you see, cognitive dissonance is nothing to be ashamed of, but instead an extremely powerful thing to be aware of and that is my contention.

It's very important to always ask questions. Not only, ""Why does that happen?"" but ""How does this happen?"" and its ancillary ""How do I know this is happening?"" Once we're aware then we can evaluate just how much of our life is cognitively dissonant and most importantly evaluate whether this dissonance is a hindrance or a necessity. In my eyes, this is essentially the disposition of what I'd like the word atheist to mean, or at least what I stand for. For it's this awareness by which I shave god from my ontology with Occam's Razor.

Up until this point I've been giving Mr. Stein the benefit of the doubt. I can now understand how someone of Ben's calibre could be stuck on such a ridiculous misunderstanding but there are other problems this does not reconcile. From reviews and critiques of the movie including the narratives of both Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers it becomes clear that Ben Stein and Co. have brought their irrationality to several other fronts as well. When considering the accusations of Myers ""gate crashing"", the specious solicitation of interviews, and the egregious misquotations of Darwin himself, it becomes clear that this film was intended to be unfair. After all, they expelled someone with alternative views from watching the pre-release showing of a movie that he not only appears in but is thanked for during the end credits.

Mr. Steins film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed is an underhanded attack on the very nature of scientific progression and discovery, its methods, logic, and reason. The misunderstandings and outright lies that this movie will deposit in its undoubtably ignorant audience has the potential to set back our society's grasp of sciences for years to come.

Every major point of this film is fraudulent and what isn't a bold-faced lie has been twisted in some way as to make it look like something far different than it was.  For instance, the scientists who were 'expelled' (in the first third of the film) were not in fact expelled, and for each individual you will find a very different story than the one given in this movie.

Indeed, the very opening of the movie is fake.  The presentation that Stein is seen giving to an auditorium of college students itself was faked.

Even the interviews were filmed under false pretense.  Most of the evolutionary scientists (which are portrayed as either mad, crazy or intolerant) were asked to interview for a different film (Crossroads) which to be about the common ground between religion and science--not an outright science-bashing film, which is precisely what Expelled is.  Statements that the film underwent creative changes through its development is also bogus.  The 'expelled' website was purchased and held concurrent to the interviews done under the pretense of 'crossroads'.

Between the first half and the second, the film can't keep its lies straight--at first asking why a perfectly valid scientific theory (ID is a scientific theory???) has been shunned by the academic community, then shifts its focus to how evolution is really an attack on religion, breaking down the illusion that ID is anything other than a rewriting of creationism.

The last third of the film is surprisingly even worse than what proceeded it.  Stein just won't stop until he shows how terrible evolutionary theory is for all of us.  Don't you know that accepting evolution (or even learning about it) will turn you into an athiest? (never mind the huge numbers of Christian evolutionary scientists.)  But turning the whole world into godless hedonists isn't the worst evolution has to offer.  It is also responsible for the Jewish holocaust.

A review like this doesn't offer the scope to dissect this later point however I'll mention that the makers of the film offer no distinction between the theory of evolution and 'social Darwinism'--an abuse and misinterpretation of Darwin which has nothing to do with evolutionary theory.

Ultimately then, this film has no content of any real interest to offer other than the possible ironic value, and in its execution, it feels like a very shoddy attempt at doing Michael Moore.

3502723,1,B001BYLFFS,"""Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people."" -- Ben Stein, Interview with Paul Crouch, Jr. on the Trinity Broadcasting Network

This film essentially alleges that there is a conspiracy in ""Big Science"" and academia to suppress the development of the ""scientific theory"" of Intelligent Design, and has ""expelled"" and persecuted proponents of the idea.  It is an intriguing notion, and if our trusted academic institutions are indeed suppressing the development of good science in such a manner, an expos documentary on the subject would be doing us all a great service.

Since this is supposed to be a film about the suppression of legitimate science within academia, the first thing the film ought to have done is give a clear definition of the idea that is being suppressed and a clear, convincing explanation as to why it actually is science.  If this is not done (and it wasn't), the core premise of the film is moot.  If Intelligent Design is not science, then the notion that academics who are promoting ID as science are being marginalized, ignored or ""expelled"" should not get us too riled up.

Since the film glosses over Intelligent Design itself, I will give an explanation of what ID actually is.  The fact is that the term itself is vague and ill-defined, even by proponents of the idea.  Understood most broadly, Intelligent Design simply asserts that some intelligent agency was at work in the creation of life on Earth and the human species.  While this is a claim that one can attempt to evaluate utilizing the tools and methods of science, it is not a scientific theory or model ... and only in the weakest sense of the word could it semi-plausibly be accepted as a hypothesis.  This is because the assertion, ""life on Earth was designed by an intelligent agency"" implies absolutely nothing which can be tested (in science, this is absolutely vital, and a perceived lack of testability is one reason why many scientists say that String Theory/M-Theory is not really science, in spite of the fact that it makes many claims and has a lot of cool maths associated with it).  Intelligent design says little to nothing about the character and specific qualities of the supposed designer.  If you are examining Intelligent Design from a religious perspective, this might seem cheerily ecumenical -- any god you believe in can be the designer, whether you're a Jew, Christian, Muslim or other!  The problem is that science is supposed to be specific.  Ideas are supposed to make claims which can either be corroborated or falsified.

This is not just me speaking.  Virtually every academic institution in the world, and every major institute of science, and every credentialed expert in a field related to biology will tell you, Intelligent Design is not science.  Of course, if you believe the film, those scientists and institutes are the constituents of ""Big Science,"" and are engaged in a conspiracy to suppress ID, so they cannot be trusted.  This does not, however, excuse the film from demonstrating why the viewer should accept the vital claim that ID is science, however.  Instead of presenting facts to convince the viewer, that the film does is pander to the fears and prejudices of the audience in extolling the supposed evils of ID's ""rival,"" Darwinian evolution.  Combined with the testimony of a handful of credentialed ID proponents, this may enough to sell some viewers on the idea that ID is legitimate science and Big Science is up to some sort of skullduggery.

Probably the most impressively credentialed supporter of Intelligent Design is Michael Behe, a microbiologist.  When court convened in Dover to settle the legal question of whether ID is science, Behe testified in support of the affirmative, but was forced to concede in his testimony that, utilizing the definition of science that he was employing to classify ID as science, one could also justify calling astrology (that is, zodiac and horoscopes) science as well.  Not incidentally, the president Judge, John E. Jones, ruled that ID is not science, but rather religious creationism in disguise.  It may be noteworthy that Judge Jones leans conservative, and was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, an ID sympathizer.

So instead of establishing that ID is science, what does the film spend its time doing?  Essentially, it goes of on a witch-hunt which is only tangentially related to the film's primary claim.  Prominent anti-ID scientists are interviewed (often under false pretenses -- biologists Richard Dawkins and P.Z. Myers were given a false title for the film when they were interviewed, and were mislead about the tone and tenor of the documentary) and baited into making comments about the origins of life, for example, (a field of study known as abiogenesis, and not an area of expertise for the evolutionary biologists who were interviewed) so the information that was offered could be edited down and presented in a context that makes those scientists the butt of the film's joke.  This has nothing to do with ID as science, or ID proponents being expelled, but instead is a transparent effort to make good, honest scientists appear absurd or worse.

When I say ""or worse,"" I mean the very worst.  Since the film essentially has no facts to present to convince the viewer that ID is science, and very little of substance to suggest that anybody has actually been ""expelled"" or unfairly treated, Darwinian evolution is relentlessly bashed, an exercise sure to delight the religious conservatives and fundamentalists who compose the film's core intended audience.  The film does nothing less than blame Hitler's holocaust on evolution.

The idea is as absurd and offensive as it sounds.  The way the film does this is point out the fact that the theory of evolution has been used to justify eugenics (the idea that one can produce desirable traits in a population by various means such as selective breeding -- which can involve the death or sterilization of ""undesirables."")  The film totally glosses over is question of IS vs. OUGHT.  Virtually everyone in the world, evolutionary biologist, scientist, or non-scientist, understands that just because it is POSSIBLE to do a thing, it does not mean that it OUGHT to be done.  Further, there are many things about evolution and natural selection that may prove distressing or displeasing to someone.  However, that says absolutely nothing about the truth value of the theory of evolution.  The fact that hurricanes occur and hundreds while devastating communities is unpleasant.  Nonetheless, the fact that hurricanes can or do occur is not any reason to rewrite theories in meteorology that explain how and why hurricanes occur.

The film never treats its purported subject matter in a way that demonstrates and real intelligence, nuance, balance or taste.  It is nothing but a scattershot assault on science (primarily ""Darwinian"" evolution) and none of its claims are ever substantially validated.  The greatest thing of value that this film offers is that it shows the true colors of Intelligent Design supporters and its allies in the religious right.",1217289600,14,7202,5.017647058823529

3502726,1,B001BYLFFS,"This movie tries to be a conservative version of Michael Moore, and fails miserably.  This movie might be ignored or simply laughed at if it weren't a symptom of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  Among the many failings and falsehoods of this movie are:

1. It misrepresents the cases of the people supposedly ""expelled"". (They weren't)
2. It displays stunning ignorance of evolution by natural selection (EBNS) and the evidence for it.
3. It fails to present any case whatsoever for creationism or its politically-correctly renamed iteration, ""Intelligent Design.""
4. The producers approached the scientists who participated under false pretenses.  And they then edited the interviews with these scientists to make them look foolish or sinister.
5. It tries to smear EBNS and scientists generally with some completely unsupported connection to the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany. (This ham-handed and disgusting tactic is what drew the most fire from critics.)
6. It fails to present the thousands of working scientists, including biologists such as Ken Miller, who are also firm believers in some kind of personal deity.

Please search the web for expelledexposed to get the real story behind this movie and the supposedly ""expelled"" academics.  They were not ""expelled""; and this movie spreads bald lies about their situations.  Please also see the NOVA program ""Judgment Day"" about the Dover, PA trial of ID-creationism for the real story of ID (it is religion, not science:  even a conservative GW Bush appointee could clearly see that.)

For the record and in accordance with items 2 and 5 above:  Nazi Germany's eugenics, like all eugenics plans, was an artificial selection program, determined by humans.  This is completely different from natural selection.  (Not survival of the fittest; but rather survival of those who are politically-favored.)  And, even if Hitler had invoked Charles Darwin as some kind of justification for his evil deeds (he didn't), he STILL would have been misunderstanding Darwin's idea of EBNS.  Darwin drew a crystal clear distinction between artificial human selection (in for instance the breeding of pigeons and livestock) and the workings of natural selection.  If you read, ""On the Origin of Species"" you will discover that for yourself.

In addition:  ID is not science. I've read Behe and Dembski and other ID cdesign proponentsists [sic:  see Of Pandas and People]. They have but a single argument to make (they have no theory, no experiments, no data, no results) and I will summarize it: [Biological feature X] is too complicated for me to understand how it could have evolved, therefore God had to have done it, QED. This is simply a non sequitur. William Dembski's, my, or your lack of intellectual skills or knowledge neither requires nor implies anything about the nature of reality. A federal judge has ruled in detail that ID is religion. Magic explains nothing*. Magic is not science. Incredulity is not science: it is IGNORANCE. Science DISPELS ignorance by hypothesis and testing to find out the FACTS in the case.  (* If magic is allowed, then ANY effect can be equally well asserted to follow ANY cause; all rules of logic and evidence fail, and no conclusions can be drawn.)

Why were film clips of Nazi Germany and concentration camps included in this film?  Ben Stein gives us the answer: In an interview with the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Ben Stein said the following amazing things in an interview with Paul Crouch, Jr.

Stein: When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [i.e. biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed ... that was horrifying beyond words, and that's where science - in my opinion, this is just an opinion - that's where science leads you.

Crouch: That's right.

Stein: ...Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.

Crouch: Good word, good word.

That's your Ben Stein. That's what this film is about: trying to discredit science.

3502778,4,B001BYLFFS,"This is my attempt to actually give a review based on what I saw in the movie, not on any predetermined bias to join in the lynching everyone else seems to think they are so profound in taking part.

First, to get a few things straight:

This movie does not promote Intelligent Design, or Creationism. That makes 3/4 of these reviews irrelevant.

The purpose of this movie is not to discredit evolution, or promote intelligent design.

The main premise of the movie is to expose the mob mentality that has (Apparently) overtaken the science community, specifically relating to the open discussion of possible origins of life. The point made is that science is a venue in which ideas are explored, and none should be denied that opportunity until they are fully evaluated and judged upon. Those interviewed in the movie simply assert that their opinions (that intelligence/complexity may be born of intelligence) are not given an arena, but not for reasons of a scientific origin, but bias. Simply put, the scientific community wants nothing said of intelligent design, no matter its relevance, based on anti-religious bias, not science.

Pro's:

1) Funny. Stein did a great job of using humor.

2) Balanced. Both sides were able to share their views in the interviews.

3) Stein's main goal, to simply show the lack of ability for scientists to discuss -possible- avenues of design found in nature, is reached in the interviews of both sides.

4) True colors revealed. When asked about their reasons for why they support the censoring of scientific exploration of the origins of nature, they don't give scientific reasons. They use mostly ad hominem and straw man arguments to shows it really is about their own bias, not about honest scientific exploration. (And in one case you have Dawkins promoting the idea of intelligent life on earth being ""seeded"" by intelligent creatures.----""Oh but he was quoted out of context"" some will say. Watch and judge for yourself, there is no way around it, its not about science for him, it's about winning.) As for the others (those thrown out because of the mere mention of possible intelligent design) they are shown to not be religious nuts, most if not all are non-religious.

Con's:

1) The attempt at connecting evolution to the holocaust was an obvious emotional appeal and a drawback. This movie would have benefited from leaving this out.

2) The time spent on that last portion could have been spent showing a discussion of responses (more so than given) between the different scientists representing each side.

3) More specifics on how the scientific community shuns any mention of intelligent design.

If you have not seen this movie than it is worth watching. Despite what most reviewers will say here, it is not promoting intelligent design, but the openness of the scientific process, which he successfully displays as being suffocated.",1217203200,28,2891,4.983367983367984

3502801,1,B001BYLFFS,"William Dembski and fawning sycophants ""Intelligent Design""  web site, Uncommon Descent has this to say about ID:

""...intelligent design (ID) offers a promising scientific alternative to materialistic theories of biological and cosmological evolution -- an alternative that is finding increasing theoretical and empirical support.""

Clearly then, the main premise of this movie is that ID should be considered as a viable and equal alternative to evolution.  Consequently, the movie argues, it is unjust to ""expell"" proponents of ID from academia since all they are doing is offering an alternative ""scientific"" viewpoint.  For a moment, we'll overlook the fact (as so well documented on expelledexposed.com) that none of the defendants portrayed in the movie really were expelled.  We'll also overlook the deception used to portray the movie to some interviewees as an entirely different kind of movie.  Or that they had to hire ""students"" to listen to Ben Stein at Pepperdine as the real students weren't apparently interested in participating.  We'll also overlook the fact that the movie completely ignores the viewpoints of those (like Ken Miller) who are in fact theists but support evolution.  Instead perhaps its worth looking at the scientific credentials of both ID and evolution.

And what do we have on the ID side in terms of the ""overwhelming evidence"" that ID hyperbolists are famous for?  Surprisingly, not much  In fact it's so little, you wonder how ID supports even manage to write books out of what they do have.  And of course it's no wonder that the movie largely avoids exploring this so-called evidence.  Whereas evolution has an amazingly rich and increasingly detailed account of how life has changed over time, ID refuses to even posit any actual alternative.  With evolution you have a rich, multi-disciplined array of evidence - genetics, the geological and fossil records, cosmology, homology, experimental evidence of speciation and natural selection etc, etc, etc.  Put together there is a compelling overarching framework for how life has changed over time.

And what do we have on the side of ID?  For a start there is absolutely no overarching narrative - you won't find anything about who, what, how, why, when.  And don't you DARE ask who the designer is because that's out of bounds (but WIlliam Dembski has made it quite clear he thinks it is the God of the Bible,  even though ID completely contradicts the creation story in the Bible).  Instead, what you will find is a disjointed and barely intelligible mish-mash of ideas - Irreducible Complexity, the fine-tuning argument and of course Dembski's infamous 'CSI' - no, not the interesting and gripping TV series, but instead Dembski's arcane and obdurate mathematical ideas of 'Complex Specified Information' that have been thoroughly and re-soundly refuted (and has yet to find any real useful practical application).  Same with IR - it's been thoroughly refuted and there are good plausible explanations for fine-tuning (not least of which is the fact that 99.9999999% of the Universe is in fact NOT fine-tuned for life at all!)

Even more surprising is the complete and utter ignorance displayed by Ben Stein on the subject of evolution - both in the movie and on the movie's web site.  For somebody who portrays himself as an intellectual it's really rather sad that he got so conned in making this dreadful excuse of a documentary.

They also attempt to demonstrate a concerted academic conspiracy against anti-evolutionists.  These are laughably one-sided and fall to even the most superficial investigation.

3502810,1,B001BYLFFS,"Posted here, for the record, is the review I wrote for Calgary's Beatroute magazine, when this dreck was first unleashed upon the Canadian public:

Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed invites moviegoers to follow Ben Stein on a facetious process of discovery as he attempts to determine ""what's so bad about evolution."" As he takes the stage in a full auditorium, extolling the virtues of free speech to his audience, we're told that scientists have been ""expelled"" from teaching positions, positions at the Smithsonian, and the like for daring to posit ideas associated with ""Intelligent Design."" For those unfamiliar, I.D. is a non-empirical worldview originating from the theist argument that an intelligent creator generated the universe. Stein frames this as an issue of persecution; that these few, brave souls have defied the ""scientific establishment"" and been punished for it.

Let's run down the list of things Ben Stein is hoping you'll ignore long enough for his propaganda to kick in.

-Science does not reject nor oppress religion, merely makes no attempt to explain it.
-The fellow who is suggested to have lost his job at the Smithsonian never worked there, and was on a limited-term contract at a partner institution.
-The audience in that auditorium was staged. Stein does not regularly make speaking appearances.
-Prominent evolutionary biologists such as P.Z. Meyers and Richard Dawkins were hoodwinked into appearing in the movie, having been told they were being interviewed for another feature, exploring the intersection of science and religion.

Let's leave aside for a moment the minor objectionable material in this heavy-handed, ill-informed diatribe, such as the brief cuts to black-and-white footage of guillotines and firing squads during interviews with the ""expelled"" scientists, or his framing of Abiogenesis arguments as quack science; we don't expect honest dialogue from Nixon's speechwriter.

Let's look at Stein's exploitation of the Holocaust to serve his ends.

According to Stein, ""Darwinism"" leads inexorably to the devaluation of human life that he feels was responsible for the extermination of six million Jewish people. He quotes Darwin's On the Origin of Species: ""With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.""  Never mind that he's chosen only the pieces of that passage that show Darwin's writing in the worst possible light - space restrictions prevent me from offering the full paragraph.

Let us look, instead, at the very next sentences in Darwin's work.

""The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused.

""Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature.""

To quote mathematician and scientific historian Jacob Bronowski, another Jewish man, speaking of the intersection of science and fascism, as he stood at Auschwitz;

""It is said that science will dehumanize people, and turn them into numbers; that's false, tragically false.  Look for yourself - this is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.

Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It was done by arrogance, it was done by dogma, it was done by ignorance.

When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.

Science is a very human form of knowledge.  We are always at the brink of the known.  We always feel forward, for what is to be hoped.  Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error and is personal.  Science is a tribute to what we can know ALTHOUGH we are fallible.

In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell; 'I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.'

I owe it, as a scientist, to my friend Leo Szilard, I owe it as a human being to the many members of my family who died here, to stand here as a survivor and a witness.  We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power.  We have to close the distance between the push-button order, and the human act.

We have to touch people.""

In Stein's repugnant agenda, we find none of the human compassion, none of the understanding of the deep complexities of humanity's interaction with science, none of the wisdom and comfort offered by these two esteemed scholars.  Stein resorts to polemical statements, hoping to, as Naomi Klein would no doubt recognize, shock people into accepting his outrageous claims of association between Darwinian evolution, and the heinous crime of the Holocaust.  He is desperately hoping that people will not recognize the outrageous nature of this association; that people will not realize, amid all the deep, ominously thrumming music and grave statements, that blaming Darwin for the Holocaust is akin to blaming the Wright brothers for 9/11.

Lousy in every respect: research, direction, editing, lighting, narration...you name it. Stein's lame attempt to discredit *real* scientists through clever editing and documented deception is a comic failure.

Anyone with a college education--or a reasonably good high school education--understands the mechanisms of natural selection. Those who are educated *and* religious usually have little difficulty accepting scientific truth along with their faith; some don't and, like Stein, choose instead to attack biology because it threatens their deeply held mythologies and superstitions.

Stein's cinematic tripe isn't going to change anyone's mind about evolution or religion; content aside, though, it is a very poorly produced film, and it has certainly exposed Stein as a hack.",1217203200,113,942,5.818840579710145

3502845,1,B001BYLFFS,"""Expelled - No Intelligence Allowed"" was a sleazy, low budget attempt to make an end run around the scientific establishment, educators and the U.S. courts to promote creationism. It was ""designed with very little intelligence"" to argue that a world-wide conspiracy to advance atheism exists among academia.
Ben Stein who has played a boring teacher in several TV episodes and in the hit movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", stays true to  character and drones his way through this tedious, anti-science and anti-evolution polemic. Stein was a major casting disaster for the producers. As a one dimensional bit-player, Stein simply doesn't have enough screen personality to carry a full length release by himself.
Seeing the film in theatrical preview confirmed my worst fears, ""Expelled"" distorted well established scientific facts and used deceptive interviewing techniques to ""trap"" some of those who are critical of attempts to introduce creationism into the public educational system.  Worse still, was the fact that the film never attempted to explain much about Intelligent Design/Creationism as a viable alternative theory.
Finally, if the false representations and distortions weren't reason enough to avoid Expelled, the amateurish production values (dark, ponderous imagery and snail-paced editing) make this film difficult to sit through, even for diehard advocates of creationism.

I remembered Win Ben Stein's money from Comedy Central, and who could forget Ferris Bueller?  Plus it was about the current science education system in the US which is something I feel is extremely important.

First of all, I just could not get over the fact that the movie compared evolution-accepting scientists and educators to Nazis... what utter drivel.  As a biology student in my university, hopefully on my way to becoming a professor, I found this horribly offensive.

Next I realized the movie was essentially propaganda supporting a direct injection of pseudo-science into the school system via the court system.  This is NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS!! For more info on that, research the ""scientific method"", and the ""peer review process"".  Neither Creationism nor Intelligent Design have been able to make it through either of these necessary scientific processes.  The one and only problem with a democracy is that the masses can be easily controlled with a slick media presentation, especially one that uses scare tactics like comparing its opponents to Nazi Germany.  This movie worries me for this reason...

The movie did make some seemingly interesting points (if they had been true) about various scientists who were fired from their jobs for doubting evolution.  Lucky I had my notebook on me, and was able to write down their names for further research later that night.  Guillermo Gonzalez and Richard Sternberg are the two names I still remember.  Turns out they weren't fired at all.  One was an astrophysicist who was only able to bring in about $200K in grants at the university he worked for (Univ of Iowa I believe) when the average for a prof there is right around 1.3 MILLION DOLLARS... thats only 15% of the average.  He tried to apply for tenure, but obviously his application wasn't accepted, due to his abysmal performance.  The movie calls this being ""denied tenure"" and acts like its some huge big deal, as if its illegal or something, when its not... its business as usual.  Tenure is reserved for the big fish... the really smart guys who the schools can't afford to get rid of.  Its not for the guys who can't manage to get a reviewed research paper published within the 7 years they work for the university... and its also not for the Professors who don't even manage to pass one graduate student during their career.

The other name I'm able to remember, Richard Sternberg, had a similarly false story.  There were 6 or 8 of them in all, and if you do a google search for ""Expelled Exposed"" there is a pretty good resource there to find out more about ridiculously-over-exaggerated claims in the movie.  Several of the people who claimed they were ""expelled"" or fired from there teaching and research positions because of their views seemed to be bending the truth a bit, to the point that they damn near broke it in half.  Most of them were simply not great professors (or they were lowly research assistants) whose contracts ran out, and who the university saw no reason to re-hire... once again, this is business as usual, and should not be misconstrued as misconduct of any kind!

3502936,1,B001BYLFFS,"I'll give Ben Stein and the producers of this film this much credit, like any propagandist they know their audience.  This documentary made no effort to tell the truth, and certainly showed no intelligence, designed or otherwise. It was aimed squarely at people already desperate to believe the claims that there are genuine conflicts within the world of evolutionary theory. It was aimed squarely at people who know as little about biology and evolution, and cling as much to dogma and religion in the face of overwhelming evidence as the proponents of Intelligent Design do. As a result the documentary presents a highly biased, highly deceptive (right down to how interviews were gained), and  completely inaccurate view of scientific community, which their chosen audience is only to glad to eat up. Worse, the documentary is amateurishly presented, and stunningly boring. It is hard to imagine what kind of mental acrobatics someone has to use in order to give this utter joke a 5 star review. Even if you buy into the hogwash being presented it takes some effort to ignore the laughable presentation. The proponents of Intelligent Design, such as Behe, Dembski, Luskin and the Discovery Institute have been given a number of chances to prove they have actual evidence and testable methods proving ID, and they have failed every time. Their own internal documents prove they know they have no real evidence or theory, but intend to use ID to wedge creationism back into society. In Kitzmiller vs Dover they were humiliated and their ideas rejected in a court of law. This is not a case of a new and valid scientific idea being over turned for the comfortable status quo, this is science rejecting out right fantasy and religious based ideas that have no evidence and no value. Intelligent Design has no real interest in science, it uses pseudo-science to try convince the gullible and ignorant that there is something more to it than an attempt to get age old creationism back into schools. Personally if you reject Evolution I think you should stand up for your beliefs and reject any of the things that relied on it to exist, like almost all the medicine you use, most of the food you eat, most of the diagnostic or medical practices that save lives. All of biology hangs on evolution, all of biology supports evolution, every new discovery for the last 150 years has reinforced evolution and that is the way reality is. Rejecting evolution is about as sane as saying the world is flat or the Sun orbits the Earth. Intelligent Design has no predictive power, it offers no new knowledge, answers no new questions, it closes the mind to evidence and clings to out dated ideas, and pretends they aren't religious in origin.

I'm more interested in reviewing Expelled as a movie. It isn't a good movie, in fact it is a very bad movie. For some unknown reason, it is very poorly produced, the lighting is bad, the camera work is weird and at times almost amateurish.

The pacing of the movie is also off kilter. It starts of with the premise that Intelligent Design is being unfairly attacked by ""Big Science"". It interviews various anti-evolution folk, ungodly scientist and makes claims that ID is not a religious belief. It essentially lays claim that ID is not religious but it is being persecuted.

By the second half of the movie it changes direction and makes grand claims about how evolution and Darwin led to Nazism and caused the Holocaust. This is a premise which is just disgusting, manipulative and plain wrong. What I find amusing is at this point, it loses all pretense in claiming ID is not religious by using many religious quotes.

Never mind the propaganda, what's worse is that it is boring. Very very boring. The jokes fall flat, the music is over the top in attempted emotional manipulation.

3502963,1,B001BYLFFS,"Ben Stein's ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" is pure fundamentalist propaganda, replete with all the logical fallacies that fundamentalist Christians use to undermine evolutionary theory.  The film endeavors to demonstrate that most of the scientific community is engaged in a massive conspiracy to prohibit the teaching of Intelligent Design (ID).

The film can essentially be broken down into three segments

1. Stein illustrates the purported costly consequences to any academic who proposes the legitimacy of ID by covering a few cases where professors were fired who promulgated ID.

2. He interviews some illustrious science figures, who advocate ID, by showing how cogent their principal argument against evolution is - that being the notion of irreducible complexity.

3. Stein finally spends an inordinate amount of the final portion of the film illustrating the negative social consequences of Darwinism.

In this three pronged approach he commits numerous fallacies ranging from non sequiturs, ad hominem attacks, straw men arguments, and slippery slope speculations.  The movie is such a pile of childlike polemic that it really doesn't even deserve a rebuttal, but since so many credulous right wing Christians will use it as a primer and source of edification, we on the secular side of the fence need to address it at length.

With regards to first point, where Stein introduces testimony from professors who have been fired, and ascribes their termination as being merely the result of their adherence to ID, Stein mostly focuses on the testimony of the professors themselves.  He never offers up one shred of substantial evidence that their termination was the direct result of their belief in ID. He quickly flashes some memos and emails in front of the screen so quickly that one doesn't have time to read it, and even the content of most of this written material is blacked out.  Stein, near the end of the film, interviews one or two administrators at academic institutions and the Smithsonian to inquire as to why these professors were terminated, but since he was interviewing administrators that were probably far removed from the case, the only response he got back was administrative talk. Thus Stein disingenuously made it look like that these administrators were trying to evade the point. Most administrators are not at liberty, due to policies of the institution that employs them, to go into detail as to why a professor was terminated.

Stein's second tactic is so clichd that anyone who has a cursory familiarity with ID and the rhetoric used to justify it, will recognize the tactic he is using. Basically he employs the irreducible complexity argument, using the cell as an example, to demonstrate the cell itself, being one of the fundamental building blocks of all organisms, could not come into being through natural selection. He interviews a few fringe scientists to make his case. Of course, Stein ignores the volumes of evolutionary literature that demonstrate how the cell could have come about through natural selection. Of course to be fair and balanced in reality is far too difficult to do, and so it is easier to resort to the Fox News version of ""fair and balanced"".  In any case, to say something is too complicated to come about due to gradual advantageous mutations, and generational transmission of those mutations, and therefore God must have done it, is such a non sequitur that it only merits a laugh and then a scornful look. Stein, throughout his film, attempts to highlight the atheistic hubris behind evolutionary claims, and yet nothing could be more arrogant than to state that a mystery that evolution supposedly cannot explain must prove a God is behind it. Even if evolution could not explain the inner functions of a cell, why preclude some alternate NATURALISTIC explanation, which has yet to be discovered? Why only conclude that God could be the only explanation? This would be almost akin to claiming omniscience for yourself.  What could be more arrogant than that?

Stein tries to buttress this argument with numerous interviews from scientists who promote this view, who profess not to be religious. Thus Stein tries to make the case that this is all about fairness and Intelligent Design is not about the promotion of religion. Yet, he unfairly characterizes evolution as inherently atheistic propaganda, by interviewing a few atheistic Darwinian proponents like Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennet, Richard Dawkins, and Peter Atkins, and how their journey towards atheism was informed by Darwinism, and yet he seems blissfully unaware that many prominent theists, both philosophers and scientists, see no contradiction between evolution and religion. It is interesting that everyone who he interviews, who professes NOT to be religious, never affirms the truth of ID, but only goes so far as to say that the scientific community is unfair in blocking the admission of ID in the scientific world. Unlike evolution, the true adherents to ID only are only people of faith. So which group has an agenda, other than the promotion of true science?

The third and most appalling element of Stein's attack on evolution is his illustration that evolutionary theory has been the cause of humanities most grievous sins, and he specifically cites Nazism, and the genocide of 6 million people, as the direct result of Darwinist thinking. To make his case he cites a few quotes from Hitler and other prominent Nazis, where they garb their bloodthirsty agenda in a thin veneer of Darwinian verbiage, and takes Darwin's writings out of context. Incidentally, Stein being Jewish, states that this is especially painful for him. Like so many other instances in ""Expelled"", Stein appeals to emotion rather than reason, even though this film is supposed to be about fairness in our view of science, something that is supposed to be devoid of emotion.

The first problem with Stein's approach at vilifying Darwinism, by making the Holocaust a logical consequence of evolutionary theory, is that the negative consequences of a belief do not falsify a belief. Remember this film is supposed to be about objectivity and fairness in science, not about the social consequences of belief.

 Furthermore, an accurate historical portrayal would also reveal that the Nazi propaganda machine against the Jews, and other undesirables, could not work without the centuries of prejudice against the Jews that was specifically engineered by Christendom, over the course of nearly two millennia. Stein doesn't even quote the numerous examples in the Gospels, and the writings of Paul that could be construed today as anti-Semitic - all of which has deep influences on European culture.  Stein doesn't even mention the numerous instances in which Hitler and the Nazi upper echelon used theistic language about the divine destiny of the Nordic race to dominate the world, and how the Aryan people, where considered by Hitler, to be the chosen people of God. He doesn't cite numerous speeches of Hitler where he expresses this very sentiment.  Stein doesn't mention that most of the Nazis, including Hitler himself, were confirmed Catholics who never sought to renounce their faith. Nor does Stein mention that the whole notion of God having a chosen people, who have a divine mandate to displace and destroy other people who are not ""chosen"", comes from religion, and that the most prominent example of this is found in his own Jewish tradition. The argument from ""Intelligent Design"", after all, can be equally effective, as history attests, to justifying the extermination of different races and groups of people. Again Stein prefers the Fox News version of ""fair and balanced"" as opposed to the genuine article.

Stein's finishing touch on this tragedy of cinematic propaganda was to interview the most prominent atheist of our times, Richard Dawkins, and ask him questions, and then selectively edit the responses to make him look like he was stumped. Having seen Dawkins answer questions like this before, in a non edited format, in other forums, I could tell that his cogent responses were edited out to make him look ignorant.

Throughout Stein's ""Expelled"" there are images of the Berlin Wall, and basically Stein uses it as an analogy of how the scientific community is exercising censorial control to bar Intelligent Design from being taught in school. Yet, isn't Stein, through his one sided treatment of this issue, being just as bad as the oppressive Soviet monument he uses as an analogy? The Soviet Union not only retained control of its people through blockading them, but by misrepresenting the other side to the people they ruled over. Stein, in this sense, is just as guilty as the scientific establishment he derides, of engaging in the behavior fitting of any despotic regime.",1217030400,13,8837,5.147838214783821

3502965,5,B001BYLFFS,"Many reviewers of this movie claim the main theme, that those who do not believe in Darwinism, are discriminated against in academia, is false. I did a little research and found a case that is above board, that of  Nathaniel Abraham, Ph. D. He is a biologist and research scientist specializing in zebra fish, developmental biology, and programmed cell death.  He was fired from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in March of 2004.  The reason in writing was  Dr. Abraham does not accept evolution as a scientific fact.  His lawyer said his termination (most of this information came from the law firm who carefully researched his case), is just one of many scientists and academics who have dedicated years of their lives to the pursuit of scientific knowledge; but because they are unwilling to spout the party line with respect to evolution, they are being forced out of their profession. Dr. Abraham earned his Ph. D. in biology at St. John's University in New York  and while there did a groundbreaking doctoral dissertation on zebrafish.  Dr. Abraham was well respected at St. John's, and it was no secret there that he was a strong Christian who believed in Creation.  Many of his colleagues there enjoyed asking him questions about science and religion.  In the first sentence of the acknowledgements in his doctoral thesis Dr. Abraham thanked Jesus Christ. While Dr. Abraham was completing his Ph. D. program at St. John's, he found a postdoctoral position to continue his research,  married, and brought his wife to America.  Scientists at Woods Hole were interested in expanding their toxicology laboratory to include programmed cell death research using the zebrafish benchmark model, Dr. Abraham's specialty, so hired him.  Dr. Abraham was so valuable to them that he assisted them for several months in designing and building their lab before he joined them as a fulltime researcher.  The relationship between Dr. Abraham and Woods Hole was mutually beneficial and productive but in a passing conversation with his supervisor over lunch, Dr. Abraham happened to mention creationism. This set off alarm bells, so Dr. Abraham noted that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if warranted, but was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as scientific fact.  Dr. Abraham also pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing.  He had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University where his faith was not an issue.  Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should follow the evidence wherever it led.  The establishment scientists at Woods Hole, though, wanted Dr. Abraham to share their wholehearted acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact or, they told him he was not fit to work in the field of science-at least not at their prestigious laboratory.  They finally told Dr. Abraham he would have to leave if he did not accept evolution as fact.  Dr. Abraham's decision to hold to his belief in Creation was a very costly decision for him.  Without a job, Dr. Abraham would lose his visa, which would soon expire.  Woods Hole was not willing to even permit Dr. Abraham to complete the first year of his three-year employment.  As a result, Dr. Abraham was forced to send his expectant wife home to India, and he missed the birth of his first child.  Attorneys now representing Dr. Abraham in a lawsuit against Woods Hole want to test whether America's courts will permit this sort of blatant religious discrimination against scientists in America.  As the film Expelled documents, scientists no longer  have the freedom to follow the evidence from their discoveries, if it leads to design or to a Creator.  This is tragic.  Science must again be truly objective.  If the evidence leads to design so be it.",1216857600,28,3842,5.0078740157480315

Second, it clearly shows some of the detrimental applications of evolution in the mass murder of over 5 millions Jews and other by Hitler, attempting to ""improve"" the race by ""helping"" evolution eliminate those he deemed unfit.

I have seen a lot of movies and I have never, ever, experienced the audience applaud afterward! I also find it of interest to note that the Christian, Jewish and Muslim media has, with rare exceptions, lauded the film, but the secular media, with only a few exceptions, has tried to trash the film. One of the most common claims against the film is the association in the film of the holocaust with Darwinism. It appears the misinformation about this event is more of a problem then I ever realized possible. The clear connection between the two has been well documented. One of the most authoritative histories of the holocaust, The Complete History of the Holocaust edited by Mitchell Geoffrey Bard,  concluded ""The Nazis combined their racial theories [especially those of Nietzsche who got his ideas from Darwin] with the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin to justify their treatment of the Jews"" (2001, p. 34). I know of not a single reputable historian who denies this fact of history (and I do not know of one unreputable historian that denies it either!). In reading Mein Kampf (especially in German) makes this both very obvious and very clear. Bard et al. states that ""Hitler was one of the most honest politicians of our time, doing ... precisely what he said he would do. This is particularly evident in his treatment of the Jews"" (2001, p. 37). And Hitler made it clear what he was going to do to ""evolutionarly inferior people"" and why. This criticism of the film is not just misleading, but uninformed, irresponsible, and worse. The purpose is the suppression of the film, as was Yoko Ono Lennon's lawsuit which failed (the court threw out her lawsuit). Fortunately, the film is getting out there and having an effect in spite of the vicious campaign against it.

3502985,5,B001BYLFFS,"This movie shines a light on neo-Darwinism and shows it for what it truly is: a blind faith in a non-observable and non-reproducible belief-system that opposes, not only the observable and provable sciences, but also, open-mined thoughts and logical reasoning as well. Neo-Darwinists have become the very thing they fear and loath the most, a dogmatic religion of condemning mind-sets and persecuting actions all in the name of a futile and imagined belief-system in the hap-hazard and so-called random organization of dead inorganic matter into meticulously organized organic living things. Science is all about observable and repeating phenomenon.

And yet, the phenomenon of the neo-Darwinists is described in great detail in the one book these neo-""non""-believers detest the most; the bible. The written series of books the creator gave us through His chosen people. In just one half of one chapter you can read in great detail and with clarity what happens to people who refuse to believe in a creator.

Basically, it is a step by step process of letting go by the creator such that we will reveal the very real nature in all of us. (See Romans 1:18-32) It accounts the dreadful observable and repeating behavior and regretfully the resulting dangerous attitudes of people who through their own impiety reject the creator. Observable and repetitive, generation after generation.

The God of creation is not a God of a religion. He is real, loving and caring. And most important of all, He, in His perfection, can not force us to love Him back. We can even totally reject the very concept of a creator. Neo-Darwinists prove it. The creator has given us a freedom all too few truly understand. But, we all will face a judgment based on our doing that will place us in eternity in one of two states: with Him or without Him. This is the ultimate freedom of choice.  God does not force us to love Him, even though He loves us all. He loves us so much He paid the price for our sins and sin nature. Accept that and you're saved. Reject that and you're not. No action by any person even yourself can save you except accepting the means that God provided. Not water baptism, not killing others, not being pious, nothing, except the simplist belief that salvation comes from God, not from our selves. Sinful people can't save themselves. Anyone who claims to be without sin is calling God a liar and the truth is not in you. But confessing sin, it is God who does the forgiving and cleasening. (see 1-John 1:8-10)

Still, some of the stories and comments just felt ""wrong"" or ""out of place"".  Later I found out the real reasons things felt ""off"" at ExpelledExposed, other reviews, Dawkins' site, and so on.  I was totally repulsed.

Granted, there were points of the documentary I found amusing, such as when Ben was trying to find the Discovery Institute, and got lost, and so on, and I think artistically this documentary was well done and appeared cohesive.  Factually and ethically however, its a mess!

I can't understand how people think the scene where Stein harasses Dawkins is funny or proves anything.  Stein was asking leading questions to explicitly get Dawkins to come up with a POSSIBLE scenario in which a designer might be POSSIBLE.  Please note, he did not ask Dawkins to come up with something TRUE or something Dawkins BELIEVES.  He asked Dawkins for POSSIBILITY.  So, Dawkins came up with the first probable solution, which he clearly didn't believe, but to answer the absurd question.  Then, Stein takes what Dawkins says and rips it out of context!  This was the point of the movie I almost walked out in anger, not necessarily at his point, or at ID, or whatever else supporters of this movie thing we get mad at, but at his horrific interviewing technique!  No self-respecting documentary filmmaker, writer, or reporter should pull comments out of leading questions to support their point.  Its low, and despicable.  If they can't support their argument without resorting to such below-the-belt techniques, what does that say about their validity?  However, I didn't leave because we spent a whole $10 on it, and bought Icees, too.  After I saw the absurdity that followed, I almost wish I had.

Because... then came the Nazis.  I think this topic has been covered pretty well by other reviewers, but I would like to point out another instance in this sequence that epitomizes the poor interviewing technique and low standards of this documentary.  He is talking to a tour guide in a holocaust museum, pulling every bit of emotional weight into the situation.  He then asks the tour guide ""If you could say anything to Dr. *whatever the name was, who did horrible experiments*, what would you say to him?"" and ""Don't you think it odd that the real insane ones were the people doing the experiments?""  In any other high quality documentary, these deeply personal and subjective questions would not have been asked of a neutral tour guide.  He was trying to force her to take a side so that he could claim another ally and invoke a reactionary response among those in the audience sympathetic to his positions.  Of all those interviewed, I give her the most credit.  She was not expecting to be forced to take a side, or harassed, she was probably just expecting to walk the cameras through the museum and explain the history.  However, she was able to remain neutral in face of such a celebrity and pressure, and did not allow them any opportunity to twist her words to their cause.

Additionally, the interviews on the evolutionary end were lacking.  We only saw a few of the key faces in the scientific community, and only those which would create a polarized reaction, such as Dawkins and Scott.  What about Micheal Ruse?  Why did he only get a 1-minute clip?  If you watch the special features on Flock of Dodos, where they have an hour long debate, it is obvious that this man needed more face time.  But they didn't want that, did they?  They'd rather have the ""fundamentalist atheist"" Dawkins as the sole figurehead of evolution, so they could make it a game of faith / no faith, religion / irreligion, rather than addressing the real issue -- Intelligent Design has no scientific backing.
Additionally, notice how the ID interviews are largely based on sob-stories and touchy-feely emotional aspects of the issue (""Oh, you lost your job, how HORRIBLE!!!""). In contrast, the interviews for the evolutionary side had everything to do with facts and figures, leaving little room for the audience to get-to-know and connect with the evolutionists ""as people"".  The only exception to this is Dawkins, we get to know him as an atheist who lost his faith because of evolution... not something for the average American audience to sympathize with.

Lets look a briefly at the filming technique.  I noticed a subtle lighting technique used in the interviews that lent a strong bias towards the ID side and away from the evolution side.  Notice when Stein is interviewing the ID supporters, the location is relaxed (in a park, reclining in a comfy chair, in a cafe, etc).  The lighting is soft, bright, and warm.  Compare this to the evolution interviews with cold, harsh lighting, high contrast, and an uninviting setting such as a stark room, or the bookshelves and studies of Academia.  While this may sound like nitpicking, lighting techniques and subtlety is the heart of artistic composition, and the key to controlling the emotions and minds of viewers.

Finally, it must be acknowledged that the documentary does not explain the pseudoscience behind ID in the first place, it merely cries discrimination.  An average viewer would leave knowing no more of ID than the fact that its being ""unjustly"" shunned by the scientific community.  The fact is, ID is not science.  It is pure conjecture and speculation.  The best thing ID proponents have going for them is a concept called ""irreducible complexity"" (read as: this looks like it was designed and we can't figure out how it works, so a designer did it), but did they discuss in-depth the implications of irreducible complexity, at the very least? NO!  If they had, it would have become immediately obvious that we are no longer looking at science but pure conjecture masquerading under the name of ""science"" with no backing in experimentation and traditional scientific rigor.  This goes against the narrow scope of what the producers of Expelled wanted, and thus, they don't go into what ID theory really is.

Only waste your money on this movie when it hits the ""buy two get one free"" bin at the used video store in the next few months, as it inevitably will, and only waste your time watching it for laughs.",1216166400,390,6755,4.829565217391305

8285280,5,B001BYLFFS,This is one of the best I have seen. I know many of the arguments have changed on evolution now because of the flaws the scientist in this documentary revealed. It is hard to recognize what is neutral anymore it seems left vs right but I love this video because it seems as close to neutral as you can get. It seems even more fitting this year to be reviewing this as four more countries have come out denouncing global warming as a hoax created by the world super powers to take your money.
