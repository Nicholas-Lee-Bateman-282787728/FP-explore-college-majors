2712200,5,B000LPS47K,"Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in the United States, and kudos to John Carpenter for tackling it head-on. I have read reviews on various message boards objecting to ""Masters of Horror"" episodes with a political point of view (esp. Joe Dante's ""Honecoming""). What is art if not an expression of the artist's viewpoint? ""Pro-Life"" is filled with irony: in instilling ""pro-life"" values in his sons and in carrying them out himself, {SPOILERS!} Dwayne Burcell is actually promoting pro-death values as he turns his sons into killers and carries out cold-blooded murder in the name of his beliefs. It is Angelique, who demands the abortion, who actually carries out God's will. Her father and brainwashed brothers take innocent lives in quite gory and shocking scenes. Network TV series have traditionally tried to present both sides of controversial issues. That is not art, but playing it safe. ""Masters"" doesn't play safe. BTW, I own a fur coat but loved Argento's ""Pelts.""",1174089600,6,984,5.080246913580247

A young girl, Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), who claims to be impregnated by something other worldly, is taken to a nearby abortion clinic. The girl's religious father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman) who has a history with the clinic and is ordered to keep away, is in hot pursuit and is convinced he has strict orders from God to make sure the birth is not aborted. Armed and with the help of his brainwashed sons, Dwayne, breaks in, with the intent of killing anyone who gets in the way of his divine mission.

I was pleasantly surprised by this episode. Although it is inferior to Carpenter's entry of season 1 ""Cigarette Burns"", this installment has a few unexpected surprises. Many seem to have a problem with this film's message and/or theme. I on the other hand do not care if it is meant as a commentary or not. As long as it delivers as a horror film and keeps me entertained then all is good. Unlike Season 1's ""Homecoming"" which had a lot to say but failed miserably as a horror movie, this one delivered on most parts.

One of my biggest complaints lies with the gore effects. I am not a fan of CGI in horror films but I can forgive it when it's well done and used in a fantasy element but I absolutely loathe CGI gore effects. No matter how hard it tries, it does not look real and you never get the same effect had it been done old school. Some of the gore in this episode was clearly CGI and therefore the impact was immediately lost. My other complaint was with the birthing scene. There was a build-up to that birthing scene and although I would have preferred the baby not be shown at all (more on this a little later), Carpenter could have delivered a more effective, more fantastic mutant newborn, one that would at least shock and repel. What we got looked like something right out of Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and nowhere near as fantastic. When finally revealed, the evil spawn was a plastic looking cockroach with a glued on baby doll head and was as frightening and as threatening as my niece's crippled miniature Lhasa Apso. In this case, I would have preferred Carpenter went the ""Rosemary's Baby"" route and not show the baby at all. The baby's daddy on the other hand was brilliantly ferocious and made a heck of an entrance. Despite one great looking demon, this is where I was torn. The film starts of as a thriller, all is implied but nothing fantastical is shown, and the mass shootings despite the CGI gore, is frightfully real, then, the Devil decides he wants to visit its newborn. I was surprised it didn't show up with a bottle of champagne and cigars. I would have preferred they kept the tone as it was originally set. There was no need to turn it into a cheesy Sci-Fi-Fantasy with creatures galore. Depite this little set back, this horror tale did keep me disturbed if only for a moment and there is one torture scene that is truly unpleasant. As far as the performances go, Ron Perlman is noteworthy. He played the part of a religious fanatic who thinks he's doing Gods will very convincingly and his menacing physique was effective. The rest of the cast is not as memorable.

Overall, this episode delivers as a horror film. When compared to Carpenter's earlier, far superior entry ""Cigarette Burns"" you would never guess it was the same director but you can say the same thing if you compare his ""Halloween"" to ""Prince of Darkness"". If you don't expect much, this may please and as an hour long time waster, there is a lot going on here to keep you interested.",1258243200,,3507,4.518110236220473
2712212,3,B000LPS47K,"John Carpenter's bloody gore-fest involving  a girl, Angelique, who is raped by a demon and wants an abortion  She happens to run into two people who happen to work at an abortion clinic who happen to have a court order against her father for some vague reason.

Yes, the plot is thin, but the blood flows as a doctor gets shot up and tortured and an evil man and his three sons perform blood and mayhem in God's name.

I think what made up for the thin plot was the overacting of the players as they confronted each other with their own personal problems, none of which mattered as each got their brains splattered across parking lots.

Does blood really churn out like that with a bullet to the jugular?  A little too gory for my taste, thus the three star average.

So bad it's good Halloween marvel.

2712213,4,B000LPS47K,"Okay, so I've seen quite a few episodes of Masters Of Horror and to tell you the truth 95% are not that great. But I really liked this one, I don't know what it is about it but I liked it. I see allot of folks didn't care for it but hey, everyone is different.

Anyhow a young girl gets impregnated by a demon and goes to have an abortion except her father and brothers think it's a child from god and try to force her to keep it. Of course she tries anyways because she knows the truth about it so her crazy father chases her to the clinic, which by the way is like a small fortress. So she gets in an her father becomes angry and from there insues gun battles, demon babies, torture and the one thing I didn't like, the ending.

If you must know about it, the girl has the baby which is like a spider/baby, the demon which impregnated her shows up and just when you think things are gonna get better it doesn't. You see the demon baby gets killed but yet the demon does nothing about it and walks off like a sad kid who lost it's dog. Maybe they ran out of time and that's the best they could do being that there only hour long episodes but damn, you could've done better than that. I guess that's what you'd expect from John Carpenter who has made a few garbage movies in his time. Besides the ending it was a good little episode, whether you like it or not is up to you, oh and by the way I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars not four.",1231545600,4,1434,3.9756944444444446
2712214,1,B000LPS47K,"A 15 year old girl gets impregnated by the devil when he comes up from underground one lazy summer night and pulls her down into hell for some rough sex. One morning while running in the woods she is nearly hit by a car whose two occupants happen to be on their way to work at the local women's clinic. They take her in to see if she is okay from the accident and then find out that she is with child. Soon the clinic is invaded by her father a God fearing, gun loving, and abortion hating madman played by Ron Perlman. He is not the only problem as they soon find out that the child's father may in fact be the devil himself. The staff and other patients at the hospital are caught in the middle of a deadly war between the two dads. The violence and special effects in this movie are very gross and very graphic. The spider baby is especially gross to look at and when the devil finally appears his scaly body and horns are a bit much. Either way this film sucks it doesn't look or have any of the fun you expect from a Carpenter film. To say that Ron Perlman gives the best performance isn't saying much as the actress playing his daughter is terrible and the doctors barely keep a straight face saying their lines. Carpenter says in the making of that he considers the Perlman character a hero I certainly would not go that far. He tries to legitimize this film by telling the tale of a deeply religious man who has brainwashed his kids into blindly following him on a mission to save his daughter their sister by killing innocent people and then at the end after so many people have lost their lives raising the question if it was as God had wished it or if he had been listening to the wrong God.

Im guessing he wrote this is 30 mins for a quick buck. the plot isn't evening worth being described as B movie-esque or mocking or a throw back to.

Pro-life Dad and brothers show up and--like all good Christians would, shoot people--blood sprays, brains splatter.

2712218,3,B000LPS47K,"Legendary horror maestro John Carpenter returns to Masters of Horror, and re-unites with his Cigarette Burns writers Drew McWeeny and Scott Swan for Pro-Life.  The story involves the teen daughter (Caitlin Wachs) of an anti-abortion activist (Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman) who seeks refuge at a secluded abortion clinic, claiming the baby she's carrying is that of the devil himself.  As her father and his three sons attack the clinic guns blazing, two doctors (Mark Feurstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) are caught in the middle, and soon come to realize that the girl's pregnancy is not of this world.  What could have been a rousing, satiric play on religious fanatiscism instead becomes an almost schlocky shock fest, and by the time of the ""birthing"" scene, Pro-Life gets to the point of being more funny than anything else.  That being said, Pro-Life is still a decent Masters of Horror episode that doesn't live up to its potential, particularly the lame closing scene.  Flaws aside though, KNB once again offer up some great makeup effects work, Carpenter manages to weave some very creepy scenes (such as the revenge on the doctor), and Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast are actually pretty good.

There's some topical social commentary here about abortion clinics and the pro-life debate, but all that gets tossed out the window the moment the demon in the rubber suit shows up. I don't know how deliberately campy John Carpenter wanted to take the final act, but it's disappointing given the forty minutes of strong buildup prior.

2712233,4,B000LPS47K,"""Pro-Life"" of the Masters of Horror series... Oh dear, how much can be said about this one.  The story focuses on a teenage girl being taken to an abortion clinic, demanding she have her baby aborted. Why is she in such a hurry, you ask? Well, because the father of her baby is a demon, or perhaps Satan. It's never stated if the father is the Devil or just a demon, but you get to see the ""father"", so you be the judge. Anyway, the main obstacle for this girl is that HER father (played excellently by Ron Perlman) is pro-life, and a very serious christian. Well, the demon speaks to the father, telling him to ""protect the baby"", which he assumes is God telling him. So, he and his three sons break into the abortion clinic and start shooting everything that moves, which is apparently what God would want. The climax of the episode is the the Demon/Satan emerging from Hell into the abortion clinic to retrieve his son. I reccomend this for Carpenter fans, and fans of Ron Perlman. I don't reccomend this for anyone who leans strongly toward pro choice OR anti abortion, because well, this film won't change your mind, and will probably just offend you.

2712234,5,B000LPS47K,"Pro-Life is a horror movie about a girl who is raped by the devil and wants an abortion.  The catch is, she has an uber-right-wing Christian pro-life father who, once he finds out his daughter is in the abortion clinic, does anything and everything to get her out.  This movie deals with a very touchy subject.  It definitely has a pro-choice slant, as it portrays the father character as a completely psychotic idiot who shoots and kills anyone in his way throughout the entire film.

Pro-Life is not for everyone.  Real-life pro-life supporters will be outraged, while only a small number of pro-choicers will be too disgusted by the subject matter to enjoy this story.  That being said, I enjoyed it, but I can totally see other peoples' points of view and how they may feel about the subject matter.  I have to say, though, that compared to some of the other Masters of Horror series, this one IS one of the best as far as story, effects, gore, and direction are concerned.

The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and looks great.  As with all the MOH series, there are tons of extras on this disc that make it a great buy for a small price.

In Pro-Life this master is about half-way to his glory days for about forty-five minutes, or so. It might be an imperfect first two-thirds, but its still the best stuff he has done in a while. Yet, then it seems like he just went and ran out of money, because the editing becomes so irritating due to its choppiness, that this awkwardness seems like Carpenter just tries to get the film over and forgets something called ""buildup:"" as the flow in this last block just does not seem clean, despite the film starting out good enough with a pissed off Ron Pearlman of Hellboy fame getting in shootouts with the doctor of the clinic. This is a good action scene, if done somewhat pedestrian, but its still all in fun, not to be taken seriously. While shades of  Carpenter`s latter-day, ""Assault on Precinct 13"" come to mind in the good way, and there's some great `n gross f/x scenes. Yet, the dialogue in the entire film is pretty awful, and the script does not seem to make many good statements on this controversial subject, besides being the backdrop of the story. Yet, this is not where it fails, it falters in the  concluding scenes in which the demon is featured, and this aspect to the story is simply not needed in a plot that should have just concentrated on human horror, and took its time, without rushing to the end credits.

8163343,2,B000LPS47K,"The teenage daughter of a religious militant seeks to have her baby aborted when it's apparently the spawn of Satan.

This episode has alot going for it, but for my money, it has even more going against it. Which is a crying shame, because I really do adore the set-up for this story.

Ah well, let's talk about the good first!
As I mentioned, the basic plot and premise of the episode is fantastic. After being impregnated with a demon, a young girl arrives at an abortion clinic, hoping to eliminate the sinister seed before it can be born. Her devout father and obedient brothers thus go on a rampage to save her and the baby, thinking they're doing the will of God. It's a genuinely clever idea and is flowing with delicious irony. While it's about a very charged and controversial topic, it doesn't seem quite as interested in taking sides as previous MoH entry ""Homecoming"" does, although there is definite commentary on the extremes people will go to for their beliefs. Thankfully, between Ron Perlman's acting and the script, the father character doesn't come off as a belligerent straw-man....for the most part. Whether you agree with his views or not, he seems like a man who genuinely cares for his daughter and his beliefs, though is also very unhinged and merciless. In the hands of another director, writer, or actor, this character could have just been a generic depiction of a violent evangelical pro-lifer; quoting the Bible, in constant righteous fury, and a whole mess of other cliches. The demons that appear towards the end are also great. Some nice practical effects and costumes really make these creatures feel terrifying and real, far more so than if they had been rendered in CGI. If anything, the few scenes with them help show how effective real costumes and props can be over general computer-generated effects.

Unfortunately, the bad aspects of this film are directly tied into what makes it worth seeing.
While the premise is really neat, the pace is just so-so. And though Perlman's character definitely stands out, the rest of the cast is fairly bland and forgettable. Never terrible, aside from an overacting father who apparently hates his daughter (and who serves no real point to the story aside from a gratuitous death scene).

I mentioned before that Dwayne (Perlman), was also a pretty solid antagonist in terms of depth and humanity...until one scene that is. When he catches up to the head doctor (who in an earlier scene kills one of his sons), he takes time to perform an incredibly disgusting and lengthy torture. My problem with this is that Dwayne's whole reason to be there is to rescue his daughter and protect the baby. And yet he takes, like, ten minutes to torment this one character, all the while hypothetically, the abortion could have been going on. It goes against the prime motivation for the character to be there in the first place, and it really takes you out of the movie for a sec.

And those awesome demons? Unfortunately, they suffer from what really kills this episode: the sound.

Throughout the majority of ""Pro-Life"", this constant synthetic droning is played over and over on a loop, and it completely deflates all of the tension in virtually every scene. It's really that bad. And while the soundtrack is definitely the worst in this regard, the creatures don't get off too well either. The big daddy demon always makes a generic ""dragon roar"" that you've probably heard as a stock sound effect in many other shows. And the same roar is used EVERY time it shows up. Just like how the soundtrack drains the tension from the situation, the stock sound effect accompanying the fiendish father makes it seem like a cartoon character. I almost feel like I'd like this whole thing better if I had muted my computer and just watched with subtitles.

Compared to other entries in the MoH series, this one feels the most ""TV-Movie""-y. Something about the way it's shot and paced (as well as that damn soundtrack), makes it feel cheaper than some of the other episodes, even the ones that were technically worse overall. On top of all this, the ending is very flat and anticlimactic.

I really can't help but think that with the same footage, this movie could be salvaged in editing. The torture scene and ending might still be noticeable hiccups, but probably more forgivable. Overall, this one's a bit of a disappointment, especially considering how great John Carpenter's other entry, ""Cigarette Burns"" was. Ultimately, I can't really recommend ""Pro-Life"" myself, but if you think the pros just might outweigh the cons for you, than check it out.

  This movie is a controversial take on abortions, abortion clinics, abortion activism and pro life choice all wrapped up into a small hour long horror movie starring the talented actor Ron Pearlman who portrays abortion activist father who has had run ins with the clinic before, whom is trying to get his daughter back from the clinic because she was taken there after almost being ran over by some doctors that work there.  The daughter desperately wants an abortion of the fetus that she carries inside her, but to her father that would be murder.  After having tried unsuccessfully to get into the abortion clinic to claim his daughter by regular means, he and his sons go psychotic John Rambo on the whole place, killing people to try to get his daughter back.

  Inside however his daughter has only been pregnant for 1 week but she is now at term, and about to have the baby.  it turns out the father was some type of demon, or perhaps even the devil himself had impregnated her, and after the baby is born comes to claim it.

  All in all i really enjoyed this movie, Ron Pearlman i think did a splendid job.  I also did not think the blood effects were that bad, like other reviewers on here.  It must also be remembered that this is only an hour long show for a tv series, it is not going to have jaw bursting storyline and effects of a multi-million dollar movie.  Think of this movie as a really good ""outer limits"" type of show, dealing with modern cultural themes like abortion and abduction and the devil impregnating someone as a back drop.  in these terms it is really good and quite enjoyable.",1295308800,,1640,4.5272108843537415

You know it's a pathetic movie when you keep checking the time to see ""is this piece of crap almost over?""-please don't waste your time or money with this garbage. I have nothing positive to say about this film, and don't want to waste any more time on it.",1292025600,2,384,4.1066666666666665
