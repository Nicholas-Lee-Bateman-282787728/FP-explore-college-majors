2169962,5,B00066FUOY,"This is a fun tape for those times I don't want to work really hard, but feel I have to do some exercise.  I think Richard Simmons has helped me lose a lot of weight and keeps me motivated.  I only wish that David Letterman would get a soul and treat Richard with the respect he deserves.",1193443200,7,288,4.035087719298246
2169963,5,B00066FUOY,"A great way to exercise without the feeling of doing a work out, just moving to the music I grew up with",1390867200,,104,3.772727272727273
2169964,5,B00066FUOY,I just love Richard Simmons. I own just about all his videos. Great music to help you loose weight. LOVE IT!,1385078400,,108,4.190476190476191
2169965,4,B00066FUOY,"I love this workout.  It's fun, effective and seems to fly by.  The music, while not by the original artists, is well done and it really fits the moves Richard Simmons created for this video.  My only two critiques are there are some steps he moves on a bit too quickly from so the first few times you do the workout, you tend to miss step on some of the routines (which is fine as long as you keep moving) and that it's not available on DVD, at least not to my knowledge.  If I could get this on DVD, I'd be a happy camper.",1366156800,,524,3.961904761904762
2169966,5,B00066FUOY,It was fun and i sweat alot. some of the songs the moves fast pace i have 2 learn but if it easy no one will want to do it !  good songs to. i will keep using.,1343520000,2,159,3.1842105263157894
2169967,5,B00066FUOY,"This exercise tape is filmed in Richard Simmons' house on his birthday.  It includes oldies, disco, county, and reggae music.  Although it was really hard for me to learn the steps to the country song, Cotton Eyed Joe, I did learn it and this tape gives me a terrific and energizing 60 minute aerobic workout.  I return to this tape again and again.  If you love Richard Simmons, as I do, you'll really love this tape.",1322265600,11,418,4.4605263157894735
2169968,3,B00066FUOY,"The Groovin' In the House video is a lot of fun, it goes by really fast. Unfortunately, the quality of the video I purchased was supposed to be brand new, but there were spots in it that were worn out. It has lines going through it, and you cant see what's happening on the video.",1287360000,,280,4.109090909090909
2169969,4,B00066FUOY,"Groovin' in The House is a great tape.  Just wish it was available on DVD.  My VHS copy got distorted so I just recently ordered a new VHS version of it.  Hopefully it will be in good condition.  The moves are hard to learn at first but after about 5 tries I was able to keep up with the moves on the video.  I love the music on this tape: Hot Stuff, Hot Hot Hot, Jive Talkin', Cotton Eye Joe, Happy Together, the Beat Goes On, Dancing On the Ceiling, Turn the Beat Around, Dream a Little Dream of Me and Philadelphia Freedom.  The people in the video are having so much fun that I laugh everytime I do this video.  This is a great video for those days I can't get outside to walk or jog and is also a great way to start my day.",1278806400,,728,3.9115646258503403
2169970,4,B00066FUOY,"Good songs, kind of a neighborly feel, like your friends are coming over to dance and party.",1234483200,2,92,4.470588235294118
2169971,2,B00066FUOY,"Although I do love Richard Simmon's workouts (with the exception of the Sweatin to the Oldies and the Dance Blastoff series), this one did not appeal to me.  Although, I realize some of this is due to my taste in a workout, the workout does not seem structured enough for me.  At times, they wander around and seem to ""wing it"".  I'm not a ""wing it"" type person; I have to know what I am doing at all times of the exercise or I get discouraged.  While this may be right up your alley, I did not care for it.  If you are like me, and like a more structured workout, I did like Richard Simmon's Blast Off, Broadway Blast Off, Tone & Sweat (uses toning cords), Tone Up On Broadway (uses Chest/Arm stretching cords),
Tonin Uptown (uses Richard Simmon's Tonin cords), Tonin Downtown (uses Tonin cords), Blast & Tone (uses weights, light pair and heavier pair), and Love To Stretch (uses Simmons Stretchin' Strap).",1201737600,5,908,4.4787878787878785
2169972,2,B00066FUOY,"I did not care for this tape.  The exercises and activity were a little too unstructured for me.  I like to have specific exercises and moves to follow, and at times, they seem to ""wing it"". That may not bother some people, but it made it difficult for me.  I like exercises that are easy to follow, and while I did like the premise of the tape, and love Richard Simmons, this tape just didn't meet my needs.",1201392000,2,408,4.205128205128205
8039300,5,B00066FUOY,"This workout program got me moving so swift and so hot, I have yet to put it down. I love the renditions of the songs including Happy Together, Hot Hot Hot and Dancing On The Ceiling. I love Richard Simmons and his programs to work out to. I have already did this one twice. It is amazing,",1506643200,,289,4.087719298245614
8039301,4,B00066FUOY,"It takes a few times of doing the video to not feel lost in the moves, so don't get discouraged.  It's a great video and a great workout!",1433980800,,137,3.892857142857143
8039302,3,B00066FUOY,"This is not the best of Richard's videos. I enjoy a variety of exercise moves and not too much repetition, but because of how the camera panned to different people at inopportune times, there were times when it was hard to know what moves I was supposed to be doing at all. I still use the video, though, and the people on it make me laugh, which is something I love about Richard's videos.  There is one move that I can't really stand to look at, however, because when Richard does it, it looks kind of lewd.  I hate to say that, because I love Richard, but it just makes me feel very uncomfortable. I'd try one of the Sweatin' to the Oldies if you're looking for a great exercise video.",1422489600,2,688,4.244274809160306
8039303,5,B00066FUOY,It came sooner then expected and it was perfect. Good experience,1420329600,,64,4.909090909090909
8039304,5,B00066FUOY,I love this exercise video!  Shame that I cannot find it on DVD,1413849600,,63,3.8461538461538463
8039305,3,B00066FUOY,"Got this video after to use with my six year old while home on maternity leave (after having my second baby). I thought it would be simple and easy for my daughter to follow. It isn't.  Although Richard's kindness and gentle soul shines through as always, we could use a little more instruction before the moves.",1407628800,,312,4.571428571428571
8039306,5,B00066FUOY,"One of my favorite Richard Simmons workout, I lost a lot of weight but I only wish I could get in DVD format.",1405555200,,109,3.782608695652174
8039307,4,B00066FUOY,A different format but good dancing. I have a problem with the VHS in that it skips in certain parts. Not sure if I could replace it for one that doesn't skip?,1400284800,,159,4.0
8039308,5,B00066FUOY,"Groovin'in the House is a great workout. But as you know a workout, and also diffrent. But what ever you think it is, you will love it. And your body will love you for doing it.",1397260800,,177,3.9444444444444446
8039309,3,B00066FUOY,"I recently bought this exercise video from the local Goodwill store, and though the music was good and there were other overweight people exercising with normal weight people, I had lots of trouble in the beginning keeping up with everyone on the video.  It seemed like as soon as I mastered the moves a little, they were onto another exercise move.  It got confusing!
I do recommend that anyone who buys this exercise video to watch it a couple times before actually exercising to it, so you can watch their exercise moves and be able to do them easier.  Otherwise, its a good exercise video for anyone.",1395964800,2,604,4.626168224299065
