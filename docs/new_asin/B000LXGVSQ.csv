This appears to be Rampal's first movie, since the credits say ""Introducing Arjun Rampal"" (However, it seems a different movie got released first so this is his second released film) He is surprisingly good in it considering some massive story problems. It's not a half bad movie actually.

But I must warn you -- maybe warn isn't the right word. Someone involved with this movie has a water fetish that involves Arjun Rampal and to that person, I give a heartfelt thank you. We get Arjun Rampal frolicking in all kinds of water. Rainwater, ocean spray, waves, underwater, waterfalls, rivers, fake perspiration, an oasis.

At least twice he is shirtless! and for some time he is wearing a shirt that is mostly rags. There is a very very strange dream sequence when he pees his pants. I am not kidding. Some of the water frolicking is in Rampal-worshipping slo-mo so again, thank you, you twisted freak whoever you are.

I envy the person who had the job of spritzing Rampal with water whenever they needed more fake sweat which was a lot. This movie was beautifully filmed. Really. Especially when the shots involved Rampal. There were lots. With water and hair flips and beads of water running down his perfect face and taut muscles and .....

Right, I'm back.

Was there a Plot?

Well, yes, I guess so. But I didn't like it much. Rampal is a lawyer who doesn't practice law because it's all corrupt and no one will help the wrongly accused poor people. He lives at home with his racehorse training father and seems to have an entire suite of rooms for his own use that is at least as big as a regular house. He does some horse training I think, but he doesn't actually have a job.

This stalker girl walks up to him and tells him she loves him and he, wisely, manages a weak smile and backs slowly away from the crazy girl. Only, it turns out she's the love of his life after all and they agree that they will mutually support each other no matter what and if they don't the punishment is death. But they don't get married.

Then he wants to start this legal aid society in order to defend innocent poor people but that takes money which he does not have and he is unable to convince anyone one to donate to an endowment. So he gets the brilliant idea that he will rob a bank to fund his Legal Aid Society. Genius! And it's all OK because he's doing it for the innocent poor people. Stalker girl, however, is unconvinced his plan is a good idea and tries to talk him out of it. This, he points out, is in violation of their mutual support agreement and you know what that means, right? (He might, possibly, be crazier than Stalker girl.)

On the morning of the big heist he gets to the bank only to find the place swarming with armed guards. Someone, a female someone, has called in a warning. The bank heist cannot take place as planned.

The next thing you know Stalker girl is dead and he's defending himself in his murder trial. He gets off, believe it or not, and then we learn that he did kill stalker girl because she betrayed their pact only THEN he finds out it wasn't her that called in the tip -- she did not betray their pact and he is really really sad. The end.

Seriously. (OK, I am leaving out a couple of plot points so as not to totally spoil things.)

The Take Away
This is an Arjun Rampal water fetish film. Watch it.",1318032000,3,3371,4.38301282051282
8164820,4,B000LXGVSQ,"Moksha is a classial example of an Indian movie that lacks originality and attempts to show a sequence of events in a Hollywood style. The movie is basically about a law graduate (arjun rampal) who studied law because of his passion towards helping those who cannot help themselves. Money was never an incentive for him to practice law. This dogma of life caused problems between him and his father (oberoi) because his father was a money motivated person and resented his son for his way of thinking. Further into the movie, he meets and falls in love with a naive, vulnerable but good looking young girl (manisha) and they begin to spend a lot of time together. Eventually, he begins to confide in her. After witnessing injustice at a local village where several impoverished people underwent a momentous amount of suffering, he decides to open up a charity foundation for the poor and needy. However acknowledging the need for funding, he explores all possible ""legal"" avenues but fails to get the funds. Even his father turns his back on him. This compels him to use illegal methods to obtain the required funds and during the course of doing so, he begins to turn insane. So thats the plot of the movie. The problem with this movie is that it mimics the Hollywood style of direction (i.e. the black and white flashbacks and the obscure dream) and overall seems very illogical. The plot however was very good in my opinion, but unfortunately, the movie failed to demonstrate it effectively.",1302220800,,1494,4.794573643410852
