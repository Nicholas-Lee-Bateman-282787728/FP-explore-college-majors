8650081,1,B00JDUFMVA,"You should know that I personally created this uncut, widescreen version of Cathy's Curse (a film that is in the public domain).  It was a rush job, and I did it just for fun, because I enjoy this little film and wanted a complete version.  It was NEVER intended to be sold.  The quality isn't the greatest, but it contains scenes from the French version that are not present in the English version - there is no English audio for those scenes, so they are included in French without subtitles.  (If I knew French well enough to make subtitles, I would have done so.)

Anyway, somebody downloaded my version of the film and is now profiting off of it through Amazon's DVD made-on-demand and instant video program.  Please do NOT be suckered into paying for this - you will feel cheated.  I just wanted everyone to know that if you purchase this DVD or download it through Amazon, you are supporting a dishonest person who put no effort into this release whatsoever.",1404691200,17,965,4.575581395348837
8650082,1,B00JDUFMVA,"This version constantly jumps in audio during every scene from English to a dubbed foreign language!
It's nothing to do with the 'uncut' scenes and happens right from the beginning.
I have this film on video, which incidentally has better picture quality than this transfer, and there is no reason why from the very beginning the audio should change to a dubbed audio.
If you own this on video and have transferred it to digital then avoid this version.
Completely pointless.",1402272000,5,475,4.8765432098765435
