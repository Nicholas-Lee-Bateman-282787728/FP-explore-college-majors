8325978,3,B00102F61U,"I bought this DVD set without really knowing what it contained since there is no description of its contents here.  I thought that being the ""Ultimate Retospective"" it would contain extensive documentary footage together with commentary and analysis by various experts as they looked back on the war in ""retrospect""...  Wrong!  This is actually a collection of U.S. military produced documentary films that were made during or shortly after the war.

Needless to say, there is a definite bias to these films.  ""Propaganda"" might be an appropriate word for it, but I think that it does provide valuable insights into those times for serious students.  For example, in volume 2, the first segment - the narrator tells the viewers that to help the troops on the ground fight an unseen enemy in the thick foliage, friendly aircraft come to their aid by spraying a ""harmless"" herbicide over the jungle...

I wasn't really looking for something like this, but it seems like a quality and useful collection of U.S. military Vietnam films.  So it's a keeper.  However, I am taking away one star for the misleading title and box cover, and another star for not including any details or a short documentary about this particular collection of films to help place them in the right historical context.",1213833600,7,1290,4.935185185185185
