788336,5,6304097808,The movie is awesome. I really enjoyed the ending where the family is in there 1980 dodge minivan and they are driving 200mph and just happen to always stay right ahead of the tornadoes.,1084752000,8,186,4.5
788337,1,6304097808,"This is not a good Tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination. The worse thing about the film is the horrible, unconvincing special-effects! The scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking ""It's coming closer!"" is badly done and also Dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest. I know, however, a guy named Mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible B-grade movie (Actually F-grade) If you want a good, entertaining tornado movie that doesn't include bad acting, bad ""Special"" FX, bad script and dumb actors check out ""Twister""",1035244800,4,741,4.84251968503937
788338,5,6304097808,"Night of the Twisters is one of the best films I've ever seen. The performance from the lovely Devon Sawa (Dan Hatch) is fantastic. My dad's not really one to actually sit and watch any film all the way through, but he did with this film which made my day! It's basically about a boy called Dan and his best friend Arthur (Amos Crawley) who get trapped inside Dan's house during a horrific tornado storm, and have to get Dan's baby brother and themselves to the safety of the basement. After the twister's over, Dan and Arthur set out on a journey to find Arthur's sisters and Dan's step-father, Jack (John Schneider), grandma and mother, and try and all get to the safety of a medical centre in the town before they get hit by another twister. If you can't buy this film, then I recommend you rent it a few times, cos this is one film with indredible effects which are worth seeing!",1013385600,25,883,4.390243902439025
788339,3,6304097808,"Although the effects in this movie were excellent, it's hard for a  survivor of ""The Night of The Twisters"" to excuse the film  makers. They changed the name of Grand Island to Blainsworth. Hall county became Gault county, and our flat, nearly treeless town became the hilly, tree-filled Ontario countryside. What's more, June 3 (the middle of 'tornado season') was switched to October. Why? Ivy Ruckman wrote this story to honor the  residents who bravely survived and rebuilt Grand Island after the storm.  Seven tornados swooped down on Grand Island over an astonishing three hour period. Enjoy the movie, but do a internet search for ""The Real Night of The Twisters""!",960508800,3,671,5.018018018018018
788340,4,6304097808,"I am compelled to watch this movie a couple or three times a year, especially in the spring and summertime.  Although I have lived in Arizona for 16 years, there are some times when I still feel a great need to  ""re-experience"" my Iowa/Nebraska roots.  ""Night Of The  Twisters"" helps me to do some of that.  This movie immediately  provokes in me the old sudden and conflicting feelings of foreboding and  wild, thrilling, dismiss school early, party-like anticipation that any  change in the summer weather, abrupt or gradual, can produce in those of us  who have lived most of our lives in the Mid-West.  Family love and  misunderstandings, community caring and resourceful action, and realistic  tornado effects, combine in this movie to provide the viewer with start to  finish suspense.  There are many tornado movies, each with their element of  intrigue.  But none can compare with ""Night Of The Twisters"" for  a real glimpse of the emotional and physical devastation, shock, and  courage of the average resident on tornado alley eventually being  ""hit"" after being passed over the previous times.",959904000,2,1104,5.033333333333333

7862455,4,6304097808,"Night of the Twisters is based on the true story of a weather phenomenon in Grand Island, Nebraska back in 1980 when seven tornadoes touched down in one night. The acting and storyline is cheesy but I think the twisters shown in this film look more realistic than ones used in movies today. To people who think this movie is a ripoff of the movie Twister, this movie was made first back in the 90's! I love the suspense and sentamentality of this film. It's something you can watch with your kids and not worry about language or violence.",1365897600,3,538,4.444444444444445
