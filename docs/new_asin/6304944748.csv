940377,3,6304944748,"This is a charming ""real people"" story.  I think it will do well for the 6-10 year olds.

Great for letting children""s imaginations run and certainly sparks creativity!",1167782400,3,168,4.964285714285714
940378,5,6304944748,"This is a good video for motivating children to look more closely at the natural world surrounding them.

A young girl, Kristen, and her artist aunt go to an island in Maine so that her aunt can paint illustrations for her book.  Kristen discovers fairy houses, which are simple, all natural constructions made for fairies.  She makes several, and then observes them regularly for signs of fairies.  She sees many signs of animal life, not fairy life.  At the very end, however, there are signs of - well, you decide!

My children of course wanted to make their own fairy houses, which apparently naturalists now discourage on this particular island in Maine, but I have not stopped my children from picking up bark, twigs, fallen leaves and stones, and propping them up against the base of a tree to make their own fairy houses, particularly in our own yard.

The book is a nice companion to the movie.",1135987200,12,903,4.677215189873418
940379,5,6304944748,I loved this movie.  It was a good bed time movie.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought my own.,1069372800,9,94,3.4285714285714284
940380,3,6304944748,"What a wonderful story! An inspiration for artists, children and lovers of nature of all ages! Watch the video first, and read the story after. A great idea for lesson plans for literature, art classes, environmental science, etc. Simple effects make it a great inspiration for everyday artful living, birthday parties and more. Thanks to Tracy Kane for this experience in spirit.",1038700800,15,380,5.145161290322581
940381,5,6304944748,"As a preschool teacher, I found Kristen's Fairy House to be a delightful video that worked well into other class activities. The children had a wonderful time making their own fairy houses -- using only materials from nature. And what a great way to introduce nature studies! We also raised and released butterflies like in the video.",971136000,13,334,4.87719298245614
940382,5,6304944748,"I love this video! It's nice to find a children's movie that isn't filled with action and adventure. It is a good bedtime movie, because it is so  quiet and gentle. My six-year-old sister loved it, and wished she was  Kristen. Even though I am older than the targeted audience, I love it too!  I like to watch it with my sisters before we go to bed. My favorite scene  is the part where Kristen and Tracy dance to ""The Nutcracker""  music and twinkling Christmas lights. This is a very beautiful movie, and  although it may not exactly be edge-of-your-seats entertainment,  ""Kristen's Fairy House"" is well worth the money.",966816000,55,621,4.6422018348623855
940383,5,6304944748,"As long as you have the proper expectations, you'll love this video.  No flashy special effects; just a gentle story about appreciating nature from an artistic point of view, with a nice music soundtrack.  Nothing to scare  the little ones, which doesn't mean your older kids won't like it.  Both of  my kids (8 year old daughter and 11 year old son) and I enjoyed it.",952300800,27,368,4.515151515151516
940384,5,6304944748,"I bought this video based on the description.  My 3yr old girl LOVES it.  It is one of those over and over videos with her.  It is a calming video and has great nature shots. Kristen goes to an island in Maine on a boat  with her aunt.  It is in a lighthouse setting.  They go to a woods and  every day Kristen adds to her own fairy house of natural twigs and such.  Since I am ""single"" I appreciate that Kristen is enjoying an  experience with her aunt and not a parent figure.  It is an adventure to  Kristen and it captivates my daughter's focused attention.  I am always  called to dance with her when the scene with lights and dancing to the  Sugar Plum Fairys comes on.  It is an off the beaten trail video worth  having.",949795200,13,727,4.122302158273381
940445,5,6304944748,"Having visited Maine a couple of times and seen fairy houses in the woods, this was a wonderful way to share those experiences with our young grandchildren!",1339459200,,156,4.814814814814815
940446,3,6304944748,"This video is okay.  It is nice to see a peaceful, wholesome movie for kids.  But the filming could have been much better.  It was very grainy, skipped around a lot, and most scenes lacked a clear focal point.  It could have been very beautiful, but what I got most from the filming was how bad the ozone problem is in Maine.  The storyline was a little weak as well.",1337212800,2,367,4.185714285714286
940447,4,6304944748,"I love the video, it is a VHS.  I think it would be worth looking at the DVD, for quality of the picture.  I love the fairy house ideas and artist's story.",1256428800,,155,3.8125
940448,5,6304944748,"This is a great little show for anyone wanting to encourage kids to get OUTSIDE!  The scenery is beautiful, and it's appropriate for just about any younger kids.  Older kids and teens may find it a bit hokey (they'd be far too cool) but this adult enjoyed it.",1238976000,,259,4.375
940449,5,6304944748,Wonderful video for those people of all ages who believe in magical things and places.,1221609600,,86,4.8
940450,5,6304944748,"My six year old daughter LOVES this movie, and is now enthralled with building fairy houses in our backyard. She ""collects nature"" wherever she goes to add to her stash of building supplies!  However, after her initial viewing of the movie she was in tears because no real fairies ever showed up to live in the house Kristen made. I was disappointed, because I had wanted her to love it and have a good experience.  After her initial shock and sadness wore off, she loved it.  But if I had it to do over, I would prepare her ahead of time. If you have a sensitive or overly imaginative child, you may want to make it clear up front, before she watches it, or during the movie, that no real fairies will show up to live in the house!",1207094400,2,732,4.251798561151079
940451,5,6304944748,I purchased this for my little Twin Granddaughters and oh truth be told..for myself :o)  I love fairy story books and movies and this one was a real joy to watch with them...we all loved it and are now planning on making our own little Fairy House in the garden this summer.,1207094400,,274,4.269230769230769
940452,5,6304944748,"Kristen's Fairy House is a beautiful movie for little girls -- it emphasizes the magic in nature itself.  The scenery is lovely.  We are taking a trip up to Maine to one of the islands where fairy houses are commonly built, and this movie really got our girls excited about it.",1191110400,,277,4.411764705882353
940453,4,6304944748,"We heard about fairy houses about 5 years ago and started in small ways around our *very* suburban home.  My 7, 4 and 2 1/2 year old sat still in front of the tv watching this entire video(which is rare).  We have always associated them with fairies and not butterflys, however.  I was somewhat saddened that my 7 year old began to feel that fairies weren't real but I was hopeful again at the end of the movie when they all ran outside to build a new fairy house in the rain.  They all even put on their fairy wings to build it!  So even though they were familiar with the idea, it still sparked their imagination.  The Rainbow Fairy book series by Daisy Meadows  may also be a nice way to continue the idea for an early reader.",1186444800,,729,4.201438848920863
940454,4,6304944748,"From a video standpoint, it's a bit amateurish, but that kind of lends an extra sense of innocence to the story.

My daughter, who is quite taken with fairies at the moment, thought it was wonderful.

Since watching the film, she's wanted to be outdoors more and find places to build fairy houses out of sticks and leaves and other natural objects.

That's a welcome (if temporary) switch from the world of glittery princesses.

My husband and I appreciated the beautiful Maine scenery.

I would have given it 5 stars but I thought it was a bit expensive.",1170720000,5,555,4.622448979591836

7879566,5,6304944748,"Charming story!  I can't get my 3 year old niece out of the flower beds and I have to check every evening and reclaim my tablespoons!  She's normally grumpy when she first wakes but now she jumps out of bed to check her fairy houses to see who's visited.  It, along with some little fairy figures were the perfect birthday gifts.",1399334400,,329,4.360655737704918
7879567,5,6304944748,"This story seems to be a documentary but really follows more of a narrative structure, telling the story of a young girl tagging along with her aunt who is a children's book illustrator and author.  They explore the island together, which is home to a great number of fairy houses made by visitors over the years.  as Kristen works on her own fairy house, her aunt works on her next book. The companion story book, ""Fairy Houses"" is the result of this research trip and is certainly worth a read.

Some of the moments seem too staged for it to be a true documentary - such as Kristen finding fairy dress up clothes under the bed and putting them on to cheer up her aunt who experienced a setback in her book project.  Who's filming this anyway? However this doesn't really detract from the charm of a story that is fascinating for all ages.  My girls love the ""Little Travelers"" documentaries, and Kristen's Fairy House is similarly a fantastic choice for kids who find Disney and Pixar too scary, or parents who find mainstream entertainment inappropriate. It will probably inspire some outdoor projects too!",1373760000,2,1109,4.695876288659794
7879568,5,6304944748,"Kristen's Fairy House sparked the imaginations of my two little granddaughters. After reading it with them, they went right outside to construct their own.

7879569,4,6304944748,"This is a sweet little movie that is of course suited for children.  I collect children's books for their illustrations so thought this might be inspiring as well.  It is a cute story about an aunt and her niece going on vacation and creating fairy dwellings together.  The aunt, who is also the producer of the movie, sketches and works on her book throughout.  It is because of this that it became a bit shameless in self promotion and that was a distraction for me. I think it would have been better to have given the gift of sharing fairy dwellings, the relationship between aunt and niece and left the self promo and ""advertising"" out, or maybe just inserted it at the end. I think it was beautiful to see the aunt drawing the little girl though.",1360972800,,751,4.45985401459854
