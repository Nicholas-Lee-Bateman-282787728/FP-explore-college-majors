7925817,2,B00004X028,"I'm always looking for new educational Jewish media, especially when it comes to the holidays.  Even though our family is orthodox, I teach kids of many denominations so I'm happy to get media from multiple perspectives.  There were definitely some ""classic"" songs on this DVD and the audio only portion of Debbie Friedman wasn't bad but beyond that it was pretty worthless.  The video portion is very dated and the DVD has no real menu structure beyond ""Video presentation"" or ""Audio Presentation"" so it makes it very difficult to pick out a particular skit or part of the program.

The video is broken into different compiled performances but they are all tied together by a recurring stage presentation by 3 very mediocre dancers.  Of course, beyond all the mediocre dancing, singing, and videography, my true complaint is only with the content.  This video essentially removes any semblance of Judaism from the story of Hanukkah.  There is one small ""history"" sketch in there, but it honestly makes it seem like the Greeks were the good guys!?

If you need another cheap video, I guess it's fun to have but if you want something entertaining and educational for Hanukkah , I am much more inclined to recommend ""Lights"" or ""Passover and Hanukkah at Bubbe's"".",1359504000,2,1261,4.915094339622642
7925818,5,B00004X028,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST HANUKKAH VIDEOS EVER MADE! Our entire family loves watching it and most of the time we are also singing & dancing along with all the great songs & dance routines!,1227484800,3,186,4.194444444444445
7925819,5,B00004X028,This movie was the most heartwarming and uplifting film i have ever seen. The acting by the young and talented David Brand is unparralled. I recommend Hanukkah Tales and Tunes to everyone of all ages and religions!,1164585600,,214,4.8108108108108105
7925820,5,B00004X028,"This is very upbeat, my children, ages 3-12, love watching this over and over again-and we don't mind!  It is educational and enjoyable.  The coordination of  the dancing and singing is just wonderful, the skit is funny as well.  I'm so glad something fun exists to explain the basics of Hannukah-we keep singing the songs to ourselves, even when not watching it.",1130976000,4,363,4.806451612903226
7925821,1,B00004X028,"The DVD is truly one of the worst pieces of ""entertainment"" I have ever seen.  Horrendous acting, dreadful songs, and a goblin(???!!!) make this a true affront to the beauty that is Hanukkah and a slap in the face to Jews everywhere.  Resist the bastardization of this sacred holiday and AVOID THIS TRIPE AT ALL COSTS!!!  If I could give it a negative rating I would.",1084406400,14,367,4.53030303030303
