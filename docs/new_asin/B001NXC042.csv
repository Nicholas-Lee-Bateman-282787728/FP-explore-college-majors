8328049,4,B001NXC042,"This movie starts off very slow, the acting is questionable, and it's very low budget. BUT, the story is absolutely worth the watch. To be honest, I was very confused at first. I purchased this thinking it was a horror movie. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! Once I understood what was going on, I was completely impressed with it. This is a touching journey of one little girl's acceptance of her mother's death. It does have some references to Alice in Wonderland, but it is not an actual version of it, nor does it follow the story. But with that said, I still believe this would make an excellent addition to an Alice in Wonderland movie collection. I'm very glad I purchased this to add to my collection.",1395446400,,704,4.465116279069767
8328050,5,B001NXC042,"'Monsterland' is a excellent low-budget feature film that was crafted in Texas away from the over commercialized trappings of Hollywood. Most Hollywood films are over-rated. They often have the large budget, but they lack originality or true inspiration. Hollywood films and large budget films are usually the vision of business executives rather than the vision of a artist or a film maker. 'Monsterland', by Joey Evans and Tristan Vaughan is the kind of movie for people who love true film and not a lot of Hollywood baggage.
  Despite the spooky title,the film is not really a horror film, but a film about loss. It is really just a dream the young Alice experiences after the loss of her mother. The dream does have some spooky images but they are only manifestations of Alice's sense of emptiness and her fear of being alone.
  Any fan of Lewis Carroll should find this film interesting because of the numerous 'Alice In Wonderland' references. The film even has a clip of the rare 1903 'Alice' silent movie by Cecil Hepworth. There are quotes from Carroll's book through-out the film and even a wickedly cute 'Hatter' character called Mr. Hat who keeps appearing to Alice on her television set.
  Some viewers may not understand the very low budget of this production but I feel low budget film making could be the new trend. Especially if they turn out as excellent as this brilliant little film is. Film excecutives believe film and especially fantasy films need a large budget. This film proves them wrong. Another low-budget fantasy that turned out brilliantly is Damion Dietz's incredible 'Neverland', A hilariously foul-mouthed adaptation of Barrie's 'Peter Pan'.
  Viewer beware. These films have very,very low budgets, something not for mainstream taste, but the pay-off of these brilliant films is immense.

8328051,4,B001NXC042,"Despite many reservations, I bought this movie, unsure of what to expect. Granted, it was not the most perfect film, I had ever seen (what film is these days). Still, you really do see the love and effort put into this one. The story is well done and although it starts off slow, the pacing works as it helps you create an understanding of the characters, allowing you to connect and care about them. Particularly the main character. Also, the grainy picture quality and subtle moments (television and closet bits and clips of some really old school films) did wonders to inject a bit of the surreal into this picture. Add to that a good musical score that does not overwhelm the movie and some creative ""fright"" set pieces, and you have a good film that does not rely on the usual tactics of gore and sex that some tend to resort to....",1234224000,3,837,4.477124183006536
