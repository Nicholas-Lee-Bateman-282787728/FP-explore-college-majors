The film begins at dockside where people board a ship. Captain Holling has mental problems and will be relieved of command. Does he need a vacation? Yes, his actions speak for themselves. Downey is the new Captain. The vault opens on radio equipment that will run the ship when it is at sea. Others are listening in. Could radio-controlled battleships have won the World War? [No, most battles were on land.] Who has the combination to that vault? Who attacked Professor Grimson in the dark? Captain Holling escaped from the sanitarium last night. There is an arranged plan to place agents on the ship. The departure of a ship occurs with a ceremony. Holling had been poisoned with a rare drug! Major Pope questions people, we see the conflicts. Miss Ames visits Granny Simpson for some comedy. Did a steward see Captain Holling?

""You can't judge people by appearances alone"" says Major Pope the investigator. Captain Downey is found with a rope around his neck. Who did it? The experiment begins at 9pm. An early version of a facsimile transmission is used to send writing on a cathode-ray tube. The ship is controlled by radio transmissions. Lights out? A shot is fired! They find Captain Holling on board. The equipment was sabotaged by the removal of the S505 tube! The ship is out of control. Strange things happen in the dark. When the lights go back on the villain is revealed for a shocking surprise.

This was adapted from an Edgar Wallace story ""The Ghost of Captain Holling"" (it reminded me of ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd""). A good story makes a good movie. The introduction does not associate the actors with the characters they play. ""Granny Simpson"" has an important role. Was that George ""Gabby"" Hayes with a pistol but without a beard? This movie is like a mystery that takes place in an isolated mansion. Was the part about radio control just a cover story to hide experiments in radio detection and ranging? Control is meaningless without feedback, that is why we'll never see radio-controlled automobiles on local roads.

Electronic synchronization made facsimile transmissions practical in the 1930s (a high-tech gimmick to astound audiences). They were later developed in countries that used icons rather than an alphabet for electronic communications. Mechanical synchronization by clockwork was used for facsimile transmission soon after the telegraph was invented in the 1830s. There was a regular transmission between Lyons and Paris France in the 1860s, until the war of 1870.",1289520000,,2530,4.988151658767772
