Vera Farmiga Is outstanding and real.",1364860800,,131,5.55
8486307,5,B005TK236U,"I was once in a fundamentalist congregation, but happily not as stringent as this one. Certain scenes did serve as flashbacks for me, however. I am ordering this today after having seen some of it on TV last night. Ironically, I am experiencing a similar angst while now in a ""mainstream"" denomination. Some of the challenges of Corrine reminded me of the introspection currently going on within me. In my case, rather than suppression of intellect, there is a suppression of those who are not seminarians or ministers - though the same Holy Spirit resides in each of us with the same potential for guidance. I strongly related to Corrine's attempts to ""share"" and being stifled by leaders. In mainstream I find inconsistencies between The Word of God and Man's Traditions, with the latter seeming to outweigh the former. (Sigh.) One good thing about fundamentalism is the fervent study of God's Word. In mainstream, there seems to be more attention to programs, plans, tradition, egos, everything but the prevailing Word. (Alas.)  I'm getting the film because I'd like to see it all the way through and study her findings and interactions a little closer. Maybe some of my questions will answered.",1359590400,2,1198,4.960199004975125
8486308,4,B005TK236U,interesting and thought provoking.  Odd that it is not available.  We had to search to find it. Used for church group discussion.,1356998400,,129,4.818181818181818
8486309,4,B005TK236U,"This film depicts the religious life of a small seemingly undereducated tightly-knit community of somewhat strange looking men and women. The main focus is on a woman who is married to a man who feels that his child was saved by a miracle and who decides to devote his life to Jesus. He drags his wife into this spiritual life.

The two and their children belong to a church whose pastor and his wife teach simple religious ideas based for the most part of the need to have faith and love Jesus even though it seems that he is not responding to prayers. The woman begins to realize that she is not getting anything out of her faith. We see her struggles and her reactions when a person she loves is not helped by her faith.

The woman is thoughtful, but I understand the film to say that she doesn't resolve her problem. Viewers should look at the film themselves and decide if she finds solace and if so how, and if not why not. It seems to me that she fails because she only focuses on faith and receiving answers to her prayers. She does not delve deeply into what religion really is and is not helped by the simple teachings of her pastor and his associates who would be unable to answer her questions. She decides to read books, but the books that she reads are poetry about love and good novels that tell a lot about life, but each focuses on one aspect and none address why one should be religious, how to do so, what to avoid doing, and the benefits that religion can and cannot produce.",1337644800,,1495,4.316725978647687
8486310,3,B005TK236U,"Higher Ground is not a great movie and not a poor movie.  It is simply about a woman who loses her faith in Jesus.  She can no longer feel the presence of God in her body or in her life.  Though the film is not a blatant attack against Christianity, it does have some messages regarding religion.  Fear is the driving force behind religious belief.  Candy coat it however one may, there are many threats that keep the faithful in line.

Another message is that bad things happen to people regardless of faith.  Bad things happen to good people.  It is a bad event that causes the main character to question her faith, and threats of hell fire (from some of her peers) to try to get her back in line.

The movies depicts religious people as brainwashed zombies who must follow the advice of senior members or suffer the consequences.  Overall, the film was depressing and had no answers regarding faith.  The characters in the film did not seem like happy people.  They were a self-hating fundamentalist group who speak of how they deserve nothing good in life for being terrible people.  God is all good and they are all bad.  In other words, without God they are worse than nothing.

All in all, the film shows how life can be when people are unable to think for themselves.",1335398400,3,1275,4.482608695652174
