8331902,5,B001P32NME,"I had this documentary on VHS from years ago and lost it when converting my tapes to DVD. I was thrilled to find it on disc and watch it again. This is an excellent documentary on not only the dam but conditions in the country that brought about the project and others like it. Excellent narration, very interesting!",1445817600,,316,4.4655172413793105
8331903,4,B001P32NME,I use this DVD in a Pacific Northwest History class to help demonstrate the growth and the importance of the region.  The video fits in the time I have for the class and it keeps the kids attention.  It is a little dated but the overall information is priceless.,1334534400,,262,4.326530612244898
