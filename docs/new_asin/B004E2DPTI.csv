8426416,1,B004E2DPTI,"It was a waste of money getting this set! The rest of the shows were real,real,real,real crummy! I wish that I could get rid of it!",1395792000,,131,4.076923076923077
8426417,4,B004E2DPTI,Bought on a whim really for husband and it's a decent group of laughs. Wish they would just put out all of the shows from one year through them all and let us folks just enjoy all or skip those we aren't so interested in over the years. However I heard that someone is responsible for deleting or destroying 10 complete years of Johnny Carson's tonight show episodes. As in they lost them all. WOW that's got to hurt to go through life having done that and knowing others see you like that every time they look your way. OUCH. We didn't want a full collection ourselves and from what I understand from other reviews is if you buy a few of these less expensive grouped DVD sets you pretty much have what's offered on the more expensive grouped efforts pulled together into one set. Anyway I think he's more funny today than I did in the day.,1381881600,,840,4.322784810126582
8426418,5,B004E2DPTI,This DVD was very entertaining and well worth the money.  My husband bought it for us to enjoy but would be a great gift for someone.,1323388800,4,133,4.115384615384615
