5256561,4,B0093SSC00,"""Eva"" (2011 release from Spain; 94 min.) brings the story of Alex (played by Daniel Brhl). As the movie opens, we see Alex arriving in town, where he is picked up by his brother David. We later learn that Alex had been gone for 10 years. Alex is lured back by the local university to work on an advanced child robot called the S.I. 9. In a parallel story, we get to know Eva, the 10 yr. old daughter of David and Lana. As it happens Lana used to be Alex's girlfriend before he left town 10 yeas ago. Alex wants to work with Eva as an example to fill in the emotional aspects of the S.I. 9. At this point we are 10-15 min. into the movie. Will Alex's old flame with Lana rekindle? Can he use Eva as the guiding light for completing the S.I. 9? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie came out in 2011 and I have no idea why this now, 3 1/2 years later, showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend. That said, better late than never because, as it turns out, this is a little gem of a movie. Why? Several reasons: the premise is original and the mix between the family drama and science fiction aspects works beautifully. In fact, it is amazing yet satisfying that this kind of movie was made in Spain of all places, showing once again that originality trumps big budgets any day of the week. The sci-fi aspects are done wonderfully, without smothering the rest of the movie. Check out Alex's cat or, even better, Alex's personal assistant, a robot called S.I. 7 in the form of an older man. The acting performances are top-notch throughout, none more so from Claudia Vega as the 10 yr. old Eva abut also Marta Etura as Lana (and bearing an uncanny resemblance to Charlotte Gainsbourg). Bottom line: kudos to writer-director Kike Maillo as this is one heck of a movie, and one of the better sci-fi themed movies I've seen in quite a while.

As mentioned, this showed up out of the blue this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was poorly attended (only 2 people besides myself), but what can you expect when there's no marketing, t to mention a 3 1/2 year delay since its original release. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a clever and engaging foreign family drama with a sci-fi twist, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Eva"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1426377600,5,2470,4.379084967320262
5256562,3,B0093SSC00,"...less effective somehow? Well I was expecting something *more* about this EVA (yep, the name is also symbolic LOL!) even if I knew it to be the 1st film from this director: it's been successful at festivals & it's also unusual to have a film like that made in Spain, since it probably looks more ""British"" (plus it features Daniel Bruhl, always a guarantee), but hey anyway it's been a nice movie to have around for a change.
It's more a sort of psychological thriller-melodrama than a real sci-fi movie in my opinion: despite the beautiful Swiss landscape, good cast & the ambitious idea beneath it, regarding what robots might become around 2040, I think it lacks pace & in a certain way ""answers"" as well to the questions it rises. (Besides the director's vintage choice of creating a clone of the '70/80ies for the WHOLE visual look, from glasses to cigarettes, with Bowie's music! it quite bothered me because seemed really filmed in the past instead of in a futuristic era, not even in Prometheus or new Star Wars movies they did it like that, even if they had more ""issues"" trying to link the look of the older films to the new ones of their franchises).

The special effects are good, they seem realistic, but again, it's a film that focuses more on the (soapy) drama of the relationships (but without grounding it to a solid background, which is all off-screen) rather than pure sci-fi: personally i.e. I didn't care as much as the director for the difficult set into the snow as a symbol for ""something else"", he should have developed instead the theme more clearly at least for me to truly feel it. Eva's little actress Claudia, for 1st time on screen is perfect, she's got such a natural charm ""la nina"", the film would have been lost without her for sure.
But if you also add that the basic idea isn't so original after all, & that I did see coming the ""surprise"" early on (Americans did the ""children-robot's tale"" in previous films as A.I., & somehow also Frankenstein told at the core a similar plot), then I'd have wanted something deeper, especially a longer film to explain what happens after the inevitable climax. Rethinking to Scott's similar approach, Blade Runner did have regardless that *poetic spark* missed here.

PS_The dvd is a special edition with 2 discs, 1 has the film in Catalan or Spanish (Castellano) with English subtitles only, plus the director's commentary (only Spanish without any subtitles), the other disc contains the usual backstage things but also the deleted scenes (without subs) of the flashbacks that would have helped to flesh it out more the plot (the 1 about the past of the 3 protagonists is 22 min. long), & last but not least, the alternative finale, that would have changed the whole impact of it (for the record, I still prefer the official 1).",1366416000,5,2806,4.689655172413793
8535398,3,B0093SSC00,"Possible spoilers.  Im always on the lookout for a smart Sci-fi movie and somewhere along the line (probably a trailer that came with a DVD/Blu ray) I came across this Spanish film.  It was actually made in 2011 and after limited success in Europe, came to the U. S. in 2015.  The only actor I recognized was Daniel Bruhl (Captain America: Civil War and Burnt).  He plays Alex Garel, a genius in robotics in a world set in 2041.  He is coming back to his Spanish home after working in Australia for the past 10 years.

In the opening scene we see a woman hanging from a snow covered ledge in obvious dire straits.  A girl of 10 shows up at the door of Alex and faints.  Then the movie starts over with Alex returning to the town he left years earlier.  Obviously we will discover what that opening scene is all about.  We soon learn that Alex had been working on an advanced robot with his brother David (Alberto Ammann) and a woman named Lana (Marta Etura).

The early lingering glimpses and repressed emotions between Lana and Alex make it very obvious that they were once romantically involved.  But now Lana is married to David and they have a 10 year old girl named Eva (Claudia Vega).  Alexs boss at the research university is a woman named Julia (Anne Canovas) and she allows Alex to work on the unfinished robotic project from his deceased parents locked up home.  Alex first job is to find a model for the robot.  That is, a boy who has the right personality traits to program into the robot.  He essentially dismisses all of the boys as being too boring.

On his way home Alex comes across a girl that seems at home playing by herself in a schoolyard.  Alex engages her in conversation from his car.  The first thing Im thinking is what kind of pervert would do this.  In fact the girl calls him just that.  It turns out however that she is Eva.  Only later at dinner at his David and Lanas house does he discover that the girl is his niece.  Against the parents wishes Eva wants to participate in the interview process and Alex agrees but only if it a secret.

While there are some whiz-bang special effects involving gold balls of robotic design that generally just float in mid-air, the film takes a pretty dramatic turn away from the sci-fi element and moves into a relationship between the former lovers.  You would think they both could keep things in check given not only the marriage but the fact that David is Alexs brother.  And of course Eva.  The film is aided by a cute robotic cat and a highly advanced robotic butler named Max (Lluis Homar).  Unfortunately the film telegraphs the surprises, but for the ending.  The film is well made and acted but the story left me wanting.  Note: The version I watched was in Spanish with yellow English subtitles.  Your results may differ.",1499644800,2,2801,4.465483234714004

8535400,5,B0093SSC00,I loved this movie. Wish it had ended differently. Well done.,1477699200,,61,4.636363636363637
8535401,4,B0093SSC00,"Eva is a low budget Spanish film that hit cinemas in 2011, and compare it to budget English language (ie ones made for TV etc) Eva outperforms them, especially in the visual.  The robot cat for one looks pretty cool.  But the film also has its downsides.  I never understand why movies include spoiler scenes at the start, you've already bought your ticket for the cinema or bought/hired the DVD, so it's not like a book that people browse in a shop and read the first couple of pages of before deciding to purchase.  We're shown Eva collapsing after knocking on the door of the film's main character and her mother losing her grip on the top of a cliff and falling to the valley below. The cliff grip scene looked pretty unrealistic too. These were pretty much the only surprises in the storyline which if you've seen any robot movie, you've seen it all before, and seeing the spoiler scenes early added nothing to the film.

The film is both visually enjoyable and with a nice (albeit unoriginal) storyline.  The actress playing ten year old Eva is also quite likable, sometimes kids as title characters can ruin a movie by either poor acting or that there character is simply annoying.  Neither is the case with Eva or Claudia Vega who played her.  There are holes in the plot (so I'll give a spoiler alert here) but you can accept as you've enjoyed the movie anyway.  The major hole in my mind is since the university head lady already knows about Eva, and calls her the same name as the project she has asked the main character to work on (develop a robotic child), what is the whole point of allocating all these resources and money to duplicate something that you know has already worked.  Especially if you're not going to mention Eva to the inventor, who could have worked out her faults and improved on them, if she wanted a better model or something?  Also the whole safety mechanism (probably needing to be there by law) of ""What do you see when you close your eyes?""  Well wouldn't people be saying this all the time, kids to each other in the playground, or people who thought it fun to sabotage robots like vandals and computer hackers do today.  Surely kids at Eva's school would be saying this.  It would make more sense if that was simply a shut down mode but not a terminate the life of the robot mode.

I also wondered if this was one of those films where we weren't supposed to realise Eva was a robot.  It seems odd because even just seeing the DVD front cover makes you assume she is a robot. Like I said if you've seen this genre movies before you'll instantly think that.  Plus when the adult butler/cleaner robot appears that looks like a human, you've got no doubt that technology already exists.  The only thing I thought might have been a twist was that Eva's mother was also a robot.  Perhaps she committed suicide after breaking up with the main character and his brother also having loved her made a robot that looked and acted like her.  But that wasn't the case.",1471651200,,2996,4.482504604051566
8535402,5,B0093SSC00,"This movie was absolutely fabulous, it starts off a little slow in the beginning but it's overall really great and kept me on the edge of my seat. Give it a try it's currently streaming on Netflix in the USA and is worth the watch. I recommend if you like movies about Robots and etc",1464134400,,283,4.163636363636364
8535403,5,B0093SSC00,"Quality comes at times from the least expected sources.  A few years ago, the Spanish sci-fi film ""Abre Los Ojos"" came around.  It was adapted - less appealingly, but with Penelope Cruz retained - as ""Vanilla Sky.""  Another quality Spanish sci-fi film popped up recently: ""Eva.""  It is exceptionally hard to find, which is incredible, considering its slick production values.

""Eva"" is a tragedy, a love triangle between Spanish cyberneticists.  The high-tech elements are well-integrated into the wintry setting, and serve rather than propel the plot.  The story should satisfy sci-fi fans and romantics alike.  Sadly, this DVD release is bare-bones, with no extras whatsoever.  Moreover, it doesn't have subtitles of any kind.  I speak Spanish, but I would have liked the subtitles in order to understand some muttered lines.

The film is so good that it will probably be adapted into a mediocre Hollywood film starring a blas star.  If so, have a copy of the better original as a reference.  And if it isn't adapted, you still should have this film on your shelf.",1454457600,,1066,4.988636363636363
8535404,5,B0093SSC00,A thoughtful and touching film.  Much better than Spielburg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (in my opinion).  I don't understand the lukewarm reviews.  I rate it among the best films I've seen in the last few years.,1453593600,,214,5.057142857142857
8535405,3,B0093SSC00,"It was refreshing to watch this sci fi film, because it approaches its subject --at least on the surface--with seriousness. As the summary explains, a talented scientist returns to work to pick up where he left off ten years earlier to complete a more advanced robot child. The sophistication of the robots, the presence of hand print readers as home devices, and other gadgets alert the viewer that the world he inhabits is more highly developed than our own, but the plot, for all the promise of presenting a new and more complex realm, relies on a trite love triangle that doesn't quite work. We don't know enough about the scientist and the woman he lost to his friend (or brother) ten years earlier to really care enough about them, their lust, their life work,and thus also the events that follow. I agree with the other reviewer that the film suffers from not quite knowing how to effectively manage blending genres (of which there are more than two) and ends up not giving enough attention to any one of them to create a fully successful story. Like his mysterious robotic valet, the real science fiction, is unfortunately kept to the sidelines while the age old sci-fi theme of questioning the true nature of life and our right (and the consequences of attempting) to create it flickers intermittently, to tantalize the viewer throughout the film,like the glimmer of his valet's cybernetic eyes. So much more promising are those unexplored questions (and the character of the valet!) that the story that is unveiled (as though those questions were settled) is ultimately boring. I would give this film 3 and 3/4 stars if I could. It is certainly more than average--the camera work is good; the set is appealing; the actors play their parts well---it had most of the elements to make something really thought-provoking and profound---but the weakness of the script makes it difficult to award it 4 stars. If I were to recommend it it would only be because serious sci fi films are few in number.",1439596800,3,2003,4.791907514450867

8535407,5,B0093SSC00,"I always hesitate to give a movie 5 stars. There are no perfect films. But, for what it is, this is a great science fiction endeavor.

Here's the scoop. Alex Garel (Daniel Bruhl) is a top shelf robot/A.I. engineer. He's returned to his university to work on a project for a ""free"" child. He needs to imprint it with a personality, but too many of the children considered as models he finds boring. Then he runs across a free spirited, if somewhat precocious, young girl who he feels would be ideal. It turns out she's his niece and this opens up a Pandora's Box rolling down a treacherous road.

I liked this movie a lot. It's set in Spain during the winter. Loving attention is paid to the landscapes. Beautifully treed paths, Great overhead shots of forests and mountains. Some scenes were shot where a cold mist obscures the distance giving it an almost otherworldly feel. The production and special effects design are also of note. The were as good as anything I've seen and had a very casual feel. The people populated this newly mechanized world with great comfort. And the science speak sounded authentic. It was all very conversational. The writers didn't feel the need to underline all the techy stuff. It just rolled of the characters' tongues.

I also liked the story. The major plot points were meted out in a very even fashion with enough time between them to get the tension/relaxation thing the right feel. And the thought process regarding the philosophy and mechanics of instilling emotions into androids just sounded so true.

It's difficult to say how good this movie really is. For my dollar it's a must see for any sci-fi buff.",1428624000,2,1648,4.692041522491349
