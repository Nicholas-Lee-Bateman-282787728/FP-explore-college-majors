Synopsis: Budding photographer Karin Swann (Kim Delaney) has returned from India a changed person. While she declines to give many details of her journey she speaks openly of her recent spiritual awakening, Goddess energy and has adopted a Hindu posture and attitude toward life. Not long after her homecoming she receives a large crate from abroad containing a large bronze statue. She immediately places the object in a prominent location in her apartment and subsequently embellishes the image with burning candles, incense and all the other required trappings of any good shrine.

It doesn't take long for further changes in Karin's personality to become manifest to her boyfriend Matt (Chris Sarandon), close friends and business associates. In the days to follow it becomes increasingly obvious that something is taking over Karin's body and mind. Matt must discover what took place in India if he hopes to help her regain control of her life.

I've been waiting for quite a long time to see this film. Produced in '94 `Temptress' has yet to be released on a -Region 1- DVD (there is a -Region 2- version available for those who have the appropriate player). I finally gave up waiting and purchased the VHS tape which I watched last night. I must say I was pleasantly surprised, this is an enjoyable, alluring and somewhat provocative film boasting an attractive fairly well-known cast, solid production values and plot. It also possesses (possesses, get it?) a mystical, surreal and erotic feel to the production that will demand your attention throughout.

This production reminds me of another earlier film released in '88 by Merchant Ivory that also deals with the subject of the Hindu Destroyer Goddess Kali and spirit possession. The film is `The Deceivers' starring Pierce Brosnan and is one of my favorite films. I guess I must have a weakness for the Goddess or anything Hindi for that matter.

All and all `Temptress' delivers an enjoyable viewing experience. The film does contain some intermittent mild nudity and eroticism, but it isn't gratuitous in any way and is totally in keeping with the films storyline and the belief system surrounding the Goddess Kali. I'll admit some of the dialogue is somewhat corny, especially those lines delivered by Dr. Sanudaya (Ben Cross) and the ending is predictable, but in my estimation it doesn't inflict too much damage on the exotic flavor and mood of the movie that works so well.

This is definitely a diamond in the rough waiting to be discovered. Get this film and a copy of `The Deceivers' and have a Kali double-feature. Even better, add a copy of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' to your playlist and make it an all-nighter! ""KALI MA""",1302652800,,2797,4.965811965811966

There is mild nudity and eroticism in the movie so i guess the R rating is deserved. The dialog is predictable at times, but pay close attention. . .

7852152,4,630366704X,"An odd little film that I wanted to be offended by because I thought it would denote the Goddess Kali in a negative way but surprisingly it didn't, it showed her in her pure feminine force, taking over the mind and body of a beautiful young woman, played by the often unappreciated actress Kim Delaney.

Chris Sarandon plays Kim's bewildered boyfriend Matt who is at first appreciative of her new found bedroom skills but he soon realises that something has happened to his girlfriend since she returned from her trip to India and it has something to do with a beautiful brass statue of the ancient Goddess Kali.

He seeks help from an Indian Doctor, played by another under appreciated actor Ben Cross who warns him that the power of Kali is in the Karin (Kim) and that she will devour Karin's very being unless he (Matt) fights the Goddess for control of Karin's soul.

However Kali isn't willing to give Karin up so easily, and what follows is a fight between raw ancient energy and a young man's love for his girlfriend which ends not with the destruction of Kali but a compromise between the ancient and the new.

All in all a surprisingly intelligent little film with a delicious performance from an unknown actress called Katrina McNeal who plays a sensual Indian woman who flits in and out of Karin's dreams drawing her into Kali's sensual embrace.

It's a pretty good for a budget film and I would say worth adding to your video collection if you want something a little different to warm those cold lonely nights in front of the TV when there is nothing else on that takes your fancy.",1143244800,6,1594,4.578947368421052
7852153,3,630366704X,"One might think that 'The Temptress' would be a mediocre film, but it is quiet good. The way the film has been shot, it seems like B-grade fare, but don't let that put you off. Kim Delaney does a fantastic job of playing Karen, and Chris Sarandon as Matthew is excellent. It may not be their best acting roles or movies in their career but 'The Temptress is a compelling and interesting film to watch, with a very nice love scene between Chris and Kim, which is a pleasure to watch. Anyone that is curious about this film, give it a chance.",1046995200,4,540,4.303921568627451
7852154,5,630366704X,"Kim Delaney, always a pleasure to watch, returns from a trip to India during which, without her conscious knowledge, she'd been ""inoculated"" with the strength of a Hindu female goddess. Among what follows is some pleasant-to-watch erotica. And, of course, a struggle.
It's not of Academy Award caliber; there were two scenes I would expect to see in a ""B"" movie. The rest, in my opinion, more than makes up for these two scenes.
Given what happened in New York on September 11th and America's response, this movie has a message about violence and non-violence. Don't look for it to be a simplistic message.",1004227200,7,606,4.836538461538462
