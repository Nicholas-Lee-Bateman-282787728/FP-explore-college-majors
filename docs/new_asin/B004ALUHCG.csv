8420458,4,B004ALUHCG,"What for many parents might be a bewildering landscape is for their children the norm: the digital revolution has had a profound impact on almost every part of our life in the West, and it is this brave new world in which today's children are growing up. But how can our children be equipped to face these challenges and embrace these opportunities? To help us, David Murray provides a short but helpful treatment (see preview and trailer below), in which he gives four Biblical principles to help us understand the technology around us. Following on, he offers three possible responses: enthusiastic embrace, strict separation, or disciplined discernment. Eschewing the thoughtlessness of the first two, he embraces the third, offering seven helpful steps drawn from Scripture by means of which to negotiate this realm, and to equip our children, under God, to deal with it righteously. So prevalent are these pressures that it is often a case of master or be mastered. In such a context, Murray's suggestions will direct parents to manage their own digital load, as well as help their children learn how to live to God's glory in the dawn of the digital age. The concrete recommendations of useful software and websites are helpful. Individual families will profit from this, but the material would be just as useful in church and other settings where the battle lines need to be drawn and the appropriate spiritual equipment issued.",1300320000,,1435,5.00836820083682

While recognizing the power of the Internet for facilitating a responsible civil society, enhanced civil engagement and broad democratic participation, scholars are also quick to note the potential of these powerful new technologies to promote evil in equal proportion to the good they can do. Opportunities for ethical retrogression by the dishonest pose a danger for the innocent who may be victimized in innumerable ways.

Calling our young people ""digital natives"" because of their digital fluency does not lessen the need to recognize that, in may ways, they are like, ""babies with superpowers,"" who don't necessarily understand the longer term consequences of their actions as they assume new roles in cyber space.

This video is a tool for parents, teachers and guardians to use in forming their own balanced approach to the use of digital technologies and the training of their children to become digital citizens of candor and wise judgment. I highly recommend it.",1294963200,2,1651,6.6342592592592595
