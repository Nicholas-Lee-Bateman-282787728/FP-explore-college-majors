8701261,2,B0035Z1H86,"As a sucker for obscure 70's hard rock / proto punk I was excited to come across this DVD.  In 1974 when this concert was filmed, video technology was in its infancy.  The resulting footage reflects this as the concert was shot in Black + White with images hard to make out at some points (sort of reminds me of the sketchier quality footage from the New York Dolls ""All Dolled Up"" DVD from a few years back).  In the Dolls case however, songs & charismatic performances made up for the video's technical issues.

While the Imperial Dogs appear to be somewhat into their set (well, the singer Don Waller anyway) their material / performance is nowhere near the same league which makes for a less than thrilling viewing experience.  This was only ID's second live performance after all.  Funny enough the liner notes mention that ID's band members were totally letdown when they first watched this video - I must say I agree with their initial impressions.

The booklet on the other hand is well done and written with insight, containing interesting flyers, clippings, etc...  Although well done, I find the packaging misleading since all photos (front & back cover, in color no less) are shot close up with good sight lines which is what I expected the actual footage to look like.  I was disappointed to find the camera was set at a distance from the stage with occasional zoom ins and that the heads of audience members obscure most of the singers ""outrageous"" stage antics!

If you decide to buy this DVD be aware of the limitations & hopefully you'll end up enjoying it more than I have so far...",1311206400,,1600,4.6219081272084805
