8299301,5,B001EQ128S,"Let's start off withe the ""Corvair in Action"" segment.  It is humorous to watch the Corvair promotion. The engineer-test drivers treat the car as if it is an SUV, driving it through rough terrain and even in a stream.  It is equally ironic that they run the car through a slalom course, touting it's ""precise"" handling.  Of course, reality is that the Corvair was one of the most dangerous cars ever made for the average motorist; General Motors should have realized that only professional drivers could handle the cars dangerous over-steer.
That said, the ""Tomorrow's Driver's "" segment quite correctly implies that the first priority in driving safety should be that drivers are properly trained.  Still, one gets the impression that the manufacturers could shrug off the fact that many of their designs were inherently dangerous, by stating that most accidents were the fault of ""the nut behind the wheel"".
As for the other segments, such as ""Wonderful New World Ford"" seem so innocent.  Remember, this was the era before obnoxious pop culture became prevalent, so the music in this advertisements seem to harken back to a simpler time.
All in all, this DVD is a good trip down memory lane, even for those who were born decades later !!",1223856000,,1239,4.880952380952381
