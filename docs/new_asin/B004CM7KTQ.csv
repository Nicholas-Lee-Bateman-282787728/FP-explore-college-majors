8423256,5,B004CM7KTQ,"This documentary is wonderful because you get to hear the story of the modern hospice movement from the people who really were ""pioneers."" Dame Cicely Saunders and Elisabeth Kbler-Ross are no longer alive so this provides a rare opportunity to hear them speak.",1414713600,,260,5.069767441860465

8423259,5,B004CM7KTQ,We used this video to present the history of the hospice movement to our volunteers in training. It provides a great chronolgy of the evolution of hospice in the world. I have seen it twice in the last four months and find that I will look forward to seeing again for the message it delivers. A great foundation.,1349740800,,312,4.396551724137931
8423260,5,B004CM7KTQ,"This should be REQUIRED viewing for all persons planning a career in healthcare.  Every single human being, regardless of education, socioeconomic status, reputation, or political affiliation will experience 2 events in Life that are shared by every other human being:  We are all born & we will all die.  The question is:  How do we want either of these experiences to occur?  This DVD introduces us to the individuals who have served as ""pioneers"" in helping all of us take a look at what we want when the end of our life approaches.  These are the people who have helped shape the bedside conversations today that would never have occured without their input & contribution. Slowly but surely, these practitioners continue to ""Change the face of dying"".",1343606400,,756,4.913385826771654
8423261,5,B004CM7KTQ,"This is a beautifully done exploration of the history of the hospice movement. I have recommended it to patients, and friends and family, to dispel misconceptions and fears about end of life. The interviews depicted and the stories told shed light on the potential for experiencing a good death, and inspire an intention to achieve one. This issue is as relevant today as it ever has been (perhaps more so), and this DVD begins to contextualize having frank and respectful conversations about this tender (and universal) aspect of life.",1335744000,,536,5.033707865168539
8423262,5,B004CM7KTQ,"""Pioneers of Hospice"" is a beautifully contructed, emotionally and artistically exquisite, and intellectually compelling film chronicaling the development of the hospice movement.  It's strength comes not only from the story of the historical process, but more importantly from the amazingly honest and warm interviews with the founders and champions of the hospice movement.

I have used this film with healthcare risk managers, many of whom are nurses and/or lawyers.  The wonderful unintended consequence was discussion about end of life care today, about the perseverance and fortitude required to move a system, and about how we can humanize the dying process even more.

This film is a must for any healthcare facility, hospice, or medical library. It should also be part of any curriculum or group that conducts a discussion on death and dying in America.",1313107200,,862,5.362962962962963
8423263,5,B004CM7KTQ,"The documentary ""Pioneers of Hospice: Changing the Face of Dying"" gives the viewer an insider's understanding of a topic often considered taboo in Western society: death. Hospice workers model a respect and reverence for life, rather than fear of death, while showing the importance of embracing end-of-life care as a natural part of the living process. ""Pioneers of Hospice"" sheds light on the cost of this ""denial of death"" on our full understanding of the human lifespan: from birth, through the days of our lives, to the natural conclusion of death. In thought-provoking terms, this documentary defines the current debate, spoken through the words of Hospice founders and end-of-life scholars themselves: Dame Cicely Saunders, Florence Wald, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and Balfour Mount. While death and dying are common experiences to all living things, the topic is often shunned in the course of everyday conversation and is inadequately addressed in the psychotherapeutic community. This film is must viewing for students in the fields of: clinical psychology, social work, family counseling, palliative care and divinity studies. In no other format is such a depth of dialogue available on the topic of end-of-life care, spiritual considerations of life transition, and ways to encourage the greater community to embrace new approaches to ""being-with"" loved ones at the end of the lifespan. This documentary is a guide for anyone interested in existential questions of life and death, and ways to engage the topic with an open heart. You will never look at death the same way again.",1295654400,,1586,5.322709163346613
8423264,5,B004CM7KTQ,"What could be amore basic human issues than how we might die with less fear and pain, and how we might help one another more compassionately and skillfully? If you want to explore such questions,this is the film for you.

This documentary by Terrance Youk, and produced by the Madison-Deane Initiative, profiles pioneering figures in the birth of the hospice movement in the modern society and its growth from a single hospice in England to a worldwide movement. Thanks to the pioneering efforts of people like Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Cicely Saunders, Florence Wald, and Balfour Mount, many people all over the world have now benefitted from a more holistic, compassionate, and knowledgeable approach to end-of-life care. These individuals spurred not only the growth of the hospice movement, but the growing field of palliative care, a medical specialty focusing on the care of persons with chronic, life threatening, or terminal illness.

As the United States embarks on a debate and rethinking of our health care system, the insights and experiences of these pivotal figures shed light on how much we have progressed and how much we still desperately need to improve. The dialogue on improving the care of the dying is as relevant now as it was in the days of these visionaries, especially as our population ages and we are faced with more chronic diseases.

I have often used this film as a component of workshops I teach on a contemplative approach to facing death and helping the dying. It really opens up the dialogue on a subject that is not always easy to discuss. I find that it helps viewers look into their own issues and those of the broader society in facing the reality of death and finding a way to come to terms with our own mortality. At the same time, it challenges us to think more deeply about how to help people with terminal illness find support, meaning, and value in this stage of their life.

The personalities highlighted in this film are vivid examples of how addressing this very human reality--that we all face death--leads not to depression but to living fully and with delight, humor, and compassion. And for people interested in the broader topic of social movements and social change, this film  demonstrates the amazing social transformations the passionate work of a few individuals can spark.",1292371200,3,2328,4.928571428571429
