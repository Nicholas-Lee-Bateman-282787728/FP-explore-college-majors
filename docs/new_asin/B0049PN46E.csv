4292222,5,B0049PN46E,"Not to many episodes with Larry Keating (Roger Addison) because of death, but episodes are very funny. However, the first three seasons with Roger and Kay are the best ever. There was only one competitor selling this dvd and it was a bit high at $40. It arrived very quickly and in mint condition.",1304553600,6,297,4.518518518518518
4292223,5,B0049PN46E,"I am very pleased with this purchase.  No commercials, not taped off a tv station, and relatively clear on my big screen tv.  These dvd's bring back great memories and are far better than sitcoms today!",1301184000,9,202,4.583333333333333
4292224,5,B0049PN46E,"5 stars all the way for this show.  Fantastic, fabulous.  A genuine classic comedy bound to have you in fits of laughter from start to finish.  They don't make comedies like this nowadays......more's the pity.  Fun for all the family.  My grandchildren love it as much as I do.  Please, please, please bring out series 5 & 6, preferably together, as I've heard there's only 13 episodes in series 6.  If you want good old fashioned comedy, that's a laugh a minute, buy this dvd.  Guaranteed to make you feel ""young at heart"" again.......and who doesn't want to feel like that.  Excellent buying.",1296691200,9,594,4.689320388349515
4292225,5,B0049PN46E,"Here it is folks if you are a fan and want to know what is in it. The set comes in keep case in my opinion it's the best for DVD sets. I don't care for fancy custom cases that usually gets damaged in mail when shipped with dents in the box or inside broken teeth that hold the disc. The Custom cases can't be replaced when keep case are easy to find if damaged or have that ugly wrinkled looking plastic.

Their are 4 DVD in the set with a nice wooden fence,barn on it. The set runs for 11 hours. Special Feature a promo for U.S Bonds for Mister Ed. The episodes i haven't checked all but i checked a few on it and it runs over to 25 minutes. I presume these would be uncut if they all similar.

Do yourself a favor if a fan or into great funny sitcoms of the past and buy the season set so Season 5 and 6 have no problem in getting released. I like too see the last 2 Seasons combined as Season 6 runs as 13 episodes if possible.",1295827200,11,930,3.863874345549738

4292240,5,B0049PN46E,Life doesn't get any better than watching Mister Ed bat against Sandy Koufax and seeing the Dodgers' players!  I recommend this DVD to all Mister Ed fans.  It brings back wonderful memories.,1391644800,,190,4.90625
4292241,5,B0049PN46E,"Best season of Mister Ed. The POSTS get new neighbors and Ed seems to come out of his shell more. The 1st episode Ed hits a home run, and runs all the bases in Dodger stadium, my fav.",1390867200,,183,3.8421052631578947

4292243,5,B0049PN46E,"There are not to many series that could lure The Classic herself Mae West out of retirement but Mr. Ed did it. At the time Mae West was interviewed and asked why she did this series Mr. Ed and her reply was that she herself watched it and it made all the problems of the day go away. That statement from Mae West pretty well says it all,this was a series that did not go on binges about political things nor did it show and say such dirty things that you did not want any kids to watch it. This show is clean,funny,entertaining and just a joy to watch. The price is a little steep and hopefully that will come down in the future,but you will not find a better more entertaining show thatn this one. Maybe the producers of the crap thats on tv today should take note why all these old shows are so popular,when you can remember all the characters names and roles but today I could not tell you any one in any series...Mr. Ed is a series you can watch all night,if you have the money buy them all.",1388361600,2,995,4.134020618556701
4292244,3,B0049PN46E,"This review is just my impressions about the release after checking out the first disc in the set.  OK?  This is a terrible formatted presentation of the episodes overall!  There is no time data in the episodes so you can't set a bookmark and come back to continue viewing where you left off.  This is a big deal for me because I watch single episodes and even watch partial segments on certain occasions.  I go to the next episode and routinely set a bookmark for the next view at a  later time.  That cannot be done when there is no time data on the disc.  Timeless Media has issued many releases in the past that do this and it infuriates me!  The previous MR. ED seasons are fine even if they have user challenging menus. What's more infuriating here is that SHOUT has a preview sequence at the beginning which plays automatically so you have to skip a number of chapters to get to the episode menu! This is not very user friendly in my opinion!  There is a possibility that the other discs will have time data on them and no preview section.  I say this because the RIVERBOAT series release I purchased had only this missing time data on the first disc only, so I'm hopeful that this is just a single disc error and not the format for the entire season!  More on that later!
I hope SHOUT is not going to practice the bad habits of their new partner (TIMELESS MEDIA) for their future releses!",1385424000,,1396,4.347490347490347
4292245,5,B0049PN46E,"I now have Season 4 & 5 of Mister Ed and will be purchasing the first 3 seasons shortly - but where is Season 6??

4292257,5,B0049PN46E,"To fill the gap many of us have turned to old favorite TV shows on DVD from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. Mr. Ed is one of those shows. So many shows today can't complete a sentence without a filthy word or two. These old shows are classic fun to watch at any age and with any family member in the room...",1365379200,,301,3.870967741935484

4292262,5,B0049PN46E,"Unfortunately, the tragic loss of Addison during the fourth season was a huge blow to the show, the production kept the show as faithful as possible for the last two years. These are great shows too! The Colonel was no Addison, but the caliber of the show remained high! Thanks for the great service...I love Mr. Ed!",1356912000,,316,4.56140350877193
4292263,3,B0049PN46E,"is ok, but not as good as the first 3 seasons. Show is getting too silly at times and it shows that they had new writers for the show.",1349827200,,134,3.6551724137931036
4292264,5,B0049PN46E,"Mister Ed is a horse. He is possibly the most famous horse in the world, due to his show's six-season run that has been constantly replayed in syndication for over half a century. But what do we really know about Mister Ed?

He is impetuous. He's single-minded in purpose. He's a tad lazy, loving to both sleep and eat. He doesn't like heavy riders. He's a Palomino who claims to be eight years old. He's a hypochondriac. He reads the newspaper, comic books and a select number of magazines. He loves watching the late movie show on his portable 60's era television. He has a real eye for the fillies. He loves carrots. He remains actively engaged with the ASPCA. And, oh yes, he can talk.

But, he only talks to Wilbur. Actually, that's not quite true, even though Mister Ed constantly repeats that claim to Wilbur (""You know I only talk to YOU!""). Mister Ed shows little to no hesitation in using the telephone to phone-order some dalliance, contact the ASPCA with a complaint, or eavesdrop on the telephone party line to catch the local gossip. (Mister Ed loves to eavesdrop on gossip, so we should add that to the above list.) All this means that, indeed, Mister Ed actually DOES talk to quite a number of people, but only when he can do so without revealing his equine identity (the exception is that he will, on occasion, talk to kids, because, in Ed's own words, ""Who'll believe a kid, anyway?""). But with Wilbur Post, Mister Ed's owner, he's as garrulous a horse as you'll ever find.

And speaking of talking, did you perhaps notice the very thing that is so obvious that you might never think about it: Mister Ed's very first word to us, in every single episode, is ""Hello!"" ""Hello! I'm Mister Ed."" The first word of each show, then, breaks Ed's own rule, because he speaks to each of us while we look at him, standing in his stable. (Cool piece of subterfuge, huh?)

Like many people in the United States, I grew up watching Mister Ed. (His name is always presented as ""Mister Ed,"" without abbreviated spelling, never as ""Mr. Ed."") As a child, the show enchanted me and made me feel like I was part of a special, magical universe. When my wife and I recently started watching the episodes on DVD, I hadn't seen the show for decades, and I wondered if I could enjoy it as much as my memories would lead me to believe. But it was easy to see right from the start that the magic was still there. I admit to being caught off guard by this: the thought of a grown man my age watching a show that ostensibly was aimed at children seemed to be an exercise that would end in boredom and a perhaps create a little dent on my childhood reminiscences.

But the magic is still there. There is absolutely something special about this most special of shows. It's engaging. It's funny. It's even sometimes thought provoking. And much like the original Andy Griffith Show, there's even an occasional lesson about life woven into the story.

The horse Mister Ed is simply gorgeous, even by horse standards. His face is the envy of horses everywhere, and the director and filing crew found a way to bring out Ed's beauty in most every scene. As a Palomino, Mister Ed is a golden chestnut brown, but for reasons that I can't fully explicate, he is best portrayed on the ""silver"" screen. It's also apparent from watching these shows afresh as an adult, that Wilbur (Alan Young) was genuinely fond of Mister Ed, and Mister Ed fond of him. That very real affection clearly shows in many episodes: it's not something that can be ""acted"" over such a long period of time. Mister Ed (real name, Bamboo Harvester), too, was an exceptionally intelligent animal who was able to do tricks and tasks that likely would have been much more difficult, or sometimes, impossible, for other horses to learn, and these skills are put to great use in the show, often with few filming cuts, or other camera trickery.

So, what is it about this show that makes it so special, and that has kept it in constant play around the world for now over half a century? We'll, it's in part the magic of the concept. Mister Ed as the prankster who is always getting Wilbur into trouble because he has called on the phone to order new furniture for his stable, or to call the ASPCA because he's not getting enough carrots. Or by sabotaging Wilbur's guests at the house because Mister Ed is missing out on the daily attention he insists upon. Or stealing Addison's delicious homegrown apples from the backyard using a variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques but nearly always found out.

Perhaps also it is watching Mister Ed carry out and execute tasks that make you wonder how it could have been done. He was a truly talented horse, and some of these actions are mesmerizing, even for horse aficionados that know all about horses from first-hand contact.

And, undeniably, Mister Ed's gorgeous face is enough to steal every single scene--and I mean every single one in which he appears--regardless of who else is present. Maybe this, too, is one of the reasons for the enduring nature of the show. Mister Ed is so gorgeous that it is hard to understand why he ultimately has so much trouble with the fillies. But it is hilarious to watch Ed with his passing love interests, sometimes resulting in Ed demanding height-increasing horseshoes (because the filly he likes is taller than he), and other times prompting him to change his diet to shed a few pounds so he'll be able to complete with the other suitors aiming for the same filly.

As a kid, the show entranced me with it's magic of a talking horse, and as an adult, I still find that impact, but I now as an adult note that one of the things that makes the show laugh-out-loud funny at points is the biting sarcasm and the great one-liners that Mister Ed constantly uses. The writing for Mister Ed's dialogue is simply excellent. How can an adult sit there and laugh at this? But you will. Mister Ed comes up with some truly hilarious lines, often delivered with defiance and irony. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the show works so well: the deep and droll delivery of Mister Ed's lines (voiced by the un-credited Allan ""Rocky"" Lane) works so well and is so engaging that its difficult not to be hanging on every word.

As far as the technical quality of these DVD's, they are clear as anything, with only an occasional episode with less video quality (perhaps the master for those few episodes were lost). If you are watching these with an up-sampling DVD player and a flat screen TV, you're likely to be as amazed as I with the film clarity of the show. The sound track is general good, as well, with only an occasional imperfection on a couple of episodes. But for the vast majority of episodes, the video and audio are excellent. Mister Ed never looked so good.

Mister Ed is simply a delightful show. Don't worry about how they got his lips to move at just the right moments in extended conversations with nearly no camera cuts, or how Ed can call the house from the barn if the two phones are on the same line, or how Ed can type on the typewriter with a nose that would have simultaneously hit seven keys with each tap. Just accept it. It's magical. And it's not just for the kids. They will love it, but so will you.",1342742400,4,7255,4.521341463414634
