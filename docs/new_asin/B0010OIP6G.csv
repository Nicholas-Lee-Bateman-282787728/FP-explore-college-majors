8238105,4,B0010OIP6G,"Mayflower Madam, 1987 film

This is based on a true crime that occurred in New York city in the 1980s. A woman steps into a taxicab and is dropped off at an apartment house. The police are taking people away! The apartment is messed up from a police search! Six years earlier there was the Annual Ball of Mayflower descendants. Sydney Biddle Barrows works for a living, she cant go on vacation. Young woman make their debut into society (they are ready for marriage). Sydney has a conflict at work and is fired. Would kickbacks affect purchasing? A friend works for an escort service taking phone calls and mentions a job there. Can Sydney go into business for herself? She explains why she was fired. Can she depend on her relatives? She meets Eddie Quinn, who sends out women per orders. Later she meets her boyfriend at his place. Sheila adds class to the operation. What the customer wants the customer gets.

One woman had a problem with her customer! Girls didn't get paid because checks bounced, he says. Sheila quits. Can they start their own service where the girls have a say? [No union representation?] Cachet provides companionship services. She offers a 60-40 split instead of the regular 50-50 split. One day she rides to NJ to view the mansions of the very rich. Sydney uses a Rolodex to keep track of clients. An old friend drops by. Sheila advertises in a New York magazine. [The pre-Internet days. Note the 8086 computer with 5.25"" floppies.] Can she get into trouble? One day Sheila finds spray-painted graffiti on the sidewalk. What about all the young women who visit her apartment? Sheila calls Eddie to warn him. Matt questions Sydney about her apartment (hes not allowed to visit). Later she looks at a new place for herself. Police detectives visit Sheilas apartment house. [Note all the locks on the doors.]

There was a complaint about the young women who visit Sheilas apartment. [Not a business office.] The police watch her place. Sheila tells Matt she is running a Temporary Help Agency. Her clients must behave or are dropped. At the opera Sydney meets a client; does he recognize her voice? The police stakeout continues. There is a subpoena on her door! They want to evict her and do. Matt wants Sydney to stop her business, she refuses. Sydney is proud of her business. Some of her girls are new. The law is explained to them so they can stay legal. Matt has a new girlfriend. One client questions her. She does the same, but doesnt see his airplane ticket! This is proof of a visitor.

Next the police raid her apartment! [The revolvers date this action.] The girls are arrested and taken away. There is a front page headline! Sydney will turn herself in. Book her. She can get up to seven years in prison. Sydney talks about hypocrisy. The DA had to act on peoples complaints. Sydneys lawyer wants to call her clients into court; that could ruin careers. There were 340 lawyers who were clients! The charges will be lowered to a misdemeanor plus a nominal fine. [You wonder how many important politicians were among them.] Sydney won't attend the Mayflower descendants ball again; she is recognized wherever she goes. Does she realize she did wrong? Why not?

You wonder what was omitted from this story. There was another call girl scandal around 1951 where a member of society was implicated. Does news like this serve as a distraction from more important and relevant events? Were there any payoffs needed to stay in business?",1458950400,,3466,4.722314049586777
