8045022,5,B00076ON1E,"This movie is such a gem, and hard to find.  I'm glad i was able to find this at such a good price!",1482796800,,99,3.3043478260869565
8045023,2,B00076ON1E,"Jennifer (Caroline Capers Powers) discovers a necromancy writing box and decides to have fun with the expected consequences. Meanwhile there is a butch looking killer (Pam La Testa) running around in the city. Formula story, bad acting and dialogue.

The film attempts to create creepy with red fonts and a Rider Back Tarot deck. It has a shop, ""The Magickal Child."" That's magick with a ""K"" so it means something more. I also find it odd that a prostitute would be trying to pick up guys in front of a ""male revue"" establishment.

The film was made in an era where ""veal"" wasn't a four letter word.

No f-bombs or nudity. Sex scene.",1417305600,3,633,4.584070796460177
8045024,3,B00076ON1E,"If you like crappy movies, and have enough beers in you, you can do a lot worse than spending an evening watching this. The interview with Findlay is somewhat entertaining and the DVD is pretty inexpensive. I was not as bored watching this as some people said they were. I found the leading lady to be easy on the eyes, and the weird lesbian killer thing kept me interested. The special effects are cheap, but that's half the fun. I did not find the movie to be incompetently made, just low budget. Worth a peek if your a Roberta Findlay completist or like these sort of movies like I do, but then again I enjoyed Snuff.",1402272000,,620,4.353448275862069
8045025,1,B00076ON1E,"Don't get me wrong, I love low-budget 80's horror flicks(and I have quite the collection)...however, this is garbage. The acting is laughable, special effects and make-up are like a late 60's art student's experimental film, and there isn't much to be said of music either. I haven't tossed or sold my copy yet because I feel that popping the DVD in to laugh at the ""skull flying through hospital window scene"" and ""muppet-like corpse in the car"" are just too funny. Believe it or not, many great low-budget 80's films could still deliver a good scare and not be embarrassingly funny. For example: ""The Deadly Spawn(directed by Ted Bohas),"" was filmed in remote New Jersey on a budget under $20,000 and yet the creatures were terrifying and original. Kiddies, go out and buy the DVD of ""Deadly Spawn"" instead...you'll have a much better time. Did I mention that this movie lulls on and on and is boring as hell...I'll leave that as a final note on the dreaded ""Oracle.""",1398816000,,969,4.739644970414201
8045026,1,B00076ON1E,"One of director Roberta Findlay's worst films of all time, but if you need to own every film she has made, this is the perfect DVD for you.",1385683200,,139,4.0
8045027,3,B00076ON1E,"First off, you can't go into comparing these horror flicks to big budget ones haha.  That being said, if you can handle bad acting and appreciate the story itself, than you can enjoy this little horror flick.  Besides, that old gypsy is kinda creepy.  Again, not the strongest ghost flick you've seen already, but this one has its moments!  Will Jennifer overcome her obsession with the gypsy's oracle!?....you'll just have to find out!",1259798400,,436,4.931506849315069
8045028,1,B00076ON1E,"This flick has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen! It's so stupid and the lead actress's screams give me agita!!!bad bad bad bad film!!!!!!!!!!!!This director also did the notorious exploitation SNUFF, I don't know what happend when the director did this piece of @#*%! I wish i could give it a bomb rating but the lowest i can possibly give it is 1 star-too bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1239494400,,396,4.753623188405797
