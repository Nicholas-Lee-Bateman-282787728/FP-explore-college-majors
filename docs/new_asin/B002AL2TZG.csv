This workout is done at a faster pace than most pilates workouts but using my heart rate monitor my heart rate never reached even the low cardio rate.

In my opinion this workout moves too quickly to allow you to
focus on good form and not quickly enough to be a cardio workout.  The best I can say is you get a lot done in 30 minutes.",1294358400,4,508,4.195876288659794
8359766,3,B002AL2TZG,"I wish I had known because I would have saved my money.  The library near me has a copy.  However, that being said, for those of you who don't have the 2006 release, or done the workout, it's a good Pilates routine.  It was actually the first Pilates DVD I ever did, so I know it will be easy to follow for someone who has never done Pilates.  There are a few tough moves, but you can modify to fit your level until.  The instructor Elizabeth Garcia works with two other women.  The woman with the short blond hair does all the beginner modifications.  The only choice you have is to play the sections individually or altogether.  The sections are Intro, Pilates Total Body Toning, and Bonus 12 Minute workout.  Some moves from Total Body Toning are leg scoops and circles, a bridge series that also works your legs; single leg stretches, and modified side planks.

The Bonus Workout has nothing to do with Pilates, and it's a different instructor than Elizabeth Garcia.  You do one minute warm up, ten minutes of compound movements, and 30 second cool down.  Some sample moves are lunges and squats with rows, bicep curls, triceps, and military presses, pushups, chest flies, the obliques, and abs.  Even though it's strength training, instead of Pilates, I feel that the Bonus 12 Minute section is a nice addition to the DVD.  It does a good job of working the entire body in a short amount of time.  You need 2 sets of weights and a mat.

I have no idea why Gaiam called it Cardio Pilates except to change the title so people won't realize the workout has already been released.  Plus, the title is misleading.  It has no cardio beyond what you might normally experience when doing Pilates.  They've done this before with other DVDs.  I don't have a problem with them re-releasing it so people can continue to buy it, except they should give the buyer a heads up.  I debated taking a star off for this, and decided because they (1) changed the title so you don't know you are getting a re-release, (2) changed the title to something that doesn't fit the routine, and (3) better workouts have been released since 2006 (see DVDs from Element Pilates, Ana Caban, and 10 minute solution), I would give the DVD 3 stars.

Overall, these are two solid routines that I foresee using occasionally.",1271116800,18,2291,4.563725490196078
