8365991,5,B0019BIB4Q,"As a huge ""Good Eats"" fan, I'm always impressed with the scope of Alton Brown's ability to teach so much diverse material in a half hour show. I love fish (particularly salmon), though I find it challenging to cook perfectly. This three episode set excels at teaching people basic ways to cook fish to perfection, and I highly recommend it. ""Where There's Smoke There's Fish"" is a wonderful, quirky episode that features an Alton Brown original: ""The Good Eats Custom Corrugated Vapor Colloid Applicator"" (a.k.a. ""Cardboard Box Smoker""). Although this may seem esoteric, there's actually a lot to be learned here and I adore this episode. ""Tuna: The Other Red Meat"" is another standout and you'll definitely want to check out the recipe for ""Chimney Tuna Loin"". This episode also lets us visit the afterlife briefly, which is a tad irregular for a cooking show. ""Hook, Line and Dinner"" is probably the most useful of the three for most home cooks as it showcases numerous common ways to prepare fish that are delicious and relatively easy. I particularly recommend the ""Grilled Salmon Steaks"" preparation.

This is a particularly great set even by the extremely high standards of ""Good Eats"". Pick it up today and then head to your local fishmonger!",1473638400,,1249,4.947619047619048
