There a three songs with video footage from this concert available on YouTube at this time and I think that those selected songs are excellent. I strongly recommend that you watch those videos. And if you are a fan of Baba Olatunji and his Drums of Passion, you will want this concert footage. Also consider the ""African Drumming"" DVD by Olatunji as well as his Drums of Passion albums.
Here are links to three of the videos: The opening song Ajaja; Odun De; and Akiwowo.

8226719,4,B000X245SI,"This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji!  If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan.  Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD.  I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc.  I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect.",1260316800,4,427,4.0476190476190474
