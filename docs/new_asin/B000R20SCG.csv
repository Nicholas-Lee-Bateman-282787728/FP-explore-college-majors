8198311,5,B000R20SCG,"This series became one of my favorites when it was aired for a limited time on U.S. Public TV in the 80s. For years, I longed to see all the episodes again, but I hesitated to order the DVDs because they were all accompanied by the warning that theyd be playable ONLY on Area 2 DVD players (the kind that are standard in England and most of the rest of Europe).

But then I read online that there might be certain codes a person could enter to transform U.S. Area 1 DVD players into Area 2 players. Since the first two series of Sorry were available for a relatively nominal price, I decided to take a chance. However, when I received the discs, I was unable to play them on my regular dedicated DVD player hooked up to my TV  no matter what kind of hackers code-entering maneuvers I attempted.

Then someone suggested I try putting them in the disc drive on my laptop. I hadnt thought of that! And voila! Without my having to punch in any codes at all, Ronnie Corbett sprang into immediate life in cheery combat with his tartar of a mother!

I have Windows 7 on my current computer, but I find I am also able to play the discs on older laptops I still have sitting around, using older operating systems. And I suspect newer operating systems will also play the discs.

At one point though, my computer issued a message that I could only alternate 5 times between playing Area 1 and other Area discs on it. After that, the computer would lock into place on the last kind of Area format being played. So if you feel this and similar Area 2-only-available English series might appeal to you, I suggest you get them en masse  and then do some binge watching. That way, you won't go back-and-forth too much and use up your computers willingness to be flexible.

This Sorry series at least is well worth watching in toto. Ronnie Corbetts character is irresistible. Even though he might seem to be in the un-cool position of a 40-something librarian who lives at home with his parents  I think hes the kind of person every woman at heart wishes she could date. And hes the kind of person every man might admire for his ability to rise above the dominance hes under and to make a delightful time out of life, notwithstanding.

Of course, Timothy Lumsden conspires to create his own condition. He essentially is content to stay at home, and invents reasons why it would be injudicious to leave his parents on their own. He represents the age-old conflict between remaining with the comfortable known  and venturing out into the hazards of the unknown. But whereas most people opt early on for the latter, Timothy is able to make the former home-body option rife with potential for challenge and humorous adventure.

Timothy Lumsden teaches how to be a more enthusiastic, more forgiving person  even when faced with difficult others and thwarting life circumstances. If you have to wear a comic cat suit to a dance, do it with aplomb. If you're having a hard time bringing romance to fruition with your mother hovering about - thats still OK. Something will eventually become possible. For now at least: Keep Mom  And Carry On.",1463788800,,3118,4.546428571428572
8198312,5,B000R20SCG,"Though made in the 1980s, Ronnie Corbett's tour de force comedy ""Sorry"" is as bright and fresh today as it was then. Corbett plays Timothy Lumsden, the 40-something librarian still living at home with mummy and daddy, and held there by magnetic forces from which he can never seem to break free. His mother is played with shrill ruthlessness by Barbara Lott, who uses every means to keep him from leaving the nest. His hen-pecked father has long since given up, and the whole scenario could make for a depressing Freudian drama except for the ebullient wit of Ronnie Corbett, whose antics turn it into high comedy. Like a smart-aleck fly caught in a spiderweb of maternal fussiness, Timothy knows he's trapped, but can't admit that he's largely responsible for his own plight. In the meantime, he resorts to all manner of plots to evade his mother's controlling eye, as, in his words, ""Mother is the necessity for invention.""  A hundred years ago, Corbett would have been a hit in silient movies, as his body language and facial expressions are every bit as funny as his ""sarky"" patter.

This disk has the additional feature of interview commentary with Corbett, including many background details about making the series. It's a shame it isn't available for Region 1. Corbett is one of the funniest comedians of our time.",1396051200,,1321,4.84070796460177
8198313,5,B000R20SCG,"I saw this show in the UK when it was originally aired and have always been confused as to why it never made its way to the States.  Absolutely hilarious.  The entire cast is perfect, Ronnie Corbett as the stifled mama's boy, Timothy, with Barbara Lott as his domineering mother and William Moore (Mr. Molly Sugden) as his dad.  You will not be disappointed.  One of the great British comedies, yet strangely I don't think it has ever been repeated in England.  If you can view in PAL format, you will not be disappointed in this series.",1363824000,2,537,4.494845360824742
