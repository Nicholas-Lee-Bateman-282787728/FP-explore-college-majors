8556841,2,B00ARF6XOA,"Peu de mots  faut-il se demander si ce COMTE ORY soit vraiment valide,  part la brava Bartoli et le tenor Camarena? Doutes, doutes.  Je suis tout  fait daccord avec le commentaire de Mr.  Brissaud.
La modernisation est ilogique dans lhistoire de cet opra et le gags des nuances faciales sont souvent  Monsieur Brissaud,
sil vous plait, donnez-moi vos mots   vulgaire - contrastant avec lextrme distinction de la musique de Rossini    Il ne sagit PAS DU TOUT de hilarit, mais comme disons nous - les gnoises dItalie - ici cest un peu comme avoir  quoi faire dans le theatre de Padella.  Cest aussi triste de voir comme Camarena semble samuser  suive les directions du metteur en scne.
Aujourdhui - HLAS - le thtre de lopra - est trop, trop pris entre les mains de metteurs en scne qui font les matres sans en avoir la competence. Est-ce que a nest quune arrogance?  Paye  fior di quattrini  par les directeurs des theatres sans aucune raison.
Ayez donc confiance dans la version du Met et oubliez cette chose suisse.",1519171200,,1015,4.676136363636363
8556842,5,B00ARF6XOA,"Camarena is the star here; not just a voice, but has a good sense of comedy. Bartoli surprised me, not with her vocalism, which was fantastic as usual, but for her 'ballsy' acting (she practically strips in her big aria!). All in all, an excellent production of an opera I am just beginning to appreciate.",1465516800,,305,4.5636363636363635
8556843,5,B00ARF6XOA,"CUTE.  Dumb plot but cleverly done.  And Cecilia Bartoli was the right age to have the right look of knowledge in her eyes.
You need to understand that this type of thing really was for shock value for the audiences of the time in which it was performed.  There might have been hanky-panky but not like the absurdity of this plot.  That was what made it entertaining....it would not have happened.  At least that is the explanation I read.  And this up-dated version - remember that trouser roles were played because of where the original range of the vocal part was composed and so a woman played it, and was assumed to be a man.  Sort of like in Kabuki (Japanese) theatre when someone viewed by the audience was killed - he just got up and walked off the performing area or perhaps two people came in carrying a pole with cloth hanging down, stood in front of the ""dead"" person and then proceeded out with the ""dead"" person hunched over so as to not be seen.  The audience simply accepted it.  So, back then, when they had a goodly supply of counter-tenors or castrati...the latter required to be able to sing more an alto range, not just high tenor.....they did not need women.  In fact, it would not likely have been permitted.  But I mention this because I had to do a lot of researching to understand why they had a young woman in the role of one of the main characters.

Once you realize that it helps to be old enough to view this with understanding, it is downright clever and wonderful.  Cecilia Bartoli plays it to the hilt.  And so do all of the others.  I love this.

8556844,5,B00ARF6XOA,"This is a great version of this very entertaining opera. First of all the five star Cecilia Bartoli, who, I think has at least twice as many vocal cords as any other human in this planet. You cannot explain otherwise how she sings the way she does. Probably the finest living coloratura mezzo-soprano. Javier Camarena plays an extremely funny Comte Ory, and sings superbly his role. I strongly recommend it.",1417132800,2,407,4.828571428571428
8556845,4,B00ARF6XOA,"The singing is quite good.  I am not fond of updating operas, which this version is.  Camarena has a good, natural sound that has stood him well (encore at the MET in Cenerentola).  However, I still prefer Flrez in similar roles because of his acting and, truth be told, his looks.  I find Flrez' voice more flexible and more at ease in florid passages.  This is not to detract from Camarena.  I enjoyed this video and look for more DVDs featuring him.",1417132800,2,452,4.451219512195122
8556846,3,B00ARF6XOA,I BOUGHT THIS TO HEAR CECILIA BARTOLI SING THE ROLE OF ADELE.  SHE IS MARVELOUS.  BUT THE PRODUCTION VALUES LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED.  A MODERN DRESS PRODUCTION (BUT SET IS NICE).  THE MEN HAVE GONE OFF TO THE CRUSADES - HOW ODD IN THIS PRODUCTION.  GET THE MET PRODUCTION WITH FLOREZ.  IT IS OUTSTANDING AND TRADITIONAL.  SETS AND COSTUMES ARE GREAT.  BUY THIS ONLY TO HEAR BARTOLI!!,1403136000,3,384,4.544117647058823
8556847,5,B00ARF6XOA,"This is a wonderful production of Rossini's last comic opera. It rivals the Met production--not in star power (in spite of Cecelia Bartoli's superb performance)--but in its ability to deliver successfully this long-neglected jewel. The Met production delivers because Juan Diego Florez, Diana Damrau, and Joyce DiDonato are impossible to beat--from every point of view.

Still, this Zurich Opera version is a five star production. It's beautifully sung and acted. The updating from medieval times to WWII France works well. And it's really funny!

Rossini took a bedroom farce and made it something sublime. His music alternates between the powerfully erotic and the genuinely comic. The Met production evokes the erotic elements especially well. This Zurich version focuses on the comedy. But it works. And it makes this production of Le Comte Ory an experience of pure joy!",1401926400,7,875,5.333333333333333
8556848,4,B00ARF6XOA,"Having been a fan of Le Comte dOry for a while, I was delighted to get the latest version available on media. This one from Zurich and on Blu-Ray. And does not disappoint. Bartoli once again in her career takes on a difficult soprano role very successfully. Camarena is new to me, and was pleased with both his acting and singing. Niketeanu did a great job as Ragonde and Olvera, again new to me, did a beautiful singing and acting job a Isolier. The weakest part was sung by Widmer as Rambaud, but then I was never a Widmer fan. All in all a very satisfying experience.
Now, which one do I recommend? The first video recording from Glyndebourne from 1997 is, in my humble opinion the best of the three available. The three principals are superb, especially Laho and Montague, and the production is probably more like what the people saw at the premier. The Met version is also good, but lacks in acting.",1399766400,3,904,4.484848484848484
8556849,4,B00ARF6XOA,"Not being a great Bartoli fan, this was much better than I had expected. The updated setting worked really well and Camarana is an excellent Comte - maybe not quite up there with Juan Diego Florez but not far off.  I was a little disappointed with Rebecca Olvera  as Isolier but all in all this is a very enjoyable version.  While it is more imaginative in production, the Met's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-Le-Comte-Ory/dp/B006ZRAF0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini: Le Comte Ory</a>&nbsp;with Florez, Damrau and DiDonato is still the better I feel.",1397347200,3,607,6.117647058823529
