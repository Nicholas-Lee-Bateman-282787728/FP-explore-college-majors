7959247,4,B000063K2H,"This is a 2-pack collection includes Maetel Legend and Harlock Saga.  Both DVDs are available individually.  It is an odd choice to bundle these two DVDs together because, other than being the creations of Matsumoto Leiji, they are not the parts of the same story.
Maetel Legend tells of the origin of Maetel and the pirate queen Emereldas.  It is a nice offering by Matsumoto, and serves as a prequel to his masterpiece Galaxy Express 999.  Maetel does appear very briefly in Harlock Saga, and Emereldas has a slightly larger role.
Harlock Saga is a feature piece for Matsumoto's famous Captain Harlock.  Matsumoto took the story and music of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and recast the parts with his own characters.  Captain Harlock, Tochiro and Emereldas face off against Wodan and the Norse gods.  It is grand space opera.
The individual DVDs are great, and worth getting.  This is a nice way to get them together, although Harlock Saga has been available for some time.  Just don't expect the stories to be related.
Enjoy!",1015372800,9,1032,4.851428571428571
