5970856,5,B00F98FNRS,Each movie comes on a separate disk. I wanted to own these movies on Blu-ray for some time and this one collection is really good,1385856000,8,129,4.2
5970857,5,B00F98FNRS,"Three slices of fried gold are what I call the movies in this collection. I can't really decide which I like the best because each definitely has its own special ""flavor"". Despite sharing  hilarious comedy gags and themes of maturity & friendship.

Shaun of the Dead - is a love letter to George Romero Zombie films & the movie that serves to introduce the talented team of: Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg & Nick Frost to mainstream audiences.

Hot Fuzz - is a hilarious nod to buddy cop films & has a lot of great over the top action.

The World's End - wraps up ""The Trilogy"" and is another great nod to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Also serving to prove that you really can't go home again.

This Blu-ray collection is also packed with extras for each film giving the fan plenty of behind the scenes Cornetto comedy.",1384905600,46,816,4.449664429530201

5970867,5,B00F98FNRS,"This disk set is perfect, especially with the additional features and commentary. I absolutely adore this director and the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" as a whole. I could rave about the intelligent humor and political/social comedy, as well as the phenomenal use of objects and set design and cinematics to incite laughter without dialogue, but I think this review is more for the product. Thus, I'll say that this is a great collection for the price and I'll probably get it again as a ""just because"" gift for a fellow fan.",1524787200,,515,4.797752808988764

5970879,3,B00F98FNRS,"As others have said - the codes were expired. I only buy blu rays with UV codes because so many of my disks get destroyed by the kids.

Really not impressed on the UV code expiry thing - it's happened with movies I've bought from Amazon before. Why would you ever have an expiry date? And Amazon, why would you sell this without telling customers that this was the case?

So let me get this straight - you create a UV system so people can buy movies and counter the online illegal copying threat, and you reward my legal intention and honesty by selling goods with expired codes? It's bad customer karma, that's what it is. Sort it out. I won't tell you again.

Bit of shame because for the low price I paid, these are great movies - Hot Fuzz especially is awesome and entertaining - absolutely love it. Really original story and a boatload of fun.",1522108800,2,848,4.3544303797468356

5970982,5,B00F98FNRS,"All three of these movies are fantastic. Theyre charming, witty, and have tremendous rewatchability. Ive probably seen each of them at least five times, and every time Ive picked up on something new that I missed previously. Its great, and keeps the movies fresh well after the first viewing.

They come in a single case, one movie on each disc. It may be just me, but it seems a bit sturdier than other multi-disc cases I have.

The digital versions come as codes on a paper insert. The insert doesnt have an expiration date printed on it. Instead, you should go to NBCUcodes.com to check the expiration date for particular movies. The insert will suggest you redeem the codes at UniversalDigitalCopy.com, but you can also use them to add to iTunes directly. Its worth noting that you can redeem an Ultra Violet copy on Universal, Vudu, or Flixter Video as well as a digital copy on iTunes.

Sometimes combo packs have a code specifically for that collection of movies, but my insert had each of the movies as a separate code. I already had a copy of The Worlds End on iTunes, so its nice that I can give this copy to someone else without losing out on the other two movies.

All in all this is a fantastic deal on a great set of films. I would definitely recommend this trilogy pack if you enjoy the Cornetto trilogy.",1494028800,,1319,4.506276150627615

5970986,5,B00F98FNRS,"This Simon Pegg-Nick Frost trilogy is one of two things: Wonderful or awful.
I say that because there doesn't seem to be much middle ground when it comes to these three films. Folks love them or hate them but very few (at least of my acquaintance) are neutral about them.
Personally, I think they're wonderful. They are inventive, well-written, and well acted with great supporting casts including Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, and Jim Broadbent. Although I like all three, I especially like ""Hot Fuzz"" because it has - in my opinion - one of the great shootouts in film history.
(I know what you're thinking: This is a comedy, not an action movie but - frankly - I don't think that matters. When you watch Pegg and Frost, as a couple of local cops, take on a whole bunch of heavily armed bad guys in a running gun battle you've got to admire not only the action but also the realism of it. People actually run out of ammunition during the gunfight, when they get wounded they fall down in agony... I mean, compare that with your average cop movie or western.) Dalton, as one of the villains, has seldom been more menacing than he is in this film and Broadbent, known mostly for his roles as a gentle good guy, is convincing as a cop who has lost his way and gone to the dark side as the result of a personal tragedy.
""Shaun of the Dead"" is - as the title implies - a zombie movie. It's funny but it's not a spoof on the genre. In fact, it manages to combine laughter with a certain amount of pathos. It speaks to some interesting issues as well: The value of friendship, the willingness to sacrifice oneself for friends and loved ones, and the need for ordinary men and women to step up in times of an emergency.
""The World's End"" is not a zombie film, but it does borrow some elements of that genre in this science fiction tale of an alien attempt to take over Earth. Like the other two films, it has its comedic moments but it also has its share of pathos. The plot revolves around a former high school hotshot (Pegg) who organizes an epic pub crawl to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the last time he and a few friends were all together. Predictably, it goes horribly wrong. A little slow to start, the action and the pace of the movie picks up about halfway through and rushes to its conclusion at a breakneck pace. Former Bond Girl Rosamund Pike is wonderful as the hotshot's one-time lover who he dumped rather unceremoniously 20 years earlier. She's funny, tough when it counts, and - in the end - willing to forgive Pegg's character when the chips are down.
Not for everyone, this is a three-film collection for those who (like me) enjoy movies featuring broad-based humor mixed with enough pathos to separate them from slapstick comedies.",1493164800,,2764,4.486111111111111

All three of these movies are amazing each one as a diffrent genre like shaun of the dead is a horror comedy, hot fuzz is a action comedy, and the world's end is kind of a sci fi comedy.

5971017,5,B00F98FNRS,"Great movies. They basically invented romzomcom (romantic zombie comedy), made a perfect buddy cop movie, and a good apocalyptic action flick.
Shaun of the dead is by far my favorite, with HF 2nd. I own shaun on dvd and when it got scratched i was devastated, as i watch it mutiple times a month ( love the commentary).
So when i saw the 3 pack on here i couldn't say no, what a great deal, as right now the worlds end is almost 20$ at walmart.
They all have tons of features, gag reels, interviews, all the inside bits youd want from a movie. But the movies themselves are the best. I could watch shaun of the dead every day for the rest of my life and never get bored. Same goes for hot fuzz. Worlds end is good, but not my fav.
The movie is a great deal, for all the content you could have yourself a nice little marathon with trivia at the end. The discs came quick, no damage to the package. Great job.",1488672000,,907,4.129943502824859

But I couldn't find it. I saw it being sold for $9 on DVD but I really wanted that blu-ray. Then I saw this trilogy pack and I was like ""cool""...then I saw it was under 16 bucks and I was all ""shut the front door!!!"" Three Edgar Wright films for this price?! It's amazing! Especially considering the fact that I was more than willing to shell out 20 for just one!

Anyway, I watched all three films this week and they ran perfectly! The case and discs were in pristine condition, and I'm excited to watch the special features along with being able to rewatch the films for all of eternity.",1488499200,3,770,4.195945945945946

I already own Shaun of the Dead which I love and I had seen Hot Fuzz before which I really like, but The World's End really quite sucked. I even watched it twice to give it a decent chance, but it sucked as much the second time as it did the first. It's depressing and overkill and drags on and on with no end in sight. The best part was at the very end when Simon Pegg makes his final appearance.  I'm not sure if it was the best part because of Pegg's newfound emotional ""strength"" or because I knew it was almost over!",1474848000,,587,4.060344827586207

5971134,5,B00F98FNRS,"I got this alone for shaun of the dead adn the fact that there are digital downloads with all of these, but with that said I do love the two actors in these movies, especially simon pegg.  Hot fuzz was definitely my least favorite of the three, but worlds end was surprisingly cute and funny.  Of course there's shaun, which is one of my top three zombie films, although not scary, its so cute that you can't love it. any fan of british humor should and would enjoy this box set as these guys are hilarious in what they do and how they deliver their comedic styles.

For anyone who knows nothing of the movies

Shaun of the dead is about Shaun and his friends campy reaction to a zombie out break happening around them.  I think the thing I love about it the most is that its probably a realistic take on how I would handle a zombie invasion.  Its super funny and campy.

Worlds End is about a group of guys who try to go on a beer bust of all the bars in a section where they live and end up at the bar called worlds end.  After trying it years prior and failing, Simon Pegg plays a loser character who tries to rally the old gang up to finally do it one last time, however in the process they run into an interesting situation that throws them off track.

Hot Fuzz is basically a cop movie where two hapless cops transferred to a quite and quaint town where they suspect something evil is happening in a mayberry like town.

5971187,5,B00F98FNRS,"There was not a good low profile trilogy since the Colors Trilogy in the 90's.
The three movies were directed by EDGAR WRIGHT and started with Simon Pegg & Nick Frost, the dinamic duo of british comedy films.
The three films have available U-CONTROL, so you can see special featurettes during the film, only for Universal's Blu rays.
The first film SHAUN OF THE DEAD in 2004 was an outbreak, a comedy film with zombies, there are not good comedy films with zombies except for ZOMBIELAND in 2009 and WARM BODIES in 2013.

5971191,5,B00F98FNRS,"I remember buying my husband for a birthday a while back the special edition hot fuzz dvd set which he thoroughly enjoyed. Since then, we haven't gotten around to buying either hot fuzz or Shaun of the Dead on Bluray since a deal never really came up that interested me or him. Then comes along the Simon and Nick 3 movie set that sealed the deal. Great movies (haven't finished World's End so can't speak on that) to have on Bluray, especially for the price. And if you've never watched any of these movies, this is an excellent way to start. BTW, you should watch Paul as well.",1433289600,,579,4.37037037037037

5971244,2,B00F98FNRS,"These are three of the best movies ever. I can't recommend them more. However, I purchased this expecting to have an UltraViolet code. They actually didn't include a code at all. So I'm contacting them to ask for a code. But because of the false advertisement, I have to give it a low score. I was incredibly disappointed when I opened the box. But like I said, these are three of the greatest movies and you should absolutely watch them.",1429488000,3,438,4.4875
5971245,5,B00F98FNRS,"This is a terrific repackaging of the so-called Cornetto Trilogy, three films directed by Edgar Wright, written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.  Each takes an element of a hackneyed B-move genre and turns the conventions upside down with twisted dark comic genius.  Somehow at the same time, the movies manage to be worshipping homages to the styles they are spoofing.  And some of the cinematic craft is pretty staggering; the extended tracking shot (repeated) where Pegg's character goes to get Cornettos and Cokes in Shaun of the Dead and the introductory montage of Hot Fuzz are two pieces of sheer cinematic technical wizardry.  And their style and skill drew the cream of British actors into their cast; I can think of no other franchise that has major stars from the Indiana Jones series AND Harry Potter AND Lord of the Rings AND no less than two James Bonds.  Even if I think of Hot Fuzz as the gem of the collection and the one I'll keep going back to, I'm still glad to have the others.

This edition is everything you could hope for -- each Blu Ray is loaded with extras, there are digital copies, the video transfers and audio are terrific.  So, if you're as much of a film geek as Wright and Pegg and Frost are, and you love dark, twisted comedy, this set is for you.",1429488000,2,1321,4.525210084033613

5971304,5,B00F98FNRS,"This was a great way to pick up the Blu-Ray versions of two movies that I absolutely love, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  And for the decent price that was, they even threw in the World's End for free!  I'm kind of joking here, but WE just wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first two for me, that said, I certainly don't mind having it in the set.  I was first introduced to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's antics in SOTD, and immediately fell in love with their sense of humor.  They have a great chemistry on screen and it comes across in everything they do.  SOTD is still my favorite Zombie Romantic Comedy, and Hot Fuzz is just a fun excursion in to the English Country side.  I'll have to give World's End a few more views before I really cast any final judgement on it, but for all three movies this was really a great deal.",1424390400,,828,4.14375

5971329,5,B00F98FNRS,"Actor/writer Simon Pegg, actor Nick Frost, and director/writer Edgar Wright, combined their talents to create the Cornetto Trilogy of films included in this Blu-ray 3-disc set.  ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (2004) was an instant classic, combining the genres of romantic comedy with horror to great effect.  When Shaun first encounters the zombies, he doesn't even realize what is really going on.  To me, that demonstrates a Monty Python influence.  Of course, Shaun and his best friend Ed decide that the best place to take refuge in is the local pub called the Winchester.  When Ed tells Shaun's Mum ""We're coming to get you, Barbara,"" it's a nod to George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" (1968).  Early in that film, her brother intones ""They're coming to get you, Barbara...""  This is a must-see movie for me every October, when Halloween draws near.

""Hot Fuzz"" (2007) combines the genres of the action film and the buddy cop movie with horror.  Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a by-the-book, smart super-cop who is making the London police force look bad by comparison.  Nick is transferred to the rustic village of Sandford.  He is paired with the overweight, bumbling Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), who also happens to be the son of the local Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  All is not well in the seemingly ideal village, whose elder members will stop at nothing to win England's Village Of The Year award.  Timothy Dalton (a former James Bond) plays smarmy supermarket owner Simon Skinner.  Among the many grisly accidents that occur, his is the funniest!  Apparently,  director/writer Edgar Wright was interested in doing an action/buddy cop movie ever since he was a young lad.  One of the many bonus features is an amateur film called ""Dead Right,"" which he wrote and directed when he was only eighteen years old.

""The World's End"" (2013) combines the genres of the mid-life crisis movie with sci-fi.  Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a 40-something alcoholic whose glory days were in high school.  His dream is to reunite with four of his school chums, including Andy Knightley (Nick Frost), to complete the golden-mile pub crawl, by drinking twelve pints in twelve pubs in one night.  While the trouble-makers were gruesomely murdered in the previous movie, in this film, the imperfect humans are replaced by extraterrestrial robots with blue blood (or lubricating oil) coursing through their bodies.  Pierce Brosnan (a former James Bond) plays a teacher named Guy Shepherd, who has become one of the extraterrestrial replicates referred to as the blanks.  By the time Gary and Andy manage to reach the twelfth pub, called the World's End, they have a very close encounter with extraterrestrials that will change the world forever!  All three movies are loaded with bonus features, which help make this 3-disc set a very worthwhile purchase.",1421193600,,2856,5.027659574468085

5971377,5,B00F98FNRS,"Some people love the Star Wars trilogies, some like the Transporter trilogy (that's a bad example). I, for one, hold The Cornetto Trilogy as my absolute favorite threesome of classic films. From start to finish, each film delivers suspense, original stories and nonstop laughs. These are without a doubt the best comedy films to be released from England since Monty Python erupted the world with laughter when they released some of the greatest satirical films pushing boundaries not many comedians would have dared to cross in those times. Trust me, this trilogy is a definite must have for lovers of comedy and modern classics.",1418256000,,629,5.0576923076923075

5971386,5,B00F98FNRS,"This review isn't about the movies themselves but the overall value of the package you are looking at.  If you're looking at this 3-pack then chances are you already know whether you love or hate these movies.  $20.49 (price I paid on Amazon) would be a fantastic value alone just for the three Blu-Rays but the real selling point for me is the HD Digital copies that come with the package.  As an added surprise, you not only get your Ultraviolet copy but an iTunes (or windows media) copy as well.  For the very low asking price of this package, you not only get the complete three movies in physical media but an additional two sets for digital viewing.  This may not add value to all potential buyers, but if you live in a tech savvy home with multiple digital capable devices it is a fantastic value.  The digital copies alone when not on promotion run 3/4 the cost of this set per-movie.  With the risk of being too redundant, if you like these movies and enjoy having multiple ways to enjoy your collection, you cannot go wrong with this set.  For those concerned about compression and physical storage space, the movies are each on individual discs and the case is a standard single movie size case.",1414972800,,1207,4.529953917050691

5971389,5,B00F98FNRS,"This is a deal you can't pass up. If you love Edgar Wright movies, I don't know why you're even hesitating and reading reviews. The World's End, Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead are all included in this package in a beautiful HD format. The audio is great, the video quality is great, the laughs are great.

I won't review all three movies here, because there are plenty of reviews on the individual movie product pages, and there's too much to go over. But know that they're respectively an end-of-the-world scenario movie, a cop thriller movie, and a zombie apocalypse movie. They all have a similar hilarious style, and the humor moves so fast you'll have to pay close attention to not miss any jokes.

If you're a fan of this kind of humor like me, pick up this triple pack. You won't regret it!",1413936000,,798,4.458904109589041

5971401,5,B00F98FNRS,"I don't have much to say about the movies because if you have seen these you know they are terrific and if you haven't, you need to see them.

So I'll focus this review on the Blu-Ray.  The Quality is fantastic.  Sound is amazing.  And the fact that they come with a digital copy is the best of both worlds.  I have a pretty extensive DVD/BD collection but I also stream a lot too.  Streaming is great for convenience but the quality of the Blu-Ray is too good to pass up.  And at the price for a 3 pack, this is great.  I plan on getting a bigger TV and streaming just isn't going to look good unless I upgrade all my network gear and increase my monthly cost for bandwidth.

Basically, the quality of these Blu-Rays are so worth it.",1410998400,,734,4.148936170212766

5971407,4,B00F98FNRS,"I love the Cornetto Trilogy... my only complaint about this product is the blu-ray case.  It was broken when I received it... now I need to find another case.  I used to work at a dvd store, and in my experience when a movie case was broken for a particular movie, it wasn't uncommon that there would be multiple copies of the same movie with a broken case.

That was my only complaint about this product... the movies themselves are fantastic.",1408579200,,444,4.45679012345679

5971416,4,B00F98FNRS,"Three amazing movies all in one package. Plenty of features, too. I think this is basically just the previous blu-rays put into one case, so if you have any of them, it's probably not worth the buy, but if you don't then this is a MUST-HAVE for fans of Edgar Wright, Nick Frost, and Simon Pegg",1405641600,,293,4.25

5971422,5,B00F98FNRS,"I bought this set mainly for the Blu-ray edition of The World's End, but was extremely pleased with the quality of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, too.  Lots of extras for each film are included on the Blu-ray discs, and the picture and sound is a lot better than my well-worn DVDs could offer.  The films are on three separate discs (which I didn't realize when I scanned the description), so nothing at all seems to have been left out.  I already owned Shaun on DVD and the collector's edition DVD of Hot Fuzz, but I'm fairly certain that all of the bonus feature from that rather expensive set were on this 3-disc Blu-ray bargain.  I'm so happy I bought this set!  No complaints about this purchase...it was a wonderful bargain.",1403222400,,731,4.466165413533835

5971427,5,B00F98FNRS,"That's not an overstatement. These movies, good enough on their own, are only made better when watched together. Edgar Wright's unique style, Simon Pegg's impeccable comedic timing, and then absolutely absurd amount of  tributes and references to other films set this trilogy apart from any other.

All that to say, if you're considering buying this, just do it, you even get the digital copy with iTunes codes for free!",1402358400,,420,5.072463768115942

5971445,5,B00F98FNRS,"I love all of these films and this is a nice package if you do not have any of them on Blu-ray.  If you do have Shaun or Fuzz already on Blu-ray, sell them or give them away to those who have not had the privelage to see this group of talented people do their stuff.  For those of you who like these movies, seek out the actor's and director's work on IMDB to see more funny.  They all were in a series in England called SPACED and it is hands down the best show to come out in a long time.  They do sell it here on Amazon also.  Pegg and Frost also did a movie together called Paul, but it is not as good as the films in this collection.  Director Wright made a film called Scott Pilgrim vs. The World which I loved but is still growing on people after they realize what it was made to be.  If you have any of these three films individually, no need to double dip.  I don't think they added anything new for this collection.",1395100800,,925,3.962162162162162

Note that the movies are not a series. The characters in each one are different, even the the style of film is related, so you don't have to watch them in order.

If you know what you're getting into, or you are buying this as a gift for someone else, then stop reading reviews and just BUY IT already. Great movies. Blu-Ray. Simon Pegg. Enough said.",1394755200,,534,4.34
5971447,5,B00F98FNRS,"The uniting theme of ""growing up"" (or not, in in one case) that steers these movies is something that Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost cover very well.  I'd recommend Shaun of the Dead, The World's End, and Hot Fuzz, perhaps somewhat in that order.  The World's End was the one that surprised me the most, as I'd somehow managed to avoid all spoilers and the trailers as well, so I had no idea what was coming.  I'll leave it unmentioned in case you want to be surprised as well.  Shaun of the Dead is a little more obvious, and a fantastic movie.  Hot Fuzz starts slow but comes to a boil and has a very satisfying finale, IMO.  Oh, and technically all these movies look great and have lots of extras.  :-)",1394150400,,715,4.291044776119403

5971457,5,B00F98FNRS,"Simon and Nick have made three very funny satires of genre movies. Zombies, Cops, and Aliens. Hot Fuzz is the best film, I am horrified by The World's End's trivialization of Body Snatchers. But I have been horrified by all the other versions of Body Snatchers.
Shaun of the Dead has the most amusing premise, and best ending. I hope they continue making films, Simon is a very busy boy, appearing in other people's films.",1391299200,,422,4.64

I'm writing this to give people a heads-up about the digital downloads, which I had some issue with. For each movie you have a code that you can use on different sites (Amazon, iTunes, etc.). Not all movies are on every site, and not all of them have subtitle options. I was at my in-laws with no Blu-ray player and ended up being disappointed because I couldn't get Hot Fuzz with Spanish subtitles.",1390867200,,436,4.45
5971460,5,B00F98FNRS,"""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""...well, if you haven't seen them, you need to 'cause the 1st [S.o.t. D.] is essentially a cult classic at this point & personally, I actually liked Hot Fuzz possibly a wee bit more even.
I've yet to watch ""The World's End"" but, I imagine it'll be on par.
The only improvement for this 3-pack would be to have made it a 4-pack & included the movie ""Paul"" as well.
If you haven't seen ""Paul"" (esp. if you are a fan of Simon Pegg & Nick Frost &/or enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"", &/or ""Hott Fuzz"", et. al.)...""Paul"" is another movie that if you haven't seen it...get out from under your rock & watch it, eh? I think you'll like that one too!

Hot Fuzz kinda goes too long but, The Worlds End is just so much fun plus has a message to it. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a great team. And when they collaborate with Edger Wright they are the THE 3 flavors of The Cornetto trilogy. The Packaging of these 3 discs are decent although, I would have liked them in The order of oldest to newest when you open the box.

BTW I would not known about this product if it wasn't for OneOfUs.net's Popular podcast called Digital Noise. The The 2 MC's are fantastic and are great at what they do. So head on to that site.

5971468,5,B00F98FNRS,The perfect three movies! Love how each movie has own disc within the set.  It is a perfect gift for any fan of the duo.  The Worlds End is a perfect addition to have with Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.,1389225600,,203,3.8095238095238093
5971469,5,B00F98FNRS,"If you're buying this collection, it is obvious you're a fan of the Pegg/Frost/Wright movies. This review clarifies the bonus materials found in the Blu-Ray collection of the three movies in the ""Cornetto Trilogy.""

The product description is a little vague on the bonus materials that go with this release. Sometimes disk collections skimp on the bonus materials that are found in the normal release. Fortunately, this is not the case with this collection. The disks are loaded with commentaries, out takes, deleted scenes, featurettes, etc., etc., etc.

The back of the box indicates: ""Over six hours of apocalyptic bonus features! Including 9 feature commentaries, 11 featurettes, out-takes, deleted scenes and much, much more.""

By the way, if you finish these and want more of the same vein, you really must check out ""Spaced."" It was a 14-epidode TV series, and an absolute must for geeks that love Pegg/Frost/Wright creations.",1389225600,128,933,5.206666666666667
5971470,5,B00F98FNRS,we love watching movies with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in them. I would recommend this item to anyone who is a fan of these 2 men!,1389139200,,130,3.8518518518518516
5971471,5,B00F98FNRS,"Just as described, just as I expected. It was a Christmas present for my husband, and he loved it. Thanks!",1389052800,,106,4.35

5971473,5,B00F98FNRS,I think I am in love with Simon Pegg.  These are the funniest movies.  I just watch them over and over again.,1388707200,,109,3.909090909090909
5971474,5,B00F98FNRS,Son was very happy to get. Had never seen 3 of his favorite movie in one set. Was great gift.,1388620800,,93,3.7
5971475,5,B00F98FNRS,"The best blu-ray combo pack out there to date. Talented collaborators Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright deliver laughs, witty entertainment, and even a little inspiration for those who truly admire the art of genre filmmaking.",1388448000,,233,5.324324324324325
5971476,5,B00F98FNRS,"Great movies, but here in the US the Ultraviolet transfers of each film do not work in this region. Not a deal-breaker, but wish I would have known that prior to purchase.",1388361600,3,171,4.375
5971477,5,B00F98FNRS,My children have been wanting these movies for years and now we get them in one pack for a great price.,1388275200,,103,3.9523809523809526
5971478,5,B00F98FNRS,"This is a great DVD set to own with just one convenient case.  3 quality movies, that continue to be funny even after repeated viewing!",1388188800,,135,4.4
5971479,5,B00F98FNRS,"An unofficial trilogy that's officially recognized as one, the Wright/Pegg/Frost combination is one that has only bettered pop culture and movies. I won't get into which one's better, but I will say this collection keeps them together well and fits better on my self (limited space means I'm happy to have one case instead of three!)",1388188800,,333,4.964285714285714
5971480,1,B00F98FNRS,The DVD constantly stopped. Was unable to watch the movie very disappointed since it was the reason I bought the set. Haven't even bothered to try the others,1387929600,,157,4.642857142857143
5971481,5,B00F98FNRS,"Excellent bonus features and commentaries, great for fans of the movies. Also great for non-fans because that probably means you just haven't seen these yet and they're incredible movies.",1387843200,3,187,5.482758620689655
5971482,5,B00F98FNRS,"I'm a huge fan of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, not so much of the other movie, but it was still a very good deal to get all three. Came on time, also.",1387756800,,153,3.4
5971483,5,B00F98FNRS,Love these movies!  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring the laughs.  Guaranteed to make you laugh hysterically.  Dogs can look up!,1387670400,,126,4.904761904761905
5971484,5,B00F98FNRS,"I love this trilogy and it is well worth watching.  But a quick note for fans that have heard about director Edgar Wright's commentary with Quentin Tarantino that originally appeared on the Hot Fuzz DVD, where they talk about 200 movies over the course of the 2 hours.  It is NOT included in the Blu Ray that is part of this set.  Shame, but still a great set nonetheless.",1387584000,22,372,4.36231884057971
5971485,4,B00F98FNRS,So I was so excited to get this 3 disc set. The World's end was not what I was expecting but it was fun. I had already seen the other two and know they were great.,1387497600,,163,3.5555555555555554
5971486,5,B00F98FNRS,I love this set.  The only thing missing is Paul.  Guess I'll buy that next.  These movies are awesome and I am glad to get them on blue ray as a set for 10 bucks a piece.  What a deal.,1387238400,,185,3.55
5971487,5,B00F98FNRS,"There's nothing to add. The movies are extremely enjoyable, good old fashioned fun.

However, note that while the product description mention french sub/audio, it only applies to Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The World's End is only english and spanish.",1387152000,4,255,5.071428571428571
5971488,5,B00F98FNRS,"An amazing set of movies combined for a great price. I have yet to watch The Worlds End, but I'm very excited to see it!",1386806400,,120,3.84
5971489,4,B00F98FNRS,"Amazing movies.  It's a crime not to own all three.  World's End stands up to its predecessors.

I only wish there was a fancy box set of some kind, with perhaps more exclusive features, instead of just all three regular discs in a cardboard wrapper.",1386806400,2,250,4.511111111111111
5971490,4,B00F98FNRS,"These movies are a hoot. Not destined to be counted with the great classics, but something that will having you laugh out loud in places and smiling the rest of the time.",1386460800,,170,4.34375
8613277,1,B00F98FNRS,"Edgar Wright is an amazing director, and all three of these films are top notch. However amazon or the primary seller for amazon purposely removes disks and repackages these dvds. I got my copy with only The Worlds end and Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the dead nowhere to be found. Also no digital codes in the box",1532131200,,304,4.350877192982456
8613278,1,B00F98FNRS,"Like some of the other recent customers, mine came packaged very poorly (wrinkled label, half out of the plastic around the jewel case), and only had the Shaun of the Dead disc with no spot for any of the other discs. The item description clearly makes mention of three discs, and the package art clearly advertises three movies. When you open it up, guess what? One disc, and an insert to redeem the digital versions of the other two, as well as a digital version of Shaun of the Dead. If I wanted digital copies, I could have bought digital copies.

This is downright misleading, so if you're looking for a good collection of three amazing movies and you want physical discs, look elsewhere because with this one you're getting one disc and two digital copies. Will be returning this after I finish rewatching Shaun of the Dead.

Amazon, I would strongly advise you change your item description to stop lying to your customers. This is shipped from and sold by Amazon, so this is clearly your fault.

As for the movies themselves, Shaun of the Dead is one of the best zombie movies, Hot Fuzz is one of the best buddy cop movies, and World's End one of the best pub crawl movies. They're all great, and the duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is a slice of fried gold. If all of my discs were present, this collection would get 5/5 stars because these are three of my favorite movies of all time. As it stands with two missing discs and an item description that's an outright lie, it's 1/5 stars purely because I can't do 0/5 stars.",1532044800,,1530,4.437722419928826

8613280,1,B00F98FNRS,Mine arrived with only Shaun of the Dead disc.  Packaging did not have a slot for the other two discs and had scuff marks around the edges.  Clearly repackaged to be misleading.,1531958400,,177,4.5
8613281,5,B00F98FNRS,"The digital codes will work if you redeem them through iTunes.  If you have movies anywhere linked with iTunes and to your other accounts like amazon, vudu, and google they will show up there as well",1531872000,,199,4.527777777777778
