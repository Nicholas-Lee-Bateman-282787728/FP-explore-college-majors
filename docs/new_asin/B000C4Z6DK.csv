Squibs covers detailed concepts and terminology from a wide range of sciences.  I am reasonably well versed in the sciences, yet I learned new facts right along with the kids.

The Squibs producer don't pull any punches when it comes to providing correct information and terminology.  In fact, unlike many other science videos for kids that I've watched, I have yet to see inaccurate information in any of the Squibs videos.

The only negative aspect I see on these shows are some of the songs themselves.  In an effort to diversify the music and connect with modern music, some of the songs are hard to understand and feel disjointed.  One complaint I have seen is that the videos gloss over too much information to be useful.  One reviewer stated, ""It attempts to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds"".  This is a valid concern although I think misguided.  It does indeed cover a large amount of information in a short time, but it is not intended to be used in a vacuum.  Books, games, discussions, and repetition are critical to help your kids understand what has just been presented.  No video alone can teach them all they need to know about science.

Despite being a bit over their heads, my children (age 5 and 8) love these shows and watch them whenever they can.  They enjoy them, but most importantly, they are learning and remembering.

Yes, it's complex; yes, it's challenging; and yes, you may occasionally feel stupid watching it; but if the show doesn't challenge your kids to think and learn, what's the point of watching?",1183420800,2,1683,4.715753424657534
