6446293,2,B00KTOPHSC,"Expected this to be a cute kids show, and that's what it's trying to be, but instead it comes across as a sort of belittling of child psychological abuse and broken families.  After the fifth time Dracula tells his daughter that he doesn't love her, I was really done with this series.  Tried a few episodes, but it never got better.",1408233600,5,333,4.442622950819672

6446295,5,B00KTOPHSC,If only I hadn't discovered this show last week I might actually do something besides work and come home and watch it.  It is totally AWESOME!  Check out a sample online and then buy this.  You won't be disappointed.,1407369600,7,216,4.487179487179487
6446296,5,B00KTOPHSC,"Started watching this because I was bored and like vampire shows. However, I was instantly drawn in by the humor and the characters. After all 5 seasons, I am thoroughly saddened that it ended. Keith-Lee Castle is an amazing actor whom made me laugh and brought up deep emotions time and time again. Young Vlad really grew as a character. Ingrid did as well, it wasn't until the end of the 5th season that I started liking her, but I am glad I decided to take a chance on this show.",1492992000,2,482,4.3076923076923075

6446301,4,B00KTOPHSC,"The first episode is too childish, but the second one was better.  Hoping it continues to improve in the humor dept.  This is a very nice change of pace from all the dark horror that is part of the vampire genre of our time.",1483401600,,224,4.068181818181818

6446309,3,B00KTOPHSC,"It never gets really good or really poor.  The acting averages out as mildly comic, but it's uneven.  The premise is obviously copied from ""The Addams Family"" or ""The Munsters"", both of which were better written and acted.  I am surprised, to be truthful. TV producers have had almost two generations of time to refine and improve upon those originals.",1481241600,,352,4.833333333333333

6446328,5,B00KTOPHSC,"A witty take on the Dracula legend. To escape a howling peasant mob the Draculas migrate to the UK in their old hearse--no problems with stowing away on lorries in the Chunnel for them! Young Dracula rebels against the family tradition and wants to be a proper schoolboy doing homework and making friends. Dad soon foregoes the delights of hunting humans in favor of TV. Mom runs off with a werewolf but might follow the others to their greener pastures of Albion. Young D's sister wants to kick him out of his room but Dad unashamedly plays favorites for his son and--he hopes--his heir (if only he can get the little blighter to take an interest in flying and feasting on postmen).  if you have a sense of humor and aren't expecting a soapy Hollwyood TV saga, you should enjoy this.",1472515200,,784,4.560283687943262

6446367,5,B00KTOPHSC,"I watched the first episode on a lark and thought, ""that was stupid- one star!."" Kept watching, for no apparent reason, and somehow started liking it; Not that I would admit this to anyone I actually know!

For whatever the reason the characters kind of grew on me. Still not crazy about Zolton though. I could do without him. YD is very well cast in my opinion, and the low budget feel it has is really perfect for the script story line. It doesn't try to be more than it is and maybe that's why it kind of works for me. Think Munsters or Adams Family in the 21st century. How will will a single parent vampire and his two completely different children fit in to a quiet British neighborhood?

Rated G. Mostly silly. Never gruesome as such but some of the images might be scary for the youngest kids imo. And some of the early season 2 episodes have some dark moments, maybe more like pg where younger ones are concerned. Just depends on what you want and allow- but for the most part it is very tame and never gets really intense or anything- just a little on the scary/gruesome side but then gets quickly resolved with no tragic outcomes.

Update; I'm halfway thru S-3 which picks up afer an @4 year hiatus. Vlad is older and the shows rating has gone from G to NR. A bit less fun plus there was a very ot of the blue f-bomb in Ep 5 I think it was. So if you are watching this just be prepared that in a flash this show goes from a kid theme to more of a teen theme. All the things you might like a about the first two seasons such as Van Helsing, the wacky neighbors, the castle, Stokely etc...are gone.

6446403,5,B00KTOPHSC,"I loved this series. I'd never heard of it until I stumbled across the title here on Amazon, but I enjoy BBC series from time to time and decided to give the show a chance. At first, I worried that it might be ridiculous, as it's about a young boy and most shows directed at children seem to be a waste of time these days, but then I remembered that I was a child at heart and that I don't care if I'm wasting my time so long as I'm enjoying myself.

While the first season is quite light and comical, it's entertaining and has an interesting plot. The story-line continues onto the second season, where it begins to develop into more than just a funny show. I imagine it was written with the expectation of appealing to the changing tastes of the children who watched the first season. (Much like the plot of Harry Potter in that aspect, I think.)

The story is interesting, the cast is wonderful, I loved the dialogue, the characters and the humor, and by the time I arrived at the last season, I was disappointed to realize that it was almost over.

I would highly recommend this series. (Especially to those who consider themselves to be a child at heart!)

6446411,1,B00KTOPHSC,"They say this was a big hit in Britain... but I didn't find anything funny in the first episode. The premise is a little off-beat: The Dracula family is run out of Transylvania by a peasant mob and move to England. Where Dracula's young son hopes he can finally be normal. Humor ensues. Well, should ensue, but doesn't really. I understand the show is aimed at a younger audience.

6446416,5,B00KTOPHSC,"LOVED IT!!!! It's kind of feels like the Addams Family or Munsters. It's a 'kid' show that is actually very progressive in some aspects. I like how the characters have depth and that there aren't just ""this guy BAD""... ""this guy GOOD"". The good guy can have flaws and the bad guy can have virtues.

It was most often hilarious, especially Reincliff and Count Dracula. I loved their characters. I wish to see more seasons of this show but I guess it finished with season 4. This show had plenty of humor as well as a bit of everything (romance, betrayal, intrigue, etc.) but no gory stuff. It was all done in excellent taste. Most British comedies and satires are so well done! This one is on top of my list. It's the type of show that leaves you wanting more and makes you wish that it would never end.

I would have to say that this show is for ages 15 and up. Great humor, that is most certainly missed by the special people that gave it 1 star. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series!

6446526,4,B00KTOPHSC,This is a great show.  All ages can enjoy the nutty humor and clean language this show has. Young boys and men with open and adventurous minds would probably enjoy this show and it would be a nice change from all the living dead shows that are too scary for me and I'm over 60 years old.

6446530,4,B00KTOPHSC,A very funny send-up of the vampire genre. It's actually a family appropriate show in the PG 13 range. I like a good vampire movie and they are few and far between. This show amuses me because it's so silly. I can watch it before going to sleep. I really like Zoltan the stuffed wolf. He cracks me up!!,1424390400,,302,4.135593220338983

6446533,5,B00KTOPHSC,"This show is unexpectedly great. It hits just the right balance of campy scenario without having vampire characters that are completely ridiculous. Count Drac (as a sort-of-scary, extremely old-fashioned single father) has a couple of satisfying (but brief) scary moments, and it's often his 'antics' that keep the show moving forward. He's played with quite a bit of flair, but he's still a powerful, old-school vampire. And the kids all hold their own with their respective story lines, which are all very different, and so help keep the show interesting. It's a family show, with some moments that might be too intense (as in potential lives-in-danger scenarios) or gross (mostly Renfield's cooking) for young children, but perfectly fine for the age group at which it's targeted (say 10 and up).  I'm a grown-up vampire fan, and have just started the second season. Definitely worth a look.",1424390400,10,894,5.123287671232877

6446560,4,B00KTOPHSC,Been watching this show with the niece and nephew and I find this show hilarious.  Some very dark moments for a kids show (talk about feeding on peasants and blood--well it is Dracula) which makes me not too sure about very young children watching.  However it is a good show for the tweens and teenagers as well as adults too.  My niece did not quite get the interaction between the count and his daughter--she did feel there should be a more authoritative lady on the show.  I told her it's a comedy so take it as it is as it wasn't meant to be true to life.  We all get a kick out of it--good fun.,1414108800,4,600,4.137931034482759
6446561,4,B00KTOPHSC,"As an American who grew up on the Munsters and loved the Adams Family, I have to say that Young Dracula met every expectation I've had for a children's show. The acting can be a bit over the top at times, but it all serves to put everything into silly extremes. The Count is just loveable enough to not be completely evil, and Reinfeld is so gross! Ingrid is an ambitious vampire who unfortunately is a woman in a Count's world. That she embodies all that the Count wants in a child, but is still ignored is a great laugh. Vlad, the heir, only wants to be normal, and constantly runs afoul of the Count's plans for him.
All in all, it's a good laugh, with none of the trash that seems so prominent in today's childrens shows.

Updated. Beginning with season 3, this show takes a much more mature tone, morphing from a pre-teen show into a teen drama. There are still hints of the earlier comedic tones, but overall, the show becomes inappropriate for younger viewers who may not understand the more mature themes.",1413936000,9,1013,4.446236559139785
