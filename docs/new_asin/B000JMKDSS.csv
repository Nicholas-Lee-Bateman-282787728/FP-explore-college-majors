8152326,1,B000JMKDSS,"In retrospect, we can look back and laugh at the plethora of predictions in the early 1990's that the sudden abundance of camcorders would seed a guerilla-training revolution for a new generation of ultra-skilled filmmakers.  There were many film industry pundits who suggested that thousands, nay millions, of kids from New Mexico to Saskatchewan would hone extraordinary video story-telling skills as a result of growing up with easy access to video recording capabilities.  Unfortunately, we've yet to see such a revolution, and if SERUM is the best camcorder movie to emerge from suburban Dallas, then true Hollywood movie-making professionals have nothing to fear.  If this were a true feature production, with real equipment, real actors, maybe even a story, I would not be writing a negative review.  I know how hard it can be to produce a real film, and I respect those that accept the challenge.  But SERUM is a camcorder fiasco.  No professionals would be hurt by an honest review.  So let me tell you this:  water-boarding torture would be a better way to spend 90-minutes.  Seriously, someone in Dallas owes me back 90+ minutes of my life, wasted from misleading (but graphically strong) packaging art.  Amazon.com customers be warned.  Oh, but they're not?  Amazon.com does not (yet) require that the video format device be disclosed on product listings, thus creating a horribly deceptive impression that the 4K HD video format used for movies like SOCIAL NETWORK is somehow comparable to the home-video camcorder format used for disasters like SERUM.  Amazon, anyone listening?  Please protect your customers.",1296000000,,1624,5.22007722007722
8152327,2,B000JMKDSS,"SERUM is basically about a doctor named Dr. Eddie Kanopolus (David H. Hickey) who is obsessed with developing a miracle drug that can cure any disease. When his funding suddenly becomes jeopardized and his nephew is hit by a vehicle and puts him into a coma, he's forced to do something drastic to find the final ingredient for his serum: brain fluid from a live human. His experiment eventually goes wrong, creating a zombie-like creature that goes on a brain-eating rampage in the nearby town. There's also a subplot with his nephew (also named Eddie) and his girlfriend making amends, trying to patch up a relationship gone bad.

I've never been big on Medical Horror and after watching SERUM, I came to the conclusion that based on the script, it had the potential to be mediocre at best but even failed to do that. This movie just stinks. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen and it had some decent moments in it, but it just failed on so many levels. I won't get into the low quality of the film, because it IS a low budget Indie horror film after all, and poor film quality usually comes with the territory. But there are some scenes that are so grainy that it makes the film look like it was made in the 80's. Also I'm curious as to how they cast this movie because most of the actors are terrible. Hickey did a good job as Dr. Kanopolus and even actor Derek Phillips did a pretty good job as the young Eddie, but for the most part the rest of the cast was terrible. However, all of the women in the film are super hot and we do get some obligatory nudity. My BIGGEST problem with the film was the directing and the editing. It's like there was absolutely no intention of making this film scary with how it was all presented. From the characters to the killer zombie to the gore, it was all just way too corny. Even the cheap scares aren't effective. And the ending is so dumb that it appropriately puts the final nail in the coffin of a movie that gets worse just when you think it COULDN'T.

There are movies that are so bad that they're good and there are some movies that are just bad period. This is one of the movies that's just BAD. It's just a below average Medical Horror movie with no real entertaining moments, no scary moments, below average gore, and moments that attempt to be funny but end up failing. The verdict: Don't bother.

8152328,1,B000JMKDSS,"The video is so much worse than bad it's not even funny.  I made it less than five min. before throwing this movie away.  Seriously it was as if someone built a time machine, went back to 1913, purchased a, then top of the line camera, which is the equivalent to video from a cell phone 5 years ago, filmed a movie for idiots in the worst quality imaginable.  Why didn't they use the time machine to go into the future, grab one of those space cameras that I've been reading so much about and film an idiot movie in the best possible quality.  Even better than that they could even film it in the future, since it's the future, they could find the 2 idiots that actually like this movie and work them in as extras, of course they might be too busy ""making a family"" with their cousins, and not even one of the hot ones, but the one that always has a rash.",1215043200,,855,4.132530120481928
8152329,1,B000JMKDSS,"Maybe I'm burned out with movies with not much more than oodles of gore, but this one started off that way and ended for me that way: I turned it off after ten minutes. Just tired of this stuff from Hollywood.",1179878400,,209,4.121951219512195
8152330,3,B000JMKDSS,"This low budget indie hearkens back to some of the similarly-themed films of the 60s, like HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM.  In SERUM, a mad doctor thinks he has developed a serum that will cure cancer; in actuality, it merely makes the subject puffy and homicidal, and oh yes, cannibalistic.  The good doctor decides that to make it work he needs live subjects rather than corpses.

Woven into this plot is the story of handsome, nice young Eddie, the doctor's nephew, who has been accepted into medical school.  One night while walking home drunk from a club, he is struck by an automobile and near death.  Guess what the good uncle decides to do?

Derek Phillips (from TV's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) has an honest likeability and does well; the rest of the cast is pretty weak.  SERUM certainly sets no new standards for horror films but it's entertaining if you enter without any expectations.",1176249600,,888,4.7272727272727275
8152331,4,B000JMKDSS,"This film was just plain fun. You can't take it too seriously. A wacky doctor (and this guy was out there) drills into people's heads to find the answer to immortality. When he uses it on his nephew things go horribly wrong...of course! It was funny (a guy has to stay in college another year after he spends his tuition money on breast implants for his girlfriend - classic!) and it had some really great gory scenes. The pacing was good -- the movie moved along well -- and the acting was good. I'm not saying it was the best movie ever, but I enjoyed it. And for a low budget movie, it was better made than most.",1171238400,4,615,4.220338983050848
8152332,4,B000JMKDSS,"I love movies but am not a big fan of horror films. However, many of my students love them and tell me I should see this one or that one, which I do from time to time. I watched ""Serum"" and was greatly surprised. Naturally, there was the gore and violence that I do not normally like, but the film also had a story, which was refreshing. The filmmaker created an interesting plot and took time to develop the characters, which made you more invested in them. Obviously, it was a small budget film, but it didn't matter because you liked the characters and wanted to find out what was going to happen next. And, I thought the production value was better than many other independent movies I've seen.",1170720000,3,698,4.4186046511627906
8152333,5,B000JMKDSS,"Kudos to director Steve Franke for crafting a credible and entertaining horror-thriller with ""SERUM.""  The film holds it's own against mainstream theatrical horror films such as ""SAW"", ""HOSTEL"" and the thematically similar ""DAWN OF THE DEAD.""  However, where these others may excel in graphic violence (not my favorite element), ""SERUM"" beats them with humor and plausibly absurd circumstances that catch the viewer by surprise while delivering an equal jolt of shock and comedy.  It's a notable effort and evidences a bright future for director Franke given perhaps a larger budget or a less formulaic structure.  All told, well worth watching.",1170115200,5,645,5.42
8152334,2,B000JMKDSS,"This movie starts out really slow and is boring most of the whole movie. It is about a 17 year old boy who eventually gets hit by a car in the middle of the movie, before that it is just non since with his ex girl friend, school etc.. and his uncle being a Surgeon sais that he can cure him and tells the guys dad who is also a doctor also, to trust him. The boy is in a coma and is not hopeful to make it and they have him removed from the hospital and took to his uncles lab. He calls in a stripper and kills her to use her blood, etc to inject and use in the boy and it works! He wakes up but he starts killing people and feeding off of them, including his uncle. He goes back to normal for a short while and then his head swells up and he starts feeding again. The movie is ridiculously funny the way his head swells up and everything looks so fake! I have seen worse movies and more boring movies than this but not a lot. This movie is poorly thought out and boring, I kept wanting to fast foward the dvd to skip over the boring parts!!",1169596800,4,1041,3.869158878504673
