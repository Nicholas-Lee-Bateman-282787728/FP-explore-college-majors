1785991,5,B00006LPKA,"To put this into perspective, I don't like many movies much at all and usually pan them. I only watch movies because they are inexpensive (I got this one free) and I don't really pay close attention, they are on the TV while I work online. I would not have bet a dollar to a hundred dollars I would rate something like this as five stars. My only caveat is that you probably should be a boxing fan to start with.

Yes I am familiar with the stars but it was not until it was over and I saw the credits that I understood how this became a first rate exercise in drama and action. Directed by Walter Hill (Alien, The Warriors), music by the great Stanley Clarke. There isn't a boring moment, it does not rely on cheap sensationalism, it does not belabor stereotypes. It is very straightforward. Don't look for lessons or morals, it is not about that. There isn't anyone to cheer for. It is simply pure realism in the modern world. A few things are stretched a bit but the only thing that is really impossible is only in the last minute and basically an afterthought. Director Hill said that when he made ""The Warriors"" he envisioned it as a comic book story. Maybe the same here. It works.

Working from the premise that movies are made for people who like such kinds of movies, I see no reason to rate less than five stars.",1434412800,,1322,4.305220883534137

Superb casting in secondary roles. Sample scenes: The irony of prisoners singing a rap version of Star Spangled before the fight; Faulk's tirade/f-bombs soliloquy, Snipes' declining ""assistance"". Greatly underrated, for one reason, because many have never even heard of it.

Not to be confused with the Undisputed II (2007) and Undisputed III (2010) pieces of crap.

This is a Ving Rhames flick and the guy does a credible job as a champion wrongly convicted and sent to a maxx prison and forced to establish himself as a tough criminal while at the same time continue his boxing career in the prison system's underground fight scene.  The fights are passable, but it's the machinations of the various shady characters that steal the show.  I say rent it!",1383696000,,546,4.484848484848484

1786114,5,B00006LPKA,"Back in the 1940-1950s, boxing movies were a dime a dozen.  Often, they were done on a low budget or what they called back then ""B"" movies.

There was a formula to boxing movies: it was corrupt and an innocent victim usually the boxer himself ending up either in jail or fighting to save his life at the expense of gangsters who fixed fights in order to make money.  Sometimes, the boxer would be caught in a love triangle between two women: A good girl who had his best interests at heart; and the bad girl who was beautiful, sultry and toyed with the fighters affections usually at the behest of the gangster.  In the end, a moral was taught and the fighter came out OK in the end.  In short, boxing was a metaphor for life:  someone who with will and determination triumphed over adversity and lived to see a better day.

Fast forward now to 2002.  Times have changed and the formula has changed with it.  The boxing movie of today has to have edge, attitude but underlying the basic theme, the metaphor or life still applies.

We have in Ving Rhames, somewhat of a Sonny Liston character toughened to the point that nothing affects him and he  won't be intimidated.  Success in the ring hasn't softened him one bit.

On the other end, we have Wesley Snipes; a fighter of great promise only to have everything cut short because of murder.  Snipe's character too is toughened because of bitterness over what could have been and instead of riches and fame, he has to settle for being the ""baddest man in the prison system"".

I'm not going to give away the whole scenario here but if you are a boxing fan and that includes collecting boxing movies, then this movie is a MUST.  It's well done and the production values are good and the fight scenes are realistic and believeable.

Peter Falk who is the ""boxing historian"" of the prison sets the rules NOT using Marquis de Queensbury rules.  The outcome I won't give away but if you want a good second movie to go along with ""Cinderella Man"" or ""Raging Bull"" or even ""Rocky"" (some A list examples), this movie is for you.",1255132800,,2069,4.457446808510638
1786115,5,B00006LPKA,The movie's great came in just in time no scratches of any kind nothing more or less.,1247011200,,85,4.0588235294117645
1786116,4,B00006LPKA,"So, no, this isn't Jane Austen's UNDISPUTED. This is Walter Hill at the helm and he brings his own brand of taut urban grit to the film. UNDISPUTED is a prison drama, a boxing movie, and a character study. It's peopled by hardened characters you probably won't want to hang out with, except in the confines of cinema.

It's exciting times at the Sweetwater correctional facility, up in the Mojave Desert, and specifically for the California State Inter-Prison Boxing Program. George ""Iceman"" Chambers (Rhames), the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, just pulled a Mike Tyson and now comes to Sweetwater to serve out his sentence. The Iceman, new rooster in the crib, promptly learns that the prison system already boasts its own undisputed champeen, Monroe Hutchen (Snipes), a onetime ring prospect sentenced to life ten years ago, and without parole. Hutchen's boxing record also renders him undefeated. This doesn't sit too well with the Iceman, and dude is quick to challenge Hutchen for his place in the pecking order. Stoking the situation is a shambling old mobster, a bigtime boxing fan, who schemes to pit these two hard dudes against each other. And there's your movie.

Iceman wasn't that far wrong when he said that ""People love a guy who can fight."" I'm a diehard boxing fan, so UNDISPUTED caught my attention when it came out. UNDISPUTED is lean and economical; it doesn't waste time getting down to business. And I appreciate it not only for its intense character play but also for its occasional referencing of old school pugilists (Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, etc.). Walter Hill, director of some of my favorite action films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warriors-The-Ultimate-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000A6T1JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warriors (The Ultimate Director's Cut)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/48-Hours/dp/B0019EY020/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">48 Hours</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Fire/dp/0783227876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Fire</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trespass/dp/B0000VV5DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trespass</a>), has a knack for drawing out the brawny fan joy in a guy. In UNDISPUTED, he gradually builds things up for the inevitable fighty fight. More of a drama, not a lot of sustained action, other than Iceman and Hutchen's respective matches at the start of the film (to establish their fighting creds) and then the big crunching bout at the end. In between is plenty of prison politics and mind games, posturing and quick bursts of aggresiveness, mostly perpetrated by the Iceman, all of which scenes are quite fascinating.

Wesley Snipes gets top billing but has the less showy role. Even though the introspective, solitary Monroe Hutchen is the prohibitive protagonist, he doesn't come across as the classic hero type. Recalling that Monroe Hutchen was convicted of murder, I guess we eye him as the protagonist mainly because he exudes a calm, nonaggresive demeanor and because he's seen as the underdog (the Iceman outweighs him by a bunch). Ving Rhames, early on tapped as the volatile big bad, actually gets more screen time than Snipes. I like that the Iceman isn't the typical dumb heavy; he demonstrates a certain cunning, as he negotiates with or unleashes violence on the Sweetwater denizens. The Iceman realizes that his fellow inmates continually look to test him. That he's so willing to start shiznit isn't as indicative of his innate brutality as much as it is a course of action he feels he has to take to survive in penitentiary. Rhames' two encounters with Snipes (the cafeteria and shower scenes) before the bout are memorable and fraught with tension.

So, yeah, a menacing Ving Rhames and a resolute Wesley Snipes drive the film. But there's a peppering of interesting supporting characters, with Fisher Stevens, Michael Rooker, and Jon Seda all getting chewy bit parts. But none of those are more colorful than Mendy Ripstein, that aged gangster convicted of tax evasion, played with wicked elan by Peter Falk. Allow me to inject my favorite quote from Falk's character: ""#@%$!!"" I've never seen the elderly cuss so much as Peter Falk. He drops so many F-bombs in one scene that I couldn't help crumbling with laughter. Not that I rub elbows with mobsters, but I thought Falk was quite convincing as an old wiseguy with clout. When the warden threatens to derail the upcoming bout, Ripstein tells his peeps: ""You know the drill. You help him... or you hurt him"" That's a cool line.

*** SPOILER in this paragraph *** If I remember my boxing urban legend correctly, rumor was that, years ago, the retired Sugar Ray Leonard was contemplating a comeback but first wanted to test himself. He fought a closed doors match with someone and got his whatsis soundly beaten. Naturally, Sugar Ray denies this ever happening. UNDISPUTED shares something of that flavor. Snipes and Rhames put on a good tussle, both in tremendous shape and athletic enough to pull off the boxing thing. Snipes himself trained with renowned boxing trainer Emanuel Steward in prep for this role. And, while Snipes may be underweight in this bout, you have to be totally new to movies if you can't pick out the winner. At the end, the undisputed champion is the one still reigning in stir, while the other fella gets released from prison and regains his heavyweight crown. Except that, nowadays, he's also busy killing this rumor about how he got his whatsis handed to him, that one time behind bars.",1232150400,,5663,5.445330296127563

Fans of Peter Falk may want to check this out also... as he revisits his classic hard-boiled, wizened old guy role, this time in a much-aged version. The film wins points for being straight-forward and to the point... while still leaving ambiguities that keep it interesting and true-to-life, like what really happened with Ice Man's ""he said"" ""she said"" court case. The characters are presented simply, true-ly, and without a lot of bs or fluff. The filming and shoots are well-done, the characters and scenes believable. The action is linear and satisfying, and the film ends on a fine note. The only weakness is in the scene of the final fight. The fight is not interesting; except for the final few moments, you can hardly make out what they're doing, and it's not very dramatic. But overall, I would recommend this to fans of this genre.",1194912000,,927,4.658536585365853

Welsey Snipes & Ving Rhames together in a boxing / prison movie with a touch of Mafia...the mere thought is laughable (so is the fairy tale ""he lived happily ever after"" ending!! LOL), but I found the movie mildly entertaining, and shoot the price was right. On a scale of 1-5, I give the movie 2.5 stars, but it's not bad for the price.

And i have to say...I really like this movie.  I'm not a boxing fan, nor am i a fan of prison movies, but there's something about watching Wesley Snipes' understated performance as Huchens that captures my attention.  I also enjoyed the side characters (Falk as Mendy is hilarious) and it's their interaction with one another (Snipes and his sidekick Ratbag...lol...Rhames and his cellmate...what's his name?... bad guy from Last Mohicans...oh yeah...Studi) that really make the movie.

Although it might be argued that the Snipes character is the ""good guy"", there really is no full on bad guy.  Rather, you have a wonderful muddle of ambiguous characters. The sidekicks are interesting in that each seems better suited not for who he is paired up with, but for that opponent of that pairing.

Although the realistic fight at the end between reigning prision champ, Snipes and Challenger and former Heavyweight Champion of the world accused of rape, was worth the 1 1/2 hour watch. Some of the storylines in this movie is a bit zany and unauthorised charecters that make apearences in this movie enter then suddenly vanish from the script.

1786138,4,B00006LPKA,"""Undisputed"" is a Walter Hill film, which means it's about well-drawn characters, simple premise, and machismo.  Or especially the last thing.  Here you see Wesley Snipes as 'Champ of the prison boxing' (for 10 years) Monroe Hutchen, and Ving Rhames as 'the real Champ' or George 'Iceman' Chambers, who is convicted for rape charge.  But some say they don't need two champs, so they decide it by fighting.
So they fight, but not so soon.  A veteran prisoner named Ripstein (excellent Peter Falk, spitting out so many F-words) steps in, who truly loves the art of boxing, and he wants them to fight there, in the prison in the middle of the desert.  Surrounding the three main characters are Michael Rooker, Wes Studi, Jon Seda, Fisher Stevens, and Master P as special guest.
The story is so simple, but the point is not that part.  If you are looking for ""48 Hours"" it's not here.  Hill and co-writer David Glier opted for creating realistic characters instead of actions, so what you see first is not the names of the actors, but those of the characters.  They do not talk much about themselves, unlike many films of the genre, but you get to know them through the dialogues, uttered by well-chosen actors who can really act.
""Undisputed"" belongs to the genre (prison film); however, it never shows unnecessary digression in the short course of story, and Hill wants that way (see how Michael Rooker's character slyly refers to the genre itself).  It is not about a hero and a villain, it's about men's pride and dignity, and on that score it succeeds.",1074384000,,1553,4.7011070110701105

Mendy Ripstein (Peter Falk), a mobster convicted for tax eviction, is a devoted boxing fan who wants to set up a fight with old boxing rules between the two.  The fight is a highly anticipated fight by the convicts, since Chambers has made a large number of enemies within the prison.  Undisputed is a combination between a boxing film and a prison film that is rather predictable.

Had I gone to see this film in theatres I would've been disappointed immensely.  The plot was so dumb.  If Columbo could get Ving Rhames out of prison, why couldn't he get Wesley out, better yet why couldn't he get himself out???  How dumb is that?  This should have been a tv movie at best, never hit the big screen.  Rhames and Snipes are two decent actors, too bad they weren't allowed to show any acting abilities from this poorly written script.",1053820800,,623,4.310344827586207
1786159,4,B00006LPKA,"This film is very straightforward.  The scene is a prison, which has regular boxing matches between the inmates.  Wesley Snipes, who is serving a life sentence, is the undisputed champion.  And then Ving Rhames, the real world champion, is accused of rape in a very similar scenario to that of Mike Tyson.  He's sentenced to the prison too.  Naturally there is conflict as the two men lock horns.
There are no surprises in this film as it builds to its inevitable climax, with Peter Falk cast as a Mafioso inmate who arranges a boxing match inside the prison walls.  The acting is uniformly good.  And the script well written.  That's about the most to be expected from this kind of film.
Frankly, I rather liked it.  Maybe because it didn't try to be anything but what it was.  Therefore I give it a mild recommendation.",1051315200,,821,4.6

I did enjoy the fight towards the movie. Lets get to the story it's about a ten year undefeated champ who is in prison for being conviceted of murder(SNIPES)and a boxer in for a rape charge(RHAMES). It's a good thing I only rented this. This just should teach to rent before you buy a movie if you have not seen it in a theater or just watch the movie on TV. Im not saying don't see the movie if you want to than do so. Just rent it before you buy it. I'm Out. PEACE!",1045353600,,644,3.953846153846154

But the movie tries to place some diversions to make you think ""oh no, the warden is mad, now the fight isn't going to take place."" Give me a break. Not to mention during the character definitions, you already know who is going to win the fight before the movie is even into the first 20 minutes. If you still feel to so compelled to watch it, I would recommend skipping the whole story (because there really is no story) and go straight to the fight. At least you can recover an hour of wasted life.",1044144000,,647,4.184
1786162,1,B00006LPKA,"When I first saw the previews for this movie I have to admit I was pretty excited.  It looked like a potential action blockbuster with two pretty decent actors in Wesley and Ving playing opposite each other.  I really, really wanted to like it.
Guess I can't get everything I want.
Ving is the World Champion boxer imprisoned for raping a woman.  In the prison we find that there is an underground boxing world run by the guards and an old mobster.  The champion in this world is Wesley.  Naturally the movie builds to the final conflict between the two.
The movie was, at best, bad.  I kept watching hoping to see something emerge from this mess and it didn't.  The plot, or what little there was, was pure cliche and a bad one at that.  Neither actor really invested anything in the characters, both of which were also pure cliche.  Ving's was arrogant and over the top.  Wesley's was a Zen warrior.
Don't waste your time with this one.  If you want to see a ""bad"" boxing movie then Play it to the Bone with Antonio and Woody is much more entertaining.",1042070400,,1054,4.409326424870466
1786163,3,B00006LPKA,"I don't know what movies some of these critics have watched, but the final fight scene was left wanting.  What kinds of World Heavyweight champions and undefeated prison champions don't know how to play defense?  Now granted a real boxing fight between two greats may be a bit long and boring or last all of 30 seconds.  I just didn't think the fight was all that great.
  As for the movie, great story idea, but seemed like there should have been more to it.  I believe Snipes' character was meant to look like the silent bad-a$$ loner, but he came across as a weirdo.  I found myself cheering for the ""Iceman"" from the get go.  Plus, I'm pretty sure that if he weren't a paper champion (which he wasn't portrayed as) he would have produced a shellacking on Monroe inside of the first couple of minutes.  I actually liked the film for a testosterone-filled action flic, but the ending just didn't grab me and make me cheer for the tooth-pick architect.
  I recommend this as a rental maybe once, but it's definitley not a classic.",1041206400,,1031,4.518918918918919
1786164,3,B00006LPKA,"Good filmmaking requires a satisfying total package. This movie only delivers in certain aspects. It has good acting, but a bad script. Good choreography but little character development. Good sound effects, but bad sound track. And so very predictable. I kept expecting that the director would throw some kind of twist in there somewhere, but it never came.
And there's another problem. You really don't feel for any of these characters. You couldn't care less what happens to any of them. Rhames' character steals the show, but never really gets the audience to hate him(a villain's job) because whether or not he committed a crime is questionable and his only other fault seems to be a big ego. Snipes'(supposedly the movie's hero) is seen even less than Rhames and even less sympathy is built for him because it is obvious that he did commit murder and all he ever does is sit around by himself in silence. This is what you call 0 character development. If the filmmakers were trying to build a Rocky-like charisma and audience appeal for the guy, they failed miserably. The end result is a boxing match that is cool, but the excitement just isn't there because you don't really care who wins.
I know this film isn't trying to be Rocky, but it certainly pales in comparison. This film is forgettable at best.",1040601600,,1312,4.758771929824562
1786165,5,B00006LPKA,I am a big fan of Ving Rhames and Wesley Snipes.  I really think they both did a wonderful job in this movie.  Ving Rhames is a powerful actor in every role and he did not miss a step in this movie.  I like the way Wesley Snipes was a strong not loud character.  The movie did not make you feel sorry for the two of them.  It is just a story about two very different strong men who enter into a fight to get what they both want.  It was a great movie that everyone should have went to see.  The ending was great.,1038873600,,512,3.8190476190476192
1786166,3,B00006LPKA,"Not great, but entertaining enough that you don't get bored.  Ving Rhames shows why he's one of the top actors in the business.  Peter Falk's performance was truly good as it was hilarious as an aging mobster.  Great scratchy voice gave him that old mobster/mafia feel.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to see much of Wesley Snipes.  I thought Walter Hill could have gotten more into why Snipes' character was incarcerated for murder from the start instead of the thirty second snippet of him beating a man up for apparently sleeping with his wife/girlfriend.  We all knew why ""Iceman"" (Ving Rhames) was in prison from the start, from the middle, and from the end.  Since I'm a boxing enthusiast, I was left with the question of whether or not an actual heavyweight or middleweight champ in the prison circuit could actually beat a known champion on the outside?  Ving Rhames and Peter Falk were entertaining enough that an otherwise boring cliched film turned out to be worth watching.  I've wasted my money on far worse with worse acting.  So I give this Three stars.",1038787200,,1066,4.775956284153006

I enjoyed UNDISPUTED for the first thirty minutes or so but after that I became lost. I was looking for deeper character development than I ever got. We get to know Ving Rhames character the most (mainly because he's a replica of Mike Tyson) and he's the antagonist. We get introduced to several supporting characters (Wes Studi, Fisher Stevens, Peter Falk, Michael Rooker, Jon Seda) here and there for whatever reason. However, they're all a prison clich.
The character we never get to know, oddly, is the hero, played by Wesley Snipes. We can only assume that Snipes is the hero because of his sensitive hobby of making houses out of toothpicks. Other than that, Snipes has only about twenty lines. It's weird. Rhames even though billed second has far more screen time than Snipes.
I can't help but feel that this film lost it in the editing room. Somehow this movie feels like half a movie. Like important parts have been chopped away. I just can't imagine writers Walter Hill and David Giler (ALIEN), or any writers for that matter, writing a script with such a non-dimensional lead character.
While action film veteran Walter Hill (48 HOURS; LAST MAN STANDING) has learned some stylish new tricks to filmmaking, they're not enough to save his latest effort. All in all, two incarcerated boxers go head to head, but it's the movie that gets K.O.'d.
D+ (the plus is for Ving Rhames)",1038355200,,1615,4.771428571428571
1786178,4,B00006LPKA,"Even though it is a rip off of Mike Tyson, except this guy actually gets in a boxing match in prison, it's not bad. It reminds me of Digstown with out the humor. It's a fun movie, but if you psychoanalize it enough you can see plenty of problems with it.
In my opinon: Kick back, relax, and be entertained. It will never be as bad as ID4 and the IMAC, or Signs and the aliens who come to a planet that is 75% water and they are alergic to water.
  This is fantastic boxing film.  Wesley Snipes doesn't play the character he normaly plays.  Yes, he plays an action hero, but for the first time in a movie...he is fairly quite and soft spoken.  The best thing about this movie, is that it builds up the anticipation of the big fight at the end.  It doesn't just show a story then thow an ending at you.

7971986,4,B00006LPKA,"Director Walter Hill (Bullet to the Head, Last Man Standing, Red Heat, The Warriors) brings us the kind of organized prison competition that clearly influenced the style and pattern of Death Race (2008; based on 1975s Death Race 2000). But where this differs from its sequels and other influenced successors is that this is no action flick. This is actually a pretty solid movie that doesnt need to rely on its action.

Charged for a crime he denies committing, heavyweight boxing champ (46-1-0) George The Iceman Chambers (Ving Rhames; Piranha 3D, the Mission: Impossible series) finds himself in the very same prison as another purported 68-0 undefeated champ of the California State Inter-Prison Boxing Program.  Naturally, he questions the validity of any such claims in boxing greatness. Theres only one champ in here!

We first meet Munroe Hutchin (Wesley Snipes; The Expendables 3, Blade 1-3, Rising Sun) dismantling a much larger opponent (Nils Allen Stewart; Bloodsport 2, The Quest, Barb Wire) while showing off his jacked body and surgically vicious technique.  Hes the Icemans opposite in every way, in and out of the ring.

The venerable, imprisoned mob boss Mendy (Peter Falk; Next, The Princess Bride), his right-hand man Chuy (Jon Seda; Bad Boys II, Bullet to the Head) and Hutchins corner man Ratbag (Fisher Stevens; Hackers, Awake) plant the seeds of competition, taunting the Iceman and questioning his skill.  Meanwhile, Icemans cellmate Mingo (Wes Studi; The Last of the Mohicans, Penny Dreadful) and manager Yank (Dayton Callie; Sons of Anarchy, Halloween II) try to steer him from trouble during his sentence.  They set up a high stakes fight between the two champs.

Unlike subsequent movies in which the wealthy warden runs the show (often through criminal means), the head prison guard Mercker (Michael Rooker; Guardians of the Galaxy Vols. 1-2, The Belko Experiment, The Walking Dead) coordinates and serves as the official for the fight.

This movie makes every effort (and often successfully) to be substantial. So it should come as no surprise that the boxing/fighting scenes are not numerous. But when we get them, they're good!  Not outstanding (like Rocky IV), but they bask in the excitement of seeing two well-known chiseled actors in the ring instead of an A-list hero and some no-name-actor foe.

Two things kept this movie from being great. For one thing, the training scenes were weak. Wheres my training montage? Secondly, the championship bout had no scoring. When Rocky fought Ivan Drago (Rocky IV) the action choreography was great, brutal, and well-staged to cue up emotionbut what truly catalyzed the experience was War playing in the background.",1502064000,,2691,5.17741935483871
