8430499,2,B000IB0KGK,"This DVD was a disappointment to me.  The instructor skips over the important parts how these various artists create melodic rock solos and wastes a bunch of time on playing solos ""in the style of,"" then goes into a ""put this finger on this fret, then put that finger on that fret, then put this finger on that fret"" kind of instruction on how to play the solos he just played for you.  While mildly interesting, it doesn't go too far in getting across to you WHY he (and the artists he's emulating) put their fingers on the abovementioned frets.

If you apply yourself, you'll learn to play the solos he shows you, which sound vaguely like Gary Moore, David Gilmour and Steve Lukather solos, but good luck creating your own Moore-, Gilmour- and Lukather-like solos.  Or your own solos, period.  And isn't that why we study these people and their approaches to guitar playing?  To improve our own phrasing, note choice, etc.?",1208822400,7,925,4.644171779141105
