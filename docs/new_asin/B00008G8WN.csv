1844564,3,B00008G8WN,"Three heads in a fountain, each one seeking happiness, thrown in by three hopeful lovers, which one will the fountain bless...actually the original song specifies coins rather than heads, but I think both work just as well...The Head (1959) aka A Head for the Devil aka Die Nackte und der Satan aka The Screaming Head, written and directed by Victor Trivas, stars prolific German actor Horst Frank (The Vengeance of Fu Manchu) and Karin Kernke (Schoolgirl Report Part 12: Young Girls Need Love) in a sinister tale of disembodied heads, murder, with a dash of kink.

As the film begins, we notice a strange character, we later find out his name is Dr. Ood (Frank), lurking outside the laboratory/bachelor pad of Prof. Dr. Abel (I'm serious, that's what it says on the sign outside...it seems kind of unusual to use both titles, but I guess if you've managed to amass the credentials, why not use them?).  Turns out he's looking for a job, and he seems to know something of Dr. Abel, specifically his experiments with keeping body parts alive well after the host has passed, by using his own specially developed `Z' serum.  Ood manages to worm his way into Dr. Abel's employment (I would have done a background check myself, but hey, that's just me), and soon finds himself performing a heart transplant on Abel as he has a bum ticker, and, as luck would have it, a vagrant has just suffered terminal injuries (oh happy day!), and Abel has managed to acquire the man, and his still functioning heart, for himself.  Anyway, the bum croaks before the transplant takes place, so Ood decides the only thing to do is remove Abel's head and keep it alive, which he does, as he wants whatever secrets Abel possesses.  Abel comes to, and once he realizes his new position, that of a head resting on a counter living off machines, he starts to realize what a monster Ood really is (I bet he was wishing he did that background check now...), but wait, Ood has more plans...after dispatching a troublesome associate, Ood performs another operation, transplanting the head of a local hunchbacked nurse (she'd been in contact with Dr. Abel and his associate hoping for some sort of operation to make her `normal' again), played by Kernke, onto the body of a local striptease dancer (next time you're in the Tam Tam Club, don't bother asking for Lily, as she no work there anymore).  The nurse, unaware of Ood's actual plans, awakens, and Ood feeds her a story about how he `grew' a new body for her, but she soon learns otherwise as various facts begin to emerge.  She tries to escape Ood's clutches (he seems interested in her more than just as a patient), but Ood feels she owes him, and isn't too eager to let her just walk away.

I did enjoy this movie a lot, as my original impression was that of a funky B film, so I wasn't expecting a lot.  The direction is pretty stylistic of what I would loosely describe dark and brooding, accompanied by well designed and put together sets, especially those of the complex and sophisticated laboratory (Abel's disembodied head set up looks entirely realistic).  The use of light and dark shadows lends a real atmospheric tone that reminds me of the Universal monster films of the 30's.  Also, the music, the spooky stuff, at least, enhanced the film greatly with its' sinister, ethereal quality.  Now for the bad...there seemed to be some real odd transitioning between some of the scenes, unnecessary fades, sharp, harsh cuts and such, that tend cause a number of scenes to just not fit together as well as they're supposed to...the result is a jarring effect that took me out of the story, as now I was trying to figure out how two adjacent scenes were supposed to fit together.  Also, since this was a German production, the film has been dubbed into English.  The dialog used in the dubbing can be pretty awkward, and while it may be `grammatically' correct, it lacks the even flow of what most of us are used to with regards to normal conversation.  It's like the German script was translated word for word into English, and then used `as is', without any of the necessary refinements one would have to make accounting for variances in structure between two languages.  I will admit it was kinda funny at times, especially when a character would make an obtuse declaration for no real apparent reason.  The actors seemed to perform well, but given the dubbing, it's hard to say for sure.  Frank presented a really interesting character, sort of wild-eyed and creepy, and made for a great, classic mad scientist.  One part that seemed funny to me was when he transplanted the hunchback nurse's head onto the stripper's body, he must have also installed some breast implants, as the rack on the stripper's body (now with the nurse's head) was greatly increased.

The full screen picture (I'm pretty sure this is the original aspect ratio here) on this DVD released by Alpha Video looks very poor.  Alpha Video seems to specialize in acquiring movies and such that have lapsed into the public domain (movies where the original copyright has expired and now anyone can release it...the Capra film It's a Wonderful Life is probably the most famous example, and that's why it always seems to be playing on some channel during the holidays, as it doesn't cost anything to show), so, subsequently, the source print is riddled with lines, white speckling, and other various forms of age deterioration.  Most of the money for this release seems to have been put into the cover art for the DVD box, which seems to be standard practice for Alpha...no special features here, just a decent movie with inherent flaws, transferred to DVD from extremely poor source material, and offered at a very low price.

1844565,4,B00008G8WN,"Wow! If you're a fan of classic Universal Studios-type atmosphere, look no further than ""The Head"". Pure unadulterated drive-in fare, ""The Head"" brings back fond memories of the 60's, when TV horror hosts like Sir Graves Ghastly and others would screen lesser-known gems like this one on Saturday afternoons.
Alpha Video is to be commended for making stuff like this available for a reasonable price; if any criticism could be levelled at them, it's that the print was not particularly good, and it shows in the transfer.  Still, the film itself will make you forget all about that..it's really good! The actor who portrays Dr. Ood is especially memorable, like Peter Lorre without all the mannerisms.

1844566,3,B00008G8WN,"It's a very good movie, but what irritated me during its vewing was that the director had ""forgoten"" to mention in the credits that he'd made an adaptation from a book by one of the greatest Soviet SF-writers - Alexander Belyaiev. The book's title is ""The head of professor Dawell"". It was first published in 1925 as a short story and lated was rewritten in a novel.
The adaptation is a very close one, even such details as the birthmark on the girl's shoulder were taken from the book. Maybe the motives of characters are somewhat changed, but that doesn't excuse the director, who, being of Russian origin, obviously had read the book.",1073952000,4,637,4.646017699115045

1844568,4,B00008G8WN,"This is the best severed head film you're ever gonna see!  I had first heard about this film in Cahill and Toombs' ""Immoral Tales"" as an exemplar of low budget German exploitation... and now that I have seen it I keep thinking ""why haven't more people been after this?""  It works artistically on the same kind of level as ""Eyes Without a Face"" but with a bit more, well, concreteness and less poetry.  It tells the story of Dr. Ood who joins with a group of scientists and dispatches them one by one so he can further their experiments in keeping heads alive but with his own amoral vigour.  A hunchbaked woman enters in and has her head put on a murdering stripper's body, and the film keeps it in a grey area about how much the hunchback might know about her surgery beforehand while still making her a believable heroine. In the meanwhile Dr. Ood loses it every time he sees a full moon (in a weird note, his triangularly bushy eyebrows seem to naturally fit in with the set... trust me on this.)  And last but not least, the real star of the film, Herbert Warm, who with Bruno Monden, created sets for this film, and made it the last Great German Expressionist Film.  He had worked on ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and you can tell here in the way that all walkways turn angles and lead upwards and all the shadows are constructed in a thin and chiascuro kind of way that go vertically.  And that living room and staircase with the Michealangelo... picture Dr. Caligari having a swinging luxury bachelor pad and you get the idea (and it works).

1844659,4,B00008G8WN,"This 4-star ranking is, of course, targeted at people who enjoy campy classic horror flicks as I do myself.

The story: A skilled scientist/doctor has developed a miraculous serum which helps him to facilitate transplants of human organs. Okay, we do that now so that was more than plausible.

But then as a result of an emergency, this same scientist requires an immediate heart transplant. He has two physician assistants, one evil and one ethical. The evil one decides to go for it but due to a problem, he can only keep this scientist's *head* alive. Of course it sits in a pan with all manner of tubes and wires attached but he can actually speak -- and he wants to die.

Meanwhile, the evil doctor moves onward with his research with the prospect of grafting a pretty girl's head (she's a nurse at the lab and a major hunchback so her motive is to simply eliminate *that* problem) on to a curvy stripper's body. And that's where things really get wild.

This is a great old German black-and-white treasure (it's all rendered in English) and it compares nicely with a film which sports a very similar theme:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brain-That-Wouldn-t-Die/dp/B00006SFIT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brain That Wouldn't Die</a>.

1844661,1,B00008G8WN,"It should be noted in advance, that this film is fairly well-respected in Europe, as something of an impressionist masterpiece. They take it seriously and the director has a reputation for being a genius, compared to the likes of F.W. Mernau. They used to show it late at night on WWOR channel 9 in NY in the mid-sixties. At least they did the one time.

It scared people so badly, it was never shown again.

I was also a box office hit, my brother saw it in the movies, and the film with Jason Evers, ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" was initially called, ""The Head That Wouldn't Die"" (if you wait until the end credits, you can still see the old title right when they finish).

So, this is not trash.

I bought a copy on VHS about a year and a half ago because I'd never seen it, had only heard about it.

It was an expensive copy, struck from an original print. Unfortunately, my VCR wasn't up to the challenge.

So I bought this.

I figured, ""DVD, much better copy, great clarity,"" whatnot. This has been struck from a really lousy print. It's dark, grainy, looks like I'm viewing it through an aquarium. It has jumpy cuts from a bad projector experience and the sound is poor.

Save your money.

1844664,4,B00008G8WN,"Sure, those Mill Creek ""Classics"" packages contain pictures so awful that even a man of questionable taste, such as myself, would scant be caught watching them. And yet, tucked between the ""Galaxy Invaders"" and ""Kong Islands"" are some decent foreign and b-grade movies one might never see otherwise. Case in point: ""The Head"", an East German flick of late-50s vintage, where we find the dementedly creepy Dr. Oud performing some ghastly experiments that go beyond mere science fiction fodder. Oud takes over the laboratory of Dr. Abel, a medical researcher who has stumbled upon a formula by which, combined with some mechanical apparatus, the severed head of a dog is kept alive artificially. Poor Dr. Abel unfortunately becomes the first human subject, and spends the film as a talking head plopped upon what appears to be a fish tank. Dr. Oud also amuses himself by swapping the head of a hunchbacked girl onto the body of a stripper. Of course, the police eventually catch on to the nefarity and Oud gets his Hari Kari on. Fantastical, right? Well, get this. Just a few short years after ""The Head"" was released, Dr. Robert White proved such things could be done, first reviving the disembodied brain of a dog, and later successfully grafting the head of a monkey onto the body of another. Even today, Dr. White dreams of performing a human head transplant before he dies. Sleep well, my friend...",1155513600,3,1401,4.866108786610878

1844666,5,B00008G8WN,"Well folks, this is certainly a must see. This is not your typical campy 1950's Sci-Fi/Horror. It's very gothic and dark. Not terrifying, but more hypnotizing. Even the slow parts have a surrealism that you can't turn away from.

Dr. Ood should have gone down as one of the great cinema mad scientists. His perfectly triangular eyebrows just add to his sinister demure. His mission in life it seems is to become a great scientist, but needs to follow in the footsteps of another who has surpassed his own results. He ultimatly decapitates the greater scientist, but keeps his head alive to learn his many secrets. One of them is to save a beautiful woman from disfigurement. She is a nurse who was an assistant to the professor's assistant (did you follow that?)

Well the woman is a looker to begin with, but when she receives the body of a stripper, whew! Lock up the sailors indeed. But he is insanely jealous of her. He doesn't see her as a person, but as his property, his creation. She runs and seeks help from the stripper's former lover of all people. He is an artist, and for all his trouble he gets his house set on fire and is arrested. But in the end I'm sure he hooked up with the beautiful nurse.

And what of Dr. Oog? Well aside from being a mad scientist, he's also quite the firebug. He sets two fires in this film. The second one was to destroy the evidence of the living head. But the cops are chasing him through the building and poor Dr. Oog leaps to his death in an Oscar worthy performance.

If your looking for another campy ""Brain that Wouldn't Die"" clone, this is not it. A serious movie of this genre from the 50's is a rare treat indeed.",1125360000,,1665,4.378640776699029
1844667,5,B00008G8WN,"This film is dark. In atmosphere, it is totally unlike The Brain That Wouldn't Die, which takes a similar situation and handles it so ineptly it becomes a classic of low comedy. The female head in the dish in that film rallys no empathy to her cause. We can watch The Brain with (pun intended) total detachment.

The Head is different. I knew the film by film stills and scraps of detail about its reputation alone. Still, nothing prepared me for the ugliness and desperation of the nominal character's situation. In THIS head film, you feel trapped. There's no fooling around. The head is bullied, emotionally blackmailed and threatened, and this time, the head actually cares what happens to himself. You sense that he clings to a hope for a return to some kind of life. You never get this from The Brain, where the nominal character goes over the top to cackling maniac shortly after she susses her situation. The head here is an aging man who seems fatigued and depressed and finally just wants his hopeless reality to be repaired (which he realizes is unlikely to happen) or to just go away.

What all this means is that The Head isn't a guiltless C-movie fun romp, like The Brain That Wouldn't Die. You may not take The Head any more seriously than you do The Brain, but I predict you won't be able to laugh it off as easily as Grade C hokum. The science of the Head may be a crock, but the horror of the basic situation hits a nerve. It will stay with you.",1114732800,7,1463,4.434944237918216

He needs a new heart straight away.  To that end, he requires a couple of assistants to do the operation.  He enlists the help of the very strange Dr. Ood (Horst Frank).  Unfortunately, Ood quarrels with the second doctor on call, Dr. Walter Burke, on the best way to proceed.  Not one to take kindly to dissent, Dr. Ood murders Dr. Burke and buries him in a forest, telling everyone he left town.  As a result, poor Dr. Abel loses a body to science; his head plopped on a table like a trophy.  Dr. Ood keeps him around as a conversation piece.  He wants the good doctor to spill his guts on his super-secret Serum Z.  Dr. Abel refuses, saying the ingredients are all in his head.  With time on his hands, Dr. Ood decides to perform another operation.  This one requires a head switch.  He just happens to know a stripper named Lilly (but she used to be Stella).  She knows too much but has a fabulous body so he takes it and gives it to Irene (Karin Kernke), expecting her to be grateful enough to fall in love with him.  She thinks not and all hell breaks loose as the bad doctor has a complete meltdown.

I thought this film was fabulous.  Beyond bizarre, its  nutty premise is wacky enough to be highly entertaining.  Horst Frank as Dr. Ood is fascinating to watch as he methodically goes from merely strange to blithefully homicidal.  And that head, chatting up a storm, what's not to love?
