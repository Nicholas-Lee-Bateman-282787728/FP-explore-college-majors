8699104,5,B00SS0U69O,"This is a DVD with great instructions for bellydancers of all levels, or even for other types of dancers.
The section about posture explains everything beginners should know, and intermediate dancers can also review the basics.
I also really like the warm-up section.
The warm-ups use every body part, so they work great for any kind of dance, not only for bellydance.
The DVD covers basic movements for each body part (arms, shoulders, hips, chest...), so beginners can follow the later section on combinations.
Even intermediates will be able to improve upon making each movement more smooth and graceful.
The main part of this DVD includes 10 fun and stunning combinations and her signature movement section.
All of them are beautiful and would help with making your own choreography.
Also, all these combinations are perfect for daily practices for all levels of dancers.
This DVD includes 3 magnificent performances by Tempest with beautiful music by Nathaniel Johnstone.
Her style is always different and artistic, so these performances would provide brilliant inspirations for all levels and genres of dancers or performers.
DVD comes with a special audio CD, including beautiful music by Nathaniel Johnstone.
This CD covers all songs used in this DVD.
I am sure she is already planning her next issue of DVD, and I would love it if the DVD includes a section on floor works.
I previously took her workshop on floor works, and it was amazing!",1428019200,2,1449,5.041666666666667
8699105,5,B00SS0U69O,"I enjoy the rythym of how it is organized.  It feels really good when I do all the isolated warm-up movements, working different muscles I don't use enough. This is a challenging DVD and I like the interesting combinations (carefully introduced beforehand).  Tempest's kind voice prods me to keep going a little longer when I feel like stopping!  I bought this as a gift for myself and am ready for another of her DVD's...",1427241600,2,422,4.675675675675675
