8125884,5,B000FS1HAE,"This is another of Dev Anand""s own creation of a masterpiece. Story of the  family  together and separations marred by rough times. How our own decisions shape our future and destiny.. Dev's philosophy is to be guided by the sound morals as when derailed there is a price to be paid to fix all the ills. Video was full of disturbance but not the audio that provides excellent music by R D Burman like his counterpart S D Burman. Melodies are sung by the gifted voices of Lata and Kishore mainly. Dev has been artistic and visionary to also find the best to play their part for the over all success of this movie. Dev has been known for a number of movies of excellence like CID, Patita and Taxi Driver to name few along with Nau Do Gyarah as he never settled for less.",1457481600,,768,4.289655172413793
8125885,3,B000FS1HAE,The movie arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  This movie has a few beautiful stars from India and some really meaningful song lyrics showing a true respect for Indian religious beliefs.  There seems to be some historical truth depicted in the movie also.  There was truly an influence in India when the hippies from the late 1960's and early 1970's converged on India and the ISKON movement of Srila Prabupada started to become well known in India.  I liked this movie very much.,1326499200,,482,4.771084337349397
8125886,3,B000FS1HAE,"In the background of the rise of the International Hare Krishna movement in the 1970s, is a Montreal-based family of the Jaiswals, consisting of mom, dad, son, Prashant, and daughter, Jasbir. Due to irreconciable differences between Mr and Mrs Jaiswal, they separate, leaving Jasbir with dad, and Prashant with his mom.
Prashant has grown up to be a pilot. He has received a letter from his dad that Jasbir, who had rebelled and left home, is now located in Kathmandu, Nepal, with a group of hippies. Prashant undertakes to find his sister and hopefully get her back to the family.",1301875200,,581,4.82
8125887,4,B000FS1HAE,"In many ways this is a very dated movie, but like many films from the late sixties and early seventies, it is also a testament to a time that has passed and gone.  Dev Annand has scripted and directed a well-conceived if somewhat predictable and traditional (in its morals) look at the ""hippie"" scene in Kathmandu circa 1970.  Zeenat plays his sister, split by divorce when they were younger, and they have grown up separately (one in Montreal, other in India).  He tracks her down in the glory days of Freak Street in Kathmandu, though Zeenat and her crew hang out more around the monkey temple at Swayambuth, a little bit outside the city, though there are great shots of Kathmandu 35 years ago - looks a lot simpler, less congested and less pollution.  For those who know the city, its a real treat to see it so long ago.

The performances are all very good, the plot a little contrived.  But its the 60s styles in the film, the soundtrack, all make this film much more watchable and memorable than many of its counterparts, Indian or otherise of the era.  Its not Antonioni, but that isn't all bad either....",1201564800,3,1112,4.53
