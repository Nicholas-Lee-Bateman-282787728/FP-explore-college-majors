It's only about 30 mins long but the introduction ""hello"" song is almost five minutes and they sing again towards the end of the video ""goodbye"" song which is another few minutes so basically you are left with like 20 minutes of video... waste money i think! The singing hello/goodbye song is all the same they just change the name for each kid! Lame!!! I bought 6 different dvd of these bounce dvd and they all have that introduction and farewell song! I wouldnt buy them again. My kids hate watching it! Save your money and buy other videos instead!!!!",1486684800,,646,4.436974789915967

8195177,5,B000Q7ZL1K,"Excellent DVD. However, beware of sellers who have European (REGION 2 ) DVDs for sale which will not play on most USA players. Look for Region ONE DVDs.",1439078400,,152,4.464285714285714
8195178,4,B000Q7ZL1K,Great videos but these prices are outrageous!  Buy at Spectrum Connections!  My children both have autism and love these videos and I highly recommended them.  Go to the official site!,1281052800,,184,5.066666666666666
8195179,1,B000Q7ZL1K,"$30 for a 25 minute DVD is highway robbery! AUTISM SHOULD NOT = CA-CHING! But because nobody complains loud enough about this injustice they just keep on marking things up.  It's really shameful. I'm not buying this at this price, no way.",1274918400,,238,4.666666666666667
8195180,5,B000Q7ZL1K,this is a wonderful dvd that engages children with autism - my 5 yr old client responded immediatley to the lessons in this dvd as well as the other bounce dvds his parents have for him.,1233187200,,186,4.194444444444445
8195181,5,B000Q7ZL1K,Nothing to add - an outstanding product. Elizabeth is charming and the songs are terrific for both young kids AND adults,1230508800,2,120,4.761904761904762
8195182,5,B000Q7ZL1K,"My child is not even on the spectrum, but the Bounce DVDs are a huge hit in our house.  Elizabeth's songs are fantastic -- they don't drive you nuts like other kid-tunes.  And the themes of all the DVDs teach coping skills and behaviors that can benefit ALL children.  It is so nice to see a DVD like this that actually uses REAL kids rather than wall-to-wall cartoons and none of that strange, psychedelic animation that seems to be the trend.  If your child is a late talker, or just shy, or just likes great music to jump around to, then the Bounce DVDs are the best that money can buy.  How many ways can I praise this series?  Can I give it more stars than five?  And when on earth are they going to add more episodes??  Kids and parents are waiting...",1222387200,,757,4.244755244755245
