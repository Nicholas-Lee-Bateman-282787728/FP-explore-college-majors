533382,2,630300413X,"For people who are just begining to discover Argento, if you have not seen this, don't. I suggest for you to start with SUSPIRIA or DEEP RED, his masterpieces. Altough i am a fan i have to say that this is probably one of Argento's worst, next to FOUR FLIES ON GRAY VELVET and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. He holds back considerably on the gore, probably to please the american production company he was working for. In his European productions he does not hold back. Even though in the past he has compensated for a weak narrative by including incredible style and scares this film has neither. It does not feel or look like Argento and the narative is ridiculous. His daughter Asia Argento does a competent enough job and so does Christopher Rydell but the rest of the cast is over the top. And all the hard work that Tom Savini put into the special effects is missing here. It has been cut for this version. And while Argento films are usually accompanied by a great music score the music here sounds like something out of a bad B-horror movie. In short, Argento was not able to put to good use the things that has made his films so good: style, scares, gore, and good music. Do yourself a favor and try to avoid this dreck until you have seen some of Argetno's better work.",987033600,4,1274,4.379746835443038
533383,3,630300413X,"This was the only movie directed by Dario Argento that my local Blockbuster carried, and even though it was in a censored R-rated cut, I must say I liked it.  At its best, ""Trauma"" invoked late-70's/early-80's John Carpenter, and was easily one of the scarier films I'd seen in a while.  However, the acting (by a predominately American cast including Frederic Forrest, Piper Laurie, and Brad Dourif) was mostly over-the-top and horrible.  And now, after seeing such Argento masterpieces as ""Deep Red,"" ""Suspiria,"" and ""Tenebrae,"" ""Trauma"" really pales in comparison but is still good.  It might be more easily accessible to someone who hasn't been exposed to Argento before, but for hardcore fans it's only a lukewarm offering.",983318400,2,728,5.1440677966101696
533384,3,630300413X,"This movie is firstly about a love story between a suicidal, anorexic girl and the guy who saves his life. Without going into details, let's say that their relationship develops as a serial killer called ""Head Hunter"" terrorizes the city and the girl is drawn into the events surrounding the murders. The atmosphere of the movie is pretty spooky even though the narrative and the story telling is cut abruptly from time to time. The murder scenes are pretty scary and there is some high tension suspense and a few twists as well. Look for the scene with the ""elevator"" and the kid from the house next door. Asia Argento was good in her role however I cannot say the same thing about Christopher Rydell. Not that he is an awful actor, I just did not think he was the right person to cast for the role. The suspense and the scare make up for the lack of cohesiveness of the story",981331200,,877,4.419753086419753
533385,3,630300413X,"This was my first experience with Dario Agento and ""Trauma"" was  alright. Nothing more and nothing less, I could have wasted my money in  renting much worse movies, but it would have been no loss if I rented  ""Reservoir Dogs"" for the third time instead of this. No doubt,  there are some ultra-creepy scenes that were memorable. But overall, this  movie had it's lenghts and doesn't manage to keep the suspense. After 90  minutes were over I had lost any interest in the discovery of the  ""true"" killer. My biggest problem is that the movie relies too  much on the twisted conclusion. About half the movie you want to throw  something really heavy on Dario's Head because it seems so pretty obvious  who the killer is and his two heros are busy in doing things the viewer  doesn't always understand ( Example : There are nearly twenty keys on the  dead Nurse's ring, who tells them which of them will take them on the  killer's feet? ). It would have also been kind if cut-off heads would  simply keep their mouths shut, it would be a lot more believeable. (I know  that this is a horror-film, but even horror-films should be believeable in  some kind of way, or else they fail to grip). On the other Hand, there are  of course a lot of good things that make the movie worth watching. The  creepy atmosphere of the whole movie, even the falling rain looks scary!  The ending is really frightening and made my stomach twist a little.  Suspense is also in it, enough to keep you from switching off but not  enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Maybe my expectations were a  little too high, I will try to see ""Susperia"" soon. After all -  worth renting, but I wouldn't say it was a real highlight.",968544000,,1703,4.422580645161291
533459,3,630300413X,"Dario Argento movies are kinda stupid, but stupid in an interesting way.

Sounds weird, but it works: the general clunkiness adds to the air of mystery.  Asia Argento hasn't quite got the charisma to carry her part, but it's still interesting to see her when she was very young.  (Though there's a brief gratuitous topless scene during which it's impossible to think of anything other than her father standing behind the camera.) Piper Laurie is, as always, a hoot.  But who cares, right?  The decapitations are the star of this movie, and they're well done.  Plus the final operating room twist is impressively grotesque.",1240963200,2,924,5.557142857142857
533460,3,630300413X,"Like most Dario Argento films, TRAUMA revolves around a Giallo-style killer. In this particular film, the killer decapitates people and keeps their heads as trophies. In TRAUMA, the acting powerhouse Asia Argento (star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XXX/dp/B0007Q6VXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XXX</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MOTHER-OF-TEARS/dp/B001AR0D6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MOTHER OF TEARS</a>&nbsp;and daughter of the film's director) stars as Aura, an attention-seeking teenager with an eating disorder. She meets a man named David, and shortly thereafter Aura's parents fall victim to the serial killer who the media calls the ""Headhunter"". The rest of the film revolves around Aura and David trying to find out the identity of the killer as well as the method to his (or her) mayhem.

I haven't seen all of director Dario Argento's films yet so it would be unfair to call this film his ""sloppiest"", but it still is a sloppy movie. Not only because it fails to capture the creepy atmosphere like his other films, but even as a standalone movie it's not very good. It's entertaining, but the overall product leaves much to be desired. You can see the Boom Operator's hand in one of the shots, the dialogue in the film is a bit ridiculous, and one of the green screen effects used in the film is horrible (it's the scene where a severed head is falling down an elevator shaft). Also the score doesn't really fit the movie and it sounds like music from HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS or some ridiculous kids movie. However, on the flip side there are some good things about TRAUMA. From a filmmaking point of view it's a bad film, but from an entertainment perspective I actually enjoyed TRAUMA a lot. The unknown, faceless killer storyline is always great because it keeps you interested and in most cases the killer's identity or motive isn't revealed until the end of the film, and TRAUMA is no different. In the movie, the killer only takes out a handful of people (usually Hospital employees) and only kills when it's raining. When everything is revealed, it gets pretty bizarre to say the least. As a matter of fact, the whole MOVIE is pretty bizarre. From Aura's eating disorder and unusual antics to David's obsession with Aura to the unusual twist at the end. And for some reason, every severed head in the film has the ability to talk for a few seconds after it's been removed from its body. The key to what made me enjoy this film is definitely Asia Argento's outstanding portrayal of Aura, which has to be seen to be believed.

So, overall I found TRAUMA to be entertaining, bizarre, and silly, yet sloppy at times. Since this is a pretty obscure movie I'm sure only three types of people will watch this movie: hardcore Dario Argento fans, casual Dario Argento fans who are looking to get to know the director's filmography, and Asia Argento fans. With that being said if you're a hardcore Dario fan you'll either love or hate this movie. You'll love it if you're one of the people who worships at the altar of Dario Argento and sees everything he does as golden, or you'll hate it because it fails to deliver the goods compared to his classic films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUSPIRIA/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUSPIRIA</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TENEBRE/dp/B0015D3YR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TENEBRE</a>. If you're a casual Dario Argento fan, I would recommend you skip this one. If you're an Asia Argento fan then you'll be in for a treat because not only do you get to witness her awesome acting ability, but she does get topless in a scene also. Hooray for boobies.

533461,4,630300413X,"I'm a huge Dario Argento fan, but like most of his fans, have been very disappointed by his post-1987 work, which ranges from mediocre to abysmal.  This film, finally available in its uncut form at 106 minutes (most VHS version ran around 86 minutes) and widescreen, is a lot better than almost all of Argento's work after 1987.  It isn't perfect, but it's very watchable and quite extraordinary at times.

This was Argento's first foray into American filmmaking, and while that could have been a recipe for disaster, it's not.  The film is extremely well shot, with some fantastic camera work (it wouldn't be an Argento film if it wasn't), a surprisingly good performance by Dario's daugher Asia (most of Dario's films have mediocre to bad acting), and a somewhat coherent plot.  It's also nice to see actors who aren't badly dubbed into English for once in his work.  All of the dialogue is in English here.  Christopher Rydell, the lead actor, is pretty good, and some of the supporting actors (especially Rydell's boss at the TV station) are surprisingly good.  Unfortunately, the dialogue isn't very good, the music score is very, very conventional, and James Russo's police detective has some scenes that just jump into the film without a moment's notice.  There are highly questionable character motivations, and the fact that Asia Argento's character is anoxeric really doesn't have any point other than she's anoxeric.  Dario doesn't really explore this plot point at all, other than a striking shot from a moving car that focuses on overly thin women.  But the revelation at the end of the film is quite shocking and strikingly shot, and it does pack quite a jolt.  There are some intense scenes, especially when a boy from the neighborhood is spying on a person who might be the killer.  There's not much gore here, and Tom Savini's effects don't really stand out like they do on other films.  The only really memorable gore scene is when a woman's head is sawed off, and the head still manages to talk to Rydell.  There's also a scene in an asylum that's really surreal and memorable.

If you are a Dario Argento film, you should really watch this.  There's a lot in it to enjoy, especially since this DVD is the uncut version.  Dario has always had problems with distributors in this country on almost every movie he's made, and it hasn't been gore that's the problem.  They always leave all the gore in; they just hack up the plot, making the films even more incoherent.  Make sure you check this one out.  It's one of Argento's most underrated, and the best film from his later period (even though I haven't seen everything from that period).",1227139200,,2657,4.75764192139738
533462,3,630300413X,"Dario Argento directed ""Trauma"" as well as the masterpiece ""Deep Red,"" one of the most superior Italian gialli ever made.  The most gruesome scene in ""Deep Red"" is the slow decapitation death of the serial killer when a chain is slowly pulled through his/her neck.  This scene is repeated many times in ""Trauma"" when the black-gloved killer, known in the newspapers as ""The Headhunter,"" leisurely decapitates his/her victims with mechanically operated piano wire.  What is the connection between the victims and why is the killer doing it?

  Asia Argento (daughter of Dario Argento) is a bulemic who must hunt for the person responsible for beheading her two parents.  Laurie Piper (who played Carrie White's mother in ""Carrie"") is Asia's strange mom who was performing a sance on the night she lost her head.  Christopher Rydell is the young man who risks everything in order to help Asia track down the serial killer before he/she can kill the last victims.

  ""Trauma"" takes a serious departure from reality when a decapitated head utters the name of a doctor before ""dying"" and another head screams as it falls down an elevator shaft.  This last scene was almost comical in its implausibility.  However, this modern giallo does offer some mystery and suspense even if the murders are repetitious.  A nice rock n' roll score would've helped.  Perhaps a score from ""Talking Heads?""",1207612800,2,1384,5.008771929824562
533463,2,630300413X,"I feel very indifferent about ""Trauma"". It's not a great movie, but it's also not so bad that I feel like ripping it apart for 300 words. ""Trauma"" was made after, what is considered by many to be, the peak period of Dario Argento's career (the period between ""Deep Red"" and ""Opera"", which also includes ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomenon"" and ""Tenebrae"" - let's just pretend that ""Inferno"" doesn't exist), and is the beginning of a period of films that are not so much bad, as simply inferior to their great predecessors.

""Trauma""'s plot is very simple. Anorexic teenager, Aura (played by Argento's teenage daughter, Asia Argento), witnesses the deaths of her psychic parents at the hands of the Head Hunter, a serial killer who, as the names suggests, decapitates his victims. With the help of a news artist (Christopher Rydell), Aura then sets about solving the murders. You can probably fill in the rest. Nothing about this film really stands out: the acting is mediocre, the plot is mediocre; the only exception to this is the ending, which is so ludicrous that it is (unintentionally) laugh-aloud funny. This film is basically of the caliber of your average straight-to-DVD movie or tele-movie, and is only disappointing when you realize just how brilliant some of Argento's previous works truly are.",1206403200,,1295,4.99537037037037
533464,4,630300413X,"My four star rating is only in comparison to Argentos previous work, this still destroy's mostly anything else that doesn't have Agento's name on it. Trauma walks a fine line between 'classic' Argento and a failure to live up to his previous standards. If you compare it shot-by-shot (like I have) to his best work it's really not that far off, but as a whole it doesn't come close to film's like Suspiria, Tenebre, Deep Red, Opera ect. While it doesn't reach the level of those film's those are pretty high standards, and I'd still rather watch this than well...non-Argento film's. The special effects are done by Tom Savini (talk about a match made in heaven!!!!) and there are some pretty great effect's and gore, but the deaths aren't as 'beautiful' (bellissimo!!!) as his earlier film's. Sadly Trauma was intended to be Dario's goriest film but the suits had to interfere. Argento and Savini were very upset by this (as am I), some more gore really would have upped the ante.
There is no Goblin music in this one which kind of hurts the rating but the orchestral score was still pretty good. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the Goblin boys though.
Overall Trauma is a must see for fan's of Argento, there are pleny of classic Argento qualities like great lighting and cinematography, awesomely bizarre plot lines, and good death scenes, just don't go expecting Suspiria or anything. Highly recommended.",1205107200,,1412,4.7673469387755105
533465,2,630300413X,"Dario Argento's first US feature, Trauma, is a film I'd like to like more, partially because it's obviously so personal for Argento but largely because it's depressing to see how ineffectual most of his later films are. In many ways this feels like the work of an overambitious newbie rather than an experienced director: shots seem clumsily timed, performance styles are all over the place and the script is an undisciplined mess of good and bad ideas. Partially inspired by his stepdaughter's anorexia (she can be seen dancing in the film's end credits) to shock her out of it - an intention that would seem to be somewhat undone by Asia Argento taking dieting tips from her to play the troubled anorexic lead - much of it feels like an awkward reworking of past hits. Like Profondo Rosso/Deep Red the plot is triggered by a sance where a medium identifies a killer among those present, and the film features such Argento favorites as ill-fated lizards, elevator-assisted decapitations and a twist that hinges on a misinterpretation of what you think you see (although in this case the key shot is so badly photographed you literally CAN'T see it).

There are a few very subtle references to Les Miserables and the French Revolution (most pleasingly in a shot of Piper Laurie in front of a window with the curtain drawn aside to look like a guillotine blade) thrown in along with other half-developed ideas, but even the seemingly foolproof sequences are executed in a haphazard and workmanlike fashion, although there is one nicely inspired moment of improvisation when a killer who only strikes during rainstorms has to despatch a victim in a hotel room on a clear day. Argento's former visual prowess is little in evidence, the mastery of color that was such a feature of his earlier films reduced to a bland palette, but unfortunately many of his old weaknesses are all too apparent. Chief among them is a lot of really terrible acting: between Piper Laurie's tiresome histrionics and Frederic Forrest's Dwight Frye School of Overacting mad doctor, this may be one of the few films where Brad Dourif seems comparatively grounded. Neither of the leads, both played by the children of directors, can compensate, with Christopher Rydell faring only slightly better than Asia Argento, whose offscreen commitment to the role never translates onscreen.

If you're an Argento completist there's probably a bit more here than for the casual viewer, but it's thin stuff, though Anchor Bay's Region 1 NTSC DVD is fairly generous on extras, including four scenes deleted from the US version (two of which are minor plot points somewhat confusingly directly referred to in the US version).",1203206400,,2683,4.96
533466,4,630300413X,"When it came to the 90s most horror filmmakers who got their start in the late 60s and the 70s featured a major drop off in their work in the 90s. Most filmmakers as they get older don't get better. Of course there are always exceptions. In the case of Dario Argento's Trauma where most filmmakers from his era were on the decline, Dario was one of the few who still managed to put together a solid film.

From the 90s to even now, some of the great horror filmmakers made their weakest and even worst films of their career. Argento isn't free of that either. But Trauma in my opinion is a very solid Giallo by Dario Argento. Of all the films by Iconic horror filmmakers in the 90s Trauma I believe is one of the best. As fans we cannot help, but compare a filmmaker's later work to their early work. Trauma doesn't have the tension and dread of films like Deep Red or Tenebre; While visually Trauma is well done, it's Argento so that goes without saying, but no the film isn't as visually stunning as Suspiria and Inferno.

But even with those factors it doesn't make Trauma a bad film at all. Several times through out Dario Argento shows flashes of what made him such a loved filmmaker. There are moments with some solid tension even if it isn't as solid as Argento's prior work.

The script by Dario Argento & T.E.D. Klein is well written; I think that even the biggest of Dario Argento fans can agree that while, not a bad writer by any means the screenplays weren't the strongest parts of his movies. Even though Trauma may not be his best picture, I do believe it's one of Argento's better written movies. As I stated before the tension and dread isn't as well done as some of his other movies, but there is still some solid suspenseful moments in Trauma.

The scenes are well paced there are some slow moments, but Argento never lets it get boring. The pace of the movie moves well and Argento creates some decent tension. The acting is pretty good; while none of the performances will blow you away the actors do a fine job. Christopher Rydell delivers a solid performance and Asia Argento shows great promise, which I believe she lived up to.

Both Rydell and Asia Argento are able to make their characters very likeable and have a rather solid script to work with. The anorexia aspect of the movie actually plays out well. Its obvious Argento took the time and put care into it. I personally think that helped add a lot more depth to the movie and added the depth of the characters.

The score by Pino Donaggio is well done, but it does sound too much like the typical American thriller. While I did like the score, I have to be honest I would have preferred Goblin, which is what Argento originally wanted.

The look of the movie is quite well done, which is something Argento's movies are known for. Good movie or not they always have a great style to them. Like I stated earlier from a visual side you won't find another Suspiria or Inferno, but regardless the visual style is well done.

My only real complaint is the gore. Despite what a lot of people say, Argento movies really aren't known for their gore. While yes, some of his work does feature gore, but I wouldn't in any way call them gore movies, and quite honestly Argento doesn't need gore to make his movies work. Most of the time the murders are so beautifully shot the last thing on our mind is the gore.

But the reason it bothers me here a bit is logic would tell you if you get bashed in the head with a hammer you will bleed. When dealing with decapitations well you are gonna bleed.  Even though the make up F/X were done by Tom Savini there isn't very much of the red stuff. But the decapitations look great. In no way do they look fake; it's just that when dealing with murders like that you need more than just some blood running down the neck. Despite all that the F/X looks excellent.

In my personal opinion Trauma is an excellent and much underrated movie by Dario Argento. Granted it may not be as solid as some his earlier work, but it can stand proud next to them even if not as good. I think fans of Dario Argento should give this another try, while it's hard not to compare this to his earlier work if you take the movie for what it is you'll see it is a solid movie in a time when most of the Iconic horror filmmakers were on a major decline in product. For those new to Argento I would recommend watching his earlier stuff first and working your way up to Trauma.

In closing, while Trauma may not be one of Dario Argento's best movies, it still is well done and some what suspenseful Giallo with an excellent mystery.",1178496000,,4615,4.3534883720930235
533467,3,630300413X,"Throughout the 1990's the output of Italian horror specialist Dario Argento began to increasingly look as though it was tailored for his daughter Asia. This tailoring also coincided with a general downturn in both quality and inspiration. The three films he made with Asia ""Trauma"", ""The Stendahl Syndrome"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"" are all quite notable for an unusually dour and drab visual quality. Argento regularly took liberty with his narratives, but even by Argento standards this trilogy of below par films are riddled with absurd contradictions and discontinuities. Of the three I prefer ""Trauma"", simply because like ""Opera"" before, it is based on a very good method of murder and is aided by some notable actors. Like most post 1980 horror films it is basically a series of set pieces connected by a gossamer thread of narrative, in this case a lot of nonsense involving dead children and vengeful mothers. Unlike other Argento efforts the culprit of much decapitating chaos is screamingly obvious, and the whole thing unravels into a rather a soppy love story. Asia Argento is given much material to work with; anorexia, a psychopathic mother and suicidal tendencies, she does little of note with this potentially intriguing material and neither does Dario. The usual bag of tricks are present (subjective camera angles - even from the P.O.V of a butterfly!! And well executed death scenes), but at this point in Argento's career one can't help thinking he'd lost the plot a bit.",1170979200,3,1493,5.048582995951417
533468,3,630300413X,"Trauma (Dario Argento, 1993)

Dario Argento has been making stylish, intelligent thrillers for four decades now. As is to be expected with a director who has close to twenty films in the can, his output has been a little inconsistent over the years. Trauma is on the up side of things, but it's not one of his best efforts.

David Parsons (For the Boys' Christopher Rydell) is an ex-junkie working as an artist for the local TV station. On his way home from work one night, he sees Aura Petrescu (Asia Argento of xXx and b. Monkey) getting ready to jump off a bridge. He stops her and convinces her to go for coffee with him. This does not work well, and she is accosted after running away from him. She is taken back home to her parents, spiritualists Adriana (Carrie's Piper Laurie) and Stefan (L'Ange's Dominique Serrand) after begging her accosters not to take her back to the Faraday Clinic, from which she had escaped just before the suicide attempt. On her first night home, however, not only do her parents call the clinic's head, Dr. Judd (Frederic Forrest, of Hammett fame), but during a s&eacute;ance, a series of confusing events occurs that leads to Adriana and Stefan's death. With nowhere else to turn, Aura goes back to David, and the two of them try to figure out who the killer is before he gets to Aura.

While the cinematography is pure Argento, much of the rest of the atmospheric trappings that make Argento films so wonderful are missing; most notably, the music is nowhere near the quality Argento got when working with Goblin. But a thriller doesn't have to be an Argento film to be good. How's the rest of it? The acting is a mixed bag; Frederic Forrest, especially, is painfully bad, the polar opposite of the brilliant, engaging actor who made Hammett such a treat. Piper Laurie reprises here Carrie role well, and while Argento's acting is not on par with movies she would make later in her career, she's acceptable. Brad Dourif also scores a role that's little more than a cameo, but he milks it for what it's worth. The plot can be a bit on the confusing side if you're not paying close enough attention, so be warned, but it does all come together in the end.

What will most disappoint diehard Argento fans, likely, is the almost complete lack of gore. Blame Argento's having made this film in America. He does get away with a decent amount, but it's a far cry from Profondo Rosso or even Non Ho Sonno.

All that said, I rather liked it; certainly more than I expected to, given the generally negative views of the film one finds in various places on the net. It'll probably be enjoyed more by those who aren't already students of Argento than those who are. ***",1139270400,7,2695,4.5484536082474225
533539,3,630300413X,"This Dario Argento movie is not as bad as people say it is. But it's definately not his best film. I think the main reason is the acting. Asia Argento and Piper Laurie are pretty bad in this film. Asia's english wasn't as good as it is now and she seems to mumble her lines which can get pretty annoying at times. Piper Laurie seems to try to capture her amazing performance as the ""crazy"" mother in the classic ""Carrie"" film, but she fails. She's just so over the top and it hurts the film. But I'm glad Anchor Bay finally released the Uncut version of this film. The VHS version had a lot of the gore created by the great Tom Savini edited out. I give 3 1/2 stars for the film and 4 for this DVD release. And by the way, ""The Stendthal Syndrome"" & ""Sleepless"" aren't bad movies.

(Though those films would probably be a lot more enjoyable if they had a decent DVD relase)  Yeah, it is fairly American-ized, but this isn't an entirely bad thing.

It's sad that he didn't put a bit more into the death scenes, or this could've been one of his best movie. (Course, that's quite a big just, as the death scenes and setpieces are what make his best films so cool)  They aren't bad, certainly, a lot nice gliding steadicam, but the kills themselves are kinda dull, as they're all the same.  (The killer has an automatic decapitating machine, which is less interesting than it sounds.)  Still, despite the straight thriller trappings, the plot does degenerate into your standard giallo-ism, i.e. false endings, faked deaths, killer whose identity is incredibly unlikely for a variety of reasons, clues which a so subtle and esoteric as to be virtually worthless etc.  Oddly enough, this combination kinda works, combining a somewhat more believable, controlled investigation with a wild, over the top final act.

All right, the plot's like this, there's a murderer, who is murdering people, and a variety of characters who do not wish to be murdered, and thus decide to prevent it.  Also, one of these people is troubled and anorexic, which doesn't get too much in the way of the main plot, fortunately.  (Also, they don't try and get the police too involved in all this, cause that wouldn't be very sporting.)  The main not wanna be murdereders are Aura and David, played by Asia Argento and Christopher Rydell.  Neither of them are particularly interesting, but what do you expect.  They're certainly more naturalistic than your typical Argento protagonists, but they kinda lack presonality, in spite of Aura's problems. (She's the anorexic one_  Other than that no one matters too much, though you do have an assortment of oddball random characters i.e. dorky little kid who sees too much, crazy as hell doctor etc.

What can I say, this movie is a little more wacky than your typical Argento movie, kinda like 'Phenomena. It just kinda lurches from each plot development to the next, each more random and unusual than the last.  Still, the individual scenes do tend to work on a conventional dramatic level, again partially due to the conventional American styling.  The scene where Aura's parents get wasted is particularly nice, if conventional, and the major stalking scene in the hospital is very well done.  If it had some nice gruesome, traditional Argento butchery in it it would be totally top notch.  Still, this film has some interesting violence.  Tom Savini does the gore, so it's naturally of heigh quality.  It mostly consists of a few severed head props and various shots of wire digging into the victims neck.

Sadly, it's got a traditional, orchestrated Hollywood score, nowhere near as good as the stuff you'd usually here in an Argento film.  But, you can't have it all.

All in all, a pretty cool film.  It's probably more of an Argento film than you'd think, considering what you've likely heard about it.  Also, I'm feeling stupid right now, so this excessively informal review might make it seem like I view this as a camp film.  I don't.  It's got some weirdness, for sure, but it works if you can get into it, which I can.

p.s.  Asia Argento briefly gets nude in this movie.  She was only a teenager at the time, so if you find yourself.... aroused by this scene, you need to report yourself to the FBI immediately. Sorry.  It's your duty.  Though lotsa people are bound to mention this, it is kinda weird to have your teenage daughter get naked in your movie. I don't care what country your from.  Also, it's utterly gratuitous, which makes it all the more... odd.

533542,4,630300413X,"Trauma is Argento's American giallo film.  It's quite Americanized, but unmistakably Argento.  The plot concerns Rydell(who looks a little like Brenden Fraser at times) who stops a young anorexic girl(Asia Argento) from committing suicide, and then gets tangled up with her psychological baggage as well as a black gloved killer(of course) who's after Argento.  The killer's modus operandi this time around is decapitating victims with a handy dandy little power tool soon to be available at your nearest Sears Craftsman Tool department.  Why is the killer doing this?  Who is the killer?  Watch it and see.  Naturally this is a wonderfully shot film, but a bit toned down from Argento's previous works.  Good performances all around, but Rydell and Argento are especially good together.  We also get a cameo from everyone's favorite B movie character actor, Brad Dourif.  It's also a bit creepy that Asia has a brief topless scene considering she was only 16 at the time, and her father is the director.  Those wacky Italians!  All in all Trauma doesn't make my Aregento top five films list, but because it is Argento it's better than just about everything else out there in the same genre.  See it before they remake it.",1125187200,3,1222,4.960591133004926

533544,2,630300413X,"Argento seems to be able to make GREAT horror as POOR ones. With a plot he already used a couple of times and filmed like he did also a couple of times, Dario Argento offers his daughter, not a bad actress at all, in one of his average work. It's no his worst movie but it's not fantastic either. The Hitchcock theme sounds sometimes like a very low budget music score, a pity! For me, not the revelation of Dario Argento's Art...This film could have been released decades ago, it's more like he didn't evolve at all and he simply makes the same recipe again and again.

Filled with bloody violence, sickly twisted family liaison, and absolutely over-the-top campy fun. A masterpiece? Depends what your definition is. I think it's one of it's own kind. Asia was adorable (and still is.) Above all, I love Piper Laurie in this movie, period. Can't wait for the DVD to come out.",1057881600,4,495,4.767441860465116
533546,2,630300413X,"I was lucky enough to find a tape of the uncut edition of TRAUMA. Yet again the story features a serial killer, this one named the Head Hunter because his prefered method of killing is decapitating his victims with a bandsaw. After a teenage girl, Aura (Asia Argento, the director's daughter) witnesses the deaths of her parents at the hands of the Head Hunter the trauma lands her in a mental hospital... but still the killer comes after her, determined to finish what he started. The psycho also has a strange M.O: he only kills when it's raining.
TRAUMA is generally pretty tedious, with little evidence of the director's trademark stylistic flourishes. Rather disappointing, though Asia Argento gives a good performance; and there are a couple of memorable bits: the sequence where a woman's decapitated head speaks; and Brad Dourif's death scene. Piper Laurie co-stars, but you're better off watching PHENOMENA (aka CREEPERS) or SUSPIRIA. And what's with the reggae music at the end?",1045353600,3,988,5.030487804878049
533547,3,630300413X,"Weird yet compelling little horror movie brought by Dario Argento, Trauma was his first production done in America. The story is,in most of its part,typical of 80's slasher pictures, but the idea of a ""Head Hunter"" killing people around is somewhat original and also responsible for some of the most grotesque scenes I've seen in a horror movie(like the scene of a decapitated woman whose head keeps talking for a while).The usual Argento stuff is all over Trauma: the different and frantic camera movements, the violence and the strange characters.

533548,4,630300413X,"There are some good stuff here to be sure. Argento-fans tend to rate this way down on the scale and criticize it for being to ""americanized"". I don't agree. Sure, there is a certain sense of ""half-baked Argento"" here and there, but I don't find that to be a minus point. If anything, being made in the states, it has more convincing performances and the production values can not be faulted. It's look may seem aneamic if viewed beside ""Suspiria"" or something more of Argento's more gaudy creations, but I think that this is intentional. Cinematography it absolutely top-notch, conveying a suitably spooky atmosphere to many scenes. The story is fairly straight-forward for an Argento movie, but not standard fare, and if this had been made by a newcomer it would have been hailed as very solid suspenser indeed. The plot twists and turns even if the outcome isn't too much of a surprise. However, one thing really bothers me about ""Trauma"". The sfx-work by Tom Savini is truly awful. Some scenes, like the one in the elevator-shaft, start creepy enough but are ruined by the effects overall cheesiness (the falling head is only laughable instead of frightening). Shame on you, Savini! Bring on Sergio Stivalletti! Another thing that's not very good is Pino Donaggios score, which he seems to have composed in his sleep. It's not bad, it's just that it seems so routine. Compared to ""Deep red"" and a few others, this is not Argento at his best.

7834169,4,630300413X,"""Trauma"" is a much better film than any that Dario Argento has since released. His talents for colour and composition are fully in evidence in this early-90s giallo, which I would rank alongside his lesser two or three films from the 70s and 80s.

The plot is about a murderer whose MO is decapitation. Argento's daughter, Asia, stars alongside a male lead. Psychological damage of various kinds is a running theme, but as usual Argento is mainly concerned with creating a dreamlike atmosphere of suspense. The soundtrack is a little weak, but the cinematography is excellent and so are Tom Savini's special effects.",1378771200,2,616,4.980582524271845

My high hopes and excited anticipation were smashed
upon the jagged rocks of mediocrity.
It had potential, and given the writer and director,
Dario Argento, who has written some of the greatest
screenplays and directed some of the greatest films
ever made, it ought to have been great.
It is a weak and uninspired effort.

What is up with the musical score?
Usually a strong point in Argento's films,
the music is terrible.

This one is not even worthy of hard-core Argento fans,
but they will check it out anyway because they have to,
so if your one of those, go ahead,
otherwise I recommend ""The Bird With The Crystal Plumage"",
""Tenebre"", ""Inferno"", ""Sleepless"", ""Suspiria"", ""Deep Red"",
""Opera"" and ""Phenomena"".
If your an Asia Argento fan, check out daddy Dario's
""The Stendhal Syndrome"".

movies made this one except for some of his signature
techniques.",1308528000,,941,4.875
