4465512,5,B004TCPW80,"I wish that Marvel would actually make some of their movies as dark and serious as these episodes. Not a full out cartoon, but the way the artists transfer from one picture to another one could easily be fooled.",1389830400,2,211,4.435897435897436
4465513,4,B004TCPW80,"The Marvel knights stories are not for young children. That being said for the mature comic book fan they are incredible. If your looking for the basic rock-em sock-em stories, you might want to keep looking. The marvel knights stories tend to focus more on character developments and explorations, and less on battles. There are battles which have some epic levels but much more time is spent on examining the mental states of the heroes. My only real complaint is it would be nice if the episodes played as one movie instead of the broadcasted 15 mins with intro's and credits in between each one.",1345075200,16,599,4.714285714285714
4465514,4,B004TCPW80,"Nothing ages faster than science fiction. The sci-fi of the 80's that was produced in the US is mostly quaint and dated now; almost innocent. But all science fiction serves as a diagnosis of the time and place it was produced.

Watching ""To the Stars by Hard Ways"" offers a fascinating glimpse into a culture most Americans don't understand, and have many preconceived ideas about. Sure, the special effects are,,, let's be kind and say unimpressive by modern standards (they did the best they could with what they had). Some of it stunk of cheese, the plot occasionally dragged; and once in a while Soviet propaganda reared its ugly head to remind us of the ""glories"" of communism.

But it's real value is in the portrait of the underlying idealism of the Russians a decade before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The overall effect of the story and production is simultaneously exotic, confusing, attractive, and familiar. The Russians, it seems, had their own imaginary hopes of what their society would evolve into and face that which they feared; and attempted to create an artistic model for this. All fiction does this to some degree wether its creator realizes it or not. And it also shows that despite the demented situations politicians impose upon us, people have more in common than they realize.

It's an historical artifact that's certainly worth looking at.",1310256000,6,1373,4.9094827586206895
