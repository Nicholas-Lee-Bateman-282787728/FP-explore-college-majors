4489018,2,B004WPYO38,"Despite the great cast, this film fails to make sense on any level.  I suppose if that is the definition of ""indy"" then, yes, this is a great indy film, completely full of itself, so full that the actors are directed to stare blankly at the camera at times and just let the viewer try to figure out what is going on.  Ultimately it does become clear that the film has a lot to do with pedophilia (a great actor - Cieran Hinds - given almost nothing to do except THINK about his past actions) and dysfunction (what a waste of Ally Sheedy's talent to give her a cameo as a deranged narcissist and then forget about her). It was a waste of time, money, and most especially talent. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the actors kept me believing that it would get better.",1311897600,3,771,4.202702702702703
4489019,4,B004WPYO38,"Todd Solondz is one of the more notable independent film makers. You can pick his work out of the crowd. ""Life During Wartime"" is no exception. It's pretty much an extension of his earlier ""Happiness"" both in style and content.

Here's the scoop. You meet a group of individuals who are all related by either blood or circumstance. Each has a story (two involving sexual perversion) that colors the way they view life and interact with others. One wife has a husband who is in prison on a pedophile conviction. She's told their children that their dad has died. Her sister is married to a guy who has some unspecified sexual quirks. She needs to take a break from him to see how she feels. These are just a sampling.

This is a slice of lifer that is all writing and acting. Nothing is set up, plot-wise, in the beginning that has to be resolved by the end. Things do happen. Things do change. But these people's lives will go on in one way or the other. One of the repeating themes is forgiveness. What do you do when someone you love does something you simply cannot get past? Can you forgive and forget? Can you forgive but not forget. Can you forget but not forgive? These permutations arise repeatedly throughout the movie.

There is no razzle dazzle here. The camera is quiet. It doesn't move a lot but allows things to happen within the frame. The color schemes are interesting and help hold the viewer's attention. The acting is very good. It's peppered with a lot of veterans that have a ton of years and projects under their belts.

This is a good movie, but not necessarily for everyone's taste. Some of the subject matter and dialogue might make more sensitive viewers squirm, but if you like independent film making this is a must see.

4489020,4,B004WPYO38,I like movies that standout and this one is different for sure. It picks up where happiness left off. It is a movie of people and their flaws and those who associate with them and even loved them despite the err of their ways. We as individuals do not know who is watching us or the effect we have on each other. It is a little slow but sticks with you after viewing.,1366588800,,367,4.041095890410959
4489021,2,B004WPYO38,"Amazon's description says this is a ""hilarious new film.""  I got a few uncomfortable chuckles out of it, but ""hilarious"" is not the right word.  I don't dislike art house films or character studies or whatever you call this subgenre of film, but this one was pretty slow, weak, and boring in my opinion.  I still haven't seen Happiness from this same director, but I'm hoping it will be the more potent version of this film that the other reviewers mention.",1365811200,,457,4.617283950617284
4489022,2,B004WPYO38,"I was so much looking forward to this movie, but it didn't live up to the trailer, which showed the best parts of the dialogue. The characters were too dismal, even for me, and they weren't very well-drawn.* Plus there was no plot to speak of. The only thing that kept me going were the verbal exchanges, which had a certain thoroughness you don't get in a lot of movies. In sum, I could have lived my life without having seen this movie. Solondz's films always are always like that for me. They are quirky and interesting to a degree while I'm watching them, but I can never remember them because they don't tell a compelling story with believable, consistent characters.*

*Example of what I mean by mis-drawn and inconsistent characterizations: In one of the early scenes, the mother comes back from a date and tells her 11-year-old son way more about it than is appropriate. It's like she's talking to a friend, not her son. OK, fine. Great idea for a character. The problem is, later on she just turns into a normal mom. It's like the writer/director forgot that he had created a neurotic, no-sense-of-boundaries character, like he didn't know what to do with her after he had created her.",1352073600,,1194,4.632075471698113
4489023,2,B004WPYO38,"Spare me.

Pretentious, art-house nonsense like this has to be made I guess, for some reason; but does it have to be THIS boring??

I rented this ode to sleeping pills because someone I trusted recommended it. Now he is going on my ""suspect critic"" list. Egads! One boring story full of weirdos after another, full of scenes that go nowhere. ""Weird"" does not always equal ""good"". The whole mess left me cold.

Yep, I don't ""get it"", thank goodness. If I ever do, hopefully I will still have enough sense to lock myself up in the nearest loony bin..",1323302400,,548,4.46
4489024,5,B004WPYO38,"A few years ago I watched this film at a local art house. A few days ago I was making coffee and it must have been the swirling motion in my cup (as I stirred in the cream and sugar) that hypnotized me, causing the resurfacing of a few repressed memories - namely from this film.

As I recall, there were about seven or eight other people in the theater, most of whom were sitting by themselves and probably not mentally prepared for the hour and a half long ride of horrifying abnormality and sheer discomfort that is typical of director Todd Solondz's films, which according to Wikipedia are inspired by his experiences growing up in New Jersey - and I BELIEVE IT, wholeheartedly. So, why did I give five stars to this film? Mainly because of the circumstances under which I watched it. As I mentioned, Solondz's films are abnormal and discomforting, which made watching this film amongst complete strangers in a dark theater and from the back row quite amusing. Like in true horror movie fashion it was not uncommon to see people sinking down into their chairs, letting out sharp gasps and sighs, covering their faces, and turning their heads disapprovingly from side to side. As for myself, I too was taken by surprise, especially when the young boy (Timmy) cries out ""I hope I NEVER get molested!"" At that point I pretty much lost control and had to gag myself with my coat because I didn't want to appear rude and insensitive towards the subject matter or attract the glaring faces of the combined seven or eight people in the audience. I think this movie really got the better of some people.

Without question, this is the work of Todd Solondz.",1317772800,5,1652,4.596610169491526
4489025,5,B004WPYO38,"A more adult sequel to Happiness with a new cast reinterpreting the characters.

4489026,1,B004WPYO38,"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters were dismal, the subject matter was tragic and it was so slow.",1313625600,,134,4.0
4489027,3,B004WPYO38,"As expected, Criterion releases another excellent package here. Starting with beautiful artwork on the cover and inside the booklet insert. The picture quality of this Criterion Collection blu-ray is excellent. The color is vivid and different but adds to the overall mood of the film. This is an acquired taste as far as films go. It is definitely indie and has a twisted dark comedy style. There are some really good scenes, good acting, and some clever lines but it lacks in cohesiveness. There are things to like here but overall it seems to be trying too hard to be weird. It works about 60% of the time and then the rest just seems to lack the glue to hold it all together. I would compare this film to a combination of Wes Anderson meets David Lynch with a dash of Coen Brothers only not quite as genius as those greats. Where Wes Anderson and David Lynch's work seems to flow effortlessly, this film on the other hand tries too hard to be something that it just never quite succeeds at. I did like the movie and it shows promise that director Todd Solondz is talented and does have the ability to make a masterpiece. This movie is just not that masterpiece. Hopefully he will continue to develop his talents and present us with something incredible in the coming years. I do recommend this movie if you like dark twisted comedies about Americans in the suburbs. Just expect to be scratching your head with some slight confusion when the credits start rolling unexpectedly. Maybe that was the intent?

4489028,3,B004WPYO38,"Todd Solondz' ""Happiness"" is one of the most disturbing films I'd ever seen. It's also excellent. It explores the ickiest, most pathetic and repulsive parts of modern human life, and deftly combines tragedy with pitch-black humor. Over a decade later, Solondz clearly felt the need to revisit the characters from that film, hence this sequel ""Life During Wartime"". Instead of trying to recruit the original actors to reprise their roles, Solondz chose to completely recast them, allowing a new cast to breath life into these characters.

As much as I wanted to love this film, throughout it I couldn't shake the feeling of it being a somewhat unnecessary sequel. The plot of ""Happiness"" loosely revolved around the stories of three sisters, and despite the years that have gone by, the characters haven't really changed much. Joy is still wimpy, optimistic, and drawn to self-destructive, damaged men. Helen is still arrogant and entitled. The only character who seems at least somewhat different is Trish. In the first film, before discovering her husband's pedophilia, she was a smug control freak. Years later, the character reeks of desperation while trying to recreate the ""normal"" life for herself that she thought she once had.

The themes of ""Life During Wartime"" are also mostly the same as those of ""Happiness"": trauma, shame, guilt, disappointment, and the part family plays in all of these things. The new film differs only slightly from its predecessor by also exploring the theme (or maybe just the possibility) of redemption. This exploration is apparent in the storyline of Bill Maplewood, Trish's ex-husband, just released from prison. Free, yet dazed and aimless, he wanders through the film like a ghost, having a strange dalliance with a nihilistic woman he meets at a bar (played by the always compelling Charlotte Rampling) and tracking his son down at College. Joy's character also seems to be looking for redemption; despite the fact that, unlike Bill, her guilt is completely unjustified, and she bears no real responsibility for those she feels she failed (two self-destructive, and ultimately suicidal, boyfriends).

Mostly, what saves the film from redundancy are the performers, and some of the casting choices are truly inspired. Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy all do well inhabiting, and breathing some fresh life into, the characters originally played by Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson, and Lara Flynn Boyle. And some of the choices made for the supporting cast are phenomenal ... one example being Paul Reuben's ghostly re-interpretation of the character originally played by Jon Lovitz.

Overall, I think Todd Solondz would have been better off exploring some new characters. But by bringing a fresh cast to the table, and at least trying to expand their horizons thematically, ""Life During Wartime"" manages to come across more as an interesting experiment by a talented director than a redundant rehash.",1312934400,2,2957,5.245243128964059
4489029,4,B004WPYO38,"At first glance, LIFE DURING WARTIME seems not so much a sequel to his lauded 1998 film HAPPINESS as a reimagining of it. The themes remain similar, but the cast is entirely different. The characters are the same, but the tone seems to have shifted from pitch-black comedy to a sadder, more soulful feel. While all this is true, LIFE DURING WARTIME picks up ten years after HAPPINESS left off, and focuses almost exclusively on how a family beseeched with sadness, insanity and perversion tries to move on in the face of decades of accumulated resentment. Forgiveness is a key component of whether or not they fail or succeed, and Solondz spends most of the films' 98 minute running time quietly ruminating on whether or not you can truly ""forgive the unforgivable.""

The cast may be different, but the performances are yet again uniformly excellent, with the strongest coming from young Dylan Riley Snider as the soul-searching 13 year old Timmy Maplewood, Alison Janney as his impenetrably chipper mom, Trish and Michael Kenneth Williams as the recovering-pervert husband of Trish's sister Joy.

While not for everyone, Solondz asks difficult questions in his films. He doesn't provide easy answers, nor does he preach to the audience or mock his characters. He treats them deftly and with sensitivity and this, in the end, adds a weightier subtext to what, in lesser hands, could be seen as a mere freakshow.",1311984000,,1411,4.949367088607595

Tries to recapture in some way the first film with different actors, and ends up being a self-congratulatory mess in how they keep referencing the first film.  I think at some point it morphs into a DOLLHOUSE sequel - this was really bad.  Maybe one day I'll give it another chance and amend my review if I think any different - but otherwise - to this day the onlly 2 great films Solondz has ever made was DOLLHOUSE (great) and HAPPINESS (masterpiece.)

8445564,5,B004WPYO38,"Good package. First copy badly packaged for shipping (see separate package review). I found it mildly annoying that the director or editor chose to degrade (my term, not theirs) the video by increasing the scene contrast and shifting the color temperature toward yellow.  Perhaps it would have been less annoying if done more subtly.

I wonder why Amazon doesn't always allow a search by director? I don't really care that Shirley Henderson is involved. Why not highlight Allison Janney? Tis a mystery.

Otherwise, a recommended film.",1467158400,,534,5.186046511627907
