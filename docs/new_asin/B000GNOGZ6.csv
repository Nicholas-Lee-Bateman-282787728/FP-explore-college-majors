8133713,4,B000GNOGZ6,"This was a British TV Series and is on one disc in three episodes. A happily married woman receives anonymous email claiming that her husband is having an affair with a secretary in his office. At first totally skeptical, she gradually is drawn to the malicious emails because they seem to have more than a grain of truth. Both she and her husband become entangled in a murder web, each doubting the other's innocence.  But, who is pulling the strings?  Who is the real murderer?  Was the husband really unfaithful?  A cast of other characters adds depth and mystery. This is not an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, but it has a charm of its own and keeps you guessing until the end.",1224633600,7,677,4.570247933884297

I bought it and really enjoyed it! The ending was a total surprise! The acting was great! It really moves along, no dragging. I will watch this again and again! If you like a good mystery this is one to see.",1178928000,14,369,3.8051948051948052
