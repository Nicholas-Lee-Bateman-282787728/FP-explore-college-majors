8024665,5,B00029RSYU,i got this at Giant Supermarket in a dvd bin. what a find! maybe not the same energy as the original line up but it isn't the all original lineup. if you look at the audience expressions this tells all. this was a blast! im a harsh critic but i will recommend this to any mc5 fans.,1380585600,,281,3.9473684210526314
8024666,3,B00029RSYU,"Believe this one-off {?} gig took place at the 100 Club in London. As good as it was to be able to see the MC 5's three surviving members - guitarist Wayne Kramer, bassist Michael Davis and drummer Dennis Thomas reunite after all these years was fun to experience, 'Sonic Revolution' isn't anything to get all THAT hyped up about. It's decent...good, not great but good. After three times of watching this concert DVD, I put it on the shelf. I'll watch it again sometime, just not all the time. Guest vocalists they had show up to sing on at least one song included Lemmy, Ian Astbury (The Cult), Nick Royale (Hellacopters) and Dave Vanian (The Damned) did a fine job and all but there seems to be something STILL missing from this DVD. Track listing is the best thing about this DVD, like ""Shaking Street"", my personal MC 5 favorite - the foot-stomping ""Looking At You"", ""American Ruse"", ""Ramblin' Rose"" and the all too familiar ""KIck Out The Jams"". See how you like it.",1195084800,,971,4.554285714285714
8024667,1,B00029RSYU,"there nothing worse than seeing your heros mix with substandard fill ins to create a commerical waste of space, real fans want the real testimonial now- see the real band in pixelated glory on youtube and save your money until the true testomonial is released and not bootlegs selling for over a hunderd dollars,",1193184000,4,312,4.796296296296297
8024668,4,B00029RSYU,"First off this was done for money. Period. If the Levi's logo wasn't enough,  Brother Wayne has come out and said so himself. The labor of love comes in with the supporting acts. People tend to forget that Ian Astbury provided vocals for the Rob Tyner tribute all those years ago and no one bitched then. The Hellacopters have kept that ""hugh energy"" flame going along with Radio Birdman for years so please don't quibble about their cred. Even the bonus bit isn't bad, since it seems ol' Leni filmed alot of this with no sound (see ""Kick out the Jams"" you need an update). This is not bad until ""A True Testimonial"" gets a real release but I'm sure the other film of that time, ""Ten for Two"" may get released first as Yoko is more likely to kick than Wayne. But, in a few years there may not be enough folks around to care.",1168041600,2,824,4.282051282051282
8024669,5,B00029RSYU,"A real thrill to see Davis, Kramer and Thompson back together again.  It is obvious what a labor of love it was for all involved.  I particularly enjoyed Skunk, Shakin' Street, Poison and Rocket Reducer No. 62.  If you can get your hands on a copy of MC5: A True Testimonial (there are a few out there) I would recommend it also.",1113523200,,329,4.274193548387097
8024670,5,B00029RSYU,"Packed to the seams with special guests, archived footage, and content, Sonic Revolution is a spectacular dvd; it's only fault coming from the slightly weak audio mix that is presented for the concert aspect. Through repeated watching, it'll grow on you, just as the original MC5 should have, (if you're unitiated get up, run to the store, and pick up their revolutionary debut, Kick Out The Jams immediatly.)

On loan from his band the Hellacopters, Nicke Royale rips it up on the second guitar, (filling in for the unfortunatly deceased Fred Smith,) and gives more than fair vocal offerings to ""Gotta Keep Movin'"" and ""American Ruse."" Lemmy from the legendary Motorhead puts his vocal styling into a ripping version of ""Sister Anne,"" while Dave Vanian of The Damned, a long time fan of The MC5, boogies and tries his passionate and energetic best hand, (often with sucess,) at ""Tonight,"" ""Looking At You,"" and ""High School,"" as Ian Astbury fronts what is perhaps the climax of the show when he puts his soaring energy and gold-plated lungs into the helm of a stirring ""Kick Out The Jams.""

Right now it's time to...kick out the jams.

8024671,5,B00029RSYU,"This is the smartest 20 bucks I've spent in a long, long time. The band commentary over the home movie stuff is incredible and far more honest than anything I've ever heard or seen them do, and I've purchsed everything available on the group. There are no false claims of objectivity by producers looking for acclaim on this release, which makes it all the better. All first-person comments are from surviving band members who obviously know what they're saying without being manipulated. Good good stuff and excellent editing. The 1968 Defense Dept. footage from the convention is silent, but the way it is presented here is effective. The bonus TV program is worth the money alone.",1094688000,4,683,4.896551724137931
8024672,2,B00029RSYU,"This concert performance is plagued by uneven sound, an uneven performance and more than a few missing songs. By reading the liner notes there were more songs recorded for this DVD, but somehow they didn't manage to make the final cut. The notes say technical problems, but judging by the performances it could very well be that the MC5 was so bad that they couldn't use the footage.

It's shame this legendary band didn't record one of its current American shows for a DVD. That group was more well-rehearsed, but either touring group doesn't live up to the MC5's legendary status.

The extras on this DVD are good to watch once.  Other than that they provide no extended commentary on the history of the band.",1090454400,5,711,4.672
8024673,2,B00029RSYU,"It's a real shame that the incredible MC5 documentary ""MC5: A True Testimonial"" is held up in litigation so that this far inferior DVD can come out first. The main feature is the reunion/tribute performance, which is limp and boring. A number of punk & post-punk bands have reunited lately to show that they can still kick ass, MC5 is not one of them. I really hope that ""A True Testimonial"" gets an official DVD release eventually. As anyone who's managed to see it in festivals etc. will attest, it's much more interesting & exciting and touces on some darker aspects of the bands compelling history. Come on guys, sort out the money crap and let the story be told! If you want to attract new fans to the music, Sonic Revolution won't do it.",1089417600,18,743,4.511111111111111
