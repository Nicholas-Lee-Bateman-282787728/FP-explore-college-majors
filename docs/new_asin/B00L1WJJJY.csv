6462326,5,B00L1WJJJY,"My son loves Elmo and yet it is entertaining for anyone who loves comics.  Features Elmo as ""The Dark Nine"" and Leela as ""Princess Threea"" who solve the problems for many Sesame Street characters at ""Numeric-con."" Enjoyable to learn about numbers, solve problems, and experience Sesame Street as never before.",1441497600,,309,5.18

6462328,5,B00L1WJJJY,"Adorable parody of Comic-Con.  Characters like ""One-der Woman"" and ""The Green Four-net"" teach counting from one to ten.  My two year old can't get enough...and it keeps mommy and daddy entertained, too!",1425168000,,202,5.28125
6462329,5,B00L1WJJJY,My daughter LOVES this DVD. We never seem to catch Sesame Street when it's on tv so I got her this so she wouldn't be the only kid who didn't know the characters. It's was a huge hit. She stood up in front of the tv and looked in awe. It kept her very entertained.,1421452800,,264,3.8181818181818183

8663318,1,B00L1WJJJY,"Don't buy it! It's a weird mix of modern and old school, doesn't really have a story line. My two year old doesn't like it and she loves everything Elmo. Not even close to being worth the ten bucks",1521417600,,197,4.076923076923077
8663319,4,B00L1WJJJY,"Great video, but if you have HBO this is very very similar to an earlier episode that can be found in the 2014 Sesame Street segment. Had I known that we already had it on HBO I would not have bought it, but for $5 I can't complain too much. My 4 year old likes it.",1513900800,,265,3.75

8663323,5,B00L1WJJJY,"This is our favorite Elmo DVD, my only complaint... the bonus feature with Elmo's Shape Adventure with Andy Samberg is not the same screen size as everything else. It is ok on our TV because we can make the adjustment, but for others it may be a bit annoying... especially since it is such a great bonus feature!

The episode collection is wonderfully engaging that we don't mind watching over and over :)",1483142400,,405,4.5479452054794525
8663324,3,B00L1WJJJY,"The costumes are great number-based parodies of superheros, but the video is filled with video montage fillers that are focused on the numbers they are learning about, but they don't relate to the ""Numericon"" story.  My kids (5 years and 18 months) loved Elmo's Alphabet Challenge, and I was hoping for something more along those lines.  After watching once or twice, they ask to go back to the Alphabet Challenge video.",1477008000,,420,4.901408450704225
