8399159,3,B003L150FA,"Wild Target is a combination of Leon (a professional hitman teaching his trade to an apprentice) and Prizzis Honor, where romance complicates an assassins fulfilling his contract. Unfortunately Wild Target cant hold a candle to either of those films. Jean Rochefort is consistently watchable and the film holds ones attention for its 85 minutes but in striving so hard to be wacky it merely seems gauche  and how precisely does the wheelchair-bound mother manage to transport herself, apparently unaided, to the scene of action in the nick of time?",1499558400,,548,5.157303370786517
8399160,5,B003L150FA,"Cible emouvante (Wild Target) and the later English remake, Wild Target, both complement each other very well.  This original French version is concise at 85 minutes in dealing with the plot, with little extraneous action.  The remake with Bill Nighy is longer at 97 minutes which allows for somewhat more character development of the main characters, as well as a bit more action.  Rochefort and Nighy are perfect for their respective versions.  Marie Trintignant a little more adept than Emily Blunt at thieving. There are some minor differences in the plots unfolding between both versions, however, it is not a distraction, rather a nod to progress.  Both versions are wonderful black comedies and are part of my DVD collection.  I do recommend them.  Note, the original only plays on a region-free DVD player at this time.",1364774400,,827,5.036764705882353
8399161,5,B003L150FA,"First feature film by Pierre Salvadori, this film is a gem. Black comedy, completely shifted, the characters well built, it allows players to widely express their talent. By his tone more British than French, this film is a gem quite unique in the French production of the 90s. Jean Rochefort is magnificent killer. Subsequently, this director will be two other notable comedies same tone as LES APPRENTIS and COMME ELLE RESPIRE... before entering the mold more movies formatted.",1363564800,,479,5.153846153846154
8399162,4,B003L150FA,"When the English version of this excellent film arrived it allowed me to find the original.  I saw it fifteen years ago on television.  It was just as good as I remembered it and, surprisingly, I found the English version an excellent rendition.  Both films are excellent and I thoroughly recommend both.",1292112000,3,304,4.8076923076923075
