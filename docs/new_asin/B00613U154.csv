4924233,5,B00613U154,"Its only a little of an hour long, but the beauty and the calmness are transfixing.  There are 65 video clips where a camera sits stationary and watches the teeming aquatic life go about their daily business.  Most of the fish are juveniles and the animal and plant life sweep back and forth with the current exposing little creatures wandering or swimming about.  The colors are astounding.

The music is purely ethereal and relaxing.  There is no melody or song structure  just a calming digital musical canvass.  All the filming is done in the south and southwest pacific, sometimes using coral and parts of shipwrecks, tires or other man-made objects as reefs.  It has a continuous loop so it takes a while before you realize you are even in the looped stage as the beauty is so mesmerizing.

There is an optional commentary where a marine biologist shares his interesting information on the marine ecosystems.  A short Bonus Feature (Artificial Reefs) takes some of these man-made objects and beautifully shows how the aquatic life has taken advantage of it.

The fish, the reefs, the currents, the coral, the color and the large variety of sea-life mixed with the other-worldly music makes for a calming and nearly spiritual experience.  I've had fish tanks in my home and remember staring into them for hours watching just a couple of dozen fish.  This film on a large flat-screen makes you feel like you are there.  You may even want to get certified for SCUBA after this.  Film provided for review.",1393027200,8,1507,4.809338521400778
4924234,5,B00613U154,"This is a very vibrant and uniquely crafted journey through a variety of diverse coral and black sand landscapes.  The reef scenes are stunning and rich with marine life from some of the most remote corners of our planet.  I was especially engaged with and entertained by the marine biologist/cameraman's commentary on the habitat, fish behavior and what it took to capture the image.  This information gave me a much better appreciation for not only how privileged we are to see these microcosms of life but also how challenging it can be to capture natural moments without impacting or disturbing these creatures.  Who needs aquariums when I can experience an incredible underwater tour over and over in the comfort of my home?

There are several options for playback; choice between cameraman commentary or pleasant original music as well as the ability to set the playback to continuous.  In addition, there is a bonus featurette about artificial reefs - from cool WWII wrecks to modern day coral cultivation grids.

This production team has created two other titles in the Nature's Aquarium series.  I have all of them in my library as each provides a different point of view through the blue window of our planet.  All highly recommended!!",1389744000,4,1245,4.975845410628019
4924235,5,B00613U154,"Exceptional DVD! Really enjoy the various viewing options. As an educator, I especially like the scientific, but easy to understand narration which is perfect for divers, students, and anyone interested in learning about the many collaborative efforts that are necessary for the survival of marine life! Very well done! Highly Recommend~",1386460800,2,337,5.627450980392157

4924241,5,B00613U154,"I was never one to go to beaches let alone feel compelled to go scuba diving. This DVD ""hooked"" (no pun intended) me the moment it began. Everyone, including me, who was watched this video has become mesmerized by the brilliant colors, incredible variety of fish/reefs, and music. Be prepared to feel enveloped in a sense of calm as your drift with the ebb & flow of the water currents.",1438819200,3,386,4.5285714285714285

I would have like a little more variety from the different oceans.  It can be looped which I like.",1416614400,,260,3.980769230769231
4924249,5,B00613U154,"Just what I was looking for, for my big screen tvs.  I use them in the summer and have it loop to play continuously ---perfect when we entertain in the summer---so pretty! Plan to order his other underwater dvd . Sometimes we turn up the narration and enjoy hearing him explain what we are seeing--(cool Australian accent)

Also is a great thing to have playing on your tvs if you are showing your home to sell-----it totally creates a beautiful ambient mood!!!  You can choose the music to play with it or turn it down to enjoy only the scenes.",1411689600,3,545,4.43

4924251,5,B00613U154,"And after watching it with her, I think I'm going to get one for myself! She has always loved aquariums but she is just too busy to take care of one. This solved that for her! A 60"" HD aquarium without the expense & time! The HD looks great on her TV! She was very excited when she found out that it was on a loop. She doesn't have to stop what she's doing, such as quilting, to restart it after an hour. She enjoys the music & the commentary but prefers the natural sounds.  She hasn't ever been diving, so seeing all the various COLORFUL fish & creatures that live on the reefs & just under the surface has been fun for her!
I have traveled quite a bit to various places in the Caribbean & I have went scuba diving & snorkeled in some beautiful places. It doesn't quite replace that & it certainly makes me want to head south but it will hold me over until my next trip!
All in all, I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone that loves underwater sea life! The reefs are teeming with life & color! The videographer did a splendid job!",1406592000,,1042,4.158415841584159
4924252,5,B00613U154,This is exactly what we were looking for!  Love the vivid under water scenes and the auto loop feature is fantastic. Much better than a standard fish tank dvd,1398470400,,158,4.448275862068965
4924253,5,B00613U154,"This DVD is beautifully filmed. The HD picture quality is excellent. There is a lot of variety in the scenes, they are all peaceful and interesting. While watching the scenery you can listen to relaxation music or natural sounds or the cameraman's commentary. The commentary is casual but very informative, I learned a lot about coral reefs and fish.",1398124800,,350,4.9491525423728815
4924254,5,B00613U154,We love this DVD.  It's very calming.  We also love the commentary mode as well.  The mode where it has written text goes by too fast to be able to read the longer entries though.  BUT..we don't miss anything since the audio commentary says the same thing.,1397520000,,256,4.382978723404255
4924255,5,B00613U154,"This DVD incorporates a diverse array of fascinating underwater scenes which have been filmed, narrated and edited perfectly. The underwater videography is exceptional and must be some of the best available.

The optional commentary is a terrific learning tool in that it encapsulates a wealth of information on the marine science, conservation and videography aspects of the scenes - thoroughly enlightening.

Another 5 star DVD from Undersea Productions.",1393891200,,456,5.6911764705882355

8490748,5,B00613U154,"What can I say....WOW!  The video stands out, all by itself, but recently I turned on the ""titles"", thinking that it would just show the fish names, but ""No"", it is actually typed narration of what is going on in the scenery you are watching, by the person that filmed the clip, who just happens to be a marine biologist.  It adds an entire new dimension to what you are watching when you understand part of what is going on before your very eyes.

I bought this to watch while rowing, but it's fascinating just to sit and watch.  There are all sorts of unique marine life in this video, and the bonus track also shows ""Man made reefs"", such as sunken boats, or a bunch of tires tied together of all things.  Pretty cool stuff

I would whole heartedly recommend this video to anyone.",1493942400,5,783,4.36551724137931

After a long day......turn down the lights..... soft music.....pop this in your dvd player and a glass of your favorite drink. Oh!  ... your favorite chair you will be amazed!!!  And for the price compared to a large fish tank.....this DVD is a winner hands down!!",1471392000,2,433,4.443037974683544
8490752,2,B00613U154,"I agree that the music was very good; however, there is one scene where there are worm-like creatures bopping up and down which I absolutely hated. It didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the video. Hardly relaxing. I would hate to have that scene come up with company around. I'm sure people would think - what the heck is that? Unfortunately, I won't be able to use it when entertaining as I had hoped. In addition, some of the coloring seemed artificial. Overall, I was disappointed. I bought Reefscapes for my Mom, and I think it is a much better video.",1467590400,2,559,4.384615384615385
