7936214,5,B00005B1XH,"Growing up throughout the 50s & 60s and being a TV child I remember practically all that era's comedy shows. There were literally dozens of good comedians but only a few really greats that I want to see today. Red Skelton is one of them. His comedy is priceless and timeless. I consider myself fortunate to have found The ""Lost Episodes."" Furthermore, I was doubly blessed. I found it at X-CLUSIVE MEDIA via Amazon and I couldn't have expected better service receiving the disc quickly and in excellent shape. A third blessing was the price. I couldn't believe how reasonable it was. If you should ever find a copy of Lost Episodes, I suggest you grab it quickly. The comedy is truly original. God bless you Red. Rest on peace. You will always be one of the greats.",1390694400,,765,4.550724637681159

More great moments with Red's famous characters - Freddy the Freeloader, Clem Kadiddlehopper, George Appleby and others!  This sensational compliation of scenes that have gone unseen for over 30 years features TV's king of laugher in unforgettable sketches, clips and bits!  You'll see Red popping off flashbulbs in a photo store to see if any are good!  His funny opening monologue is accented by his comically expressive eyes, smile and hand gestures.  Then watch as Clem Kadiddlehopper convinces a 1960 Census taker (Artie Johnson of Laugh-In fame) that his father is 185 years old.  The pun-filled fountain of youth spoof soon moves to Hollywood.  There, an aging star (Audrey Meadows of The Honemooners) takes years off her life with Clem's mudpack.  From a 1959 show, Freddy the Freeloader makes a Cold War joke about an egg before befriending an inventor (Richard Deacon) being chased by spies.  You'll love the Murphy bed that Red's friend Alfred (Edward Everett Horton) must sleep in.  When Red was sick in 1961, other commedians filled in, and you'll see Wayne & Shuster with Ed Sullivan demonstrating his rarely seen comedic talents as he plays Clem dealing with two hucksters, then Deadeye with locked spurs, and Freddy with two inspectors.  Red's seen in some exceptional pantomime performances before the United Nations in 1960.  As George Appleby, Red appears in a large, economy-size skit from 1962, before encountering a poor excuse for a guardian angel (Harpo Marx).  Even the crew plays tricks on Red in this one!  Finally you'll see Jack Benny making a special presentation for Red's 12th fun-packed year on TV!  Video is in Black and White and runs approximately 70 minutes.  Compliation produced by Film Shows Inc and complied by Sandy Oliveri.",1155254400,2,1807,5.074576271186441

Vincent Price clearly steals the scene in his portion, playing an actor who needs to get in shape to appeal to his girlfriend. Price enlists the help of Red's Cauliflower McPugg character. in another segment, Red is George Appleby and the skit revolves around him being the star witness in a crime. Another skit has Red as Clem Kadiddlehopper meeting up with Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae. Freddy the Freeloader closes the comedy portion of the ""Volume One"" tape in a skit with Frank Lovejoy. In ""Volume Two"" we see Red as the same characters but in different stories. Ed Sullivan is shown in rare clips playing Red's characters {Red was sick during one season and had to be filled in for}. Audrey Meadows plays an aging actress helped to remain young via Clem's fountain of youth serum. Deadeye is captured by indians and in the spirit of live TV and Red's famed ad-libbing, the skit ends in a blooper. some of Red's pantomime skills are showcased too when he did a UN concert. Freddy the Freeloader's sketch deals with Edward Everett Horton trying to steal a little black box that Richard Deacan (prior to his role on Dick Van Dyke) asked Freddy to guard but not to open. George Appleby's skit involves Harpo Marx being a guardian angel with typical results. the last segment involves the cameo appearance by Jack Benny from 1962. Both lost episode volumes are excellant...however, Red is of an acquired taste. Low-brow, knock-about comedy isn't for everyone.",1076112000,4,1587,4.774545454545454
7936219,2,B00005B1XH,"I remember watching the Red Skelton show when I was a kid and I suppose I was simply hoping to see re-runs. This DVD is inexpensive and you get about what you pay for. The quality is low. In one respect, we can expect that since video recording at the time of the original airing was primitive. Meanwhile, the DVD looks like it was put together using equally primitive techniques. Unless you take control and skip around, you will have to see snippets of the same scenes over and over. The way the main content is edited, I don't think we really get a feel for the way the show really came off on live TV. In the midsts of the skits, monologues and other material in the show, Red was carrying on a tangental dialog with the audience that is only glimpsed in the 'best of' editing. I would rather see whole episodes, warts and all, versus stilted snippets.",1049932800,26,856,4.35625
