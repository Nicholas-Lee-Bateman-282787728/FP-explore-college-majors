8315066,1,B000E1ZJCO,"As I live and teach in Ecuador, I bought this video hoping to use it in my cultural anthropology classes.  Unfortunately there was very little information about the culture and customs of the indigenous people.  It was more of an introduction to some of the cities in Ecuador and Peru and some of the crafts that the indigenous people make. The footage is ancient (from the 60's I think) and amateurish (much was shot by a shaking hand or by holding a camera out a window while riding in a car).  Also the information presented was severely outdated and irrelevant. I don't understand how the release date come have been listed as 2006.  In my opinion it should be listed as 1966. I feel this video was misrepresented as a documentary and I would be ashamed to show it to a kindergarten class here in Ecuador.",1225411200,,809,4.52054794520548
