8182545,4,B000O176Y8,"I did not see all of the video but I know my daughter enjoys it. She loves alphabet themed books and videos. All the alphabet appears in the first story. I'm not a fan of Seth Green or Robot Chicken. He keeps a clean mouth with no sexual innuendo. But he looks like he just got up from a hangover. The first story; Telly subscribes to an alphabet delivery service. Seth starts delivering letters while Alan tries to get Hooper's ready for a party of penguins. Big Bird gets stuck in a running gag. My daughter would love to get the special gift Telly gets at the end of the story. The video is a recording of a episode of Sesame Street so the rest of the video has the rest of the show, number of the day with the Count, letter of the day to Cookie Monster, etc. My daughter wore out her first copy. I had to order a replacement.",1420848000,,829,4.1234567901234565

8182548,5,B000O176Y8,My son is going through the ABC phase. he is addicted so this movie was great for him. Also Seth Green is in this one and who doesn't love Seth Green? Come on he is too funny. Great movie and the length is nice not too long not too short.,1375228800,,238,3.78
8182549,4,B000O176Y8,"This is basically an episode of Sesame Street.  It is fine, but I could just record & save the Sesame Street.  Of course this has the advantage of being portable for viewing in the car or wherever.",1361059200,,197,4.297297297297297
8182550,5,B000O176Y8,"and we send her these tapes that our kids watched when they were little. she loves them and is absorbing so much. We love the old videos from the 70's the best...They don't have these in England so we send them. My daughter has such good memories of these times and was sooo smart, thanks to Sesame Street!",1221264000,,306,4.293103448275862
