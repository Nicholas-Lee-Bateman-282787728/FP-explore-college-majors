8145498,4,B000IHXBVK,"Russ Meyer's ""Pandora Peaks"" gets a bad rap, but it is a fitting final film celebrating all the sexy things Meyer celebrated. While there is no story, there is wit and self-parody. ""Pandora Peaks"" is a remake or a redo of his wistful ""Mondo Topless"" in the 1960s complete with tape recorders. I don't share Meyer's predilections, but I find a lot of things to enjoy in his films and I find them in ""Pandora Peaks"".
Perhaps ""Pandora Peaks"" is his Warhol film. You can come and go as you please. Leave it playing and check it out as you go about your household chores.
""Finders Keepers Losers Weepers"", which I had not seen before, is probably more conventional and straight than his official straight films, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" and ""The Seven Minutes"". Could have been better with humour, but still a good B grade thriller to pass the time away.",1278374400,,857,4.571428571428571
