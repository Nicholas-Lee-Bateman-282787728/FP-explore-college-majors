8230150,5,B000XXWKGQ,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of seller who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,553,4.266666666666667
