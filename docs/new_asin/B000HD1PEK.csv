Over half the movie is stupid training shots - climbing walls, jogging, etc. One plot twist is completely implausible (involving contents of cargo). A ragtag bunch of kids takes on Hezbollah? Please.

This is an embarrassment to all Christian movie-makers anywhere. To those who gave it good reviews - you are doing everyone a grave disservice. If you really enjoyed it, OK, otherwise, I'd consider it deceitful.",1286064000,,504,5.2875
8138639,1,B000HD1PEK,"(warning, I had to rate this at one star to post this review, the option for zero or negative stars was not available)

Another movie that left me wanting a refund or a freaking reset button!  I mean if you want a heavy handed independent movie that reinforces your values, this is your movie.  If the meaning of hard core movie fest in your man cave is Tammy Fae Singing in the background during bathroom breaks of Barney tapes with the kids, this is your movie.  If your dream vacation is waiting in hours to see christmas lights at James Bakers old land, then again, this is your movie.

If not, THEN DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!",1193788800,,637,4.410256410256411
8138640,1,B000HD1PEK,"My wife and I downloaded this film thinking it sounded somewhat intriguing.  However, I now regret doing so, and I have apologized to my wife for wasting our time.  There is no character development whatsoever, almost no plot, long sequences that add nothing to the film, and a horrible soundtrack that constantly plays (with music that usually does not fit in any way with what is happening on screen).  On top of all this, the ""faith"" aspect of the film is very superfical and unrealistic.  There were several times I thought to just turn it off, but we persevered to the end.  We really wanted to like it, but Squad 77 did not deliver.  I think you will enjoy this film only if you were part of the cast or crew or are among their relatives and friends.  Otherwise, I recommend avoiding it.",1175731200,,793,4.503496503496503
8138641,5,B000HD1PEK,"Of course I will give this a great review! I had to check out the amazon download thing and it works great! The movie is exciting, fast paced, and the best indie action/adventure you will find!",1173916800,,193,4.388888888888889
8138642,4,B000HD1PEK,"If morality and message is what you look for in a movie, this one will leave you feeling satisfied!

The movie is fast paced and carries an sense of tension, but it is filmed in such a way that is not going to scare the wits out of you!

Through out the story you will see lives changed as the young people become serious about their mission. What is the mission? To help missionaries in a hostile country get their supplies.

This movie will leave a lasting impression on your children. My kids (6-13) all watched the movie with me and my two boys played it again as soon as it was over.",1172102400,2,588,4.185840707964601
