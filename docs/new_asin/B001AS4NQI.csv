It is important to see critical thinking in action. The Rocky Mountain Institute thinks and acts long-term, ""least cost, end use,"" in contrast to media and politics that only thinks and acts short-term ""least cost, first use."" I have other Charlie Rose DVDs and all are good quality.",1225324800,,429,4.972222222222222
8279346,5,B001AS4NQI,"This is scary. Two expert business journalists, Morgenson from the NY Times and Sloan from Fortune take a look at present credit, mortgage crises. In doing so they give a picture of the American economic system in very deep trouble. They say Americans have lived beyond their means for forty years and now the time has come to pay for it. They point to the increasing American dependency of foreign capital , and the fact that this reverses traditional roles, with others chiding the U.S. and telling it what to do, instead of wealthy America telling others what they need. Sloan calls it the Golden Rule. ' He who has the gold tells the other what to do'. Lack of prudence, irresponsibility is credited to a wide - range of actors in the economy, including private and public sector people and institutions. Morgenson says one reason it is difficult to see the way out of this is that no one seems to have 'the cards' to do this. Charlie Rose asks if now is the time to raise interest rates, and the answer is given that Inflation is now rearing its head and that will push this up even more. The picture given by Sloan is a colorful one of a kind of street football game in which everyone is sort of trying to do something without anyone having a grasp of what is going on over all. Charlie Rose asks a couple of times the question of whether this can be a total collapse of the system. Sloan says that it probably will not go that far, but sees it as all very bad. Morgenson says the Depression word is being heard more frequently. She says we are in the middle of the fifth inning perhaps in regard to the Credit and Mortgage crisis. ""But the only problem is that it is a double- header'. Both cite the stock market and debt- market as things to watch. Stocks are at their 2005 level.
There is the feeling that this is the biggest financial crisis since the Depression.
There was no mention of the economic policy of either McCain or Obama and the likelihood of either having a real sense of how to get America out of this.",1216166400,,2027,4.365079365079365
