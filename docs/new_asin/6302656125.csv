497899,5,6302656125,Of Mice and Men is one of my all-time favorite books.  It has always amazed me that such a short story has so much power to evoke raw emotions.  I guess that we are all touched by loneliness.  The movie adaptation  captures much of the power of the book.,942710400,7,254,4.122448979591836
497900,4,6302656125,"There's much to be said for Gary Sinise's adaptation of Steinbeck's 1937 classic, OF MICE AND MEN.  In many ways, it's a better film than the 1939 United Artist's version (currently available on DVD).
Part of the reason  for this is the frankness; Steinbeck's language has finally been loosed  from the Breen Office.  Too, the mature themes inherent in the novel are  allowed full play on the screen--the sexual tensions between Steinbeck's  bindle-stiffs and Curley's wife are palpable without being  pornographic.
And let it be said right here that Gary Sinise can act  rings around Burgess Meredith in the central role of George.  It is  unlikely anyone will ever nail the part so perfectly again.  These elements  alone make the film worth seeing.
For Steinbeck purists, however, some  things are lacking...particularly in the area of characterization.  For all  his effort, Malkovich isn't quite convincing as the giant Lennie, lapsing  into unfortunate Dracula-like hand-flutters in crucial scenes.  He also  tends to underplay and swallow important lines as if thinking, ""Hell,  everyone's read this book in high school, so let's get on with  it.""
Supporting characters suffer in some cases as well.  While Ray  Walston is quite good as Candy, changes in some of Steinbeck's other  characters are ill-conceived.  Curley's wife--in her late teens in the  novel, and quite harsh--is played as a sympathetic twenty-something by the  beautiful but too-polished Sherilynn Fenn.  The aged, handicapped  African-American Crooks is conversely played by an actor much too young,  and a crucial scene between the two in the book (where she threatens to  frame him for rape) is completely absent here.  The idea seems to be to  drum up sympathy for Fenn's character before her tragic death; this may be  politically correct, but it's poor Steinbeck...and senseless manipulation  in a film that otherwise catches Steinbeck's point of view so well.
Sad  to say, some crucial scenes are misdirected.  The central fight between  Lennie and Curley, perfectly realized in the '39 version, is slow and drawn  out here; and is there really any need for the final slow-motion buddy shot  of Lennie and George walking in the field at the end?  These are startling  stylistic lapses in an otherwise tightly-controlled artistic grip.
And  yet, in spite of these major flaws, the film has power.  The sets, the  cimematography, and (outside of the fight scene), the editing are perfectly  done, as is the understated musical score.  In short, Sinise has given us a  very worthy version of the Steinbeck tale; a version that's the best one  available in many ways.",917481600,28,2646,5.144208037825059
497901,5,6302656125,"Everyone seems to focus on the ending of this movie, but there is so much more to it.  Malkovich plays Lennie believably and poignantly infusing humor and understanding into his character.  Sinise is to be commended not  only for his portrayal of George, but also for his direction.  The colors  are warm and the camera angles create an immediacy which draw in the  viewer.  Sinise and Foote's screenplay are faithful to Steinbeck, but they  don't let their reverence get in the way of telling a great story.",916876800,,508,4.758620689655173

498071,5,6302656125,"I happened to watch ""Of Mice and Men"" the day after viewing ""Manchester at the sea."" There are similarities and enormous differences. Of Mice and Men"" is about two migrant workers. One is feeble-minded, played by John Malkovich and the other who watches over him and tries to keep him out of trouble is a friendly smart fellow played by Gary Sinise who wrote the screen play and directed the film. I read John Steinbeck's novel over sixty years ago and only remember that I liked it a lot: the writing and what it taught me about migrant workers, but I do not remember it enough to compare the book and film. Suffice it to say that I also enjoyed the film, very much.
The film begins when the two migrants are running away from a large number of men and dogs. We later learn that Lenny, the feeble-minded very strong man, had frightened a woman and the men were chasing after him to hurt him. His friend found him, showed him a place where he could hide if he got into trouble again, and saved him. This opening event foreshadows the end of the film. There is another event in the middle of the movie of an old man and his dog, which also foreshadows later events. I mention this to highlight my view that Of Mice and Men was written very well, unlike Manchester of the Sea that moves from one depressing scene to the next, with no let up.
I was greatly impressed by the acting of John Malkovich who unlike the main actor in Manchester was able to reflect many different emotions, while the Manchester actor only showed depression.
Both films are enormously sad, but while Manchester only showed unending depression, Mice had much else, even several heart-warming scenes. True it was sad to see how feeble Lenny was and how he could not understand what was said to him on many occasions, yet it did not sink to the level of depression. If I could vote, I would give Mice an academy Award for Best Picture and Malkovich the award for Best Actor.",1494460800,,1944,4.432960893854749

498112,1,6302656125,"Only watched part of the movie and refused to watch the rest.  The dialog of a supposedly retarded (or must I say mentally challenged) person was unbelievable.  He used complex, multi-part sentences that a challenged person would never have used .  Few of his expression or reactions were true to life and a scrawny man in padding could not or did not move anything like a hulking challenged man.  Have the writers or Malkovich ever talk to or observed a challenged person before or have their lives been too sheltered?  When Lenny picked up the playing card and without even rotating it proclaimed that both ends were the same I almost puked.  Even a challenged person first discovering something like that would show surprise or pride in their observation or something but Malkovich showed nothing.
  Another thing that bothered me was  the on-again, off-again southern accents.  If you can't speak in an authentic accent don't try.
  Steinbeck's novel is an great, important, and touching story of the depression.  Much of the acting in thus movie was great but I think everything about Lenny, one of a main characters,  made this movie unwatchable.  That includes dialog, casting, and acting and directing.",1489795200,,1210,4.98

My 10th grade students loved this novel and enjoyed watching the movie version just as much as they did reading the text. My students were charged with comparing/contrasting the versions so they could discuss as a whole group. There were so many underlying themes and they were able to grasp all of them. I especially appreciated their interests in the subject matter because some students maturity levels would conflict with the language. The text was inundated with the terms of the time, but it certainly didn't distract the overall message. I simply addressed the time period prior to beginning the reading.

It also appeared like George simply murdered Lenny, so how could he not get in trouble with the law?  In the book, the huntin' party came up on George after shooting Lenny, and the men assumed Lenny had stolen one of the men's guns and George had to wrestle it off of him and shoot him in self defense.  Everyone knew how crazy and strong Lenny was, so in the book, George would have been cleared.  The movie left the question, how George could have gotten away with simply executing Lenny.  Of course, George could have explained it as self defense, but the movie left no hint of that.",1455926400,,842,4.422077922077922

498493,5,6302656125,"Of Mice and Men is the 1992 adaptation of John Steinbecks 1937 novel set in the bleak world of itinerant men during the Great Depression. George (Gary Sinise) is a small, quick-witted man with no family and no money. His traveling companion, Lennie (John Malkovich), is a large man with the mind of a child and the strength of an ox. They have jobs lined up at a farm near Soledad, in the California countryside, where acres of wheat need harvesting.

Soon after they start work, the farm bosss son, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), starts picking on Lennie and before long Curleys lonely wife (Sherilyn Fenn) begins hanging around the bunkhouse and barn, with an eye for George. Lennies innocent simplemindedness combined with his brute strength lead to a terrible accident, and Lennie looks to George to find a way out of a situation that spirals into tragedy.

Sinise, who serves double duty as director, is exceptional as George, providing his character with a balance of bitterness, resentment, and hope for better times ahead. This is a subtle but thoroughly engaging performance.

Malkovich is not the giant of a man Steinbeck describes, but his slurred speech, distant look, slightly crossed eyes, and lumbering gait add up to a convincing Lennie.

This screen adaptation by Horton Foote (The Trip to Bountiful) is photographed by Kenneth MacMillan in hues of gold and earth tones. Production designer David Gropman evocatively recreates the era with period vehicles, costumes, and set design that suggest a bygone time.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include commentary with director Gary Sinise; conversation with director and screenwriter; making-of featurette; deleted scenes; make-up tests; Sherilyn Fenns screen test; and theatrical trailer.",1453420800,,1754,5.227758007117438

498517,5,6302656125,Classic movie.,1451779200,,14,6.5
498518,5,6302656125,"Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel and released in 1992, the story focuses on two traveling companions desperate for work in rural California during the Depression: George (Gary Sinise) is of average stature and smart whereas Lennie (John Malkovich) is big and mentally challenged.  They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), and his flirtatious wife (Sherilyn Fenn) complicate matters. John Terry is on hand as Slim, Ray Walston plays Candy and Joe Morton plays Crooks.

Ive been a fan of this potent Western drama/tragedy ever since I read the book as a teenager and both this version and the 1992 version are worthy film adaptions (I have yet to see the 1981 TV production with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, which Ive heard is good). It seems that you just cannot do a bad ""Of Mice and Men,"" as long as you have decent actors and filmmakers.

Some people scoff at the moral of the story, as if it all comes down to shooting your aged, useless dog yourself, but its way more than this. Its a commentary on the nature of companionship and loneliness: Whereas George and Lennie compliment each other many of the other characters languish in isolation, like Candy, Curleys wife and Crooks, even Slim. Questions of strength, weakness, usefulness, reality and utopia are explored as the story leaves you scratching your head.

Comparing the two versions, I slightly prefer the newer rendition because its in color and is just overall better made with a superior score and cast with the exception of Lon Chaney as Lennie. Malkovich is very effective in the more recent version, but Chaneys Lennie is just more likable. While I don't like the addition of cussing in the 1992 rendition, its probably more realistic and it isn't so bad that it makes the movie unwatchable (for me anyway). In any case, Sherilyn Fenn is a vast improvement over the originals Betty Field, whos annoying and not desirable enough to pull off the part (but, then again, she might be desirable to male ranch hands with no other females within a dozen miles).

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California.

GRADE: A-

COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless you know the story)

Curley's wife has only ever been valued for her sexuality, which she has learned to use to attract attention. Not only is she the only female character, shes also the only character not to be given a name in the book and the 1992 version, which emphasizes that shes a sexual plaything, currently owned by Curley. She was repressed by her mother and taken advantage of by men who made her empty promises. She prefers to believe that her mother stole her letters from the ""Hollywood"" man who used her, instead of accepting reality. She is married to a boor who places little value on her and so she seeks the only attention she can get from the men on the ranch as the only woman there: sexual attention. The contact with Lennie in the barn is as far as sexual as it gets. When she says ""It feels good"" to have her hair stroked, she isn't speaking sexually. She is enjoying the only nonsexual attention and affectionate touch she has had in a very long time, if ever. It is almost a meeting of children between this woman who long ago lost her sexual innocence but remains hopelessly nave, and Lennie, who also longs for soft things in his life. It is a beautiful, tragic scene.

Someone argued that Curleys wife wanted to get Lennie on her side so that he would kill Curley and she would be free to leave. If Lennie killed him, no one would believe him if he ever said that she told him to do it; and since she didn't do the deed herself, she could easily leave and start her life over, hopefully as a movie star. While an interesting theory, the young woman doesn't come across this devious or cunning in the story where her actions are more natural and nave. Similar to Lennie, she was a child in an adult body, albeit not mentally challenged. She was starving for companionship, but none of the other men would hang out with her due to Curley and the threat of losing their job. Lennie was alone in the barn and so she just took advantage of the occasion to converse with someone. Add to this the fact that Lennie was the only man on the ranch to humble (conquer) her arrogant SOB husband, whom she hated. Plus, she noticed earlier how Lennie appraised her with obvious awe. So there was a subconscious attraction and she wanted the gentle giant to touch her, stroke her hair; perhaps to ""reward"" him.",1451606400,,4633,4.606060606060606

I teach American History in high school. I try to bring the era under study to life for my students through the use of films that reflect the era. I chose ""Of Mice and Men"" for the Depression Era. The film reflects the struggles individuals face trying to survive. It also touches on the positive and negative aspects of individuals in conflict.
There is also the added benefit that the film affords cross curriculum learning opportunities to tie in with English Literature, English Language Arts when I ask for extended response answers during tests. It provides the opportunity for higher level thinking skills to connect the characters to individual traits and exploration of individual motivation for behaviors.
Having said all of the above, my students enjoyed this film and went home to share the film with their families. Several parents contacted me with praise for engaging their children where before they were ambivalent about learning history. It's a win!",1448928000,7,996,5.079268292682927

498864,5,6302656125,"I first started to read Steinbeck's novels in the summer of 1955 with ""Cannery Row"",followed by ""Sweet Thursday.""I was mesmerized by these two novels and it didn't take me long to search out Steinbeck's other novels and read them all within a year or two. By the way,in school,in Canada,Steinbeck or even Mark Twain was never part of the curriculum. We were exposed only to English  or British Literature. For some reason,""Cannery Row"" was my favorite;probably because it was my first Steinbeck novel..At about the same time,I read ""God's Little Acre"" by Erskine Caldwell and in a few years found and read all of his novels. Steinbeck and Caldwell are still my favorite writers. While Steinbeck has been recognized as one of America's greatest writers,Caldwell has tended to be eclipsed by the literary establishment. I used to get a kick out of going in a used bookstore and asking a  clerk if they had anything by Erskine Caldwell and have them reply,""Yes,of course,but I think you mean Taylor Caldwell"". You'd never get a response like that asking for Steinbeck.
Of Mice and Men"",  ""Grapes of Wrath"" and ""East Of Eden"" ,I would guess,are probably the best known and loved of Steinbeck's many novels. However;for some reason,""Of Mice And Ment was not my favorite, and I don't really know why. I had never seen a movie version;but recently came across this VHS ,so I thought it was time time revisit it again.
 I found it was excellent and I enjoyed it much more than I even expected.
 A lot of people will contend that a book is better than a movie .I tend to disagree  and find ""a picture is better than a thousand words"".I guess ,it is for that reason,that I have never searched out and read the book after watching the movie. The sounds,scenery,expressions,and all the elements that can be employed in a movie add so much to the original book.
So,if you are a Steinbeck fan and have read ""Of Mice And Men"",treat yourself to this movie version. You may be surprised as I was.
 The sound and picture quality of this VHS ,released in 1992, is excellent and has a running time of I Hour and 50 minutes.",1419033600,,2103,4.652291105121294

In this movie he plays Lennie, a dimwitted ""man child"" who is being looked after, in a sense, by Gary Sinise's Character George.

Normally I don't care about those kinds of interpretations between movies and books, but the script of the movie was basically taken directly from the book. It's hard to watch something that is almost word for word, action for action, what you read, but the characters don't match what you read.",1385164800,,475,4.3977272727272725

Especially after the whole ""I know what happened to your face"" scene. He would not have just told Lenny - he would have told Curly's wife to ""stay away"". Like I said - it's a mild criticism, and only because an actress who slightly understated the role would have represented a more vulnerable danger, rather than an obvious one.

The locations were wonderful and that, coupled with the costumes, drew me in to the era being portrayed. Having read the book I was aware of the ending and yet it was still powerful and moving, a sign of a top film. I even found myself making links I hadn't previously considered as I watched this for the first time. Sinise has pulled off a masterly adaptation of the book and this comes highly recommended indeed.

499797,2,6302656125,"This is an enjoyable film, but it doesn't accurately retell the novel, nor does it capture the atmosphere of the novel, which is darker. Nor does the location come close to what the Salinas Valley and Soledad look like.

The main objections I had, aside from location, which I will address further on, were casting and interpretation.  Malkovich, who back when this film was made still was a fine actor (he's since slipped into a parody of his own acting style), is simply not big enough to make a credile Lennie, is too old, and overemphasizes the humor of the character.  There is an element of pathos that is totally missing.  Likewise Sinise is too tall for George, too good looking and kind - too much a Hollwood actor, or more acurately Chicago's idea of what a Californian is. George is more of a tough guy, a small scrappy man.

The biggest problem is Curley's wife - I do not know whether it was out of some misguided PC sensibility or what but the attempt to humanize her misfires and skews the balance of the story.  She is supposed to be a loose woman, more dangerous, and the added dialogue and scenes throw too much balance over towards her - and why?  She isn't the center of focus, and it takes away from the harsh reality of this story set during the Great Depression. She should be more of a femme fatale, not the nice misunderstood bored house wife.

If they had used the real Salinas area - and if it is too urbanized there are plenty of areas south near Soledad or Greenfield - that would have been better.  The Santa Ynez Valley is too mountainous - the Big Sur and Gabilan ranges are more gentle.  The farm was too often bathed in golden mountain sunlight.  Most of the farms near Salinas are not far from the ocean, so the climate is damper.

The beginning of the film is all wrong - the dramatic posse chasing Lennie and George out of Weed - very Hollywood, and the setting for Weed (near Mount Shasta) is way off.  The ending without Carlson, Curley and Slim entering to find a dead Lennie is all wrong.

499800,5,6302656125,"Of Mice and Men is a exquistely beautiful adaptation of Steinbeck's novel.  This bittersweet relationship of two Depression era farmhands is superb.  Gary Sinese directs and co-stars with John Malkovich as the friends who are migrant workers with a cherished dream of a small home of their own.  They are tired of being serfs and look forward to better times.

The setting is California during the Depression and Lennie (John Malkovich) is running away from trouble with his best and only friend George (Gary Sinese).  They catch a train and ride to another town and get a ranch job.  Lennie is mentally-retarded and a tall, strong man not aware of his own strength.  He kills small animals with kindness and handles them too roughly. George is constantly reminding Lennie not to get in trouble and not to talk to people.

George and Lennie do well on this new job and learn they can buy a farm together with an older farmhand who has saved some money.  He is desperate to spend his last years in dignity and offers to help buy the property so he can be part of the dream of owning a place.  Things are looking up for the three men.

It is the best of times for awhile, but the Rancher's daughter-in-law is lonely and is constantly trying to find time alone with either Lennie or George.  Lennie accidently strangles the needy seductive young woman and realizes he has done something really bad.  Lennie runs to a secret meeting place and waits for George as the rancher's son sets out with ranch helpers and the dogs to hunt Lennie down.

Of Mice and Men is moving, clear and shows deep understanding of Steinbeck's tale.",1272931200,,1622,4.606271777003484

George and Lenny go to a ranch to work, they are migrant workers. The scenes suggest the 1930s. Lenny has a problem, George looks after him. The bus driver shows malicious behavior to these strangers, a comment on human nature. Lenny drinks from a stream like an animal. [Symbolism?] Lenny wants what they don't have. George has heavy responsibilities. [Is there a hidden message here?] George has plans of buying a house and land where they can live a settled life. He says Lenny is his cousin and takes care of him. The boss' son throws his status around. Curly's wife flaunts herself; is she trouble?

We see a thrashing machine separating wheat from chaff. [Symbolism?] These machines also migrate from farm to farm. The bags of grain are loaded onto horse-drawn wagons. Curly's wife seems lonely and talks to the hired help. Candy has an old dog, lame and toothless. Is it better off dead? [An omen for this story?] Candy had this dog a long time. Curly misses his wife and searches among the hired hands. Candy offers to go in with George and Lenny to buy that farm; he is worried about his future. Curly picks a fight with Lenny and suffers. But he won't retaliate against George and Lenny. The men go into town for the Saturday, Lenny stays behind. The cook is lonely too. Curly's wife is alone and lonely. She wanders into the barn and finds the lifeless pup. What kind of harm can she do? She also had dreams for her future. Will Lenny stroke her soft hair? Will something go terribly wrong? Will Lenny seek refuge in that secret place? Candy enters the barn then tells George about the accident. ""What we gonna do now, George?"" The men form a gang to go after Lenny. George will go to find Lenny. Does Lenny remember what happened? Then George tells Lenny the story about the farm. Will Lenny go to a far better world that he has ever known before?

This story seems trivial on the surface. Is it a comment on the migrant workers who have no real home? Was it a subtle story about the bond between two men? Does it show how economic conditions affect the lives of ordinary people? You can compare it to the more restrained version from the 1930s and decide which was better. Was the book better than the film? You can see the care taken to make the details authentic. But an isolated farm would not have electricity in those days, kerosene lanterns would be used at night.

The screenplay by Horton Foote is deeply moving.  All of the actors are first rate.  Malkovich is quite impressive, never going too far over the line which would be easy to do in such a role.  Sinese is very good, too, in a moving performance.  (I'm running out of superlatives.) All of the supporting actors and the actress give fine performances.

The setting is really beautiful-- the sunny California farm area, which helps to balance the darkness of the tale.  The happier details of their work life--reaping the barley and the horseshoe game, give some notion of the joy of life  even while you feel the sense of impending tragedy building up.  It's all done very well.

The lighting, the direction, the acting all absorb the viewer and you are there in that room, with others whose lives have been broken down beyond salvage, and for a moment you can feel the spark of hope that such a person may feel when they begin to think they may have ""one more chance"" at something of value in life.

499855,5,6302656125,"5 STARS FROM THE GIT-GO!

This 1992 adaptation of John Steinbeck's Depression Era novel is as solid a film as solid can be. From the very opening of the film, we see cousins George and Lenny running and a woman in a ripped red dress screaming for help. We are alerted from the start where this story is going. The thing is, we don't want it to go there,but it will;it is inevitable. So sit back and you will NOT relax because the tension is palpable and the result will come. Now that is a very different take from many films today in that you will be surprised by outcomes and all the twists and turns;but not so in this amazing Gary Sinise directed-Horton Foote scripted tale of two men who must come to their fate.

Gary Sinise is the tough but tender George who has always looked after the dim-witted but lovable Lenny. It is obvious early on that George has considered Lenny a millstone around his neck;but there is a genuine love there for him despite that. Lenny (the best John Malkovich other than DANGEROUS LIAISONS) is the clumsy,oafish ""gentle giant"" who caresses  things too tightly often killing them unintentionally. Their relationship is played out among the migrant working men of the Tyler Ranch,California. Curly (Casey Siemaszko) is boss's ""short"" tyrant of a son who beats and neglects his wife (Sherilynn Fenn) and has a Napoleonic complex that sets him squarely against the giant innocent Lenny. The wife is always hanging about all the men. She is desperately lonely. She spells trouble from the start. Sinise takes us very deliberately through each scene,allowing each character to develop just enough, only to bring them to their ultimate reckoning.

There is not one false note,one false step in this film;it is seamless in it's direction and flawless in the screenplay and acting. It is tough and tender and forceful. I cannot recommend a film more highly.

Mark Isham provides a beautiful Aaron Copelandesque Americana soundtrack.

Great companion films would be DOMINICK AND EUGENE and FRANKENSTEIN (believe it or not) and INFAMOUS for the misunderstood ""gentle giant"" feebleminded character. SEABISCUIT is a great film for the Depression-Era angle.",1187049600,,2178,4.920980926430517
499876,5,6302656125,"It's risky business whenever a classic piece of American literature is adapted to film (especially when it already was years before to boot), but somehow everyone involved here managed to pull it off.  John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is brilliantly adapted here and directed by Gary Sinise.  Sinise also stars as George, and John Malkovich is sublimely cast as George's retarded, hulkish cousin Lennie.  The two drifters appear to finally find a home to call their own, and a dreamish future that is closer to ever than happening, only to have everything tragically fall apart.  What makes this 1992 adaptation of Steinbeck's classic so great is Sinise's sensitive direction as well as his strong and understated performance, but it's John Malkovich who steals the show in one of his career best performances as the sympathetic Lennie who is trying to survive in a world he was never meant for.  The DVD itself has some nice extras as well, including an insightful commentary from Sinise and screen tests for some of the actors.

499878,4,6302656125,"John Steinbeck's classic novel, ""Of Mice and Men,"" is given its finest treatment yet in this version starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as his mentally retarded pal, Lennie.

First filmed by Lewis Milestone in a 1939 version produced by Hal Roach with Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr. in the leads, this depression era saga of two migrant workers who dream of owning a piece of land on which the feeble-minded Lennie will ""tend the rabbits,"" continues to endure, having been remade earlier in TV versions with George Segal and Nicol Williamson in the late `60s, then again with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid in 1981.

The tragic tale is well-told in this rendition scripted by Horton Foote and directed by star Sinise. The performances are exceptional, although Malkovich does, at times, appear to be ""acting."" Perhaps he's too bright to be completely convincing as an imbecile. Regardless, if he isn't quite perfect, he's still very good. Ditto Sinise, Ray Walston, and the rest of the cast.

499880,5,6302656125,"I've been reading ""Of Mice and Men"" for a class I'm in and even though I've liked what I've read of the book (I haven't even reached Chapter 3), I didn't have an overwhelming desire to see the movie. That was until I found out one of my favorite actors John Malkovich is in it. I went out and got it the day I heard that information. As I said, I've only read 1 1/2 chapters; So I don't know how faithful it is to the book, but the first few minutes were pretty faithful. Having said that, this review is for the movie and is based on the movie and nothing more. The movie is directed by Gary Sinise, with a script by two-time Oscar winning screenwriter Horton Foote; A screenwriter who had already penned a screenplay based on a great American novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Since ""Of Mice and Men"" is considered one of the great American novels and it's author (John Steinbeck) one of the great American novelists, it's no doubt a daunting task to write the script. The film, however, is a complete cinematic triumph. The casting here is absolutely perfect. Sinise (an actor I pictured while reading the book) plays George and Malkovich plays Lennie. One of the things I love about Malkovich is his voice and I tend to hate it when he changes it to fit a character or an accent (i.e., Shadow of the Vampire). Here, I didn't mind it. In fact, I think it's one of Malkovich's best performances. George is a short, rough-around-the-edges kind of guy that is smart and hardworking, while Lennie is a hulking giant of a man with a good heart and the personality and wit of a baby. Both men are Depression-era workers, who are unable to hold a job because of Lennie's misgivings. They had a job in Weed, but were forced to flee when Lennie scared a woman by grabbing a hold of her dress (he liked the color). They arrive at the Tyler Ranch, with dreams of one day buying a house with a couple of acres and room for animals. Lennie will be able to tend to rabbits. Whenever George tells this story to Lennie, we see him happy. In fact, the only time George seems happy is when he's telling this story. At the farm, things go both ways for the fellas. They make some friends, like Candy (Ray Walston, in a great performance far away from Mr. Hand) and Slim (John Terry); But they also have to put up with the sadistic son-of-the-boss Curley (Casey Siemaszko). Worse yet, they have to put up with his unhappy and lonely wife (Sherilyn Fenn, 'Boxing Helena') who longs to talk to someone, but doesn't realize that by talking to the men she starts problems with Curley. A lot of people can put characters on paper that the audience really cares for, but it takes a really good actor to make you care for them onscreen. Malkovich and Sinise do just that. You like these characters. You get happy when something good happens to them and instantly depressed when it doesn't. Both give Oscar worthy work here and it amazes me that neither one scored an Oscar nomination (I'm not even sure if this film got nominated for ANY Oscar). Sinise is a great actor, with fantastic range...He captures the character of George so clearly and vividly, there's times where you forget he's acting at all. Malkovich is an absolute wonder to watch. What a complete actor this man is. He immerses himself into the role of Lennie; He has the voice and the movement and everything else down. This performance is just as good as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. The ending of the film is incredibly well written. I think the ending of the movie works better than the ending of the book (I skipped ahead a little bit). The last words are more poignant in the movie than in the book. Being as how I hadn't read that far when I saw the movie, the ending hit me even harder since I didn't know what was coming. It seems that people on Amazon like this film, which I'm quite happy to see. Because this is a great film on any level. Even if it bared no similarity to the book at all, this is a true masterpiece. If you have any appreciation for cinema, vivid characters, a great story, and amazing acting. See this movie. It's not necessarily a joyful, happy journey...But it's definitely one you want to take.

There is a terrible sense of inevitability present from the very beginning of this film; we know that fate will not be kind to Lennie.  But despite his slow march to tragedy we are transfixed by the elegant simplicity of the telling.  Sinise uses his knowledge of theatre to pare this classic story to the bone.

Malkovich, always willing to get lost in a part no matter how bizarre or extreme, doesn't act Lennie, he inhabits him.  Watching his childlike behavior and listening to his repetitive monologues we understand completely why George loves him as he does and simultaneously finds him thoroughly maddening.  Malkovich owns this role for all time, I feel badly for every actor attempting it from now on.

Extreme roles, like Lennie, allow actors lots of room to show off while simultaneously providing margin for error.  Sinise, as George, has the hardest duty and comes through with a quiet performance that is nothing short of stunning.  Every aspect of his complex relationship with Lennie is revealed almost inadvertently, hope, bitterness, anger, protectiveness, and pride to name just a few.  As director he has stitched together all the elements of this film into an organic whole, no false notes.  As director directing himself he simply inserts his own performance into a complete vision, his embodiment of George is generous - not self-serving.

The brilliance of Malkovich and Sinise should not obscure a host of wonderful supporting performances.  Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) is excellent, Joe Morton is terrific as always, Casey Siemaszko brings real malevolence as only he can, John Terry is thoroughly believable as a crew boss, and Sherilyn Fenn is exactly on point as the player who loses control of the game.

During the depression these two traveling buddies look for work in California, and get work on a farm.  Their not looking for any trouble, but trouble seems to find them in the name of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the farm owners son, 'one of those little people that don't like big people', and because of that he has something against Lennie.  Lennie is just a big teddy bear, one who likes to touch everything soft with his fingers, but he tends too touch them to hard.  When trouble rears it's head in the form of an accident George is forced to make a choice regarding his relationship with Lennie.  I don't want to say anymore for the less you know the better, but most of you have read the book or seen the original and so you probably know the ending.  I just want to warn you that I've never been so depressed after watching a film as I was after watching this.  That said, this is a masterpiece of a film and one of the best I've ever seen.  Every performance is brilliant especially Malkovich who makes you love him and cry for him in almost every scene, as well as Sherilyn Fenn who plays Curley's lonely wife who seeks out George and eventually Lennie for attention.  The sadness isn't without point I might add, for this film serves as a great example of how 'not' to treat others for it shows it heartwrenching detail the effect we have on others when we mistreat them, no matter what the reason.

This movie is based on the 1937 novella (of about a hundred pages) by John Steinbeck (1902 to 1968).  Gary Sinise, who stars in the movie, also co-produced and directed it.

The movie (and novel) is set during the time of the Great (Economic) Depression (that began in 1929 and lasted through most of the 1930s).

The movie is a dark tale that presents a human world that contains jealously, cruelty, loneliness, rootlessness, poverty, and shattered dreams.  It is a parable about two men, George (Sinise) and Lennie (John Malkovich), striving for a better life, who long for self-respect, independence, and freedom.

Lennie is a mentally deficient but a big, strong man who has a childlike innocence and is fascinated with soft things (like rabbits).  George, the smarter of the two, travels with him and is his protector.  The only thing they have in common is each other.  George explains, ""I got you to look after me and you got me to look after you.""

Their dream?  To own their own place and ""to live off the fat of the land.""  However, their plan to reach this dream does not work out.  The title of this movie (and the novel) gives this away.  It's from a phrase in a famous poet's 1785 poem:  ""The best laid dreams o'mice and men [often go awry].""

I believe that those who have not read the novel might give this movie 5 stars.  The story is well presented.  John Malkovich's performance as Lennie is exceptional.  They should also be impressed with the cinematography and background music.

However, those who have read the novel will probably see some problems.  The main problem, I feel, is with Gary Sinise as George.  He plays his role as too intelligent and I didn't feel that there was a strong, emotional connection between George and Lennie.

As well, even though all major scenes from the novel are presented, many of them are abbreviated thus leaving out important stuff Steinbeck was attempting to convey.  The dialogue in the movie seems to be too articulate.  The dialogue in the novel presents real depression-era talking (and is a highlight of the novel) where such words as ""pretty"" are pronounced ""purty"" and ""picture"" is pronounced ""pitcher.""  Finally, the ending of the novel is its highpoint but in the movie, it seems to me to be rushed and thus its emotional impact is lost (at least to me).

I believe those who have read the novel might give this movie 3.5 stars.  My actual rating of this movie is an average of the sum of these two ratings and is shown below.

Finally, the DVD itself (special edition) has good picture and sound quality.  There are six interesting extras.

In conclusion, we all have a dream.  This movie effectively illustrates how life and fate can alter that dream!!

499919,5,6302656125,"I cannot think of a movie adaptation of a ""classic"" novel in which the actors were more suited for their roles than OF MICE AND MEN (THE CRUCIBLE is close. . .).  No offense to Burgess Meredith (from the 1939 version), but John Malkovich was born to play this role (Lennie)!  His physical mannerisms (walking, sitting, working in the fields, etc.), his vocal stylings, and his slightly cross-eyed status all contribute to the overwhelming ""Lennie-ness"" he conveys.  His smile is the one I see when I think of George telling the ""tend the rabbits"" story; his voice is what I hear when I read the book now.  Malkovich IS Lennie (or vice versa. . .).  Gary Sinise is perfect as the quiet and understated George--he never tries to steal the show but lets the script and the plot situations stay in top priority position.  The supporting actors are all extremely good, from Curly, his wife, Candy, Crooks, Slim, and the farm hands--no weak links in the chain whatsoever, which is rare.  Exceptional performances all the way around, with great leadership from the two primary actors.

The script is as good as you can possibly get from an adaptation.  It is not ""word-for-word,"" but it is close enough for me as a high school English teacher.  The differences, both additions and omissions, are not significant enough to draw any criticism for me, and they provide for interesting analysis (compare/contrast) for my students.

Despite the exceptional quality of this movie, the kids still like it!!  Some very good movies are just too ""good"" for high school students to appreciate (THE GREAT GATSBY comes to mind), but this one hits them hard.  They identify very easily with George and Lennie's plight (with some help from a history lesson in Depression era economics), Lennie (Malkovich) is an incredibly likable guy, despite his obvious weaknesses and social/mental deficiencies; George scores major points from the kids for his incredibly kind treatment (for the most part) of Lennie.  The students are drawn to the very compelling social situation into which Lennie's actions force the two workers.  The climax of the movie is shattering.  Even though they know what is coming, the visual realization is difficult to watch without emotional reaction.  I believe Steinbeck would have given Sinise ""two thumbs up"" for the last ten minutes of the movie, in particular.

Bottom Line:  You're not going to find a much more compelling story, either in print or in a movie.  The themes may seem slightly outdated when looked at in the microcosm of the Depression Era, but Steinbeck presented a big picture with these two characters and their plight that even today's kids can appreciate.

They were very wise in picking John Malcovich and Gary Senise to play Lenny and George.  The movie starts with George and Lenny running away from men on horses and end up in a train car.  They get off and end up in a town; they go onto a bus, which will take them to their job.  They end up on the Tyler Ranch and meet many characters.  As the movie goes on you get to find how George and Lenny came to be friends and how they lead up to where the movie starts.  However, by the end of the movie, Lenny kills the wife of the son of the ranch and runs away.  The last part of the movie was spectacular and gave me a tear in my eye.

 Both Gary Senise and John Malcovich gave each part of the movie so perfect and were very precise.  They put so much emotion in their parts and it was as if I was there experiencing it for myself.  Lenny was a part in the movie that showed so much passion and kindness toward George and it was not one time in the movie that he would hurt George.  George was like a father figure toward Lenny and guided him throughout the whole movie.

The movie, now over a decade old, is as powerful as the book.  I have taught high school for 23+ years, and no other film I've ever shown has had this impact.  Sixteen and seventeen year olds are a pretty tough audience;  each year when I show this I am reminded of the universal language and educational impact of good cinema.

The story is about two vagabonds or migrant workers travelling  together, looking for work on ranches to earn enough money to make their dream of having their own piece of land come true. Two men who are completely different in appearance and character prove that real friendship is possible.

George, played by Gary Sinise, is the intelligent part of the duo, who takes care about his strong but simple-minded friend Lennie, excellently played by John Malkovich.

John Malkovich's acting is magnificent. He played his role exactly the way you would imagine him in the novel.

His performance as the tall dumb guy, tending to get always in trouble with pretty girls, is as perfect as it could be. His thin voice, the grotesque way of speaking, his use of colloquial speech and his lack of mimicry are only some features which are perfectly acted and make Lennie's figure seem real.

As well as Malkovich Gary Sinise , also the director, is able to create a living George, a real ""nice fellow"", as the book describes. Being Lennie's best friend, he takes care of him and could be seen as the intelligent and planning part of this 2-men-team.

Similar to Steinbeck's model, both characters are clear-cut and it is easy to concentrate on the film's message. The movie gives an interpretation of what real friendship means, the problems of lonely farmworkers without families and the desperate situation of an America that suffers from a run-down economy.

Standing between these problems of the depression, George and Lennie have one dream in common - they want to buy their own piece of land. Therefore, to earn money, they are working on a farm where almost the whole film takes place. The wheat fields, the typical farm area and thousands of small details of the book have been taken into account.

499951,5,6302656125,"John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice And Men was first adapted to big screen in 1939. But there were two more remakes following this first version by Burgess Meredith.

In 1992 Gary Sinise directed the latest version in which he himself plays George, an intelligent, hard-working man who takes care of Lennie, his intellectually handicapped friend.

Lennie is a really warm-hearted childish guy who has a soft spot for petting soft things. He always says: 'I wanna tend the rabbits', which makes him appear like someone who cannot even harm a fly. But his inability to handle his strength gets him into trouble several times. John Malkovich (Lennie) did a great job in playing this simple-mindedness but I imagined Lennie as being a bit more amusing. In the scenes in which he wants George to tell him the story about their future (`We'll live on the fatta the land, that's it George!'), Malkovich's acting doesn't excite enough empathy, which was disappointing.

But this flaw is made up for by the beautiful countryside which is shown exactly like it is described in the book. The great camera movement enables you to experience the life on an ordinary American ranch. It seems so close that you can almost smell the hay in the burning sun.

Moreover, the `down the farm' dialect underlines the simplicity of the circumstances people lived in these days.

To my mind the mis-en-scene was very well done because it corresponded almost to all of my expactations after reading the book.

I have read John Steinbeck's novel a few times.  I am seriously bothered by the constant ""using the Lord's name in vain"" in all of Steinbeck's novel, but that doesn't discount the fact that he is a great writer - one of the best of all time.  When I finally got to watch the movie, I was blown away by what a great job Malkovich and Sinise did playing their characters.  But I was even more blown away by the rest of the actors ability to step up to the plate too.  Every character was just as I pictured them in my head.
There are a few scenes that are not exactly as they were in the book: Curley's wife confronts George while he is alone in the barn...that's not in the book.  Candy walks in on Lennie and Crook in Crook's room which is not in the movie.  But these little changes matter not...the soul of each character is captured perfectly by this amazing movie!
Lennie and George are partners in their walk through life, and they couldn't be more opposite: Lennie (Malkovich) is a child in a big man's body, and George (Sinise) is the quick thinking (though never quite quick enough) sidekick determined to watch after his friend.  The two actors are amazing on screen; I could almost swear they were having a contest to see who could actually (really) change in to their character.  I think it was a tie!
I wish I could give it six stars - not an option though.
See ya next review!

499976,4,6302656125,"Fans of this movie version of John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" will be happy to find that its Special Edition transfer is quite good, on par with major DVD releases of the most recent films.  The picture quality is first-rate: color and contrast are superb, edge halos are rarely visible, and the picture depth gives the video a very film-like appearance.  The golden-hued depictions of Central California are really brought to life.  The excellent transfer will be greatly appreciated on larger screens.  The audio itself is nothing special, owing to its lower budget origins, but it is clear.
The Special Edition was made as a ""flipper"" disc (presumably DVD-14, which is rarely used these days): one side has the movie, and other side is devoted to special features.
""Of Mice and Men"" was mostly overlooked when it was released in 1992, but Gary Sinise made a very capable adaptation (from Horton Foote's screenplay).  The highlight is an excellent performance by John Malkovich -- playing against type -- as Lennie.  The movie is very straightforward, which allows for Steinbeck's grounded observations on humanity to come to life.",1084924800,,1136,5.048128342245989

Sinise took the book word for word and even made several parts into a comedic scene.  Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lenny, make a brilliant on screen duo.  Malkovich had a superb performance as mentally retarded Lenny.  He fit in perfectly into character and made me believe that he had the mental capacity that Lenny had.  Ray Walston, who played the role of candy, portrayed an old man with almost nothing left.  He was extremely attached to his dog, which was shot to be put out of his misery.

This hope is what keeps the two persevering.  The movie recreates the events in the book exactly.

499982,5,6302656125,"As an enthusiastic fan of John Steinbeck, I cannot think of a more perfect package than a Steinbeck novel adapted to film and starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, with the added bonus of Gary Sinise directing.  This has to be one of Steinbecks most loved tales and the casting of Gary Sinise (George) and John Malkovich (Lennie) is pure genius.  No one could possibly have captured the gentle giant, Lennie, any better than John Malkovich.  Furthermore, if you love the book, it loses nothing in translation to film.  A moving tale of two men travelling for work, Lennie continually gets into trouble purely because of his childlike innocence which is misunderstood by other adults who only see a big man who should know better. George does his best to protect Lennie but unfortunately, all of George's efforts to keep Lennie out of trouble by promising his dream of tending rabbits is just one more job away if he behaves himself come to the tragic finale that makes this such an enchanting tale.  Sinise & Malkovich are so convincing as these wonderful characters, it could not fail to touch even the hardest heart.  I love John Malkovich - but this, to me, is his best performance ever.  Steinbeck movies attract the greats, John Garfield and Spencer Tracy in Tortilla Flat for example, but of all the adaptations I've seen, this is by far the best.",1067040000,2,1356,4.74468085106383
499983,4,6302656125,"What a masterful and faithful portrayal of Steinbeck's classic (eponymous) novel. The screenplay brings to life the tragic yet uplifting story of loyalty and the kind of bond that can grow between men that we are often reluctant to acknowledge, much less show.
Aside from the story, the cast is what really makes this film. I have always held a soft spot for Gary Sinise after his role in Forrest Gump, wherein his character portrayed another facet of the bonding between men made brothers by cruel circumstance, yet can grow and flourish as the years and other circumstances come to pass. Here, as Lenny's friend and protector against a world that baffles and confuses him, he shows the kind of rough-edged tenderness and affection that both endears us to his plight, and fills us with the dread of what we know must come between the men.
John Malkovich shows his range as an actor by bringing to life the dull-witted but pure-hearted Lenny, in a way that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself both laughing (in a sad way) at Lenny's ineptness in dealing with a world clearly more confusing than his limited wits can manage, and crying over his being targeted for taunting and abuse by cruel and crude men, and ultimately done in by his brute strength when it was lacking the direction and temper given by his friend George.
A pleasant surprise was Ray Walston as the aged but gentle and good-hearted ranch hand Candy, who has no one in life to love but his old sheepdog, who, like him, he knows, must ultimately be ""put down"" because of age and the wear and tear that a life of hard labor has worn down. The scene of his finally surrendering his faithful canine companion to be euthanized by a gunshot to the back of the head by another well-meaning field hand is very heartbreaking. Having grown up with the ""Uncle Martin"" of ""My Favorite Martian"" Walston, seeing his adept performance in a dramatic role gave me a new appreciation for his versatility as a character actor.
Those who watch this film should allow plenty of time alone to view it straight through with no interruptions. Swallow your pride and keep a box of tissues handy, and some time afterwards for quiet contemplation and ""recovery.""",1066089600,9,2212,4.688946015424165

A wonderful supporting cast and beautiful cinematography.  I was even more amazed to discover that this film was directed by Sinise, whose talents are certainly underrated.  This version is probably even better than Steinbeck's novel, although it may seem sacreligious to say it.  Not to be missed under any circumstances.",1059868800,,575,5.150537634408602
500004,4,6302656125,"""Of Mice and Men"" is an adaptation of the famous John Steinbeck book. The director of the film, Gary Sinise, also stars as George. His performance is commanding and really makes the audience empathize with his feeling that Lennie, played by John Malkovich, is kind of ruining his life. George often wondered what it would have been like if he didn't have to take care of Lennie, but he never let Lennie know that.
 The film follows the story of two men just trying to get by. Set during the Depression in the hometown of writer Steinbeck's hometown of Salinas, California, it adds a little bit extra to the film, instead of just shooting it all in the Midwest or on soundstages. There are farmlands out in California, its not just Los Angeles, but many people don't think so. The film is essentially an ensemble piece but the ensemble is much smaller in comparison to that of a film like ""Traffic"", in which there are 147 speaking parts.
  Given the sensitivity of the material, John Malkovich's performance as Lennie, the gentle but intimidating giant companion to George, is the best in the film. If this film were a ship, Malkovich is the captain and Sinise is first mate. Malkovich's portrayal of Lennie shines stays good throughout the duration of the film, but in the scenes where he asks George to tell him about the little place of their own, he seems so childlike its like you're watching a five-year-old on screen. He holds your eyes to the screen.
  The best scenes in the movie are when Lennie and George are talking alone and unfortunately, there are hardly enough of them. When you see the chemistry these two actors have together, its incredible.
  The slight downfall to this movie is the completely annoying and overbearing performance by Casey Siemaszko as Curley. I really wanted to slap him through every scene where he was shown. This movie could've easily gotten four or five stars but he had to ruin it. Sherilyn Fenn more than made up for his faults to deliver a good, strong performance. She was said to have a ""wandering eye"" in the book and she pulled it off perfectly in the film. She was very flirtatious in her mannerisms and in the way she spoke to George.
  Since it was set in the farmlands, the rustic look of everything was very fitting. The music worked well for the film, even though composer Mark Isham missed out on two wasted musical sequences, one being the fight between Curley and Lennie, the other being the end of the film where George shoots Lennie in the back of the head. Usually these types of scenes call for some seriously sad music, but he used his skill sparingly.
  All in all, the film was very faithful to the book. The performances were good, despite one way-too-over-the-top one, and everything worked really well to bring the book to life.",1052870400,2,2798,4.632323232323232

Gary Sinise was perfect for the cynical and smug role of George, but I was pleasantly surprised by Malkovich - where was the Oscar nod?
Having read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it, the movie was hardly a disappointment as most movies based on classics turn out to be(Exhibit A:Mel Gibson's Hamlet).

500011,5,6302656125,"This isn't just a wonderful portrayal of John Steinbeck's Masterpiece; it's a wonderful film in general.  ""Of Mice and Men"" is a marvelous picture that plays on all of our emotions.
The movie is about two men who travel together all the time, hoping to own an acre of land and a nice home they can call their own. George is a smart man who always seems to have things figured out. Lennie is a giant with a mind of a young child. George looks after him, but it is not easy. Lennie always seems to get himself in some kind of trouble, and George is always the one who has to help him out.  The two eventually land jobs on a ranch, hoping to make enough money to make their dreams come true.  But that might be difficult when Lennie once again gets the two in serious trouble.
The movie is directed by Gary Sinise, who does a spectacular job of bringing Steinbeck's wonderful novel to life.  Just from seeing this movie alone, I think he has nothing but talent when it comes to sitting in the director's chair.  He really should direct more.  Also, he is a great actor, and plays the role of George flawlessly.  He's everything I envisioned when reading the book.
John Malkovich plays Lennie, and does an outstanding job at doing so.  I sort of had my doubts at first, because I thought of Lennie as a giant, and Malkovich didn't seem like a giant to me.  Well, when I was watching the movie, that all changed.  He did the part justice.  It's a crime that he didn't win anything for his role (or at least nothing I am aware of.)
The movie stays very true to the book.  Sure, as always, there are things removed or added.  Mostly, there are things added because the novel is so short, they needed to add things to make the movie longer.  Everything that was added worked and stayed true to the original story.
The picture and sound quality was really up to par.  It is 16:9 widescreen; aspect ratio 1.85:1.  It looked really good; very crystal clear.  Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't have much to offer in the special features department, with the exception of a trailer for the movie.
""Of Mice and Men"" is a spectacular movie that should've won a couple of Academy Awards.  Everything about this film was outstanding.  It is one I will watch over and over again.

I think that this movie is a great movie to watch to either introduce the novel or as a suplementary to the novel. This movie brings to life Steinbeck country, with rich landscape views of the country life that many of the Steinbeck characters live. Obviously in a movie that is an adaptation of a novel, deletions must occur. However, the scenes that are covered explain much of the novel and make this an emotional story.

The script, by Oscar-winning screen writer Horton Foote, is just esquisite, and as always, it will ultimately break your heart.
John Malkovich as Lenny, the brain-damaged lumbering farm-hand with more strength than he knows how to control, puts in one of the finest performances of his career, and it's been a pretty impressive career.
Gary Sinise - in a performance which brought him the attention he always deserved but Malkovich got - is faultless.  He is a powerhouse performer, and a cinematic treasure.  As a director, he has a clear vision of Depression era America which be evokes vividly and tells this powerful tale simply and elegantly.

While MGM has seen fit to release special editions of forgettable (but apparently marketable) titles such as ""Phantasm"" and ""Antitrust,"" this stunning version of an American classic does not merit a Dolby 5.1 remix or any special features.

It strikes me as one of the truly great cinematic adaptations of a literary classic. The screenplay is remarkably faithful to both the letter and spirit of Steinbeck; the photography by Kenneth MacMillan is heartbreakingly beautiful; and the performances by Sinise, John Malkovich and Ray Walston are almost unbearably poignant. My sister, a high-school English teacher, shows this film to all of her classes, and all of them have loved it. This is the rare movie that really imparts the flavor and significance of the novel on which it is based.",978307200,110,678,4.904347826086957
500036,1,6302656125,"As a big Steinbeck fan, I just have to ask, ""What were they thinking?""  I saw this 1992 version of Steinbeck's classic tale while working as a substitute teacher and was very disappointed.  This version, while using more of the salty language found in the story (the script has all the ""Damns!"" and ""G*ddamns!"" of Steinbeck's novel), has almost no dramatic tension and leaves the viewer feeling hollow, as if you had just watched an exercise in an acting class.
The acting is the weakest link in this production's flabby armor.  While watching it, you get the feeling that the entire cast is entirely too aware that they acting and every scene feels forced.  There are almost no moments where the acting feels natural.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment is John Malkovich's cloying, sweet-as-pie Lennie.  Overwrought is how Malkovich plays most of his scenes.  He tries too hard to turn Lennie into a cuddly stuffed-animal instead of a real, human character.  He simply overdoes it trying to work on the audience's sympathies, and ends up making us roll our eyes.  Sinise, on the other hand, is wooden and insincere as George, complete with Sinise's signature unidentifiable, somewhere-in-the-Midwest accent that he uses whenever he plays ""ordinary, working folk"" (I think he used the same accent in ""The Stand"").
Sinise's direction is similarly uninspired.  The death scene of Lennie, which should have been the climax of the film, feels rushed, and loses any emotional impact it should have carried.
Now I have to admit that my review is biased.  The 1939, Lewis Milestone version of ""Of Mice and Men"" is my favorite movie of all time.  The acting is top-notch.  Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney act circles around Malkovich and Sinise.  The entire production is unflawed.
I suggest you stick with the original.  The Sinise version proves you can't improve upon perfection.",974419200,8,1875,5.022653721682848
500037,5,6302656125,"Having been a big fan of the book, I was a little skeptical when I first rented this movie.  I had never seen the original version with Lon Chaney and Burgess Meredith, but I did not see how such a short book could  translate in to a full production movie and still hold true to the book.  I  was pleasantly surprised to see how well Gary Sinise told Steinback's  classic tale, and how all of the characters were as believable as they were  in the book.  Perhaps the biggest surprise performance in this movie comes  from Joe Morton, who plays the stable worker Crooks.  The scene he shares  with Malkovich's character Lenny when the other workers go to town is a  subtle reminder of how everyone could use a friend from time to time, and  it really hits on the friendship theme which is often ignored when this  book is discussed.  This movie is a must see for fans of the book, or for  anyone who wants to see a movie which earns its stripes by its story and  performances.",963273600,,975,4.333333333333333
500038,4,6302656125,"I'm studing this text for my GCSE, very intesting it is too. I managed to see both adaptions of the film which really helpes me to get the overall storyline clear. This I think was the slightly better version but not by  far.  At the risk of being slightly sterotypical, I would say that having  read the book, Sinise looked remarkably like you would imagine. His acting  was of course inpeccable.  Also the other actor who fitted the part very  well was old Candy. His description almost exactly fitted the one in the  book and the actor played the emotional scenes remarkably well. The only  actor who I didn't fing convincing was Lennie. John Malkovich didn't fit  the role at all and I think the would have been much better off with  someone else. The problem with him (apart from just not looking the part)  was his diction. Lennie may have been stupid but people could understand  him. Malkovich talks like a 2year old throughout and this is really quite  irritating. Other that this fault, the film was very useful to me. It was  usually accurate to the plot of the original book and the text also. 4  Stars may be slighly harsh if there was a 4 and 1/2 it would get that.",959817600,,1179,4.44392523364486
500039,4,6302656125,"A great movie of fraternal love, lonliness and kindness.  But hope is the thread that ties this movie together.

500040,4,6302656125,"I read ""Of Mice and Men"" for my English GCSE course,and I still can't get my mind around how simple and perfect it is as abook. Gary Sinise's film is a truthful adaptation, with only some slight changes, and captures the mood of the book pretty well.  I have to say that the most moving scene for me is still the final one. It brings tears to my eyes, every time. The cinematography is beautiful, all green foliage and crisp golden wheat - the use of light is particularly effective in moments such as the pivotal barn scene, where the golden beams peering through the darkened slats of wood make the picture both shadowy and light at the same time ...  John Malkovich is excellent as the retarded Lennie - it is always difficult to accept watching a well-known and intelligent actor play a retard, but he manages to defeat the viewer's preconceptions, and he convincingly shows Lennie's childishness, his incomprehension. Gary Sinise is perfect as George: physically suited, subtle and deeply moving.  Hehe ... now for the inevitable nit-picking. The main problem - though not so much a problem as a bit too much of a good thing - is that the setting seems to have been evoked so caringly it is almost too lavish.  It threatens to make the workers' lifestyle seem too attractive, not more detached and monotonous as it appears in the book. The support cast, while good are maybe sometimes too obviously sympathetic - Curley's wife's mean streak has been played down, and Slim seems more ordinary, less detached and ""majestic"" than in the book.  These are minor flaws though. In fact, the film's structure is quite sparse, and does not fall into the trap that other adaptations can, of sprawling or simply relying on the book's clout and key scenes to see them through.  All in all, a pretty faithful adaptation of a beyond-excellent story, well worth watching if you love the original book!",958348800,7,1891,4.715151515151515
500041,4,6302656125,"Halfway into the movie, you will ask yourself, ""Where have I seen this theme?"" and you should answer, ""Slingblade"".  Both contain little boys stuck in men's bodies that, while they purposely  wouldn't hurt a mouse or a child, they can unwittingly unlease a fury to  protect someone they love.
This is one of those movies, where you root  for a happy ending but know how it's going to turn out.  Mostly all the  characters seemed believable except the the boss' son and his wife and the  black hired hand.  They seem only to exist to cause the emotional tension  in the movie.
Everyone else gave dignified performances that you  identified with.  I agree with another reviewer that Ray Walston's  character was heartbreaking.
John Malkovich joins a long line of actors  that play simpletons:  Dustin Hoffman- Rainman, Tom Hanks- Forrest Gump,  Billy Bob Thornton- Slingblade, Michael Duncan Clarke- The Green Mile.  Their performances are so poignant because one gets occassionally tired of  cynical, sarcastic people and we love to see the world through the eyes of  people who see it simply without its complications.
Gary Sinise is  completely believable as a field hands who has his own dreams but chooses  to delay them to take care of someone that he considers, on a certain  level, to be a friend.
Credit also needs to go to the supporting cast who  provide the support the main actors need.
I appreciated the subtlety in  the scenes.  Too many movies are too graphic and not suitable for family  viewing.  The PG-13 rating was a plus.
Although depressing and  disturbing, it is a must see because it is memorable.",957657600,,1620,4.8388278388278385
500042,5,6302656125,"To put it simply, this is possibly the most overlooked film of the 1990's. Never before (or since) have i ever PAID to see a movie in the theatre 4 times. One of the most simplistic enthralling moviegoing experiences one  could ever hope to find. This film ranks on my top 5 films of all time, as  modern films touch us so seldom, you must recognize a crowning acheivement.  I agree with a review below that the cinematography is one of a kind.  The blowing barley fields, periwinkle skies and dusty roads are almost felt  by the viewer upon watching. I do not think there is a comparison to be  made with the 1939 version. Malkovich acts circles around Lon Chaney and  Gary Sinise's masterful subtle performance makes Burgess Meredith look  foolish. Such a shame that more people did not find this treasure while in  the theatres. Believe it or not, when I first met my future husband, he  informed me that not only had he seen this version of ""Of Mice &  men"" (Which was an absolute first for me, I thought I was the only one  for a while) He had given it 4 stars in his personal review. Needless to  say, I had a feeling that I had found the perfect match for myself. THIS is  what filmmaking is all about people. Please take note.......",954979200,25,1240,4.381578947368421

500044,5,6302656125,"This movie is definately worth the five stars, even with certain flaws.  I agree with the idea that the fight scene could use a little work, as it didn't capture the emotion of the fight as the book did.  It was too...  quiet?  Something to that effect.  The rest of the movie is wonderful, as  it is sad.  But the humanitarian aspect at the end is very well  thought-out, and really captures the essence of the meaning of Lennie's  death.
Truly an inspiration, and a good example of Sinese's directing and  acting talent.  Of course Malkovich has done quite well in this film.  Really an all-star cast, and all-star character portrayals.",945302400,20,638,4.648648648648648
