7907915,4,B00000FAXT,"This 1930 black and white crime drama is filled with humor in virtually every scene, Ronald Colman plays a cat burglar who is very likable, even by the Scottish Scotland Yard inspector who is trying to catch him. The inspector brags to Coleman before he knows that he is the cat burglar, that he will catch him. Coleman, in turn, tries to outwit him.
Coleman decides to give up crime because he wants to marry a woman he loves and settle down. However, a close friend of his needs a thousand pounds, a huge amount of money in 1930. So Colman decides to steal a necklace. Many things go wrong before, during, and after the robbery, but it all adds to the fun. The film is a little granny and the plot and acting is somewhat outdated, but the film is still fun to watch.",1499558400,,768,4.303448275862069
7907916,4,B00000FAXT,"- Raffles toys with the police: ""I can tell you what he is. He's a myth, a phantom, an up-to-date jack-o'-lantern invented by the police... Everytime Scotland Yard fails to catch the perpetrator of some decently intelligent theft, they blame the Cracksman.""

Ronald Colman, that supremely poised Englishman, was neither the first nor the last to play A.J. Raffles on the screen, but he may be the best to have done it, just as he's the best Bulldog Drummond. Sorry, John Barrymore. Sorry, David Niven and Anthony Valentine. But no one else quite had Colman's sublime delivery and that air of unflappability. RAFFLES, released in 1930, was only one film removed from 1929'S BULLDOG DRUMMOND, the landmark film which extended Colman's acting career and transitioned him from silent to talkies. RAFFLES cemented him even more firmly as that suave gent with the honeyed voice and the impeccable way with diction. Matinee idol, yes indeed.

Forgive this film its trespasses. In 1930, the audio technology was far from perfected (for its time, it's actually not too shabby; it was even nominated for Best Sound). The plot is kinda creaky, enlivened only by Colman's presence. The plot goes something like this: For the sake of his dear, lovely socialite girlfriend Gwen (played by sophisticated Kay Francis), the notorious Amateur Cracksman has just called it a day. A.J. Raffles has burgled his last safe, has absconded with his last bit of ice. Except that, thankfully for us, it's a short retirement. To extricate his hapless pal ""Bunny"" Manders from an embarassing debt, Raffles dives back into his thieving ways. Mere hours after his self-rehabilitation, he's pulling off another jewel heist. My, that precious necklace sure is sparkly.

A.J. Raffles hobnobs with England's upper crust during the day, steals them blind during the night, and we love him for it. The press makes him out almost as a folk hero. You can blame E.W. Hornung - who was brother-in-law to Sherlock Holmes' creator, Arthur Conan Doyle - for romanticizing such a shady profession. But this gentleman burglar is stricken with a case of good samaritan, and this trait is what redeems him. And, although Colman's version of Raffles doesn't do much to champion the needy and impoverished (I'm pretty sure ""Bunny"" doesn't count), he's a wicked hand at cricket and the gent's so charming and amiable. Friend, I'll have you know that cooly cracking a safe whilst in a top hat is the very definition of swagger.

On the same evening that the Amateur Cracksman targets a stately country manor, a dodgy crew of thieves also moves in for the snatch. Raffles finds himself not only foiling his low-rent rivals but also having to elude a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector. But all these taut cat and mouse games pale next to the sudden dilemma of his lady friend Gwen who is also beginning to sniff something fishy about A.J. Raffles. Good thing the Amateur Cracksman is a smooth operator in more than just the field of nicking stuff. He's so charming that, at the end, even the Scotland Yard Inspector ruefully remarks: ""Well, one can't help liking him.""",1313712000,,3115,4.938931297709924
7907917,2,B00000FAXT,"A.J. Raffles was a character created in the late 19th Century by E.W. Hornung, the brother-in-law of Arthur Canon Doyle. Raffles first appeared in 1898 in magazine form and then in 4 books between 1899 and 1909 as well as a 1903 play. It was filmed as early as 1905, played by the great John Barrymore in 1917, and by House Peters in 1925.

Hornung's ""Raffles"" is the obverse of Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"" - Holmes is the gentleman who serves society as a detective and Raffles is the gentleman who preys on society as a thief. Holmes' hobby is quietly playing the violin but Raffles hobby is being a first rate Cricketeer. Both men have a loyal sidekick (Dr. Watson/Bunny Manders), but Watson shares in Holmes' detective work while Bunny is unaware of his friend's alter ego. Raffles is great with the ladies, and Holmes rarely has an heterosexual contact.

Handsome Ronald Coleman (1891-1958) plays Raffles. Coleman was a silent film actor whose rich, melodious voice propelled him to stardom when talkies came out. He was Oscar nominated for two films in one year - 1929 (""Bulldog Drummond"" and Condemned""), and again in 1942 (""Random Harvest"") and finally won in 1947 (""A Double Life""), for which he also won the Golden Globe.

Kay Francis (1905-68) plays the woman who tempts Coleman to go straight. Francis was the #1 Warner's female star in the mid 30s, before Bette Davis took over. She won no awards but her films like ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932), ""One Way Passage"" (1932), ""I Found Stella Parrish"" (1935) and ""Confession"" (1937) were box office hits.

Following this film, Raffles appeared again in 1933, then in 1939 with David Niven (the most definitive version). In the 1970s he appeared in a TV movie and a TV series, and was last heard from in ""The Gentleman Thief"" (2001) although his character also inspired other ""gentlemen thief"" characters like Cary Grant in ""To Catch a Thief"" (1955), Robert Wagner in ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968) and Matt Borner in ""White Collar"" (2010-11)

The film is directed by George Fitzmaurice (1885-1940) who was best known for ""Son of the Sheik"" (1926) among the 80+ films he directed between 1914 and 1940.

In 1930 the top grossing films were ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", Eddie Cantor's ""Whoopee"", ""Hell's Angels"", ""Animal Crackers"", and Harold Lloyd's ""Feet First"". ""All Quiet"" was the big Oscar winner (Picture, Director). Other notable films released that year include ""Disraeli"" (George Arliss won the Oscar), ""The Divorce"" (Norma Shearer won the Oscar), Garbo's ""Anna Christie"", Wallace Beery's ""Big House"" and ""Min and Bill"", John Wayne's massive failure ""The Big Trail"", ""Little Caesar"", ""The Blue Angel"", Tod Browning's ""The Unholy Three"", and Howard Hawks' ""Dawn Patrol"".

The film is dated and very British in a 30s sort of way. If you enjoy that kind of film, you'll find it interesting, though there is really nothing special to recommend it. There are far better films from 1930.",1312675200,,2944,4.9114688128772634
7907918,4,B00000FAXT,"United Artists  presents ""RAFFLES"" (1930) (72 min/B&W) -- Starring Ronald Colman, Kay Francis, Bramwell Fletcher, Frances Dade, Alison Skipworth & David Torrence

Directed by George Fitzmaurice

The third in a succession of film adaptations of author E.W. Hornung's novel Raffles, the Amateur Cracks man, this version was the first to also be produced in sound. Ronald Colman stars as A.J. Raffles, an utterly unflappable British gentleman cricket player who by night is secretly a thief known in the press as The Amateur Cracks man and causing apoplectic fits at Scotland Yard.

Raffles has fallen in love with society girl Gwen Manders (Kay Francis) and intends to give up his criminal pursuits, but first he must help an indebted pal, Bunny (Bramwell Fletcher) by stealing a valuable necklace owned by Lady Melrose (Alison Skipworth) at a weekend soire. Suspecting that Raffles and the Cracks man are one and the same, Inspector McKenzie (David Torrence) is a guest at the same party, with a keen eye peeled at Raffles. In the meantime, rival crook Crawshaw also has designs on the necklace, setting himself as an unfortunately perfect scapegoat.

7907919,4,B00000FAXT,"The dark of night...an open safe...a well-dressed man, gloved hands removing a beautiful gold necklace...a card left in it's place - ""The Amateur Cracksman"".  Scourge of London, the police have no idea who is behind the daring heist - not the first one.  But we in the audience know right away - it's A.J. Raffles (Ronald Colman), a gentleman of seemingly independent means.  He's enjoyed his life of crime, but now he's about to give it up for the love of a good woman, Gwen (Kay Francis) - until his good friend Bunny (Bramwell Fletcher) needs a thousands pounds to stave off ruin and scandal.  Bunny's been invited to the estate of Lord and Lady Melrose (Frederick Kerr and Alison Skipworth), and Lady Melrose possesses a very valuable diamond necklace.  A plan forms...

The fourth film (the first with sound) based on stories about the gentleman thief, this 1930 Samuel Goldwyn production is actually an adaptation of a play, ""Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman"" by Eugene Wiley Presbrey and E.W. Hornung, taken from the latter's novel.  The Raffles stories were very popular in Britain for decades after their first publication in the 1890s, and in fact there was a sequel to this film (without Colman) in 1933 and there have been a few attempts at reviving the character subsequently, but he's certainly an obscure and cultish figure now.  I don't know much about the stories - Hornung was the brother-in-law of Arthur Conan Doyle, and they apparently were written as a sort of mirror reflection of Sherlock Holmes - but based on this film, I wouldn't mind making their acquaintance.

Though it suffers a bit both from the creakiness of the very early sound period (long periods of near-silence, and a few overripe performances, most notably Fletcher's) and from it's origin as a play (it basically consists of two setpieces - first the country manner, and second Raffles' apartment in London), the film on the whole moves swiftly and steadily and is loads of fun.  Colman is great and was born to play this role I think, and Kerr and Skipworth as the Lord and Lady are lots of fun, though the most memorable role is probably that of the egotistical Scottish Inspector McKenzie (David Torrence) whose verbal sparring with Raffles occupies a good portion of the second half.  George Fitzmaurice's direction is excellent, with a long-take style that might have seemed static in a light comedic work like this, but his fluid, smooth zooms and pans make for some excellent visuals, particularly in the extensive manor sets.  Two of the greatest Hollywood cinematographers of this period, Gregg Toland and George Barnes, handled the photography.

Not a life-changing film or anything, but fans of Colman or the character certainly ought to be checking this out, though it's not on a R1 DVD.  A package with this and the sequel would be just lovely, but I'm sure not holding my breath...",1289779200,,2884,4.871165644171779
7907920,3,B00000FAXT,"Ronald Colman stars in this 1930 version, based on Ernest William Hornung's short stories, of THE AMATEUR CRACKSMAN (1899). Raffles, played by Colman; mixes cricket and crime, eludes the police, and uses his famous voice to full romantic effect.

However, after viewing the film, you may not be surprised to learn that there were directorial difficulties.  Apparently, Goldwyn found Harry D'Arrast's pacing too fast and replaced him with George Fitzmaurice.  The result, in my opinion, is a little uneven. It takes awhile for this one to get going.

But what is really lacking here are the dialogue and situational comedy between Bunny and Raffles.  They are, after all, key elements that make the short stories so magical and endearing.

That aside, it is still a treat for 1930s film buffs:  Ronald Colman, a mansion dinner party, Scotland Yard, a jewel theft, and some George Barnes/Gregg Toland cinematography.  Nevertheless, it could have been a much better picture, especially with respect to all the talent involved.",1233532800,,1023,5.195121951219512
7907921,5,B00000FAXT,"The slightest touch of arthritis in parts of the plot, a couple of subordinate players not quite ready for talkies, but, undeniably, another wonderful outing with the indefatigable Ronald Colman.
There need be no talk of better or poorer actors between that pioneer generation and our current one; what is undeniable is that they created acting persona's different from those available to someone trained in the modern school trying to appeal to the contemporary public. Colman is The English Gentleman with none of the underlying irony and self-awareness that Rex Harrison brought to the role.
At the same time as William Powell was perfecting The American Gentleman in a series of amateur detective mysteries, Colman was perfecting his character of the debonair, impossible to be other than straight arrow, hero in Raffles, Bulldog Drummond and other outings.
The film looks and sounds good so that nothing will interfere with the pleasure of watching a workmanlike crew performing to no other purpose than giving us a bit of uncomplicated gratification,",1218412800,3,1056,5.254437869822485
7907922,4,B00000FAXT,"In a fine performance which showcased his famous voice, Ronald Colman plays A.J. Raffles, a famed British cricket player who is also the ""Amateur Cracksman"" an equally famous criminal who constantly eludes Scotland Yard. Based upon the 1899 novel THE AMATEUR CRACKSMAN by Ernest William Hornung, the cast includes Kay Francis as Lady Gwen Manders (later played by Olivia de Havilland in the inferior 1939 version starring David Niven), the now-forgotten Frances Dade and, as Lady Kitty Melrose, Alison Skipworth. The direction of this film was done by two men: the French D'Arrast was fired by Goldwyn after endless bickering; he was replaced by George Fitzmaurice.  This film received almost unanimously favourable reviews when it was released in 1930; both Samuel Goldwyn and Ronald Colman benefitted by the advent of sound in the movies: Goldwyn would produce some of the finest, most prestigious films in Hollywood, and Colman would make women swoon with his perfectly modulated English speaking voice (he could also act as well).",1030665600,11,1034,5.266666666666667
7907923,4,B00000FAXT,"Buy it..watch it..enjoy it..savor it.  Yes, another Colman film for the old collection.  So you are running out of shelf space.  One can always find space for another RC movie.  Do it, you won't be disappointed.",962841600,5,211,4.777777777777778
7907924,3,B00000FAXT,"I just saw this excellent restoration of a 1930 talkie from Goldwyn Studios.  The black and white camera work is good; even the sound is good!  It has been digitally reprocessed for surround sound.  Ronald Colman is  suave as ever as Raffles, the amateur cracksman.  Kay Francis is also  charming as Colman's love interest.  Colman and Francis would team again  two years later in the shamefully neglected film, Cynara (1932).  Hopefully, Goldwyn Studios will restore it also.  I know some critics might  call a movie such as Raffles a trifle dated, but therein lies its charm!  Having just seen the new Austin Powers film, it was nice sitting back,  relaxing, and watching this chamber drama from another era.  Highly  recommended!  I give it 3 stars only in comparison to some of Colman's  other great films.",929318400,15,810,4.881481481481481
