8051003,4,B0007RRG0I,"TJ Hemphill has been doing the stage play, Perilous Times in Detroit for many years. I first saw it when I was a young teenager. It absolutely changed my life. The script is one of the best out there, the acting is great, and the set designs are superb. It's the best Gospel Play I've seen to date.

Now, the awesome play gets the DVD treatment. It's still a powerful experience, because the Gospel presentation is excellent, but I must admit I was a little disappointed with the production of the DVD. This play is VERY well established, not only in Detroit, but around the Country, and I wish a better effort had been put into the DVD's Production.

But regardless of the production, I still HIGHLY recommend this DVD. The Play (done somewhat in Movie format, which is unique within itself) is still powerful enough to move the hardest heart. The singing and song writting is absolutely exhilarating. It's well cast. It's funny, sad, moving, touching, and it deals with issues that really need to be dealt with in this day and time, for we are truly living in PERLIOUS TIMES!!!!!!!",1124496000,17,1083,4.635416666666667
