8641591,5,B00IEJXG1Y,"I am a medium to high level intermediate exerciser.  I loved these workouts and was challenged by them.  Aimee has a good personality and was motivating.  I have a huge collection of workout dvds, as I try to workout daily, and don't want to get bored.  This dvd was an excellent addition to my collection.  And, it is 1 hour long in total, broken into 20 minute sections. I'm really happy that I bought it.",1454889600,,407,4.373333333333333
8641592,4,B00IEJXG1Y,"It's a trick to write a review for a workout that isn't for you, but that you think is well done.  I really like Aimee Nicotera, even though I ended up not keeping this workout.  She's fresh and encouraging and organized and motivating.  Her two background exercisers are fine; they're just sort of there.

This DVD has four short workouts on it:

Upper Body Blast (19 Minutes) -This segment starts with push ups and ends with push ups/renegade rows.  In between are moves to work other upper-body muscles: biceps, triceps, etc.  Given that I have arthritic hands and usually avoid push ups, this segment wouldn't really work for me in the long term.  But, she really does blast the upper body; I felt well worked out at the end of it.

Lower Body Blast (21 Minutes) - This segment just fries the lower body.  After 10 minutes, I was feeling it.  It is made of soley of squats and lunges, mostly squats.  At one point, she says something like, ""This is a squatfest...""  Um yeah.  I found it kind of tedious and my knee replacement didn't like THAT many squats.  If you like squats and lunges, you would probably enjoy this segment.  She does squats with leg lifts in various directions which gives some variety.  Not enough for me, but for someone.

Cardio Kickboxing (21 Minutes) - If you like slow-paced cardio kickboxing, then this segment is for you.  I like how she slowly builds a combination giving time for all the moves to be completed at a moderate pace.  After some of hte lightning fast kickboxing routines I've seen, it is a nice change of pace.

Bonus: Fit Kids (22 Minutes) - She does various challenges and partner exercises with a bunch of kids.",1427155200,,1662,4.566101694915254

8641594,5,B00IEJXG1Y,"The workout is made up of 3 20-minute segments. The Lower Body Blast is a killer! At least it was for me. The exercises are variations of squats, lunges, pli&eacute;s and balance done with weights (at some points I had to put the weights down). The Upper Body Blast is a killer too. Excellent and varied exercises which do not leave any muscle unworked. I had to modify a little bit for the push ups, but I can see how doing it regularly, my upper body strength will improve. The Cardio Kickboxing is pure bliss. I love love love it. The choreography is not difficult, taught step by step and above all FUN. I would say this workout is intermediate with options for both beginners and advanced. Excellent!",1392595200,4,705,4.515625
