8190533,5,B000PCL7Q4,"I actually enjoyed this particular series better than the preceding ones, perhaps because I knew less about--or at least understood less of--the contents from prior reading of my own.  I felt I had a far better understanding of stellar astronomy with Professor Filippenko's discussion of issues such as how astronomers derive the information they do about the physical properties of stars other than our own.  I certainly have a far greater appreciation for the incredible ingenuity of those scientists who have been able to extract knowledge and theories from even the tiniest scrap of information that observational astronomers have been able to provide them.

The professor explains in quite clear detail--and without an overabundance of mathematical equations, which might scare off the more math shy viewer--just how the distance, luminescence, mass, etc. of even some of the most distant visible stars has been calculated and what this information says about the relationships of stars and of various parts of the universe tells us about reality.  He also reveals how data about a large number of stars, fitted into a statistical model reflected by a graph can tell us much about our own star the sun and about new stars as they are discovered.

I found the graphic illustrations in this seriers somewhat more interesting than in the earlier series of lectures, though I still miss the majesty of what computer graphics is able to add to more recent productions on the science of astronomy. Still, this is intended to be more of a classroom approach to learning, so it focuses on the style of lecture normally found there.  Certainly the classroom lecture, at least as practiced in real time, is more responsive to the incremental additions to the knowledge base of science providing the instructor is active in his own learning and contributions to his field.  The time and expense of producing a TV program on astronomy must necessarily slow down any major update without similar reinvestments of capital.  To the extent that a lecture series such as this one is less expensive to update, the learning it promises can be kept more current--but do note that even this series is over a decade old.  Keeping truely current is something that remains the responsiblity of the student or interested follower of the science.

While the series is rather on the old side for a science, nothing in the lectures is really what might be called ""out of date.""  Rather there is a lack of the newer discoveries provided by more recent orbiting telescopes.  The theories underlying the science of astronomy and astrophysics have remained essentially unmodified.  This might however change if the new European large hadran collider at CERN comes up with new particles, the suggestion of new forces, or even a mini-black hole as have been postulated, or if something more definite is discovered about black matter and black energy--including their non-existance.

A very instructive series of lectures.",1283904000,,2992,5.0920245398773005
