8613646,5,B00FA2DDF2,"The Geneva Lake Museum transformed a Theater Exhibit to allow for guests to actually ""sit"" inside the theater.  This then required a movie to be playing that was done during the period of the theater and this DVD was spot on.  It is not only vintage with no sound but music AND it is a railroad theme which was perfect when debuted during the Train Show this month.  All loved it and over 800 + were in attendance.",1424476800,2,414,4.282051282051282
