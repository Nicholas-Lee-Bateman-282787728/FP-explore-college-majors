442248,5,6302260973,"Still one of my all time favorite movies (and soundtracks that unfortunately is really only still available on vinyl). The role that O'Toole says he ""fought"" for -- and for good reason. This is the movie that, without question, he should have won an Oscar for. When you watch it and love it, the story of how the film was made and the botch of its distribution is well worth researching;it was mis-promoted, mishandled, misplaced.  It's about movie making, about war, but most of all, about paranoia -- the ""social disease"" it faultlessly dissects.  The only time that I ever saw a movie, then turned around and paid to see it again at the next showing, and again at the next (and if there had been another that day, I'd have done it again). A mind-blowing delight. Again, again and again. And then see: https://www.amazon.com/Sinister-Saga-Making-Stunt-Man/dp/B00005OCK8",1489881600,2,871,5.0

442282,4,6302260973,"This is great Peter O'Toole in his ""I'm going to do what I want and I don't give a &^%$ phase"".  You get the feeling that the director just yelled ""action"" and let Peter do what he wanted.  And he's really good.  And Barbara Hershey!  You might only remember her from Hoosiers, and it's easy to forget what a looker she was.  Well, she's so damn  beautiful in this flick, it's worth the price of admission right there.  Good story, good performances, and a brief reminder of what movies looked like in the 1970's (before CGI and flash over substance)",1449446400,,550,4.44

442287,5,6302260973,"""The Player"" seems to be considered the go-to film about the film industry, possibly because so many dozens of big-name actors appeared in it. To a point, I agree that it does shed some light on an oft-misunderstood industry. To a lesser extent ""Barton Fink"" (a small-timer trying to make it in the olden days) and ""The Artist"" (how the industry operated during more imaginative days) are also pretty informative films about how matters are sorted outside the view of the public concerning film, but you could also apply it (to an extent) to other aspects of entertainment.

""The Stunt Man"" easily trumps all, but deceptively so. The reason why I say ""deceptively,"" is mainly because the film is given a slightly campy overlay that contributes to the whirl of activity surrounding the making of the film. At the eye of this storm is director Eli Cross, played perfectly (as usual) by Peter O'Toole. O'Toole is depicted on most publicity posters for this film as satan and for good reason. Cross manipulates every angle and aspect of the film he is making and takes the extra step of delving into motivating and tempting the actors off screen as well. In other words, what he ""wants"" to get out of them, he achieves. He gets them to do it, no matter how corrupting it is to their morals, no matter how recklessly-dangerous it is to their safety and no matter how far over line he must prod producers to go budget-wise.

Yes, ""The Stunt Man"" is a deceptively-accurate look into what the most highly acclaimed directors do to get the most out of their cast & crew.",1439942400,4,1561,4.6521739130434785

442322,3,6302260973,"Okay---so I rated it merely ""Okay,"" but nonetheless you should watch it if only to see Peter O'Toole in action, how he is a control freak, a gamesman, a conniver.

THE STUNT MAN: ""If God could do the tricks that we can do, He'd be a happy man!"" proclaims Eli Cross--a film director reputedly based on John Huston (who, perhaps not coincidentally, played a character named ""Noah Cross"" in Chinatown a few years earlier). Like Huston, director Eli engages in shameless manipulation, pushes everyone to the edge, and gets away with murder--here, perhaps literally.

Eli's philosophy is that reality depends on your point of view--as long as it's his. The film follows his lead, daring us to guess whether it's ""real"" real or ""reel"" real. There's plenty of comic action in the film-within-the-film, the occasional brilliant line, intense emotional revelations, levels of deception that add depth to everyone's story, and a number of flagrant ""fooled-ya"" stunt sequences to feed our need for illusion and belief.",1421712000,,1102,4.951351351351351

The film is about an eccentric and idealistic filmmaker (O'Toole) who sets out to make an anti-war movie in the years following Vietnam through the use of drama, satire and tragedy. His character is conflicted, unappreciated, at times, egocentric and insane and one never knows to just what degree he would go to illustrate his point through the eyes of an eccentric and creative artist. he is often misunderstood, shunned and yet admired and loved all throughout the film. His relationship with the stunt man is at times one of mentor and pupil as well as two strangers who speak very different languages (figuratively) and try to find a common ground.

Peter O'Toole is delicious as Eli, the movie director, who may be evil or good, or just plain playful. A young military veteran (Steve Railsback) who probably has untreated PTSD, is on the run from the law after an incident in an ice cream store.  He ends up amid the filming of a WWI morality tale. Eli hires him to replace a stuntman who was accidentally killed on the set.  As a stuntman, he doesn't know if he will live to see another day.  He has become romantically involved with Eli's former girlfriend and female lead in the movie, played by Barbara Hershey.  He thinks that Eli will kill him during a car stunt on a bridge because of his romantic poaching.  Will he or won't he?  It's worth the viewing to discover.",1403654400,,812,4.409395973154362

442385,5,6302260973,"THE STUNT MAN [1980] [Blu-ray] A Virtuoso Piece Of Moviemaking! Peter OToole Gives A Peerless Comic Performance!

It defied all odds to become the most unexpected and acclaimed cult hit of the 80s, and it remains one of the most slyly subversive and thrillingly original action/comedy/drama motion pictures of all time. The legendary Peter OToole in his iconic Oscar nominated performance stars as director Eli Cross, a deliciously megalomaniacal madman commanding a film-set circus where a paranoid young veteran [Steve Railsback] finds himself maybe replacing a dead stunt man, possibly falling for the beautiful leading lady [Barbara Hershey], and discovering that love, death and the mayhem of moviemaking can definitely be the wildest illusions of all. THE STUNT MAN now features a stunning High Definition transfer supervised by Oscar nominated Producer/Director Richard Rush, plus new interviews and commentaries with Rush, Peter OToole, Steve Railsback and Alex Rocco, all in the ultimate edition of the classic that the Los Angeles Times calls as innovative today as Citizen Kane was in its time! ""If God could do the tricks that we can do, he'd be a happy man.""

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Cameron [Steve Railsback] didn't exactly have stars in his eyes when he broke into the film industry. No, he was instead simply on the run from the cops. Why...? That's a story for later, seeing as how he's too busy darting through the woods to talk about that quite yet. Just when Cameron thinks he's in the clear, some sixty-something-year-old sedan car, a relic from World War One tries to run him down? In a fit of desperation, Cameron sends the car careening off the bridge, and both it and the driver trapped inside plummet deep, deep, deep into the water below. When a helicopter soars upward a fraction of a second later, Cameron fully expects that the police have caught up to him, but...no. Inside are a smartly dressed British director and a massive 35mm camera. Eli Cross [Peter O'Toole] is in town filming his WWI epic, and completely fascinated by this wild young man, he sees an opportunity. Eli knows this fugitive wants to keep out of sight, and what better place to hide than among a sprawling film crew? A quick shave, a job title, and the word of an authoritarian director ought to silence any suspicions. Of course, Cameron's going to have to earn his keep. The shoot is down one stunt man, thanks to him, so who better to fill the vacancy than Cam? At first, everything appears to be going swimmingly. Cameron ducked tracer fire in Vietnam for two years straight, so squibs and jumps and rolls don't have him breaking a sweat. Cameron is clearly the teacher's pet, he has a gorgeous starlet by the name of Nina Franklin [Barbara Hershey] writhing all over him, and he gets $600 a pop for every stunt he pulls off. The only thing is that he starts to feel less like a stunt man on the set of a multimillion motion picture and more like a guinea pig being nudged through some deranged scientist's maze. As the lines between reality and illusion continue to blur, Cameron can't quite shake the feeling that Eli Cross is trying to capture his death on film.

THE STUNT MAN defies description. Like so many of the greatest films hailing from the 1970s, it's a collision of the commercial and wildly artistic. Someone who was only halfway paying attention could still take THE STUNT MAN as a popcorn film, with soldiers frantically exchanging gunfire, dogfights mid-air, dizzyingly acrobatic leaps, cars careening off bridges, a couple of sex scenes, even more explosions, and an honest-to-God love interest for good measure. It's a film at least in part about the stuntmen who risk life and limb to make movies feel like such an adrenaline rush and jumping open drawbridges, Tarzan like swinging from a vine...you know the song, so of course it's thrilling in its own right. THE STUNT MAN is infused with a manic energy that never relents, propelled further by an outstanding score, a wicked sense of humour, a brilliant cast led by the legendary Peter O'Toole, and endlessly quotable dialogue. Nothing about THE STUNT MAN fits cleanly into any prefabricated box. Is it a comedy? A drama? An action flick? Well...yes and all that and more.

Virtually every moment throughout THE STUNT MAN unfolds through Cameron's eyes, someone from the outside whose thrust in the middle of this insanity and the audience is right there with him, every bit as disoriented as he is. There is no clear distinction between illusion and reality. Cameron never knows if his life is truly in danger or if it's all part of the show. Perspectives shift wildly. One moment, Cameron may be doing the Charleston however many thousands of feet in the air on the wing of a biplane, with the full ascent documented and Eli Cross following close behind in a helicopter, and then the camera will pull back to show he's on a carefully wired rig a dozen or so feet off the ground. Reality is so fluid throughout THE STUNT MAN film that is not possible to get a firm grasp on it, and that's one of the most incredible things about the film. You're never ahead of the movie. You, the audience, are also at the mercy of a masterfully manipulative storyteller. Richard Rush bombards the screen with one strange, surreal, hyperkinetic, explosive set piece after another, and the many allusions drawn to Alice in Wonderland throughout are wholly deserved. Simply put, THE STUNT MAN stands strong as one of the most ambitious, uncompromising, and devilishly clever films ever made.

THE STUNT MAN approaches a career best for Peter O'Toole, which, for an actor of his stature, is saying something. He portrays Eli Cross as a god of sorts. The film set is a world of his creation, and to the cast and crew that march in lockstep with his every command, Eli Cross's word is Holy Scripture. He's often in a different plane than the rest of the cast of THE STUNT MAN, often descending from the heavens in a crane that doesn't appear to be attached to anything. Every utterance of Peter O'Toole's is unforgettable, and the balance he strikes between impishly charming and understatedly terrifying is outstanding. Steve Railsback is inspired casting in the part of a man being driven mad by Eli Cross's machinations. Just a couple years before cameras rolled, Steve Railsback had starred as Charles Manson in Helter Skelter, and few actors can play raving and unhinged as skilfully as he can. Barbara Hershey is alluring and elusive as an actress who's spent so much of her young life pretending to be other people that she doesn't know who she is or what she wants. The list goes on from there.

In the same way that the character Cameron is never really sure he can trust what he's seeing, I'm having a hard time believing that The Stunt Man truly has found its way to Blu-ray. For a film with three key Academy Awards nominations, endless critical praise, and a rabidly fierce fan base, THE STUNT MAN isn't the easiest film to wrap one's hands around. It never escaped into more than a handful of cinemas in America. Even close to a full decade after the film finally hit the Anchor Bay DVD, and that's with a hundred thousand copies in circulation. SEVERIN Films knows how much hunger there is for THE STUNT MAN and not only have they brought this brilliant film to the awesome Blu-ray format, but they've put together a definitive release to go along with it. Essentially all of the extras from the limited edition Anchor Bay DVD set have been carried over; including an audio commentary and a feature-length documentary and SEVERIN Films has also assembled close to two hours' worth of new extras as well. Very, very highly recommended!

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE STUNT MAN isn't glossy, gleaming high definition eye candy, but if it were, that'd mean something went terribly wrong. This Blu-ray disc is gloriously grainy, just as it should be. Aside from a few scattered soft shots that date back to the original photography, the presentation is so much sharper and more teeming with detail than I waltzed in expecting to see. There's some speckling, sure, but its light enough not to distract all that much. There's no trace of edge enhancement or excessive noise reduction. Its palette is much punchier than that faded inferior DVD from a decade back, and contrast is more robust as well, not looking quite so soupy and thin. SEVERIN Films Blu-ray disc also exposes a little bit more information. Instead of me just talking about how much better the THE STUNT MAN looks in high definition compared to Anchor Bay's limited edition DVD, then you must purchase the Blu-ray disc to find out for yourself. The significant change in colour timing could be a little controversial, but for whatever my vote's worth, the saturation on the Blu-ray disc looks better to my eyes. The disc's packaging confirms that the transfer was supervised by Richard Rush as well, so clearly it has the director's thumbs-up. If there's one misstep that SEVERIN Films has made here, it's up converting a couple hours worth of standard definition extras to 1080i. That needlessly gobbles up a lot of space that a film this gritty and grainy really needs. To make room for the pointlessly up converted extras, the 131 minute film is rendering of the film grain suffers as a result. I can't help but think more adept compression may have brought out at least a little more detail as well. For a case-in-point, look at how the grain clumps together and looks so excessively digital in the screenshot below.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Though the only soundtrack on this Blu-ray disc is a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio remix, it's respectful to the original sound design. The mix is weighted towards the front speakers, with effects like police sirens, whirring helicopter blades, biplanes soaring overhead, a sudden rush of water, and why not? Nazi-era chanting spilling into the surrounds. The pans across the soundstage aren't completely silky smooth, but they're effective enough. Bass response is solid when called for, such as the rumble of a motorcade and more than a couple of explosions. The score by Dominic Frontiere sounds particularly impressive, rendered with a fidelity and robustness that I never would've expected to hear. Dialogue and other sound effects don't pack quite as much of a wallop, but they emerge well enough. It does seem that the dialogue is dialled a touch lower in the mix than I would've liked, although I can't say I ever missed a line. This is a worthy remix and a strong showing overall.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with writer-director Richard Rush, along with stars Peter O'Toole, Steve Railsback, Barbara Hershey, Alex Rocco, Sharon Farrell and Chuck Bail: This THE STUNT MAN commentary track is a little easy to miss since it's only listed under ""Audio Setup"" and isn't mentioned at all under ""Extras."" It is well-worth those extra couple of clicks, though, showcasing a massive array of talent: Richard Rush, Peter O'Toole, Steve Railsback, Barbara Hershey, Alex Rocco, Sharon Farrell, and Chuck Bail. The commentary is pieced together from several different sessions, but there's still a good bit of interaction between the different speakers. There are no shortage of highlights here, including why the bookending classic car footage is sped up, Rush filming other people filming, unbeknown to them, which of the many directors Peter O'Toole has worked with over the years bears the greatest similarity to Eli Cross, director Richard Rush doubling as a hairdresser, the title of the film-within-a-film, and paying guests staying at the resort where planes were swooping down from overhead and WWI soldiers were shooting everything to holy hell. This audio commentary is overflowing with personality, and it's such an infectiously fun listen and well-worth setting aside the time to hear this superb audio commentary.

Special Feature: The Sinister Saga: The Making of The Stunt Man [114 minutes] Don't think of The Sinister Saga as an extra; instead, look at this Blu-ray disc as a double feature. A lot of making-of documentaries are content to just aim cameras at talking heads, but Richard Rush is too visually inventive and has far too keen a sense of humour to settle for that. Rush is very much the star of his own film this time around, and he's constantly on the move as he tells the story of how THE STUNT MAN came together, be it zooming up a towering glass elevator, running 35mm film through the projector in his screening room, revisiting the resort where so much of the film was shot, or soaring however many tens of thousands of feet up in the air. The Documentary is teeming with crackling clever transitions, and rather than just cut away to an excerpt from THE STUNT MAN, he'll...oh, I don't know, overlay it on the wing of an airplane. The Sinister Saga is just such a blast to watch, and it's made even better by the fact that the story that the documentary tells is every bit as fascinating. Richard Rush does a tremendous job setting the stage: an era where the concept of making a film about a stunt man was unfathomable, and where no studio in town wanted to bite on a project as uncommercial as that novel One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest he'd also gotten the rights to produce. Screenwriting, financing, casting, and the score are all explored in great detail...and always with several intriguingly insane stories to go along with them. Those walls being knocked down by the WWI-era tank...? That's the M-G-M back lot as it was prepped for demolition. All of the key members of the cast get a chance to contribute too, including Peter O'Toole who notes that a madman like Eli Cross wouldn't last a minute in this industry. Rush delves into how he pioneered what'd go on to be known as rack focus, his struggles with producers hell-bent on sabotaging THE STUNT MAN, and how changes in the business made lining up a distributor so nightmarish, and how he ultimately had to shoulder so much of the film's promotion himself. The Sinister Saga might have been the first feature-length making-of documentary I'd ever watched when I first saw it ten years ago, and even with the thousand or so reviews I've churned out in the decade since, I don't think I've ever come across another one that can touch it as this is totally essential viewing.

Special Feature: The Maverick Career of Richard Rush [1080p] [34:00] Director Richard Rush delves in impressive detail into every one of the movies in his filmography, including making his debut with the teen abortion film Too Soon to Love, calling in the Hell's Angels to fend off vengeful San Franciscan hippies during the production of Psych-Out, mashing together a biker flick and cowboys-and-Indians with The Savage Seven, and his press war that spun out of the debacle with The Color of Night. It's not a straight ahead career retrospective, and Rush has a knack for finding at least one fascinating, completely unexpected story to tell about each of the films he's helmed over the years.

Special Feature: Peter O'Toole Recounts THE STUNT MAN [1080p] [19:00] I'm sure it goes without saying that by far the highlight of the newly-produced extras is this interview with Peter O'Toole. He weaves a number of tremendous stories while looking back on THE STUNT MAN, including how getting the boot from his girlfriend put him on the path to starring in Richard Rush's film, the crossroads he was at as a middle-aged actor, mimicking an oblivious Richard Rush on the set while bringing the character of Eli Cross to life, pulling a prank on an actor who dozed off in the middle of the shoot, and how torrential rain and impatient producers threatened the filming of the films bookending sequences.

Special Feature: Devil's Squadron: An Interview with Steve Railsback and Alex Rocco [1080p] [19:00] Real-life best friends Steve Railsback and Alex Rocco met on the set of The Stunt Man, and the two of them tell stories of Peter O'Toole reciting hyper vulgar renditions of Shakespeare to ducks, a symphony of dicks that once caught Steve Railsback off-guard on the other side of the camera, the huge names that Richard Rush turned down in favour of his preferred cast, a prank Rush pulled on the producers to show how serious he was about keeping his final cut, and the incredible critical reception of the film. Being such close friends and all, Steve Railsback and Alex Rocco also poke a lot of good-hearted fun at each other and talk about what their friendship has meant over the years.

Special Feature: Barbara Hershey on Nina Franklin [1080p] [14:00] This terrific conversation with Barbara Hershey begins with a discussion about what makes THE STUNT MAN in general and the character of Nina in particular so uniquely intriguing. Hershey dissects Nina as best anyone can for a character that in so many ways is elusive, and she also marvels about working alongside Peter O'Toole, particularly a genuine burst of emotion that was captured on film.

Special Feature: The Stunt Man at the New Beverly [1080p] [17:00] Following a screening of the film, Richard Rush, Steve Railsback, and Barbara Hershey field questions from the audience. The three of them speak about how faithful the finished film is to the original screenplay, whether or not Richard Rush and Eli Cross have all that much in common, the excruciatingly long process of lining up a distributor, what it's like to work alongside a living legend like Peter O'Toole, and how warmly European audiences received the film. The casting of 'THE STUNT MAN and the structure of its story are also discussed.

Deleted Scenes [1080p] [6:00] The first of The Stunt Man's two deleted scenes sees Eli slumping down on a pile of sand, his thumb in his mouth, while Sam gabs about how the once-brilliant screenplay he'd penned is losing its relevancy over time. The second scene has a gaggle of the film's crew turning a police station into a horn ball version of the Keystone Kops. It's worth noting that a third deleted scene is included exclusively as a part of The Sinister Saga of Making The Stunt Man.

Theatrical Trailers [1980] [1080p] Here included are the Teaser Trailer, Theatrical Trailer and Spanish Trailer of the Original Theatrical Trailers for the THE STUNT MAN.

SEVERIN Films Trailers [480i] Inglorious Bastards, Shopping and Santa Sangre [sadly they are all of such terrible quality].

Finally, in the end, THE STUNT MAN is a totally amazing entertaining examination of perception and paranoia of the film industry. To me it is the essential classic film of its genre and is definitely well worth purchasing. There is so much to enjoy. This film has extensive layers and seems to have been overlooked by some of the major critics as the delightful cornucopia of adventure/love/escape that it offers viewers. The movie-within-a-movie themes are explored in kind of an abstract way that end up being both amusing and addictive. It has 'cult status' written all over it. The Blu-ray is an impressive package. A lot of love went into this edition and it makes for a very desirable purchase. We endorse! That is why it has gone in pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection and is totally awesome for any collector of brilliant intelligent character driven films and has been a massive favourite of mine ever since I had the Anchor Bay Special Edition DVD and now having it in the Blu-ray format, has given me the ultimate edition and will always give me many hours of entertaining viewing. Very Highly Recommended!

It was originally released in 1980.  I saw it multiple times in a theater, then later bought the VHS version.  This DVD version is much more viewable and the audio is better.  Unfortunately, the director waited too long to record an interview with Peter O'Toole, who was 80 years old and quite feeble.  The interview should have been done when he was closer to the age of his character (46).  The movie has gained a following over the years of people who appreciate good movie-making.  It is still relevant, exciting and true-to-life.

I never see this film on TCM and I wonder why. Sir Peter O'Toole is the best at what he does, acting the hell out of his role. Barbara Hershey and Steve Railsback are marvelous supporting actors. They have a love relationship that's tough to get going. I didn't feel a strong chemistry between these two actors( I suspect because of O'Toole's menacing and immense presence), but compared to many so-called romantic relationships of today's movies, it was fine.

442437,5,6302260973,"As a former film industry professional ""The Stuntman"" has to be one of my all-time favorite movies, obviously. Already much has been said about Peter O'Toole's fantastic, even electric performance. There isn't anything else that I can add to this... other than I believe that secretly a lot of directors would like be like Eli Cross (including having Peter O'Toole's fabulous looks).

I watched ""The Stuntman"" seven times in 1980 - in the movie theater - right when it came out. I even own a VHS tape, which I will never give up, never mind what how technology will change during my lifetime. I am a true fan of the movie.

Over the years I realized why ""The Stuntman""  has become such an enormous success and cult movie. ""The Stuntman"" manipulates the viewer too. Indeed, the viewer becomes part of the plot. Eli Cross needs an audience at all times. From the silver screen or the TV set he manipulates the viewer into siding with the one or other supporting role, only to abandon that position five minute later, when we get manipulated in siding with somebody else.

It's a true master piece and the ultimate movie about making movies.

442461,5,6302260973,"A brilliant satire of the movie-making industry that doubles as a surreal comedy of errors, and a darned engaging adventure tale, as well.  One of the best ""what am I doing here?"" plots ever conceived.  It skillfully and humorously intertwines the plight of a runaway felon, the egos and issues of film actors and crew, and the problems an autocratic director has in realizing his vision of the ""ultimate anti-war movie"".  Unexpected laughs and surreal surprises just never seem to stop, and you're never really sure what the main character's fate will be until the last scene.

Some critics have compared this flick to Citizen Kane in terms of originality and scope, and for good reason-- there are really no others quite like it.  Like, say, Blade Runner, this flick is one of those lesser-known gems that has had a much broader influence in the film industry than its original release numbers would suggest. . . due to very lackluster studio promotion it was all but unnoticed when it was released in 1980.

Peter O'Toole is at his wildest and megalomaniacal best-- he received one of his many Oscar nominations for the role. Steve Railsback has never been better, and this is the movie that re-launched Barbara Hershey's career and helped her shed the ""hippie chick"" type-casting that had bogged her down in the 70's.  The film was also nominated for best director, and screenplay.  Incidentally, the complete screenplay is available on the DVD!

There are some sexy scenes, and a lot of faked but realistic violence, so it's not a film for young kids.  There is something here for almost any adult who loves a well-conceived and well-acted story, and this flick is a MUST for film aficionados, film students, stunt doubles, actors, and anyone who likes a rousing and amusing adventure.",1368230400,,1790,4.877887788778878

442463,4,6302260973,"This is a film that can't be classified in any genre or any kind of obvious formula. There's comedy, drama, action and social satire in the making of a Fellini type Hollywood WW1 production.

The plot is an ex-Vietnam vet fugitive on the run from a skirmish with the law and accidently kills a stuntman and finds himself taking the place of the dead stuntman on the movie production.

The movie deals with themes of illusion versus reality and the social desease of paranoia. Peter O'Toole as the God-like, over-the-top director with Jesus Christ elements to his character gives one of the great performances in cinema. This director will easily manipulate and embarass and bring down any cast or crew member that gets in the way of his deranged vision in the making of his film. Peter O'Toole's character, Eli Cross, flys around from God-like POV's, from his swooping helicopter and his large flying killer cranes, yelling God-like instructions from his booming megaphone.

This film has one of the most brilliant scores on it's soundtrack. It has a melodic carnival beat that's extremely infectious. By the end it's great filmmaking and one of the best cult films to come out in the 1980's.",1365724800,3,1192,4.862068965517241

Later Cameron is almost run down by a man in a car. The car falls over the edge of a bridge, killing its driver and Cameron makes his way to a film shoot and is subsequently taken in by the director who decides to use him as a stunt man to replace the now dead stunt man. Cameron is trained by Chuck, the stunt-coordinator and using his Vietnam experience quickly gets the hang of the industry. The filming of the movie continues but cameron realizes the cops are still looking for him. But that's not the worst of his problems. He suspects that Eli Cross (Played Magnificently By O'toole) is trying to kill him.

I won't ruin any more of oyur suspense. However, I will say this: This movie was a movie that gave us a lense into what goes on behind the scenes in movies. At the time this movie was released in 1980 this was a rarity. Any laymen watching this movie will be amazed at the effects and stunts that are shown.

My quibbles with the movie are these: Why did the man who drowned pick up Cameron in the first place. More to the point, why did he try to kill him? This was never explained and as a result I removed a Star from the film's rating. I would also have liked to learn what happened to Cameron. Did he escape the cops? If so, how? Did he get the $1000 bucks he demanded for his stun-which would have permitted him in 1980 to live on the lam a little longer-or did he have to continue working for Eli at the industry minimum of that time period? Did he get the girl? I wanted to know and as a result I will have to read the book to gain any answers that might exist.

The movie is produced and edited quite well. I'm proud to be the 76th person to make a review of this fine flick and the 13th to make a Four-Star review. Buy the DVD and you won't be disappointed.

When an escaped convict stumbles onto a movie set, a deranged filmmaker sees him as his ticket out of a jam.  Eccentric director Eli Cross has no regard for human life and so his constant pursuit of cinematic perfection has just cost the life of his key stuntman.  To avoid controversy he attempts to pass off Cameron, the convict, as the late stuntman and offers him his job.  Cameron changes his look and dons the dead man's duties and soon falls for the pictures leading lady, Nina.  Eli's madness soon takes hold over everyone on set, including Cameron, who begins to fear that Eli is actually trying to kill him.  Railsback is far too over the top, and he takes the films theatricality too far.  Faring far better are O'Toole and Hershey, who both show splashes of melodramatic theatrics yet understand how to keep their performances far more grounded in the film.

It was different from any film I had seen up to that point. I was more into science fiction at the time(ie. Star Wars, Blade Runner) I had never seen Peter O'Toole in anything really, so it was my first exposure to him as an actor. I had never seen Barbara Hershey in anything before either, then the next year she was in a movie called The Entity(which was disturbing) and I loved her in The Right Stuff. My mom, who loves to watch movies, did not like The Stunt Man. I guess it is an acquired taste. It was done in 1980 so there is a aspect of the film that has a ""Classic"" feel I guess. We are so sophisticated these days with modern cinema that sometimes we disregard older movies as being outdated. Everyone thinks that it was Richard Rush's best film, and they are probably right.

442492,3,6302260973,"""As innovative today as CITIZEN KANE was in its time""- Los Angeles Times. is the blurb on the front cover of the disc container. You can accept that if you like; I think it was probably the result of a series of meetings between the writers and the director out of which emerged an inchoate manuscript, from which the newest girl/boy in the typing pool, a film  major at UCLA, desperately put together the final shooting script. It really is an incoherent mess, salvaged only by some good stunts and over-the-top efforts, by a couple of talented stars and assorted, probably equally adept, supporting players. Of Steve Railsback, I know nothing, so I refrain from any credit or criticism. He may not have had much to do with how he came out on the screen.
As best I can figure out, an escaped prisoner, pursued by the police, was given sanctuary by an ego-maniacal director,  despite the fact that he had caused the death of one stuntman, which act, the director covered up, making himself, at the minimum, guilty of obstruction of justice, plus conspiring to protect a fugitive he knew to be wanted by local and federal authorities, and, probably, if past precedent in very dangerous stunts that went awry, involuntary manslaughter. (Not being a student of criminal law, these are not the exact terms for his acts, and many more he committed, Peter O'Toole played pretty much from his background with similar types of characters and Barbara Hershey certainly looked desirable.
However, as I said at the beginning, you, too, may believe it to be as innovative as Citizen Kane.
I should  point out that it is not the many criminal acts to which I objected, it is the lack of coherence, wit, sensibility, or meaningfulness.",1318896000,,1721,4.768456375838926

A Vietnam veteran, Cameron (Steve Railsback) is on the run with the justice, due his troubled mind leads him to an involuntary  murder attempt. Since this incident, he becomes an outlaw and begins to run away.

It's just in a bridge when the criss cross happens. A stunt man higly excited pursues the outer reality and intends to run over him : since this twist of fate appears, makes Cameron assumes his role, crossing the border to get into the fiction : a movie about the war, whose director Eli Cross feels himself like a Deux Ex machine inside his field.

Robert Bresson was right when affirmed that to direct a film is like being a general in the battlefield. Eli Cross is like ""The Big Brother"" in 1984, scrutinizing every single detail around the backstage and considering his staff must be watched night and day. So, this outrageous behavior is what it sets out the following question: Is the insanity a part of the creative freedom? This ruling personage tries to capture the essential expression, the visceral emotion without masks, showing us the pretended sanity of the outer world may never be ahead the goal of cinema.

Of course, the vast spectre of the language of cinema is there: drama, intrigue, comedy, double cross, love affairs and minor scandals that integrate the whole picture.

So, we are before the best American film since it was released. And with the honorable exception of these five films (except Fellini's Casanova, Good morning Babylon in the past and Brazil, Sex, lies and video and Zentropa) the fragmentation and dissolution had never been so magnificenly exposed and better expressed than ""The Stunt man.""

It's useless to affirm, my worthy reader this a masterpiece from start to finish. An eternal cult movie since its immediate release.",1313712000,4,2085,4.923076923076923
442495,5,6302260973,"It's called 'subjective reality', children. The fact that the truth depends on the angle you happen to be watching from gives us all our unique, if skewed and unfair, perception on life. We're all puppets in someone else's dastardly play and we never know when that person, that entity, that divine being will cut our strings.

This was director Richard Rush's dream project and it took him nine years to get it on the screen. And, of course, it would! It's multi-layered, original, funny and packed full of story and circumstance that makes you think. Why would any studio want to touch it? Fox even sat on it for two years before giving it a limited release. Even on its umpteenth viewing it delivers again and again, offering new angles and subtle clues.

The viewpoint of this metafictional masterpiece is Cameron (Steve Railsback), a Vietnam vet on the run from the law. He stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie and accidentally kills a stunt driver. The director of the movie is the eccentric and megalomaniacal Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole, in one of his best ever performances), who takes Cameron under his wing and protects him from John Law, as long as he keeps his mouth shut about the accident.

Cameron practices to be a stunt man and takes the place of the man he killed. But as the movie shoot becomes more elaborate and dangerous, he falls in love with the leading lady (Barbara Hershey) and starts to suspect that Eli is trying to capture his death on film.

Although it seems nasty, the movie is wonderfully light-hearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by an awesome score by Dominic Frontiere. I've been humming that theme since I was 12-years-old when I taped it off Channel 4 in December 1992. I didn't quite get it back then, but I nearly wore out that VHS watching it over and over. A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop, as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase, is pure joy. There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other, fall off, and get blown up.

John Law do not back down on their suspicion of Eli and, through half-heard conversations and eavesdropping, Cameron's paranoia becomes increasingly justified. Because the movie is seen through his eyes we never quite know what is going on with Eli. Is he a madman, or just a crafty director? Would you believe that Peter O'Toole based his performance on his experiences with David Lean? Why he never won an Oscar (it went to Robert DeNiro for Raging Bull)- is beyond me. He truly gives the performance of his career, far exceeding even Laurence of Arabia. It also sucks that Rush never won for Director, or Adapted Screenplay. Had he been awarded the golden statuette, maybe he would have received more recognition. He's clearly a better filmmaker than most of today's hack artists.

You simply have to see The Stunt Man. It's an overlooked gem and, despite the wide praise it received, it has never really reached a large audience. Now is definitely the time to rediscover this forgotten classic.

The Blu Ray presents the film in 1.85:1 108p HD. The print has just a tiny amount of dings and scratches but it's otherwise fin, and aside from a few grainy shots in several scenes the film's slick, high-key photography looks stunning. The DTS HD-MA sound makes sure all the explosions and Frontiere's boisterous score have never sounded better. Extras are certainly plentiful. The BD is NOT region-locked either.",1313366400,6,3448,4.717607973421927

442497,4,6302260973,"What an odd career director Richard Rush has had.  He ground out several low budget exploitation pictures in the 1960's with titles like TOO SOON TO LOVE, HELLS ANGELS ON WHEELS and PSYCH-OUT (the latter two featuring pre-fame Jack Nicholson), primarily through Samuel Arkoff's American International Pictures.  His 1970 movie, GETTING STRAIGHT starring Elliot Gould, was one of many undistinguished, studio-driven youth-rebellion flicks of the day.  And Rush's 1974 cop-buddy comedy, FREEBIE AND THE BEAN with Alan Arkin and James Caan, was a mid-level programmer for Warner Brothers.

But when Richard Rush shuffles off to that great director's chair in the sky, he can pretty much rest assured that the movie he will be remembered for is his 1980 tour de force, THE STUNT MAN.  (It probably won't be 1994's THE COLOR OF NIGHT, the only feature he has subsequently directed.)

THE STUNT MAN weaves the contemporary tale of Cameron (Steve Railsback), an escaped convict eluding some not very diligent police, who stumbles upon a movie company shooting a World War I film in and around San Diego's famous Hotel del Coronado.  The film-within-the-film is helmed by the megalomaniac director, Eli Cross, fabulously played by the great Peter O'Toole in one of his signature roles.  With the movie's primary stunt double killed in an accident (which Cameron might have partly caused), Eli recruits the runaway con/Vietnam vet to become the leading actor's stunt man.  Cameron's immediate infatuation with the beautiful Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the lead actress in the movie, further entangles him in behind-the-scenes intrigue.

An under-the-radar movie upon its release, THE STUNT MAN was helped by some key critical recognition, most notably by The New Yorker's Pauline Kael, probably the most influential film writer at the time.  A modest financial hit, it went on to garner three Oscar nominations for Best Actor (O'Toole), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence B. Marcus and Rush).

THE STUNT MAN is designed to work on several levels, and for the most part, pulls it off.  First, it's a movie about movies.  Rush takes great cinematic joy in presenting the inner workings, both mechanical and psychological, of a movie company, circa 1979.  Having worked on many film sets around that time, I can attest that, for the most part, he gets it right.  It's also a film about identity, power and control.  And in a world devoted to creating illusion, the question hanging over all of THE STUNT MAN... What is real and what isn't?

But while Richard Rush flirts with all of these themes in THE STUNT MAN, he never digs deep beneath the surface of any one of them.  They are there to entertain, and they do.  Just like Rush's direction.  He seems to be having so much fun finding ways to keep his movie visually engaging and mildly oblique, that we are happy to go along for the ride.",1312156800,2,2902,5.004166666666666

Some scenes come off as sloppy, especially the one where Steve Railsback and Barbara Hershey are stumbling around with paint cans near the end.  But Peter O'Toole is great as the maniacal director who'll do anything to get his film made, even if he's also completely burned out and jaded by the process.

But I wondered why the main character was played so crazy.  Steve Railsback's expressions are so wired and crazy that I had hard time sympathizing with him.  All these years later, it just comes across as overacting.  Was it another goof from the director on the audience?

The performances are uniformly excellent. O'Toole is truly magnetic here, and you can see that he was hammered in some scenes and still pulls it off. Now that's a pro drinker! Railsback is perfect, and Hershey is mighty alluring indeed. This is the inside look at film-making that Hollywood doesn't want us to see: the egos, the drugs (watch the t-shirts and background scenes), the general insular idiocy of it all, and mainly the non-stop irony.

My only quibble is that it could be about 15 minutes shorter; it drags a bit at about 90 minutes in, and some of the shots linger a little too self-satisfiedly long, showing that even Rush was not immune to director's disease.

Nonetheless, SM is so brilliant in so many ways, and the script so tight, that this is truly a classic film. Could never figure why it didn't get the acclaim it deserved, but then again the market for truth has never been too huge.

442580,5,6302260973,"By 1980, the year THE STUNT MAN was released, Peter O'Toole and his peers -- that infamous troupe of besotted British actors which included Richard Burton, Robert Shaw and Richard Harris -- were considered anachronisms by Hollywood. Fast living had aged them beyond their years, but more to the point, these classically trained Europeans, their mannered acting styles designed to project to the last rows of the Old Vic, seemed hopelessly dated compared with the introspective naturalism of America's latest generation of rising Method actors, led by De Niro. For the most part, this lot was best remembered by American audiences for their historical costume dramas and World War II epics of the '60s -- the kinds of films nobody was making anymore.

For O'Toole in particular, the glory days of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA were long gone -- his screen work had recently included TV movies and the big-screen abomination CALIGULA. THE STUNT MAN, an ambitious black comedy about filmmaking and paranoia, resurrected O'Toole's career and garnered him his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination. The irony in this is that O'Toole's comic performance as a half-mad movie director willing to risk everything to finish his film is quite purposely based on the same flamboyant dramatics that marked the actor as old-world and out of date.

O'Toole's Eli Cross has three days to wrap his antiwar film, with both his ego and his career on the line, and so he slows for nothing, not even the accidental death of a stunt man. (Real-life directors have gone as far in pursuit of their goals.) In creating his character, O'Toole has mixed in touches of such directing legends as John Huston and David Lean, for whom he had worked. But Cross is no mere parody. Rather, Cross plays as a composite of Peter O'Toole's greatest hits: there are shades of Henry II, head of that ancient English dysfunctional family, whom O'Toole had played to perfection in both BECKET and THE LION IN WINTER. Well aware of the aptness of the director-as-king metaphor, O'Toole invests Cross with Henry's regal magnetism -- part warrior, part diplomat, part schemer.

But in another sly stroke of insight, O'Toole draws even more heavily on his role as Jack, the paranoid schizophrenic nobleman who's certain he's Jesus Christ in THE RULING CLASS. Standing on a lofty perch above his cast and crew, Cross booms out in a voice that needs no megaphone: ""We must have this shot!... I thereby order that no camera shall jam, and no cloud pass before the sun!"" O'Toole grins crookedly -- he knows Cross is only half-serious -- but he plays his megalomaniacal director as a man who wants his crew to believe he is the closest thing to a deity they're likely to meet. ""If God could do the tricks we can do, he'd be a happy man,"" Cross insists, and it's O'Toole's delivery, brimming with a crazed self-confidence, that makes this the film's tag line.

O'Toole makes Cross larger than life, a screen presence whose hypnotic charm, more than his temper, reputation or title, is the true key to the manipulative power he wields. ""I can't figure it out,"" says one character, an on-the-lam criminal whom Cross seduces into replacing the dead stunt man and risking his life on a movie set, ""I can't take my eyes off the son of a bitch."" It is an apt description of Cross the director, and a fitting tribute to O'Toole the actor, who roused himself from career torpor for one glorious performance which, in recalling the best moments of a bygone era, proved how compulsively watchable an old ham can be.",1210464000,3,3538,4.823723228995058

442584,3,6302260973,"I've been informed many times that I should watch this film. To save an argument, I put it in the DVD player. While watching it, I did feel it was a little too long, and some scenes could have been cut so easily, but it's one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. I think with a couple more viewings I could understand it more fully, and I don't think anyone will every FULLY understand on the first viewing.

But what you get is one of the most innovative and lesser known movies around. While the 80s were full of the Rat Pack, and high school movies, this one may have slightly slipped under the radar, and has become, judging by some of the reviews, what can only be described as a cult classic.

Peter O'Toole gives a great Oscar worthy performance (he was robbed!) as the egomanical director of a WW1 film, who will do absolutely anything, perhaps even murder someone, in order to protect his film. He'll do whatever is necessary to get a precious shot and the viewer feels like he needs to know where his motives lie. You see him place his lead character, Cameron, in many different stunts, each one more dangerous than the other, including the most memorable one, running across the rooftops, being chased. You do get the feeling the director wants to capture death on film, and since Cameron killed (and replaced) the other stuntman, he kinda owes the director a favour. I didn't like Cameron that much, but it wasn't him, it was after he dyed his hair, he reminded me so much of a guy I knew at school, I found it very difficult to watch him.

I think perhaps why this movie never got the attention it deserved, is because how on earth do you categorise it? It could fit under so many different film genres that it's difficult to describe the film in any sense making way. Especially, in a review, which I've had so much trouble writing.

What I found difficult about this film was the perspective it was told from. It's told from the perspective of Cameron, but it's NOT always his point of view, and my head was spinning after a while trying to keep up with it all. It does take some patience to watch it and understand it. What also put some people off is that it took a mere nine years to get to screen and even then it only got a limited release. This limited edition DVD is packed with extras, although it did remind me more of a video cassette case, rather than the slimline DVD that is out there now.

It's definitely a film worth picking out, if you're tired of the same old rom-coms, horror movies and action movies. This is a movie with a difference.",1172880000,2,2582,4.35966735966736

You get a glimpse of the art of stunts and the director's callous attitude towards stuntmen.  The director is the star of a war epic that has little to do with reality.  His skewered vision of war and his approach towards directing his epic go leaps and bounds beyond reality.  This film has a fine cast of characters that give some gravitas towards the story.

442586,4,6302260973,"It's easy to see why The Stunt Man has stayed around so long and developed a devoted cult following - it's great fun.  Richard Rush has created an amusing hall of mirrors that relies on the very essence of film - illusion.  Of course, here there are layers of illusion and we're not exactly sure of who is in on the joke and when they've figured it out, which makes it that much more entertaining.

While it's inadvisable for writers to write about writers, and for filmmakers to make movies about making movies, it can be done.  Serious students of film looking for deep meaning and symbolism should bypass The Stunt Man altogether and go straight to Truffaut's Day For Night, an extraordinary bit of cinema that blurs the line between celluloid artifice and reality brilliantly, using one to inform the other.  I like to think Mr. Rush did not have such lofty goals in mind for The Stunt Man.  For him, the - What is real? - question is merely a device to advance plot and maintain interest, which it most certainly does.

The improbability factor in The Stunt Man is very high; the picture is made plausible and held together through the offices of Peter O'Toole, whose performance is absolutely perfect.  O'Toole is an amazing actor; as director Eli Cross he is megalomaniacal, nearly mad, vain, narcissistic, staggeringly manipulative, and at least a little bit brilliant, in short, close to the popular image of a real director.  While it is easy to focus on his puppet-master control of all events, there are many scenes revealing how he fears the various disasters that may befall his project, not the least of which being his ability to lead.

The Stunt Man for whom the picture is named, Cameron, is played amateurishly by Steve Railsback.  (This may explain the long list of movies no one has seen on Mr. Railback's bio.)  It doesn't matter, everyone else in the cast is so good, especially Barbara Hershey, that the film easily survives the damage Mr. Railsback inflicts.  Indeed, it would be worth seeing the picture just to witness the innumerable nameless stuntmen at work, absolutely great.  Not a picture for the art house, this one's for the fun house.

Why would any studio want to touch it? Fox even sat on it for two years before giving it a limited release. Now, Anchor Bay has created the ultimate DVD and I urge you to buy it. The Stunt Man is a movie you'll never forget and even on its umpteenth viewing, still manages to be as intriguing as the first.

It is a story told from the view of Cameron (Steve Railsback), a Vietnam vet on the run from the law. He stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie and accidentally kills a stunt driver. The director of the movie is the eccentric and megalomaniacal Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole, in one of his best ever performances), who takes Cameron under his wing and protects him from John Law, as long as he keeps his mouth shut about the accident.

Cameron practices to be a stunt artist and takes the place of the man he killed. But as the movie shoot becomes more elaborate and dangerous, he falls in love with the leading lady (Barbara Hershey) and starts to suspect that Eli is trying to capture his death on film.

Although it seems nasty, the movie is wonderfully light-hearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by a joyous score by Dominic Frontiere. I've been humming that theme since I was 12-years-old. A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop, as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase, is the stuff of legend. There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other, fall off and get blown up.

John Law do not back down on their suspicion of Eli and, through half-heard conversations and eavesdropping, Cameron's paranoia becomes increasingly justified. Because the movie is seen through his eyes we never quite know what is going on with Eli. Is he a madman, or just a crafty director? Would you believe that O'Toole based his performance on his experiences with David Lean?

Why he never won an Oscar - it went to Robert DeNiro for Raging Bull - is beyond me. He truly gives the performance of his career, far exceeding even Laurence of Arabia. It also sucks that Rush never won for Director, or Adapted Screenplay. Had he been awarded the golden statuette, maybe he would have received more recognition. He's clearly a better filmmaker than most of today's hack artists.

You simply have to see The Stunt Man. It's an overlooked gem and, despite the wide praise it received, it has never really reached a large audience. Now is definitely the time to rediscover this forgotten classic.

Filmed in standard widescreen, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture exhibits varying degrees of quality. Some scenes are a bit grainy and a tad awkward, while others are clear, with beautiful blue skies and fleshtones. Even the soft-focus scenes still retain a golden shine to them. It may not be perfect and consistent, but it's a good transfer, considering the source material.

Taken from the original mono tracks and fully remastered, the Dolby/DTS 6.1 soundtracks are fantastic. The awesome score comes through with full force and takes over the soundfield. Deep bass is reserved for explosions and the rumble of car engines. Dialogue is still mono in nature, but a good deal of surround effects, such as circling helicopters and planes, make the soundfield come alive. Certainly not up to the standards of modern soundtracks, such as Superman Returns or X-Men III, but still the best The Stunt Man will ever sound.

There is a Commentary taken from long interviews with the participants. Some of them speak together and interact with each other, but you can easily tell that the track has been edited to make a whole, rather than one continuous session. But it's a great track, full of info and stories. Usually, I hate listening to commentaries, but this one is cool.

The 114 minute documentary, The Sinister Sage Of Making The Stunt Man, is directed and hosted by Rush as he explains every single (of many) problems he encountered from absolute beginning to absolute end. This is a movie in itself and features so many difficulties similar to those Eli Cross had to deal with and with just as much irony and tragic studio decisions as the WW I movie within The Stunt Man. It really is an interesting back-up story about what is happening on the flip side of reality. Or fiction. Depending on the angle you're watching from.

442634,5,6302260973,"Barbara Hershey delivers that line (above) very early in THE STUNT MAN, and she is saying a great deal. She is the old lady who magically transforms into a beautiful young woman, the fantasy, the dream girl at the end of the rainbow. She is the reason we go to the movies.

This is a work of art about the creation of a work of art. The work in this case happens to be a movie, and--as with all great works of art--there is one obsessed, cruel, megalomaniacal genius at the helm. Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole) is the most vivid depiction of a Hollywood director ever captured on film. He is a true patriarch, playing father/lover/drill sergeant to his cast and crew, and they all love/hate/fear him for it. Anyone who's ever been near an actual film set can tell you how accurate the character is.

But what makes this film just about the last word on the subject is Richard Rush's brilliant blurring of fantasy and reality. That, after all, is the main occupation of those who toil in the ""Dream Factory"" of show biz. Note the many references to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Steve Railsback (who is terrific) is Alice, and Eli and his mad crew are what he finds on the other side of the looking glass. He is running from bleak reality, straight into the arms of an instant family: father (O'Toole), uncle (the screenwriter played by Allen Goorwitz), brother (fellow stuntman Chuck Bail), and love interest (Hershey). And they all may be planning to kill him on camera, just to make their movie even better. Now, that's Wonderland--and that's Hollywood!

Few films before or since this 1980 gem have given us such a true, terrifying, hilarious view of the process of manufacturing dreams. Truffaut's DAY FOR NIGHT is the only one I can think of that comes close. How tall is King Kong? As tall as we want him to be.

442635,5,6302260973,"""The Stuntman"" is one of those films that having watched it once your not totally sure what you just experienced. Having watched ""The Stuntman"" several times there are at least three plotline levels to this movie.
First is a ""Rambo"" like Vietnam Viet on the run movie.
Second is a an World War 1 Antiwar Comedy.
Third is Movie about Stunt work and Stuntmen.
Forth I'm still not positive what happened to ""Burt"" was he murdered or killed or did he escape to LA.
Fifth is a guided tour of ""Alice in Wonderland"" film within a film with in a film.
What I mean by that is after multiple viewings you suddenly realize that the first three plotlines have blended into one plotline and your Point of View has becomes more distant. What the film ""is"" a unique look at filmaking magic that leaves you always questioning reality.

Director Richard Rush is making a film about making a BAD movie. So it is extremely differcult to differentiate between genius/chaos.
Chuck Bail is a God!
Steve Railsback begins the film looking like Charlie Manson.
He cleans up well. Still he is an interesting choice as our hero. One keeps on expecting ""Charlie"" to kill everyone any minute
Barbara Hershey is an actress we do not see enough in films.
She plays the neurotic actress rather well.
Peter O'Toole portrayal of Eli Cross is outstanding nears but never goes over the top.

442636,5,6302260973,"Interesting mix of reality vs. make believe (done up in a Hollywood blender, of course). A man (Steve Railsback), on the run from the police, wanders onto the set of a movie shoot and is witness to a stuntman's ""accidental"" death. Peter O'Toole, director of the movie, talks Railsback into performing the same stunt. Much of the film we're watching is a behind-the-scenes expose of what it's really like to do stunt work, as Railsback is prepared for the stunt.

As the time for the stunt nears (it involves driving a car off a bridge), Railsback begins to wonder if O'Toole really wants him killed in the stunt, thus getting rid of the only outside witness to the original ""accident."" We really can't tell, either, and it's only after the stunt is completed (successfully) do we know. O'Toole is excellent, almost bigger than the movie itself; everyone else is just okay. It's a tad too long and drags in the middle section, but it's an excellent idea well done - especially at the end where clout is needed.",1135209600,,1009,4.668539325842697
442637,4,6302260973,"Okay, yes -- Steve Railsback is not John Garfield, but he's strangely good. And Barbara Hershey has a little too much ambition in certain scenes, (keep in mind, however, that she's playing an actress who's playing at not seeming like an actress during emotionally charged interactions with Cameron -- therefore, the bouts of superficial drama might be appropriate for her character), however -- this is a fun, colorful film, and is very much unlike anything else that came out in the 1980s. It entertains, and it does so in a comic book sort of way. Not too serious, not too stylish, and certainly not at all derivitive. It took me two viewings before I realized that I really enjoyed larger chunks of this stew than I'd initially allowed myself. During and and following the first viewing, I was almost queasy. I bought it because the cover art was compelling, and not knowing anything else about the film, convinced my girlfriend to sit and watch it with me. It wasn't what I thought it would be...too splashy, too campy, exaggerated acting, cliched lines, and simplistic themes. It wasn't what I wanted it to be. BUT! But but but...it started that next week, throughout of which, I caught myself humming snippets of the score. I'd think to myself -- hey, man, stop that! That film was a turkey! Then I found myself craving to see certain sequences from the begining again. And then certain bits of the dialogue struck me in a way they'd failed to before. In other words, the second time out, for some reason, the shortcomings I'd percieved in the initial viewing were less prominent in the mix next to the brilliant moments. In my opinion, the first half is the most compelling part of the film. Suffice to say, three viewings later, and I can say, I wouldn't want this film to be out of my collection, and I try to keep my collection clean. Give this film a chance...It is original, unique, and in hindsight (for me, at least) a medley of delightfully colorful and comic scenes. The bad news: I've gone through two copies of this DVD and BOTH discs had sector errors on the same part of the disc...toward the ending. What gives? This needs to be reissued again. Very disappointing. Luckily, the best bits are in the first half anyway.",1132358400,2,2238,4.654040404040404
442638,4,6302260973,"The original King Kong was 3'6"" and the central gimmick of The Stunt Man is blurring the distinction between reality and the illusion created by film. Steve Railsback (the main character) is on the run for a silly crime and finds his way to a beach resort. As he enters the resort a song begins playing on the soundtrack: 'Out of nowhere, out of darkness into light...and you watch and wonder where you belong, and the crowd it moves and takes you along....you ask yourself what good are your dreams, in a world where nothing is as it seems'. The song sums up the title character's situation and its melody will replay several times later in the film.

He joins a crowd watching the film production of a WWI battle sequence. The crowd politely applauds at the end of each take. Then during a new scene there are huge explosions and smoke obscures much of where the action is being staged. The onlookers (and we viewers) look on with horror as the smoke clears and reveals a beach saturated with blood and dismembered bodies. The onlookers scream, the director yells cut, and the stunt men pull themselves out of the sand unhurt. The crowd goes wild with applause, far more appreciative about being fooled by the 'fabricated reality' than they were by their glimpse behind the scenes of the movie-making action. And this is the structure with The Stunt Man, viewers (like those in the crowd) are supposed to be kept off balance by this movie within a movie.

Yet this is merely a device to advance the storyline, which involves a complex theme about paranoia and trust. Railsback likens his relationship with the movie company's director-Peter O'Toole, and by analogy everyone's situation at some point of their life, to an incident he witnessed in Viet Nam. Someone stepped on a 'Bouncing Betty Mine', an anti-personnel device that while triggered by a person's weight, does not actually detonate until the person steps off the device. At this point there is no choice but to remain standing on the mine, trusting that something will happen to favorably change the situation. Just as in life there are times in the 'free will vs destiny' interplay when there is nothing you can do but place your trust a higher authority. Like 'The Ninth Configuration' (a film made about the same time and highly recommended for those interested in this theme); an authority figure works to redeem someone in his care by teaching them to trust someone or something, even when everything screams for them to step off the mine.

While The Stunt Man is an excellent movie, which tells a valuable story in an interesting multi-layered fashion; it is not really the masterpiece that Director Richard Rush and its biggest fans claim. A lot of effort was made to portray Eli Cross (the O'Toole character) as an omniscient 'Godlike' figure and a genius filmmaker; a necessary characterization if the film's theme is to be sold to the viewing audience. Unfortunately these efforts are largely undermined by the moronic nature of the film within the film. The artistic picture this eccentric genius is making is not even on the intellectual level of Laurel and Hardy's 'Flying Deuces', and it has about the same level of slapstick with none of the humor. So there is a major credibility disconnect. You have to sympathize with Wells as he had huge obstacles to overcome getting this film into production and he simply did not have the resources to stage a credible action-adventure tale. But a better approach would have been to stage small things well rather than grand things cheaply; so the painfully on-the-cheap production design is ultimately his fault.

A director bent on misdirection has a huge arsenal for manufacturing illusion; look at the widely different techniques successfully employed in 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Sixth Sense', and 'State & Main' for viewer misdirection. It is easy because the viewer only knows what the director chooses to reveal, yet the director must be careful that the viewer does not feel cheated. As Roger Ebbert said, some of the stunts are staged so that they're not only deceiving to Railsback (as intended), but plainly impossible. And the stunts are sneaky, at one point Railsback is on a tower that's blown up in flames. There is no plausible way he could have escaped alive-but the movie merely cuts to another shot of him, without explaining his escape. A film that depends on deceiving us has got to play by its own rules. Deceiving the audience is the magic of movies, but they can't be cheated on particulars.

Overall the degree of misdirection was rather spartan and not particularly clever (that darn low budget) , meaning that they did not begin to create the degree of suspense that was necessary.

That said there were some interesting little details to look for when watching this film: A tight two-shot of Railsback and O'Toole on the beach, they step onto a platform which turns out to be attached to an unseen crane and are lifted into the air, the actors do not betray that this is happening-their conversation continues as the background changes. O'Toole compares Railsback to Alice about to enter Wonderland, he asks him to close his eyes and then the scene cuts to a hairdresser telling Railsback to open his eyes and see his physical transformation. Watch for the many deep focal transitions (particularly at the dinner scene) and the literal framing (like a painting with a frame)of many shots-which is used to promote the everything is a fabricated illusion message. Watch for the piglets spilling out of the baby carriage during one of the battle scenes-another Alice element. Watch for the very inventive shot of Railsback looking into the rolled down car window, shot through the rolled up window on the other side, with Barbara Hershey's face reflected in the frame.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1123027200,8,5856,4.8441558441558445
442639,2,6302260973,"A cheesy movie.  Characters are shallow and underdeveloped.  Stunts and editing both were amateurish.  The only redeeming quality was that Peter O'Toole was as crazy as ever.  It may be a cult classic, but is a poorly made film.",1122422400,3,228,4.769230769230769
442640,2,6302260973,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons, the first being Peter O'Toole (god of acting), and the second being that other reviewers claimed it was a mind trip. On the first point my money was well spent. O'Toole gives a virtuoso performance, with all of his characteristic dry wit and style. His performance was in fact very nearly the only reason I gave the film 2 stars instead of zero. The stunts were also remarkable. In nearly all other aspects however, this film fails miserably. The female lead is alluring, but Railsback is truly a pathetic excuse for an actor. His Veitnam vet was emotionally dead and a ridiculous stereotype. The film's script is sloppy and overlong, and I'd like to point out the wisdom of an earlier reviewer who commented ot the hypocrisy of the story and its characters. As for this being a mind trip which changes the way we look at cinema, the film was behind its mask of intellectualism without any interesting comments to be made. Not even the most neanderthal-like of film-goers doesn't know that hollywood is full of cutthroat executives and that cinema plays with our sense of reality. I was extremely dissapointed in this film, its excellent premise and the presence of O'Toole getting my hopes up. Anyone who worships this film, as I'm aware many do, than I pity their ignorance of the far better films out their.

I would reccomend to anyone who likes this film John Fowles novel ""The Magus"", to which it owes much, as well as Terry Gilliam's film Brazil, another cult favorite mind trp, but a far better one",1120003200,4,1541,4.665441176470588
442641,3,6302260973,"The Stunt Man is a delight for the senses.  From the police chase at the beginning of the film, to the freak-out by Steve Ralisback about his past crimes, this movie will put your emotions on a whimsical wirlt-o-tilt.  Richard Rush directs a flawless first half-hour; filled with seamless movement from Ralisback's flight from the police into the movie set.  Rush makes sure to film some parts of his own film as if he was shooting for the movie within.  It makes for some great tension and humor in the beginning.  Then we come to find out it is the incredibly handsome O'Toole that is the conductor of the film that our hero has stumbled upon.  The first exchange between the two is wonderful; O'Toole does all the talking, the only intellegent and sensible talking he does all movie.  He immediately sets the tone by manipulating the young man into covering for the last stunt man who has died.  The two never develop a trusting relationship, with O'Toole using the stunt man as a body double, and Ralisback using O'Toole as an alibi.  If you haven't guessed already, the stunt man falls for the leading lady, and of course vice versa, which allows for a subplot about a love that never was between o'Toole and the movie's leading lady (Barbara Hershey) that just complicates things without improving the depth of the characters.  O'Toole's character is ridiculous, and downright annoying at times.  When we finally find out about the stunt man's past crimes, its through a tantrum that brought me to my knees in tears, laughing.  The best scene in the movie is near the end, when the Stunt man looks back through his car's rear window during his final stunt.  This movie at times is a very good satire on over-dramatic, poorly-written, action movies.  At other times it is a poorly-written and over-dramatic action movie.  Its schizo nature both intrigued me, and made me angry. The movie was so stereotypical in its depiction of not only hollywood personalities, but also the characters that are supposedly from the 'real world', that its tough to distinguish caricatures from characters.  At one point in the film, a member of O'Toole's film crew complains studios cut out too many scenes.  It would have been a good idea in this one.",1107216000,2,2240,4.761658031088083

Peter O' Toole is a fascinatingly sadistic and yet intellectual director in the movie known as Eli Cross. Steve Railsback plays Cameron, a Vietnam veteran who is running away from the cops when he runs right onto a movie set and ends up avoiding a near-roadkill from one of the stuntmen. The stunt man ends up dying and Eli wants Steve to be his replacement, that way, it's also a solution for Eli to disguise himself from the cops. From there on, you see Cameron involved in a lot of stunts and movie shoots and the combination of action and comedy picks up. It gets quite interesting but the real power of the movie comes from Peter O' Toole's great performance, without him, I really don't know how good the movie would be regardless of how good the screenplay is. This movie was released the same year as Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and I'm not even sure if they can make another movie like it today. You should watch this movie at least once because it shows the complication of whether or not we're in reality or fantasy, whether or not things are real or fake and whether or not you're running away from the cops or being filmed.

Peter O'Toole was the only bright spot in this film and I felt embarrassed for him - a Shakespearian heavyweight surrounded by a cast fit for nothing better than daytime soap operas.  (Although I have enjoyed Alex Rocco as 'Roger Myers Jr.' in the Simpsons.)
And there's no defending Steve Railsback's performance; while many saw his Cameron struggling with the director's mania, all I could see was a hack struggling to convey a range of emotions far beyond him.  (Were he truly worth his salt, would his post-Stunt Man filmography include such classics as 'Armed and Dangerous', 'Alligator II: The Mutation', 'Nukie' and 'Barb Wire'?)

Fortunately this overlooked gem manages to mix stops-out stunt sequences with a borderline-pretentious paranoia plot to cover all bases with ease. Jobbing greenhorn Steve Railsback gets a job in the stunt team of Peter O'Toole's director's World War One action romance, falls for the leading lady, has his every waking moment interrupted by O'Toole on an ace crane-mounted director's chair, and finally takes on the escape from a sinking car stunt that killed his predecessor. There's plenty of elementary-grade symbolism thrown at it (O'Toole's messianic character is called Eli Cross, in true ramming-the-point-home style), and the whole ""What is reality after all? Eh?

On one level, it's a fascinating look at the making of a movie --the often volatile relationships, power struggles and behind the scenes manipulations. It's really, however, about something much more fundamental. Steve Railsback plays a fugitive who hides out on a movie set and becomes a stunt man. Peter O'Toole is a meglomaniacal director who is either helping or exploiting --and possibly even planning to murder-- Railsback. To further complicate matters, Railsback falls in love with the leading lady of the film, played by Barbara Hershey. Who can trust whom? What is real? The movie set becomes a metaphor for the uncertainties of life itself, a theme that was later explored in The Truman Show, a film that was good but not as profound as The Stunt Man. This is one of those films that, if it grabs you as it did me, you can literally watch over and over again and pick up new insights.",1025308800,5,959,4.647058823529412
442682,5,6302260973,"This is mostly for ENZAM, and those who may also be confused.
The Stunt Man is one of my favorite films of all time.  I've seen it many times and perhaps I can explain the scene he presented as an example of a 'silly contivance'.  In the scene with the original stunt man on the bridge, he stops NOT to give Cameron a ride, but to get ready for a stunt.  He then kicks him out when he realizes that Cameron has gotten into the car.  He guns the car and turns around NOT to run over Cameron, but to do the stunt.
This scene is a perfect example of why the film works so well.  Everything that happens in this scene is seen from Cameron's point of view.  Cameron's somewhat paranoid view.  Only after this scene plays out are we, along with Cameron, shown the rest of the crew making the movie.  And as the film goes on we learn more insight about this scene.  The original stunt man, Burt, was so hopped up, to do this dangerous stunt, we understand why he acted the way he did.
The Stunt Man is one of those films that you will have the best experience with on your first viewing.  As the audience, you take this ride along with Cameron, finding out what's going on as he does.  And the twists and turns are wonderful.  This is a GREAT script.  It reveals its secrets little by little until, by the end of the film, we understand what's going on, why people have done what they've done, and it's a wonderful payoff.
As for the acting, EVERYONE does a GREAT job in their rolls.  Steve Railsback is not 'sleepwalking through the movie'.  He's playing a haunted character who doesn't see a place for himself in this world, and he plays it great with all of the cynicism, anger, and frustration of a defeated man.

Its about a convict, named Cameron, who hides out in a movie production. The director, played by O'Toole, makes him a deal that will could Cameron a free man or a dead man.

This is a film that if anything test our limits of perception. Any picture that has a dog licking its testicles in the first minute has got to be something of a different breed. Its different, and that's good. Believe me, we need fresh films like this now.",1020643200,6,941,4.408045977011494
442744,2,6302260973,"Don't be misled by the hype surrounding this movie... it may have become a cult film, but contrary to all the glowing reviews, I found it barely watchable!
Steve Railsback seems to be sleepwalking through the movie, he can barely act, and slurrs his lines routinely... the excellent Barbara Herschey is hopelessly miscast as a flighty star, and only the superb Peter O'Toole saves this movie from being a total waste of time (and even so, he hams it up a bit too much.)
The script, though imaginative, is filled with ridiculous turns and silly contrivances (example: in a crucial beginning turn, the original stunt man first stops to give Cameron a ride, then he kicks him out of the car, and turns around to roll over him. Why? What? How? This crucial turn is never explained further.)
Get this DVD if you are a super fan of Peter O'Toole, otherwise don't waste your time!",1019520000,5,873,4.638709677419355
442745,5,6302260973,"1980's ""The Stunt Man"" sat on my shelf for a very long time before I finally got around to watching it.  Boy, was I stupid for not viewing it earlier!  It's a highly-engrossing, mesmerizing experience! One of those ""can't-take-your-eyes-off-it-for-a-second"" type of motion pictures.
Peter O'Toole, Steve Railsback, and Barbara Hershey star in this movie-within-a-movie.  Everyone here is great, but Mr. O'Toole is, in my opinion, Oscar-caliber as the hard-as-nails director attempting desperately to make the perfect anti-war film.
The quirky music score adds amusement to the stunt scenes performed by Railsback.
High praise is deserved all around for this one .... a film that will transfix you to your screen.  You WILL want to see it again.",1017446400,3,744,5.333333333333333
442746,5,6302260973,"The Stunt Man has always been one of my favorite movies. It contains some of the best work of Peter O'Toole's, one of England's great actors. A young Barbara Hershey is, like the candy bar, good enough to eat and Steve Railsback delivers a great performance as the paranoid fugitive/stunt man. When this movie first was released, it was one of the most unique films I had ever seen. A rare blend of action/adventure, comedy, satire, and love story, it defied simple categorization. Although today we are much more knowledgeable about movie making techniques and thus can shoot a few more holes in the story, ""The Stunt Man"" holds up pretty well to the test of time. After watching it countless times, I still marvel at the witty dialogue and clever plot twists. It is not your typical Hollywood formula movie.
Perhaps the most enjoyable parts of this new DVD are the special features. The director's audio track and the companion disk ""The Sinister Saga of the Making of the Stunt Man"" finally shed some light on the trials and tribulations that Richard Rush encountered while making and releasing this film. If you loved the movie like I did, you must see this recent (2000) look back by the director on his greatest movie accomplishment. It includes recent interviews with many of the stars. It is interesting to hear how this project affected them and their careers. If you have never seen ""The Stunt Man"", you owe it to yourself to do so. You won't be disappointed.",1008115200,24,1469,4.719844357976654
442747,4,6302260973,"""THE STUNT MAN"" a bona fide cult-fave starring Peter O'Toole finally makes it's digital appearance in a sharp looking transfer.  Steve Railsback is a Vietnam vet on the lam who literally falls into, and becomes a stunt man, in the make-believe world of a war film directed by the diabolically manipulative O'toole.  Barbara Hershey is the ""actress"" he falls in love with on screen and off.  But what's real and what's not becomes a twisting labyrinth of perception and deception in this surprising roller-coaster  comedic action thriller.  There's enthusiastic commentary from co-writer director Richard Rush, O'Toole, Railsback and Hershey, deleted scenes and in DVD-ROM there's a complete screenplay with director's notes.  A cool movie that taps into the ""Matrix"" mind set of multilayered realities and the problems of being a hero in real life, whatever that is.",1007856000,3,866,5.2846715328467155
442748,4,6302260973,"The Stunt Man is, viewing after viewing, my favorite movie. Not only are Peter O'Toole and Steve Railsback Oscar-worthy in tailor-made roles, Barbara Hershey probably was better only in Woody Allen's ""Hannah."" Above all, the screenplay crackles. And on DVD, it looks better than I've ever seen it. Images are sharper, more vivid and widescreen.
 The disc is a must-see.",1005782400,,369,5.15
442749,5,6302260973,"This is a great movie. One of Steve Railsback's earlier films, it showed the great promise which has been realized over the course of his movie career. His portrayal of Cameron, the Viet Nam vet on the run, is heart stopping, poignant and totally believable. Why wasn't this actor given a better chance at the big time? Peter O'Toole is terrific in this movie as the tyrant director and the stunts are really great and fun. Watch this again and again and feel good.",1003881600,2,465,4.5476190476190474

And now, FINALLY, my favorite movie OF ALL TIME is getting the DVD special edition treatment that it deserves.
F A N T A S T I C ! ! !
I first saw this film at the age of 15 on the pay service ON-TV, (everyone who remembers that, raise your hand).  And instantly fell in love with its characters and story.
This film has it all...  Drama, comedy, action, romance, mystery....  Every performance is right on - Everyone involved is at the top of their game.  A great soundtrack.  And more great lines than you usually find in a dozen films...
I'm especially stoked, because although this is my favorite film of all time and I've seen it MANY times, I never got to see it in a theater...

Peter O'Toole flying around in his helicopter added a touch of extra action and director's importance to this strange movie.

442793,4,6302260973,"When this movie first came out 20+ years ago, I was mesmerized - couldn't see it too many times!  I remember catching it on probably HBO (what else was there then?) and just watching over and over.  This is probably where my Peter O'Toole fascination began.  Wasn't my usual kind of movie, but for some reason it really hooked me.  When I was in San Diego 3 years ago, it was one of the reasons I went to the Hotel Coronado and studied the roof lines!  Although I haven't seen the movie in years, and have only thought of it sporadically, it is definitely one of my all-time favorites.

442796,5,6302260973,This is without a doubt one of the most inventive films to deal with the fine line between reality and illusionism. Storyline is filled with unexpected twists and turns.

442797,5,6302260973,"If there ever was a film that deserved to be called 'one of a kind', this is one of them. It is so good it deserves multiple viewings.  I have always thought of it as a black comedy, but it's also exciting and suspeseful. The screenplay and plot may not seem so tightly-wound on your first viewing but they are, the screenplay is amazing giving O'Toole lots of juicy dialogue. I believe that a film must make you feel lots of things, that is what 'The Stunt Man' does it plays around with you just as O'Toole is playing around with Railsback's character, most people don't like this, but viewers who actually know a little something about movies and are open minded will love it. Railsback is OK as a vietnam-vet-turned-stunt-man who is already having reality/fantasy problems which escalate through the roof when he meets O'Toole's character. O'Toole clearly steals the film as God-like Eli Cross, his performance is amazing and his dialogue is so juicy you find youself playing his scenes over and over. Barbara Hershey is also great in a supporting role as the woman between O'Toole and Railsback.  Richard Rush directed the film with an eccentrci mood and beautiful pace, I wonder why he never made any more films. This film comes highly recommended, the problem is that not everyone is ready for this kind of films so I recommend filling in on filmdom's most accesible classics so you can adquire judgement and enjoy these little treasures. Great film, great entertainment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",970876800,2,1522,4.739622641509434
442798,3,6302260973,"This is a clever movie with a lot of potential, but it doesn't seem to use  this potential to the fullest. The only attraction here is the magnetic  peformance of Peter O'Toole, who is in one of his best roles.",968803200,2,210,4.225
442799,5,6302260973,"This film is a series of reality inversions.  As fugitive on the run Steve Railsback blunders into a movie set, he sets off a chain of events that leads...well, no one seems to know where.  Director Eli Cross takes him  under his wing, or seems to.  The Barbara Hershey character falls in love  with him, or seems to.  And someone wants him dead, or seems to, or maybe  doesn't.  It all comes to light in the final Duesenberg plunge off the  bridge.  Scattered throughout are many acidic comments on the movie  business--one scene has O'Toole wishing that the script writer could see  the daily rushes, as the director had kept a line or two of his dialog  intact.  Peter O'Toole's performance is a gem, worthy to be set at the  other end of the stylistic spectrum of _Lawrence of Arabia_.  His cynical  grimace could curdle milk at fifty paces.

O' Tooles best work (along with Creator) this movie should have  taken the Oscars but didn't have the names of Raging Bull.
