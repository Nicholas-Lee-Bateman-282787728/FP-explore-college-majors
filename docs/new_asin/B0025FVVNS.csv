This is also not a warning that it will not play in a DVD player unless you have a region free DVD.  That is a true statement.  This is a warning that if you order this and receive it, shake it to make sure the DVD's are not loose.  I ordered it and they were.  The inside of the DVD case was broken.  One of the disks was dislodged and scratched.  I have returned it for a refund.  It costs to much not to have received it in perfect condition. And besides what good is a broken case?  I hope to re-order this some time in the future, but wanted to warn everyone.  Amazon will not replace the order, so I guess if I really want it, I have to re-order it several months from now and hope they can send me one that is not damaged.",1345766400,,813,3.8373493975903616
