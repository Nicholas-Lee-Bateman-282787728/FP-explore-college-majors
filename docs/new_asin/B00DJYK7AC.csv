8593908,5,B00DJYK7AC,"I've been dimly aware of Wolfgang Rihm for many years because his shorter works have often been fillers on recordings. But it was only in December of 2011 that I seriously began to listen to his music, and I have become a true devotee. To date I have purchased (through Amazon's wonderful service!) 30 cds and 2 dvds. I mention these numbers for impact: they represent less than 10% of this prolific composer's published works! I am amazed at the high standards in work after work, and the clear individual voice that sounds in every piece. Rihm admits that he has a special rapport with Nietzsche and this opera certainly represents a culminating event of that rapport. This is most definitely not a biographical work, nor is it an explication of Nietzsche's philosophy. It is rather an excursion within the mind of Nietzsche at a time when he was perilously close to mental collapse. The Turin Horse is nearby so to speak. Rihm drew his libretto entirely from lines of poems in ""Dithyrambs of Dionysus"" - in other words, there is no dialogue as such. Pierre Audi's brilliant (as usual) staging further emphasizes the visionary quality as do Jonathan Meese's stunning set designs and art work. I have played this dvd six times and I am still assessing it, but it is most definitely one of my favorite Rihm works. The orchestral score and vocal lines remind me of his earlier opera, ""Oedipus"", and the operas  share a primal tragic essence. They are dramas of suffering, unrelieved by any ""deus ex machine"", or plot twists that allow amelioration of tragic destiny. At present, in my listening, I do not find catharsis in ""Dionysus"". The ending seems to be one of moral exhaustion; the character called N can simply endure no more, he is spent, humanity at its absolute limit. Perhaps further encounters will alter my view - or not. In any case, I look forward to many more performances. How is it that viewing tragedy can  be so rewarding? But it is, and here is another Rihm masterpiece to prove that point. (For a recent non-tragic work by Rihm, listen to ""Nahe Fern"" his Brahms-inflected symphony - WOW!)",1384041600,8,2108,4.725543478260869
8593909,3,B00DJYK7AC,"So I just finished watching the performance and quite frankly, I'm not sure what I saw.  The singing was excellent and the sets were odd but probably appropriate if I had known what it was all about.  I watched the lengthy documentary first hoping that it would help - it didn't.  I need to watch all of this again.  My only complaint was the video direction.  Once again, the director can't resist showing the orchestra, individual players and the conductor.  It happened primarily early on and in the last 10 minutes.  I just find this incredibly irritating and breaks my concentration.  Also there was an occasional out-of-focus shot.",1381708800,7,637,4.833333333333333
