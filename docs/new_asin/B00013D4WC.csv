8005962,1,B00013D4WC,"Truly a case of buyers remorse. This was for my grandson a few months ago. The animation is poor, so is the voice acting. Disk stopped working after a few plays.",1383955200,,161,4.225806451612903
8005963,1,B00013D4WC,"Unfortunately, this is not the version of Jack and the Beanstalk that I remember as a child nor is it appropriate for small children or any children.  It is sinister, dark, with demonic-like characters.  I along with my colleagues (educators) were very disappointed.  I think it actually scared the children.  I wish I could return it.  The quality of the DVD is good, good color, etc.  Arrived promptly and was securely packaged.  But the version of the story is TERRIBLE.  I will continue searching for a more child-friendly version.",1382227200,,535,4.932584269662922
