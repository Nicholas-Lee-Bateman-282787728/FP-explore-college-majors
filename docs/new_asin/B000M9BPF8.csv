2727563,3,B000M9BPF8,"Being a transplant to Kansas, I had heard some talk of the Wichita serial killer. Wichita is over 100 miles from the little Kansas town that I have lived in since 1970 so it was far removed enough from me that I paid little attention to it.  However, the day Dennis Rader was apprehended I was a patient in a Wichita hospital and coverage of him and his arrest was all over the TV. I became pretty interested in the case and began to look into it.  This movie follows the actual story reasonably well.  I was unimpressed with the acting but if you're just wanting to see a story about what really happened, this is the closest-to-the-facts version I have seen.  There are two other BTK DVDS available on Amazon, but they are unwatchable.  This one isn't all that great, but it does give you an overall idea of what happened.",1264982400,8,824,4.394736842105263
2727564,4,B000M9BPF8,"Assuming you have followed the BTK case, you will want to rent this.  Buy it? Guess that depends upon your level of obsession. If you know enough about Rader then you will find Gregg Henry's performance at least somewhat inspired if not borderline spooky. His mannerisms are spot on, and he does at least resemble the man. Although Rader is far from human in my eyes, Henry succeeds in bringing out his level of depravity.  This work is something made-for-TV, sanctioned by local Wichita Author Beattie (multiple cameos), that was maybe on CourtTV (?) At any rate, it is insightful, yet never really makes you feel immersed or entirely sympathetic towards any of the protagonists.  At a skim 88 minutes, it is simply an ""addendum"" to Beattie's excellent book.  Read that, then see this.  It is at least somewhat budgeted.  Not every detail is accurate (miniscule stuff that only would bother the locals).  3 and 1/2 stars.",1174521600,26,922,4.834394904458598

2727587,4,B000M9BPF8,"I've seen two other movies about BTK. One was grossly inaccurate; the other was just gross! This one was pretty good.
I would have liked to see more about what drove him to commit the murders, there's enough written about it. Hopefully, after the book, which he co-wrote comes out, later this year; we'll see the whole picture!",1455148800,,327,4.655172413793103
2727588,5,B000M9BPF8,"I am an unabashed true crime buff, but I tend to steer away from dramatizations of cases that I'm interested in, preferring documentary style as it usually lends more credence and accuracy to the production. I came to this movie with a fairly detailed knowledge of this case, having just finished listening to the unabridged audiobook of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unholy-Messenger-The-Life-and-Crimes-of-the-BTK-Serial-Killer/dp/B000GCFY0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer</a>, in addition to my previous working knowledge gleaned from news articles, broadcast specials, etc.

That being said, I thought this movie did an excellent job of portraying the case as a narrative drama while holding true to the facts of the case. I noted only minor deviations from fact for dramatic impact, and none of these drew attention away from the central accounting of the events. Casting Gregg Henry as Rader/BTK was a great choice; he is a versatile actor who brought great verisimilitude to the portrayal of Rader. In short, he shines here. Robert Forster plays nicely as the ""cop foil,"" and again the narration and dialogue reflects fairly accurately with what I know of the case. I would feel comfortable recommending this movie as an introduction to the case to someone who had no prior knowledge. And that's saying quite a lot, given what TV movies of true crime cases usually end up being.",1455062400,,1489,5.588495575221239

2727605,5,B000M9BPF8,"I'm a huge watcher of safe-danger, true life films, and serial killer pieces are of particular importance to me. This film was very well done.

2727608,4,B000M9BPF8,"Very slow going pace but the lead actor did a great job as BTK and the detective scenes gave the story needed momentum. I wish the script would've went in order instead of flashback scenes. They move from the court room, to present time, then to the murders. Easy to follow though. I have to note, the music was atrocious and sounded like something out of a funhouse carnival, it kept going and going...we were laughing at one point.",1392768000,,433,4.493670886075949
2727609,4,B000M9BPF8,A seemingly acurate portrayal of the BTK killer in both performance and story. Not exceptional enough to give it 5 stars.,1390780800,,121,4.809523809523809
2727610,2,B000M9BPF8,"I like original movies, and this was a remake to the one I saw on TV. I would not recommend unless you like remakes.",1384646400,,116,3.875
2727611,4,B000M9BPF8,"I think that the average American -- perhaps even most profilers in the FBI -- thinks that serial killers meet the following criteria:  white male, 30 to 40 years old, balding, never-been-married-and-no-girlfriend-dude-who-lives-with-mommy misogynist, and perhaps average-to-slightly-higher-than-average intelligence.  Lo and behold, you have to admit, Dennis Rader met at least half of these criteria, so you'd perhaps think that the police would have caught him earlier.  But I guess that a lot of local police officers don't give much credence to FBI profilers.  But maybe those police officers have a point.

I read an excellent book about Ted Bundy written by Robert Keppel quite a while ago, and from what I remember, Mr. Bundy told Dr. Keppel that, while it's OK to build a basic profile of The Green River Killer, that it wasn't wise to get too attached to that profile.  Mr. Bundy went on to say something like, ""Well, this Riverman of yours,"" as Mr. Bundy called Gary Ridgeway long before anyone knew who Mr. Ridgeway much was, ""I mean, he's the type that fits into his environment.  He's the type that people feel comfortable with.  So don't think that the guy will just look like a monster.""  I'm paraphrasing quite a bit, but that was the gist of it.  And Mr. Bundy was totally right about the killer that Mr. Keppel was searching for:  Mr. Ridgeway was married, he had a job, he probably wasn't ugly but he wasn't a pretty boy either.  And he fit right in as he was a customer of the prostitutes that he killed.  They knew him and mostly trusted him.

It's amazing to me how much the BTK murders in Kansas mirrored the Green River Killer murders in Seattle.  Murders started in the 70s (perhaps early 80s, at the latest); it seemed that the killer would never be caught; the advent of DNA testing gave the police a strong suspect 20 to 30 years after the killing began; one cop in particular kept at the case for all the years which caused him professional and personal pain; and some strange twist of fate allowed the police to finally catch the killer in the early-to-mid 2000s.  Sure, Mr. Ridgeway killed prostitutes while Mr. Rader did not.  And Mr. Ridgeway was on the police radar for a very long time while Mr. Rader seemed to appear out of the blue, ""like a ghost,"" as ""his"" detective said during this movie.  But each case had one killer and one cop, over almost the exact same time frame, where each cop-killer pair seemed to be bonded forever.

I watched ""The Capture of the Green River Killer"" awhile back, and I just watched ""The BTK Killer"" today.  I'd have to say that the films are quite different.  The former tried to be artistic by using one of the victims from that case, who appears as a kind of a ghost, from a first-person perspective.  (I believe that that victim was actually fictitious for legal reasons.)  Some things worked, some things didn't, but that film had it's moments, although I found it slightly manipulative.  This film is more of a standard police procedural, which I think in some ways is a better and surely safer approach.  I believe that ""Green River"" came more from the victims' perspectives, while BTK came more from the killer's perspective.  Perhaps I liked this film just a little bit more, but it was close.

But returning to the subject of profiling, after watching this film, there is one trait that I'm not convinced that Mr. Rader had:  above average intelligence.  After all, what serial killer would be stupid enough to send digital media to the police that would directly indict him?  Well, I know of one.",1370822400,,3576,4.693418940609952
2727612,4,B000M9BPF8,"The Hunt For the BTK Killer is based on the book Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler, which is also based on the real serial killer. The movie first aired in 2005 on CBS, but it later made its way to DVD. Between the years 1974 and 1991, Dennis Rader murdered ten people in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Gregg Henry plays the serial killer and he does a great job playing the psychopath.

I'm aware of the case as I live in Missouri and Rader's capture in 2005 was all over the news. Despite being made-for-television, The Hunt for the BTK Killer is a well made film with decent acting.",1350691200,4,598,4.339285714285714
2727613,5,B000M9BPF8,"After watching last week's BIO CHANNEL Episode ""Notorious"" (The BTK Killer Speaks, 2005) it shocked me to find out Dennis Rader's biography was similar to mine as far as job professions, birthdays, and more without mention (other than the murders, of course). I never really gave it a thought to see his whole biography until now (7 years later). It gave me a chill watching it, almost like watching my own biography (I know it's all just coincidental, but still), and my own biography is odd enough as it is. The only thing I remember is reading about it in the paper back in 2005, just bits and pieces of it. Never was much for the news back then.

Out of curiosity I had to buy this DVD after watching Notorious. Great movie but not praising murderers either. The interrogation near the end is what shocked me the most [""Am I getting a special section of the jail or am I gonna be thrown in with a bunch of loonies????!!!!!""] Gregg Henry played a convincing role, looks almost identical to Dennis Rader.

2727614,5,B000M9BPF8,"WOW! What a preformance from Gregg Henry who played BTK, i mean this guy REALLY got into his role, i mean have you ever seen this BTK's true confessions?

The other actors pull their load as well, Robert Foster is good as always. not to gory, but does show some disturbing BTK home invasion scenes, well worth the buy!",1322438400,3,435,4.589743589743589

8167303,4,B000M9BPF8,"This movie has some boring parts (backstory, the detective's homelife, etc), but the real reason to watch this is the brilliant actor who plays Rader, Gregg Henry. He is creepy and scary and seems almost indistinguishable from the real horrid excrement of a human being that is Rader. Thus, a 3 star ""nice"" little movie gets 4 from me, for that performance alone. The dialogue between the detectives is often over-explanatory and does not seem how real gummybearshoes would talk, in my omniscient opinion.",1507075200,,505,5.023809523809524
