1655179,5,B00005R248,"In this film, Werner Herzog uses the real life enigmatic character of Kasper Hauser to ask such questions as, ""Who are we?"", ""How do we learn?"" and ""What is it to be human?"" Questions of such singular importance that neither science, logic or religious dogma can offer adequate answers. Great truths are felt rather than analyzed and by fleshing out the very humanness of Kasper through the incredible performance of Bruno S., we gain such a sense of right and wrong that  societal convention seems out of balance and perverse. In the end we get the feeling that we can only learn anything from Kasper because he looks at the world without prejudice or preconceived notions of right and wrong. The film begins with the following written introduction: ""One Sunday in 1828 a ragged boy was found in the town of N. He could hardly walk and spoke but one sentence. Later he told of being locked in a dark cellar from birth. He had never seen a human being, a tree, a house before. To this day on one knows where he came from - or who set him free."" Kasper becomes for ""civilized"" society an experiment in humanity. The only problem is that he does not respond in expected ways, therefore, there must be something wrong with him - some scientifically explainable flaw! But through beautiful effective images we experience Kaspers humanity; the childlike joy he experiences while feeding a baby bird; tears of confusion pouring down his face after getting stung by a candle flame at the hands of those who know better; the tenderness he exhibits with an infant child. As Kasper is introduced to ""high"" society, essentially as a freakish novelty that can be molded into  conformity through ""education"", it is not he who is the real freak show, but those who  seem to be ashamed of their own attachment to nature. Suddenly Kasper is the only non-freak in the film! Herzog seems to have learned much from the story of Kasper Hauser and has created a beautiful testament to that spirit with this film.",1106784000,44,1991,4.682857142857143
1655180,5,B00005R248,"This winner of the 1975 Grand Jury Prize Cannes tells the story of an mysterious man isolated and found in very poor and miserable conditions . He can not articulate any word , since he has grown as almost a wild beast .

Nevertheless , he shows surprising advances and an overwhelming intelligence during his adapatation process to the society and shows a weird sense of prophecy . His death still remains far from resolving .

This bizarre and compelling film is very close to previous films such as The miracle worker (Artur Pen  1962) and The wild Child Francois Truffaut 1969). You can notice the echoes of this plot in other minor films such as K Pax , Nell and the unforgettable Nicholas Roeg work of 1976 The man who fell to earth .

This artistic work is illuminated with dark poetry and atmospheric charm .

Bruno Ganz is perfect in this complex role . And since Klaus Kinki was always the protegee of Herzog , his hard features could mean a serious obstacle to the character , where the naifness and the sense of loneliness should be reflected in every movement .

The direction was extraordinary . The influence of the german expresionism is undeniable in this sense . The movie is a gothic nightmare which involves this misterious human being .

This picture seems to improve with the age .

Watch one the major achievements of this superb creator of atmospheres and edge of the knife situations ; Werner Herzog.",1093910400,8,1425,4.604743083003952
1655181,5,B00005R248,"Werner Herzog makes great and fascinating movies - there's no doubt about it. His films are just ""neat"" (for lack of a better word). I love Herzong's films, and the ""Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" is one of his best. This movie represents well, the Romantic era in general. It's very well done, historically.
I don't know much about the true story behind Kaspar Hauser's life: who he was, where he came from, etc., but this movie held my interest deeply. It was a perplexing and stimulating story that truly made me think about a lot of things.
Bruno S. always wanted his identity to be kept somewhat secret, so that is why we call him ""Bruno S."". You gotta' respect that kind of ""anti-Hollywood"" mentality - that's so antifamous and noble. The lead character is brilliant in this film and Bruno S. should have received an Oscar. This is a true and genuine performance; so real. This is one of those roles that no one else could have ever played. It was made for Bruno and he for it. Bruno S. is Kaspar Hauser and Kaspar Hauser is Bruno S.!
This movie is wonderful - I loved every minute of it. Werner Herzong is a genius and Bruno S. is a natural!

One of the opening shot's is that of a wheat field blowing in the wind while Pachelbel's Cannon plays and the following words appear on the screen; ""Don't you hear that horrible screaming all around you? That screaming men call silence."" This sequence perfectly captures the essence of this film. The beauty of suffering seen through the eyes of a man that is completing untainted and untouched by society. This movie will change your life.

1655184,5,B00005R248,"First, the original title of this film is *not* The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. It's Every Man For Himself And God Against All.  The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser - also The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser - are America-only titles. That really doesn't detract from anything, but if you're ever looking for information on the film, you might want to know.
This is a great dvd, with a mildly informative biography of Herzog and (yay!) commentary from him.
The commentary is very worth listening to - more informative, I think, than the Criterion version's film essay would have been in this case.  Herzog is a very interesting man with a very storied past, and this commentary explores that.  Norman Hill - who shares the English track - seems to have been put there for the sole purpose of prompting Herzog into speech and gets grating after a while.
The movie itself is also wonderful - even if it feels at times to be missing Klaus Kinski, Herzog's lifelong friend and actor.  This is due mainly to the way that Kaspar Hauser shares the feel of Herzog's more famous work, Aguirre - The Wrath of God.  Many of the shots are the same:  foggy landscapes shot through multiple lenses to disassociate the viewer from them, images of isolation on the water, and, of course, the controlled manner of speech which Bruno S. adopts for the film.  There's even a moment where Bruno steps out in front of the camera in the very same fashion that Kinski invented for Aguirre.
A very worthwhile DVD, my only problem comes with the subtitles.  While they seem (mostly - Herzog comments on one or two moments) to be adequate translations, they are at times unreadable. I'm not sure how escapable that is given that this is a colour film, but it seems Criterion have done an ample job on similar works. Cries and Whispers comes to mind.  That one flaw, however, is minor and should in no way detract you from purchasing.",1019001600,20,1889,4.598214285714286

I hope the DVD version brings this treasure to a whole new audience.

1655186,5,B00005R248,"This film is a transcendent work of art: a perfect synthesis of content -- the critique of classical bourgeois European civilization through the eyes of one being socialized into it as a young adult, who is also in touch with the world of dreams, imagination, and otherness -- and form -- the sensitive filmic rendition of the tension between these two dimensions, done almost as though it had been filmed in the early 19th century, in which nature and otherness had not yet been totally overwhelmed by modernization. This is one of those rare films where the film is not only great as a whole, but each scene and each shot seems perfect, from the boat on the lake accompanied by music from Mozart's Magic Flute to Kaspar's dream of the Caucausus to his wild, disorganized effort to play the piano to his interrogation by two clerics to his social display by Lord Stanhope. If Theodor Adorno had been a filmmaker, this is one of the films he would have made.",1007424000,6,958,4.608187134502924

1655189,3,B00005R248,"Among all of Werner Herzog's films, I think ""Kaspar Hauser"" is the closest to a failure. There are other films by Herzog which I think are non-essential or unsuccessful, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heart-Of-Glass/dp/B00005R247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heart Of Glass</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Son-My-Son-What-Have-Ye-Done/dp/B003XJ9N6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done</a>."" But ""Kaspar Hauser"" reached for the mainstream, and so it has the largest gap between the immense aspirations of the film-maker and the final product. It has moments where it shines; it has all the confidence of Herzog in his prime. But there is also an unpleasant streak running through it.

The main problem with it is that it often feels like a grating harangue. Herzog's feral child is meant to be innocent and pure-hearted, while every facet of society is scheming and unnatural, and that's really all there is to it. The professor preens unpleasantly and is unable to recognize the originality of Hauser's solution to the problem he posed. The church frightens Hauser with, in the words of the screenplay, ""awful howling."" The priest tries to browbeat him into accepting religion. The aristocrat is only willing to accept Hauser as a well-mannered curiosity, and cannot empathize with his alienation. The bureaucrats coldly dissect Hauser (literally) and come up with an obviously nonsensical pseudo-scientific explanation for his behaviour. Take that, church, state, and science!

None of this is out of the ordinary for Herzog. As we know, he disdains the everyday and seeks the poetic truth. It makes sense that he is unmoved by church hymns -- his worldview is essentially pagan, his films juxtapose larger-than-life, yet mortal deeds with the cold majesty of nature. But he is not usually so blatant about it. And after all, we really come to him for imagery, not ideas. His visuals are brilliant. Even this film makes time for misty Bavarian landscapes (that green-blue dawn in the beginning is to die for), lush rivers and trees, and Kaspar's expressive dream sequences, which briefly make him truly sympathetic.

Unfortunately, that's another problem. I'm sorry to say this -- I love Bruno S. in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stroszek/dp/B000059PPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stroszek</a>,"" for what it's worth, and in ""Kaspar Hauser"" it hurts to see him cry after burning his hand on a candle -- but still, watching a grown, bearded man attempt to remove his clothes during a dinner party makes it difficult to elicit compassion, no matter how you look at it, and I don't even like dinner parties. The aristocrat and his guests may be superficial, but they are trying to be as friendly as their background allows. It pains me to say this, but you can't just expect people to understand you. You also can't expect to receive their pity, help, or respect if you don't make any effort to open some kind of door for them. In ""Stroszek,"" Bruno played a very similar child-like character, who was also lost and bewildered by human coldness, but the difference was that there he was capable of making a desperate attempt to reach out and help someone else.

The film should have ended with the last dream sequence. It wraps up the tragic aspect of the story, and would have left Hauser's image with a lyrical cast. Unfortunately, the film drags on and closes with a hideous brain-chopping scene, not graphic, but still gruesome and repulsive. Maybe Herzog thought he was refusing to be sentimental, committing firmly to a harsh truth. Instead, it comes across as needlessly callous, robbing Hauser of his dignity and reiterating the film's broken-record message about the hypocrisy of society.

It's fascinating to read about the legend of Kaspar Hauser, but in the end I don't think there's much to say about it. Most of the questions surrounding the legend (was Hauser of noble birth?) are more interesting unanswered. As for the philosophical angle, I just don't see Hauser as a noble savage. If everything happened the way it does in this film, I think he was a very unfortunate and unhappy person, but I just don't see how that reflects on human society. It's understandable that Hauser sometimes felt like just giving up, but the film also shows him receiving support from some very good people (Walter Ladengast's character). It does not feel like ""every man for himself,"" as in the original German title.

Well, there's something to be said for the pioneering spirit of seventies cinema. ""Kaspar Hauser"" sometimes becomes unexpectedly poetic, like during the ringmaster's monologue, or with that dream image of people climbing a mountain, which comes out of nowhere. The best thing you can say about it is that it still feels fresh and new, following its own logic rather than viewer expectations. But Herzog's coldness and unwarranted contempt may also show why that spirit didn't last.",1325894400,,5053,5.33375156838143
1655190,5,B00005R248,"The story of this German legend is portrayed in a hauntingly fascinating style that is typical of the body of work of this living legend, Werner Herzog. Herzog has the ability to present his view of life through film in a manner that transcends the narrative, and delivers his characters with luminous complexity and truth. The life story behind the actor in the title role (Bruno S.) adds a layer to the film that further enriches our experience of the portrayal of this mysterious, legendary, enigmatic character, Kaspar Hauser.",1303084800,,530,4.966292134831461
1655191,1,B00005R248,"I was looking for a movie in German, it was advertised, on the cover it states as the language - German it is in English",1242604800,,120,3.84
1655192,5,B00005R248,"When Clemens Scheitz, the scribe from ""Kasper Hauser"", walks away at the end of the film, muttering to himself what a fine report he will make of the mystery of the abandoned young man Kasper Hauser, it is apparent that Werner Herzog is making a statement about missing the forest for the trees.  Or perhaps a more apt analogy would be missing the beauty of the forest because we are too busy counting all the leaves.  Either way, the true enigma, the true mystery surrounding Kasper, according to Herzog, is not so much where he came from and how he existed before being abandoned in the village square, but how a person with no experience whatsoever with the outside world would perceive reality.  What would a bird, a tree, a fellow human seem like to someone who had been locked in a cellar for their entire life?  How would it be different from someone with a normal upbringing?  Would either one be more valid?

At the end of ""Kasper Hauser"", I realized I had watched a very tender movie, one that floated around the edges of my mind for several days after.  I am not a fan of all of Herzog's films, though I do enjoy several of them.  But what makes ""Kasper"" one of his best is the fantastic performance of Bruno S.  I believe Herzog took some flak for casting Bruno, since there was some question of his competancy.  I don't know about that, but I thought he handled the acting chores in both ""Kasper"" and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stroszek/dp/B000059PPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stroszek</a>&nbsp;superbly, and because of Herzog's direction, Bruno's characters emerge with the most humanity, the most dignity.

This film garners high reviews here, and deservedly so, for its thought provoking subject matter and sensuous filmmaking technique.  Someone unfamiliar with Herzog's films might be disappointed after watching though.  This is not your standard Hollywood type movie.  That's not to say one is better than the other - beauty is always in the eye of the beholder - but this is a German film, with English subtitles, and that is enough to discourage some people from watching right there.  The other thing is Herzog's directing style is also different, at times difficult to adjust to.  When he discovers a shot he likes, he lingers.  And lingers.  And lingers some more, until, as a viewer, I'm tempted to shout at the screen, ""Ok, already"".

If you are a Herzog fan, and haven't seen ""Kasper Hauser"", I'd strongly recommend it.  If you are not, but are looking for something different and thought provoking, then it's definitely still recommended, though with the caveat that Herzog's films require a bit of an adjustment if you are used to the mainstream.  With some patience and open-mindedness, though, they can also be just as fulfilling, if not more so.",1231632000,2,2830,4.966029723991507
1655193,5,B00005R248,"It seems that every Herzog film I see is better than the last, and ""The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" continues that trend.  Herzog tells the story of the apparently feral youth who showed up in a Bavarian town in the early 19th century, and of the five years he lived being groomed for ""civilization.""

In Herzog's hands, the tale is a melancholy and occasionally poignant one.  Hauser is unspeakably abused for most of his life by his jailer (his father?), chained to a cellar basement with no human companionship, never having seen the light of day.  Upon his mysterious release, he's barely able to speak or stand, and is viewed as something  between a ""noble savage"" and a monster.  Taken in hand by a kindly doctor, Kaspar gradually learns to speak and to feel and haltingly express sometimes overwhelming emotions when confronted with the beauty of the natural world, music, and poetry.  But he feels trapped inside his own limitations and frustratingly stymied.  As his Sehnsucht deepens, he finds himself increasingly alienated by the civilized world into which he's been cast and the identity that's being forced on him by those authority figures who think they know best.

The depth of Kaspar's soul-hunger is expressed several times throughout the film, but perhaps the most memorable occasion is when he's asked if he ever dreamt during his years of speechless imprisonment.  ""Yes,"" he replies.  ""I dreamt of the Caucasus.""  He dreamt of high, cold, pure places.  In that single line, it seems to me that Herzog captures the mystery, joy, and tragedy of the human longing for transcendence.

The script is excellent, the cinematography entrancing--corn rippling in the wind, Kaspar sucking an egg and gazing out through a crack in the shed where he sits, the interspersions of magic lantern-like images of tall mountain peaks and barren deserts--and the musical score nicely accenturates the scenes and story.  But without a doubt, the center of the film is the incomparable performance of Bruno S. as Kaspar.

Viewers might be interested in comparing Herzog's ""Kaspar"" with Truffaut's ""L'Enfant sauvage.""",1215475200,2,2113,5.063583815028902
1655194,5,B00005R248,"One of the best films I've seen in a while.  This is a very somber true story of a strange young man who suddenly appeared in the middle of Nuremberg, Germany in 1828.  He had been abandoned by his parents and was left locked up alone in a dungeon for 17 years.  He had no human contact other than a man who would come in to periodically clean and feed him (bread and water) like a caged animal.  For whatever reason which was not explained, the man who fed and cleaned him eventually took him out, taught him how to walk and write and discarded him in the middle of town.  This story focuses on his life and interactions with others.  I think the film was beautifully done and it will haunt my memory for a very long time, perhaps forever.

Hauser's character mentioned in the film ""why is everything so difficult for me?"".  Are things much easier for any of us though?  We learned how to do a lot more at a younger age than him, but we all struggle to varying degrees.  Hauser struggles in ways most of us as adults don't, but we struggle in ways he does not.",1206921600,,1061,4.207920792079208
1655195,5,B00005R248,"With ""Kaspar,"" a somber yet engrossing drama accentuated by the lilting strains of Pachelbel's Canon, Herzog found an unusually rich metaphor for man's primitive state. Bruno S., a mental patient taken in by the audacious Teutonic filmmaker, fully embraced the role, refusing even to doff his 19th-century costume at the end of a day's shoot. He plays Kaspar as a perpetually shell-shocked, almost autistic innocent whose strained efforts to communicate and assimilate are thwarted by a profound, perhaps prophetic otherness. The question for Herzog, of course, is whether reason enlightens or imprisons us--an ""Enigma"" well worth pondering.",1183593600,2,641,5.618556701030927
1655196,5,B00005R248,"Every Man For Himself and God Against All aka The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser is a prime slice of pre-nutter-in-the-jungle Werner Herzog and makes an interesting companion piece to Truffaut's L'Enfant Sauvage/The Wild Child. Where Truffaut used his true story of a foundling more animal than boy as proof of the human soul, Herzog uses the real-life mystery of Hauser as a means of showing that society's accepted way of looking at the world may not necessarily be the most valid - as demonstrated when Hauser's contention that apples are tired is seemingly proved by the inability of his guardian to demonstrate that they are inanimate objects subject to man's will.

Thanks as much to a truly alien performance from Bruno S. in the lead role - he really does seem to have suddenly fallen to Earth and not recovered from the shock - as to Herzog's unique mixture of the restrained and the hypnotic in his approach, the end result is one of those films that's definitely greater than the sum of its parts.",1157155200,2,1001,4.72
1655197,5,B00005R248,"Saw this film in the late 70's and it hooked me on Werner Herzog movies.  Agree with the other reviewers as to its humanism, message etc.  This reflects well in the Director's commentary on the DVD since he had to manage Bruno, the ""Kasper"" character as well as direct him because Bruno had such a damaged life (23 years in public institutions/jail).

Want to also recommend the DVD for some of the wonderful and near dreamlike images offered; a field of ripe rye whipped by a swirling wind, a fog-shrouded mountain with weary Irish pilgrims, a temple-covered plain, et. al.  Beautiful as they are, it is the genius of W. Herzog to introduce these short hallucinatory segments as a way to bring to the viewer the sensation of how Kasper perceived a world we see as so familiar, but was all so new to him.",1149120000,4,804,4.524137931034483

To add to his tragic circumstance, he was murdered almost as mysteriously as he was confined.

What makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enigma-of-Kaspar-Hauser/dp/B00005R248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser</a>&nbsp;so compelling is not so much this man's biography. Rather it is Werner Herzog's exploration of the individual's role in society, especially when he has a personal history like Kaspar Hauser. Herzog looks at what would happen to such a person were he to interact with ordinary villagers, children, bureaucrats, clergymen, scientists and educators.

We discover over the course of the film that his perceptions would be different from their own. As he learns to walk, develop language skills, process logic, interpret dreams, understand the concept of God and perform piano solos, we realise what constitutes normalcy and civility according to society. We see man's incessant need to analyse, to explain, to classify and to codify that which is seemingly different than himself. More importantly, we see how individuality is broken and conformity becomes the norm. Not that all men are such cruel and intolerable ogres, Herzog lets us also see the tenderness and kindness humanity possesses.

Herzog's symbolism is quite subtle too. The abrupt cut to a still photograph and silence at the beginning is reflective of Kaspar Hauser's life. It too began peaceably and was cut short. It's a scene that foreshadows and epitomises the events to come.

The symbolism can even be ironic. I was particularly amused at the end when the crippled bureaucrat walks away thinking about Kaspar Hauser's 'abnormal' brain after an autopsy has been performed. Once again, one has to wonder who and what is normal, or so Herzog would have us think.

As you watch the film, you cannot help but feel empathy for Kaspar Hauser. This is owed partly to the performance of Bruno S. He is brilliant. The rigidity, the blank stare, the child-like innocence could perhaps only be depicted by someone who had lived and endured a similar fate. When you see Bruno S., keep in mind he was a 41 year old, non-actor  playing a teenager.  He, himself, had been abused, not unlike Kaspar Hauser, by his mother who was a prostitute; he was sent to an asylum and incarcerated for a petty crime.

Overall, ""The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" is a wonderful film. The DVD  package is not bad either. It comes with a commentary from Werner Herzog synced to the film, if one so wishes.

7952196,4,B00005R248,"this movie is about as real as it gets...in this country today this kind of movie wouldn't have a chance of being made...it didn't have any sex, drugs, or plastic hollywood types!!!",1350691200,,181,4.6875
7952197,5,B00005R248,"Herzog is a bit of a challenge. Not in the sense that his movies are a bit too esoteric, but because they are both very deep and very superficial. He always looks for some bizarre and extreme, not to say gimmicky, situations or characters. It's a bit lazy, as in blockbuster movies that rely on a hook of some large monster. Except here, the monsters are a bit smaller. Yet, he is (or rather was, since nothing beats his movies from the 70's)somehow capable of imbuing his characters with such lyricism and ineffable depth that i feel simply helpless in the face of their magic. He touches something beyond explanation or analysis. He slyly makes fun of the need to explain, analyze, understand and totally abolishes the desire. It's ecstatic existence in its pure form. There's probably no greater example of that strange ability than Kaspar Hauser: a quiet, slow movie with Baroque greatest hits (superficiality alert) that somehow makes perfect sense, even though I have no idea what it means.",1350432000,,996,4.830409356725146
7952198,5,B00005R248,"Reviewer ""Angry Mofo"" always provides an interesting critique of Herzog's films. He calls this one ""closest to a failure"" and among his criticisms is that ""the film should have ended with the last dream sequence"" because...

""It wraps up the tragic aspect of the story, and would have left Hauser's image with a lyrical cast. Unfortunately, the film drags on and closes with a hideous brain-chopping scene, not graphic, but still gruesome and repulsive. [...] It comes across as needlessly callous, robbing Hauser of his dignity and reiterating the film's broken-record message about the hypocrisy of society.""

I agree that the dream sequences were the most poignant and poetic moments of the film, but I strongly disagree that the ending Herzog chose was ""callous"" or un-poetic. In fact, the ending is what I cannot stop thinking about, and it, more than any other scene, forces you to seriously consider Hauser's ideas and visions and perspective, because it so perfectly mocks and robs us of any sort of scientific or material explanation to his ""strange condition."" It is, in fact, one of the best endings I've seen to a Herzog film (others that come to mind are Gesualdo and Cave of Forgotten Dreams), which means it's one of the best endings I've seen to a film, period.",1346544000,2,1277,4.907407407407407
7952199,5,B00005R248,"At the beginning of this film, our eyes are treated to lovely scenes of a small rowboat with a young male (perhaps the director?) dressed in a mid-19th century costume crossing a pond, the reflection on water of a young woman's face (probably Herzog's wife), medieval walls and a tower, and an older woman washing clothes on the shore staring back ... filmed on location in Dinkelsbuhl, a small town in Bavaria (just south of the better-known Rothenburg). Our ears meanwhile are treated to Mozart's music from ""The Magic Flute"" and the entrancing ""Dies Bildnis"" aria sung by Fritz Wunderlich. The words are these:

""Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schn
Wie noch kein Auge je geseh'n!
Ich fhl' es, wie dies Gtterbild
Mein Herz mit neuer Regung fllt,
Mein Herz mit neuer Regung fllt.""

""This image is enchantingly beautiful
As no eye has ever seen!
I feel it, as this divine image
My heart with a new order fills,
My heart with a new order fills.""

And here we enter as charming and true a presentation of the heart of Romanticism as any in cinema. Western civilization was transformed by the new vision embodied in works such as ""The Magic Flute,"" Beethoven's 9th Symphony and the ""Heiliger Dankegesang"" (""Holy Song of Thanks"") of his 15th String Quartet, and Goethe's ""Sorrows of Young Werther,"" the paintings of Casper David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge, the poetry of Novalis, and of course the works of Rousseau, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, and many more ....

The tale is based on recorded events which began one morning in 1828 in a Nuremberg square as an unkempt adolescent is discovered, evidently unable to speak or understand language, and holding a mysterious letter. Some scenes are invented in the film, but much was recorded as the youth was eventually adopted by a doctor and taken to nearby Ansbach where he became a cause clbre famous throughout Europe. He was seen by some as the embodiment of the noble savage ideal, of the natural innocence and goodness with which we enter this beautiful, strange, dangerous world only to be abused, corrupted, deranged, encrusted by obsolete but still powerful conventions, where hostile and petty minds are all too omnipresent ... unless through imagination and art we can recover the innate innocence and goodness to transform ourselves and this world, and so on ...

Indulge in this sensibility if only as an exercise of imagination, nostalgia and empathy, a journey to a lost world which nonetheless still lurks in (maybe) all of us and still trying to get out -- we who are more level-headed, rational, cold-hearted, jaded. Let yourself experience Fernweh, the yearning, ache, almost painful, for distant, exotic places, the imagining of which inflames the soul and spurs Sehnsucht, the ache, the longing for that which is just beyond the edge of imagination and conceptualization, insatiable perhaps and otherworldly ... and so on ...

Kasper's grave is still there, well cared for, in Ansbach, as is the memorial at the spot where he was stabbed, and a museum still displays his writings and clothes he wore. Bruno S., a sometime street musician and psychiatric clinic client, though no longer an adolescent for this film, was the perfect one to play the role. See and hear him make music and sing in his old age via the NY Times: a December 24, 2008 multimedia report titled ""From Berlin's Hole of Forgottenness, a Spell of Songs.""

At the film's end, the ""Magic Flute"" aria concludes:

""Dies' etwas kann ich zwar nicht nennen,
Doch fhl' ichs hier wie Feuer brennen.
Soll die Empfindung Liebe sein?
Ja, ja, die Liebe ist's allein.
Die Liebe ist's allein""

""I cannot name this something,
Though I feel it here like fire burning,
Could this infection be love?
Yes! Yes! Love it is alone!
Love it is alone!""",1329955200,,3766,4.862714508580344
