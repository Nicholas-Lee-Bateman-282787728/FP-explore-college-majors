1406476,5,B000059HIS,"What can I say?  This movie is a winner!  Mary-Kate & Ashley's acting is amazing!  This is the best movie since ""It Takes Two"".  It's definately their best in the latest wave of Olsen movies.  It has everything-  Comedy (yes, you will laugh, and laugh a LOT!) - Romance - Suspence - Some nice outtakes on classic entertainers like James Bond and The Beatles.  Did I mention Mary-Kate & Ashley's acting?  Yes!  Top-notch.  You will not be disappointed!  I sure wasn't!",985651200,,467,4.6419753086419755
1406477,4,B000059HIS,"The Olsen twins are getting older now....as are their movies. This movie was very cute and would be enjoyable for kids, teens, and adults to watch. Their other movies are very childish and elementary, but this one takes their movies on a new level. Well done, girls!",985651200,,266,4.680851063829787
1406478,5,B000059HIS,I think the olsen twins are awesome. This movie is going to be great. I can't wait to buy it. The Olsen Twins are the best!!!,983232000,2,125,3.8461538461538463
1406508,3,B000059HIS,"This a fair movie to watch.  Not much as far as traveling around London.  If you like the Olsen Twins you may like this Movie.  ""Passport to Paris"" is a better movie.",1383091200,,166,4.125
1406509,4,B000059HIS,"Yes, it's the Olsen twins but it's better than we all expected.  It's funny, has some culture, showcases London highlights, and is worth the hour and a half if you're looking for a fun family movie without objectionable content.",1382400000,,228,4.846153846153846
1406510,5,B000059HIS,Appropriate for a tween. She really enjoyed it. Too bad they changed because of fame. These can be watched with no worries.,1380412800,,123,4.636363636363637

1406515,3,B000059HIS,"cute, mindless fluff but more for teens. I was looking for mindless, something i didn't have to think about. this fit the bill. just cute.",1378512000,,138,4.56
1406516,2,B000059HIS,"It looks like a film written and directed by teenagers, but not creative ones.  My daughter left the room and did something else.  It didn't have any of the charm of the younger Olsen twin movies, and it was not sophisticated enough to appeal to a more mature crowd.",1378252800,,266,4.408163265306122
1406517,2,B000059HIS,Too slow moving.  I thought the plot was lame and I could not connect with the characters or the plot.,1378166400,,102,4.1
1406557,5,B000059HIS,My sister and I are now taking part in Model UN in college. We watched these movies as kids and can't wait to have the Model UN Sister experience! ^_^,1377734400,,150,4.033333333333333
1406558,3,B000059HIS,"Plot: the twins compete in Model UN and are offered to attend the international Model UN debate team in London. There, each character faces the importance and prioritization of matters around the world and in their personal life.

1. The plot moved along fairly smoothly
2. Dialogue was pretty believable for youths of that age
3. This is narrated throghout the movie by the Olsen twins with ""freeze-frame"" commentary
4. This is a cute movie to have younger kids and teens watch, it could be a family movie but save family night for a good old fashioned Disney movie (especially a newer one that has adult innuendos at least)!
5. Interesting cast, you'll notice Chase from the tv show House, Eric Jungman from many of today's crime-drama tv shows plus a few more from 90's tv shows!

1406559,4,B000059HIS,The movie was entertaining the plot was cute another pretty typical Olsen twin movie. My daughter enjoyed the theme and the story.,1376611200,,130,4.954545454545454
1406560,1,B000059HIS,Not very entertaining. I think they would be better off on some ride at Disney World or Disney land. Maybe in Tokyo Disney Land,1372982400,,127,4.333333333333333
1406561,5,B000059HIS,"My girls are 10 and 12 and they really enjoyed this movie.  They had to watch it more than once.  They liked the fact that the movie took place in London (because they are crazy about 1Direction so anything to do with England is high on their list) and they enjoyed the ""romance"" in the movie.  It was age appropriate for them so I didn't mind that they thought it had romance in it.",1372723200,,383,4.148648648648648
1406562,3,B000059HIS,"This movie was okay, but it really was a teenager's movie. The pictures of London were nice. It was like sightseeing in London with teenagers.",1371686400,,142,4.72
1406563,4,B000059HIS,I was surprised by this movie normally in the Olsen twins movies Ashley's character  is the driven one and Mary-Kate's is the flaky one. In Winning London it was the opposite. I would recommend this to any fan of the Olsen's or anybody who likes comedies.,1371081600,,255,4.543478260869565
1406564,5,B000059HIS,I bought this movie for my 9 year old daughter who is in love with any Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson movies !  She as so surprised when she received it as a Christmas present :),1358121600,,174,3.9714285714285715
1406565,1,B000059HIS,I live in Alabama and this DVD said wrong region code. Could not use. Very disappointed. Took FOREVER to get here.,1338595200,,114,4.476190476190476
1406602,3,B000059HIS,"This movie was a bit slow and there were a lot of useless shots that the director suggested to use in order to showcase London. Don't get me wrong there were a lot of great shots of London as well but there was an excess of footage that didn't need to be there. This made the story drag a bit. In conclusion it fell together well by the end. Well, if you're 11- 15 years old maybe. So far their best movie is Passport To Paris. Holiday In The Sun was terrible but that's probably because the twins directed that film. So I'll recommend this film, only if you're truly bored. :) I love Mary Kate and Ashley though.",1251763200,,613,4.159663865546219
1406603,5,B000059HIS,"This isn't Shakespeare, but it's a very fun video.  The guys in this one are the best looking of any video Mary-Kate and Ashley have had so far.  The plot is predictable, but it has- as with all Olsen twins movies- a happy ending, and will leave you with a happy feeling.

My roomate and I fell in love with it when it first came out, and we're still watching it many years later!",1168387200,,380,4.108108108108108
1406604,3,B000059HIS,"I don't know how that movie even got to my house, I'm pretty sure my parents rented it. Since it was already in my house I decided to watch it. It's an okay movie. Mary-Kate and Ashley are cute as always. And of course they have pretty good boyfriends also. It's a great movie to watch with bunch of friends, girlfriends.",1150761600,,321,4.278688524590164
1406605,1,B000059HIS,"Oh dear Lord, yet another movie that stereotypes Brits. Yes, we must all be rich and own large expanses of land and oh, yeah, we must ALL live in London. If I were one of those poor guys, I would be severely tempted to mug Mary-Kate and Ashley, which is far more likely. An unoriginal movie, which is really sad. I am quite sure there is someone out there willing to write an original plotline for these two and they might just refrain from ruining it. But really...isn't it funny how American's still think us English are completely up ourselves? We're not! Really! And I, for one, do not own half a county and have an incredibly rich relative. I'm not that offended at being constantly depicted as wealthy, neither are my mates, but, hmm, if you're going to put it in the title, couldn't you at least research the place a bit...?",1084492800,5,831,4.437908496732026
1406606,4,B000059HIS,"Mary-Kate and Ashely Olsen are simply two of the hottest rising stars.  Well actually they're no rising stars, they've practically been stars since they were adolescents on a funny sitcom called Full House.  They're career started off to a huge success.  They soon made movies, tv shows, and apparrel of all sorts.
  Winning London, which was relased in 2001, was another typical Mary-Kate and Ashley film.  I have to say for its nice locations, it's worth a look.  But the movie's plot is pretty formulaic and similiar to all their other movies, which can be a bit boring as well disappointing.  So you wonder why I honored this movie with 4 stars, I just can't get it out my head to be honest.  Ever since they showed it on the MK & A marathon on ABC Family on New Year's Eve of 2003, I became upssesed with it.  Infact, I thought of buying on DVD,  I still haven't yet.  There's just something about the movie with is so attractive, I suppose it's Mary-Kate and Ashley, I just like the film and the setting too.
  The plot, I don't even know why I'll bother is simple as anything.  Mark Kate and Ashley play Chloe and Riley, not like on their show So Little Time, which is the opposite.  They're participating in a United Nations game/contest.  They are the winners of the preliminary competition and are asked if they'd like to compete in the real competition in London.  Of course they agree and are sent to London, where they meet cute guys who they hang out it.  Jesse Spencer plays Mary-Kate's love interest James.  Oddly enough Jesse Spencer is Australian and is being portrayed as British.  There are a few sterotypes and/or flaws in this movie.  What movie doesn't have flaws?
  The film is rated G for General Audiences.  It contains nothing extreme obviously.  Mild sexual innuendo, mainly some kissing.  No profanity obviously.  A fine pick for all ages.
All in all entertaining, and am looking forward to Mark-Kate and Ashley big screen debut, New York Minute due to be released in May.  See Winning London, I suggest renting it first.",1074297600,2,2050,4.632311977715878
1406643,2,B000059HIS,"As sugary Mary Kate and Ashley movies go, this was OK, but I thought the ending was too predictable, and the portrayal of London and the English was so bad it was hysterical. The actor, Jesse Spencer, who played Riley(Mary Kate)'s boyfriend was so obviously NOT English, that it was no surprise to discover he was Australian. Nobody in England speaks like that, and most English kids don't have fancy luncheons and play polo on the weekends! It was gnerally poorly done, but then again, most American movies about London are. I just think that if the plot was spruced up a bit and the footage of London (and the accents) were made A LOT better, it would be a great film.
....",1064880000,,675,4.495934959349594
1406644,5,B000059HIS,"UPDATED VERSION- I AM NOW 13
  It has the perfect mix of romance, comedy and adventure. Mary-Kate's performance was brilliant and Jesse Spencer (James) is so hot! Ashley did well too. The soundtrack is also quite good, (again Holiday In The Sun's is better) but lacks pop and R'n'B.
This is really good, better than Getting There and so on, mainly because the girls don't act dumb and this has an original storyline. Anyway, the PLOT: Chloe (Mary-Kate, this time) and Riley (Ashley)are taking part in Model U.N., that particular year taking part in London, England. Chloe is the intelligent one and Riles just wants to have fun. But it is a great film. If you have not already, I urge you to CHECK THIS OUT!",1054771200,,707,4.603174603174603
1406645,5,B000059HIS,"I have always loved the Olsen twins, but living in England was always left watching ancient spin offs of two of a kind and ancient films like passport to paris, so when I saw Winning London I snapped it up straight away and I'm glad I did. Winning London shows the girls inn a new light, they've grown up, so I'd say that Winning London is more for teens, than tweens. If you love teen movies and the Olsens this is the film for you, but you may be surprised at how different it is from there past films, but do not thret this new formula is better than ever!",1052697600,,559,4.090909090909091
1406646,5,B000059HIS,"This movie is soooo good! At first i thought i wasn't going to like it but this is Mary-Kate & Ashley's best movie. The movie is really sweet and has 2 really charming guys in it :) I would recommend it to everyone. The movie is mostly for the teens. I'll promise you, you'll enjoy it!",1050796800,,285,4.107142857142857
1406647,5,B000059HIS,"When Riley and Chloe's high school's UN team wins the scholarship for public schools, their team is sent to England to compete with other teams from all over the world. When Riley joins the team, making Chloe step down as the best person on their UN team, she has to learn to share the spotlight with her little sister. When Brazil's team ends up with the same country as their's, they must find a new country, conquer the competition and win the attention of all the hot guys, all in time for tea.
I loved this movie because I really love England, learning about the world and Mary-Kate and Ashley movies; this movie was just my type! Not only did I have fun watching this, but I also learned some facts (if they were true) from the UN competitions! The plot was also believable in this movie, making it even more realistic for me to watch. This is such a great movie, that I think it is Mary-Kate and Ashley's greatest movie ever!",1049846400,,932,4.393063583815029
1406648,4,B000059HIS,"This movie is probably the best Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.
Of corse, you may be wondering why. Because, lets face it, Mary-Kate and Ashley haven't given use anything truely entertaining, with the exseption of there show SO LITTLE TIME in a long time. The reason this movie is so good is that it actuly has a balievable plot. And the fact that the sisters are real. They are friends but they still get on each others nerves. Like real sisters. Of corse there are the traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley personifications in this movie, cute boys, and shopping. But the shopping scene is limited to one (thank goodness), and the ""cute boys"" actuly have personalities (I know its hard to balieve, but true), they are real characteres. Not just somthing realy good to look at. Its nice to have character development once in a wile, (actually is always nice). Ultimately this film out ways all the other Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movies. So, if you have a tast for Mary-Kate and Ashely films this is a must see.",1047254400,,1010,4.679775280898877
1406691,3,B000059HIS,"Winning London is an alright movie
The twins were great in it expecially ashley who played Riley.
Mary-kate was well she acted a bit old and waaaaaaaay tooo serious for her age. Ashley was just normal like a 15 year old girl would be you know. The storyline was a bit far fetched didn't like it that much. Oh and Mary-kate's boyfriend was a bit stuck up so i can only give this 3 stars.",1041724800,,386,4.16
1406692,4,B000059HIS,You should watch this movie. It is not like the rest. They have at least have something in it that is educational. They have kissing in the movies. They have the best guys. And they don't need the money. But we really like the movie. It has adventure and we really like it.,1027555200,,273,4.169811320754717
1406693,3,B000059HIS,"Okay, I have to admit that the Olsen Twins normally really really bug me. I used to watch their mystery videos when I was little, but since watching Passport to Paris about 11 billion times when babysitting, the twins have begun to grate on my last nerve. So I was surprised to find that when I watched Winning London on tv one day, I actually liked most of it. Of course, it had some required Mary-Kate and Ashley hokey-ness, puppy love, and schlock, but I thought it was fun, and surprisingly amusing. The acting was above par for their movies, largely in part to Jesse Spencer's great portrayal of James, a love interest (of course)and the rest of the debate team. The teen actors were very accomplished. My favorite character though, has to be Dylan, the strange, third wheel vidfreak who is one of the team members. Dylan is played hysterically by Erc Jungmann of 'Not Another Teen Movie'. Overall, Winning London was an Olsen Twins movie, complete with the soppy sweet closing shot of the young lovers riding away into the sunset on horses. But it was an enjoyable one.",1025654400,,1075,4.633507853403142
1406694,4,B000059HIS,"Winning London is not one of my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley movies but it is still good because these girls are great.  The movie starts with the girls' national relations team winning a trip to London.  While there, of course the girls fall in love with two stunningly handsome boys, but while coupling up they must study for their contest.  The group is very creative throughout the contest, but will their relationships cause a loss for their team??  Watch this great adventure to find out how the girls Win London!",1024790400,,520,4.7444444444444445
1406695,5,B000059HIS,"I absolutley enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.
Ashley who is pining over Brian(plays Travis in their new series)while Chloe is head over heels for this prince charming James(Jesse Spencer,Aussie).I like the moments between Riley(MK) and James the most, because they have a few heart to hearts, and it is really sweet. I also like when they are in  the club dancing to this crazy sounding music, and James is dancing so goofy(too cute). I appreciated that the movie tried to teach that winning isn't everything(Ex:Riley and James playing polo). I love the history that is shown in this movie, also. Westminster abbey is filmed with Mary Queen of Scots' tomb, and some others. I didn't feel like this movie was made by an american director, but by a european director that brought England to the viewer. It was sort of mod, but at the same time had a very fashionable, Euro ambiance.",1024185600,2,889,4.7727272727272725
1406696,5,B000059HIS,"Okay, I'm not going through all the details, but if you want a movie that is just a feel-good film, not a whole bunch of shooting, sex, and drugs, this is perfect. I love the movie and I've seen it 4 times in the last 2 days. Watch it, and love it",1023840000,,247,3.769230769230769
1406697,5,B000059HIS,"This movie was great! I absoultly loved the plot and the setting! London shined! Mary-Kate and Ashley win a free trip to London after winning a Model United Nations contest. They run into a few problems, but they works through them. They meet cute quys, which happens in all of their movies. It's a great movie and MAry-Kate and Ashley play their roles extrememly well and they put alot of effort into their parts. It's an excellent movie that can only be rated 5 stars!!",1023753600,,471,4.552941176470588
1406726,5,B000059HIS,"Considering that I've not seen every single Olsen twins movie, WINNING LONDON is the best by far. It's about twins Chloe Lawrence (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Riley Lawrence (Ashley Olsen) who are off to London, England! How did they do that? To start off, Chloe is the captain of her school's Modal UN team. The Model UN is a international competition for students who are assigned different countries to debat on their issues and problems. Riley joined the team after Chloe's team won the national competition to compete in the international competition. One of Chloe's members had to drop out of the trip, so Riley volunteered just to get close to one of the team's members--Brian (Brandon Tyler). Chloe cares more about winning than boys. But once in England, Chloe comes across James Browning (Jesse Spencer), a very cute British guy who's from a rival team! There are sparks almost instantly between Chloe and James, but the heat of the competition makes it difficult for them to begin a relationship, especially when James's father finds out about Chloe and doesn't want any girls to get into James's way of winning.
Another Olsen twins flick of beautiful scenary--this one was filmed in London. The acting is good, and Jesse Spencer is very, very cute! He does an excellent British accent, even though he's Australian in real life. Brandon Tyler, who plays Brian, is also very cute! I'd say that so far, WINNING LONDON has the best-looking boys in it. Another highly recommended flick for all Olsen twins fans!",1018828800,3,1511,4.90625

1406728,5,B000059HIS,This was the best Mary-Kate & Ashley movie I've seen in my whole life! I liked in so much because it was in London and I've been to London. I also like how the people who picked the actors picked that cute(really hot) guy to be James. I also really liked the music. It rocked!,1017705600,,276,4.036363636363636

1406731,3,B000059HIS,Winning London is probably the worst olsen movie that i have seen yet.  The story is sketchy and the camera work in the film gets very irratating.  I have watched lots of Mary-Kate and Ashley movies but this one has got to be thier worst.  I think if you are looking for a better Olsen movie then choose 'Our Lips are Sealed' as it has got a much better story line.  However i think any movie with Mary-Kate and Ashley in it has got to be worth 3 Stars as they are extremely talented and look fantastic.,1010448000,,503,4.154639175257732
1406760,5,B000059HIS,"This movie is the best Mary-Kate and Ashley movie yet. I do not see what u people are talking about with the toooo much kissing. Their is only about 3 or 4 kisses in this whole movie. That is perfectly normal for any movie. This movie obvesly takes place in London. Chloe, played my Mary-Kate, and Riley, played by Ashley, go to London for a Modal U.N. compotition with 3 other people, but for different reasons. Chloe goes because she won California in Modal U.N. and she wants to win world. Riley goes because there is an open spot on the team and she is dieing to get the attention of her crush Brain who is also in Modal U.N. I don't want to say any move cause I might get carried away and give away the ending, so I am not. I rented this movie for 2 days and watched about 6-8 times. My sisters and I loved it. Brothers no way. Hope this helped.

1406761,5,B000059HIS,"Hello. I would like to so called ""Back Up"" Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in this movie. What I am basically saying is that M K or Chica or whatever is so totally wrong. Come on. Kids under 10 can so watch this movie my 6 year old sister and all her friends love this movie. and there is NOT, I repeat, NOT a lot of kissing in this movie. It is like anyother Mary-Kate and Ashley movie totally harmless. Both Mary-Kate and Ashley kiss kiss once. And then the other people kiss so that is like what? 3. Its like omg. Anyone under 6 is so going to die if they see people kiss 3 times. Barney probally kiss more times then that. It is more like the best Mary-Kate and Ashley movie. And Our Lips Are Sealed is the same thing except that they are is Australia rather than Paris. The just talk to the camrea the whole time. And it woundn't be a family movie even without the kissing because sure I will so be able to seat my mom and dad down to watch a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie. This movie is for people more like the ages of 5-13. And by the way their naems are Mary-Kate and Ashley NOT MKA. Dah.
Bye
P.S. You don't have to purchase this ""item"", movie. Have u ever heard of Blockbuster. Rent It. If I puchased every movie I saw I woundn't be able to get into my house.",998006400,2,1261,4.048
1406762,5,B000059HIS,"I thought this was a great movie because I think it was the first movie they had a kiss with a boy and they have lots of fun in London, England. I like their names they are called Riley and Chloe. Riley is trying to kiss this boy called Brian and this is how Chloe gets her boyfriend - a boy comes out of the toilet with toilet paper on his shoe and then Chloe comes along and takes it off him with her shoes.

Well, this IS a great movie, definitely in my Top 3, and I loved the plot (""Who's your father?"" ""Lord... Voldemort.""  ""Who needs nukes anyway?"" ""We do!""  ""To him, I'll always be the girl who ralphed on a bald guy!"")  This is by far the Olsen Twins' best work since Full House (and they were what, 4?  They just had to be cute!) I'm glad they finally got it that you need to be able to act once you're over the age of six and you can't depend on your cuteness anymore... especially when you don't have any anymore :o)  But seriously, 5-star movie from some 3-star actresses... ut that one guy that Chloe?  Riley?  whichever, likes (the american one with brown hair)mmmmmmmmm, hottness!!",997401600,,786,4.531914893617022
1406764,5,B000059HIS,"This is definitely the best Olsen film yet. As a fan of over ten years, I expect a lot from Mary-Kate and Ashley and they still continue to surprise me. At first I didn't like Winning London very much. I felt it was too different from their previous productions. But as Mary-Kate and Ashley grow up, so must their movies, and the second time I saw this movie, I realized how great it was.  This is the best Olsen movie ever. If you are a fan and haven't seen it yet, you are nuts!  Do yourself a favour and see 'Winning London'!!!!!",996537600,,532,4.205882352941177
1406765,1,B000059HIS,"This has got to be one of the worst Olsen movies I've ever seen.  Sure, it has a better plot then Passport to Paris, where they just run around with boys, but really, this is just Mary-Kate and Ashley hanging out infront of the camera.  There are much better movies of the twins, this does not show their potential - no wonder people find them annoying.  This movie is not a family movie, or for anyone under the age of 10 - too much kissing, etc...  Try ""Our Lips are Sealed,"" ""Billboard Dad,"" or ""to grandmother's house we go"" if you're looking for a MKA movie.  Thanks for your time, and I hope you make the right choice when choosing to purchase this item.",996451200,3,660,4.290322580645161
1406766,5,B000059HIS,"What can I say?! I loved this movie!! I went to blockbuster and rented Erin Brockovich while my 8 year old brother rented this movie! I agreed to let him watch his 1st, well I don't think I ever watched Erin Brockovich!! I must have watched it atleast 12 times!! I've grown up watching these 2 girls from Full house to to this movie... And this one is DEFINITLY their best work!! The only bad thing is that it isn't on DVD and wasn't nominated for an award!! It's the best family movie even my mother the harshest of all critics liked it! I recommend it for all ages!! My favourite part was when they kissed it made my heart jump... anyways rent it, you'll love it!!!",996451200,,667,4.25984251968504
1406814,3,B000059HIS,"I enjoyed this movie and have watched it many times and I would say as many people have, that the quality of Olsen twin movies is improving. However I would say that Our lips are sealed is by far the better quality movie. The reason I've had to give this my lowest rating on an Olsen movie is probably because I'm from England so watching the dump I live in isn't exactly thrilling (they captured the English weather so well), and then in American film tradition the MISTAKES. However the odd mistake in our history I don't mind and really don't care (they've mainly got dates wrong). Finally one of the main characters in it is acted by an Australian (who anyone from England would know) but plays a well spoken English lad (why not use an English actor?) the accent is too posh and then he slips up and you can tell his Australian. Also knowing how old he is made certain scenes hard to watch (he's quite a bit older than Mary-kate Olsen).  Mistakes aside this is an enjoyable movie. It is also one of the most realistic films I've ever seen when it come to hostage negotiation, also a very funny scene. I still recommend this film.",995414400,,1134,4.4

He is so hot, that if someone touched him(which I want to do) they'd burn to death. I say that this one gets FAME! Well, my review is done.

1406816,5,B000059HIS,This was the best Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Movie. And I've  watched it over and over. But it doesn't get boaring because I  like watching them. And the best part of the movie is when they  dress up like boys and snuck into a mens club.,993686400,,237,4.108695652173913
1406817,5,B000059HIS,"This movie is the best. It is about two sisters Riley and Chloe who go to London along with 3 other people from their school and perticipate in the Modal U.N. compoition. This movie is different from all other Mary-Kate and Ashley movies becuase the girls Riley and Chloe are totally different and a lot of times don't get along. In Winning London it is the first Mary-Kate and Ashley movie where they are not perfect and their lives don't depend on lip gloss, they are actully somewhat smart in this movie. Winning London is also a very, very funny movie in many ways! This movie also teaches people that their dreams can come true. You should rent or buy this movie today. One thing is that in every Olsen Twins movie they BOTH have to fall in love with someone, this movie has no exaptions to that fact.",993686400,10,806,4.416107382550336
1406818,5,B000059HIS,I really thought that this movie was great. It is different from all their other movies. This movie is better for a teenage Olsen fan rather than a younger fan because there are a few kissing scenes. This movie won me BIG!!!,992649600,,224,4.357142857142857

They are great actresses.  This movie is another great movie that they did. It is really funny and cute. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO EVERYONE!!!",989107200,,295,4.175438596491228
1406820,4,B000059HIS,"I think this movie will help win more fans for the Olsen Twins.  It is a very good story.  One more movie that helps in getting people to think of the the girls as Teen Actresses and not just the twins from Full House.  Nice to see them acting their age, not pretending to be older, and not faking it to still look like little girls either.
I only have a small complaint in the movie.  They wasted time with the sightseeing part. Just by looking at the movie, you have a chance to see all the cool stuff in London.  The best part of the movie is the last part that deals with the model United Nations.  This could have been expanded more.  OLAS is better in this respect, more time for the plot, and less sightseeing of Sidney.  This is why I gave it only 4 of 5 stars",987638400,,768,4.039735099337748
1406850,4,B000059HIS,"Our lips are sealed was a great step forward in making higher quality Olsen movies, Winning London is another step ahead! When I read about Winning London at first, I expected a Passport to Paris clone, thank goodness I was wrong! The movie doesn't have the feeling of an Olsen movie, and that's a very good thing. Mary-Kate and Ashley must be in it, but their presence should not overshadow all and everything else. Also the words ""Model UN"" really confused me, I was thinking of fashion modeling all the time, not diplomacy (I must admit that I never could lay the link between fashion and the UN though)!  The story of the movie is quite boring, except for the James Bond like scenes, where Riley and Brian are going to try to rescue the ""hostages"" (it's all a setup - I like the guy who plays Iraq! UK: ""Who needs nukes anyway?"" Iraq: ""We do!""). Although the story is a bit boring, there IS a story line (unlike movies as Passport to Paris). The plot line is even quite advanced for an Olsen movie, although it didn't really appeal to me. I prefer a bit more action, a bit more things to see, and a bit less talk. That's probably why I really liked the James Bond scene, shame it wasn't a bit longer. The movie appeared very mature, except for the scene in which Chloe and Riley tried to sneak into a meeting as guys was so totally fake! It instantly reduced the level of the movie. That scene would have been nice in a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie when they were 8, but not anymore. There were many good parts in the movie to compensate this though. The characters of Mary-Kate and Ashley were not so close-goodie-best-friends-for-life as they usually are, and they got a lot of scenes separately. Also, it weren't just Chloe and Riley, they were part of a group of 5+James and every member in that group got nearly the same amount of screentime, and they clearly formed three ""love couples"". The cover of the videobox is quite refreshing too, compared with Billboard dad, Passport to Paris and Our lips are sealed (those three movies have very similar boxes). There are not much jokes in the movie. They few which are in it are mostly coming from Dylan. There are also a few direct pointers to Our lips are sealed, and in the sound-track the song So little time is used, of course pointing towards the new show by Mary-Kate and Ashley with the same title, expected June 2001. Speaking of music, the non-vocal soundtrack often reminded me of It takes two.
In spite of the not so interesting story is Winning London another great step forward in the quality of Olsen movies and expansion of Mary-Kate and Ashley's audience, although the job is still far from finished (big screen movies might help). Mary-Kate and Ashley were great in it! Seems like they're getting better all the time.",987206400,6,2788,4.531746031746032

1406854,5,B000059HIS,"The Olsens continue to please their fans with another fun film.  Winning London obviously takes place in the UK, where the girls and their Model UN team compete in a UN international competition for high school students.  In order to learn about their host country, a very cute, very rich London boy, who just happens to be Mary Kate's love interest, gives the group of American teens a tour of the city.
A most refreshing change occurs in Winning London in that Mary Kate and Ashley are depicted as two very distinct individuals; different hair styles, different clothes, different aspirations, all of which makes us see them as two sisters who look alike, but are clearly different people.  This is a very positive alteration, one that I think audiences were ready for.  An aspect that remains true Olsens however, is their friendship together.
It was great to showcase some other fine young talent; the friend with the video camera was amazingly good, and Ashley's love interest was indeed a babe.  This movie had the feel of Dawson's Creek, but with more style.

I also liked the plot line for this movie better than OLAS--which i thought was too fake a story line, but stuff like MUN actually happens. the one dissappointment though was that ashley had one line that was EXACTLY the same in OLAS and WL ""I know I know, but he's so cute!"" that was my one disappointment, but otherwise GREAT MOVIE",985996800,,595,4.351351351351352

I only had one disappointment with this movie, the fact that all the English people in it were either really posh or cockney. And Jesse Spencer is australian not English and I for one do not speak like that and nor does anyone I know but dispite this, it was a gr8 film.
