2767588,4,B000NDI4X4,"In this Cold War movie a former Air Force pilot with the nickname ""Wrong-Way Goldfarb"" crashes his CIA U-2 about as far as he could get from the Soviet Union... Fawzia! Fawzia is an extremely rich Arab kingdom which has all kinds of oil reserves. One thing it DOESN'T have is a U.S. air base, despite its strategic importance.

King Fawz is a lecherous old man whose palace is filled with toy trains and a huge harem, which now includes the reporter who originally gave Goldfarb his nickname in the press. Goldfarb himself is given the choice of either helping Fawzia build up an American football team or being sent to Moscow, along with his U-2. Hilarity ensues.

A fun movie, although not exactly Lawrence of Arabia (watch for scenes mimicking that classic film) it nevertheless can be entertaining at times... if a little heavy-handed in some of the jokes.",1387756800,,860,4.726666666666667
2767589,5,B000NDI4X4,"Even though I didn't get this movie due to it's ISBN number having been reassigned (yes, it is that old), the seller was very gracious and refunded my money immediately.  I really wanted this movie, too.  Anything with Shirley MacLaine in it prior to that sappy-sad cancer-struck daughter movie is a gem!",1385337600,3,304,4.826923076923077
2767590,4,B000NDI4X4,"With its bright colors, comic book production design, cheery smuttiness - and the irrepressible Olive Oyle limbs of Shirley MacClaine - this seems like a forgotten Frank Tashlin picture, lacking only Tashlin's delirious flights into surrealism (although a penguin riding a toy train through a chintzy bedroom comes awfully close).  Blunt Cold War satire is the basic game plan. Pilot ""Wrongway"" Goldfarb (in for a penny, in for a pound every-klutz Richard Crenna) on a secret mission to the USSR crash-lands in the sand and oil kingdom of Fawzia. Randy King Fawz (Ustinov) recruits / blackmails Goldfarb--after forgiving him his Jewishness--to coach a Bedouin football team against the Fighting Irish, in vengeance for Notre Dame's slight against Fawzia's son.  Shirley Maclaine is an undercover journalist who is the object of Fawz's lust and Goldfarb's scorn.  That's about it in the plot department.

The movie features an all-star offense line-up of mid-60s TV and old Hollywood farceurs: State Department bunglers Harry Morgan, Jerome Cowan, Richard Deacon, and Fred Clark (who as the head of the CIA, Heinous Overreach, gets his best stuff at the end as a crooked ref.  Yes, Heinous Overreach. This is not a film of frothy nuance. This is not Jacques Tati.)  Jim Backus (driven to drink) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (as the sheik's nanny-like factotum) are given some of the best bits of business. Charles Lane and an uncredited Telly Savalas have spicy cameos.

But the movie belongs to Peter Ustinov whose Arabic patois and squint-eyed horniness guarantee a chuckle at every appearance. He zooms through the palace in a rocket engine go-cart, mumbling manically, pinching harem girls, a perpetual motion machine of coitus interruptus for the Crenna-MacLaine menage.

As a bonus--for me at least--the movie takes down Notre Dame, unfairly and unsquarely.  The release of the movie was delayed by a defamation suit from Notre Dame.  The boys in Blue and Gold--represented by humor-free he-man Scott Brady--are blockheaded crew-cut all-American doofi, easily awed by veiled vixens and gut-punched by stuffed mongoose.  The movie ends in an ejaculation of oil on a football field in the desert which neatly sums up 50 years of Middle East diplomatic incursions.

The movie was too crass and heavy-handed for the critics of its time. Now we can sit back and lick our chops at the candy-colored excess.  I saw this when I was a 10 year old boy and thought it was swell, without getting the little references to T.S. Eliot or Rimsky Korsakov.  If you fish around on the Internets you can find some versions.  Summon up your inner 10 year old boy and have fun!  When Ustinov attacks Shirley MacLaine, she says something like, ""Would you rather beat Notre Dame or have sex?""  He pauses, then channels his best Yul Brynner: ""Is a puzzlement.""",1369094400,5,2835,5.06236559139785
2767591,5,B000NDI4X4,"This oldie moldie was one that we searched for, and could only find thru Amazon! A hilarious romp, Shirley Maclaine is so funny, good supporting cast,beautiful costumes. However, it could be considered lnsulting to Arabic folks. If this doesn't bother you, see it by all means!!LB",1316908800,7,280,5.108695652173913
8177435,5,B000NDI4X4,"John (Wrongway) Goldfarb (Richard Crenna), is involved in our defense is a U2 pilot. He is in the process of surveying Russia when is with everything else in his life something always goes wrong; in this case it was his plane. He is forced to bail out over Fawzi Arabia. The reason that he actually got his nickname Wrongway is because he used to be in football and ran the wrong way.

Jenny Ericson (Shirley MacLaine),'Strife' Magazine reporter, just happened to be undercover as a harem girl. She wants out and he wants to go home; so they ban together as both are desired for their abilities by King Fawz (Peter Ustinov.) King Fawz wants to build a football team to play against Notre Dame for rejecting his son. And you can imagine what he wants harem girl Jenny for.

The background music might be a little annoying but this is the song from the movie ""John Goldfarb Please Come Home."" However Peter Ustinov does such good character acting that it makes up for any shortcoming you may find in this presentation.",1511827200,6,1016,4.576923076923077
8177436,4,B000NDI4X4,"Comedy that moves along without any flab in the editing.  Nearly a visual or verbal gag in every scene, if not every shot.  Even if the story is a bit silly, there are topical references to the times.  A sheik blackmails a downed pilot into coaching his boy's football team, while a female reporter sneaks in to write an expose on harems.  There is also a running gag with the father's obsession with toy trains.

We see one shot of an F-86 being towed across the tarmac.  As the pilot prepares for flight, he stands before an RF-84F painted half black to look like a U-2, which is seen in flight in correct form as a model.  See this for the comedy instead.",1495670400,,658,4.300813008130081
8177437,5,B000NDI4X4,Saw this in 1963 when we were in libya. Rolled in the isles. It only played one nigit. I think i read that the us football team sued someone over this.,1484784000,,151,3.903225806451613
8177438,3,B000NDI4X4,Very politically incorrect hit and miss comedy with more hits than misses. JGPCH is a guilty pleasure of mine. Ustinov steals the show but I found MacLaine very annoying a good good chunk of the time.,1472601600,,200,4.583333333333333
8177439,4,B000NDI4X4,"Silly 60's comedy from what I call the Playboy-era.  Shirley MacLaine plays a reporter that smuggles herself into a harem in some Arabian country named Fawzia to do a story on it.  She ends up stranded there and is in danger of her virtue being compromised by the giddy, lecherous sheik, played by Peter Ustinov.  Her only hope is an equally stranded U2 pilot, played by Richard Crenna, who accidentally crash-lands in Fawzia when on a mission to spy on the Russians.  No wonder he's called Wrong Way Goldfarb.  The only way his bacon won't be fried is if he trains a football team for the sheik.  Seems His Majesty has a beef with the Notre Dame team and wants to beat them in a game.  So Wrong Way and the reporter end up faking a romance to stall off the sheik and keep Goldfarb's bad sense of direction a secret.  Film has a pair of beautiful, actual belly dancers, pretty girls, and amusing hi-jinks and lo-jinks.  MacLaine is pretty and has a beautiful body with absolutely no flab.  Crenna is at his most amiable and handsome.  Ustinov is amusing.  The film may be somewhat offensive to actual Arabians and to modern-day women, but it is a product of its time.  It is not great film-making but it is an enjoyable time-passer.  WHEN is a re-mastered USA DVD or DVD-R going to be released.  Soon, please.",1455494400,,1309,4.487288135593221
8177440,3,B000NDI4X4,"As I've said with other films made during this time period, everything was fair game to spoof and make fun of by highlighting a lot of the stereotypes and this time its about the Middle East.  Its a great film during its time but, in this current day and age its a must miss because of all the antics made by Ustinov as he goes through the stereotypes of being an oil rich Arab King.",1431475200,,383,4.1066666666666665

8177442,5,B000NDI4X4,"I just came across this film on cable, and felt absolutely COMPELLED to write this review. Firstly, and somewhat in self-defense of my reputation, I will say that I watched this movie because the screenplay was written by William Peter Blatty. (Yes, THAT William Peter Blatty.)

As you might already have read from other reviews here, John Goldfarb Please Come Home offends on every level you can imagine. As a comedy, it makes a dying vaudeville look elegant. Politically, this movie could possibly start a war if it was produced today. Women are offended. Those with some bazaar, indescribable mental disabilities are skewered. Religion and foreign cultures are decimated. All of this in the name of a comedy that never really delivers much of, well.... comedy.

Because I am a person of a certain age, I am familiar with movies that are frequently viewed as offensive from a modern viewpoint. They just do not stand the test of time. Therefore, I decided to research some original reviews, but stopped with what the New York Times revealed. As can be expected, they were offended by the stupidity, however, their review was equally offensive. When evaluating Shirley MacLaine's performance, they actually stated that ""...she dares expose a knobby frame in the company of a bevy of females who put her painfully in the shade."" Really? That was what bothered them?

It is also of note that the venerable Notre Dame actually secured an injunction against the release of John Goldfarb Please Come Home in theatres because it supposedly damaged the reputation of the football team. No surprise, the injunction was soon removed and now this film is free to be loosed on a society which is, thankfully, free to make its own decisions about such matters of utmost importance.

I highly recommend this movie so that you have the opportunity to make your own decisions. Incidentally, I thought Shirley MacLaine looked pretty darn good. But then, what do I know, since I'm only a woman.

Definitely see this comic book of a film, and remember you are free to think that it totally stinks (or not!)",1404691200,2,2089,4.889830508474576
8177443,1,B000NDI4X4,This movie is one of the dumbest and worst movies ever made. How anyone could find anything remotely funny about this movie baffles me. It is incredible in its awfulness. too much attention was paid to sets and not enough to plot or decent acting. Ustinov's character is embarrassing with the strange faces he keeps pulling that are meant to be funny. I do NOT recommend this movie to anybody who is looking for decent entertainment.,1393718400,,433,4.7105263157894735
8177444,1,B000NDI4X4,"This has been showing on cable recently. I would only buy this as a cut-out or bargain bin $2 dvd. It's not that is is politically incorrect and dated. It's just a tour de force crap fest with big names playing it straight. Ustinov particularly made me cringe. How could he?? All leering grunts and babbling supposedly arabic-sounding jibberish.  A variation of the sexy super spy films with somewhat creative sight-gags here and there and a mod-palace don't make up for it's earnest un-funny idiocy. Geez, it would have worked much better if it was possible to have be another one of the Hope-Crosby [-Hope as the 'sheik'] vehicles as done years before this was made. That's how low this one goes. This is a curiosity.",1391904000,,719,4.7063492063492065
