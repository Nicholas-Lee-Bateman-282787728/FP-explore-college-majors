8589623,1,B00004TS03,Picture and sound un-professional. It is more like a camcorder rendition. Have been to Tahiti 6 times and love Tahtian dancing and music. Have seen great vidoes of such and hoped this was one of them. I am sorely  disapointed. The 5 star review was misleading,963273600,4,259,4.630434782608695
8589624,5,B00004TS03,"This video captures the energy and electricity of a Tahitian dance competition, lots of color, pulsing drumbeats, gorgeous dancers.  I'd recommend it for anyone who has an interest in Polynesia or ethnic dance.",960336000,2,210,5.363636363636363
