4123491,5,B003GWTQ54,"PATTY DUKE ASTIN leads an awesome cast in this high-wire suspense
thriller from the master of disaster himself,IRWIN ALLEN(THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE,THE TOWERING INFERNO)! A cable car turns into
a perilous death trap after an electrical storm stalls it 7,000
feet in the air! Buffeted by winds that hamper their rescue,8 suspended passengers face a night of ultimate terror dangling
helplessly while the tram's weakened cable slowly starts snapping,one thin wire at a time,threatening to plunge the
passengers into the ravine below! Unlike most of the uninspired trash that Hollywood keeps feeding to the masses these days,
HANGING BY A THREAD at least has a lot of heart and soul that
went into the production,while it was made. I actually really
cared about whether or not this all-star cast was going to
make it,and since it was produced by IRWIN ALLEN himself,the
production values are TOP NOTCH! It's a crying shame that they just don't make movies like this anymore for either the big
screen or television. Movies that you know will keep you on
the edge of your seat with nail-biting suspense,as this one
did,without all of the profanity and sex that has sadly come to
dominate Hollywood over the past several decades. This is a disaster movie that contains a great story with traditional
family values that are so lacking from today's films. The all-
star cast consists of: SAM GROOM,PATTY DUKE ASTIN,JOYCE BULIFANT,
LONNY CHAPMAN,OLIVER CLARK,BERT CONVY,BURR DEBENNING,PETER DONAT,
PAUL FIX,DEANNA LUND,DONNA MILLS,CAMERON MITCHELL,ROGER PERRY,
and MICHAEL SHARRETT.",1315612800,7,1571,5.288

Somewhat slow and predictable.
Always has a cop or 2, criminal or 2, affair or 2, a kid or 2, and an injury or 2.
Could use more action and less talk.",1475712000,,171,3.914285714285714

I thought it was very good on tv a long time ago when I watched it for the very first time as a teenager, however now that it is on dvd, it is 100% better. For all you disaster film movie goers out there, take my word for it, buy this movie. I promise, you will not be disappointed. It kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire film. This movie is not boring. It is 100% movie action through and through. Trust me!!!",1348012800,,447,3.923076923076923
8396609,4,B003GWTQ54,"I am a Sam Groom fan and an Irwin Allen  fan so I bought this. It is  good film, lots of back story and good acting.  It gets a litle slow in the middle, but picks up.  It is about a group of friends who take the cable car up from Palm Springs to the top of the mountian for a private party.  The owner of the cable car is one of the friends.  Lightning strikes the wheels and melts  the wheels to the cable.  As they  hang there, the cable slowly startes to snap.  During this there are flashbacks that shows their life as friends and it all plays out like an episode of Knott's Landing.  I live pretty close to where this was filmed.  I went up on this cable car once.  It was not fun.  It is frightening enough without having to worry about it breaking.",1326672000,,756,3.9865771812080535
