2325652,4,B0009VNYOY,"I usually work out to a overall body exercise dvd but I always pick up this one when I'm not in the mood to exercise, I'm too tired to even get started, or just feeling guilty in general.  This does the job.  Mari can be somewhat annoying and this dvd is rather boring.  However, this brief, intensive workout really does hit the buns and thighs.  It may feel like you're not working out but the next day tells the true story.  I will always keep this on hand.",1179792000,,460,4.181818181818182
2325653,5,B0009VNYOY,"I do this workout once a week, and with over 100 fitness videos I own that makes it one of the most used.  It's only 19 minutes long, not too terribly tough but I feel it working.  I have only tried a few Winsor Pilates videos but this one I like the most by far.

Mari Winsor leads you through this workout and is joined by some of her instructors from her Hollywood studio.  She starts with the side kick series, which includes front/back kicks, bicycle, leg lifts, big and small circles, and hot potato.  Then she will move into some inner thigh work with inner thigh lifts, then you lift both legs up later lowering the bottom leg up and down, then you finish off with scissors.

The next segment is called Fetal Thighs.  You start with your legs in a fetal position and do leg lifts, then you will do more leg lifts but with the knee pointed downward, this is followed by clams, elevated clams, and yet more elevated clams but adding a leg lift.  The entire side kick and fetal thigh series is repeated on the other side before you finish out with leg beats and a final stretch.

I like this routine, it is short and to the point. There are times that I need a short pilates on those time crunches days, this fits the bill.  If you had to pick one Winsor Pilates video, this is the best one in my opinion.  Highly recommended.",1163980800,21,1331,4.2629482071713145
2325654,5,B0009VNYOY,"This was my introduction to Pilates and man did it burn the first few times I did it. It got better the more often I did it. I still come back to this tape whenever I want a good Pilates work out. One of the other reviewers didn't think there were enough reps done. The fetal thighs have more than enough reps and I am always happy to get to the end. More reps would kill me.

This work out got me into a smaller size and I was very happy for that.",1161907200,8,448,3.817204301075269
2325655,4,B0009VNYOY,"Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the Winsor series.

I enjoy doing this 20 minute video that is just for bun and thighs.  Although she doesn't do enough reps for certain excercises, the ""fetal thigh"" section is really good.  I do feel the burn at the end, but am not overly tired.  I would definitely recommend.",1152921600,2,314,4.553571428571429
2325656,3,B0009VNYOY,"I am not a fan of the entire Winsor series because Mari tries to cram in too many positions without doing enough reps. You are only just starting to feel the muscle work and she is moving on to the next position.

The moves are good, but I need to pause the dvd and keep going until I start feeling the burn for it to be any good.  Perhaps if you are a real beginner with little or no muscle condition it may work - I am only intermediate and it is way too brief for me.  Mari should have split the work out into 2 parts to reduce the number of exercises and increase the reps.

All this being said, this is the best of her dvds.  If you are after good pilates try Denise Austins 'hit the spot pilates' or if you want true pilates by a genuine expert try Rael pilates 17 and 27 - far superior to Winsor.  He performs the movements slowly and perfectly with enough reps so you are working your muscles and not quickly flying through the program to fit as many positions into the workout as possible.",1150416000,47,998,4.092307692307692
2325657,5,B0009VNYOY,"I have done this video 4-5 times a week for 3-4 years.  It is short enough to do often, but, I think very efficient and effective.  Marie's cueing is good with just enough talking and enthusiasm. Sometimes, I add resistance bands or balls to increase the effectiveness.  It definately has made a diiference in the tone of my hips and thighs.",1147305600,14,341,4.557377049180328
2325658,5,B0009VNYOY,"I felt the burn after doing the workout. I like the fetal position best, i felt my buns burn. I can not fit into my prepregnancy jeans. the video is short approx 20mins. The setup of the video is a bit boring, but the results compensate for it.",1124323200,6,244,4.104166666666667
2325659,5,B0009VNYOY,"The first time I did this video, I didn't feel anything.  But, as time progressed and I did the video more often, I began to feel the deep burning in the muscles around my hips and seat.  I suppose, as with all exercises, attention and awareness to form and alignment plays a huge factor - this totally applies to this video.  The video is not very long so very easy to complete - before you know it, the session will be over.  I do believe that with proper form and with consistent use, you will see a difference.  Another positive aspect about this video is that it is totally low impact.  This is good for me as I have problems with my knees.

Mari Winsor is an engaging and warm host - without being overbearing.  I don't feel she is fake with her words of encouragement - overall, a good guide with appropriate cueing.

I normally keep very active - participating in both kickboxing and ashtanga yoga almost daily.  I normally work out at least 2 hours a day.  I am female and in my late 20s.  Unfortunately I am in a new town and a bit short on funds so am relying on dvds to remain active.

I purchased this DVD as part of a set with ABS sculpting.  A much better deal than to purchase individually.",1121904000,14,1206,4.232456140350878
2325660,5,B0009VNYOY,I love this DVD.  In 21 minutes you get a power-packed workout that really delivers.  Mari's exercises work!  Muscles buried deep in the hip and buttocks that I'd never felt before burned.  Each time I do this I feel stronger and more flexible.  I've lost 1 inch in my hips so far. . .,1121904000,14,285,4.203703703703703
2325663,5,B0009VNYOY,"Mari Windsor is my favorite form of exercise. I danced ballet for 11 years, so my body responds well to these types of exercises. Her sequences are well thought out and you can feel the difference after the first week or 2.",1471996800,2,223,4.333333333333333

2325687,4,B0009VNYOY,The only thing I can say negative about it is that I wish it was longer.  She has another lower body pilates DVD which is basically the same thing.  Wish there was some way that I could have reviewed it before purchasing it.,1432425600,2,224,4.186046511627907

2325694,5,B0009VNYOY,"I bought this dvd many yrs ago but never really committed to doing it regularly until earlier this yr. This is a sculpting and shaping workout so if you are looking to make your butt or thighs bigger, this dvd won't do that. It sculpts what's already there. If your butt is flat, it will round it out some. If your butt is oversized, sags, shapeless then you will love this dvd. I saw results the 2nd week doing it 3 times a week. It lifts the bottom part of your butt and makes it more round. It will make your thighs tighter and leaner. My whole life I had a problem with my thighs bulking when I would do squats and lunges. This workout sculpts without bulking. It gets rid of saddlebags too. I fell off the wagon with my pilates routine but am recommitting myself today to do the workout 3 times a week. My goal is to go from a size 8/10 to a 4/6. I'll try to report back in 3 mos my progress.

2325704,5,B0009VNYOY,"I have had a problem with big thighs my entire life. No matter how much weight I have lost, my thighs were never as slim as I wanted. I have tried every home DVD you can think of over the years with no success. I have been doing the Mari Winsor Bun & Thigh DVD 2-3 times a week for about a year and a half and it still hurts EVERY time. I mean that as a compliment. Whereas before it was all I could do just to make it through, now I can focus and adjust to get the best burn possible. I remember the exact moment I was on my daily walk and realized that my thighs weren't touching! AND, for the first time in my life I can stand feet together and see light between my thighs.

2325727,5,B0009VNYOY,"I started this workout in 2002 via VHS, and I have stuck with it all these years.  It works, and it only takes 20 minutes of my time.  It is easy on the back and produces great results.  HOWEVER when my VHS player refused to work, I purchased the NEW DVD through Amazon twice from two different vendors.  Unfortunately, both discs had a manufacturing defect.  Both of the discs played for 39 seconds into the workout and then reverted back to the main menu.  It is impossible to fast forward past the 39 second mark.  At first I thought that the problem might be my DVD player, so I tried it on 4 different players with the same results.  I returned the disc to Amazon with no hassle and purchased again from a different vendor.  I got the exact same results with the new disc.  I am so disappointed.

I've lost an inch on each thigh, an inch around my hips, and an inch around my butt. Four inches in two weeks. It's not as much as a lot of these workout videos claim you can lose, but it's real and it's awesome. My butt is HIGHER than it was before. Not that much higher, but I can see it when I compare my before pictures to my current pictures. For two weeks, I think these results are fantastic.

The workout itself is very easy. I had done pilates maybe twice before trying this DVD, and I found all the moves to be completely doable. I didn't have to rest or take a break during it at all. It's only like nine minutes on each side, but you will be BURNING by the end. It's a struggle to keep going, especially during the end, but Mari is super encouraging and really makes you want to keep going. I'm two weeks in and I still have trouble keeping my form (not moving my torso, remembering to hold my stomach in, not moving my hips) but I can tell I'm getting better each time.

My butt is always a bit sore after the workout, but not too bad. Mostly just uncomfortable, not painful. The next day I'm never really sore.

I love Mari. I don't like how she doesn't do the moves with you, but she does have five of her instructors doing the moves. She is really encouraging and easy to understand. After eight times of this video, I'm still not sick of her. Her little reminders to hold in your stomach are always needed (for me at least).

I cannot rave about this video enough. I just love it so much. It's really fun and I actually look forward to doing it. I have two of her other DVDs and I like this one the best.",1322438400,14,1731,4.08235294117647
2325807,5,B0009VNYOY,"I have been doing this DVD almost every day for 3 weeks.  And I can see results.  My pants are much loser and I have measured the results.

I had been walking 3 miles and cutting back but I had to cut back on my walking to 1.5 miles day due to time constraints.  Anyhow, this is working as far as reducing inches in my thighs and buns far better than just walking alone.

The tape is getting easier to do and I as that happens I try to improve my form.  At first, I have to admit the burn was so bad I could not focus on the form as much and just tried to get through the routine.

Stay with it and focus on form and you will see results. I love this tape.",1313107200,5,656,3.7794117647058822

2325811,5,B0009VNYOY,"I bought the Windsor series in 2002.  I don't remember how much I paid, but it wasn't that much.  I started using it (buns and thighs) right away because that's where my fat and cellulite decided to live.  My genetic makeup made me a pear shape so I had to do something about it.  Clothes never fit right.  I would take a 10-12 top and a 12-14 bottom so I would be loose at the top and tight at the bottom!  Well,  after starting buns and thighs, what a difference!  And Mari's right, takes only 3 times a week at, what, 20 minute workout?  Now, I'm fortunate because I bought this when it was produced by Guthry-R..... and now there's a different producer.  When I bought it, there was a set of 4 discs in the box...one for each part of the body.  I gave the other discs away because I wanted to concentrate on my issue points.

It doesn't matter how old or young you are.  Just do it, and really do it, don't play around with the exercises.  Give it your best shot.  Mari doesn't talk too much and gives just the right information.  Now FYI, I'm almost 65, have been sitting around feeling sorry for myself after knee joint replacements,and always was afraid to start exercising again.  I thought exercising would make my knees worse, but this program, along with stationary biking, made me feel so much better in only one day!  And my knees don't bother me as much as before.  For those of you who don't know how the knee works, it's the muscles and ligaments that make the knee stronger and the only way to do that is to exercise.  I have finally got out of my ""victim"" role and faced my ow demons and decided to finally do this for myself.

I do believe the price is exhorbitant but worth it if you use it and are fully committed to doing the exercises as presented and at least 3 times a week.  It takes a small amount of time.  Since I bought the set around 2002, I couldn't find it in my home although I searched everything twice.  On the third try, I found it!  And used it that day.  I feel steadier and not as wobbly, after only one day,plus some stationary bike riding, but no more than 10-15 min. a day right now.  My self esteem has risen dramatically and I'm on the road to getting off these 50 lbs. I gained since my knee operations.  Ladies, and men too, these exercises WORK but only if you do them and are committed to them.  My saddlebags are diminishing as is my cellulite.  Now I believe I can get into a bathing suit this summer and enjoy the water instead of covering up and being ashamed of my body.  While there are those who can't do anything about their bodies, if you can do something, anything, especially something like this, you will be giving yourself a wonderful gift of fitting into clothes you always wished you could wear, or put on something right off the rack and have it fit perfectly because your ""bottom"" will, in time, and not that much time, match your ""bottom.""  Get it, and do it, if your buns and thighs are your problem areas.  We are supposed to accept ourselves as we are, but if I did that and continued my unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle I would be a pretty big gal.  At this age, it's definitely time to stop those unhealthy habits (and at any age) and love myself and be the best I can be and stop feeling sorry for myself because I ""can't wear what other people wear.""  Get it, DO it, it Works!",1299628800,26,3356,4.264659270998415

2325838,2,B0009VNYOY,"I checked this out from the library 4-6 weeks before a beach vacation to get some toning up.  I picked this one because of the high ratings users here have given the video, I recognized the brand and because it was a fairly short workout I could do often.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.  I have to say I didn't see any improvement at all, which is my main basis for using it and for my low score.  I also thought the video seemed a little dated (2002).  Mari is pleasant enough, I really felt comfortable with her instruction for the most part.  There were a few parts that were too quick for me to get in all of the reps.

For what it's worth, afterwards I started walking stairs, 15 flights, 2x a day during the workweek and I have gone down a pant size and kept it off for over 6 months.  I am not athletic and some days those stairs are slower and tougher than others, but I keep at it because I got results.  I'm in my 40s and I'm back to nearly my high school weight, plus I feel and look great.  My hubby has noticed the difference, too.  This literally takes only 10-15 minutes a day and the results are well worth it for me.

So I'm looking forward to seeing the results that will come from this one! The workout starts with the same 3 leg exercises done in 20 Minute Workout, but then progresses to inner thigh work and a series of leg lifts that will literally have you on the floor groaning and moaning. Mari takes you through these exercises quickly and efficiently. Although it's touted as 20 minutes, it feels more like 15. But those are 15 minutes well spent as you can feel that every one of these exercises is having an effect. Also, Mari knows just when to give you that little encouragement that keeps you going to do the last leg lift when you feel like screaming. That woman is some kind of (evil?) genius!
As a busy mom, I like the video because it's so quick, I can slip it in whenever I have an extra 15 minutes and know that I'm really doing something. Well worth the money!",1258502400,2,1032,4.380208333333333

I got this DVD several weeks ago, and I got the biggest kick when my 11 year old recently told me that my butt looks ""different.""  It does!  I saw results rather quickly.
