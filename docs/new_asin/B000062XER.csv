But I do highly recommend another film on crop circles, which isn't listed on amazon, it's called Crop Circles Quest for Truth, and it's playing in movie theatres here and there. I understand that a dvd is also out. That film is first rate! and done by an academy award nominee.
I'll give these guys at Multimedia 2000 3 stars for taking on the topic...",1038355200,5,434,4.37037037037037
7957950,3,B000062XER,"Everyone knows that crop circles are made by alien flatulence. Where's the footage of trumping extra-terrestrials? I paid good money for this, only to watch some beared Open University lecturer bleat on about mystical mind energy. Stuff and nonsense. Give me footage of a green skinned, boggle-eyed, hairless, stumpy monster emitting a fart of such power and resonance it changes pitch four times and knocks over 14 hectares of prime wheat any day.",1037923200,4,448,5.1506849315068495
7957951,3,B000062XER,"It says approx. 90 minutes on the cover but the total time is only 42 minutes. I felt cheated. I want half of my money back. I'm not going to buy any more DVD from Multimedia 2000.
Oh, about the video? Fascinating footages. Can't get enough of them.",1028419200,15,249,4.208333333333333
