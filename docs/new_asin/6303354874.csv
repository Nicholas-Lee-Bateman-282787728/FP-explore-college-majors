It reminds me of the early Audrey Hepburn romantic comedies with a french twist! It is magical, mythical and wonderfully fun. Don't miss it!",1346112000,,250,4.704545454545454

If you're in th mood for a little French whimsy you might want to take a look at the light-hearted comedy/romance, 'A La Mode' released in '94. This rather charming film tells the story of Fausto (Ken Higlin), a teenage orphan apprentced to a Jewish tailor. As Fausto learns the business he ultimately finds himself not only passionate about his new profession but also madly in love with the beautiful Tonie (Florence Darel), the daughter of a nearby auto mechanic. Will Fausto be successful in his dream of becoming a famous designer of woman's wear and win the heart of Tonie as well?

'A La Mode' is an enjoyable but not particularly memorable film. Many of my favorite moments take place in the tailor's shop during conversations between Fausto and his mentor Mietek (Jean Yanne). Mietek's dialogue is clever, crisp and meaningful. He delivers the best performance in the film, adding substance and depth to an otherwise shallow storyline. Then of course there's the lovely Florence Darelto whos' smile is enough to cause any male heart to flutter. Her presence alone make the film worth at least one viewing.",1181260800,,1152,4.93298969072165
7844797,4,6303354874,"This film is quite the charmer, as are all the characters and the French je ne sais quoi spirit as well. Set in the late 60's, but not focussed on the political ferment of the times, it starts off in a very Dickensian mood, but very quickly evolves into a delighful look into a particular quartier, where Jewish tradesmen take on apprentices (in this case two non-Jewish orphans) and the plot, such as it is, revolves around their growing affection for each other and the surrounding community as the two orphan friends find their metiers and manhood.

Meanwhile the soundtrack is reminiscent of 8 1/2, with a certain circus atmosphere which permeates the film. It is a kind of pleasant supperealistic fantastic story that is peculiarly French and if you let yourself follow its well-defined universe, you are in for a treat.",1172275200,,825,4.809859154929577
7844798,2,6303354874,"This film will not make the list of 100 best films ever, nor the top 200 or 300, but the film does make a decent effort to make you laugh.  Overall, it is a decent film without any break through performances.  The movie is the story of Fausto, an orphan who becomes an apprentice to an established tailor.  Fausto, however, has dreams of becoming a fashion designer, particulary for women.  Fausto's friend in the film provides much of comical relief, and is the only character who seems to have any depth.
If you have a couple of hours to waste and need a good laugh, then you may want to watch this film.  If you are looking for a good foriegn or french film however, I do not recommend you rent/buy this film.",973468800,3,712,4.323308270676692
