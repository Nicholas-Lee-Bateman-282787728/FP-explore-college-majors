1828749,5,B000086K3E,"If you read -- and believe --  what ""jrmcgrail"" wrote about this video (below), you will lose a wonderful opportunity to go on one of the most incredible science-based journeys on the planet that clearly, succinctly and simply shows us the origin of the human race. This video is a must-have for anyone who has ever asked the question, ""where did we come from."" The joy, beyond the enlightening science facts, is taking the journey with Dr. Wells to the far reaches of the earth, to meet and talk with the human beings whose genes gave birth to ours; to every race on the planet. It's a great exploration into our origins, and shows us that we are all one big family after all. Kudos to Dr. Wells for getting this project completed and for this captivating and well-done story.",1086480000,49,777,4.55
1828750,4,B000086K3E,"This documentary follows a scientist Spenser Wells who has done in-depth study and observation of the human genome and markers in DNA.  Wells takes you through this journey with remarkable storytelling that lets you imagine everything that could of happened.  He takes you on the journey he believes these bushman, out ancestors took that eventually lead them to inhabiting the world and adapting to make the different cultures.
You see the tribe that is the closest decedents to the bushman tribe that left Africa in search of something new; you even get to see the closest relative to one of these bushman.  Wells also makes good use of examples, charts and diagrams when he can to try to explain and show how genetic markers move down the line in ancestry.
Although the in the end you are left with some unanswered questions and wondering how Wells even started this, but you have a lot to think about.  In the end this a great learning tool and gives a new perspective of what you are taught in school and how man came to inhabit six out of seven continents.",1084752000,3,1062,4.632978723404255
1828751,4,B000086K3E,"Spenser Wells' two-hour video surveys his genetic research in tracing the spread of Homo sapiens out of Africa and across the planet. His compelling presentation outlines his findings, but leaves you with more unanswered questions than you begin with. To his credit, he points out this quandary at the beginning of the film.
Wells begins in southern Africa where he combines personal interviews in the filed with laboratory results to identify genetic markers in the human genome. Step by step, he employs this technique to examine modern Homo sapiens in southern Africa and tracks two waves of emigration, one to Australia and another across the rest of the planet. He dates the beginning of the first wave TO about 50,000 years ago and the second about 10,000 years LATER.
While the information he provides is well documented, Wells does not explain his scientific basis for dating genetic markers or genetic drift in Y chromosomes passed along from father to son over the past 2000 generations since (he says) our ancestors first departed Africa. Neither does he discuss broader findings that positively justify his selection of the key individuals in India and central Asia. Most of this is probably due to time constraints imposed on a two-hour video. In addition, he offers no comments on possible alternative views or dating methods to explain the spread of humans around the planet.
What he does do is summarize his personal investigations, laying down a pattern and beginning anew the dialogue about when, where, and how our ancestors dispersed from southern Africa. His presentation brings together scholarly insight, outstanding field investigation, and superior story-telling skills. Wells presents his viewers with dramatic new contributions to the ongoing investigation of the origins of modern humans that  merit inclusion in any serious study of these questions.",1083110400,7,1878,5.280936454849498

1828780,5,B000086K3E,"This documentary is still as relevant as this mornings news: the concept of race is made up. Homo sapiens is one young species of recent haplogroups and cultures which do not follow lines of identity or politics. And Dr. Spencer Wells was one of the first to point it out. His research of human DNA tells us authoritatively how just a few family groups of early modern humans in Africa became nearly the entire human population we know today. Moreover, that discovery is pretext to an even more powerful message: that racial distinctions, as modern people think of them, are scientifically meaningless.

That's huge. Huge. It's no surprise that Wells, clearly more at home in the laboratory, literally crossed the earth to check his work and proclaim his results as interestingly as he knew how. As a biologist he is more than up to the task. Wells explains the conceptual essence of his DNA research with impressive clarity, and none too soon: the genetic footprints he followed across the world took 50,000 years to put down, but are likely to vanish within the next century. Wells has conclusively documented a core testament to human history, one which happened so unconsciously that we might have otherwise lost that part of our shared story forever.

That's the main reason this documentary is so valuable. But there's another dimension that makes Journey of Man interesting. Wells chooses a very curious route in retracing the human journey, dedicating a significant proportion of his on-screen time to visiting indigenous people in each of the major way-points flagged by his research. At each stop he tries to explain his work to his native hosts, seemingly out of the blue - dropping by as one would for a cup of coffee, and then launching into a simplified, at times translated, academic-quality lecture on DNA research, genetics, human lineage, and what Wells' conclusions should mean to those people.

Now I've enjoyed this documentary at least a half dozen times and it is still a mystery why Wells chooses his audiences and his means of delivery. Native peoples' reactions, as Wells himself acknowledges, range from polite boredom to visible confusion, anger, even fear. In one instance Wells asks an Australian Aboriginal tribal descendant if there is any traditional narrative to support the conclusion that his ancestors migrated to the Australian continent from elsewhere, some forty-plus thousand years ago. His Aboriginal interviewee is furious; Wells notes good-naturedly, ""He really lets me have it."" The man explains that his people's traditions say that they originated on the same lands they call home now. ""Why isn't it possible that we branched out from here?"" he insists.

Wells admits that that visit did not go well, without explaining what exactly he was trying to accomplish. Wells later meets with a group of Navajo elders, shows them a photo album of all the people he's visited, and proceeds to tell his Native American hosts that their people originated from several other continents. Scientifically, of course, that's what the evidence shows. But the Navajo are nonplussed by this lecture, and they do not hide their offense. As one elder explains, their traditional origin narratives tell the Navajo they emerged from the earth, just as a child emerges from her mother. Wells still doesn't spot what he's done. He dismisses the Navajo out of hand, explaining that he requires evidence before he will believe any particular story, and then redirects his Native hosts to the photo album of his travels.

For whatever reason Wells chose to include these cringe-inducing interactions in his documentary, Journey of Man is actually richer for it. Wells never puts his finger on the point, but one of the most important lessons revealed by all of this is that, just as science helps tell the human species -what- we are, our cultures tell us -who- we are. And, even as understandably excited as Wells is about his life's work, it is the second question that has occupied the bulk of human contemplation since our earliest days. Wells inadvertently reinforces this point every step of the way. He is no less a product of his own culture and history than are the indigenous peoples he visits: he is so enthralled with his contribution to truth that he blunders right into the stereotype of the Western missionary obsessed with converting the Natives.

Wells' laboratory-evangelical fervor begs a question: If the scientific truth of racial irrelevance and the close relatedness of all modern humans is so important - and to be clear, it absolutely is - why wasn't Wells taking that message first to people in dominant cultures who don't get it? After all, there are so many groups who abuse culture, myth and racial misconceptions with tragic results today. But Wells doesn't challenge contemporary nonscientific European and Eurasian identity myths. In one chilling interaction in Kyrgyzstan a man thanks Wells for coming across the world to inform him that ""my blood is pure."" Wells seems unfazed, he doesn't even attempt to clarify what that meant.

So it's strange, at first, that Wells only confronts the nonscientific origin traditions of indigenous peoples who have been struggling for centuries against the pressures of eradication and assimilation - whose origin stories are therefore positive sources of strength and identity. After all, cultural and political sensitivity are not incompatible with good science (see Dr. Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" documentary series).

But it is worth noting that Wells also does little to hide these apparent shortcomings in Journey of Man. True, he may not be altogether aware of them. But the awkwardness and asymmetry of Wells' interviews with indigenous peoples are conspicuous, and Wells could have easily smoothed over all of that in the editing room. He did not. ""Journey of Man"" is clearly intended as a double-entendre - not only what the journey of humankind reveals about us as a species today, but also what Dr. Wells' personal journey on the DVD reveals about us all. Journey of Man places the scientific reality of our human origins on equal display with the cultural reality of our need to find meaning in that story. Risks arise when one meaning-making effort collides with others, as they have throughout human history and as they do in this documentary. Wells left all of that in, perhaps as a reminder of how important it is that we now have a science for the natural equality of humans, even if human equality does not always come naturally.",1482969600,6,6550,5.030414746543779

1828831,4,B000086K3E,"Based on the book sharing the same title, National Geographic financed this fascinating documentary hosted by the charismatic and enthusiastic geneticist Dr. Spencer Wells.

This work was the basis for the huge Genographic Project (launched on 2005) financed by the National Geographic Society and IBM and lead by Dr. Wells.

Like a detective looking for particles of evidence, Wells sends the viewer on a beautiful journey through time and space. Backtracking markers in the Y chromosome we can theoretically have a very good idea of the long voyage of migration that sent our ancestors to spread all around the world.

His theory of the first voyage to Australia is quite solid, as is the central Asian destination as the way point that separated small groups in different directions.

Wells also tries to explain the motivators and enablers that allowed that epic endeavor; the answer to both questions was...the ice age; although he also explores several anthropological achievements like art and language as enablers that increased the chances of survival of humankind.

There are small questions that the author, being a geneticist, should have included in this documentary. As an example I can mention the fact that most Europeans have a very small percentage (but impossible to ignore) of Homo Neandartalensis DNA. That might have stirred the clear streamlined idea the author wants to clarify. It would raise other hypotheses, variables. But this documentary is quite big, it could have less fillers and more scientific data, or even other theories (even if only for the author stating why he didn't agreed with them).

In conclusion, this is a very worthy work, which might be eye opening for many.  It's impressive that we are all descended from such a small group of individuals...we are all truly brothers and sisters.",1391644800,,1831,5.1447811447811445

This journey of a film is one that I urge all persons of all cultures to see.  You'll not only learn a bit about the science of genetic coding but you'll also come face to face with remnants of mankind's true pioneers. I learned that by using genetic dna mapping we really can chart a road map showing the migration of early man. And the proof is staring us right in the face if we look hard enough.

1828855,4,B000086K3E,"This is a beautiful video, with breathtaking landscape and a good flow of narrative. It was also very eye-opening in terms of the theories of how human migration may have occurred in pre-historic times. I've always wondered how humans existed in Africa, Eurasia and the Americas long before ship-building could be perfected. Eurasia and Africa not so much, but the Americas just seemed too far away. I admit to never really looking this up; it was just idle wonder about how people could have accomplished more than 10,000 years ago the same kind of things that Columbus and Vasco Da Gama were considered heroes for repeating barely 600 years ago. This video was priceless to me in just being able to provide theories that address these questions better than my imagination of a bunch of enterprising pre-historic humans that built an enormous raft and just floated themselves across the Atlantic.

The video also ends on a very important contemporary note, which addressed a lot of the puzzlement I felt about the simplistic presentation throughout. This video aims to reach the widest audiences possible, and for that, a lot of emotional and personal content seems to have been included. Far more than I'm comfortable with, but understandably so. I would probably have rated it at 3 stars if not for that closing note that sort of justified the travelogue-like presentation for a supposedly scientific discovery narrative.

1828865,3,B000086K3E,"I've just seen this video on Maryland Public Television. It's very good.

However, I have reservations about the certainty with which Dr. Wells approaches his subject, and most particularly the sermonizing at the end about how ""we are all one."" This is Barack Obama territory; Scientists should stick to science, IMHO.

Leslie Marmon Silko, in her book, ""The Almanac of The Dead,"" strongly objects to the western scientific view that all Native Americans came from a few hardy souls who crossed the Bering Sea during the last ice age. So, apparently, do the Navajo, who politely told Dr. Wells in the video that their founding myth says they emerged from the earth right there in Arizona. In the video, Dr. Wells blithely dismisses their myth as unscientific, and therefore not worth considering. He offered photos to prove it. To me, this revealing episode smacked of nothing less than the same old white man's imperialism, in its self-evident superiority sweeping away all resistance before it.

It may well be that Dr. Wells' and his colleagues' theory about the origin and then spread of mankind is dead on and therefore the case is closed. Based on 3,000 or so blood samples from 2 billion potential donors, and assuming 100% accuracy of the lab results (hope the FBI's lab wasn't involved!). Talk about bold! Nevertheless, I would be willing to bet the ranch that in 50 years this DNA-based theory will have been superceded--or perhaps complemented is a better word--by other discoveries and that Dr. Wells' will not be the accepted scientific wisdom. After all, that's how science works--someone posits a theory, and offers proof, and that theory lasts until someone comes along with another one, and so on.  I would have been happier if in the video (the book may be more nuanced) Dr. Wells had admitted that he was offering a theory only, not the definitive view of human life's origins.

One of the least credible portions of the video was the effort of the scientific lady who struggled to explain how northern Europeans gained their appearance (in a mere geologic blink)--as fair skinned and ended up looking like--well, like Dr. Wells. In sum, I thank Dr. Wells for his efforts, which were not small, but color me skeptical about swallowing whole the story he put together.",1203724800,15,2286,4.9119170984455955
1828866,3,B000086K3E,"Anthropologically speaking,the specie will create a CREATION STORY...it is one of the human(e) universals.  It is a part of the 'homebase' or village experience. Most people want to keep their Creation Story because it was made and envisioned by their own people, identifying their own ethnicity.  Therefore, if your Creation Story is forced upon them then it ends up being your view of the world forced on them when Nature has made the specie so that each population can create its own version of how life begins and how their people came forth to be in life.

I'm reminded of the woman, a 'Bushwoman' who was sitting in a classroom in South African and a European woman, a teacher, was teaching them religion, Christian religion.  But the Bushwoman got into trouble with the teacher because she would just look out of the window at the land for hours upon hours.  The teacher asked her why she was not listening and the woman explained that she had her own god and she had her own religion and she was not interested in learning anything about another god or another religion.  She wanted what was her people's for thousands of years and passed down through the ages to her from her ancestors.

That story was told to me decades ago by a young student of San ancestry whose family lived in the city and they had escaped from South Africa and came to America to save their lives. Her parents were obth medical doctors. The land was under European colonial rule in South Africa and The People of the Kalahari had been ""captured"" and taken from the desert; their way of life destroyed and they were forbid to go back. When Mandela was released from prison and became president, his government set the People of the Desert free and some of them returned; just some. Some stayed in modern life in the city but thousands and thousands were killed and they died due to diseases as a result of European invasion and colonization.

But Spencer Wells inferred (in this video) that their population spanning over 50,000 years in the desert was just dwingling from natural cause and effect, as if their way of life could not sustain further existence. I was looking at the San people wondering what they were thinking. And one of them said, ""Thank you for bringing us the information."" That's the reality now. That's what they have to do; they know what can still happen. So this news from Spencer was met with fear and a yarn. The People would say it if they thought they could, ""I don't need this information. It wasn't long ago that a theorist such as yourself came to us and told us we were subhuman.""

Yes. And before that, a theorist developed a thesis and called it: RACES OF PEOPLE..., eventually the idea and ideal was born that some people are inferior to modern people of European decent and thereby sub human.  Spencer said in the program that scientists will come up with ideas...for their careers.

Ideas. Some ideas are good, some ideas are bad. And, all science has an error rate and can be 'proven' wrong and changed.

The indigenous people: aboriginals and Hopi natives in America have a problem with Spencer's thesis,theory, and science. It didn't mean much to them that Spencer said they were among the oldest strands of human genetics and where they were in the line of development that Spencer describes. They defunct his theory and science and put forth their theory, worldview and belief: All people started with us and from us, kind of thing.  Now which one is true?

Bottomline and in an infinite sense: they're both right because both of their stories are Creation Stories, a human universals,which tells what life is, how life got to be, where life came from and what life is all about.  Humans will create their own creation story, which helps to form their own identity and ethnicity,as a People. It's a part of their 'soul'; this is who we are, this is how they know themselves, this is how they know they they came to be: anthropologically speaking.

When Spencer got to the European leg of his genetic story and journey he switched allegiance: 'We', to him, became European ancestry but later he did say he was an American citizen. So Spencer identifies his ancestry as European, as ""we"" but he can't understand why a Hopi-Native American wants to identify in the same way and that includes: creation story, history and world view: everything that makes him Hopi...or Australian aboriginal. [It is hard to give up the idea, ideal and vision that the feathers in my hat is far better than the feathers you have stuck in your hair...all humans are likely to adorn themselves with feathers, anthropologically speaking, if they can find them in their environment.]

I liked all the pictures of people from different places especially the people who lived in the artic circle but all of them.  They all looked like people with eyes, noses, ears and the rest: what goes on in their minds is different. The Indigenous People know how to live in environments for thousands and years and act as conservationists: other animal life live nearby or a bit away so in modern times we can know what life can shape and form because the humans they live with are conservationists.

I found it more to the point that Spencer drove a fancy jeep around and flew in a fancy plane and wore extraordinary clothing to face the elements but the true pioneering, adventuresome humans used their bare feet for thousands and thousands of miles.  They carried a stick, maybe a bow and arrow, and headed out to conquer the world as people.  Just as people; as a legacy to us; they spread the human genome to every environment on earth.  IN WHAT ORDER? We don't know that.  (Most of us don't even care about that.)  We probably will never, ever really know that for sure.  It appears that humans were not engineered to KNOW infinitively but they can have ideas and innovations and create technology.

Spencer's big Jeep was parked under the tree; he had his fashions on his body; he has his education and career ahead of him...; The People of the Kalihari don't wear clothes but they still had fashion and body adornments and tiny bows and arrows that they have used for hunting for 50,000 thousand years.

Isn't that saying something loud and clear to us--anthropologically speaking?

What we know, from academics, is a Western World creation story called 'Evolution' or the Evolutionary Theory and before that 'we'--Americans as Westerners, used a basic creation story called 'Genesis' in the Bible.  (That's why the two of them should be taught in schools together; they enhance the need for people to create a creation story; that behavior is a universal act among humans.)  OUR creation stories are just two stories among many just like the Native Americans said when they said they knew about creation stories.  The Hopi Native American man asked the ""teacher"", ""Why do our sacred stories have to be myths and yours have to be facts?""  Spencer responded with a definite, quiet force, ""Because we are scientists and require proof.  These are your relatives . . ."" he went on with his worldview jamming it into their native reality.  (I FOUND THIS MOST INTERESTING.)  I don't think native people have to be taught that other people are people just like them.  I think they have known that all along.  It has been Western thought in recent centuries that promoted and believed otherwise.)

And, why is this a ""Journey of Man""?  That's an erroneous title. This journey and population would not have gone very far if males went off alone without females. We do know that infinitively. The females were giving birth all the way...for Spencer's theory to be credible. So, travelling with pregnant females on foot in all kind of terrains-?-

I don't think this documentary was complimentary to Dr. Wells' craft and expertise.  I found it to be a regular market presentation but I never tire of the pictures of people from all over the world and I never tire of the earth's scenery (the little bits and pieces we did see).  I give it 3 stars for that.

1828867,5,B000086K3E,"While Dr. Wells' delivery in the documentary can be occasionally a bit hyperbolic to compensate for a wide audience, the material is fascinating.  The people he encounters along his journey are intelligent and articulate individuals, presented respectfully with varying opinions in regards to their own beliefs.  Dr. Wells' gradually becomes more comfortable with what he calls his ""blood speech,"" the explanation of his genetic research and his purpose for seeking those individuals specifically, and he is patient to give equal emphasis to their stories as well supporting his own.

What I truly respected about this video is that it doesn't beat the Creation vs. Evolution argument into the ground.  That isn't the point of the documentary.  What it does do is re-emphasize that no one ethnic group is superior over another, and that, regardless of skin color or ethnic background, we are all brothers and sisters.  With documentaries such as this one, and proper education, we can eradicate the false idea of ""race,"" and just start seeing family.

This documentary should be watched by everyone on this globe but it will surely enrage the entrenched racist who now has no logical leg to stand on in persisting to believe that skin-colour and ethnic background makes one superior to others.  These people have never let logic and science get in the way of their prejudices anyway and so even this brilliant dvd is probably not going to change much the ""thinking"" among those guys and yet it is still very heartening to know that science has now objectively proven that we are all truly one big family.

Just as no one race has a monopoly on intelligence, no one race has a monopoly on inventions and scientific discoveries as well.  What struck me is how inventive our ancestors were in adapting to their environment and to survive be it in the harsh conditions of the Arctic Tundra or the predator invested plains of Western Europe using simple tools and their brains to survive.  Subsequent generations were able to build upon the learnings of previous generations so that humans not only survived but thrived to quickly dominate the planet.

Europeans are not responsible for all the great discoveries of the world but benefitted from the previous learnings of other races too.  The Arabs invented algebra and gave us our alphabet script, the Indians invented many important concepts such as chess to the zero, the Chinese invented too many things to mention here and all these inventions/discoveries were borrowed and adapted to add to the collective knowledge of humankind.

Since we all come from a common ancestor and have evolved to suit our unique environments, we all developed unique tools to suit our situations.  To say one race is better than another is clearly wrong and erroneous.  I'm just glad that science has now proven this to be so.

His review in itself is flawed, since he lacks any understanding of the 99.9% rule. When geneticists say people are 99.9% alike, they are talking about INDIVIDUALS, not races. A black person and a white person could be more genetically alike than a white person and another white person. He is simply spewing rubbish. There are no real differences between people except the external, superficial ones. This documentary proves it. Spencer Wells travels around the world collecting DNA samples to test for the genetic marker that will reveal our ancestors' migratory patterns.

  Having said that, I want to point out that though the data being collected is great, the way it is being interpreted in this Program on this DVD is sheer feel-good politically correct nonsense. This video (and other reviewers) have stated that how we are similar is more important than how we are different genetically. This is simply not true -- in fact, it is the opposite. This becomes clear when you realize we share 98% of our genes with chimpanzees. That 2% difference which enables us to have religion and construct cathedrals, have a symbolic language and arts, plant crops, learn the secrets of the universe with science, cure diseases, and walk on the moon is pretty important -- I am sure EVERYONE will agree!

  I think we share on the order of 50% of our genes with even a banana plant... The DIFFERENCES are EVERYTHING! Races vary on many intellectual characteristics in regular patterns -- everything from abstract thinking and IQ, to crime and literacy rates. Moreover, the variations are the same in every culture across the globe you find these groups and the differences are stable.

  Beyond that, the record of science and civilization shows a stark contrast between races -- even when they exist in the same geographical areas together. 99.5% of all scientific advances and great works of art and music are from European people. There are almost no black physicists. (forget about those fake scientific black ""social engineering"" TV characters...). Crime rates can be predicted by racial makeups of all the major cities in the USA at a .8 correlation level. This cannot be due to racism when you consider all the evidence together. Haiti had an infrastructure, etc. and peace until the blacks / mixed killed and /or drove the French out. Now look at them. No science or much literacy there... In every case we find, whether left to themselves or among other races we see the same thing -- so ""prejudice"" is not the cause, it is the effect! We have it ALL backward! So does this DVD.

  These things are staring us right in the face, yet we want to cling to ideas that we are somehow all the same. That is dangerous to our future. I, for one, want Europeans to survive and not go extinct. They have a different destiny -- they are speciating into a miraculous path among all creatures on the Earth. This video would be great except for that. It is a backward interpretation. Tiny differences mean everything OBVIOUSLY. Over time, they mean the world.

  Other than that, I do recommend you watch this DVD -- it is very interesting.",1149033600,23,2866,4.636363636363637

1828882,5,B000086K3E,"I just finished watching the Journey of Man, and find myself inspired and moved almost to tears by this scientific validation of the inter-relatedness of all humanity.

Many people make a mistake when they take the stories told in the various scriptures and oral traditions of the world as literal descriptions of the cosmological beliefs of various peoples.

While I would not argue that many adherents of various religions take their myths of origns in a literal fashion, other adherents look more deeply under the surface to the message of the myth.

Take the creation accounts in Genesis, for example.  They differ from one another, but the base truth in both of them is that ""God"" is the source of all creation and all creation is good.  I put ""God"" in quotes because I understand that proper noun can mean different things to different people.

I find absoolutely no contradiction between my Christian faith and the science on which this video is based.

The charming narrator takes us on a journey 50,000 years into the human past to trace where our African ancestors came from and where they ended up.  The scientists involved in the project took blood samples from people all over the world in order to track certain d.n.a. ""markers"" on the Y chromosome that trace humankind's migration out of Africa to the rest of the world.  While this may sound a little dry, the producers of the dvd do an amazing job of not only explaining the genetic science clearly and entertainingly, but the narrator actually travels to many of the places that are important to our collective history and interviews the people that possess these genetic markers.  I think the most profound lesson I drew is how utterly meaningless on a genetic level is our conception of race.  Under the skin (and hair and eyes) we really are all the same.  The photography is beautiful so, combined with what you will learn about our extraordinary ancestors, this dvd is well worth your time.",1126310400,16,1097,4.717277486910994

This is the story of the Journey of Man (specifically the inheritance of the human Y-chromosome) starting from Africa and ending up in various remote parts of the world, including South America and Australia. This documentary answers how mankind began its journey and filled the globe.

Spencer Wells, the scientist who made these pioneering discoveries, travels to India, Australia, Europe, and America on a genetic trail and narrates the story with first-hand knowledge and experience of the subject.

This is a treat that comes once in a decade, and is certainly the most fruitful documentary I've ever seen. Don't miss it!",1121644800,15,855,5.462121212121212
1828886,3,B000086K3E,"Put on your most expensive hiking boots and settle in for this trek around the globe in which you will follow the sparse tracks of our ancestors found by geneticist Spencer Wells (and other scientists) on the genetic trail of human evolution.

Science is rarely so attractive. And most of us certainly aren't well off enough to sport a wardrobe of Northface gear and travel around the world. What is with PBS and these boyish well-groomed scientists with expertly styled hair? 50% of the film was watching Spencer walk around or close-ups of his mug, albeit it was not an entirely bad-looking one.

There is amazingly beautiful scenery in this film and it is interesting to see the small glimpses of the cultures of the native peoples of various lands in between shots of Spencers pensive profile. We visit our distant cousins the Bushmen, Chukti, Navajo, Frenchmen, Kazakhstanis, the descendents of the Dravidians, and the Aboriginies.

Another criticism of the film, other than the camera's obsession with Spencer, is that he states erroneously that only the Y-Chromosome can be used for such a study because only it is passed down from father to son. While it is true that only men have the Y chromosome, many anthropologists and their collaborating geneticists are using mitochondrial DNA, passed down from mother to daughter.

There is a lot of filler in this drawn-out film but it does showcase rarely-seen in difficult to reach areas of the world. It diagrams some of the hardships that early humans struggled through, and the many beautiful lands we've traversed in our collective genetic history. There may be more branches, perhaps we may even discover our family tree has a divergent trunk, but for now, Spencer has drawn the family ties closer in a film partly designed to bring us all together.",1121385600,34,1807,4.934210526315789
1828887,5,B000086K3E,"One is rightfully suspicious of bromides about how we are all ""one"" and that we are all brothers and sisters.  However, at least twice in my life I have witnessed something that justifies these notions:  one, the picture of the earth from the Apollo spaceship and, two, the documentary ""Journey of Man"".

The film-maker probably did not intend to make a sociological/political statement but the film certainly destroys racialist arguments about essential differences between human races.  We are all descendants of Africa and, it would seem, all distant cousins of one another, even if that fact, highlighted by this film, does not erase political, social and cultural differences.  If everyone saw this film, perhaps (and only perhaps) there would be less endorsements of war.  Maybe that's a bit too hipeful, since wars are almost always these days presented as humanitarian wars by those who benefit from them.

One must marvel at the courage of our ancestors to undertake the great trek out of Africa.  It's easy to understand going to Australia, but why did some migrate to the coldest regions of Siberia?  That's the question I have.",1114560000,56,1139,5.048128342245989
1828888,5,B000086K3E,"The Journey of Man video follows the camera / scientific team as the travel the world testing the DNA of indigenous people.  They first looking for the oldest DNA, which is defined as that with the fewest micro mutations. Mutations are cumulative over time, according to the theory, so the population with the fewest modifications is the ""father"" population for all other populations.  They found a tribe in Africa who had DNA from which all other human cultures and migrations have descended.  The video scientific team started their tour there interviewing members of the tribe which still has the oldest DNA.

Unsaid, but which logically follows is that the culture of the tribe with the oldest DNA must at some time in their history have had the oldest culture. Their language and culture was the primordial language and culture from which all other human populations have sprung. It's likely that some part of their original language and culture, modified somewhat over time, still survives among their modern day people.  During the interview of tribal members one can't help but notice that their language has many clicking sounds, grunts, and other noises quite unlike most modern languages.

I watched this video on PBS on the same day that I watched a documentary about chimpanzees.  In the chimp documentary the scientist had been living with the chimp population for several years trying to learn the chimp language.  He played recordings of several chimp words and phrases that he had been able to learn.  To my astonishment, it sounded very like the clicks and grunt language of the oldest DNA human tribe.  I understand no words of either language, but just listening to the tone, clicks, grunts, noises, tempo of both languages, one after the other, they sounded very similar. Can the oldest human language be linguistically related to that of chimpanzees? It sure sounds similar, and unlike any other language that I'm aware of.  I was amazed.  I had to have the video.

The rest of the Journey of Man documents the author's travels following human evolution to India, Australia, China, and finally into Europe and America.  It's a good documentary full of far off places and scientific evidence.  Despite the arrogance of the talking head scientist it's well worth having.",1113955200,14,2290,5.005277044854881

The work Dr. Wells and the other researchers have performed is almost magical.  Imagine tracing the development of mans involvement on earth through DNA from men?!  The work is wonderful, insightful and leaves the viewer with a sense that science has truly solved the issue of where we came from.  Do your family a favor and buy this one.

Dr. Wells did his undergraduate work at the University of Texas, gradwork at Harvard, and post doc work at Stanford and Oxford.  All of this was completed at a very early age.  He is brilliant.  Whether or not one agrees with his premise, this DVD is very well done, fascinatingly thorough, and hugely entertaining as well as highly educational.  Additionally, I had to opportunity to hear him speak on the subject when he visited Houston.  He was as charming in person as he was in the DVD.  He may be one of the most intelligent people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  We are fortunate to have him working in our country in this field.",1096329600,16,761,4.385714285714286
1828891,5,B000086K3E,"This is a 5 star production and authentically based upon an overwhelming amount of evidence from multiple sources. All of the reviews are on target. (To jrmcgrail. Don't let the style the author's on-screen style to overshadow substance.)

My advice is READ THE BOOK!  The video doesn't do justice to the overwhelming amount of evidence from notable researchers all over the globe.  This is not a pet theory of one man - Spenser Wells.  Wells is reporting on the scientific research of an army of brilliant men and women who are detailed in the book.  But, this does not come out as much in the video. In the book Wells does an excellent job of integrating all of the research, including Darwin's, into an understandable and comprehesible whole.  In the book, Wells credits all the other researchers.  Think of Wells as a very capable sythesizer.

I would also recommend reading The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa (also in video from the Discovery Channel).  The author, Stephen Oppenheimer, traces the female mitochondrial gene and adds an additional dimension to the research.

A conclusion I think important is that we are not decended from the apes nor are we an evolutionary product from other prehistoric beings, e.g., neanderthal, cromagmon, etc. We evolved as a distict species that survived and thrived while the others did not.  It is an interesting fact is that, at an identifiable point in time there was a great leap forward, a new age of elightenment when modern man suddenly appeared.  (Also read the Phenomenon of Man by Teilhard de Chardin who also comments on this fact).

I find the ""origin of man"" studies extremely interesting and continue to read from a personal scientific, spiritual and religious viewpoint, not to win any arguments.",1095379200,20,1771,4.922558922558922
1828892,5,B000086K3E,"I first saw this when it premiered on PBS while I was at the beginning of my world travels in January 2003.  One of the reasons I quit my job to go traveling was to satisfy my desire to know the truth about religion and spirituality. I traveled throughout Asia (As far West as India & Nepal), Australia, South America, and parts of Arabia.  Africa awaits.

The show on PBS couldn't have been more timely as I watched it in a hotel room while in Arizona. (Started with a cross country USA drive) I have read/studied & watched numerous videos and books on evolution, different religions, etc... at least from a scientific standpoint this video in one stroke puts MANY (Not all) of the claims of various religions / belief systems into the category of ""Comfort stories."" THAT IS - if you believe in the science.

I found quite interesting the reaction of some of the people when confronted with these new discoveries.  Old habits/beliefs die hard as evidenced by world events today and in the past century of rapid scientific thought and change on our world.  Granted, the host Spencer Wells could have presented some of his findings in a slightly more ""soothing"" manner to some of the target groups. But, he recognized this early on I think and modified his approach. His enthusiasm and confidence are infectious and make watching the video fun - even after I watched it again on DVD since I have returned from traveling.

This show is so compelling and complete in its coverage of how we/man evolved and traveled out of Africa. Dr. Wells travels to Namibia, Kazakhstan, Siberia, Arizona, Brazil, North Australia, and South India among other places. He incorporates interviews with other scientists to support his work - such as linguists.  While I didn't use DNA analysis in my travels to answer my questions, my insights into human psychology and observation of behavior only complemented what is in the video.

This is one of those videos (BBC's Blue Planet is another one) that I place in a special category of videos that should be mass distributed for free to every household possible around the world.

I also *HIGHLY* recommend the Shape of Life 4-DVD set, the logical prequel to the Journey of Man. For a broader picture of how we fit in our world - I also *HIGHLY* recommend National Geographic's Strange Days on Planet Earth 2-DVD set.",1094083200,168,2344,4.737100737100737
