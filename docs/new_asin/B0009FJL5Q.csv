8752080,1,B0009FJL5Q,"If this DVD is as bad as ""Pro Sports - Men of Tennis"", then it is a low quality piece of terd. It looks like the exact same people made it, which means it isn't worth the disc it was burned on. No quality footage or matches, no interesting bio's on players, and grainy footage repeated over and over is what you can expect. Avoid!",1192752000,3,330,4.092307692307692
