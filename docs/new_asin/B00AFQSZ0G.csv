5423846,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"A day or two after I saw this film, I was still grinning.  Diana Vreeland, not unlike Auntie Mame, understood that life really IS a banquet.  She was one of those remarkable ""People Who Notice""; and through her unquenchable curiosity and enthusiasm she made us notice too. When I was a young person, growing up in Blue Collar USA, I scraped together allowance money to buy Vogue.  It widened my horizons, and affirmed my urge to get to the Big City and become part of an urban creative environment.  No mere ""fashion rag"", the exuberance and style of Vogue magazine represented a wider world - a place where anything could happen.  Watching this film, we get to eavesdrop on that unique/lavish period in publishing, where boundaries were expanded, ideas flourished, and that giddy sense of ""Why NOT?!"" was rampant.  This film covers her whole life (not just the years at Vogue) and it is a wonderfully-conceived cultural Time Capsule - with crisp, fast-paced editing, and a wealth of captivating images.  Best of all, it is a marvelous, rollicking and thoughtful look at a singular Woman Of Influence.  I enjoyed this film for dozens of reasons!",1356480000,69,1145,4.835897435897436
5423847,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"This is one of those films that makes you feel good. A brilliant woman, and delightfully eccentric, her impact on the fashion world (and beyond) is legendary. The film has several interviews with her and does a wonderful job telling the story of her life and career. The pace dips a little towards the end, but not enough to detract from this wonderful film. Diana is so captivating, full of energy, brilliant, and fun (albeit a tough cookie). Watching this film, there were several times I thought ""I need to remember that quote!"" Visually, the film is an absolute treat, and I highly recommend the book by the same name if you want a coffee table version of this movie. Bottom line, I would love to have lunch with Diana Vreeland... but since that is not possible this is the next best option.

I was hoping to give it as Christmas gifts, but they are not releasing it until February...  which is too bad because this would have made wonderful stocking stuffers (Chanel stockings, of course!)",1355529600,36,994,4.642045454545454
5423848,4,B00AFQSZ0G,"What a woman!  Some documentaries one gets the sense of having to gently inflate a person's significance or contributions, whereas in this documentary it seemed the opposite... needing to play down the scale of her impact to even be believed to non-industry people.  I think Vogue magazine still contains some of the DNA of her philosophies and outlooks, much to its credit.",1496534400,,374,5.016129032258065
5423849,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"Visually fascinating, well edited and well told story of a singular personality.  It was interesting to watch after seeing a bio of Sophie Tucker, who also created herself a style because she didn't fit it to the usual category of the pretty songbird. Here's to individuality.",1495843200,,276,5.0
5423850,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"I love this documentary!  I remember seeing photos of Diana Vreeland in W Magazine and other socialite publications way back when but, I never really knew who she was.  This documentary is fun and entertaining because she is!  What an amazing woman, so full of life.  And she was certainly a maverick. Terrific documentary. (If you've seen the documentary Iris Apfel and therefore, are not considering this one, you're making a mistake.  I did not care for the Iris documentary.  It was poorly done, and frankly pretty boring, in my opinion. The Eye has to Travei is interesting and enjoyable! You will fall in love with Diana.)",1492992000,,628,4.822429906542056

5423855,3,B00AFQSZ0G,"Diana Vreeland had a great deal of originality. However, the one idea not expressed in the video is fashion magazines are about SELLING CLOTHES to different demographic groups from the wealthy women who can afford couture to the rest of women who purchase ready to wear. She was fired from Vogue because the advertisers who manufacture the clothes felt she wasn't promoting sales of their clothes. I suppose her imaginative genius was realized when she became special consultant at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and created exhibitions of clothing from the past. She was definitely imaginative and understood the historical significance of clothes. This is definitely a video for dreamers not realists. Practicality was not a word in Vreeland's vocabulary.",1482969600,3,757,5.316666666666666

5423894,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"I had seen this for free on streaming and was so impressed that I wanted a copy for my own. Wow, what an inspiration! She did not have any of the qualities that one is told you need to be a success. She did not have the money, connections, beauty or education. She could have just married and stayed at home as many women of her era had done. But she did not, and we are all the better for it. She had a love of fashion and a real curiosity for the new or different. This was brought to the magazine and made it more than just what clothes are in fashion for the season. She was giving women power and daring them to look at themselves and the world in a different way. If you are interested in fashion, you will enjoy this. If you want to have your own business or become more successful in your current position, order this today. This is not just about pretty clothes, but about finding and claiming your power.",1470787200,2,914,4.140449438202247

5423900,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"What a woman!  She may not have been easy to work for, but what a character!  This vid is based on some tape interviews Mrs. Vreeland did with George Plimpton for her memoirs.  You will also see a young Jane Pauley, Dick Cavett, Diane Sawyer and other news people interviewing Mrs. Vreeland.  She always had something interesting to say.  Her vision of what a fashion magazine could be started at Harpers Bazaar and she went on to Vogue.  My favorite quote.  ""I was only 70, what was I supposed to do?  Retire?""  I did not like the ending of the film, it smacked a little of being cheesy, but Diana Vreeland is the one and only star of this piece.  They did show some vintage photos from Bazaar and Vogue and that was fun.  Hearing her memories of models and personalities of the day.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I do want to say that I think it is a shame that the Costume Institute at the Met is not named jointly for both Mrs. Vreeland and Anna Wintour.  Mrs. Vreeland started the Met Gala and Anna Wintour made it what it is today.  In my mind both women are important to the Costume Institute.",1464998400,6,1104,4.317073170731708

5423908,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"As a writer of fashion fiction I was naturally drawn to this. This is a fascinating look at the life of the creative force that was Diana Vreeland. I do feel its a slightly romantic account of her life, but that does not lessen its impact and great interest.

We see that Diana had quite a privileged bohemian upbringing and is quite free spirited in her outlook and behaviour. Her early life was spent in London and Paris where she meets Coco Chanel who helps to develop her sense of style before her family move to America at the start of the Second World War.

Although very hardworking she seems to drift with ease into the world of fashion journalism and takes a unique visionary approach that quickly gets her noticed and promoted. I felt she was a great romantic, everything was her take on something and this was often glamorous, exotic, expensive, glossy and as I say highly romanticised. Her creative force knew absolutely no boundaries and once ensconced at Vogue she was very demanding but had great energy and her fashion layouts while stunning, glamorous and groundbreaking were complicated and time consuming costing a fortune. Ultimately leading to her leaving Vogue.

However her visionary talent was noted and she ended up at the Metropolitan museum in New York using their historic and extensive couture collections in a new innovative story telling way, opening up a whole new world of fashion to the public. Diana was an innovator, a leader of style and never a follower of fashion. She was also a force to be reckoned with. I liked her very much.",1445299200,,1568,4.736263736263736

And even better- Vreeland's link to earlier ones.  Mentor/friend to Lauren Bacall, Jackie Kennedy and many others, she was a visionary and something of a loon, one who saw aspects and relationships others didn't, a co-founder of the ""youthquake"" of the 1960s (in her 60s!) at the helm of Vogue Magazine.  While a citizen of the world, she was quintessentially, gloriously American- she marched to the beat of her own drum.  In the 1995 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Wong-Foo-Thanks-for-Everything/dp/B002FVG5EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!</a>, Patrick Swayze hands a copy of Vreeland's autobiography to a thrift-store clerk and tells him to ""commit sections to memory""- this film explains why.

Jack Nicholson, the roaring 20s, Charles Lindbergh, Coco Chanel, Twiggy, Mick Jagger, Russian Ballet, HIGH fashion, Richard Avedon, the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art... just watch it, much of it is purely and joyously visual and defies description- EYE CANDY, creativity on steroids.  Vreeland transformed the world, a dynamo, and her work at age 80 for the Met was just as revolutionary as it had been at Harper's Bazaar in her 30s.  Tremendously inspiring, both aging-wise and in getting the creative juices flowing.  Unlike anything else, recommended!",1422489600,,1516,5.672566371681416

5423977,4,B00AFQSZ0G,"I mostly enjoyed this DV documentary. You have to be in the mood to watch this fashion-centric biopic, and I found that, fashion-lover though I am- (Donatella Versace's 1994 Menswear collection was both the nadir of the House and it's reinvention, leading to the triumphant turnaround 1995 resort collection. Discuss)- it kind of got boring after a half hour. I had to take a break.

I could go on. Marc Jacobs. The grunge collection- how funny did that turn out. Alexander McQueen- what's going to happen over there? Let's not even get into John Galliano. Sigh.

It's a brutal, real world out there in this recession, and so much of this fashion talk is just BS. It's fluffy and fun, but kind of like eating cotton candy... I could only stomach it in small doses.

I'm enjoying watching it about 1/2 hour at a time. And this is from someone who can sit down and while away an afternoon off with Vogue and a glass of wine.

You kind of have to be in the mood. But if you are, it's very, very enjoyable eye candy.

DV is given to hyperbole and grandiose statements, a real character; a lot like famous fashion editor Polly Mellon:  Polly's co-workers joked that if she ever did a fashion shoot on the moon, she'd say:  ""Zero gravity... I see SCARVES!""

Life needs more characters like Vreeland. My remaining thought is, I really, really, really hope that she got to Zoolander. BLUE STEEL!",1389398400,,1387,4.564516129032258

5423999,4,B00AFQSZ0G,"(I rented to stream, and like much of my Amazon/Roku streaming this week it took several times to get it going.  Don't know what's up, or if its my ATT Uverse but something is broken).

I'm not a big one for celebrity bio-pics;  if I find myself wondering ""Who the hell are the Kardashians, and what did they do?"", a quick Google and a Wikipedia entry sates my curiosity.  Diana Vreeland (Dee-AHna to you, Dahlinks!) on on the other hand is one of those names and faces that keeps coming around, and with a face like that, in the fashion business, I figured I ought to find out.  It turns out that she was quite a talented gal, a regular Woman Of Substance, who came into contact with some of the best talent in fashion, art and culture there was, and she knew how to get them to do their best.  Having no degree,  Mrs. Vreeland  manages to seem simultaneously highly cultured and lightly educated, but knows what not to say and as a result, while some of the stuff she says isn't always bright, she never puts her foot in it.

Born in 1903, in Paris (but apparently not learning either French or English before sent to school, I'm rather confused on that part, what DID she speak, or didn't she?) Diana Vreeland came of age in the roaring twenties and then became an editor at Harpers by WWII; and then at Vogue, when after more than a decade Harpers had only upped her salary by $1000. a year.  At Vogue she helped put the face on much of the 1960s, being something of a free spirit open to anything new.  But, by the 80's she was forced out and came to indulge her life as a celebrity, taking a consultancy job at the Met organizing costume exhibits, which helps to explain why the DeYoung does the same at least once a year.

The film conveys its story through late-life TV interviews (Cavett, and Griffin) and for-TV interviews (Jane Pauley and Diane Sawyer) from her living room, which she called a ""garden in hell"".  There are also interviews with various Hollywood celebs who either modeled or worked for her in their early years;  various Fashionistas, and of course family---two sons, a grandson and a great grand daughter, who reads from Vreeland's pre-war Harpers series ""Why Don't You..."" with admirable pronunciation and enunciation for an American child.

Oddly enough, I don't remember seeing anyone interviewed as being simply ""a friend"".

The video footage is almost all late-Vreeland; the photos early to mid, with stock video to establish period flavor.  And there are the layouts from Harpers, and especially, Vogue.  It is here that the uninitiated like me come to see her brilliance.  Mrs. Vreeland (that's how she referred to herself) comes across as quite a character, and her family very likeable.  The interviews with celebs and fashionistas are tastefully celebratory, not the usual Hollywood brown-nosing excess.

Unfortunately, we don't get to hear Vreeland's thoughts on Jane Pauley's get up, which combined a cowgirl's hair-do, with what might have been a cowgirl's outfit, or perhaps a red and white circus tent.  Pauley seemed to see Mrs. Vreeland as something of an elderly eccentric aunt to be humored, and frequently rolls her eyes and smiles at the camera for no good reason, unless to identify with her suburban audience, which is probably much more erudite than she could imagine.

And then there's Mrs. Vreeland's ""garden in hell"" apartment, which is furnished on the More Is More principle.  Clutter is merely a point of departure;  and why have a pair of something if you can get three of them, or five maybe?  The polychromatic striped wallpaper is just for background.  The whole assemblage suggests a Vreeland inspired train wreck, where an Imperial Chinese Pullman was artfully crashed into a Belle Epoch Parisian boudoir, with Mrs. Vreeland center stage, an erstwhile Mandarin, perched on her couch like a throw pillow come to life, replete with draw-cord tassle ear rings.  And rouge.  Lots of rouge.  ""I LOVE rouge!""  Didn't she ever.

In any case, Diana Vreeland comes across as someone I'd like to have met, if not worked for, which brings to mind ""The Devil Wears Prada"".  In that flick, Meryl Streep plays a Vreeland-esque character based on a more recent Vogue tyrant-diva, Anna Wintour.  In one scene, Mrs. Priestly, as she's known, is shown throwing her coats on her assistant's desk, while barking orders, over a series of morning arrivals at the office.  Apparently, Mrs. Vreeland did just that to her assistant, Ali McGraw (""Love Story""), who threw it back at her.  Mrs. Vreeland then pronounced her to be the rudest person she'd ever met.  It seems that while times change, Fascist Fashionista Divas don't, really.  In any case, by my count, Mrs. Vreeland has 3 movies with characters based on her, and one went on to become a classic:  ""Funny Face"".

So, all in all it was a pleasant 90 minutes.  No life philosophy gained.  I'm not much of one for rouge, and I don't think it would help me, anyway;  and I can't go back and get myself born in Paris, maybe next life.  It was informative, though.  Helped to fill in some gaps, tie some loose ends, explain some of the recent past I'd not considered.",1374105600,2,5161,4.71731843575419

5424002,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"Pizzazz. Diana Vreeland had a spectacular gift for language, coining words and phrases that paintedin a single, vivid strokea feeling, a movement, a fantasy.

 You gotta have style. It helps you get down the stairs. It helps you get up in the morning. Its a way of life. Without it, you're nobody. Im not talking about lots of clothes.

 Prohibition. Insane idea. Try to keep me from taking a swallow of this tea and Ill drink the whole pot.

  Everything is new. At least everything is new the first time around.

 The West is boring itself to death! And talking itself to death!

 Id like to have been Elizabeth the First. She was wonderful. She surrounded herself with poets and writers, lived at Hampton Court, and drove that little team of spotted ponies with long tails....Shes at the top of my list. I loved the clothes. It took her four hours to dresswe have a lot in common!
 Where would fashion be without literature?

 Oh, but I think that thoughtfulness and manners are everything.

 Lighting  is everything in a color.

 This story went around about me: Apparently Id wanted a billiard-table green background for a picture. So the photographer went out and took the picture. I didn't like it. He went out and took it again and I still didn't like it. I asked for billiard-table green! Im supposed to have said. But this is a billiard table, Mrs. Vreeland, the photographer replied. My dear, I apparently said, I meant the idea of billiard-table green.

  I was the most economical thing that ever happened to the Hearst Corporation. Perhaps they loved me because I never knew how to get any money out of them.

  A lie to get  out of something, or take an advantage for oneself, thats one thing; but a lie to make life more interestingwell, thats entirely different.

  I have a terrible time remembering exactly when my birthday is. Age is totally boring...

 The best time to leave a party is when the partys just beginning. Theres no drink that kills except the drink that you didn't want to take, as the saying goes, and theres no hour that kills except the hour you stayed after you wanted to go home.

More? See the movie, buy her books.  Sorry, Diana, you left too soon.

5424013,4,B00AFQSZ0G,"I am a 47-year-old male. I do not pay much attention to what I wear, but I know such names as Manolo Blahnik and Anna Wintour. Yesterday, I happened to have a chance to watch ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel"", a documentary about this extraordinary magazine editor and legendary fashion icon, and to my surprise and delight I found it very engaging and inspiring, even though I don't read ""Vogue"" or any fashion magazines.

The documentary is actually more like a visual tribute to Diana Vreeland than an in-depth study of her as a fashion editor or a person. The film recreates her time and life story with archive footage of Diana Vreeland (which is fascinating, often very funny) and interviews with people including Anjelica Huston, Ali MacGraw, Manolo Blahnik, Calvin Klein and Anna Sui as well as photographer David Bailey and film director Joel Schumacher to name a few. It is a 'talking heads' style interview, but what they have to say is interesting, some effusive in praise.

Diana's sons Tim and Frecky are also interviewed. They talk about Diana Vreeland in a more reserved tone, but it is not difficult to imagine how they feel about their mother. As if to respect the will of Diana herself who in archive footage refuses to talk about what she doesn't want, the film does not explore her personal life very much.

The film is not myth-making, but some viewers may not like the film's tendencies for telling (in Diana's own word) ""faction."" The documentary uses footage from such movies as ""Funny Face"" and ""Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?"" to show how she was like as a demanding editor. I think I get the point and I like that method, though I wanted to hear more from those who worked with her.

Probably those who have already know Diana Vreeland and her life will find the film a bit cursory, but ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel"" is still a very entertaining watch.",1367280000,,1892,4.638805970149254

5424040,3,B00AFQSZ0G,"""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel"" is a cinematic complement to the book of the same name, co-authored by Diana Vreeland's granddaughter-in-law Lisa Immordino Vreeland, who co-directed the film as well. It chronicles the life and work of Diana Vreeland (n&eacute;e Dalziel), who was born to affluence in 1903 Belle &Eacute;poque Paris, moved to the United States a decade later, and went on to become the influential fashion editor of ""Harper's Bizarre"" for 26 years, followed by an even more influential stint as editor-and-chief of ""Vogue"" for 9 years, topped off by ground-breaking work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in the 1970s. Vreeland's story is told through showcases of her work, interviews with family and colleagues, and through a voiceover commentary taken from interviews Vreeland gave her biographer in 1983, which I believe is delivered by an actress in the film.

Diana Vreeland had an important influence on Western culture of the 20th century. She understood style. She invented female glamour. She introduced the bikini bathing suit to America. She presented fashion and fashion photography as art. She made models into personalities. She understood cultural trends and upheavals as they were taking place and knew that people want to express their relationship to their culture in the way they dress. And she showed them how. She was very powerful in her own way. It's unfortunate that fashion is not taken more seriously by historians, unless they are fashion historians, as so much is represented in fashion, especially in times of rapid change: new technologies, changing roles and values. Vreeland also introduced the conspicuously ugly model which is unfortunately still a staple of the fashion industry.

""The Eye Has to Travel"" is interesting as far as it goes, and Vreeland was a strong and colorful personality who freely expressed her opinions. She's an ideal subject. The tidbits about her life, the striking magazine spreads, and archival interviews with Vreeland herself whetted my appetite for information about the woman and her work. But I felt let down, because the film is not at all analytical. It doesn't examine the relationship between Vreeland's ideas and the cultures they expressed and, at the same time, shaped. Or where the ideas came from, where they ended up, and what that means. It doesn't examine how her own insecurities influenced what she put on the page -though they obviously did. It doesn't examine the fallout of supermodels and ugly models. And since discussion of her broader impact is scarce, there is no thought given to what among her work is good or bad.

This is a nice introduction to the work of Diana Vreeland, but a documentary needs to do more than just showcase the woman and her work. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH on the Entertainment One (2013) DVD. Bonus features are additional interview footage (approximately 35 minutes) and a theatrical trailer (2 min).",1362182400,17,2986,5.1273100616016425

In today's fashion/style market, such icons with the power to change and form public opinion on taste and style, are next to impossible to find - except for Anna Wintour perhaps, but she's a different story.

5424047,4,B00AFQSZ0G,"I had been looking forward to seeing this documentary for quite some time and it finally arrived in the theater here in Cincinnati this weekend. You betcha I went to see this right away! In the Fall of 2011, a hardcover book called ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel"" was released, to critical acclaim. Now finally comes the documentary.

""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel"" (2012 release; 86 min.) starts with a brilliant opening credits/photo-montage as the soundtrack features the Rolling Stones' ""She's A Rainbow"". After that introduction, we get a chronological look back on Diana's life. The beauty is that Diana herself does most of the talking in the documentary (taken from tapes she recorded for her auto-biography ""D.V."" in the early 80s). Of course there are a lot of celebrities (both A and B lists) giving their thoughts on how Diana influenced the fashion industry when she was at Harper's Bazaar and later at Vogue. When Diana found a new ""face"" (such as Cher, or Twiggy, or Barbra Streisand, or Lauren Hutton), ""she saw things in people before they saw it in themselves"", comments someone. Tellingly, Diana later observes ""It's not the dress, it's the life you live in the dress"", which to me makes clear that fashion for Diana is not a end to itself, simply a means. Another quote from Diana later on that struck me: ""I shall die young. I don't know whether it will be at 70, 80 or 90. But I shall die young!"". Diana lived to be 86, and yes, she died young.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this documentary is a celebration of the genuis in Diana Vreeland, truly a remarkable woman on every level. Second, the movie is mostly a collection of interviews (some of them from vintage footage, check out for example the very young Diana Sawyer as she interviews Vreeland) and photo-montages from old Bazaar and Vogue article lay-outs, so that may sound pretty boring, but in fact it is fascinating to see ""the old stuff"" and I was surprised how visually appealing and entertaining this documentary is. This will appeal obviously to fahsion enthousiasts but I am quite certain that it will also win over the ""average"" viewer, if given a chance. Bottom line, ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1358467200,23,2249,4.764102564102564

8551127,5,B00AFQSZ0G,"Diana Vreeland is one of those names that rings a bell, but not sure why. She was born in 1903 in Paris to socialite parents and moved to the US during WWI. She did not have a memorable relationship with her mother, who told her as a child that she was extremely ugly.  She spent the '20s dancing in Harlem, and was known as being 'fast', then moved to London and started a lingerie business. Diana was not beautiful but had style, and as the director of this documentary, her grand daughter -in-law  tells us, she led quite a life.

Diana met the love of her life, Drew Vreeland, and their had two sons, Frederick and Tim, who tell us with some angst that she was not a good mother. She realized she needed to work and with her style and joy of life, she had two influential magazine jobs: first becoming fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar, then editor-in-chief at Vogue. Diana's time at these magazines were filled with brilliance and inventiveness. Models like Verushka to photographers like David Bailey and designers Manolo Blahnik, discuss her influence, then continue with colorful accounts of her life. Throughout the film we see hints of a demanding, unpleasant Diana told from actress Ali McGraw. Diana was excessive in the money she spent, and she was eventually let go.

Diana did not stay unemployed for long. She was hired to reimagine the costumes at the Metropolitan Museum. Thus became a very huge success, and as we can see, that continues through this day. Not much of Diana's personal life is discuss, but we are told she was unemotional, and that came from her sons. Certainly a woman if her time, but not at home.
