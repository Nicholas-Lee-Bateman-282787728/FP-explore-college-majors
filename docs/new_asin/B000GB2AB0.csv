8130163,5,B000GB2AB0,"This is a generally well acted piece about the difficult subject of the treatment of orphaned and homeless children in early industrial revolution era France. Although the events depicted are bleak and depressing, this film is in many ways lighter in tone than similar Dickensian pieces. Robinson Stevenin is a discovery in this film, and his character will charm you.",1412380800,,368,5.15
8130164,5,B000GB2AB0,"This film is a very good, albeit fictional, history piece. I highly recommend it for those who are interested in learning what conditions children, especially the poor, had to endure.
*Even as recently as the 20th century in the United States, children were considered an exploitable resource of cheap labor, especially in poor families that needed the extra income just to survive. The editorial review gives a good summary of what this film is about.",1210464000,,452,5.04
