8724188,5,B011H0D6S4,Lee Min Ho  did very well in this movie. He is branching  in his acting roles. He is a movie star in my book.  The scenery and costumes or well done for the time period. Though the movie is a little dark I still enjoyed it. The character actors were great.,1442793600,2,256,3.980392156862745
