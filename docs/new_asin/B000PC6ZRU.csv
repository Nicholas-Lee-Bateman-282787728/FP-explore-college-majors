8190302,5,B000PC6ZRU,"This excellent series written by Graham Lineham (who wrote Father Ted) is four and a half stars for me. The main characters are a mixture of the worst that you see with IT people. Roy is a slob and Moss is geek. Worst of all they don't like dealing with IT problems! They have a tape recorder which they run to answer the phone. It says things like ""Have you tried turning it off and on?"" They work in the basement in a world of their own and usually upset any staff who come down to visit them. Moss in particular seems to have no understanding of reality at all and behaves very oddly at times, which is very funny.

Their new boss Jen knows nothing about IT and has been given the job of Manager of IT by the Managing Director, because she lied on her CV. The Managing Director is played by Chris Morris and he is the best thing about the show. Truly this man is one of the great unsung heros of British comedy. Remember The Day Today, with the Jeremy Paxman like front man - thats him. Whenever he is in a scene he steals the show from everybody else.

The show as a whole is well worth getting on DVD as it certainly holds up to repeated viewings.",1191196800,4,1152,4.138392857142857
