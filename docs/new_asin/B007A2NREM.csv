5071435,4,B007A2NREM,"I was taken by surprise by this movie at the Austin Film Festival, which was a HUGE hit with the audiences there. Comedy is hard, and directors Brett and Drew Pierce make it look easy. It's a fast-paced zombie romance about a guy who just wants to hit the road to find his girlfriend, and can't understand why everyone's shooting at him! Throw in a mad scientist plot, limbs that keep dropping off at inopportune moments, sufficient gore and a vegetarian zombie, and you've got a really fun movie.
While it's affectionate and faithful to the zombie genre, it introduces new questions into old folklore. For instance, what if someone's immune system is able to resist the virus, so a person only gets a ""light"" case? ""Deadheads"" makes you care about the characters, and leaves you rolling your eyes and grinning stupidly at the end. Watch for a very funny and physical Markus Taylor who gets laughs without any actual lines.",1330905600,7,923,4.739130434782608
5071436,5,B007A2NREM,"There is nothing I didn't love about this film!  The heroes of the film are Zombies -- poor Mike wakes up to find himself dead, with some loose ends to tie up, like letting the girl he loves know that he didn't want to leave her.  He finds himself another Zombie, Brent, who believes that being dead is no reason to stop living the good life, and off they go!  They are pursued by all kinds of people, alive and not-so-alive.  The confrontations between the good Zombies and the flesh-eating variety Zombies, and between the good guys and the evil scientists, are inspired!  Mike and Brent hitch a ride across the country to find the love of Mike's life...and death....and confront what really happened to him.  These zombies are the good guys, and you find yourself rooting for them every step of the way.  This is a road trip movie, and buddy flick, a romance, and oh, yeah, a zombie flick.  Campy, yes.  Funny, definitely!  Sam Raimi, move over!",1330041600,14,948,4.556213017751479

5071439,4,B007A2NREM,"Yes folks this is a Zombie, Comedy, Road Movie with a love interest bags of laughs (you will split your sides - ho ho) and it is great fun. I will give you the basic synopsis. Two Zombies realise that they cannot only still speak but seem to have the ability of free thought, fear and sarcasm too. Mike Kellerman (Michael McKiddy) starts to remember when he was alive and things become clearer when he finds an engagement ring! Yes he was and realises he still is in love - bless. Only problem is he doesn't look his best, he has been dead for three years and apart from the obvious odour issues he has some noticeable bullet holes and his arm keeps falling off.

But help comes in the unlikely looking Brent Guthrie (Ross Kidder), a fellow sentient Zombie, who suggests that they ought to deliver the ring anyway just to put the record straight. This they decide to do and start their road trip with a great old guy Cliff and an adopted Zombie called `Cheese' who seems to respond to doggy commands rather than the usual human banter. Like all good road trips they only have one rule and this is? No eating humans - typical.

The sub plot comes in an evil drugs company who want them dead or experimented on or both, either way they really need to put some space between each other but it aint gonna be easy as they is some bad bottomed mother fornicator types.

This is a film I thought was going to be trashy and the only saving grace being  able to fritter away an hour and a half, and I was way off the mark. It is a genre bender in the talking, thinking Zombie angle, but it really works. They are very aware of their situation and take it with acceptance, humour pathos and lots of cod psychology. There is also a load of real humour, the laugh out loud stuff and not the gross arm eating stuff either. I laughed on more than one occasion and better still I was rooting for these guys. Because no matter how bad thing got they kept on trying and there was real warmth coming from the performances.

I think that is why it worked so well, we do have chemistry between all the main players, that and the evil sub plot and the lost love all just combined to make a very enjoyable film indeed. There is a lot of the gore you would expect but it is far from gratuitous. Not just for Zombie fans, not just for comedy fans but for one hundred per cent Zom - Com fans - you know it makes sense.",1329955200,13,2393,4.216157205240175

5071454,5,B007A2NREM,"Attention all you Zombie/Comedy movie fans out there. I just watched an excellent little independent feature made right here in my home state of Michigan titled DeadHeads that will have you laughing your ass off. It is a charming little heartwarming tale of a young zombie's undying love for his still living girlfriend Ellie, and his trek to make it back to her to tell her one last time just how much he still loves her. Yes, this lovelorn zombie, named Mike, can talk and is actually self-aware of his plight and condition and is also intelligent (Well, about as intelligent as you can be for a zombie anyway) and finds himself being chased by an evil corporation that is out to use him in it's illegal genetic experimentations.

Along the way on his roadtrip adventure to see his girlfriend he meets another zombie named Brent who is also self-aware and can talk,  and together, along with their big dumb-but-loveable feral zombie sidekick which they dub with the nickname ""Cheese"", they all head out to Mike's girlfriend's house and find themselves getting into all kinds of mischief and trouble, and also learning a little bit about life, friendship, and love.

DeadHeads is one of the funniest zombie comedies that I have ever seen and it had me laughing from the beginning to the end, and even had my eyes watering with emotion in a couple of very touching scenes as well. For a very low-budget independent feature I was surprised at just how great and touching this movie actually is and believe that it will go down in history as a cult classic. Starring Michael McKiddy, Ross Kidder, Markus Taylor, and Natalie Victoria. I give DeadHeads two big zombiefied thumbs way up high!",1416355200,,1687,4.750853242320819

This movie is my pick for runner up of romantic zombie comedies, coming in second to Warm Bodies.
Either way its a want to watch movie.
DeadHeads is about two Guys that wake up after dying somehow & then realize they are zombies,
One of the zombies named Mike, has memories that slowly come back to him about his one true love and all he wants to do is find her &  get back to her & love her again, but in doing so the two ""coherent"" zombies find themselves being chased by a corrupt corporation scientist and 3 persistant Zombie hunters, One a follower who thinks he's the leader, another who should be the leader & that gets the job done, and a third that thinks he's rambo, & that's where the funny and crazy chase begins.

This movie is funny, it's witty and down right LMAO at times, but in the end it is one that you want to own and I bet its one of those movies that you will watch again and again.
This one has me thinking of my own love, and How I'm glad she accepted me into her life.

5071460,4,B007A2NREM,"DeadHeads (The Pierce Brothers, 2011)

If you watch comedies with any regularity, you've probably seen at least a dozen movies about guys who suddenly realize they've lost the love of their lives and embark on cross-country journeys to get them back with their layabout best friends in tow. DeadHeads keeps to the formula, but with one twist: the guy in question, and his layabout best friend, are both dead. Which doesn't actually change things as much as one might think.

Mike (Dead Man Down's Michael McKiddy) and Brent (Sam Hell's Ross Kidder) wake up with no memory of who they are or how they got where they are (the parking lot of a dive bar in rural Colorado) and why there seems to be a greater-than-average amount of carnage is the general vicinity. All of that's soon cleared up: the two are zombies, the place was just hit by a zombie attack, and Mike and Brent really suck at passing for breathers. The only piece of identification on either of them is a ring Mike has, which sparks memories of the girl he was going to propose to. Thus, with nothing better to do, the two of them head east to find Ellie (Lazarus' Natalie Victoria), the girl of Mike's dreams. Along the way, their party is completed by Cheese (Remembering Phil's Markus Taylor), a zombie who is more in line with the run-of-the-mill zombies that surround Mike and Brent (i.e., an unthinking creature with an unending hunger for brains--but despite that he's a nice guy, in a goofy kinda way) and a breather named Cliff (Harry Burkey in his first screen appearance), who has a pickup truck and a lot of time on his hands to drive a trio of zombies across the country (retirement will do that to you). But as they get closer to their goal, they start asking themselves some pointed questions, like why are they sentient when all the rest of the zombies they encounter are brainless?

Now, I am not going to try and make a case that this movie is anything other than the stupid zombedy that it is, silly and predictable and nothing necessarily out of the ordinary. But it's still a great amount of fun; the comic timing is perfect more often than not, the movie never takes itself overly seriously (it even takes a few potshots and the conventions of both road comedies and zombedies), and the Pierce brothers, who also wrote, actually spent enough time thinking about the resolution to all this to make it work in about the most satisfying way they could.  I had a ball with this one. *** ",1370908800,,2469,4.564334085778781

5071465,3,B007A2NREM,"When a film comes with an endorsement from horror legend Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead, Bubba Ho-Tep, Maniac Cop), you're going to pay attention! Campbell stated ""In a world of putrid zombie movies, Dead Heads is a breath of fresh air"".

Dead Heads is a 2011 horror comedy that comes with the tagline ""A road trip to die for."" and stars Michael McKiddy (The Retreat, Weenie Roast Massacre) and Ross Kidder (Sam Hell, Caregiver).

With a slew of film festival awards and after reading the synopsis, it certainly seemed like Dead Heads had something new to offer the genre; and to be honest I found the film to have a certain level of charm. However, I could not help but feel that the film was simply a road trip/ buddy movie which happened to feature two undead guys as its protagonists. Perhaps I am desensitised to gore etc now but the whole thing felt to me like some hybrid of horror and a forgettable mid-afternoon TV movie.
McKiddy very much plays the straight-man of the routine with Kidder almost a caricature of a wacky sidekick and for me, there was little in the way of laughs; and initially, I struggled with the concept of these two zombies still being sentient but this is explained during the movie.
The special effects and production values of the film cannot be faulted in the slightest and certainly seems that The Pierce Brothers have spent wisely with their budget. For me, the best character was the zombie hunter McDinkle, as played by Benjamin Webster. In fact, buying the DVD might just be worth it to see the gag reel and the actors cracking up at some of his improvised lines.

Awarded a 15 certificate by the BBFC for ""strong bloody gore and language"", Dead Heads is a technically proficient film with decent performances from the cast and effects that certainly don't disappoint. After the anticipation built by the praise from Campbell, the plaudits it had received and the general hype; the whole affair was just a bit vanilla for me: it was nice enough but didn't exactly leave me satisfied or indeed desperate for more.",1355443200,,2051,4.67590027700831
5071466,4,B007A2NREM,"This was a decently funny movie and a good addition to the zombie genre. It had some plot holes that showed up at the end, but it was worth the time and money I spent for it.",1353801600,,174,3.72972972972973
5071467,2,B007A2NREM,"The only thing potential viewers really need to know about this film is that it isn't so much a 'zomedy' as it is a teen romantic comedy...with zombies.  If you're favorable toward teen romantic comedies, then you'll probably like this flick.  If that's not your bag, then even if you are a big zombie movie fan, you'll likely be disappointed.  Instead of 'Shaun of the Dead', 'DeadHeads' is closer to 'Better off Dead'.

But, even with that exception, 'DeadHeads' still has other problems.  Michael McKiddy and Ross Kidder are ok as the leads, but few of the other actors measure up.  And while the plot holes aren't as big of a problem, the ridiculous ending was.  For reasons never explained, Michael McKiddy and Ross Kidder are zombies who still have all their faculties while the rest of the horde are the mindless corpses we've grown accustomed to seeing.  Determined to travel cross-country and finally tell his girlfriend his real feelings for her, McKiddy refuses to let a little thing like being dead stand in his way.  With nothing much else going on, Kidder and a trained zombie pet named Cheese decide to go along, not knowing they are also the subject of an intense zombie hunt by inept government forces.  Will McKiddy find true love that transcends the grave, or will he lose his nerve before he even tries?

Like I said, more of a romantic comedy/buddy road trip movie than anything else.  Sort of a bizarre date movie.  Zombie fans may be disappointed.",1350604800,,1470,4.74015748031496

5071470,4,B007A2NREM,"DeadHeads is a fun romp that was written and directed by Brett and Drew T. Pierce (brothers and son of Bart Pierce who was the special effects photographer of a film you may have heard of - The Evil Dead) who really were able to put together a fun romp in a world of the undead. Speaking of the writer's heritage they did stick a small scene at a drive-in theater that shows them watching The Evil Dead. You probably aren't going to recognize most of the cast in this film though overtime I'm sure we're all going to be hoping to see more of them.

Honestly it takes a lot for zombie comedies to impress me. Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland both pulled it off but few others have been able to really make me enjoy them past that. Mix in the fact that I generally hate intelligent zombies and you know I'm going to be watching DeadHeads with a highly critical eye as our two main characters are both intelligent zombies.

While it didn't pull off the perfect mix of outbreak and humor of SOTD and Zombieland I found myself fully enjoying DeadHeads. The characters were likable, the situations were mostly entertaining, and the flow was fluid as one scene blended perfectly into the next. Most importantly they took an idea (the buddy road trip to save a relationship) and stuck it into a zombie apocalypse in a way that hasn't been done before! At least not in a film that I've seen!

We begin the movie as Mike finds himself trapped in a laboratory and runs to escape whoever had him captured. He quickly stumbles across a full blown zombie apocalypse is in the process of spreading. What he doesn't realize is that he is one of the living dead. He stumbles across another fellow not so quite brain dead brain eater named Brent and they slowly piece together what happened. It goes extra slow as both of seem to be suffering from memory loss that is slowly returning but the emphasis is on slowly.

When Mike remembers a woman that he loves they set on a road trip to get him back to the only memory he has that he seems to give a damn about. The journey itself is not easy. They are being hunted by the military, rednecks, a man trying to kill all of the undead, AND they need to get there before the zombie outbreak truly spreads across the globe.

Humor ensues as they bring one of of the living dead along with them who seems to be following them like a lost puppy. What will happen when Mike finds his lost love? Who is behind the chaos that is happening?

You are going to have to rent or buy the film to find it all out and while not all of the humor hits the high notes it strives for you should find the movie to be a fun visit into the lands of the undead.",1349049600,,2666,4.258893280632411
5071471,4,B007A2NREM,"Sometimes a film maker just knows what he wants to do and does it. Sometimes he's right. Sometimes he's wrong. This one is right in spades.

Here's the scoop. Something has gone wrong and a bunch of people have turned into flesh eating zombies. Typical George Romero-ish zombies. But what about Mike and Brent? They're zombies, but they can think, don't crave flesh and move around like normal folk. Mike is dead because he took two bullets in the head. He just doesn't remember how it happened. Brent died during an episode of auto-erotic asphyxiation. All Mike wants to do is go see the girl he loved and propose to here. Brent will do all he can to help Mike, even though some government types are on their tail to bring them back to HQ. So begins this bizarre odyssey.

This is a devilishly clever film. It's outrageously funny and even touching at times. The brothers Brett and Drew Pierce, working as both writers and directors, don't have a lot of credits under their belts which makes this an even bigger surprise. They show a deft hand at both tasks which tells me they could go on to have formidable careers as film makers. They pay great attention to small details that underscore the fun they have with the genre. There are also a lot of in jokes and small explorations into the genre as a whole. There is one funny scene involving a conversation on the weaknesses of various boogie men and questions as to how they were discovered and how arbitrary they are. The movie is full of stuff like that.

This is modestly budgeted but just enough was spent to raise it comfortably above the level of student film. It seems much of the money was spent on gore effects and they did a really cool job. The craft here, in general, is as good as it needs to be. What this has going for it is good writing, good characters and a great sense of fun. Order up some pizza.

5071478,4,B007A2NREM,"I have always been an avid horror fan, and have a soft spot for a good zombie flick. That said, with the ever-expanding zombie-craze at its peak, the past several years have brought more downs than ups in this particular genre.

Although I hadn't heard much about ""DeadHeads"" before watching it, I won't lie to you--I went into this with low expectations. I fully assumed that this would be little more than another plot-less gorefest littered with unnecessary nudity and mediocre special effects. Within just minutes, however, I found myself pleasantly surprised. Despite a few logistical discrepancies (why do only select zombies have full brain function? And I have both scientific and moral concerns regarding the zombie-human relations and its inevitable ties to necrophilia should the star-crossed lovers decide to consummate their love), the point-of-view spin on this zombie comedy is certainly intriguing.

In addition to the very original ill-fated love story at its center, the buddy roadtrip humor along the way definitely lends itself to the film's success. While some of the acting done by minor characters comes across as cheesy and over-the-top at times, the chemistry between the two main zombie pals, Mike (Michael McKiddy) and Brent (Ross Kidder) is what keeps you grounded in the story. In addition, Thomas Galasso is surprisingly likeable as a rogue convict-turned-zombie hunter, and let's not forget their loveable pal Cheese (Markus Taylor), who becomes a sort of brainless zombie pet to the others.

Despite it's incredibly tight budget, the zombie makeup and special effects in this movie were also quite impressive. There wasn't a single moment during which I was taken out of the film due to amateur mistakes, which is rare in this genre. The filmmakers behind this little zombie gem definitely know what they are doing, and other budding independent filmmakers will do well to take note.

Overall, I would say that this is a film worth watching for just about anyone--particularly those with a penchant for buddy comedies or zombie films. Sprinkled with pop culture references throughout (I especially appreciated the homage to ""The Evil Dead""), ""DeadHeads"" does a great job of paying tribute to similar films of the past while telling a story that is still fresh and relevant to current times.",1339545600,,2322,5.184
5071479,3,B007A2NREM,"""DeadHeads"" is a lighthearted genre mix that is not easy to define. Is this a horror? Not exactly. Is this a comedy? It is, but a mildly amusing one. It is more like a zombie movie-meets-comedy-meets-romance, but the film's real originality comes from the main characters Mike (Michael McKiddy) and Brent (Ross Kidder), zombie heroes who walk and talk like humans.

The story follows one `undead' Mike, who wakes up to find that three years has passed since the last time he was awake. He has also been transported to a strange place, where he witnesses a zombie outbreak. But the biggest problem for Mike is that he is already dead. More precisely, he has also become a zombie (though he doesn't want to eat humans).

Believe me or not, this is part love story and part road movie. Mike decides to take a road trip to find his girlfriend, together with another ""living"" undead Brent, while being chased by zombie hunters hired by some mysterious institute.

The idea is very good, though the end result is not impressive. The film's pace is often slack and jokes are obvious. The film stumbles from one silly situation to another, without making a full use of the silliness. Some of the subplots (about who is responsible for the death of Mike) are underdeveloped. Overall acceptable, but not outstanding.",1337644800,,1306,4.769911504424779
5071480,5,B007A2NREM,"Arguably one of the most unique spins on The Buddy/Road/Zombie/Comedy genres ever. Shot on a shoestring budget, I went into this with extremely low expectations. What a pleasant surprise. This little indie gem should be required viewing for film school students, as it shows how creative and hot things can get, when you pull together with heart and passion to create a quality project. The Pierce brothers did their due diligence in pulling out the stops to get the perfect cast and crew to achieve their vision. Shot in Michigan in 2009, this unique spin on the Zombie theme breaths a deadly fresh breath into this saturated & stale genre. The leads Michael McKiddy & Ross Kidder are perfectly cast as the heroes Mike & Brent a Yin Yang relationship. They are joined in their sojourn by a few fellow travelers: Cheese, Cliff & Pei Pei. Suffice to say that that 2 salient zombies trekking across country in a world gone mad, pursued by some of the funniest over the top antagonists ever filmed leaves lots of room for stretching the creative palet. My favorite antagonists is McDinkel, a guy who has watched every Die Hard/ Rambo. Arnold action film and aspires to be them all in one testosterone fueled goofball, Played brilliantly by Ben Webster. Thomas Galasso as the stoic survivor / hero is a nod to Romero's lead in Night of the Living Dead, (but is a much better looking and a much better actor.) The remaining cast are fun, fierce, frivolous and faithful. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If you enjoy a laugh, a heart tug and zombie gore, this will be your next favorite movie. 95 minutes of creative bliss! Enjoy it, I did! Oh and so did Bruce Campbell!!",1335484800,3,1664,4.663265306122449
5071481,5,B007A2NREM,"I nearly give this film a miss. I was looking at the new releases in my local supermarket, looked at Deadheads and thought iit was another straight to dvd piece of crap. I picked up the box and saw the quote by the legendary Bruce Campbell. I love that guy so I thought why not. I bought it and watched it that night. I wasn't expecting the film to be so good. Very funny with zombies that you actually care about as they are eating cops. The cast, none of whom I had heard of, were great. I would happily recommend this film to anyone as it can't be pigeon holed. It isn't a horror film even though the leads are zombies. Its funny, romantic and at one point very moving. I give this film my highest recommendation.",1335225600,2,716,4.195652173913044
5071482,5,B007A2NREM,I'm not a horror movie fan but Deadheads proved to be much more than a blood and guts film. A solid story line that pulled you in with characters you cared about on a journey that keeps you laughing. I love this film.,1334102400,,217,4.069767441860465
5071483,3,B007A2NREM,"This is the story of Brent and Mike, two high funcioning zombies. They meet after death and set out on a journy to find a lost love.
Highly entertaining movie, yes very corny aswell, the on screen chemistry between the two leads is great and charasmatic enough to hold your attention.
If your a little tired of the same old zombie formular give this one a go, its a refreshing new twist on the zombie genre, don't take it too serious and you will enjoy this zombie buddy film
A must watch for all die hard zombie fans",1333756800,,517,4.285714285714286

Second - really a good story and yes, funny in a way I cannot really  say is silly, as it works, and the co-zombie (like a hippy toss back from a yogurt shop) - is just so well acted, that you gotta grin, if not laugh out loud -- and all with out spoiling the film as a good flick, in any fashion..... just very pleased and glad I made the purchase.",1333411200,,554,3.893805309734513

It was, by turns, hilarious, disturbing and tender. And if you're wondering how in the world those three words could ever come together as descriptives--well, I guess you'll just need to treat yourself to a viewing.

One of the few movies that I have watched a second time. All of the bad guys are humans and all the zombies are good guys, and it works. As if zombie nerds, zombie crackheads and zombies who can fetch aren't funny enough. The only thing missing is a girl in a tank top, which, from my experience is a requisite in every zombie movie, but that can be forgiven, because it was plenty funny.",1525046400,,515,4.319587628865979

Still the end result was a very well made film. The comedy was just right, the emotional scenes were well balanced, the characters were likeable, and all told it was a delight to watch. I wasn't even put off by the assortment of stereotype characters with over the top personalities. I would definitely recommend this to others.",1524096000,,475,4.804878048780488
