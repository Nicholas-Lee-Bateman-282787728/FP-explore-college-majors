30133,5,0780020715,"I was fortunate to grow up in a house that came with a projection room, which enabled me to see many wonderful movies on a regular basis. When I saw Beauty and the Beast I was mesmerized. I was about six years old when I  walked through the castle of the Beast and saw the wonderful human arms  projecting out of the wall holding lighted candleabra aloft...and the  fireplace decorated with real human figures that turned their heads and  blew smoke out of their mouths! It was a waking dream, seen through gauze,  and every  detail of that land was fascinating. I hoped for years this  would become available on video, and I strongly recommend this version.",927936000,,658,4.572649572649572

Though in this version Beauty only has one brother and there has been added a suitor  (Who IMHO looks almost like Gaston of Disney's.) these two characters make  up for the lost of Beauty's three. There has been some minor story changes,  most noticbly a less moralistic ending, but over all kept true to the  original work. It is a very captivating film, and the extras on the disc  help enhance the experience of an already great film.",911520000,,574,4.480769230769231

I understand that this is a pretty old movie, made in 1946 but it looks like a cheap movie from the 20s. The two actors who played the leads were too old for the parts and I have never seen worse editing in any movie in my life.  It did at least try to follow the original story but then changed something at the end which ruined the ending. So bad, just hated it.",1492646400,,486,4.0625
30145,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's film version of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's ""La Belle et la Bte"" is a wonder of cinema. Cocteau begins his film by imploring his audience to regain their childhood sense of wonder and imagination before presenting a story with all the trappings of a classic fairytale made real though some of the most gorgeous uses of cinematic technique and practical effects. Cocteau's Belle is truly a beauty and his Beast both monstrous and regal. When Belle first walks through the castle and sees phantom hands holding aloft the candlesticks, I defy a viewer not to gaze with wonder.
True, Disney's version of this ""tale as old as time"" dominates the story's place in popular culture, but the tale of a wild beast man and his human companion go back at least to Gilgamesh and Enkidu. It's what Cocteau does with this version that enables it to stand up to modern scrutiny and continue to enliven the imagination of viewers. This Criterion/Janus Films restoration presents the film in a manner that is cleaned up to look as it would have when the film print were new, yet it doesn't have that odd level of depth that many Blu-Ray transfers feature and which, with a film this old, make it unwatchable. The usual assortment of documentaries and the informational booklet make this a must-have for any cinephile.",1491868800,11,1322,4.828193832599119
30146,5,0780020715,"Saw this a long time ago. Still love it, even though it's black and white and in French. This is a unique interpretation of Beauty and the Beast that is worth a look to those who believe in the idea that someone could ever ""love a beast"".",1490918400,2,238,4.085106382978723
30147,4,0780020715,"Am I suffering from false memory syndrome?  I saw this film on the big screen when it was not many years old, and again on television when it was not much older.  I could have sworn that, on both occasions, there was a shot - stop-frame animation, obviously - of the Beast transforming into the Prince tuft by tuft of fur.  It was badly done - and indeed I also believe that I read somewhere that Cocteau realised as much and wished he could do it again.  (The reverse transformation - Avenant into Beast - is quite different.)  So did Cocteau take the shot out?  Or am I deluded?

30151,5,0780020715,"Among the many reasons to despair of humanity's future is the knowledge that this cinematic crown jewel has probably been seen by fewer people in the years since its creation than either of the kitschy Disney versions was in any one week of their release. Josette Day, Cocteau's Beauty, makes most of Hollywood's plastic actresses look like the dog's dinner by comparison (how she MOVES!), while Jean Marais' Beast brings a Shakespearean richness and depth to his character that is simply breathtaking -- so much so that, when Greta Garbo first saw the film, she turned to her companion after the transformation at the end and said ""Give me back my Beast"". The black-and-white cinematography is painterly in its use of light and shadow, as well as in its subtle variety of hues and tints, while the production designs look like something out of Gustave Dore's engravings. If dreams were coherent, this is what they would look and sound like.

I've watched this multiple times and haven't become tired of it yet. The only disappointment is the ending, but many others have already said what's wrong there.

Otherwise--I've loved this version of the story ever since seeing it for the first time back in the 80s after a fellow fan of the TV series told me about it.  Beautiful costumes and, for the time, state-of-the-art special effects enhance this timeless story of unconditional love and redemption.  This is one of the few black and white movies I've ever seen that I thought would be *enhanced* by a good colorization job, by which I mean NOT one of the more common ones where all the colors are variations on brown and blue.  I mean the kind where you can't tell that it wasn't originally filmed in color, like whatever company has handled the colorization on the Shirley Temple movies.  While it's fun to try to imagine the colors in the costumes--which, seriously, I think they spent most of their budget on--I would also love to see the colors.  Also, the moving arms holding candelabras, statues with moving heads and eyes that *literally* follow the actors around, etc. are simultaneously wondrous and creepy and add to the overall atmosphere of Beast's  magical/morose castle.

30159,5,0780020715,"In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too ""arty."" But, over the past three decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a monumentally higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.

Jean Cocteau took Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch candles, vocal household objects, jewelry which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around Belle's family, these serving to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.

This atmospheric film was given enormous lift by the wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role, personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles of the handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince, Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint. The women much preferred their kindly Beast.

30162,5,0780020715,If you are a big fan of classic movies then this one is for you. Responsible for popularizing the story of beauty and the beast this version has made some changes to the story. However you can see many elements from this film still being used today. It is a very well made film but it is also slowly paced with a very memorable ending. This might be the best movie  Jean Cocteau ever made and certainly deserved to be in the Criterion collection.,1471564800,7,446,4.309523809523809

30165,4,0780020715,"Odd, surreal, inventive, funny, maddening, romantic and silly...BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a viewing experience like no other.  It's also difficult to describe and I imagine each person seeing it will have different strong reactions to it.  But it SHOULD be seen by anyone with a love of film and of art.

It tells the basically familiar story of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (if you're a fan of the Disney movie, you can get a lot of amusement just looking for moments in this film that clearly inspired the animated version), but the whole approach is skewed and almost cartoonish.  It's as though the film is made with children in mind, yet as it goes along, it becomes more and more adult.  The lovely Belle in this telling is almost like Cinderella.  She cooks and cleans while her two sisters preen and order her about and are basically the step-sisters from CINDERELLA.  She also has a brother who is just a step above the village idiot, and there is his best friend, who has a pretty serious crush on Belle.  And then there is Belle's beloved father...he's in the import/export business, and his business is in ruins because all his ships have disappeared.  Frankly, Belle's father doesn't have many redeeming qualities, and it's hard to understand Belle's unthinking, unwavering devotion to him.  I know, I know...he's her father.  But she acts as though he is a saint.  He heads out on a business trip and on his return, stumbles across a mysterious estate in the middle of the forest.  And he basically breaks in, helps himself to food and pokes around the place like he owns it.  (Here is one of many examples where people in this film don't behave in believable ways.  Such is often the case in fairy tales when you think about them, but in a film, it just comes across as rude, if not criminal.  When dad takes a rose from a tree for his daughter...the Beast is so outraged, he makes an appearance.  He loves his roses above all else, and while he was seemingly content to see dad ransack his place, stealing a rose was an intolerable insult.

Dad only saves his own hide by promising to send his beloved daughter Belle to the Beast's estate in exchange.  Again, dad doesn't seem too honorable.  So Belle goes to live with the Beast, and the two slowly grow closer and closer, although Belle is still tormented by her longing to see her father, who has fallen ill.  The conversations between the two title characters are often odd.  Beast is clearly tormented, both by personal demons, but also be loneliness, which Belle has finally relieved somewhat.  Does he love her, or does he love the relief she brings?  She seems drawn to him too, yet often, she just wanders around the estate, looking frankly dazed and confused.  It's a difficult relationship to make sense of.  In fact, the motivations of most of the characters in the film are murky.

And yet, it all comes together in a dreamlike way.  The surface silliness and cartoonish behaviors somehow still gel into a compelling exploration of obsession and the way love can tear one between the urge to be selfish and the inspiration to be generous with the object of desire.  Beast wants Belle all for himself, yet he wants her to be happy, which means letting her return to her father.  Belle is torn between the lure of home, and her generosity of spirit when she sees how deeply Beast needs her.

All of this can be seen as romantic and lovely...the manifestations of deep love.  Yet there is a pretty deep sexual undercurrent that comes closer and closer to the surface as the film progresses.  What started out as a clownish story turns into barely restrained passions.  When Beast is clearly enthralled by Belle, he literally begins to smoke and he screams at her to close her bedroom door.  The implication is that he is moments away from loosing control of himself and attacking her.  A child watching this might think that she's in danger of being literally attached and eaten.  An adult viewer knows that's not exactly what we're talking about here.  And the looks Belle gives to the Beast show that she is more than passingly intrigued by the idea of being ravished.  Their relationship is ""wrong"" (in a conventional sense) and yet they have a burning desire (literally, in the Beast's case).

Also worth the price of admission is the spectacular estate of the Beast.  While there are few special effects as we would think of them, the film is full of magic.  Candlesticks are held literally by human hands.  Statues are alive.  The whole set is full of surprises, and the net effect is truly one of having created another world in the midst of our more conventional one.  Really cool stuff!

The ending of the film contains a remarkable, amusing twist and was just the final odd touch in an odd and strangely effective movie.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is rightfully a classic, and a very singular piece of cinema.

Criterion's blu-ray is full of interesting extras.  And if you like Philip Glass, you can listen to his score for the film instead of the original.  I tried it for awhile and found it too distracting, but others will certainly relish it.",1469923200,,5119,4.633333333333334

30193,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's  is the definitive film version of the Classic fair tale, an absolutely beautiful film!  Cocteau wanted to shoot in color -- thank goodness budget constraints prevented that!  Henri Alekan's black and white photography is superb.  It is a perfect example of collaboration in action as Cocteau was constantly after Alekan to shoot light for a stark, realistic almost documentary style, instead of the dreamy, glamour type that pervaded Alekan's instincts.  The result is actually a sort of mishmash of both styles, but cut together in such a way that it all actually works and works so well.  The good people at Criterion give to this set all the tender loving care that film lovers associate with the company.

30204,5,0780020715,"Shot over nine months starting from the end of World War II, in August 1945, Cocteau reinterpreted ""Beauty and the Beast""'s tale of Madame Leprince de Beaumont in one of the most impressive cinematographical poem in the history of cinema.

Accompanied by his friends  actors like Jean Marais and Marcel Andr, decorator Christian Brard, Marcel Escoffier as costume designer, and composer Georges Auric  Jean Cocteau introduced in his crew other admirable people. Talented artists such as Mila Parly and Nane Germon in the role of the sisters Felicia and Adelaide, Michel Auclair in the role of brother Ludovic, Doudou in the role of Diane and Josette Day in the role of Belle. Sublime discovery this actress is for her natural, pure and subtle acting skills make her the perfect actress for this role. Among the technical staff, Henri Alekan (cinematographer) and Ren Clment (assistant director) supported Cocteau. Especially Clement who directed sequences in the castle of the Beast while Cocteau was gravely ill at the Pasteur Institute. Detail Jean describes well in his film diary, which people can buy in bookshops or consult in libraries.

Far from telling the story that we already know, Cocteau takes the opportunity to enrich the mythology with very important antagonists like Ludovic, brother of Belle, Avenant, a friend whose love for Belle reveals him a very dangerous soul, and Diane Pavillon's, a magical section in the castle. Through these additions, Cocteau gave the story a greater dramatic tension that enriches the theme of appearance and beauty, but also an open ending that questions the film and some elements like the beast's nature, true intentions, double motives, and his universe. For in this tale are two dimensions. A real world similar to Vermeer paintings, with suffocating accessories and superficial frills. And the magical world of the Beast; whose subtle, frugal decorations, and clair-obscur lighting are reminiscent of Gustave Dor's engravings. Where the impossible becomes a theatre of surrealism.

Visually, the Blu-Ray version is impressive in HD , even if the image quality of the film, made on different types of film stocks, can be felt in certain sequences, which is what explains a bonus on the Restoration of the film. Indeed, as time went on, the film became damaged, resulting in noises, scratches and perforations that required several restorations sessions of the nitrates.

In its audio, the film offers an uncompressed Mono soundtrack, but also an HD recording of an opera by Philip Glass, who was inspired by Cocteau's film. As bonuses, other wonders are there too. Either the original trailers of the film that reference to sequences deleted in the film involving Belle, Adelaide, Ludovic, and Felicie. Comments of film historians, including a leaflet with Cocteau's message in regard to American audiences. But mostly an interview celebrating 50 years of the film, which took place in Rochecorbon with Henri Alekan, Mila Parly and Jean Marais, accompanied by Cocteau sound clips explaining his film.

As such, this film is fun for all movie lovers and fans of Cocteau who, under the HD treatment Criterion collection, can rediscover a classic under the HD splendor.",1427328000,4,3220,5.204633204633205

Magical things happen, there are beautiful people, beautifully dressed and photographed; there is a mysterious forest and garden, an even more mysterious castle.  My major reason for purchasing this movie, was to help with my French and here I wasn't disappointed; diction of all actors is a fabulously clear French and to my delight I understood almost everything' at least on second viewing.
Many of the imaginative bits are fabulous - I loved the candelabras held by living arms, which reminded me of the German word for those handy wall sconces 'Armleuchter'!.  (Arm light) - I loved beautiful and demure 'Beauty', hated her sisters, but I found the Beast irresistibly comical.  Reading the story of how the actor had to get into costume and remain in it often for a day, made one feel sorry for him, but his ability to express emotion is severely limited also by the elaborate costume he is wearing, which, again, makes him look awkward and comical.  I have watched this movie twice and that is enough - maybe I'll view it again at a later stage, mainly because it takes a great leap of faith to accept that 'Beauty' actually falls in love with this overdressed pussycat.
Having said that - and feeling bad about it -  I still believe that for the serious movie buff it is a must to have that Classic in his/her collection.",1417478400,,1511,4.640449438202247

As a magical tale, the burden was upon the film makers to make their effort truly magical - and they did a fascinating job. When the film was first released, the late-great, cinema star Greta Garbo remarked on the ending. When the Beast died and the Prince was restored to his rightful place, she cried out, ""Take away that candy-box prince and bring back my beautiful Beast!""

30250,5,0780020715,"Watching La belle et la bete the other day was a profoundly moving experience for me.  Beauty and the Beast has always been one of my favorite fairytales, and in many respects it has been my favorite.  I still remember the day that I saw the Disney film for the first time.  I was six years old and my whole family went to the theater together.  I was obsessed at a very young age with this timeless classic, and while my early years were consumed with Disneys presentation, I soon grew into exploring other facets of this tale.  From the stage play to the television series to variations of the book, I have loved everything I have been able to get my hands on.

But for some strange reason, I had not ever seen this critically acclaimed and beloved French adaptation, until now.

More so than just for myself, the magical moments contained in Jean Cocteaus magnificent film were shared with my daughters, and that made the experience all the more special.  The rich black and white, the inspired art direction and special effects and the beautiful chemistry between the actors all made for such a delightful movie watching experience, but as I read each word of dialog to my children (yes, I read every word) I could sense a swell of excitement come over the whole room, and when the Prince and Belle leap into the air in the rousing finale to fly off to their kingdom my eldest daughter stood up on the bed and yelled this is beautiful I knew that this would be one of my proudest cinematic moments as a father.

For those only familiar with Disneys version of the tale, many aspects of Cocteaus beautiful film will be brand new to the viewer.  This tale plays out vastly different, with Belles actual life feeling like a solid mixture of Disneys Belle and Cinderella.  Belle is made house servant by her spoiled sisters who treat her, and those around them, like dirt.  Belle has caught the eye of Avenant, a family friend and fellow scoundrel with her brother, Ludovic.  Their father is a man with financial woes, and her brother is a man with even more of them.  On a nightly trip home, Belles father stumbles upon the Beasts haunted lair and is condemned to death when he picks one of the Beasts beloved roses.  The Beast gives him an ultimatum.  If one of the mans children wants to come and die in his place, his life with be spared.  He is to return (or send one of his children) back in three days time.

Upon hearing her fathers heartbreaking tale, and taking responsibility, since it was for her that he picked the rose, Belle decides to venture off to the Beasts lair in her fathers place.

Here is where the film truly transforms into a visual and emotional spectacle.

The tale of the love that forms between the Beast and Belle is done in a much more reserved and innovative way in Cocteaus tale.  Instead of the lavish romanticism that we saw with Disney, Cocteau takes his time to develop something darker, earthier in tone.  That isn't to downgrade what Disney did with this story at all, for their adaptation is still one of my favorite animated films of all time and is a truly splendid counterpoint to this film, but the differences are obvious.  The approach made to the relationship that forms between the two is one more naturally and believably developed.  The Beasts yearning, his inner desperation and his ashamed demeanor are all brought magically to life through Jean Maraiss stunning performance; and considering that he really only had his eyes to work with is an astonishing feat.  Contrast that with the coolness that pervades Belles subtle acceptance of the Beast and the way that she always portrays the inner beauty of Belle without betraying her obvious fear and feeling of betrayal concerning her situation and you have a shockingly poignant character study that develops real themes of love and understanding, trapped within the beautiful surroundings of a fairytale.

This story is so universally loved because it is so universally profound.

From a visual standpoint, La belle et la bete is a stunning piece of cinema.  The rich black and white cinematography engulf every frame, creating a beautiful template for Cocteau to paint his picture.  The costumes and sets are all astonishing to see.  The way that Cocteau took his disadvantages (financially and technologically) and turned them into advantages is just brilliant.  The sets, those living breathing sets, are just breathtaking.

And the Beasts makeup is so real, so believable, that hell give you chills.

With a beautiful score by Georges Auric, who illuminates every scene with the musical progression, La belle et la bete stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of all time.",1400457600,,4701,4.728834355828221
30251,5,0780020715,"This is a beautiful film, with a magical, dream-like quality.  What I especially liked were the audio commentaries from two different filmmakers that added to my viewing experience.",1398038400,,181,5.464285714285714
30252,3,0780020715,"A beautiful film, of almost unmatched poetry and marvellous pictures, no question about that. Nevertheless: I saw it twice with a distance of ten years, and both times I was not convinced by the main theme - the love story. I cannot see or understand why these two are supposedly falling in love, Monsieur Cocteau, I'm sorry. The characters do not move me: the beast spies on the beauty in her room and tells her lies, the beauty is in love with the family friend Avenant, although as a viewer you see right away that he is reckless and cold. Also, I found the final explanation for the beast's curse far-fetched and implausible.

I guess what makes this film is not logic but the unique storytelling, all right. And I know that I am now probably earning the reputation of an ignorant who has no idea what good films are, but be that as it may, it's my personal point of view. To someone who wants to see an also, in its own way, beautifully told version of this fairy tale, where the characters are not cardboard cut-outs but original and their feelings for one another credible, I recommend the Disney version of the year 1990. And no, I didn't dislike this film because I am Disney biased, I had seen the Cocteau film version for the first time long before the Disney version came out.",1395964800,,1288,4.4576271186440675

There is wonderful cinematography needless to say, along with ingenious special effects -- a good number of which were accomplished by running the scenes in reverse. Add to this the outstanding make-up, costuming, sets, score, script, casting, and of course acting. The film has no weaknesses.

I picked up the Criterion Blu-ray on sale and I immediately fell in love with the movie. This movie is beautiful as the fairy tale itself. Art direction is amazing. The visual effects are equally amazing. If you think about the filming techniques back in 1946, your amazement will grow. The set decoration for the Beast's castle and the visual effects are simply magnificent. Beast's makeup is superb. And acting is just immaculate. I had never thought that I could be so much impressed by such an old movie (although I do have favorite movies as old as 1930s). The movie works at every level.

The special effects are amazing and wonderful for the times, I wish film makers wouldn't rely so much on CGI as they do these days, I think something has been lost since they do so heavily anymore, it takes way more talent and imagination to make special effects with real people and objects, and if the film makers still do it lame even with computers then they play on the novelty of 3d. The film is etheric, romantic, and magical. The only thing I don't like about this version is that the ending is a bit weak, it seems as though they couldn't quite figure out how to make it all make sense that Jean Marais played 2 roles in the film, and trying to explain why the prince looked like her hometown n'er do well love.  Other than that, I spent a lot of time searching for this film for my own collection after having seen it once, and was thrilled when it came out on dvd.

30296,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's La Belle et La Bete is on a lot of Best Movie lists, sometimes for snooty reasons.  After all, it's foreign (that'll get you 4 stars right there), it's French (there are a whole class of movie critics who like nothing but) - and it's relatively old (made after WWII), so it qualifies as a ""classic.""  But sweep aside all that pseudo-intellectual noise, and you're still left with a magnificent movie.

I discovered it accidentally.  Most of the people I grew up with, went to school with, worked with, never knew it existed - and if they had known, they might have thought it was dumb and boring because there weren't any car chases or explosions.  Plus you have to read subtitles - what a bummer!

But there are times in your life when you're ripe for magic.  I was fourteen, and I had my own (black & white) TV in my bedroom.  I loved that thing, because it showed me worlds far outside my little Phoenix suburb.  One night I was surfing (in this case, actually turning a dial), and I landed on our local PBS station.  I saw a beautiful woman entering what looked like a haunted castle.  Disembodied arms held candelabra in the entryway, and she glided along the hallway outside her bed chamber as if the floor were moving.  There was no sound, and when she turned to run from the castle, she moved in slow motion.  When she got to the courtyard, she was confronted by a magnificently dressed man with the head of a lion.  She fainted.  He picked her up and carried her back into the castle.

That was IT, my friends.  That scene was like an arrow to my heart.  No way was I going to touch that dial until the movie was over.  It replayed the next night, so I watched it from beginning to end.  No other attempt to film the story of Beauty And The Beast has even come close to it.  No other attempt ever will.  There are several reasons why.

Maybe the essential reason is Jean Cocteau.  He was like an author writing a book.  This makes sense when you consider that he was a novelist, painter, playwright, and poet, besides being a filmmaker.  Though he was a poet, he knew that pursuing poetry too enthusiastically can cause it to elude you completely.  And I suspect that the romance in La Belle et La Bete was more personal for Cocteau than it ever was for other directors who filmed the story of Beauty And The Beast.  Of all the characters in his film, the one he seemed to relate to the most was Belle, played by Josette Day.  In his book about making the movie, Diary Of A Film, Cocteau wrote a little note about Josette.  He said she looked like he had when he was younger.  When you consider that his lover and lifelong friend Jean Marais played both the Beast and the other man who loved Belle (Avenant), this little note takes on extra significance.

Considerable credit for the look of La Belle et La Bete belongs to Christian Berard, the art director, and Henri Alekan, the cinematographer (just two of the artists/technicians who deserve credit).  According to Cocteau's own diary, he did not always agree with his team, and often felt frustrated with them.  Yet he persevered in his collaboration with them.  The production was an expensive challenge, he really had to improvise to get supplies, line up shooting locations, design special effects.  And, though it may seem like filming the production in black & white was an artistic choice, he indicates in Diary of a Film that he would have preferred color - it just wasn't an option in postwar France.  It's hard to say what that color production would have looked like - the black & white turned out gorgeous.

The acting is superb.  And the folktale was originally adapted for print by two Frenchwomen, so perhaps Cocteau was sensitive to what was between the lines.  But two things that really make the movie stand head and shoulders (and mane?) above other versions are the ""creature"" design for the Beast and the beautiful score by Georges Auric.  The Beast was so splendid in his velvet outfit and starched collar, so perfect as a lion, it makes you sad when he eventually metamorphoses into a man at the end.  This outcome is not helped by the fact that Jean Marais is wearing those silly pantaloons that look like the little tents that go on the end of Thanksgiving drumsticks.  Legend has it that Marlene Dietrich, after witnessing this transformation during a screening of the film in Paris, asked, ""Where is my beautiful Beast?""  I'm inclined to agree.

Georges Auric's score is also on my list of top ten scores.  I love it from beginning to end, but one segment haunts me - the scene where Belle and the Beast walk together in the garden for the first time.  There's something timeless and magnificent about that scene - I think it's the heart of the movie.

Great books, music, and movies are made by brilliant people who are unique because they are a product of their particular place and time.  That's why other attempts to reproduce what they've done are unsuccessful.  No one will ever write a fantasy like The Lord Of The Rings, because Tolkien was a British man who was born in South Africa near the end of the 19th century, emigrated to England, and eventually served in the trenches of World War I.  Likewise, Cocteau and his team of filmmakers had their unique experiences and vision (not to mention their own Great War).  The result of their collaboration is a movie that will be loved as long as people are still watching movies.  It's magic truly is timeless.",1342483200,5,5471,4.535240040858018
30297,5,0780020715,"If there's one film that exemplifies the true essence of a fairy tale, Jean Cocteau's 1946 masterpiece, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, is that film. The concept of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is as old as fiction, and while the story's ancient origins are unknown, Cocteau's film is more or less a faithful adaptation of its most popular, 18th century incarnation.

Although the cutesy Disney animated feature is more famous, this French cinematic classic easily surpasses that version in...well...everything. By utilizing his unique visionary skill, Cocteau creates a hauntingly romantic, magical world that gives the effect of being awake in a dream. This is achieved through Henri Alekan's atmospheric photography, Christian Berard's ornate production design, Marcel Escoffier and Antonio Castillo's sumptuous, period costumes, and Georges Auric's magnificent music score. Jean Marais (in a great make-up job) and lovely Josette Day give poetic performances in the lead roles, with Marais also playing Beauty's handsome but greedy lover. Everything is weaved together by Cocteau's imaginative genius.

The latest Blu-ray of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST from Criterion does ample justice to this exqusite film, restoring its beauty to the fullest degree. There's lots of enjoyable extras by way of two commentaries, a making of documentary, an interview with cinematographer Henri Alekan, a featurette on the film's restoration, the original trailer, and a plethora of production stills. There's also an alternate Philip Glass opera audio track which I frankly have no use for. I'm perfectly happy with the soundtrack that belongs with the film, thank you.

 I heartily give this excellent edition my highest recommendation.",1341100800,6,1704,5.542307692307692

might interest me.  Beauty was one of them.  I noticed it was now a Criterion
restoration in Blu-ray, and I had just received the Criterion Blu-ray restoration

not disappoint.  It's hauntingly beautiful and so much of it is so unexpected.
By the way, I've been buying DVDs from Amazon for years since they have the best
prices and are totally reliable.  Now if only Criterion would come out with a
Blu-ray of the greatest film ever made - David Lean's incredible epic, Lawrence
of Arabia - I'd be a happy guy.  The Japanese(SONY) own the rights to Lawrence after
they bought Columbia Pictures and I believe they don't want any competition to
their Japanese directors.",1331769600,2,912,4.770700636942675
30299,5,0780020715,"Glass's opera, La Belle et la Bte, was composed to be listened to while watching the 1946 movie by Jean Cocteau, and everyone who likes the music of Phillip Glass should listen to it at least once that way.  I bought the CD when it came out and have listened to it many times.  It is a good sounding CD, but it is a CD, with the deficiencies that implies.  The Criterion DVD has a 5.1 surround mix of the recording but it also has DVD quality sound which is basically 5.1 channel mp3.  But now there is a Blu-ray version from Criterion with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround version and that soundtrack has much warmth, richness, and fullness that is lacking in other versions.  It is now the best way to listen to this music.  You don't have to watch the movie every time.  But you can turn on the picture long enough to select the Glass soundtrack and press start and then turn off the picture if you don't want it.

I highly recommend the Blu-ray version.  The sound is good enough that I am sure that the original master tapes must be recorded at something a bit higher in resolution than the 44.1/16 CD standard even if it wasn't recorded at 96/24.  Was it 96/24 originally?  I don't know, probably not; but many recordings were recorded at higher bit and sampling rates by 1994 when this music was originally recorded.

You can also watch the movie with the original soundtrack music by Georges Auric, in a high resolution uncompressed transfer of the original mono soundtrack, if you wish to see it as originally presented.  And the picture quality is excellent, probably the best it has been seen in 50 or 60 years.  If you like either the original movie or Phillip Glass, you can't go wrong with the Blu-ray, unless you don't have a Blu-ray player, yet.",1326067200,9,1763,4.451713395638629

30303,5,0780020715,"Beauty and the Beast is a magical, sublime film with universal themes of love, desire, fear and agony. Jean Cocteau created a magical film full of surreal environments. The characters are wonderful and the relationship between Belle and the Beast is glourious to look at. When you enter the Beast castle is like you are entering a wonderful dream. The special effects of the film are amazingly done and are even more spectacular when you consider that there were no computers at that time.

The transformation of the Beast into the prince is magical but also dissapointing. The beast shows more human emotions that any of the human characters in the film which are selfish, greedy and spoiled (with the exception of Belle). With this transformation, we can't help but wonder if just the outside change or the inside too. We are like Belle thrilled to see the Beast as human but also a little bit dissapointed that the magic is gone.

Cocteau created a wonderful masterpiece which themes still resounds today and the story still fills us with joy and magic.

Video & Audio
Criterion has done a great job with this film. Due to its age and inherent limitations there are some signs of softness, damage and transition issues. Still, the picture has never look better with corrected color, sharp contrast and great detail. This is easily the best presentation of the film.

The uncompressed monoaural soundtrack is superb with added clarity and no damage. Even more impressive is the Philio Glass Opera score now remixed in 5.1 DTS-HD MA which sound absolutely terrific.

Bonus Features:
You have plenty of bonus material on this disc. First you have two great audio commentaries, one by Arthur Knight and the other by Sir Christopher Frayling. They discuss the making of the film, its legacy and importance in film history. Then you have a making-of documentary ""Screening at the Majestic"" which taks about how the film was made. Then you have an interview with the film's cinematographer Henri Alekan and also a 1964 interview with the film's make up artist Hagop Arakelian. You also have a restoration demonstration, a theatrical trailer, a restoration trailer and a gallery.

A booklet is also included with essays by film scholars, Cocteau himself and Philip Glass.

30306,5,0780020715,"This is one of ten of my reviews where I analyze different versions of Beauty and the Beast. See the first review of this series - Beauty and the Beast by Unknown - which discusses this genre and outlines the purpose of the fable. This 1945 French film with English subtitles is considered a classic. It was done just after World War II. It is supposedly based on the de Beaumont version of the tale, but is markedly different. This one has additional characters, a different ending, and focuses on desire, enchantment, and death. It also has lots of humor. The 93 minute black and white DVD is accompanied by discussions about the tale. Two main characters, not in the de Beaumont version, are Beauty's brother and a suitor, a friend of her brother. Much time is also spent on various kinds of magical happenings at Beast's castle, such as disembodied hands holding candles and serving food, and talking doors.

As in the de Beaumont account, when Beauty returns late, after visiting her parents, she finds Beast lying on the ground almost dead from grief. Beauty's brother and her suitor, sneak into Beast's castle to steal his treasure. When the suitor enters the vault, and this may be the crucial point of this version, a statute of Cupid shoots him with an arrow. He falls dead and is transformed into the Beast. At the same moment, the Beast turns into a prince, and this prince is Beauty's former suitor. How should we interpret this ending?

It is possible that this story is an allegory of the difficulties faced by young girls. The Beast and the suitor is the same person. Beauty, a virgin, is courted by a handsome man but is afraid of what will happen in her marriage and refuses to accept him. She sees him as a beast. However, after seeing how well he treats her, she (not he) is struck by Cupid's arrow, sees him now for what he really is, and agrees to live happily ever after with him.",1310428800,2,1903,4.545189504373178

It is a classic and similar in charm to The Wizard of Oz. It is in French and also black & white which both contribute to its uniqueness & obscurity. Nonetheless this is an excellent version of the timeless fairy tale that continues to live on strong.

However, it's viewing BB as a Philip Glass opera that really ups the ante. Glass music can seem to be repetitious, although this was never a problem for me. Rather, it's always a worthwhile challenge to dissect the variations and development within his music. For BB, Glass has created a much less repetitious score that plays with, supports and expands the visual and narrative drama. The result is, I believe, an unusually beautiful work of art.

The extras help to appreciate the work that was involved in the restoration and the creation of the opera. Of great interest are the interviews of the actors/producers of the original film. This is a really special DVD.",1305676800,,846,4.868055555555555

  after having seen the Cocteau film after some twenty years, i couldn't believe how beautiful it was in comparison. it makes the Disney version seem shallow and trite. as a matter of fact, after seeing this Cocteau's version i don't think i could ever go back to the Disney version and be satisfied with it. in comparison, Disney's version seems like such commercial junk.
  critics always play up the sophistication and artistic side of Cocteau's film. it is high art no doubt. it is also a very enchanting and charming children's film with the same inoccent child like fantasy of the original 'Wizard of Oz' film or Walter Lang's 'The Bluebird'.
  even though it is in old time black & white, the film is far better and more intelligent than the Disney film. children brought up on Cocteau's film will probably turn out a little bit more thoughtful and smarter than with the Disney tripe. at least they won't have a bunch of cutesy, Disney songs droning through their heads afterwards.

30312,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE remains one of the benchmark masterpieces in cinema history. Filled with fascinating camera tricks and exquisite performances, it's a magical movie for all ages.

Based on the immortal fairytale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, the story plays out more or less in the way most people are familiar with. The selfless Belle (Josette Day) agrees to live in the castle of a hideous Beast (Jean Marais) after her father steals a white rose from his enchanted garden. The Beast's only request is to watch her nightly during dinner; Belle is given all the freedom she wishes, yet she may never step beyond the palace borders. When Belle is granted the chance to visit her sick father, the Beast gives her the key to his vault of riches as a token of his trust that she'll return. When her siblings discover the key, they steal it away for their own selfish ends. Belle returns just as the Beast is in his death throes, finally realising how much she loves him.

LA BELLE ET LA BETE should be compulsive viewing for any serious movie fan; lovers of fairytale cinema will adore it too. Josette Day is just like a porcelain doll come to life, impossibly beautiful with a mane of long blonde hair and costumed in some of the most ornate and beautiful gowns. Jean Marais handles the role of the Beast well (and also gets to play Belle's unwanted admirer Avenant). The film also features well-judged performances from Mila Parely, Nane Germon, Michel Auclair, and Marcel Andre.

Jean Cocteau's inspired vision was later the basis for the ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" version starring Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski; the 1990 animated Disney musical also adopted some of the thematic elements (particularly the 'Enchanted Objects'). They all pale beside the true classic...LA BELLE ET LA BETE.",1290902400,,1813,4.841935483870968
30313,5,0780020715,"Long before Disney ever got their grubby paws on it, Jean Cocteau made the ultimate adaptation of the classic French fairy tale ""The Beauty and the Beast."" And it was... well, magical. Cocteau's direction turned this simple story into a dreamy haze of haunting images, lush sets and luminous beauty, from the beginning to the eerie end.

The titiular beauty, Belle (Josette Day), works like a dog for her ne'er-do-well brother Ludovic and her snotty sisters. When their father was going home through the forest, he stumbles across an enchanted castle ruled by a cruel Beast (Jean Marais). When the father thoughtlessly plucks a single rose, the Beast gives him a choice -- he can die, or he can send one of his daughters.

Of course, Bella goes straight to the castle, and finds herself in a new world of magic, mystery and enchantment. She also begins falling in love with the Beast, despite his leonine appearance. But when she returns home for a visit, her siblings and her nasty suitor Avenant begin plotting to kill the Beast and destroy the life Belle has been given.

Floating candles, stone hands and faces that move, glittering jewels, magical mirrors, living statues, and a exquisitely sylvan palace filled with mist and light. This is a really haunting, beautiful movie that doesn't spare any visual impact that it can make -- and that quality makes the entire film feel like a delirious dream that you never want to wake up from.

Jean Cocteau's direction really elevates this simple story into a piece of art, especially since he makes such careful use of light, which makes everything in the castle look luminous. And he inserts many striking scenes, such as Belle and the Beast's wanderings in a sea of statues, and when he drinks water out of her hands, or when she sees him approaching from behind in a mirror.

Day is really astounding as Belle -- she's very sweet, kind of a doormat, and really seems like a girl who is too nice for her own good. Marais does a remarkably good job emoting with his eyes and voice, especially since the poor man could barely move his face -- when the camera zooms in on his eyes, you can see the smoldering emotions.

Jean Cocteau's exquisite ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a glimmering jewel in classic movies -- lusciously detailed, painfully lovely, and directed with great care. A must see for any cinephile.",1288137600,4,2358,4.7250608272506085

Major aspects are in rarely balanced contrasting pairs. The overall dual setting of a nearly grimly real late Medieval France urban household -- with a bankrupt merchant father about to be totally stripped of posessions and dignity -- is in very effective contrast with ""The Beast"" [La Bete] residing in an ""Otherworld"" forest chateau -- reached by various surreal routes from the ""Real World"". Other main aspects of this movie are in similar pairs of real versus surreal and dark versus fair -- in complete harmony of the overall theme of ""Beauty and the Beast"". Dark versus fair shades are used for effective contrast as well as murky versus clear, rough versus slick and lower versus upper perspectives -- and all of that is just some of the visual effectiveness of the presentation. The actors and acting are in great finesse in their balanced movement, evocation, dialog and timing -- minor and major moods are done spot-on. Also -- without anything remotely like current special effects -- supreme usage is made of imaginative creative classical effects [circa 1946] -- such as isolated heads with exactly surreal smoothly tracking faces and eyes and mobile arms with gripping hands holding candelabras or various utensils. In a like manner trees, plants, doors and drapes are in animated movement in sync with the drama and persons [including ""The Beast""]. I especially appreciate Josette Day as La Belle [""The Beauty""]. I am glad this Great Classic movie haunted my memory from a long ago school movie appreciation class.

30323,5,0780020715,"For many people the days, the mention of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is something animated by Disney or a TV series from the 1990's but the story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was born as a fairy tale back in the 1740's by Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and then revised in 1757 by French novelist Jeanne Marie Le Prince de Beaumont.

But in 1946, director Jean Cocteau (""The Testament of Orpheus"", ""Orpheus"", ""Kes Enfants Terribles"") would take the popular story and adapt it into a live action film known as ""La belle et la bete"" (Beauty and the Beast) featuring cinematography by Henri Alekan and music by Georges Auric.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to note that ""Beauty and the Beast"" was among the first DVD's released by the Criterion Collection back in 1998.  Around 2003, several of their earlier titles received a re-release including a high-definition digital transfer and more special features.

For ""Beauty and the Beast"", with the celebration of 100 years in French Cinema, the Centre National de l'audiovisuel of Luxembourg in association with the CLT-UFA International began their restoration on ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The restoration began with the original nitrate negative which suffered from age-related deterioration.  The negative was cleaned and many of its sprocket holes repaired, so the negative would roll evenly through the gate at 24 frames per second.  A wet-gate process was then used to fill in the scratches and removal of any fine dust.  The restorers then made fine-grain positive elements that became the main source for the new restoration negative.

""Beauty and the Beast"" is presented in 1:33:1 and the new digital transfer was created from the 35mm restoration duplicate negative on a high-definition Spirit Datacine.  The MTI Digital Restoration System removed thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.

The picture quality of ""Beauty and the Beast"" looks very good for a film that is over 60-years-old.  Blacks are nice and deep and grays and white also look great.  Granted, it's not a pristine transfer as their is dust and scratches that can be seen but for the most part, the restoration makes it much better looking than any previous release of the film.  But most important about the film was its technical creativity.  From its surreal and fantasy look, especially the use of slow motion, ""Beauty and the Beast"" manages to create the magical/fantasy world.

As for the audio, the audio is monaural and was created from an optical soundtrack print and restored at 24-bit using digital audio tools to reduce ticks, pops, hiss and other distortions.  Audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 but I preferred to hear the track coming on all channels via a selection on my home theater receiver for a more pronounced soundscape for the film's audio.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A masterpiece from Poet-Playwright Jean Cocteau,  ""Beauty and the Beast"" (La belle et la bete) is definitely one of his most inspired films to help define French cinema at that time.  Sure, we have seen Hollywood create a magical world and characters with ""Wizard of Oz"" in 1936 but ""Beauty and the Beast"" is like a painting on a canvas.

Each scene, especially in the magical castle and world of the beast is captured in such beauty with its cinematography especially when Belle enters the castle for the first time and the use of slow motion, to the visual/dark surroundings of the statues that move, the hands and arms extending out to hold a candle or a drink. Production and set design were just as beautiful.  May it be the elaborate look of the home, from its curtains to its silver.  The beast's palace is just brimming of upper class merchandise but a lonely, dark setting that he can't even enjoy.

This film is not a happy film like its Disney counterpart.  I'm not quite sure if this film was adored by children back then but I can probably guess that children were more than likely scared of the film as the imagery shows a beast, with this raspy voice that will easy scare you or annoy you (ala the supercomputer in Jean-Luc Godard's ""Alphaville""). But nevertheless, actor Jean Marais has done a good job playing the beast, while main actress, Josette Day as Belle, what a beautiful young maiden did a very good job and made us believe in her fear but her growing compassion towards the beast.

Fascinating and visually creative for its time, ""Beauty and the Beast"" from the Criterion Collection (the 2003 re-release) is a wonderful celebration for Cocteau's film.  Overall, ""Beauty and the Beast"" (Le Belle et La Bete) is definitely recommended!",1267488000,3,7005,4.988793103448276
30324,5,0780020715,"There is a saying about some of the greatest filmmakers of all time... The have childlike tendencies... This movie may prove this saying correct. Jean Cocteau has made a movie more thrilling, and as much as fantastical as those of the great German silent era. He pulls from the depths of his soul, all that we are taught as children and hold so dear to the day we die, having passed it on to our children and theirs... that there is beauty, there are beasts, there is darkness but in that darkness lies a light that can never be lost. The light of beautiful days, we remember in our darkests.

La Belle at a Bete blows open the imagination of everyone who watches it. After first viewing this with my brother, we were so amazed. It opened those locked doors of my imagination and drove me wild with the passion to write beautiful pieces of works. It showed how painting with light is really done, producing some of the most visually succulent images... It also showed me how to be funny, as the two sisters, brother and Belles admirer provide a type of comic relief to this very heavy, emotionally charged film. It balances wonderfully... One of the greatest French films ever made. Every child and adult should share this experience toghether. Enjoy!",1267228800,,1251,4.609865470852018

The costuming is so elaborate (even if it is in black & white), and the main characters (most especially the Beast) are so full of emotion and vulnerability that you literally feel their pain.  In fact, I was kind of disappointed in the end when the Beast transformed into the Prince, as I'd fallen in love with the creature just as Belle had!

The special effects are rather fascinating, as well.  The Beast literally smokes after a hunt, the enchanted servants appear as moving statues or arms either holding candelabras or pouring out wine in the Great Hall.

I highly recommend this film to anyone.",1259971200,3,665,4.747826086956522
30330,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau was the lead artistic director in French cinema.  This is a revered, beloved film of his.  It is a classic retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale yet also is surreal with Dali-like sets and props and an Art Deco look and feel to it. Cocteau cast his own long time lover, Jean Marais, as the beast. Marais is a good looking man but, ironically, he is so great as the beast that it is a bit disappointing when he becomes his classically handsome self at the film's end.

The plot is that La Belle's (Beauty's) father steals a rose from La Bte (the Beast) and he must surrender his daughter to La Bte in order to remain alive. Belle moves into the La Bte's exquisite Art Deco like mansion with all its perfect accoutrements and gardens. She doesn't realize it but it is her love that can restore La Bte from his present form to his former Prince Charming handsomeness.

Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont wrote the original fairy tale and Jean Cocteau wrote the screenplay adaptation with all of its artistic, visual and surreal influences.

On his way back from the city he must go through a mysterious forest in the evening. He stumbles upon an enchanted abode. There he is offered food and drink. On his exit the next morning he pilfers a prize rose to fulfill his daughters wish. Now he is confronted by the home owner La Bte (Jean Marais). For his indiscretion he is given the choice of giving up his life or that of his daughter.  He returns home to tell the tale.

The story first written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont is adapted by Jean Cocteau to film, also directed by Jean Cocteau.

I could expound on the great visual effects and dialog choices. But it is much better described by the voice over track on the Criterion version. You will be enchanted by this version and will come to make this your favorite.

30332,5,0780020715,"This movie is pure magic, in the best sense of the word and one never tires of seeing it, as it is always fresh in its own space and time. I have seen it since childhood, at least 10 times, and there was not one time I did not enjoy it as much as if it were the first. This unique quality has guaranteed it a cult status amongst film aficionados.
From the point that Belle's father is lost in a storm and finds his way to the Beast's chateau, the movie takes off into a magic realm, where trees part to let guests through (as they do for the Prince Charming in Sleeping Beauty) and a hallway can be lit by magical hands holding candlesticks that never go off no matter how windy. Other magical hands can assist while eating at a beautiful dining table while mantlepiece statues become animated and look on mysteriously.
Belle's father has ventured there on his way back from a business trip and Belle had asked him to bring back a rose. Her mean and envious, snobby sisters have asked for more exotic presents, as they resemble Cinderella's sisters in their meanness to Belle, but in a way are also closely related to Moliere's ""Precieuses Ridicules' : the women of his time that took refinement so seriously that they made a ridiculous spectacle of themselves. However it is this rose that will connect Belle to the Beast as her father incurrs the Beast's wrath when he takes the flower and he has to swear to come back, or send one of his daughters in his place. Even while the Beast is finishing the sentence we KNOW Belle will show up in his place.
The Beast in this movie is Jean Marais, and the Belle is Josette Day, both excellently directed by Jean Cocteau, the ultimate magician, I believe of all his works, whether literary or otherwise, this was the masterpiece. Cocteau creates a world historically set at the beginning of the 17th century in France, but more akin to the ""Once upon a time"" era of fairy tales and stories that children have always loved. The ability to ground the fantasy of the tale within the context of the eternal archetypes (as in Jung)  is what makes the story so appealing and everlasting.
The Beauty inside the beast is what attracts Belle, and eventually makes her love him. She is naturally beautiful inside out and even when she is doing house chores she has the air of having just had a facial at a La Prairie Spa. One can understand her attraction for the beast, as no matter how ugly he looks, the Beast is impeccably dressed in velvet and diamond embroideries that look like early Yves Saint Laurent couture, not to mention that he dresses her magically also, while he carries her through a doorway, in a ravishing gown that would make any girl lose her mind with delight, and showers her with magnificent gifts such as diamond tears that pay all her father's debts and an exquisite necklace fit for a queen. Once Belle's love is declared to the dying Beast, which is a very dramatic scene, as the beast is dying of sadness over not seeing her (how fabulous a disease is that?? we don't even have a name for it) he can be born again in the guise of Belle's admirer, a role also played by Marais as  a handsome but brainless young man. He only makes sense up to the point where he metamorphoses from the body of the Beast at the same instant, and in perfect synchronicity  in time, that the young man has climbed into the forbidden pavillion of Diana, where all of the Beast's treasury is scattered, and where he has come with the ambition of killing the beast and stealing the treasure. Instead he is killed by an arrow from a statue of the goddess that has become magically animated. Belle then ""remembers' vaguely that she knew and liked someone that ""looked like him"" which makes the Beast-turned-Jean-Marais give a radiant smile of self satisfaction and we know we've hit the finale on a high note.
It is a beautiful romance in the gorgeous setting of an enchanted castle and a happy ending that ends quite literally with the two lovers flying to the heavens, giving ""Happily Ever After"" a visual image that is as unforgettable as the film itself.

It's a rather fast paced movie, especially re:  the relationship between Belle & the Beast.  I would have preferred seeing some more interaction/ conversations between the two of them.

30340,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau was one of France's greatest poets, but he also made some magnficent films.  He only helmed 5 films (maybe 6) as director, but everyone bore his unmistakeable stamp.  This is one of his greatest films.

It simply retells a fairy tale that we are all familiar with.  We know how it ends, we know how it begins, yet, everytime you see this film, it feels fresh, beautiful, and awe inspiring.  It's shot in simple black and white film (stunningly so by Henri Alekan, who also shot the original Wings of Desire years later), has no overbearing songs, no cutesy ""comic relief"" elements, yet Cocteau manages to make this fairy tale seem like it was written yesterday.  It is the work of a remarkable man/artist that can take something so well known and make it feel alive again.  Cocteau does that here.

One of my favorite scenes is the ending.  We all know how the film ends, but when the Beast turns into the man, Cocteau uses his simple camera trick of running the film backward, making it look like Jean Marais leaps up (when the reality is he fell down and Cocteau just reversed the projection).  You know it's not realistic, yet it's so beautiful and feels more real than reality.  Is that art?  I believe it to be so.

This was one of Criterion's first DVD's, and they recently reissued it with a better restoration (thought the first DVD was quite good), and also included is Philip Glass's opera based on this film.  I have the first DVD edition, and Glass's score as well.  I would recommend all of Cocteau's films.  They're all so beautiful.",1207612800,6,1560,4.557553956834532

Beyond that is the level of acting and directing that you wouldn't expect in a ""dress-up"" production.  Everything is superb and that includes the emotions that you catch yourself reliving days later.

Words do not do this movie justice.  Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" needs to be experienced for the event and adventure that it is, but for the beauty and tenderness, as well.  It envelopes you like a cloud and long after it is over you are still feeling it.  There are scenes between
Beauty and the Beast that are so tender that you ache.  There are other scenes that are so ripe with sexual tension that you expect the Beast to come roaring out.  There is blood, anger bordering on violence and fear on both sides.  This is not your kiddie matinee.

This movie is absolutely sublime. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. Jean Marais, playing three roles, the beast/the prince/ Avenat (Beauty's suitor) is so amazing, you have to read the credits to realize that it is the same actor, his performance is almost pulling on Freud's personality theory. Josette Day, is in addition to being beautiful, plays Beauty perfectly. She is the one who navigates between the world of her family and the Beast's castle, well done.

I love that is in black and white, I think color would ruin the movie completely. It's a very subtle movie, full of metaphors that can only be discovered upon multiple viewings.  The morality tale is there, as it is the most faithful to the author's vision, but it is build upon, that is goes beyond a simple fairy tale.

30348,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE remains one of the benchmark masterpieces in cinema history.  Filled with fascinating camera tricks and exquisite performances, it's a magical movie for all ages.

Based on the immortal fairytale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, the story plays out more or less in the way most people are familiar with.  The selfless Belle (Josette Day) agrees to live in the castle of a hideous Beast (Jean Marais) after her father steals a white rose from his enchanted garden.  The Beast's only request is to watch her nightly during dinner; Belle is given all the freedom she wishes, yet she may never step beyond the palace borders.  When Belle is granted the chance to visit her sick father, the Beast gives her the key to his vault of riches as a token of his trust that she'll return.  When her siblings discover the key, they steal it away for their own selfish ends.  Belle returns just as the Beast is in his death throes, finally realising how much she loves him.

LA BELLE ET LA BETE should be compulsive viewing for any serious movie fan; lovers of fairytale cinema will adore it too.  Josette Day is just like a porcelain doll come to life, impossibly beautiful with a mane of long blonde hair and costumed in some of the most ornate and beautiful gowns.  Jean Marais handles the role of the Beast well (and also gets to play Belle's unwanted admirer Avenant).  The film also features well-judged performances from Mila Parely, Nane Germon, Michel Auclair, and Marcel Andre.

Jean Cocteau's inspired vision was later the basis for the ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" version starring Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski; the 1990 animated Disney musical also adopted some of the thematic elements (particularly the 'Enchanted Objects').  They all pale beside the true classic...LA BELLE ET LA BETE.",1187740800,,1823,4.841935483870968
30349,5,0780020715,"The premise of this French fairy tale will be familiar to anyone who's seen the wildly successful and (on its own terms) worthy Disney feature, but this original version by director Jean Cocteau is a more subtle, bewitching and artful rendering of the story.

The result is a work of genius, a stunning and surreal masterpiece sure to captivate the child in us all.",1182384000,,472,4.987341772151899

30351,4,0780020715,"About one half hour into Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la Bete (Beauty and the Beast), the Beast (King Kong by way of Gustave Dore) reassures his captive Belle (Josette Day) that ""there is no master here but you."" It strikes us as a strange bit of logic, given that she was forced to come to this place and does not stay of her own will. The Beast wishes only to meet every evening at seven, if only to gaze upon her as she eats. It's not as overtly kinky as watching her put on nylons or some other traditional fetish, but it works for the Beast so I won't judge.

At one point later in the film, Belle allows the Beast to drink from her hands. ""It doesn't repulse you?"" the Beast asks. ""No, Beast, I like it,"" and we imagine so does he. She later comforts him by running a hand through his fur. ""You stroke me as one does an animal."" Belle does not understand. ""But you are an animal."" It's so easy to forget sometimes, and the Beast has Belle to remind him. When he awakens her in the middle of the night, disheveled and stinking of deer blood, he can barely look at her. ""Forgive me...for being a beast"" he says with embarrassment. Belle is enraged. ""These words are not worthy of you. Aren't you ashamed?"" It's as though she caught him masturbating to the Victoria's Secret catalog. She tosses a shawl in his direction. ""Go clean yourself up and go to bed.""

Then the Beast puts on a leather mask with a zipper where the mouth should be and Belle makes him lick the pointy heel of her 9-inch stiletto boot.

Okay, that last part didn't happen. It's not that kind of movie... or is it? Not on the face of it, perhaps, but sexual and overtly Freudian undertones float throughout La Belle et la Bete as icebergs in an ocean, occasionally protruding the surface like, well, protuberances. At heart, what we have is a love story between a beautiful woman and a monstrous part-lion, part-man creature. Belle, the Cinderella-esque sibling of two spoiled sisters, becomes hostage to the Beast after her father unwittingly steals a rose from him. It doesn't make much sense, and it's not supposed to: the picture is surrealist in its truest sense, governed by dream logic. Like her paramour Avenant, the Beast asks for her hand in marriage and he is likewise rejected (both Beast and Avenant are played by the same actor, Jean Marais). True to her Electra complex, Belle claims she cannot abandon her father - indeed, she only leaves him (to live with the Beast) when by doing so saves his life.

As directed by Cocteau, Belle's entrance to the Beast's magical abode is really a thing of beauty (some of the French director's techniques would be appropriated, most notably, by Spike Lee and David Lynch). Traditional natural laws do not apply - she roams the hallways as though swimming in water. Belle doesn't walk, she glides through this Freudian playground of dream symbols: human arms hold up candelabras, statues open and close their eyes, always watching. Like much of her new home, the bed is organic, a living thing. When she first lays eyes on it, the furry comforter peels back, inviting her in. It's both erotic and terrifying (like most everything having to do with the Beast). Belle faints, overcome.

Love doesn't bloom between Beauty and Beast so much as Stockholm Syndrome-level sympathy for one's own captor/gimp. ""Love can turn a man into a beast,"" Belle says. ""But love can also make an ugly one handsome."" Quite literally, in the case of Belle's ferine co-star (as those familiar with the fairy tale will know), but I wonder how much Cocteau truly believes it. We tend to think we are separate from our bodies, as though the interior and exterior selves are independent. But they are not. We are our bodies, and when the Beast ceases to have his, shed like a snake his skin, he ceases to be himself.

Interesting footnote: Jean Marais plays three roles in La Belle et la Bete, including the handsome Prince that Belle ultimately flies off with. In life, he played the role of Jean Cocteau's long time male lover (the director was openly homosexual). Marais would go on to star in a number of Cocteau's future films, including L'Aigle a deux tetes and Les parents terribles.",1168992000,11,4187,4.590909090909091
30352,5,0780020715,"The first third of La Belle et La Bete maY seem a little too long and a little too slow, but the film still has the power to cast its spell over an audience. At times, perhaps from a modern viewer's perspective, you find yourself admiring the technique a little more than its soul, and Jean Marais' performance as the Beast strangely pales compared to his two-faced suitor, but then he was never exactly a great actor. Yet the complexity that Cocteau manages to bring to the film is still surprising, with neither the brother nor suitor descending to the easy caricature of the two ugly sisters: the former knows he and his sisters are wastrels, but that doesn't make him less of a liability, while the latter is almost in denial of his own nature. But ultimately it's the magical design that seduces, a fairytale kingdom smack in the middle of a believable world, but neither necessarily a benign one.

The movie is absolutely stunning to look at.  The actor's portrayals are amazing.  And the sets and ""special effects"" are miraculous for a movie filmed in the 1940's.  I admit I am a lover of fairy/folk tales and the story of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a particular favorite of mine.  I urge all other lovers of ""once upon a time"" stories to watch this gem.",1165017600,8,712,4.315789473684211
30354,5,0780020715,"The tale of Beauty and The Beast has been told in various forms for thousands of years. In cinema we have adaptations in King Kong(1933); Frankenstein(1931); Jekyl And Hyde(1932); The Phantom of the Opera(1925); The Hunchback of Notre Dame(1939); Creature From The Black Lagoon(1954) and more recently Edward Scissorhands(1990) and Shrek(2001). The tale will continue to spawn new adaptations but for me there is only one version, Jean Cocteau's `La Belle et La Bete'(1946).

La Belle et La Bete is adapted from the abridged version of the fairy tale by Madame Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The story is interpreted as a young woman's coming of age tale with sexual desire being regarded as beastly. Therefore any man feeling this desire would be beastly and only when she learns to regard sexual desire as natural does she find happiness and the beast is transformed into prince charming. The film has a stronger masculine quality with emphasis shifting away from Belle towards the beast's character. The film has also been interpreted in terms of the creative process of artist and muse, suffering for your art. Cocteau also includes many references to mythology (ex: Pavilion Of Diana) pointing to the origins of the tale. Cocteau's version includes elements of the Cinderella fairy tale with the inclusion of the ugly sisters.

Jean Cocteau asks us, as an adult audience, at the start to suspend belief and see as a child, which was directed at critics whom he regarded as being too arty or intellectual, one notable being Jean-Paul Satre who had criticised Cocteau for his lack of political commitment. Cocteau replied that his only commitment was to himself and his art. (The suffering artist)

Josette Day and Jean Marais star as Beauty and the Beast respectively. Josette Day has exquisite statuesque presence, which gives her an unattainable cold quality, which is far removed from the original inquisitive nave peasant girl of the original tale. Jean Marais gives an excellent poetic theatrical performance of the beast suffering for beauty. Jean would later act in another Cocteau masterpiece, `Orphee'(1950). Together for lack of a better word they are magical. The cinematography was by Henri Alekan (Roman Holiday; Wings Of Desire) but I believe Cocteau to be the real genius behind everything in this film: set design, lighting, structure, symbolism, multiple layers, a real auteur.

I cannot recommend this film more highly, it's in my top 10 films of all time and it's unlikely to ever leave. If you don't like this then seek help.",1161043200,4,2553,5.100478468899522
30355,5,0780020715,"In this, his first feature film, director Jean Cocteau set a standard for filmmaking that not even he could surpass. A masterpiece of inventive, surreal imagery, this film captivates the viewer as few other films have. Haunting, lyrical, and enchanting, this film retells the story of an age old fairy tale classic, ""Beauty and the Beast"" by Jeanne Marie LePrince De Beaumont. The film is sheer poetry in motion.

This marvelous, exquisitely rendered adaptation centers around the core of the fairy tale. An impoverished merchant (Marcel Andre) comes across a most unusual chateau, deeply hidden in the forest, where he is provided with hospitality by an unseen host. Upon leaving, he happens to break off a rose from a rosebush in the garden of his reclusive host, in order to take it back to Beauty (Josette Day), the most beloved of his three daughters. This simple act calls forth his previously unseen host, The Beast (Jean Marais), who tells him that the theft of that which The Beast loves most will cost the merchant his life or the company of the one whom the merchant loves most, one of his daughters. Allowed to return home temporarily, the merchant tearfully recounts what happened to him, and Beauty surreptitiously goes in his place to the enchanted chateau upon a magical horse that seems to sparkle with fairy dust. It is there that she, too, meets The Beast. Alas, the path of true love does not run smoothly, and Beauty and The Beast, together, make that discovery.

Be prepared for a visual feast of dreamy black and white cinematography, as well as one of the most unusual sets ever to grace the silver screen. Living statuary, human candelabras, and tears that turn to diamonds are just some of the exquisite, surreal immagery that take the viewer's breath away. Superlative performances by Josette Day and Jean Marais, as well as an excellent supporting cast, make this, indeed, a film to remember! Filmed in 1946, time has not dimished the ability of this masterpiece to enchant and captivate the viewer. Bravo!",1159315200,,2034,4.875722543352601
30356,5,0780020715,"Although I have owned the Cocteau ""Beauty and the Beast"" on tape for a number of years, I was hesitant to buy the Criterion Collection restored version on DVD because I had read that there was a new sound track: an opera by Philip Glass. What was not clear to me was that the new sound track is only one of the options; another is the original sound track, much cleaner than on the tape version.

Many DVDs of restored classics include examples of the restoration; this one doesn't. I played the Criterion DVD, then my VHS version, and I was amazed at the difference; the DVD makes the film look as if it were made yesterday; the tape version has all the scratches, pops, and muffled dialogue that are more or less typical of tapes made from deteriorated films. The subtitles on the DVD are easier to read than the ones on the tape (the DVD uses a different type font), there are two different commentaries included among the options, and the Philip Glass opera version is there as well. There is a print bonus as well: a booklet that includes the text of the original fairy tale, Cocteau's comments on filming it, and a critic's comments on the film.

The opening credits alone are worth the price of the DVD: Cocteau himself, writing on a blackboard (the tape version only displays text against a background).",1158105600,20,1311,4.527426160337553

30358,3,0780020715,"La Belle et la Bte (Jean Cocteau, 1946)

You know the story, of course. Belle (Josette Day), the neglected and beautiful younger sister of two wastrel women, once noble but now in somewhat dire straits, goes to the castle of the Beast (Jean Marais) to pay a blood debt invoked by her father. The Beast, however, doesn't kill the girl, but ends up falling in love with her. Then the kiss, and the handsome prince revealed, and all that. You've seen the Disney version.

Don't let that fool you. Disney, as you probably know, oversimplifies everything, and when you put a fairy tale in the hands of a wonderful director like Jean Cocteau, you're going to get a much finer film. And while this is certainly not a perfect film, it does put paid to the puling mediocrity (with the catchy tunes) Disney cranked out.

Day plays a wonderfully nuanced Belle. She's far from the goody-two-shoes Disney portrays Belle as, a woman whose servitude to her two sisters has hardened her. As well it should have. She is honest, somewhat tactless, and a much harder heroine to mindlessly identify with. Her father sees her as a paragon of goodness, but really, if your two other daughters were like these two, who wouldn't? Marais as the Beast, however, is a bit more problematic. I grant you, a lot of the reason for this is that the film's makeup artist made the Beast look more like a teddy bear than The Wolf Man's Lon Chaney. Now, you and I both know the Beast is supposed to be a tragic figure, but really, making his fangs uneven and carefully coiffing his hairdo? The argument could be made that it went with his wonderfully stylized costuming, but were that the case, why couldn't he just kidnap a dentist and have some work done on that left fang? His delivery is somewhat stilted most of the time, but I'm willing to put that down to the difficulty of enunciating through what must have been pounds of makeup.

The film's ninety-three minutes also gives us less time than we really need to see the developing relationship between Belle and the Beast. With all the fairy tale's subplots needing to grab screen time as well (and Cocteau is almost lavishly faithful to the intricacy of the fairy tale), the centerpiece of the story gets oddly short shrift. Belle goes from abrupt dismissal to wanting to be the Beast's friend in a matter of frames. As the film goes on, things get a little smoother, but those first encounters between the two of them do jar.

The reason to watch this film, though, as with any Cocteau film, is the wonderful stylization in the sets. The Beast's castle is a wonder of disembodied arms as servants, busts that swivel their heads to follow characters' movements, magic mirrors, and the like. Cocteau wants to use the frame of the story to deliver a visual feast, and he delivers. The juxtaposition of the sunny town where Belle's family lives, which is your basic peasant town, and the Beast's sumptuous, but dark, castle is wonderfully done. Cocteau began his artistic life as a painter, and it shows in his set design.

La Belle et la Bte ends up being more a visual feast than a compelling story, but it's still worth watching after all these years. Fun and enjoyable. ***",1153267200,4,3196,4.608084358523726
30359,5,0780020715,"One of the great masterpieces of cinema and one of my all time favorite films. Jean Cocteau's version of Beauty and the Beast is by far the ultimate version of this classic fairy tale fable, bar none. Rarely is pure enchantment captured on celluloid  magnificently; Wizard of Oz, The Red Shoes, Snow White and Babe are among enduring examples of great cinematic enchantment, but Cocteau's version rules supreme above all others.
  Where to start? The magical castle filled with living statues, object d'art and magic mirrors that watch over Beauty? (The famous arms as candlabra protruding from the entrance hall walls is a famous image repeated as recently as in the musical version of Phantom of the Opera, itself of course another version of Beauty and the Beast.) Or the impossibly handsome and charming Jean Marais in triplet as  Beauty's suitor, the Prince, and the Beast? Perhaps the shimmering, gorgeous black and white photography, blessedly rescued, finally, in this restored DVD version? (For years Cocteau's film was only available via videos and rare televison viewings with wretched prints.) Or the addition of Philip Glass' new score? All of these things add up to make Beauty and the Beast one of the best films ever, but at the center of course is the master of the enchanted castle, the Beast himself. Looking like a cross between a bear and a cat, draped in elaborate costuming over the Beast outfit, still Marais manages to move with grace and lithe movements, balletic even, and is able to convey the Beast's tortured emotions and inner conflicts with his eyes, voice and gestures. Brilliantly conceived by Cocteau, modeled (as was the look of the entire film) after the great 19th century French illustrator Gustave Dore's rendering of the fable, Jean Marais is pure poetry as the Beast, who is one of the great romantic, tragic figures in art, a rose bearing, tortured, Byronesque being, conflicted  between his impossible love for Beauty and his own innate savagery (""I am a monster--yet my heart is good,"" he laments to Beauty, a heartbreaking line delivered in a way that stops you in your tracks).
  With this DVD restored version, one of the miracles among movies has been brought back to gorgeous life for new generations to treasure. Beauty and the Beast finally are united when the dying Beast turns into the handsome Prince. Upon seeing the film Greta Garbo is supposedly said to have cried ""I want my Beast back!""

30360,5,0780020715,"The folks at Criterion never fail to amaze me, I for one am exceedingly grateful for this high quality re-release of a much loved masterpiece.  Jean Cocteau's La Belle et La Bette is a virtually perfect movie, visually spellbinding and deeply satisfying from both an emotional and psychological perspective.  While Cocteau's special effects may seem familiar to us now, bear in mind that they were stunningly original when he created this film.  Which brings me to my thought, however modest.

Sometimes stories do not improve in the retelling.  To see what I mean, track down Disney's handling of the classic fable, and see how his mouse-eared crew of sanitation engineers removed the dread, sex, and drama from it.  Then track down the Shelley Duvall Faerie Tale Theatre version starring Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski, and see how - even with a tiny budget - superb acting and art direction give the story its dark passion and truth.  Then watch Cocteau's film, the original, the version that has never been equaled, much less surpassed.  The difference is astounding.

Despite the primitive filmmaking techniques, this movie draws you into its ominous world where the stakes are life or death and self-sacrifice has a very special meaning.  I question the addition of a score by Phillip Glass, I love his work elsewhere but don't believe it belongs here.  But this is a minor quibble.  How lucky we are to live in an age where obscure gems like this are so readily accessible.  Cocteau was quite a guy, writer, poet, painter, filmmaker - a complete artist.  The complexity and depth of his daring vision are visible in every frame.",1150243200,7,1636,4.901818181818181

The Beast then falls hopelessly in love with her.

All the elements of a fairy tale are here: magical things (a mirror, key, glove), enchanted settings, evil sisters, and the message of a good heart being more important than looks. Yet the Beast is hardly ugly, just discomforting - which just adds to his allure. Cocteau was a unique filmmaker, working in a semi-surreal setting all his own. This is a marvelous movie, from the script to the costumes to the music (by George Auric).

30365,5,0780020715,"Concocting elaborate fairy tales is something the French do exceedingly well, and in La Belle et La Bete Jean Cocteau adapts Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic tale into a film masterpiece.

Cocteau opens the film with a short prologue in which he asks the audience to recall the time when we were children - and were able to believe in things we couldn't see.

Belle is the older sister in a family that has enjoyed prosperous times - in the past.  The widowed father has now fallen on hard times.  Many of his ships have been lost and when the last one finally comes to port, it won't even pay the debts he already has.  Belle has a younger brother and two wicked and greedy sisters who are determined to live as richly as possible - and they'll lie and deceive to accomplish this.

Father gets lost on his return from the bank where he discovers they're bankrupt, and in a storm he takes refuge in the mysterious castle he finds.  Inside the door, candlelabras light themselves and, even stranger, they're held by human arms protruding from the wall.  The arms hold the lighted candles and helpfully point the way.  A mysterious dining room waits, heated by a large fireplace with sculpted faces with eyes that follow your movements.

The story will be familiar enough to those who only know the cartoon version.  Jean Marais takes on the role of both the Beast (with its 5 hour make-up job) and the Suitor Avenant, who wants to marry Belle, but would like the Beast's treasure even more.  He is good as Avenant, but he's even better as the Beast, bringing an incredible vitality to the role under a hairy, fanged facade.

Belle is not the singing bookworm of the Disney version, but rather the beautiful, virtuous woman who would sacrifice her own life for her father.  Back at home Belle acts as a servant to her family, including the vain and bickering sisters - not because she's an orphaned step-child as in Cinderella, but out of the goodness of her heart.

Henri Alekan photographed the film in a scintillating black and white. About half the film was shot in beautiful locations in France and the rest on elaborate sets by Christian Berard.  The spectacular costumes were designed at the house of Jeanne Lanvin, with Pierre Cardin supervising the men's costumes.

I have long held a special place for the tale, because in addition to it's fantastical elements and wonderful story, the ""moral of the story"" is very moral indeed.  Not just ""don't be greedy or bad"" as in most other fairy tales, but emphatically ""be good, and virtuous"".  Without at least some of societies members willingness to be virtuous, society will crumble.  ""La Belle et La Bete"" teaches that virtue has rewards in a most enchanting manner.

Not recommended for little children - but if your child is old enough to be curious about matters of substance, they're old enough for this film.",1117411200,4,2873,4.683266932270916
30366,5,0780020715,"I vascillated for a long time on picking up this disc. Its pricey and I asked myself, how often I would want to revisit this film, practically memorized by now, having viewed it countless times over the years.

Yet something drew me to this edition, and the verdict is definitely a positive one. The restored version is lovely-all the incredible contrasts of soft greys, silver and stark blacks have been gloriously brought back to life. This what they mean by ""in glorious black and white!"" There is a clarity and richness here that gives the viewer an opportunity to notice subtlties that were obscured by the scratchy old print that was used on the VHS version. Gone are the distracting audio pops and clicks and most of the visual scratches, allowing the viewer to more readily fall into the dreamy trance of this timeless film.

Cocteau was a poet and a visionary,and despite the technical limitations of film in the 1940's, he brought real magic to the screen, something that today's digital wizardry doesn't always deliver. This is a richly textured retelling of this famous fable, full of detail and nuance. It is decidely more Grimms than Disney, so I don't recommend showing it to small children.  Charged with an undercurrent of eroticism and psychological symbols,it is really a fairy tale for adults.

The disc is packed with extras. I haven't yet checked them all out, but the ""Screening at the Majestic' is a nice documentary. I particularly enjoyed seeing Jean Marais, still very much alive and kicking, reminiscing at the very house that was used as the set for Beauty's family home. I started watching the film with the alternative Phillip Glass opera soundtrack and was amazed to find that the opera vocals are the exact original dialogue, and even more astounding, somehow he was able to sync the vocals precisely with the actors performance. Quite a feat for any composer. It's a bit eerie at first, but a great bonus that I will sit through and absorb someday. I'm looking forward  to seeing the Alekan interview as well.

Criterion generously fills the accompanying booklet with more gems; a translation of the original fable by Mme.le Prince de Beaumont is in there as well as a couple of fascinating essays, including Cocteau's own thoughts as to the meaning of his film.

While all the extras are a great addition, this version is worth the price of admission just by virtue of the film itself. This is a complex allegorical fairytale, filled with symbols and dream imagery. And like all great fairy tales (and dreams) it is filled with ambiguities and contradictions. Perhaps this is why we can come back to it again and again over the years,finding something new in it each time. Every time the ending comes I am confused and beguiled.

30370,5,0780020715,"This film is simply the greatest masterpiece EVER of surrealist cinema. Among the admirers of this great work of art are Picasso, Jung, Dali.

The film raises the question: What is beauty?

The answer suggested is the artist's eternal response -- beauty is inseparable from the imagination of its proponent and its recipient, which makes it a moral as well as an aesthetic quality. Hence, the three sources of the Beast's magic power in the movie: the rose (his love), the mirror (the ""canvas"" of the screen/camera), and the white horse (the imagination that transports the creative artist and audience members to an alternate reality -- which is the work of art).

In the end, the ""Beast"" is not only the most truly beautiful character of all, but the determining power in this cinematic world, for his magic is the total power of the imagination. The film director, then, plays the same role for the audience as the ""Beast"" does for ""Beauty."" The role of ""Beauty"" is, in fact, played by the viewer of this film. The viewer is seduced by the director's dreams and images that he or she is asked to share -- and thereby, to alter, as the darkened cinema becomes the Beast's enchanted castle.

30371,5,0780020715,"This film immediately captured my attention with the written comments at the beginning of the film. Director Jean Cocteau begins this story by explaining why he wanted to make this film.  He talks about the passion behind the picture and all the social unrest at the time.  He ends this written dialogue with a comment that will forever remain in my mind.  He says, ""...and now, we begin our story with a phrase that is like a time machine for children: Once Upon a Time..."" This just sent chills down my spine. Why? Because, although he is addressing children, I feel that it is really a phrase meant for all of us.  It is used to bring the child out in all of us, to show us that we do not need to be 4 or 5 to fully understand the themes of this film ... we are meant to just sit back and let the film take us to another mythological time.

The amazing set design also impressed me about this film. Again, without the modern conveniences of today's cinema, Cocteau had to improvise. This was hard for him to do. Not only were there huge budgetary issues (since it was the end of WWII and France was about to be demolished), but also he was racing against an impending war.  Fear was deep in the hearts of the French after WWII, and what a better way to rally your people then with a story about love found in the darkest of places.

This film also made me very sad. I am sometimes disgusted with the way that Disney ... for lack of a better word ... Disney-fies their fairy tales. I think after watching this masterpiece I will have trouble ever being able to go back to the computer generated ""Song as Old as Time"" version that Disney plastered their trademark to. Never have I been so impressed with black and white cinematography as I have been with this film. The actress that plays Belle, Josette Day, steals the camera every time it is on her. She looks so radiant with the black and white that to see a colorized version of this film would completely do it injustice. The power and emotion that comes between Belle and the Beast feels so true. Cocteau has somehow grabbed the true feeling of two people that are complete opposites that seem to find true love in the coldest of places. I would be one of those reviewers that believes that if this film were released today, it would still pull the audiences in as it did the first time. Only proving that it was made well before it's time, it shows so many of the characteristics of the modern day movie. Even the special effects seem perfect for this film. Even with budget being sub-par, we are able to get a true feeling that this Beast is one of the magical kind.

Oh, this film was superb. I would have to say that it is the best adaptation of a fairy tale that I have seen today. Definitely my best 40s film (made in 1946), and possibly the best telling of Beauty and the Beast EVER!!

Anyone who has seen it already will be able to recount multiple favorite images and delight in expounding upon them.  Film in the hands of some people seems to become more malleable. Cocteau is one such weaver of images whose fantasy world is at the same time childlike and foreboding - innocent as a puppet theatre ,then dark as sin.
 The film mixes fantasy and reality by presenting time spent in the ordinary world in straightforward, unambiguous scenes and juxtaposing these with theatre-like sequences that represent the parallel world of enchantment. Surreal set pieces, mists and blackness define the borders of the Beasts domain.
From the  Beasts smoking hands after the kill to the living arm sconces and the couples flight in the end, simple effects seem to gain impact from the bare uncomplicated nature of them thrust out into view like magic tricks.

30373,5,0780020715,"The 1947 French Cocteau classic, ""La Belle Et La Bete"" (Beauty and the Beast)was revolutionary in its day and on this new DVD, we get all the scoop on the making of this film and the masterpiece of French cinema. There is commentary by cultural historians and film critics, insight from the director, cinematographer and the cast and even more impressive, the opera by Phillip Glass, which he modeled after this same film. The film stars Josette Day as Belle and a costumed and frightening Jean Marais as the Beast. This film was released when World War II still weighed on people's shoulders. The French cinema was taking the film world by storm. It would be only one of many Cocteau films, though most assuredly his best work. The most impressive aspect of this film is its special effects and cinematography. Cocteau infused the film with surrealism and magic, enhanced by special effects which were new at the time, though tame and old-fashioned by today's standards. Before the digital, computer-generated image, there was ""camera tricks"". Cocteau was wise to make a film set to an enchanted fairy tale. He was able to make the bewitched castle seem alive. There is a prevailing eerie mood. Gargoyle, stone statuary, noctunal moods, voices, talking mirrors and doors, doors which open and close on their own and dimly lit candelabrum made the interior of the Beasts castle supremely Gothic and sensational.
As far as the acting goes, the cast does a good job at deliviring a good performance eventhough they are portraying fantasy characters. Josette Day is a beautiful and noble heroine as Belle and the Beast, monstrous in looks but gentle of spirit and kind hearted in a more human way. The story is more true to the original concept of Beauty and the Beast. This is not to be mistaken with the Disney 1991 animated film. There is very little cuteness and charm in this one. It's presented as a serious work of cinema. A must have for cinema students.",1077235200,9,1959,4.798816568047338
30374,5,0780020715,"This is a beautiful version of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale.  Cocteau creates a dreamlike world of fantasy and illusion.  There are two versions of the film available on this disk - one with spoken words and one with opera singing.  Both are French, subtitled in English.  I watched this movie twice in one evening - once with the spoken dialogue, once with the opera track.  I was enchanted by the beauty of the story, and the black and white picture adds to the mystery.  This is a film that I would watch again and again.",1077148800,2,533,4.387755102040816
30375,5,0780020715,"Beauty and the Beast is based on Madame de Beaumont's fairy tale with the same name, and Cocteau's adaptation is strikingly alike the original with a few exceptions.  The story begins with Cocteau explaining himself in the beginning of the film with a small statement in regards to children and their naivet and then the film opens as most fairy tales do with, ""Once upon a time...""  The father is raising one son, Ludovic, and three daughters, Felicie, Adelaide, and Belle (translated to Beauty) by himself.  Felicie and Adelaide are the malicious daughters that openly expresses their greed, sloth, and envy as they hurt Belle.  The son brings the family to the brink of poverty as he loses the family's furniture and valuables in a gambling debt.  On the way home from attempting to settle the debt, the father gets lost in a storm and he finds what seems to be a deserted magical castle.  In the morning when the father gets ready to leave the castle he finds a rose and remembers that Belle's wish was to receive a rose, however, the Beast appears and expresses his dislike for theft of the rose and tells him that he must pay with his life or the life of a daughter.  When Belle finds out she caused her father this anguish she voluntarily gives herself to the Beast.  Beauty and the Beast is a fairy tale that teaches lessons as stories should, and there are several lessons worth learning in this magnificent adaptation by Cocteau.  The special effects in the film enhance the magic as Cocteau presents his vision of Madame de Beaumont's fairy tale.  Overall, the supreme realism which is observed in the Beast's humanity is a major factor in the films influence of a brilliant cinematic experience.
As Jean Cocteau stated in his essay of his own film, Beauty and the Beast,  ""I have tried to give you something of what led me into an experience that I shall not repeat, because true experience must be unique. I can only compare it once again to the casting forth of a seed, which falls on favorable or unfavorable ground, blowing where it will.""  Hence, Beauty and the Beast is truly a unique cinematic experience.",1076198400,,2124,4.649732620320855

Either way, no one can ever out do this the way it was filmed years ago.  Can't believe the special effects they had then.  Costuming is also first rate.  Can't say enough about this movie and the dvd edition.  I saw the earlier version criterion had and this one jumps all over it.

30378,3,0780020715,"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I preferred the animated Disney version of this story to the 1946 Jean Cocteau film.  I'm no Disney fan, and I would personally like to stop them from taking over the world (along with Starbucks), but this is one case where I just thought they instilled this fairy tale with more magic.  I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version, and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects.  And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music, and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version.
However, on its own terms, the 1946 release is well done, and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beauty/beast tale.  I thought the acting was bland, though Belle is indeed a beauty.  And there are moments of pure movie magic: the candelabras that light Belle's way, the fireplace that watches her father eat.  And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel cliche.  But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed.  You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film, and when she professes her love at the end, it seems to come out of thin air.  And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end?  It doesn't get explained well at all.  Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face.
The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature.  He hunts wild game, he craves blood, and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her.  There's a violent eroticism underlying this film, that I found surprising for the year it was released.
I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales, and I have no problem doing that.  But even so, I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better.

30379,5,0780020715,"I previously reviewed Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST based on the earlier Criterion DVD, but I was just given the 2002 reissue as a gift, and I have to say that I am simply stunned at how good this disc is.  It is so superior to the previous DVD that I heartily recommend anyone owning any earlier editions to sell what they have and get this new version.
The film itself has been restored to pristine condition, in the best Criterion tradition.  The original soundtrack has been cleaned up to the greatest extent possible, though it does not compare well to modern films.  One of the unfortunate marks of English and continental filmmaking in the thirties and forties was the fact that their sound technology was several years behind what was being done in Hollywood, and it was only in the 1950s that they largely caught up.  The sound in this film, therefore, does not compare to the best in Hollywood, though visually the film stands comparison with any period.  The greatest thing about the audio tracks on this new DVD is the ease with which one can switch from the original soundtrack to the Philip Glass opera composed to accompanying the film to either of two commentaries.
This DVD is so stuffed with goodies that one wonders how it all fits on a single DVD.  You get documentaries, trailers of various sorts, the text of the tale the movie was based upon, the two aforementioned commentaries, and the magnificent Philip Glass opera.  To be honest, the Philip Glass opera is so spectacular that it would have justified the purchase price of the disc.  To have it included as a mere extra is extraordinary indeed.
I have several Criterion discs, and all are enormously impressive, but I have to say that this may be my favorite disc that they have yet put out.  We hear a great deal about piracy these days, but if the various media corporations would concentrate on quality products like this they would have less to complain about.  I still think the price is a tad high, but I will say that the quality of the disc at least makes one feel that their asking price is justified.
A favorite moment:  Beauty has left the Beast to visit her father and family, but dawdles for longer than she agreed upon.  The Beast, to encourage her to return, sends her his mirror.  She looks into it and sees her face, beautiful and reposed.  The surface of the mirror changes to that of the Beast, in great agony.  His face fades, to reveal her face again, only now pained and dismayed.  In a movie with dozens of marvelous moments this is one of my favorites.",1069804800,8,2559,4.554585152838428

30381,5,0780020715,"I have owned several video and DVD versions of ""Beauty and The Beast"" and this restored version took my breath away the first time I watched it.  It's almost like an entirely new movie, remade shot for shot, it's that much better than any other version I've seen.  If you had never seen it before, you would never think it was over 50 years old; it's that clear and unblemished.  It's the perfect movie to watch when one needs reminding that falling in love with a perfect physically beautiful person is quite wonderful, but true beauty has nothing to do with the exterior of a person.  The movie was made under difficult circumstances and the end result is a true work of art, created at a time when movies were made out of love, not a love for profit.  When one watches the movie, your eyes should never miss a second of it.  Some scenes in particular are works of art all on their own:  the candle sconces on the wall, lighting on their own and moving as they are passed; Belle's father picking the rose, which suddenly becomes illuminated; the first meeting of the Beast and Belle, when she faints; the statue of Diana coming to life; Belle running across the estate after she realizes she loves the Beast.  The exteriors were shot on a beautifully decaying French estate.  Any person who loves this movie should buy this version and throw all others away.",1057881600,11,1360,4.518367346938776
30382,5,0780020715,"I've been enchanted with ""La Belle et La Bete"" for as long as I can remember, seeing it at repertory movie houses more times than I can remember, even buying an original poster from its French release.
I thought I knew ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but seeing this DVD version, published by the reliably meticulous crew of the Criterion Collection, was a revelation and a delight.
Through long and painful processes (documented on the DVD), the scratchy, jumpy, fluttery-sounding film I loved has been transformed. The producers modestly say ""restored;"" I say nothing short of REBORN. No more scratches, hairy-looking objects, missing frames.... finally this masterpiece has, as Cocteau intended, the ""soft gleam of hand-polished old silver.""
The superb restoration alone would distinguish this release, but we're also treated to two fascinating and informative commentary tracks, numerous short segments including a ""making of"" the original film, recollections of various people involved in its production, the art of makeup, a whole alternate operatic soundtrack, and more.
When I could look away from the screen, I discovered a lavish booklet containing an excerpt from Cocteau's press book for the U.S. release of the film, a passage from a biography of Cocteau, and the entire original fairy tale (it was surprisingly short), handsomely laid out amidst a selection of still photos from the film, all suffused with that patina of old silver.
Criterion rather immodestly calls the result ""breathtaking,"" and proclaims it is ""...proud to present the definitive edition"" of a ""masterpiece."" They deserve to be proud; I cannot imagine a better treatment of this classic and beloved film.",1056585600,14,1681,5.323308270676692

It reminds me of the magic of Japanese Kabuki theater, where spotlights are candles on long wooden sticks and the oceon is scarves waving about,  so much more magical than modern
technology.
I also find Ray Harryhaussen special effects magical.(Jason and the Argonauts, the Seventh voyage of Sinbad)

The live production of Philip Glass's opera has toured all over the world to standing ovations and critical acclaim.  A big thank you to Criterion for this wonderful DVD.

30387,5,0780020715,"""La Belle et la Bte"" is unquestionably one of the finest films ever made. I have owned the Criterion DVD since it came out in 1998 and was a little weary about getting the second Criterion DVD of the same movie in just five years. I was wrong: the second DVD is better and here's why. I features the 1995 official, estate-approved, European mechanical and digital restoration of the French master picture and sound negative as opposed to a half-hearted, image-only, American restoration of an American master of the film (the introduction and titles are different from the French version). The 1995 restoration not only did away with practically all artefacts, it restored the movie's sheen, contrast, brilliance, stability and rhythm. The sound is greatly enhanced and free of pops and hisses (2.0 mono digital on this disc, as opposed to 1.0 mono digital on the previous one), even though some distortion in a very loud musical passage (Belle putting on the glove for the first time) was absent from the U.S. print. Also, some missing frames from the French print, which the French redid digitally, were always present on the U.S. print (restorers should talk to each other more often but copyright law is probably involved here). There is a second commentary that is more to the point than the previous one (also offered) and the documentaries and interviews (4 in all, including a restoration documentary and 1995 interviews with the surviving members of the cast and crew) are all French-made and a marked improvement over the 60's, American-made, slightly embarrassing ""after-school special"" of the preceding version. Finally, this new DVD offers as an optional track Philip Glass' (ahem) opera reprising the film's French script. As an opera lover, even one seeing the distinct possibilities of ""La Belle"" as a lyric piece, I really would like to say this opera pays homage to Cocteau's words, on some level. But the reality is that I find Mr. Glass' minimalist work tedious and abysmally inept. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It make one appreciate the French comedians' natural delivery and opulent expression all the more, as well as Cocteau's occasional use of silence to create mystery. The opera's French lyrics are horribly mangled in pronunciation, delivery, metre and a little something the French like to call ""tonic accent"", which is totally missing. A Yankee wrote this opera and George Gershwin he ain't! I don't care how much you are enamoured of the supposed avant-garde, there comes a time when one has to turn the page, musically speaking. I think there should be a special circle of Hell dedicated to Mr. Glass' endlessly repetitive creations. As a Frenchman, I could not decipher one fourth of the words even knowing the script by heart. The singers' diction is actually insulting not only to the script but to the French language in general. Couldn't this production afford a French-language coach? Other negative points: the synchronization of the singing with the actors' mouths is only approximate and comes at the price of shortening some of Cocteau's best lines (the opera comes with its own subtitles). This opera is by necessity comprised of recitatives interspersed with orchestral passages and devoid of arias. As recitatives go, these are rather lifeless and predictable affairs. Also missing are the humour and vitality of the comedy scenes, the sound effects and, most of all, Georges Auric's immortal music. Auric had a hundred times more on the ball, harmonically and melodically, than Glass ever will. His music seems to come out of the night air and return there when it's done and is always surprising even after one hundred hearings. Glass' score is what could be wickedly called ""duotonic"" for lack of a better word, since it seems to be based on the same two notes and the same two arpeggios (recycled from his score to the 1931 ""Dracula""). Glass' feeble attempts at sound effects, furthermore, are ludicrous, e.g.: Belle's first running away to join the Beast, a day-for-night scene, that Glass transforms into daytime with the use of jolly, insomniac, totally out of place, chirping birds. On the plus side: replacing the single voice of Belle's door and Belle's mirror with a male chorus was a good idea musically, but hardly worth the price of admission. What would have been a marvellous idea is to provide on an extra track a totally synchronized version of Swiss conductor Adriano's complete reconstruction and recording of the original Auric score in 5.1 stereo. It could also have been either isolated or synchronized with the dialogue and effects track, assuming this isolated track does exist, which it probably doesn't. But if you need a confirmation of Cocteau's and Auric's genius, I couldn't recommend a better tonic than this DVD which offers a look at what ""La Belle"" could have sounded like without Josette Day's magical, enchanting voice and Jean Marais' multilevel interpretation of the Beast. No couple ever made better-sounding music, with or without an orchestra.",1047772800,10,5039,5.043165467625899
30388,5,0780020715,"Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946) is not only one of the greatest films I have seen - a perfect blend of poetic fantasy and psychological depth - it's also one of my all-time favorites. The restored version from the Criterion Collection is among the best DVDs I have seen, both for the breathtaking clarity of the image and sound, and for a wealth of supplemental materials, including several fascinating documentaries, essays in a lavish printed booklet, and Philip Glass's complete opera synched to the film on a separate audio track.
With each re-viewing of Beauty and the Beast, I see new layers of Cocteau's vision. As a child, I was enthralled by how real, and actually lived in, this fairy tale world seemed. And I was spellbound by the Beast, brought fully, both horribly and tenderly, to life by Jean Marais' riveting performance. I will never forget the Beast's death scene, when Marais expresses worlds of pain, love, and self-understanding solely through the eyes peering out of a feral, hair-covered face.
The film does not need today's digital special effects; it still works perfectly with its own low-tech but deeply resonant wonders. And it is a triumph of design. Cocteau worked closely with production ""illustrator"" Christian Brard and cinematographer Henri Alekan to give the picture what he called ""the soft gleam of hand-polished old silver."" It is filled with simple but gorgeous - and unforgettable - tableaux, from a corridor of disembodied human arms grasping candelabra that burst into flame as you pass by, to Beauty gliding in slow motion through the enchanted castle. Then there is the indefinable magic of the scene at the manor with huge white sheets drying in the sun, creating silhouettes of striking power. (Cocteau's crew spent weeks searching everywhere for sheets without patches, an almost unheard of luxury in postwar France.)
Technically, and aesthetically, it is astonishing how Cocteau wrested so much visual interest from a film comprised almost entirely of medium shots. A close look reveals how dynamically, yet subtly, unbalanced most of the compositions are. We rarely see a subject head on, but rather from a slightly skewed angle. And during some of the most important moments, Cocteau foregrounds an unimportant object (a candlestick, a tree branch) to block our view, to make our imaginations fill in the obscured main details. Throughout he also makes evocative use of shadows, both where you would expect them, in the Beast's mysterious realm, and where you might not, in the merchant's strangely foreboding manor house. This tense visual quality meshes perfectly with the film's complex emotional nature.
On one level, Beauty and the Beast is a perfect, and largely faithful, realization of a great fairy tale, originally written in 1756 by French author Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont while she served as a governess in Scotland. But Cocteau's film exists on many other levels as well, which is why it continues to appeal as much to adults as children. There have been many interpretations, including symbolist, Jungian, Freudian, deconstructionist, and even gay readings (Cocteau is not only a preeminent author, poet, artist, playwright, and filmmaker of the 20th century, he is also a central gay icon). All of these views help reveal the many, and sometimes contradictory, layers of Cocteau's vision.
At its simplest and most direct, the film paints a moral lesson as easily understood by a child as by most adults: Who and what you are - your true nature - matters more than your appearance. We see this idea embodied, in troubling ways, by many of the human characters, including Beauty's two wicked sisters and, to a lesser extent, her wastrel brother Ludovic. But the most morally ambiguous character, and the one who gives the film considerable emotional depth, is Avenant. He is, of course, played by Jean Marais, who also performs the Beast and, at the end, Prince Ardent. Avenant is strikingly handsome, self-assured, and energetic, yet Marais also brings out his darker side, subtly in his attempted seductions of Beauty and overtly in his fatal greed at the end. What compounds Avenant's resonance for the film comes out in one of the final lines. Beauty answers Prince Ardent's question about whether she loved Avenant with a breathless, ""Oh yes!"" How, and why, could our heroine - who comes to see through the Beast's fearsome persona to the torn yet righteous man within - ever have been in love with someone like Avenant? That is yet another of the film's emotional mysteries, the ones which may appeal more to, and perhaps even unsettle, adult viewers.
One of the most fascinating, and visceral, comments on this film is musical. Composer Philip Glass (whose works include the operas Einstein on the Beach, Satyagraha, and The Voyage, and film scores Koyaanisqatsi, Mishima, and The Hours) set Cocteau's screenplay to music which runs simultaneously with the picture on the DVD, as the composer intended. The film's original, magisterial score by Georges Auric is one of cinema's greatest; and Cocteau knew exactly when to use it - or silence - for maximum effect. But Glass uses his patented syncopated rhythms and repeated symmetrical sequences of chords to create a haunting alternate voice for the picture. Distinct from Auric, Glass's score reveals the sometimes dark and disturbing emotional subtext, rather than the fairy tale sense of wonder. Previously I had liked the opera as an audio recording; but when joined with the film I found it utterly compelling.
Beauty and the Beast is a film I look forward to reexperiencing for the rest of my life. It has a way of getting under your skin, even entering your dreams. The closer you look at it, the more mysterious, and spellbinding, it becomes.",1047427200,241,5789,5.056485355648536
30389,4,0780020715,"The Criterion Collection has released its second DVD version of Cocteau's masterpiece, this time featuring the extensive 1995 Luxembourg restoration done for French cinema's centennial. The black-and-white film, mono, in French, comes in its original aspect ratio of 1:33.1. The restoration -- detailed on the DVD -- removed most of the scratches and dropouts that plagued the original nitrate negative. While viewers will marvel at the quantum leap in video integrity and continuity, owners of the 1998 Criterion DVD may want to hang on to their discs. Missing in action from the 2003 version -- which appears a bit flat after all that scrubbing -- are the dramatic contrasts of the previous restoration, done in the United States. (The older DVD presentation bears major scratches throughout -- pick your poison.)
Regardless, the new ""Beast"" DVD comes with significant upgrades over previous U.S. video versions. The notoriously bad audio loses almost all of its persistent scratchiness and lack of dynamics -- giving the ""Beast"" back his roar. The English subtitles benefit from much-needed care in translation and presentation.
Another notable change is the resurrection of Cocteau's original opening -- the live-action titles in which the stars' names are hastily written on a blackboard and the director's handwritten message to the audience.
Modern-day composer Philip Glass' ""Beauty and the Beast"" opera -- usually performed live as Cocteau's movie plays as a silent film -- comes on an optional audio track, in Dolby Digital 5.1. There's an undeniable thrill in having ""Beast"" unspool as Glass' hypnotic music swirls around the room, but the replacement of the original actors' dialogue with opera singers' wailing quickly wears thin. The opera comes with its own set of subtitles.
The new DVD carries over the 1991 commentary by film historian Arthur Knight that appeared on the original Voyager laserdisc and on the 1998 DVD. The talk is informative, but one gets the feeling Knight would rather be talking about the director's first film, the avant-garde ""Blood of a Poet"" (1933). Bringing a fresh second opinion to the disc is cultural historian Christopher Frayling, whose talk is as good as it gets in academic film commentary. (Sir Christopher's track was recorded in 2001 for the British Film Institute.) Frayling greatly admirers Cocteau's film but doesn't hesitate to point out weaknesses. Unlike Knight, Frayling stays on topic, moving scene-to-scene with the film but never wasting time with the obvious.",1047254400,11,2525,5.315

30393,5,0780020715,"From the moment the Beast steps onto the screen from behind the rose bushes of his enchanted castle, you know you are in for a very visual treat: his make up, his costume, his terror! -- Cocteau has created a movie and characters that are so appealing to the eye and yet so real.  Watching this DVD, I was captivated by scene after scene of beautiful imagery and artwork.  Cocteau's movie is magnificent and this new edition DVD is a perferct showcase for it.
There are many similarities between this and the new version by Disney, and you can certainly see where Disney was inspired.  Still, this is a gorgeous film that is sometimes frightening, sad, and triumphant.
On this DVD you get a perfect transfer, stills, and TWO audio commentaries that are insightful and entertaining.  I recommend buying this and watching it with the Disney version -- also a great film.",1045699200,,868,4.690789473684211

Classics like this, which have already survived the test of time, tend to get picked up by two-bit distributors and released in the most disgraceful of manners. Thank god for the Criterion Collection; This lavish transfer will not disappoint those with a healthy aesthetic. Reading a lot of the other reviews, I've noticed that they've mentioned something about the sound quality: it's true, even in the newly restored edition there are some imperfections, but I don't think that is enough to merit less than 5 stars (maybe 4.5, but that's not an option.)",1045440000,4,642,4.845454545454546

The film does look pristine, but the depth of the original is missing.  It almost looks too squeaky clean and...well, digital.  Make no mistake, you'll be completely entrhalled by this DVD, but if you can get your hands on the other Criterion edition, do it.  You'll be even more enchanted.",1044576000,26,563,4.704081632653061

This is a sumptuous and very lyric film, a real one-of-a-kind experience, a masterpiece, and for sure, the very best version of the story. The Art Direction, the sets, the costumes, are all p-e-r-f-e-c-t....and the beast's make-up (mask) is great!!

30397,5,0780020715,"In the very beginning of this movie, the film maker genius responsible for its creation tells us that he wants us to suspend disbelief. He wants us to forget about the ordinary rules of reality, to accept what we see as real, as would a young child. Basically, he's telling us to fasten our seatbelts, because the movie is going to take off and never come back down.
There are movies, and then there are movies. This is a movie buff's movie, one for the ages. Why? Well, for starters, it was a miracle that this movie was ever made at all. If you check out the story behind its creation, you'll discover that because it was made right after World War IIa lot of the equipment used in it's production was in terrible shape. There was barely enough money to finish the movie. And people kept on stealing things from the set. Yet...this movie is perfect. The visuals literally will take your breath away. The acting will forever set the standard for any foreign film I will see in the future. And then there is...
The Special Effects
This movie without a doubt has the best special effects of any movie ever made. What do I mean? How about living furnature? Not inpressed? How about teleportation that ends in someone coming OUT of a wall? How about someone GLIDING across a floor? And let's not forget tears that turn into diamonds. Yes, the first time I saw this movie, I kept rewinding it because the special effects were amazing.
Good movies become dated, great ones never do. This movie becomes more amazing every time I see it. And the DVD edition is a definite must-have because the film has been cleaned up so much it looks practically brand new. This film just might have the best black and white photography of any movie ever made, and only the Criterion DVD does it justice.",1035676800,9,1782,4.503086419753086
30398,5,0780020715,"This classic 1946 adaptation of the classic fairy tale is a real find for anyone who happens to be browsing through the library, or who is interested in French cinema.  Famed French filmmaker Jean Cocteau directs this story about a beautiful young peasant girl who goes to live in an enchanted castle in the woods with a hideous looking beast.  Gradually, she overcomes her fear of the beast and comes to pity, and eventually love him.
The sets showing the inside of the castle are quite remarkable.  This has got to be one of the eeriest looking castles I've ever seen on film.  I especially liked our first view of the inside of the castle with all those candles being held by what looks like human arms coming out of the walls (they are in fact robotic).  The black and white cinematography is beautiful and luminous.
This film begs comparison with Disney's animated version of the same story.  Ultimately, both films are terrific, though this film is much darker and scarier.  Use discretion with showing this to young children, the beast could turn up in some child's nightmare.",1032825600,2,1083,4.7287234042553195

I bought this in the pretence that the actual movie itself would be english spoken.  So I was quite disapoined when I found out it hadn't realy been translated into english.  When you have to constantly read the subtitles its hard to actually enjoy the movie.  It was going at a fast pace.  This is why I give this DVD 3 stars intead of 5 stars.

It is black and white, but the cinematography is so beautiful and rich, you forget about the colorlessness. I gave 4 stars, just because this film is not for everyone.

30404,5,0780020715,"In this, his first feature film, director Jean Cocteau set a standard for filmmaking that not even he could surpass. A masterpiece of inventive, surreal imagery, this film captivates the viewer as few other films have. Haunting, lyrical, and enchanting, this film retells the story of an age old fairy tale classic, ""Beauty and the Beast"" by Jeanne Marie LePrince De Beaumont. The film is sheer poetry in motion.
This marvelous, exquisitely rendered adaptation centers around the core of the fairy tale. An impoverished merchant (Marcel Andre) comes across a most unusual chateau, deeply hidden in the forest, where he is provided with hospitality by an unseen host. Upon leaving, he happens to break off a rose from a rosebush in the garden of his reclusive host, in order to take it back to Beauty (Josette Day), the most beloved of his three daughters. This simple act calls forth his previously unseen host, The Beast (Jean Marais), who tells him that the theft of that which The Beast loves most will cost the merchant his life or the company of the one whom the merchant loves most, one of his daughters. Allowed to return home temporarily, the merchant tearfully recounts what happened to him, and Beauty surreptitiously goes in his place to the enchanted chateau upon a magical horse that seems to sparkle with fairy dust. It is there that she, too, meets The Beast. Alas, the path of true love does not run smoothly, and Beauty and The Beast, together, make that discovery.
Be prepared for a visual feast of dreamy black and white cinematography, as well as one of the most unusual sets ever to grace the silver screen. Living statuary, human candelabras, and tears that turn to diamonds are just some of the exquisite, surreal immagery that take the viewer's breath away. Superlative performances by Josette Day and Jean Marais, as well as an excellent supporting cast, make this, indeed, a film to remember! Filmed in 1946, time has not dimished the ability of this masterpiece to enchant and captivate the viewer. Bravo!",1021680000,65,2032,4.875722543352601
30405,5,0780020715,"Goodness, to think it took me so long to discover this movie. Something so weird, yet so beautiful is right up my alley. The film is a classic fairy tale carried by the sheer force of the director's imagination.
The story is a familiar one, a lesson about inner beauty, yet we never once feel that we are being preached to. (Unlike a certain OTHER famous version that, while admirable in many ways, hasn't a serious thought in its pretty little head. I didn't mean to compare but the subject has already been brought up) From beginning to end, this is a cornicopia of visual delights.
Who could forget the scene of Beauty floating through a room with billowing curtains? Or when Beats drinks from her hands? Or the living fireplace that blows smoke from its' nose? Or the living statue of Diana? Or Beauty seeming to grow from the wall? Or Beast on his stomach drinking from a lake? Or.... Well, enough of that, see it all for yourself.
The only issue I can find fault with is the ending. For what its worth, this paragraph contains a spoiler though everyone knows the end of this fairy tale.
SPOILER
I was a little disappointed in the prince. After a character as wild and appealing as the Beast, you expect a little more from his human form. Every B&B movie has this problem, Prince Charming simply cannot compete. Making the Beast look like Avenant was a master stroke, though. It meant that in the end, everyone's outer form matches their inner self.
END SPOILER
Even if you are a fan of the Disney version, this movie has many delights and will even show how the Disney version got most of its idea. The only requirements to enjoy this film are the ability to read (it is all in French, the romance language suits the story very very well) and the ability to follow the instructions at the beginning: be a child for an hour and a half and be led into a magical world of romance.
Is it worth the money, though? Oh, yes, yes, yes. This DVD has been restored to great quality (for an old film) Plus, the audio commentary is actually very interesting (so many are repetitive) Enough excuses! Try this out for yourself and you will not be sorry.",1012608000,5,2145,4.460559796437659
30406,5,0780020715,"This movie is about a love so deep that it goes beyond the normal. Truly nothing was spared in making this movie one of the most intriguing movies of all time.
This is not a movie for children but for those who are old enough in years and yet young enough at heart to enjoy the mystery,suspense and thrill of it all.
The movie is done in French with English subtitles, but you will get so caught up in the movie that you won't even know your reading.",1010275200,,450,4.125
30407,5,0780020715,"I must start off by quibbling with the reviewer who said that the longest he had seen a child sit through this film was six minutes.  I quibble on two grounds:  first, who said that this was a children's film, and that how long a child could sit through it was a criterion of its merits?  It is very clearly intended for adults.  Second, one of the great memories I have of my daughter's growing up was her sitting in my lap when she was five years old in front  of the VCR, watching this film, with me reading her all the subtitles while we watched the film.  She was entranced!  And it was one of the greatest film viewing experiences we enjoyed together.
This film is, by any conceivable standard, one of the most imaginative, beautiful films ever created.  It is, to my mind, Cocteau's masterpiece.  He made this film at a time when a number of filmmakers in England and the United States had been creating fairy-tale like films for adults (in particular, Powell and Pressburger in Great Britain, but there were a number of Hollywood fantasy films from the same period).  But this one far outstrips the others in inventiveness and creativity.  By today's standards, when computers can make absolutely anything possible, the special effects are crude.  Yet, they remain more effective than many of today's state-of-the-art effects.  For instance, the disembodied forearms holding candles in the entrance hall, or the striking way that the Beast is resurrected in Avenant's body near the end.
I will go further in praising this film.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is easily the most artistically successful Disney animated film of the past few decades.  Yet, I do not believe that it compares favorably with the Cocteau film.  The Disney film has many virtues, but it lacks the extraordinary magic and wonder contained in the French film.  Perhaps because it is not an animated film, one sense that at any moment something magnificent might happen in Cocteau's film, and the miracle is that he so frequently is able to delight the viewer.  In animation, anything is possible, but using real actors and real objects, Cocteau is constantly able to produce utter magic.
Jean Marais is marvelous in his dual role as the cold-hearted and cruel but incredibly handsome Avenant, and the externally hideous but internally beautiful beast.  He throws himself enthusiastically into both roles.  I once read an interview with Cocteau in which he marveled at Marais's performance.  In one instance, Marais as the Beast throws himself prostrate in order to drink water on the ground.  The water was dirty and scum covered, but Cocteau was stunned that Marais frantically drank from it nonetheless.  With the possible exception of the title role in Cocteau's ORPHE, this is his greatest role.  The wonderful duality of the title comes out not just in referring to the beautiful young woman played by Josette Day and the beast portrayed by Marais, but the moral beast Avenant and the morally beautiful Beast, both portrayed by Marais.  It is needless to add that Marais was easily one of the most handsome men of the twentieth century.
This is a must-see classic.  It is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made, perhaps the greatest film version of a fairy tale, and the finest film made by Jean Marais.  That the film was produced so soon after the War (1946) is yet one more of the film's miracles.",1010016000,,3383,4.7979274611398965

Firstly the disc itself - superb extra's and the print is remarkably clean for it's age; another top job by Criterion.  As for the film...It is a true work of art, one of those films that are fantastic in every area in such a way that raises it above the standard of general excellence and makes it truly memorable.  But it is the sheer sense of wonder that deserves the most praise, the magic that surrounds the Beast's castle will make your jaw drop to the floor with a near continuous myriad of sumptuous special effects and brilliant inventiveness.  The performances are also wonderful and it is extremely moving as well as entertaining, with so many memorable moments...I really cannot fully express the delight this movie creates, you really have to see it.

30409,4,0780020715,"At the beginning of ""La Belle et la Bete"" the wonderful film based on Marie Leprince de Beaumont's book of the same title, the director, Jean Cocteau asks the viewer to become as little children and engage in the willing suspension of disbelief. Fortunately, I believe in mystical and magical things, so I found Cocteau's instruction easy to follow and was rewarded with thrills of excitement.
Criterion has performed it's usaual great service, restoring a masterpiece. The technical aspects--remastering of the 1946 black and white film appears to me to be very nearly perfect. But more importantly, ""La Belle et la Bete"" is truly a work of art. A documentary included with the DVD explains how Cocteau,  in spite of wartime shortages, was able to create his fantasy using the paintings of Vermeer and the etchings of Gustave Dore as a point of inspiration. Many of the most spectacular scenes are animated Gothic wood block prints! In an age of dazzling special effects, it is wonderful to know that creative geniuses have existed and once upon a time movie-making was based on  artistic genius, not just technological wizardry.
Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairy tale. In this version, Beauty is a convincingly good daughter and the beast is a convincingly bloody beast. Mornings after his nighly prowls little dead animals can be found in the courtyard. (He is unlike the cowardly lion in The Wizard of Oz). However, by the time the Beast is dying and Beauty rushes to his side, I am have come to care for him--if not love him. Jean Marais and Josette Day are very convincing.
Cocteau's ""La Belle et la Bete"" is closer to the original European tale than many other dramatizations. The purpose of these ""fairy"" tales was to impart a distilled bit of wisdom from one generation to another. ""La Belle et la Bete"" teaches an eternal truth--one does not love someone because of their appearance. True love is unconditional. If it is not unconditional, it is not love. As my mother used to say, ""You should not judge a book by it's cover"" -- although many of us do.",1008979200,17,2070,4.763231197771588

30412,5,0780020715,"I first saw this poetic, fantasy film back in the '50's, when I was about six or seven years old. In those days, Channel 13, in New York, would run foreign classics. Cocteau's Beauty And The Beast stood out in my memory, because of its haunting, surreal images. Of course, back then, I wouldn't know what the word ""surreal"" meant. All I knew was that the film was a hypnotic, yet beautiful, experience. About a dozen years passed, until I saw Cocteau's work of art again, on a UHF presentation, emceed by film critic Charles Champlain. (I could somehow make out the images, through all the ""snow"" on the screen.) Up to that point, I wondered if what I saw, on that flickering TV screen, during my childhood, was in fact itself a dream. Later, when I was in charge of film activities at my college, I arranged for it to be shown there. So I was once again able to enter the magical world that Cocteau had created.
This cinematic version of Perrault's fairy tale is far from pretty. In fact, it's downright scary in some scenes -- especially the ones in the Beast's house. So it's not something I'd recommend for young kids. Nevertheless, if you're a person who loves the mysterious beauty of shadowy B&W photography, and enjoys being transported into a Twilight Zone-ish world, where things aren't quite what they seem, this film is definitely for you. This version is for adults, or kids who are mature in their thinking (and can handle subtlety). For others, who can't get to that level, and who are geared towards Star Wars effects, and third-grade quality movies, Disney (Ugh!) will have to do.
Criterion did a fantastic job in the restoration of the film. And the bonus features, including a superb commentary, make it a doubly worthwhile purchase. Plus, the subtitles are easy to read.

Two years ago, I wanted to see THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST late at night after a working day. 30 minutes later, I was ejecting the DVD and could swear that this film was only an antiquity reserved only to nostalgics ones. Now, a few days ago, tired of the standardized Disneythings, I decided to show it to my children and stay for a while in order to explain certain scenes to them.
Believe me or not, they were literally hypnotized by the movie, rediscovering this fairy tale in a way unknown to them until then. I'm sure that the shadows of this black and white film are more suggestive than all the special effects of the world. The strangeness of the fairy tale comes from simple tricks already discovered in the first years of Cinema : clever editing, costumes and decors reminding the illustrated books of our childhood ( Gustave Dor, for instance ) , superb and disturbing slow-motions at the right moments and an impressive musical score.
Jean Cocteau wrote a screenplay very close to the first version of this well-known tale but he added some variations of his own : allusions to other tales such as "" The Sleeping Beauty "" or "" Cinderella "",  the important role given to the Temple of Diana, an element entirely invented by the French director, and the character of the Beauty's real world lover played by un unmasked Jean Marais.
This Criterion DVD also offers a very relevant commentary track, a 30-minutes TV show that unveils the multiple tricks used by Jean Cocteau in order to create the strange mood of the movie, the original text of THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST written in the XVIIIth century and a restoration demonstration.

30417,5,0780020715,"I bought this DVD because I hadn't seen the film but on knowing Criterion's feeling about releasing important works. I wasn't disappointed.
I would like to think that I know a little of films or at least I can tell from the beginning if I'm going to be watching a good film. I know my credability will be going out the window but as soon as I started to watch ""Shakespeare In Love"" I knew I was watching a movie that I would enjoy and I felt the sam with ""Beauty and the Beast""
From the very beginning of the film when the two ""pretty"" daughters come out into the farmyard to raise the men from their naps I thought that this film was going to be good.
Having read about the difficulties of getting this film made, the trouble was well worth it because the film is beautifully made.
I had to rediscover the story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and Jean Cocteau manages to take the basic story and turn it into a magical tale. The acting is wonderful, the makeup and costume of the beast is a sight to behold! And the camera trickery involved to make Beauty appear to come out of a wall is amazing for it's time in my opinion.
One of the most remarkable sights is of the interior of the Beast's castle. The candelabras are held by human hands and as aperson walks past they suddenly flare into light. The statues come alive and blow smoke across the room. All in all it's a very impressive sight and one that creates the illusion of a magical castle.
My only gripe about the film is once the beast transforms into a man the story ends quickly. I would have preffered to see a little of what happened to the daughter or thier reactions. The film ended a little too quickly for my liking.
The Dvd comes with a few extras which I admit to not having watched yet. The bonus material covering the cleaning of the film was very interesting. You see some of the scenes from the original and how they've been restored, it is amazing what can be done these days.

30419,5,0780020715,I was astounded at how captivated I was watching this movie. Every one knows the story - put Cocteau's rendition is pure art.,977356800,,125,4.478260869565218
30420,5,0780020715,"Before I have known Cocteau like a very interesting poet and stage writer and La Belle et La Bete is the first (but sure not the last) of his films for me. I was stunned by the visual beauty and surreal mood of the movie. It's amazing how a fairy tale, which is nowadays considered being a child's thing can be turned to a such at the same time macabre and beautiful piece of art by a great artist. Or maybe just returned to the roots? Take your kid's book, forget the Walt Disney images and try to think of what the fairy tales really mean. You will be scared to go to bed (there's something under it). To return to the film - the end left me totally perplexed: I'm not at all sure that they lived happily ever after.",972950400,5,718,4.099290780141844
30421,5,0780020715,"Sometimes artists can't improve on what's already been done.  Cocteau's ""Beauty and The Beast"" is such a masterpiece.  That it is shot in black and white only adds to its allure because it enhances the dream-like, fairy tale quality throughout.  This version is faithful to the beloved tale and Marais is so wonderful as the beast that you are almost disappointed at the end when he returns to being a handsome prince. The film's artistry also makes it gender-blind, that is, your husband will love it as much as you do without feeling like a wimp.  Mine does at any rate!

30422,5,0780020715,"There hasn't been a better filmed version of ""Beauty &the Beast"" either before or since this film. ((I know Disney dida film with the same title, but it wasn't the real story.))
Most people ought to know the story -- the well-to-do merchant who loses everything, his one last chance to recoup that falls through, the journey through the spooky forest that leads to the magic castle, the rose the merchant picks for his daughter, the angry Beast who demands the merchant's life, Beauty's return to the Beast's castle in her father's place, (...) and so on.
But you really don't KNOW the story till you see this film and let Cocteau make it clear for you.
Done on an obviously shoe-string budget, brilliantly applied, with camera-work and incredibly simple but effective ""special effects"" that truly enhance the story without calling undo attention to their own cleverness, with beautiful costume and makeup designs adding even more, this film is simply a visual treat.  (An example of the simple-but-effective effects is Beauty's return to her father's home -- the actress stepped backward through a paper ""wall""... and they ran the film backward.)
[This film is/was good enough that when the cable ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" series did ""B&B"", they basically did a 60-minute remake in color of this film, including most of the visual touches, especially the Beast's makeup.]
Beautiful, dreamlike and entrancing.",955929600,5,1405,5.082251082251083
