7812491,4,6301555899,"While I am not an expert on ballet (I am working toward that goal, but I may not live that long), as one reviewer, who panned this ballet,  the choreographer, Roland Petit, in this case, or the principal dancer, Dominique Khalfouni, here, I must say that I found the dancing, acting, costuming, sets, and story line to be most enchanting.  I saw the movie by the same name years ago with Marlene Dietrich and can, therefore, relate to the story of this ballet.",1430697600,,460,4.530120481927711
7812492,1,6301555899,"I have seen about 8 or 9 different ballets on video choreographed by Mr. Petit and frankly, this one is quite a boring affair. Dominique Khalfouni dances with class and brio but she is rather distant and does not impress me as a very good actress - this is a ballet based on a dramatic story after all. I have never been too enthusiastic about Mr. Petit's talents... and this piece seems to be the poorest thing I've seen by this French choreographer. Try ""Carmen"" if you want real drama, or ""Puss in boots"" if you""re after something lighhearted.",1006992000,4,546,4.525252525252525
7812493,5,6301555899,"I don't if this video is the same THE BLUE ANGEL I saw in theather many years ago. I only know that the one's I saw is performed by Curt Jurgens as the principal male star. If it is the same movie, how to get it? It is available in DVD?",1005436800,,236,3.6470588235294117
