7839582,4,6303162282,"I purchased this tape 12 years ago and still use the first half of it in a series of warmups before exercising. On easy days I use the full video. It's simple, easy to follow and provides the basic in body flexibility. It's a little cheesy but still a good vehicle to use. PS Kathy Smith is not in this video....",1218931200,,312,4.131147540983607
7839583,3,6303162282,"I have two other exercise videos in the Lethal series (Lethal Legs and Lethal Buns), which are better routines featuring this same exercise trio. This tape provides good toning for your abs using various types of abdominal crunches. It focuses primatily on the upper abs and the transverse muscles; not much lower abdominal work. The warm-up is not adequate, and a little clumsy. I prefer to stop the tape and extend the warmup with extra moves of my own.

But what is highly annoying are added voice-overs by Jennifer Martin, which provide posture tips, etc. Not only were they non-informative, but they were obviously tacked on post-production, and are much louder than the rest of the video. So annoying in fact, that I only do this tape about once a month.",1090368000,2,760,4.801526717557252
