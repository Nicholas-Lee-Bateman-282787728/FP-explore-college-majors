1826191,3,B0000844MI,"Friends is not the best thing on TV and at times can be dull and predictable but it goes down easy. Fun for rainy or sick days or when friends come over and you just want to vegetate and not think for half an hour. This is ""not-thinking"" TV and while there is alot of going round (and more being made all the time) and I shouldn't really encourage that, this is still enjoyable.
A guilty pleasure.",1042329600,2,397,4.1688311688311686

1826241,5,B0000844MI,"By the time the third season of Friends started in the fall of 1996, there was possibly only one other sitcom hotter than this one.  This story six friends trying to find their way in the world in New York City was a huge hit, and for good reason.  The characters are likable.  Even when they are making stupid choices, you want them to come out ahead.

This season of friends is the only one to not start out with a cliffhanger to resolve between Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston).  That's because they are still dating and quite happy together.  Instead, we start out with Monica (Courtney Cox) trying to get over her recent break up with Richard (season two guest star Tom Selleck who manages to return as a guest star once late in the season).  Chandler (Matthew Perry) is also in a relationship with a woman that his best friend and roommate Joey (Matt LeBlanc) can't stand.  Finally there's Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), who begins trying to connect to her brother (guest star Giovanni Ribisi).

Over the course of the series, our characters lives progress.  Monica eventually starts dating a millionaire who has dreams of becoming an Ultimate Fighting Champion.  Joey gets a job on a truly bad play where he falls for his co-star, who just happens to be dating the director.  Phoebe dates a diplomat. And this is the season where Chandler and Joey get their pets, a chick and a duck.

Somehow, the writers manage to fit two or even three stories into every episode, so all the characters have something to do over the course of the 22 minutes.  It really does amaze me how they juggle so much stuff and still tell good stories.

The Thanksgiving episodes of Friends were always some of the best of the series, and this season has my favorite.  In ""The One with the Football"" siblings Ross and Monica drag their friends into a game of football that opens up the old rivalry.  It's so funny.

Another highlight of the season is ""The One Where No One's Ready.""  This episode takes place in real time.  (And aired in 1996.  Take that, 24!)  Ross is stressing because none of his friends are ready to leave for a dinner where he's giving a speech.  Meanwhile, Rachel can't decide over what to wear, Monica is obsessing over a message on her answering machine, Phoebe is trying to cover a stain on her dress, and Joey and Chandler are fighting over a chair.  We never leave Monica and Rachel's apartment, but the laughs are outstanding as the stories all spiral out of control.

But you'll notice I haven't gotten to the big story of the season yet.  We can't leave Ross and Rachel happy, so part way through the season Rachel gets a job in fashion and Ross becomes jealous of her new co-worker.  Then Rachel decides they need to take a break, and a drunk Ross makes a poor choice.  While the fall out from that gave us one of the more serious episodes of the season, it also gave the writers a line that never grew old.  ""We were on a break!""  It also allowed the writers a chance to give us Ross/Rachel cliffhangers every single season for the rest of the series.  This one actually still felt natural (unlike some of the later ones which felt forced).  And this goes back to the point I made at the start of the review.  Even with how these episodes played out, we still wanted things to work out for both characters.

This ensemble cast is always strong in their acting.  Whether delivering a punch line or being more serious, I buy every minute up on the screen.  This is especially amazing during ""The One with the Morning After"" as Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer have to walk that fine line between comedy and drama.  They shine.

Season three hit shelves with 4 DVD's containing all 25 episodes of the show in full frame and surround sound.  The extras on disc four aren't that great, consisting mainly of recycled scenes and a quiz.  However, there are three commentaries from the executive producers of the show, and they are mostly interesting since they give the thought process behind putting that episode together.  The one on ""The One with the Football"" was especially good since it talks about creating the park where the characters actually played.

By the time the show ended, I felt like these characters had indeed become my Friends, so it's fun to go back and visit them again.  Whether you know them already or are just finding this great sitcom, you'll enjoy season three.",1431993600,,4413,4.5681528662420385

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I was hoping that the episodes would include the full length time as the DVDs do (FYI: the show on TV doesn't actually play the entire episode. They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.). I find myself really missing those extra couple of minutes, but I'm a hardcore fan. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! You can't ever go wrong with Friends.",1420502400,2,570,4.098214285714286

And if that is the case, why are you still reading this.  Go get it!  If you're still here (it's possible, I suppose) I will say that I, and many viewers can continue to care about these six fine individuals...sidenote:  now that they've got three seasons under their belt, can it be considered a trilogy.  Anyway, you are treated to an episode full of Star Wars references right out of the gate (how you take them in their context is up to you.)  We are finally treated to several episodes of Maggie Wheeler, whose character Janice is just as memorible as our favorite six.  Then there's Ross getting shot down by Isabella Rossellini...I kid you not.  There's a flashback episode that takes us back to when our favorite four and a half (Joey joins the group at that time and while Rachael is there, she obviously isn't a part of it yet) hung out at a bar (should have had some hangover-like flashbacks...might have been some interesting stories to tell there.  Rachael's fantasy at the end was certainly suggestive.)  And who can forget the racecar bed?  If all these references don't seem to add up, that just proves how great this show really is, because in the episodes, they do...they do all add up.

I watch the ten season first - then pick randomly the earlier seasons - likened to flashbacks. What a thrill ... my favorite couple has to be Monica and Chandler - their chemistry is amazing - beginning from day one. Rachel/Ross thingy - sometimes get 'old', though I was rooting for them in the end. I'm kinda sad that Joey has yet to find his soulmate. Phoebe and her man makes a cute couple.

Monica tries to get over break-up from Richard and dates a billionaire named Pete towards the end of the season. Phoebe is probably the most genuine and funniest character, love her performance in The One with the Dollhouse. Excellent season, I highly recommend it, enjoy!",1219363200,,594,4.666666666666667
1826504,5,B0000844MI,"While Friends has always struck me as a show that hit the ground running, the third season is where it really hits its stride.  It's at this point that the show becomes about more than funny episodes as it's the season when we really start to learn a lot about the characters.  Perhaps reviewing this season is most easily done by highlighting the episodes that contribute to each character's story arc.

Monica's season is off to a bad start as she does her best to try to get over Richard.  It's also the first time that we really begin to see just how desperately she wants to have children, as evidenced by ""The One with the Jam"".  This is a theme that becomes very central to her character, all the way up until the show's final episode.  We also get to see Monica fall in love with a guy to whom she is initially not attracted and who seems to be the perfect man until he begins to pursue a rather suicidal goal.  ""The One with the Tiny T-Shirt"", ""The One with a Chick and a Duck"" and ""The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion"" are central to this story arc.

For Rachel, everything seems to be going really well--except for her job.  The much celebrated Ross and Rachel relationship is in full swing at the start of the season but things start to break down in episodes like ""The One with All the Jealousy"" where Ross can't deal with Rachel's handsome new coworker and friend.  I particularly like how Rachel begins to come into her own this season and realize that she can follow her passion in life rather than marking time at the coffee shop.  While she is happy with Ross, she also begins to appreciate the value of having her own career and of doing something solely for her own fulfillment.

Phoebe begins to learn more about her origins in this season and her storyline is very much enhanced by the priceless episodes in which guest star Giovanni Ribisi plays her half brother, who she meets in ""The One with Frank Jr.""  We also find out about Phoebe's past musical career aspirations in ""The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner"" whose ending is simply classic as said partner sells Phoebe out once more, this time by pitching ""Smelly Cat"" to a kitty litter company.  By the end of the season, Phoebe learns the shocking truth about her parents in ""The One at the Beach"", which is a packed episode due to its advancing multiple plotlines.

Joey shows unexpected sensitivity this season when he falls in love with a haughty co-star and then has his heart broken.  It's particularly funny to watch him call all of the women he has slept with in the past (""The One with the Dollhouse"") so that he can apologize to them for treating them the way he himself has just been treated.  ""The One with the Screamer"" is also classic Joey because we are treated to a snippet of a scene from one of the downright awful plays in which he has the lead role.

Chandler's on-again-off-again relationship with the sweet but irritating Janice continues into this season with the particularly funny ""The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel"" in which Chandler gets a bit overzealous in his rush to prove he's over his fear of commitment and then commiserates with Rachel and Monica.  Janice exits the scene once more when Joey witnesses something in the hilarious ""The One with the Race Car Bed"" that will ultimately lead to the dissolution of that relationship.  In typical Chandler fashion, he then finds himself finding fault with yet another woman in ""The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner"", though he is mature enough to admit that he's being rather terrible for it.  At the end of the season, we begin to get a hint of the crush Chandler seems to be developing on Monica when in ""The One with the Beach"" he offers to be her boyfriend if she can't find another.

This is also a good season for the development of Ross and we begin to see just how petty he can be--but his pettiness is in equal measure to his kindness.  He lets his outrageous jealousy get the best of him in ""The One with All the Jealousy"" and then he refuses to listen to Rachel and humiliates her at work in ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break""--and then follows this up by sleeping with another woman.  However, in ""The One with the Tiny T-Shirt"" we see how kind he can be and he follows this up with a selfless act which results in his missing his much-anticipated chance to be on the Discovery Channel.

Though there are so many varied plotlines during this season, we are shown over and over examples of the devotion these six people have to one another and I think it can't help but make the average viewer feel a bit envious.",1204502400,2,4591,4.482593037214886

1826551,5,B0000844MI,"Thank God the writers weren't!

I'm not a big fan of 'cute' sitcoms overflowing with 'cute' people, but Friends just wipes me out. It's so much more than just a gang of attractive people going through contrived situations, spouting contrived lines. The writing, acting, direction are all of the highest quality, and that's why it was so popular, year after year after year. It was no promotion stunt that saw each of the stars on $1m an episode by the final season! It's unusual to find a show with 6 lead characters in which all 6 can actually take the lead. Usually, one or two of the characters are head and shoulders above the others, so everything has to revolve around them and when things don't, the show falls flat. Friends really bucks that rule. The dialogue is so sharp and the characters so well drawn that virtually any show, involving any storyline, around any character is a knockout success. Season 3 is one of my favourites. It's both touching and funny how Ross and Rachel finally get it together in season 2 after making viewers wait so long. And that's only the start - without spoiling anything, things don't exactly run smoothly in season 3. 'The' argument is one of my favourite episodes. Absolutely hilarious. So much so, it spawned a long running catchphrase. If you've never watched Friends, you missed out on some of the best TV of the last decade.

I'm not sure what the writers accomplished with the chick and the duck.  I respect the way the show maintains continuity in plot and character, and the chick and the duck show up in the final episode.  Just stretches the imagination a little too much.

Perhaps the fight and break-up of Rachel-Ross as brutally as it is played out in this season is necessary to set up the comedy and tension which works so well in Season 8.  I found it to be too real in Season 3, or maybe I had already embraced Ross/Rachel as real-time people. Their break-up was painful for me.",1167523200,,670,4.450819672131147

It also contains the (first) breakup of Ross and Rachel, which is very well done.  ""The One Where No One's Ready"" is one of the best episodes in the series, done in real time, and ""The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel"" shows Chandler's entertaining struggle to commit with Janice.  Other particularly noteworthy episodes are: ""The One with the Tiny Tee-shirt,"" ""The One Without the Ski Trip,"" and ""The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister.""

Quotes from this season:

- Ross: You never look. You just answer. It's just a reflex. ""Do I look fat?"" Nooo! ""Is she prettier than I am?"" Noooo! ""Does size matter?""

Rachel: Noooo!

Ross: And it works both ways.

1826593,4,B0000844MI,"The third season of ""Friends"" showed that the show had found a comfortable groove, but as the season wore on it seemed as if the writer's were starting to lose some of the spark that made the first two season such successes. Still, Season three gave us some of the most important hallmark epsiodes in the series-- ""TOW No One's Ready,"" classic Friends and is the beginning of the ""bottle"" epsiode tradition on the show where all six characters were in one room together driving each other crazy; ""TOW the Football,"" a classic Thanksgiving episode where the true dorkiness of the Gellar family is revealed and of course the episodes that marked the beginning of the end (or the beginning of the end of the beginning or something) of Ross and Rachel, ""TOW Ross and Rachel Take a Break"" and ""TOW the Morning After"" Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and so real in these episodes and I remember mourning the loss of the relationship just as much as Ross and Rachel did. Other hysterical episodes from this season include ""TOW the Flashback,"" ""TOW Frank Jr.,"" ""TOW the Race Car Bed,"" ""TOW Monica and Richard are Just Friends,"" ""TOW Phoebe's ex partner"" and ""The One Without the Ski Trip"" As I said before the episodes that closed the season didn't seem to have the same punch to them that the earlier ones did and it seemed as if the show was becoming more routine and formulamatic (an impression that quickly dissappears with the next stellar season). The actors are also more comfortable in their roles and are beginning to explore different aspects to their characters. Courteney Cox does a commendable job as Monica tries to deal with her break up from Richard, and Matt LeBlanc gives audiences a preview of what's in store for Joey later in the series, as Joey for the first time actually feels a deep attatchment toward a woman (Kate Miller). Lisa Kudrow is still stellar here as Phoebe continues her struggle to find family (a struggle that ends in an unpredictable way in ""TO at the Beach""). Matthew Perry, who I believe was struggling with his addiction at this time,  also shows a different side of Chandler as once committment weary Chandler begins to search for a meaningful relationship. And as mentioned before Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and real in this season and steal the season with their performances in the episodes dealing with Ross and Rachel's breakup. While the last six episodes or so are not the best in the Friends collection, the season is still worth while and hit some really high points.",1148428800,,2531,4.70045045045045
1826594,4,B0000844MI,"The Third Season of Friends, for me, was quite an improvement over Season Two. For Season Two I had a hard time picking the top 5 episodes as none of them were THAT great. Now for Season 3 I can have an easier time as there are more better episodes to pick from.

During the third season, one thing that bugged me a bit was Matthew Perry, he was very seriously ill during this season with his Alcohol and drug problems and therefore his physical appearance on the show was extremely gaunt, he was very very thin. Whenever I watch season 3 and I see him all I can think about is the actual trauma going on in his life and that all this Chandler stuff is fake. Anyway apart from that the 3rd season was quite good!

Though it contains one of my least favourite epsiodes, The One With The Football (a lot will dissagree..I am NOT a football fan), Season Three has its share of good moments.

My Personal Top 5 Episodes are:

The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy

The One With The Flashback (My Favourite of the Season)

The One With Phoebe's EX Partner

The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break

The One With The Morning After

Season Three of the show has a better bunch of shows than the previous I think. Though one other thing the show could've done without was Monica's new relationahip with the ''ultimate fighting champion''(????!?!?!) guy. That wasn't really needed.

An emotional episode was The One With The Morning After. The scene with Ross and Rachels final decision to break up where the rest of the friends are stuck in the room has David Schwimmer and Jennifer Anistons best acting to date. You can really feel the emotion there, BELIEVE ME!

Oh well, Season Three is pretty good, it starts the trend of good seasons. Buy this DVD today!",1145923200,,1754,4.433021806853582
1826595,3,B0000844MI,"I think most fans of Friends consider Season 3 to be the best.  It certainly sets up much of the ""extended universe"" for the rest of the series.  For example, Tom Sellick returns as Richard, Monica's dentist and ex-boyfriend.  Phoebe's family life becomes more complicated.  The chick and the duck appear as Chandler and Joey's pets.  We start to see behaviour that, on hindsight, foreshadow's the relationship between Monica and Chandler.  And, of course, Ross utters his famous catchphrase to justify why he slept with another girl when he was still in love with Rachel: ""We were on a break!""

There are some extremely funny episodes in Season 3.  I especially like the absurdity of the chick and the duck, the storyline of Monica's new boyfriend wanting to become the Ultimate Fighting champion, and Joey's new play (specifically, its self-absorbed director).  Unfortunately, the season spends far too much time on the Ross-Rachel soap opera storyline - the season bogs down for 4 or 5 episodes that are not particularly funny and feel manipulative (of the audience's emotions) on repeated viewings.  Perhaps it's just that I never invested much in the Ross-Rachel relationship because they were my least favourite characters in those seasons.  Not only that, the setup is artificial - we the audience never believe in the possibility of Rachel cheating on Ross with the cute guy at the office, and so have no patience with Ross's jealousy.

So, overall, this season is probably the definitive season of Friends.  Personally, however, I could have done with less soap opera and more comedy.",1145145600,,1593,5.034351145038168

1826623,5,B0000844MI,"Season Three is brilliant, starting off with Ross and Rachel in a healty relationship to them almost hating each other whilst still loving each other inside.

This season picks up where season two left off with Chandler and Janice hooking up again.  One of the themes in the beginning of this season is Joey's hate for Janice, at one time he describes it by saying ""When she laughs...it's like I want to tear my arm off so I have something to throw at her"".

Phoebe attempts to bond with her trailer trash half brother who thinks that she's a hooker at first.  Soon we get a flash back that takes us back to about 6 months before the Pilot of Season One.

After all of that Joey catches Janice kissing the husband she's supposed to be divorcing, Joey is faced with the task of telling his best friend Chandler, then Chandler must, again, break up with her.

This is when Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and meets Mark, a man who can get her a job at bloomingdale's.  Ross immediately assumes that Mark wants sex in exchange for the job and gets jelous.  Meanwhile Chandler is fooling around with Joey's sisters and forgetting which one.

Ross and Rachel's one year anniversary arrives, but when Rachel is forced to work late Ross brings a picnic to her work.  Rachel gets frustrated and insists that they take a break, when inside she doesn't want to.  Ross ends up going out with Joey and Chandler but yerns for Rachel, he calls to try to make up with her, but when he hears Mark over the phone he assumes the worst (Mark was really just giving Rachel advice).  Ross, depressed and thinking that Rachel is having sex with Mark, sleeps with the Xerox lady.  When Ross finds out the truth that Rachel did not sleep with Mark, they get back together.  Ross tries to cover up the fact that he slept with somebody else but Rachel finds out.

After a long fight they break up.

It then picks up with a bitter Ross and Rachel, still made at each other.  This is when Joey and Chandler buy a Chick and a Duck and Rachel dates a screaming crazy man in an attempt to get Ross Jelous.  In ends at the beach where Phoebe has found her birth mother and Ross is torn to decide between Rachel (who wants to hook up with him again) and his current girlfriend Bonnie.  He is standing between their doors.  The season ends with him opening one of the doors....

1826625,4,B0000844MI,"This season comes out with a whole lot of comedy. Already half-world-wide famous, Friends continues to make us laugh during its 3rd season. We get to see some really funny lines and some popular guest stars (Ben Stiller, Isebella Roselini), The after-effects of Richard and Monica's break-up, Ross and Rachel's relationship, Phoebe's 'Phobeisms' and Joey's discomforts toward Janice.

It's all like this: Monica can't sleep because of Richard, Phoebe tries to help her, Ross reveals a secret fantasy to Rachel, Joey wants to tear his arm off just so he has something to throw at Janice, resulting in-Joey and Janice's Day Of Fun.

I would like to admit (like many other fans) that I wanted to beat the hell out of the writer who decided to break-up Ross and Rachel. They actually broke them up! Why break them up if they're gonna end up together in the finale anyways?

Theres also a hint of CM here. In TOW All The Flashbacks, Chandler and Monica hug for many minutes, *cute, cute*.

The narrative anchor of the season is Ross' and Rachel's breakup.  Their conflicting anger and desire to get back together appear rhythically, right up to the season finale, 'The One at the Beach'.  Who was going to miss the fourth season after the brilliant ending, where Ross has to choose between Rachel - his forever love - and his beautiful latest fling, with her tragically shaved head?  In retrospect, his choice seems inevitable, but as Season Three closed down, they all had us guessing.

While Ross and Rachel are figuring themselves out, each of their fellow characters gains greater definition and new depths of humor.  We know them better now, and instantly catch every reference to their distinct packages of loopiness and obsession.

The writers must have known by this time what a winner they had, as well as how far to venture without ruining the recipe.  Their confidence shows.

By this season, FRIENDS felt to faithful viewers less like a promising sitcom and more like a slice of life, even of our own lives.

The One When No One's Ready- Everyone manages to be late on Ross's big night at a fundraiser. Joey and Chandler fight over a chair, and Monica is freaked out when she hears a message from Richard on her machine.

The One With the Giant Poking Device- Phoebe is afraid that her going to the dentist killed Ugly Naked Guy, and to prove it the gang creates a giant stick that they stretch from their balcony to Ugly Naked Guy's, and poke him. Chandler confronts Janice about her feelings for her ex-husband.

The One Where Monica and Richard Are Friends- Monica sees Richard again, and they briefly begin to date. Rachel agrees to read The Shining as long as Joey reads Little Women, and Chandler freaks when he sees Phoebe's new boyfriend, who has a problem with his shorts.

The One With the Hypnosis Tape- In order to stop smoking, Chandler uses a hypnosis tape meant for women which has some strange side effects. Phoebe is freaked out that her little brother wants to marry one of his teachers, a women twice his age. Monica considers dating a multi-millionair customer who has a crush on her.

The One With the Dollhouse- Monica and Ross's aunt dies, and Monica inherits a huge dollhouse, but Phoebe's ideas for it aren't exactly what she wants to do. Chandler has a bad date with Rachel's boss, and Joey sleeps with the leading lady in a play with him.

The One With a Chick and a Duck- After being forced to rollerskate at her job, Monica is delighted that her friend Pete buys her a restaurant. Joey decides to get a pet- a live little chicken that Chandler names Yasmine, after Yasmine Bleeth.

But of course to fans this season will always be known as the season where Ross and Rachel broke up. It was just so memorable and indelible that it echoes to the succeeding episodes of the season.

 Standouts episode are The One the Morning After (one of my all time favorites, Aniston and Schwimmer were just moving in here, and also the other four friends provide great comic support. Friends at its best), TOW Monica and Richard are just friends (this has always been one of my favorites, all the three storylines were great, but my favorite is the book swap with Joey and Rachel, both were hilarious especially Le Blanc), Tow the giant Poking Device (Perry and Kudrow stole the show), TOW No one's Ready (this is one of those episodes where it just gets better and better as you watch it), Tow the Frank Jr., TOW the Jam (Cox own this episode, very true to her character), Tow the Flashbacks, Tow the screamer, Tow the Chick and the duck, TOW the Ultimate Fighting Champion and TOW the Beach.

 One of the things that I love about the show is that all six characters have their share of character highs and lows, nobody dominates and actually runs the show, instead once in a while one character emerge as the strongest, but most of the time their complementing each other thus cementing their ensemble as one of the most effective and powerful ever.

Ross (David Schwimmer) becomes a really annoying, insensitive, whining weenie; couldn't the writers have come up with a more human, moving reason for his break-up with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston)?  Would a couple of single guys like Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) really lavish so much time and affection on a chick and a duck?  Does anything we see about Monica's (Courtney Cox) new boyfriend, Pete (Jon Favreau), account for his sudden, unquenchable desire to become the world's ultimate fighting champion?  No, but I guess the writers wanted to do an episode about ultimate fighting, so there we have it.

Friends fans, before you clobber me with ""unhelpful"" ratings, bear in mind that I did give this season 4 stars.  It is funny.  But I'm disappointed by what seems to me a consistent slide from an excellent first season in which the characters seemed more like real people than the average sitcom characters./",1116460800,,1150,5.021052631578947

1826689,5,B0000844MI,"""Friends"" first two seasons were a hoot, but their futures still have a long ways to go. NBC welcomed the actors back in September of 1996 with their third season that features more laughs, more tears, and more of our best friends.

Monica is utterly heartbroken after having to call off her relationship with Richard. She tries everything that could to get over him, but nothing works until her father comes over to help cheer her up. Chandler has realized that he is crazy about Janice and he promises to continue dating her, instead of dumping her. That is until Joey and Monica find Janice kissing her ex-husband. Chandler confronts her and then realizes that he does not want to stand in their way. So, he lets Janice give her ex-husband a second chance. Ross and Rachel continue to move on in their loving relationship, until a young man named Mark offers Rachel a job at Bloomingdales. Rachel gets the job, where she works as one of two assistants in purchasing. Mark is the other assistant, which sets off a jealous Ross. They argue about it constantly, until Rachel requests that they should take a break. Ross, thinking that she want to break up, goes off to a bar with Chandler and Joey. At this bar, Ross is seduced by Chloe, the girl who works at the copyplace. The next morning, Ross wakes up and receives a phone message from Rachel, apologizing for acting the way she did and wants to end their break and move on with their relationship. That is until Gunther, the geeky platinum blonde boss, who has a major crush on Rachel, spills the beans to Rachel about Ross' one-night stand. Rachel and Ross argue bitterly about it, leading into a heartbreaking ending to their relationship.

Monica happens to meet another guy named Pete Becker, who is a millionaire in the computer business. At first, Monica is not attracted to Pete. She likes Pete very much. She claims that Pete has everything she wants in a man, but she is somehow not attracted to him, until they have their first kiss. Their first kiss helped Monica become attracted to Pete. They date for awhile, but Monica breaks up with him when Pete decides that he cares more about becoming The Ultimate Fighting Champion, than he does of her.

Joey has not really gotten far with his acting career, since he had been fired from ""Days Of Our Lives"". He had gotten the male lead role in a play entitled, ""Boxing Day"". His co-star, Kate, who plays the female lead role, is dating the director, but she has feelings for Joey, but she hides them by being a b*tch.

Phoebe happens to meet her brother, Frank, Jr. Frank is a little out there, but he's a great younger brother. Phoebe cares for him deeply, which is why she becomes so crazed when she finds out that Frank, only 18 years old, is engaged to his high school Home Ec teacher, Alice Knight, who is at the age of 44. But Phoebe realizes that the two are in love, so she lets go. Not only does Phoebe find out about having a younger brother. She finds out that a friend of her mother's claims to know where her father is. Her mother's friend, whose name is also Phoebe, lives in Montak. Phoebe invites the gang down with her for the weekend. What Phoebe finds out that her mother is not her mother, but her stepmother. Her stepmother married her father. Phoebe's real mother is her stepmother's friend, Phoebe. At this time, Rachel begins flirting with Ross, acting like nothing had happened, acting like they never broke up. Ross has already started a relationship with a girl named Bonnie, who is friends with Phoebe. Bonnie used to shave her head quite often. Desperate to have Ross back, Rachel convinced Bonnie to shave her head again, hoping it will turn off Ross and send him running back to Rachel. Ross and Rachel talk about what she did to make Bonnie shave her head, until Rachel confesses that, ""I broke up with you because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you"". She realized it was true and they decided to get back together...after he ends his relationship with Bonnie.

There is more fun in this whole season. You have laughed yourselves to death with seasons one and two. Now, it's time to laugh yourself to death with season three. So, buy a copy of the complete third season. Remember, they'll be there for you. Guest stars include: Tom Selleck, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Christine Taylor, David Arquette, Ben Stiller, Elliott Gould, Christina Pickles, Jon Farveau, Giavanni Ribissi, Isabella Rossallini, & Teri Garr.

I THOUGHT IT WAS SO COOL THAT THE WRITERS WERE ABLE TO MAKE A WHOLE SHOW WORK ON ONE SET. EVERYONE HAD THEIR OWN THING GOING ON, YET THE ALL WORKED TOGETHER. THIS SEASON IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES...

1826692,5,B0000844MI,I love this season...I could watch it over and over!  This is the season where Rachel is pregnant and all of the drama that goes along with it.  Very few shows make me laugh out loud and this one definitely does!,1104796800,,212,4.146341463414634
1826693,5,B0000844MI,"This is the best Friends season ever! So I'll keep it nice and sweet...you just need to see it for yourself.

1826695,5,B0000844MI,"This season is by far the best in my book simply because of 3 episodes that prove the talents of the writers & the actors:

 1) The One Where No One's Ready-- Joey & his lunges bring great comedic relief while all of us can sympathize with either Ross or Rachel during their fight over whether Rachel's presence or her attire is more important. It's a fight that's realistic & brings you closer to the characters.

 2) The One Where Ross & Rachel Take A Break-- Your heart goes out to both of them. Rachel feels controlled & Ross feels unloved. You just want to give Ross a huge hug...until...

 3) The One With the Morning After-- This is by far the best episode of the season. Aniston & Schwimmer's acting as a duo is at its best. You really feel what they feel. And just when you feel like you can no longer hold the tears back, you crack up as the rest of the gang contemplates eating the ""organic"" wax for survival. Though I've seen the Finale, & know how everything ends, I cry everytime I watch this episode. (And believe me, I've watched it more than a few times.) You feel as if this could be your best friend, & you're watching her giving up with a broken heart & crushing her true love's heart with those 3 words that seem to bring such finality: ""You should go."" This episode brings a connection because it goes beyond laughs...it goes into tears. The actors feel it, so you can feel it.

 Without watching this season, you can never know the full humor of the phrase, ""We were on a break!"" The rest of the season may as well be lost on you.",1091145600,4,1553,4.258503401360544

1826697,5,B0000844MI,"I think that some of the episodes were not very funny in this season, but that didn't really matter to me.  What REALLY mattered were the story lines and the plot in each of the episodes.  Some of my favorite episodes in this season are:The One Where No One is Ready, The One With The Flashback, The One with the Race Car Bed, The One The Morning After...well there are way too many good ones to mention, because basically ALL the episodes in this season were REALLY REALLY good!  And Ross&Rachel were together for half of this season.  This is the season to buy if you are a ""Friends"" fan!",1088726400,,590,4.336363636363636
1826718,5,B0000844MI,"Friends has always been my favorite TV show, and when I found out there were going to be DVDs, I was thrilled. The COMPLETE THRID SEASON OF FRIENDS is the best DVD collection in the set.
Favorite episodes:
*The One With the Jam - Monica makes massive amounts of jam in this episode,  but the funniest part is when Joey sits there eating jam with a spoon - right out of the little jars. This isn't the best episode ever, but it's really funny.
*The One With the Giant Poking Device - The Friends think that Ugly Naked Guy is laying dead on the couch, but they don't want to tell the cops that ""The overweight naked guy we watch isn't moving"" so they tape together hundreds/thousands of chopsticks to poke him through an open window.
*The One Without the Ski Trip - The Friends decide to go on a ski trip,  but after a series of crappy events, they can't. They still have fun and cause endless laughter in the process.
These are just three of the funniest episodes out of 20-something. And that's just one season! Highly recommended to die hard Friends fanatics. The trivia game is also recommended.
Overall grade - A+",1083715200,,1116,4.439024390243903
1826719,5,B0000844MI,"Dont you think it strange that people never comment on the most charming asppect of Friends?  That is shows how people from multicultural backrounds can get along and be Friends.  I'll explain my theory.  Roz and Monica are Jewish, Chandler is the gay, Feeebee is European, i think French, Rachel is Hispanish, and Joey is Greek (I think, but I could be wrong on this one) yet they all get along and are friends.  You would think more people would have noticed this.
Oh, and buy Friends DVD season three on DVD!!!",1077148800,,513,4.543478260869565
1826720,5,B0000844MI,"I don't know how to describe this but at first I did not pay that much attention to Friends but then when an old friend told me about it and I started watching it, I got hooked and I saw the series upto the 9th and I bought the DVDs upto the fifth. I love  watching it and I watch it again and again and it does not lose its beauty and I laugh on it again and again. Thank you my old friend for showing this to me and let me get hooked to it.",1073692800,,442,3.6041666666666665
1826721,4,B0000844MI,"""Friends: The Complete Third Season"" has the show's producers committed to the idea that Ross and Rachel apart is funnier than Ross and Rachel together, an idea that is justified by ""The One where Ross & Rachel take a Break.""  But while that worked I can make an argument that season three was the weakest of the bunch, which might explain why season four was so great.  There are just too many episodes from this season that are not worth the effort (e.g., ""The One Where No One's Ready,"" ""The One with the Football"").  Part of the problem is the Rachel and Ross relationship dominates things to the point where everybody else ends up in the background, amply illustrated by ""The One Without the Ski Trip.""  Nobody else has a decent story arc, which is amply illustrated by the whole bit between Monica and Pete the millionaire.  Compare this with all the things they came up with for season four, and I can rest my case.
Best Episodes of the Third Season: ""The One With Frank Jr."" just for the ""freebie list"" (who did you put on your list?); ""The One With the Flashback"" where we learn what was happening with the gang right before the pilot episode; ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break"" just for the cosmic irony that the one time Ross gets lucky with another woman is during the infamous ""break"" (which was Rachel's idea); ""The One with the Morning After"" just to watch the Ross frantically trying to keep the secret from Rachel before we get to the inevitable pain of the breakup; ""The One with the Hypnosis Tape"" where Chandler tries to quit smoking, unaware his tapes are geared towards women; ""The One with the Screamer"" for the guest appearance of Ben Stiller as Tommy, Rachel's new boyfriend who has a bit of a temper problem; and ""The One at the Beach,"" more for Phoebe's meeting with an old friend of her mother (Teri Garr) than the strip ""Happy Days"" board game, but then there is also Rachel tricking Ross's girlfriend Bonnie to shaving her head.
Yes, part of what makes ""Friends"" work is the way all six have their characters down pat, but the series is at its best when there are story arcs that up the ante on their interactions.  Watching Ross and Rachel go down in flames is the defining story line of the third season, but there need to be more for this season to really click.  Besides, the Ross and Rachel thing was getting so old that it is no wonder that the Chandler-Joey-Kathy triangle the next year was so touching or that the Monica and Chandler relationship exploded and took over the series in season five.",1072656000,2,2542,4.51304347826087
1826722,5,B0000844MI,"The Third season of Friends would always be remembered as the year Ross and Rachel broke up,showing that the writers would shake up the show to keep it fresh and on it's feet.
 In this season,the ups and downs of love effects the other characters. Monica's heartbreak after the break up with Richard,Chandler's short term relationship with Janice,Lothario Joey falling for his play's co-star(Dina Meyer),and even Phoebe reunites with her musical partner(E.G. Daily).
 The best episodes includes The One with The Princess Leia Fantasy,..Where No One's Ready(Going Commando),..with the Flashback,...the Giant Poking Device,...the Football, .. where Chandler can't Remember which Sister,..without the Ski Trip,and..Ultimate Fighting Champion.
 The unofficial two part The One where Ross and Rachel Take a Break/ the Morning After was the high point of the season in which Ross and Rachel take a break,only to  break up when Ross spends the night with Chloe,""The copy girl"".The episode includes some of the funniest moments as well as the most heartbreaking.",1067990400,3,1054,5.487654320987654

This season begins with Chandler and Janice getting back together and Monica mourning over her break-up with Richard and ends with the gang kicking back at the beach for the weekend, where many surprises await them.  This is defintely a DVD to add to your Friends collection.  I have absolutely no complaints for this DVD. The third season of Friends brings us many laughs, such as when Joey builds the entertainment unit and Chandler hates it and eventually gets his arm stuck to the side of it, and when Joey and Chandler get a chick and a duck.  Season 3 also made us cry, such as when Ross and Rachel broke up in the one with The Morning After.",1066003200,2,691,4.504

Plus, the DVD sound is amazing, there have been 0 blips or snags in the picture so far, and the extra time added to most episodes and the additional commentary allow even the most friends savvy fan will get something new here.  This set even had two episodes I had never seen on tv (and that seems near impossible all considered).

At this point, the whole series seems a bit surreal, quite distanced from reality TV, let alone reality.
This kind of escapism was fun in the first few years, like Ally McBeal and other series, but I probably have moved on more than the show has. Which is why I recommending watching the HBO series with Parker, they are not in a state of stasis like this show is.",1056585600,,540,4.303921568627451

It doesn't seem to be considered that by others, however, I just couldn't stop laughing while watching this season.  To save you the time of reading the rest of this if you just want a brief interview, the bottom line is that this season is very hilarious and yet at the same time there are plenty of moments that will have you in tears as well.  A definite must for Friend's fans!!!

1826778,4,B0000844MI,"Probably my favorite overall season of Friends - Phoebs finds her brother and her mom, Chandler jokes about dating Monica, Ross blows it with Rachel, who in turn ""balds"" a potential girlfriend, Joey hits on a woman who he thinks lives in ""Neverland"" while the friends play football.
We get to tour Joey and Chandler's apartment in the ""extras"" section of the DVD ... but, other than that, pretty slim on the extras.  Maybe the team that makes the DVD's is wondering how they're gonna fill the other 7 DVD seasons with stuff.
In short - yeah, you gotta get this to complete the growing collection, just watch for the cut scenes (or bits of scenes) and listen to the editorial comments over the shows you've already memorized and you'll have a great time hanging wiht your Friends.

The third season has so many excellent episodes I could never pick a favorite one. During the season Ross and Rachel are together and for the first 2 years viewers had been waiting for this but our freinds would never stay together. Meanwhile the rest of the gang has problems that a hilariously written into the episodes.
Bottomline:  Friends on DVD is so comforting knowing that if you ever need a freind or someone to cheer you up, just pop in the DVD, get some ben and jerry's cookie dough ice cream (or your prefered flavor) and watch!",1049846400,,647,4.52991452991453
1826781,5,B0000844MI,"Definitely one of the best and most exciting seasons of Friends, it's the season where Ross and Rachel are; still dating, break-up, and eventually decide to get back together by the season's end. In between lots of events take place, e.g. Monica gets a new boyfriend (Pete the millionaire) and Joey &Chandler buy birds (a chick and a duck). The season features some of the all-time favourite Friends episodes! I love the packaging! You take it out of the cover and the DVD version is like a folder. It opens up into like 6 pages with the DVDs and episodes listings. I got this for a more expensive price so this price is a lot better! You can also choose to have subtitles (choice is from 4 different languages) or you can choose to have none.

You can take in an Open house at Joey and Chandler's Bachelor Pad with the interactive menu (you can even flip through a 'Friends' scrap book). 2nd- you can leaf through the Friends of Friends Guest book (e.g. Billy Crystal). 3rd- You can learn what's up with your friends with video guides. 4th- You can do a Rachel-Ross trivia quiz: every right answer brings them closer to each other and every wrong answer moves them apart.
I highly recommend this season. Not only is the season extremely funny but also I love the packaging and everything. The episodes also have extra footage that you've never seen. Every episode has at least 1 line that had to be cut-off because of limited time when it was aired.",1049846400,54,5359,4.545548654244306

1826783,4,B0000844MI,"I adore ""Friends"", and Season Three is one of my favorites.  This DVD would be five stars if not for the production quality of the DVD itself.
First, the honestly bad stuff -- two of the disks had major problems.  When you try to access the shows from the ""whole episode"" button on the episode list, the DVD plays the teaser, ""preview"" scene instead.  It's only on a few episodes and can be worked around (the whole episode is there, you just can't get there from the menu), but it's annoying.
Several episodes had problems with pixellation or skipping, and the beginning of the first episode (where the cast comes into Central Perk and finds the show's writers in their seats) is unwatchable, and will dump you back to the DVD menu if not fast-forwarded through.  I examined the disks carefully, and couldn't find any dust or scratches that would explain this... it had *just* arrived in the mail and had never been out of its case before.
This is just a nitpick, but... for me, these disks would be much more enjoyable to view if you could skip *scenes* -- especially the fountain-dancing credit sequence, which can get old after many episodes at once -- with the ""chapter"" button.  As it is, pressing the chapter button takes you to the next episode.
Like other reviews have commented, the ""Special Features"" on these DVD's are a little disappointing... especially if, like me, you're spoiled rotten by the wealth of cool inside information usually contained in DVD features.  Every feature is almost entirely clip montages of scenes already on the disk.  Season Three contains an ""exploration"" of Joey and Chandler's apartment... (A still picture with bits that light up, just like the ones of Central Perk and Monica and Rachel's on Seasons One and Two) with some tiny commentary from the crew.
The commentary from the producers on three episodes (The One With The Football, The One With The Morning After, The One Where No One's Ready) is the only real addition, but doesn't really provide much insight.  It's more like:
Marta:  Oh, Jennifer is great in this scene.
David:  Oooh, isn't she?
Marta:  Who wrote this episode?
David:  I don't remember.
Marta:  Well, it's funny.
David:  Yeah, it is.
Marta:  Oh, it's raining!  I love when we make it rain!
David:  It's so cool that we can do that.
Occasionally, they'll talk about something interesting (how they built the set for ""The One With The Football"", why characters had to be wearing certain costumes for technical reasons, or what was going on in real life that inspired a subplot) but mostly, it's just them chatting to each other.
These DVD's are worth it just to be able to watch this amazing show whenever you like, but as DVD's, they're a bit of a letdown.",1049587200,,2723,4.710970464135021
1826784,5,B0000844MI,"Friends is by far one of my favourite TV sitcoms. It's funny and just sooooo entertaining. I could watch it over and over and over again and still get a kick out of it. Season three is one of the funniest Friends seasons, and for that alone, I would buy this DVD boxed set, but there is just soooooo much more. There is at least a few minutes of never before seen footage in each episode, there is the tour of Joey and Chandler's bachelor pad, commentary on three episodes (TOW No One's Ready, TOW All The Football and TOW The Morning After), you can preview each episode before watching it with the special previewing feature, you get a ""best of"" part with greatest moments of each memeber of Friends during the season and so much more.

Everything was ok except that Disk One and Three are the same one.  Disk Three is really Disk One and Disk One is ok.  All have different cover labels but in reality I have two Disk Ones.  So I went back and they told me they had a similar problem yesterday with another customer.  I think someone who's in charge of labeling the DVDs made a mistake and had them all shipped having no Disk 3.  I don't know how many DVDs are affected but everyone should check Disk 3 to make sure it is in fact disk 3.  Especially if you live in the Los Angeles area because that's where I live so check and keep your receipt.

Watching these Season Three episodes again on DVD reminded me that this was the year when you really got to know the gang.  You knew this show was something special and would be around for years to come.
In a season of many highlights, however, two of the absolute standouts are ""The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break"" and ""The One with the Morning After.""  The emotions they both displayed during their all-night ""breakup"" were so real and believable.  And they introduced a new phrase into the TV lexicon...""WE WERE ON A BREAK!""
My thanks to Warner Bros. for offering complete seasons on DVD (the ""Best of Friends"" series just weren't enough) but why the long delays between releases?!  If seasons 1-8 were all out on DVD right now, I'd put down the money and buy them all in one shot!",1049241600,,1060,4.523560209424084

1826798,5,B0000844MI,"The third season of Friends is most notable for the breakup of the Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) relationship that had been a large part of the first two seasons.  As with most TV shows, complacency is the quickest root to cancellation, so the instead of keeping the two together, they break them up.  During the course of the first half of the season Rachel leaves her job as a waitress and meets a good looking guy, Mark (Steven Eckholdt, who now stars on My Big Fat Greek Life), who helps get her a job a Bloomingdale's.  Ross is immediately jealous as he says to Rachel no guy helps a girl just out of the goodness of his heart.  Rachel thinks he is being ridiculous and Ross' impending jealousy puts a strain on their relationship.  The breaking point comes when Rachel tells Ross she has to cancel their anniversary plans because she has to work late, he shows at her office with a picnic style dinner.  Rachel is incensed and she says they should take a break. Ross goes to a party with Joey (Matt LeBlanc) & Chandler (Matthew Perry) and ends up sleeping with Chloe (Angela Featherstone) a  girl who works at a copier store that both Joey and Chandler have the hots for.  Ross tries to hide the affair from Rachel, but eventually she finds out from Gunther (James Michael Tyler), which to an all-night fight that ends up with Rachel leaving Ross.  Ross explains his infidelity by saying ""we were on a break"", which would become a much repeated line that would surface in most subsequent seasons.  The rest of the season deals with the breakup until the season ending episode where the gang goes to the beach in search of Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) father and Ross finds out that Rachel still has feelings for him.  While the main plot line is the Ross-Rachel relationship, there are plenty of other great episodes including a flashback episode where we go back to a time set one year before the series began, the introduction of the duck & chick into Chandler & Joey's apartment, a hilarious Thanksgiving episode in which Monica's (Courtney Cox) and Ross' old sibling rivalry comes out in a touch football game, Ben Stiller has a great guest spot as a new boyfriend of Rachel's who screams at Ross and no one believes him about it, Chandler starts smoking again and an episode where he uses a hypnosis tape to help him quit, but it is geared towards women and an early season episode that shows the true greatness of the show  in which the entire episode is spent with Ross trying get everyone ready for an important banquet.  It shows the subtly and genius of the actors and writers to take such a simple plot and expand it out over the course of a half-hour with hilarious results.  Season three is bogged down a bit by the heaviness of the breakup and also a ridiculous plot line involving Monica and Pete (Jon Favreau).  Monica first meets Pete at a diner she is working at and doesn't think much of him, but she goes out with even though she's not all that interested.  It turns out that Pete is a software mogul who incredibly rich.  She dates him and when Monica thinks he's bought her a ring, it turns out he is going to fulfill his dream by entering the extremely violent Ultimate Fighting Championship.  The relationship doesn't really click at all from the start and the ridiculous fighting championship plot is not up the usual high standards of the show.

By the time they return to the beach, Chandler looks so much happier and healthier.  I will take ""fat"" Chandler over emaciated Chandler any day.  Here in Japan we are up to season 7 on DVD (because it is not broadcast, DVD is the only way to see this show - and hear what all of the Friends sound like in Japanese!) and this season leaves me a bit uncomfortable.

1826804,5,B0000844MI,"I think it is safe to say that I'm a `Friends' fanatic. I've sat glued to the telly through seven seasons and laughed through over one hundred and fifty episodes. So now I want to share my love of this fantastic programme with my fellow Amazainians.
`Friends' is an American sitcom about six friends in their early thirties living in New York. The comedy shows them struggle with their careers and ill-fated romances, but they always have their friends to be there for them at the end of the day, which is what the show is all about. The programme is as near to perfect as television gets - hilarious scripts, incredible acting, and not to mention an amazing theme song by the Rembrants, `I'll Be There For You'.
So who are the six friends that make this show what it is?
MONICA:
Courtney Cox plays Monica Geller, the Mother hen of the group. She is incredibly competitive and more than just a little neurotic - she is obsessed with cleaning and keeping order. As a child she was a bit of a compulsive eater, and consequently became extremely overweight, but after hearing Chandler calling her fat as a teenager she took it upon herself to lose the extra pounds (about a hundred of them!). Her love of food inspired her to become a chef, although her career is rather shaky in earlier series. Monica seems to have an attraction for the wrong type of men, which doesn't really help her desire for marriage and a family. However, she found true love at last with Chandler, and season seven ends with their wedding.
ROSS:
David Schwimmer plays Ross Geller, Monica's geeky elder brother. After doing well at high school and college he became a palaeontologist, and later a professor at New York University. He is a family man at heart, but isn't very good at marriage. His first wife left him ... not for another man, but for another woman! His second marriage didn't work out because he said the wrong name at the alter, and his third marriage to Rachel was only the result of a drunken night in Las Vegas and they were divorced soon after. Oh well, perhaps if he keeps trying he'll get there in the end!
RACHEL:
Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green, who is a bit of a Barbie-doll (in a nice way) and was very spoilt by her father. She ditched her dentist fianc Barry at the alter because he looked like `Mister Potato Head' and went to live with her old high school best friend Monica instead. Rachel then got her first ever job as a waitress in the coffee house where the friends hang out, `Central Perk'. She's gone up in the world a lot since then and currently works for Ralph Lauren, where she has her own personal assistant Tag (who she not-very-professionally dated!). Rachel and Ross have an on and off relationship throughout the show, but viewers are still waiting to find out if they ever get back together again.
CHANDLER:
Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing, a wisecracking computer programmer. Still mentally scarred by his childhood when he discovered his parents were getting divorced because his father was gay, he is, like Monica, very neurotic but covers his hang-ups by joking. He too has had many relationship difficulties, mostly because he always found nothing but flaws in all the women he dated. Now he has found happiness with Monica, his first successful relationship, and she has succeeded in bringing out the more mature, emotional side to his character. Ahhh.
PHEOBE:
Lisa Kudrow plays Pheobe Buffay, the hippy folksinger who plays her guitar in the coffee house singing (badly) ridiculous songs like `Smelly Cat'. Pheobe is a masseur, hates her furniture to be mass-produced and often believes she is in contact with her dead grandmother. Ok, so she is pretty weird, but that's hardly surprising considering the upbringing she has had. When Pheobe was only fourteen, her adopted mother committed suicide by putting her head in an oven, and left Pheobe and her twin sister to look after themselves. But considering all that she nearly always manages to have a smile on her face.
JOEY:
Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribbiani, an American-Italian actor who is unemployed the majority of the time and yet still thinks he's `all that'. He found his five minutes of fame as Doctor Drake Ramoray on `Days of our Lives', but his character was killed off by falling down an elevator shaft. He's a bit of a stud when it comes to women, and practically brings a different girl back to his apartment every night. He shared an apartment with Chandler for a few years, although most of the time he couldn't afford to pay his half and borrowed the money from Chandler. Joey doesn't have much in the way of brains or cash, but he's certainly very loveable!
Those are the six main characters, and together they make up one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. Every episode has it's own unique shine to it, and I'm usually in stitches all the way through. Definitely a TV show you don't want to miss!",1045094400,2,4907,4.647871116225547
