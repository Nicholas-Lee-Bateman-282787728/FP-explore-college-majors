7883666,2,6305131341,"Cynthia Khan starred in a number of contemporary Hong Kong kung fu crime thrillers (e.g. IN THE LINE OF DUTY 3, 4 & 5), most of which were better than LADY HUNTER (aka MADAME CITY HUNTER, 1993). Here she plays a policewoman who is framed by the notorious Five Fingers gang for the murder of five drug-addicted teens. While trying to clear herself and bring the gang down, she also has to contend with her father's impending marriage to a much younger woman and former gang moll. The crime story is undercut by massive infusions of shrill and witless ""comedy,"" although there are some choice bits of action. There's a great opening battle in an abandoned building that ends with Cynthia standing on the roof facing down her opponent, who opens his coat to reveal he's strapped with bombs. Unfazed, Cynthia deftly kicks him off the roof and watches calmly as he explodes a few stories down. Such inspired moments are few and far between, however. Some other good performers are on hand, including HK mainstay Anthony Wong (BEAST COPS) and former kung fu femme Kara Hui Ying Hung (MY YOUNG AUNTIE), but this one's strictly for Cynthia Khan completists.",990921600,3,1149,4.75
