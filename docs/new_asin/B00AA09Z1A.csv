I would like to thank the supplier again for making a sucker out of me. The presentation of the box seems legitimate, however upon closer inspection this was burned, printed and shipped from someone's basement. All 22 episodes on one disc... this was due to far below average quality (bitrate) of the video/audio. Upon watching it, it became clear that this was simply recorded from the television airing of the show, hence the news flashes from the local area. This is really only worth $5.95... I paid the full price of a brand new (authentic) box set. Never again... Ever",1357776000,5,691,4.626016260162602
