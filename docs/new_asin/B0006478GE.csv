I bet you can count at least five of them. Now if your interested

in a checking out new ones and you haven't bought any new dvd's lately try SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.This offering has something for everyone.

This dvd is a great collection of music with great artist!

I think any one would be hard pressed to beat this collection

for the price.

If you can find better music dvd collection please let me know.  ,Thanks Thomas 7/06",1153785600,2,544,4.434343434343434
