2693846,5,B000KLQUSK,"You probably already know this show and its premise.  The third season is a turning point.  To a large degree, Jeannie sheds her harem costume for normal clothes (BTW, this season was filmed in color, as was the second.  But the coloring here seems to be very brilliant--it really stands out and grabs your attention.) My goodness, that woman is pleasing to the eye!  Nevertheless, the fact that Jeannie is clad in regular clothes allows for a whole new type of episode.  The change is greater than when Roger found out that Tony has a genie. No longer is she stuck at home, periodically popping in at NASA, but she is out-and-about, meeting and interacting with people and being a major figure in most of the sketches.

Jeannie's evil sister is introduced this season and that opens up a whole new range of problems.  Also, in this season, the show seems to have 'arrived,' as it landed a number of guest appearances from well-known celebrities, including Milton Burle, Bob Denver, and the pop duo Boyce and Hart.

If you liked this show when you were growing up, you'll love it again.  However, please do not try to find any hidden meaning to life's problems in this show.  It was designed to be silly and whacky!  IT'S A FANTASY!!  Please keep that in mind when you watch OR REVIEW this show!",1170201600,34,1295,4.582608695652174
2693847,4,B000KLQUSK,"When I was growing up, I used to wait for these episodes to show up in repeats.

I always thought it was odd that when Tony finally figured out the safe's combination at the end of Part 4, he said it out loud a couple of times, with his mouth obscured, and in a voice that sounded ""off"" somehow. Later in life, I learned that the network had run a contest in conjunction with these episodes, asking viewers to guess the combination. The winning combination was dubbed in later, so as not to encourage any ""leaks.""

I've seen scripts from the promo spots for this contest that ran during the series' original airing. Too bad they couldn't have at least included those spots in this package.

Alas.",1170115200,5,696,4.464566929133858
2693848,5,B000KLQUSK,"UPDATE:

 Sony should recall this set because there are a few major problems with the set. First of all I thought that I had a bad set and was going to return it.. but then I saw from other reviews that other people was having trouble as well. The episode ""Bootsie Nightengale"" is very jittery and jumpy throughout the last 15-20 minutes of the show.

I didn't know what to think was the problem, and thought it was possibly my dvd player going bad or faulty discs and I reset the dics over and it happened again on the same spot. I was just going to return it when I looked this up online and seen that this is one of the problems with the set.

There is also a mistake on the cover art also because it sais that episode #13 ""My Son The Jeannie"" is on disc 3 but if you play disc 3 it is no where to be found because it is on disc 2 instead. How did Sony pull a mistake like that??

This set is still worth buying if you are a true Jeannie fan but fer shame on Sony for releasing a set with so many mistakes! On the other hand all of the other episodes on this set have very good picture quality and are overall great episodes to watch and enjoy.

I just wished the guys at Sony would have put the same thought and effort in to this set as they did ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" Season one and two box sets.

2693849,5,B000KLQUSK,"The first time I met Barbara Eden, I told her how much I love Jeannie's sister (who's name is also Jeannie, by the way) and she told me that she absolutely LOVED playing the sister.

She said she thought playing the sister was so much fun and I think you can really tell in her performance.

My favorite episode of the entire 5 seasons is on this disc - the third episode of the Moon safe saga, which I had named as a child, ""Bagdad Harem"". Even though its in the same season, Jeannie's sister has a totally different master in this episode than in the episode where we first meet her. Its just one of the funny little inconsistencies that seems to be typical of the entire series, but that's part of its charm, too.

Overall, this is a great season and I can honestly say I have been waiting for this season to come out on DVD for years! Can't wait for it to arrive in the mailbox!",1164758400,14,882,4.176470588235294

2693891,4,B000KLQUSK,"If you loved the first two seasons, you will love the third season with the same cast members. Barbara Eden gets better playing both Jeannie and her devious lookalike sister in this season. Larry Hagman is back as Major Anthony Nelson, the astronaut. Bob Daily is back as his colleague and best friend, Major Roger Healey. Hayden Rorke as the bewildered psychiatrist Dr. Bellows and more. Guest appearances include Milton Berle, Don Rickles, Bob Denver, Paul Lynde, Mike Farrell and more. Emmaline Henry plays Mrs. Bellows.

I found the third season far more interesting and developed than the first two seasons combined. In this season, they travel to Hawaii on location for a few episodes with Milton Berle and Don Ho playing himself. Bob Denver is memorable as the son of Jeannie's Hajj. Paul Lynde is always a delight in an episode. The episodes have developed the relationship between Master and Jeannie more as equals. While I dread her calling him master, Jeannie comes into her own person and rightfully so on the advent of women's liberation.

I enjoyed the third season where I felt the cast was finally comfortable with their characters. My only complaint about this DVD set is the lack of features with regards to the series. The four part episode where Jeannie gets locked in a safe lasts as long with a surprising but predictable ending. Barbara Eden doesn't get the respect and accolades. She appears effortless in playing Jeannie I and Jeannie 2. Larry Hagman is also wonderful as Major Nelson, the American astronaut. In this season, Major Nelson and Major Healey are planning to go to the moon in a spaceship. At the time in history, man did not go to the moon until 1969.

This series especially the third season is still funny and enjoyable for audiences of all ages. I grew up watching episodes in syndication during my summers. Now, I can watch it anytime on DVD.  The DVD set comes with no extra footage, bloopers, or special features like movies. Too bad, I would have enjoyed learning more about that time on television.",1448236800,,2045,4.801136363636363

2693931,5,B000KLQUSK,"I enjoy watching reruns from some of the TV shows from many years ago. Some TV shows from yesteryear are much better than some of the ones made today. ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has always been one of my favorite comedies. It doesn't hurt that Barbara Eden played Jeannie. She was smokin' hot and incredibly sexy in her little Jeannie outfit so men love watching her, but the show was tastefully made so that it is pleasant for women and children to watch. When I saw that Amazon had the entire series, I purchased all five seasons. Even though I have not had the time to watch every episode, I have watched at least two episode of every season. Even though they are not as high resolution as Blu-rays are today and considering that most of these episodes originally aired in the late 1960s, they are remarkably sharp. I'm glad I purchased the B&W first season because I wanted them as they are were originally made. The colors in the Seasons 2-5 discs are well saturated, but might be off just a touch. After watching several episodes throughout the entire series, I believe they are the same as I have always seen on reruns without any edits. I have not noticed any differences. Since I know what these are like and if I didn't already own these, I would buy the entire series from Amazon. They are a great value for the price.",1417219200,,1323,4.448559670781893

2693983,5,B000KLQUSK,"As a child, I loved the entire ""I Dream of Jeannie"" series, but ""Jeannie Goes To Honolulu,"" season 3, episode 18, will always have a special place in my heart:

As a girl of seven years, my grandpa took my grandmother, mother, and me to Hawaii for vacation where we stayed on the Western end of Waikiki in the fabulous, then only three year old Ilikai Hotel.  Imagine my delight when, noticing camera crews, I turned to see Barbara Eden as ""Jeannie"" wearing a straw hat with a bird of paradise flourish, rise up from behind a flowering bush.  It was only take #1, so we got to see it a few more times before it was deemed a wrap.  My favorite show was filming right there in the hotel where we were staying!  ""Jeannie's"" motion as she rose from behind the bush would be edited out, we were told, so it would appear as if she'd just suddenly blinked in.  I'll never forget standing next to Ms. Eden outside the pool lounge, gazing up anonymously in secret admiration for her, as she spoke with some other adults.  In her high heels, she seemed exceedingly tall to my seven-year-old mind, her blonde hair beautifully coiffed, her nose perfectly turned-up, and her eyelashes, long and thick, like canopies over her sparkling blue eyes.  To this day, I'm certain she is the most perfectly glamorous creature I've ever seen in person!

The next day at the pool, we watched as producers tied and re-tied bailing wire onto a pool lounge chair.  This, we were told, would be used to pull the chair, with actor Larry Hagman as Major Anthony Nelson, into the pool when Eden blinked.

For all the excitement we had on our Hawaiian trip -- luaus, pontoon rides, volcano visits, etc. -- the whole ""Jeannie"" thing stands out for me above all.  It was beautifully capped off on our last day there, by a chance meeting with Hagman in the lobby where he posed with me for a photo and, pleased to hear of my devotion to his show, slapped his stetson on my head as we traveled up together in the elevator.  There were many nice things said of Hagman upon his recent passing.  Having met him just that once, I can completely understand why everyone so adored this affable, easy-going fellow.  If he did nothing else in his life, he once made a seven year old girl ecstatically happy!

Do definitely dream a little dream of ""Jeannie goes to Honolulu!""",1354665600,2,2330,4.485781990521327
2693984,4,B000KLQUSK,"The third season of I Dream of Jeannie (1967-68) is a turning point for the series, as the stories becomes more outrageous, and the program becomes even more of a far flung fantasy.  Creator Sidney Sheldon had written nearly all of episodes the previous year, but for this season, various writers combined to produce the episodes.  With a whole new creative force, and apparently very few restrictions on what is possible, the results are stories that explore completely new comedic realms for the series, which heads more in the direction of Bewitched, the show that inspired Sheldon to create Jeannie.

The core of the series remains intact, but there are some noticeable changes.  Jeannie (Barbara Eden) is still in love with her master, Air Force Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), but with Tony not actively dating, she doesn't push too hard to get married, and things are relatively peaceful at home.  Tony and his best friend, Major Roger Healey (Bill Daily), are attached to NASA, and stationed at Coco Beach, Florida, training to be astronauts, although by the end of the season, they seem to spend little time trying to get into space.

The strange events that surround Tony, don't seem to bother Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) they way they used to.  Usually Bellows is the only superior officer around, leaving Tony and Roger with a free hand most of the time.  Bellows' wife Amanda (Emmaline Henry) also becomes more prominent, bringing an interesting and offbeat spin to the proceedings.

Taking another page from Bewitched, where Elizabeth Montgomery occasionally assumed a dual role, Barbara Eden also plays a second character in five episodes, appearing as her sister Jeannie #2, who has dark hair, a green harem costume, and similar designs on Major Nelson's affections.  Incorporating even more physical comedy into his role, Larry Hagman remains simply terrific.  Bill Dailey is very steady as Roger, who is a bit more goofy, constantly spilling the beans.

With so many creative forces at work, the atmosphere becomes more surreal, as series loses some of the cohesiveness it had when Sheldon was in complete control.  With a younger generation of writers involved, the stories incorporate more modern and ""hip"" cultural elements, reflecting a slightly more liberal attitude.  The program has some big name guest stars, like Milton Berle, Don Rickles, and Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island).  There is also some traveling involved, as three stories are shot on location in Hawaii, and another is set England.  The music is jazzed up a bit, and emphasized to a greater degree, and the show continues to feature oversized sets, where the cast appear to look very tiny.

Pop music comes into play for one of the few times, in ""Jeannie, the Hip Hippie"", where Jeannie puts together a musical group for one of Amanda's events.  Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, authors of hit songs for The Monkees, and record producer and now convicted felon, Phil Spector, guest star.  For total escapism, there is ""My Master, The Ghost Breaker"", where Tony, Jeannie, and Roger, toddle off to England for a spooky adventure in a haunted castle.  There's a crisis at home, in ""Divorce, Genie Style"", where Jeannie temporarily loses her powers, and Amanda Bellows believes that Tony has been keeping her as a slave.

The four part adventure ""Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?"" is much too long, but has some funny moments, as Jeannie is accidentally locked inside a safe bound for the moon.  ""Here Comes Bootsy Nightingale"" has a familiar story, where Carol Wayne is terrific playing an actress appearing at a show, where Tony assigned as her escort.  Jeannie's sister makes her fifth appearance in ""Operation: First Couple On the Moon"", as one of two women training with Roger and Tony for a moon mission.  One of three episodes set in Hawaii, ""The Greatest Con Man in the World"" features Milton Berle swapping some worthless land for Jeannie's priceless jewel.

How far training has fallen by the wayside is explored in two different episodes, written by the same writer.  In ""Don't Feed The Astronauts"", Paul Lynde makes his third appearance in the series, as an expert who puts the guys through a survival test on a deserted island.  Similarly in ""My Master, The Weakling"", Roger and Tony are assigned to train under a strict trainer (Don Rickles), who Jeannie gives the personality of his doting aunt, as war games are underway.

With Sidney Sheldon turning loose the reigns, I Dream of Jeannie takes off on far ranging flights of comedic fancy in its third season.  The wild escapades don't always strike comedic gold, but there are still lots of laughs, as the program would continue to become more and more outrageous, throughout the remainder of its run.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is very good for a program of this age, although unfortunately there are no bonus features.",1339200000,,4878,4.957002457002457

2694009,4,B000KLQUSK,"I purchased a few of these season when they were on sale and was disappointed to find that ALL the sets had foggy/cloudy substances on the discs. It didn't cause any issues on my player. They all played flawlessly, in fact. But when I brought them over to my friends house the other day, his player couldn't read the discs AT ALL. Apparently, not all players can read through the cloudy substance. Since all the three seasons I bought had this issue, then requesting a replacement would be futile since I'm just going to end up with same issue again with the replacement. So, I decided not to exchange. Looks like they all were manufactured this way.

I've bought many other DVD sets by Sony, such as Bewitched and The Three Stooges and all those discs are immaculate! But with I Dream of Jeannie, it's all fogged up! For some reason, the quality control on the Jeannie DVDs is lacking, which is very disappointing. Someone posted this same problem on the Season 1 DVD set, so I know there are MANY batches out there with this issue.

Overall, this is my favorite season of Jeannie, but I just thought you all should know that playback issues may be a possible problem for you if you decide to buy these.",1290124800,,1204,4.493150684931507

2694011,5,B000KLQUSK,"I Dream of Jeannie has always been one of my favorite shows.  I was a kid when it was on the network, back in 1965.  However, this Third Season collection is from 1967-1968. The show has easily-accessible features and episode lists.  The digitization is good, considering it's only a DVD, and not a Blu-ray Disc.  Several fun episodes, including the 4-Part episode: ""Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?"" where Jeannie accidentally gets locked in a moon safe;  ""The Greatest Con Artist in the World,"" with Milton Berle, to name a few.  For being over 40 years old, the color is still as vivid as ever.  The young Barbara Eden is as beautiful as ever.  If you're looking to expand your collection of classic TV shows, this is certainly on the list.

The only glitch I noticed, is the episode ""My Son, the Genie,"" with Bob Denver is on disc 2, but is listed as the first episode on disc 3.

2694014,4,B000KLQUSK,"I Dream of Jeannie is a very fun watch, especially this season. It was very entertaining with some good plots. I felt though that the order of the episodes made no sense. I have a gripe with two episodes: Here Comes Bootsie Nightingale and Jeannie Goes to Honolulu. Here Comes Bootsie Nightingale was OK, but the actress could have been WAY better. The thing I really don't like is that the picture seems to be bouncing from 12:00-16:00. This is very irritating. Jeannie Goes to Honolulu must be the WORST EPISODE of the whole series. Nine whole minutes of the episode were of a stupid Don Ho music video. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but the song picked was awful. The video was so annoying. It was of Don Ho just walking around holding a boys hand with Jeannie dancing annoyingly in the background.
My advice is to get a VHS of the Bootsie episode, then put it on your computer. Also, copy all the episodes to your computer. Use it to make a new order of episodes using the VHS version of Bootsie. A good episode order would be:
1. Jeannie or the Tiger
2. Fly Me to the Moon
3. My Turned-On Master
4. Jeannie, the Hip Hippie
5. Everybody's a Movie Star
6. Who Are You Calling a Jeannie?
7. Meet My Master's Mother
8. Operation: First Couple on the Moon
9. Haven't I Seen Me Someplace Before
10. Jeannie and the Great Bank Robbery
11. My Master, the Ghostbreaker

14. The Battle of Waikiki

17. Please Don't Feed the Astronauts

If you have never seen this before you are missing ALOT.

I love the fact that this is innocent yet sexy.
The costumes are eye candy and the special effects were great for its day.
But most importantly it is HILARIOUS how Jeannie is always getting into one mess after the other often getting Major Nelson into trouble.

Jeannie's charachter is naive, yet smart, sexy and overly jealous of her Master(who freed her by the way when he opened that bottle).

Major Nelson is handsome, and good hearted and is finally learning that he cant control Jeannie but he still takes her for granted.

Major Healy is his selfish yet lovable best friend(who knows about Jeannie).

Dr Bellows is the military space base psychiatrist who is always getting into trouble with all the Generals because he cant prove something is amiss with Major Nelson.

This season Jeannie's evil sister Jeannie shows up and creates even more chaos.

This is simply the best sitcom to ever hit the TV screen.

2694036,5,B000KLQUSK,"Over forty years later this show is still a charmer!  Growing up I mostly watched Bewitched because my parents found it more ""family-oriented"".  Though Jeannie is a clean cut show, I think they were still jittery about the idea of a blonde running around in a skimpy harem costume and living with an astronaut she wasn't married to.  But now that I'm all grown up, I find I Dream of Jeannie a little more fun than Bewitched.  Jeannie, Maj Nelson, Maj. Healy and poor Dr. Bellows get mixed up in these wacky little capers and manage to untangle themselves out of it later on.  All the actors are comic naturals.  The show is not afraid to bring in the hip and swinging scene with beautiful girls.  I'm sure this was the best way for young models of the day to get introduced onscreen.  I Dream of Jeannie is light and optimistic:  you have a playful genie and adventurous astronauts.  With Bewitched, there are traditions, spells, protocol, moral and family obligations.  Both shows have their charming merits, but I Dream of Jeannie is full of fun.",1192838400,9,1048,4.610810810810811

 Just love how she obeys me
 Does things that just amaze me so
 She smiles, presto, the rain goes
 She blinks, out pops a rainbow
 Cars stop, even the train goes slow
 When she goes by
 She paints sunshine on every rafter
 Sprinkles the air with laughter
 We're close as a quarter after three
 There's no one like Jeannie
 I'd introduce her to you
 But it's no use, sir
 Cause my Jeannie's in love with me
  She's in love with me!""

2694050,5,B000KLQUSK,"This show is very good and I would suggest it to anyone who watched the shows and loved it when they were on either back in the 1960s or on TV Land). Now this season is not as good as the first one but it is still enjoyable. Several of the episodes in this season revolve around Music from the 60s. In one of these episodes, Jeannie forms a beatles-esque band from a bunch of nobodies on the street to be a replacement band for a show that Dr. Bellows Wife, Amanda is hosting. The other music episode is quite lost on me as what they are trying to do with the plot but rather seems to be a 30 minute music video with some acting in it. For better or worse, half of the one disk for the season (4/8 episodes) is one long episode where Major Nelson manages to get Jeannie locked in a safe and cannot figure how to get her out because the safe is trapped with an explosive  and headed to the moon. This season is the first season where you see Jeannie's sister who is also named Jeannie. You would think that they could come up with another name for her but this does not ruin the plot of any of the episodes which she is in. Jeannie's sister is much more evil than Jeannie and plays on the innocence of Jeannie to take advantacge of her.

My favorite episodes of this season are ""Who are you calling a Genie?"", where Jeannie looses her memory of being a Genie, ""My turned on Master"", where Jeannie transfers her powers to Major Nelson for a day, and ""Jeannie ,the Hip Hippie"", the beatles-esque band episode.

Anyway, this season follows the formula of the previous sesons and experiments with small changes to the recipie that made the first two seasons. In some episodes, they succed and in others they fall short of their goal. All in all this is a good season of I Dream of Jeannie and I would suggest it as a gift for your realitaves who were alive in the 1960s since a few of the references to culture are lost upon me when I watch this with a modern perspectaive. I would also suggest this for anyone else who was not alive, for the pure comedy, since you do not need to understand much of the 1960s culture to enjoy the humor in this season.",1178928000,3,2147,4.206310679611651

Not only was the comic timing of Larry Hagman sheer genius at times, but Barbara Eden's portrayal of Jeannie never wavered.  She decided the character's nuances on day 1, and that's pretty much how it remained throughout the show.

What makes me laugh, more than anything else, are the expressive faces of Hagman and Rorke, coupled with the way the show's special effects were edited.

Sam the Chimp (just after Jeannie pops into the room): ""How's tricks?""

Jeannie (without even taking a breath):  ""I will  SHOW you!""

Too funny.

Enjoy, everyone.

RE:  Pic and sound:  Sony did a great job mastering the set.  However, the opening theme ""skips"" a note, just as it did on Season 2, leading me to believe they've used the same opening.  The music is affected in exactly the same spot!  The colour on the set is brilliant, as the good Dr. pointed out, and sound quality is quite good.
