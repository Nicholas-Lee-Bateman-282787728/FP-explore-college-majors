2711411,5,B000LP5D56,"Legend Films present ""THE LITTLE RASCALS IN COLOR"" (BOX SET) (1930-1938) (252 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- ""Our Gang"", also known as ""The Little Rascals"" or ""Hal Roach's Rascals"", was a long-lived series of American comedy short films about a troupe of poor neighborhood children and the adventures they had together --- Created by comedy producer Hal Roach, Our Gang was produced at the Roach studio starting in 1922 as a silent short subject series --- Roach changed distributors from Path to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1927, went to sound in 1929, and continued production until 1938, when he sold the series to MGM --- MGM continued producing the comedies until 1944. A total of 220 shorts and one feature film, General Spanky, were eventually produced, featuring over forty-one child actors --- In the mid-1950s, the 80 Roach-produced shorts with sound were syndicated for television under the title ""The Little Rascals"", as MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

The series, one of the best-known and most successful in cinema history, is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way --- While child actors are often groomed to imitate adult acting styles, steal scenes, or deliver ""cute"" performances, Hal Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular kids --- Our Gang also notably put boys, girls, whites, and blacks together in a group as equals, something that ""broke new ground,"" according to film historian Leonard Maltin, such a thing had never been done before in cinema, but was commonplace after the success of Our Gang --- Unlike many other motion pictures featuring children that are based in fantasy, producer/creator Hal Roach rooted Our Gang in real life: the majority of the kids were poor, and the gang was often put at odds with snobbish rich kids, officious adults and parents, and other such adversaries --- The series was notable in that the gang included both African Americans and females in leading parts at a time when discrimination against both groups was commonplace.

2711450,5,B000LP5D56,"My husband was recently talking about how much he used to love watching the Little Rascals and our old VHS tapes were long gone. ( Along with our VCR)  Being that he was scheduled for surgery I decided to order this set for him to watch while he was recovering. He loves it!!! It was so much fun to watch him laugh at all of these Little Rascals antics.
As I read in other reviews, the quality is great, especially for the price. I would highly recommend this set for any Little Rascals fans. Neat to have the options of watching in color or b/w. if you are a stickler for the politically correct then the Little Rascals aren't for you.",1344556800,,636,4.256198347107438

2711452,5,B000LP5D56,I own several Little Rascal DVD's and this is the best quality I have seen. The video is really cleaned up and its great seeing them in color. The color looks really natural. I won't pick it apart for the episodes selected. I just hope they make more of these because I will buy them. Highly recommend!,1219276800,,302,4.315789473684211
2711453,5,B000LP5D56,"This 3 dvd box set offers a lot of value for a small price.  I found the colorization about the best Ive ever seen - so detailed you might mistake it for early Technicolor - and if you are an avid opponent of colorization, the black and white original are all there too
Be aware these shorts are often not politically correct especially in the portrayal of African-Americans but they accurately reflect the mores of the 30s...",1213401600,3,426,4.532467532467533
2711454,4,B000LP5D56,"Many Boomers grew up with The Little Rascals on TV. They were, and still are, CLASSIC! Long unavailable on DVD, this current release brings back all the chuckles as well as the fond memories of our youth. The bonus of colorized versions only augments the beauty and value of this collection. For the ""purists"" there is the old B&W which, undeniably, has a beauty and worth all its' own. Extras are included- most having never been seen before- more added value. Liner notes with dates are very important to me. Alas there are none which is why I withheld a star. All in all, however, should another collection be released, I would not hesitate to buy it up. If you are a fan... start with this three disk set now.",1209686400,2,713,4.492307692307692

2711457,3,B000LP5D56,"I REMEMBER LIKING THE LITTLE RASCALS WHEN I WAS LITTLE SO PURCHASED FOR MY CHILDREN TO SEE THEM.  BUT WATCHING THEM NOW AS A CHRISTIAN ADULT, I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, AND WHILE MAYBE PARTS ARE STILL FUNNY, MANY PARTS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE.  MY YOUNG BOYS EVEN POINTED OUT HOW THE LITTLE GIRLS ARE INAPPROPRIATELY DRESSED FOR LITTLE GIRLS & THAT THE LITTLE CHILDREN KISS, AND SAY IF THEY KISS EACH OTHER, THEY SHOULD BE MARRIED! I UNDERSTAND THESE WERE MADE DURING THE TIMES WHEN ""FOLLIES"" AND DANCE MUSICALS WERE POPULAR, BUT I HAVE TO AGREE, THE LITTLE GIRLS ARE NOT DRESSED MODESTLY AT ALL.  FURTHER, MANY OF THE THEMES ARE ADULT IN NATURE, SOME THE LITTLE ONES DON'T UNDERSTAND. BUT SOME LIKE DISOBEYING THEIR PARENTS, PLAYING HOOKY, TALKING DISRESPECTIVELY TO THEIR PARENTS, PLAYING TRICKS ON ADULTS, OUTWITTING THE ADULTS, AND SAYING SHUT UP AND IDIOT TO EACH OTHER IS NOT KIND AND NOT A GOOD ROLE MODEL FOR LITTLE KIDS TO FOLLOW. ALTHOUGH WHEN I WAS LITTLE I WOULD PROBABLY RATE THESE A FIVE STAR, NOW SEEN FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, I RATE THEM A 3 FOR FAMILY FRIENDLY!",1186185600,4,1113,4.72680412371134
2711458,5,B000LP5D56,I grew up watching The Little Rascals and I wasn't sure what to think when I saw they were colorized. I was very impressed with the quality once I sat down and watched a few episodes. They did a great job colorizing and cleaning up the film defects in the movies. It brings new life to these classics. Worth every cent.,1185840000,8,319,4.245901639344262
2711459,5,B000LP5D56,"Well, to quoat one of ""The Little Rasccals"" it was ""REMARKABLE"". As a kid of the 1970's, I used to watch them all the time. But what was really ""REMARKABLE"" was how clear & sharp the picture & sound was, & then to also watch it in color was like breathing new life into an old painting!
