2307053,5,B0009OM6CW,"We have other Bible song CDs, but this is the one my kids request all of the time!  The songs are good quality with enough variety so that the kids delight in each one.  I love that I can actually enjoy them as well without growing annoyed.  In fact, I find that I am memorizing scripture right along with them!  My kids are preschool age & love to watch the DVD as well.  (The clothing is 80's, but the kids don't mind.) They do the actions with the song, ""And Jesus Grew"" and the signs with ""This is How We Know.""  The song, ""When I Am Afraid"" has brought comfort at bedtime.  Even my 3-year-old now knows the words to the Lord's Prayer just by singing, ""Our Father In Heaven.""  There are 20 songs on the CD and 13 on the DVD.  Before the songs there is a brief introduction & a verse is given.  After the first time, the kids got used to the ""talk"" in between songs and it quickly became their favorite CD. My children have learned so much scripture just listening to this collection!  They truly enjoy it and it has been great for all of us.  How could I ask for anything more?",1232409600,6,1081,4.144230769230769
2307054,5,B0009OM6CW,The kids love these DVD's and request them in the car and at home. Great or learning verses.,1219795200,,92,4.166666666666667
2307055,5,B0009OM6CW,"The music is an excellent way to teach your child (and yourself) Bible texts, and listening to it over and over again hasn't driven the adults in our home crazy...on the contrary, we all enjoy it as much as the kids do.  The DVD is great to watch too, although it is definitely geared to school aged kids, as opposed to the second volume DVD which is great for preschoolers as well as older kids.
When it comes to Steve Green's music for kids, you can't go wrong.  Everyone in the family will enjoy it.",1193011200,13,502,4.273684210526316
8064300,3,B0009OM6CW,I Love the music!!!! but it skips in several places  the very  first time we listened to it. very annoying,1394841600,,106,4.25
8064301,3,B0009OM6CW,I have the VHS.  I bought the DVD in order to be able to jump to different tracks.  This feature is not present on the DVD.,1376092800,,123,3.6923076923076925
8064302,5,B0009OM6CW,"I just ordered this for my daughter after a few weeks of listening (and watching at times) to Volume 2 at least 10 times a day.  In that time, my little girl, who just turned two, has learned the words to every song and verse and sings along.  I had these CD's (okay, cassettes) when I was growing up, and I still remember every word to every song.  Watching and listening to my daughter praise the Lord and learn the Bible through Hide Em In Your Heart, the way I did, is one of the most joyful, encouraging things I have ever seen.

With the instant download, we are already listening to these new songs (I need a little more variety!).  So excited to share what was my favorite music growing up with my kids!  My seven month old son loves the music, too!",1375920000,,757,4.222222222222222
8064303,5,B0009OM6CW,This is a great cd full of uplifting music. The words of the songs are wonderful and include scripture and great lyrics for kids to learn and memorize. My mom even likes to listen to this cd often. It's great to teach kids of all ages how important it is to keep scripture and praise in the forefront of their minds.,1313712000,,316,4.19672131147541
8064304,5,B0009OM6CW,"There are very few cds and dvds out there that teach bible verses, in a meaningful and not odd way. This is definitely at the top.",1307577600,,130,4.038461538461538
8064305,5,B0009OM6CW,"Love the C.D./DVD, but I cannot get the performance tracks for our 3 & 4 year old choir and the sheet music is not available either...

The music is really great, but it needs to be supported for children's choirs.",1303948800,2,214,4.35
8064306,4,B0009OM6CW,"This cd/dvd is straight from the bible. scripture verse made into songs just as the description says.  the dvd is pretty outdated...stone washed jeans, crazy hair cuts ect.  but, as fars as the content it is EXCELLENT.",1294704000,,218,4.864864864864865
8064307,5,B0009OM6CW,My children enjoyed these songs growing up. Now their children will have the same opportunity.  What a great way to learn the Bible - through these timeless children's songs.,1265932800,,174,5.0

8064309,5,B0009OM6CW,This is an excellent DVD/CD.  The songs are illustrated very effectively through the real-life stories.  Children need to see God's Word in action and this DVD helps them to see that very clearly.  Your children will love this DVD.,1243641600,,231,4.871794871794871
