2797952,1,B000OOOKZS,"I sat down to watch this video with an open mind. What I got was 10 minutes of science and then propaganda and more propaganda based on faulty science and psuedo-Christian attacks. Unless you want to disbelieve actual non-biased science, then this video should be avoided. I can not comment on ""An Inconvenient Truth"" because I have not seen it. But from all the evidence that I have seen first hand, read from reputable, scholarly journals (not left or right wing hype), we are suffering a crisis. This DVD is nothing but someone's attempt to disregard evidence and the truth and to obfuscate peoples' minds.",1192579200,19,609,4.809523809523809
2797953,5,B000OOOKZS,"This is a very important and well presented documentary. It is most important to offer an alternative argument to the current received wisdom from increasingly hysterical media and control freakish politicians. The newly created religion of 'carbon emmissonism' must be exposed for what it is. This new religion does not differ substantially from other religions including Christianity in its dubious origins (dodgy dossiers, ambiguous facts and murky political motives) but its purpose is exactly the same, control through fear.

While I am not too sure that I believe it word for word, it offers quite a bundle of facts, figures and curves, I didn't find these any dodgier than those presented either in the original IPCC document, the Al Gore film or some of the other media offerings on this very complex subject. Suffice to say that it opens up the whole subject offering a credible alternative argument and some interesting causes and effects.

No-one would dispute that we should look after the planet we inhabit and try to minimise pollution, waste and despoliation plus we certainly should nurture our precious wild spaces, flora and species, however, this has nothing whatsoever to do with global warming. Global warming is a natural phenomenon, quite simply, why would the sun give off exactly the same amount of heat all the time without any fluctuation, it is just not credible that it would. These fluctuations have caused global warming (and cooling) many times in the past long before Western Capitalism was invented.

Furthermore, I recall the fifties when walking to school through the London smogs was like a walk on a mystery planet, you couldn't see the houses at the end of their front yards from the pavement, this was a very frequent occurrence, however, the clean air act of 1955 (from memory) put an abrupt end to that. To 'believers' the reduction of carbon emissions in the atmosphere in the fifties solved air pollution and smogs but didn't stop global warming - however, it will now, bizarre! But when you are a believer no power on Earth will convince you, try to convince a devout Christian that Jesus didn't walk on water or bring Lazarus back from the dead! Furthermore the non believers must be reviled and ridiculed, in the old days these were the heretics or infidels, nowadays you are a global warming denier.

In my work as an engineer working the offshore oil industry, I have day to day involvement with weather prediction and oceanography and it is well known that weather cannot be reliably predicted more than 3 days ahead but the 'Green' high priests and Marxist controlistas (who automatically have to blame Western style capitalism for just about everything) want to extrapolate weather predictions 50 years ahead in a straight line from some pre selected time and make draconian predictions to terrify everybody, thereby gaining control of minds and wallets.

This documentary makes many very interesting propositions the most interesting being the prejudicial treatment of the third world, they cannot get funding for cheap (ie hydro carbon powered) power generation they must develop in an acceptable 'Green' way (presumably expensive wind farms and geothermal etc), thereby ensuring they remain in undeveloped poverty.

All in all this film provides a very well argued alternative explanation for global warming and one which should be made available to all and given fair consideration for open debate and honest appraisal by scientists and laymen alike.",1192406400,8,3506,5.109947643979058
2797954,5,B000OOOKZS,"This documentary is essential if you want to get to some light in the global warming ""debate"" led (meaning guided but not Light-Emitting-Debate) by the new Nobel prize winner Al Gore. Al Gore's film is not a documentary because it does not take into account any alternative hypothesis or model that could in any way jeopardize his own approach. This here film is a documentary because it does take into account several approaches and it is always referring to the CO2 hypothesis and the IPCC process. This documentary brings forward a whole set of scientific research that question the CO2 hypothesis and bring forward other hypotheses. It is thus essential if we want to know more than what we are allowed to absorb from the standard point of view that has become politically correct. Then it is also essential because it acknowledges the fact that all climatologists work on models and that models are not reality but only a tool for us to analyze and interpret reality, but a tool that tends to project onto reality the a priori vision that the model contains. The third important contribution of this documentary is the historical dimension it takes and develops. It connects several historical events and political motivations and shows how these had to bring forward the present CO2 approach. Margaret Thatcher's distrust of the Mine Workers' Union, hence coal, and of the Middle East, hence oil, made her invest in nuclear power. The miracle of North Sea oil exploited by the English intensively and wastefully. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the recycling of left-wing militants from communism to anti-capitalistic ecology or whatever. It also insists on the fact that the West's desire to limit development is particularly egocentric and selfish because it means to maintain the undeveloped areas of the planet in un-development: the documentary gives examples of the deadly consequences of the lack of electricity in Africa. It also rebukes the pretension that malaria is a southern, hence tropical disease, what's more only at low altitudes. Yet it is not complete. One thing is missing at least. It is BP who is selling solar panels in ex-English colonies and Total is said to detain the similar license in France. This means the present campaign against CO2 corresponds to the change in strategy of these enormous corporations that have worked essentially in oil and now are preparing the after-oil future. At the same time the documentary is slightly short. There is no reason whatsoever to pollute when we can be clean, and that for two main reasons, first if pollution can be avoided it is ethical to avoid it, and it is also economical to do so because we can thus save on the cost of post-pollution cleaning up. But yet this documentary is essential for us to start seeing some light in the total darkness of the anti-CO2 faith-requiring religious campaign.

And our carbon dioxide emissions do not impact climate change to any meaningful extent.

The ONLY piece of real scientific evidence in ""Inconvenient Truth"" was misinterpreted and misused by Al Gore (the rest is political diatribe, scare stories and religious sermonizing), and actually proves the opposite of what he claims!  The best part of this film, though, is the way it talks about the gross immorality of adopting the alarmists' recommendations and unnecessarily condemning the Third World to more poverty, disease and death.

I know this DVD has only recently been released, so I will warn everyone now that some of the following reviews will be highly negative, posted by Al Gore's True Believers determined not to allow any other viewpoint to be expressed.  Whatever they say should not necessarily be believed.  View this film, verify the sources, and you can make up your own mind.

The best line was from a scientist, who when commenting on how global warming alarmists disregard two of the most important factors in global temperatures - THE SUN and water vapor from oceans, said, ""It's like your car breaks down and to try and determine the problem you disregard the engine, which is the sun, or the transmission, which is water vapor, and you focus on a single lug nut on one of your rear tires.

When, I saw the Co-Founder of Greenpeace, a man of legend if you think about it, saying his peace about global warming, the film becomes a credible piece of work. A man who was part of the green movement speaks out on the subject and it makes sense.

The level of study provided is thorough and balanced.

The side for global warming is correct that air pollution is a problem. It's the reason for dirty air. Dirty air hurts our lungs. We all know this. And it is horrible that we mostly ignore this fact.

Martin Durkin does a great job of showing the trends of weather, with experts in the field. You learn that it is a natural phase of ice caps to melt and grow back over decades of time. He uses NASA satellite data of the changes to show this. This is arguable to many.

His explanation is sound and fairly easy to see and understand, even if you were the other way. Good footage. Good information. Cohesive ideas.

With scientific explanations that the layman can understand,  experts in climatology show very clearly why global warming hysteria is based upon little or no science and is mainly a belief or a religion.  This religion impacts us all, but as the movie shows, its greatest and saddest impact is upon the world's dire poor in Africa and elsewhere around the globe.

My wife and I are very glad to have our own copy of The Great Global Warming Swindle.  Not only is the science well explained, but so also are the origins of the movement that  blames CO2 and man for global warming.  The global warming movement is less about science than it is about major social and economic change that would take us back at least to the mid-ninteenth century if not to the middle ages.  The movement is actually opposed to the prosperity of developed countries, so they are very anti-business and anti-industry (and sometimes violently so, as we have seen in the news).  But, and this is the kicker, the thing that makes the movie very sad in places, the global warming movement is also very much against the world's poor improving their lot.  The global warming movement is one of the world's oppressors of the poor, insisting that they do without any electricity or any modern conveniences, so that they might remain so-called ""happy peasants"".  The environmentalists do not have a realistic view of the plight of the poor.

The viewer can if he wishes delve into the science much deeper by visitng the extras section of the DVD where among other things will be found a very detailed but understandable university lecture given at the University of Carlton in Ottawa, Canada.  Using scientific data collected from sediment cores, we are shown how over history the sun and not CO2 controls climate change and we see how cosmic rays also play an important function.  In particular focus is the sun's eleven year sunspot cycle.  The sunspot cycle correlates far better with the world's temperature changes than does CO2.  In fact there really is no correlation between temperature and CO2.

My wife and I would urge everyone who cares about our modern way of life and the world's poor to get this eye-opening presentation.  It is well worth the money.

Having also seen the DVD Global Warming or Global Governance and Mine Your Own Business, I would say that these along with The Great Global Warming Swindle would give the viewer a good overall view of how global environmentalism works and why it is merely a belief system, or religion, though a very dangerous and oppressive one.",1330041600,10,2757,5.1002227171492205

There is still a debate. There needs to be another documentary JUST like this one. Again!
Not all of the IPCC's scientists were climatologists. Some were activists, economists and people who barely even had a B.S. in climatology when they produced reports on climate change (Mann). Senator Inhofe's website he has over 700 scientists that are finally NOT afraid to speak out against these theories that the IPCC/Al Gore produced. This theory is pretty tempting and it may sound legitimate but people became skeptical of the IPCC when it started it's new section of ""Summary for Policymakers"" in it's reports. Also, nevermind the fact that climatologists around the world starting becoming skeptical of these ""computer model date"" based theories...proxy data to prove your hypothesis? Really? Sounds fishy to scientists. Especially when scientists produce a large report trying to get politicians to tax more people via their carbon usage? Sounds fishy to the American people. Look up gallop polls...you will find that less and less people believe in these thoeries. Not just because of their opinions but because of a documentary like this....opening the doors for debate between scientists and students alike.
Listen, reducing overall pollution is an EXCELLENT goal. Clean air, more fuel efficient vehicles and power, stopping deforestation of rain forests/forests, reducing the possibility of acid rain, etc etc are all GREAT goals to achieve for this world. But simply stating that the ""debate is over or the consensus is clear"" is just plain wrong.
Al Gore forgot the relationship between CO2 and temperature. The Ocean acts as a ""reserve"" for carbon dioxide when the earth cools and releases it when the SUN warms the earth.

I watched this in conjunction with watching the DVD that Gore put out and the difference in the two is shocking as far as which one presents verifiable scientific evidence, and it is not Al's DVD that the judge in the U.K. ruled must be shown only after a disclaimer pointing out 9 obvious errors.

2797993,3,B000OOOKZS,"I just wrote this because someone needed to write a three star review.

Seriously, I was suprised at the high production values in this documentary compared to many I've seen.  High quality sound, photography, and editing, and a soundtrack.  Can't take those for granted these days.

And, a lot of professionals in the climate area expressing their ""heretic"" points of view concerning global warming.  If you don't just decided that global warming skeptics ""aren't scientists"" or they're just ""funded by big oil"" then you'll have at least something to ponder.  My favorite was the co-founder of Greenpeace who described how different the organization is now compared to what he founded.  That alone is almost worth the price of admission to see this movie.

My problem with this documentary is that It seemed just a little unfocused.  The documentary movie is about an hour long, and then there are many special features that almost comprise a second documentary in and of themselves.  I wish it had all been edited together, but I suppose it was originally created to fit a TV broadcast time slot.

A segment that I thought particularly weak (and sad) was when the African mother and her little one were shown building a fire in their hut and watching the smoke fill the hut, along with a description of all the death this practice causes.  Supposedly it's the ""solar and windmills only for Africa"" people to blame for this, but really all the hut (and millions more I assume) needed was a chimney.  You know, cut a hole in the roof and build a column of bricks (the same material the hut was made with, whatever that was) with an opening in the bottom?  Then cook under the chimney.  Western civilization discovered that little trick centuries ago, so what is the deal in some other parts of the world?

Anyway, if you're interested in climate change issues, this is certainly worth a watch.  Then of course there's the controversy following the release of this documentary, which could almost be worthy of a documentary in and of itself.",1270425600,8,2040,4.799426934097421
2797994,4,B000OOOKZS,"I watched this for the first time on the Sundance Channel, actually, and found it fascinating.  I've heard over and over that ""the science is settled"" regarding Global Warming/Climate Change.  And now the U.S., along with the rest of the world, is making widespread policy assuming that human development has caused the earth to heat up -- and that this ""warming"" threatens all life on the planet.

 The qualified scientists in this presentation testify to their own (and others') differing views from that widely touted view (above).  Plus they herein present their own evidences which point to different conclusions than, say, Al Gore might come up with.

The final segment of the film is a more elaborate classroom-type explanation, using sedimentation records from fjords on Vancouver Island.

This all made more sense to me than the hysteria being created by those currently running things in American government, the media and eco-activist groups.  I recommend ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" to open more eyes to the debate that does exist over the global climate issue.",1261872000,2,1080,5.166666666666667
2797995,5,B000OOOKZS,"What an amazing documentary, fast-paced, professionally shot and edited, filled with startling details about a conspiracy finely tuned and carefully guarded.

It is an international disgrace that the blatant lie of global warming has been permitted to gain such traction, reaching all the way into the highest seats of power on earth, now leading to a point where freedoms will once again be chipped away in the name of emergency measures. The last three U.S. presidents, two Democrats and one Republican, all subscribed to the nonsense.

They are either all deceitful proponents of stealing from the people in the form of carbon taxes, blind to the factually based opposing arguments or intellectually too lazy to find out for themselves what is going on. For the refutations make a whole lot more sense than the absurd theory of global warming. Oh yes, let us not forget how proponents recently altered the nomenclature to ""climate change."" The reason, still little known, is due to the inconvenient fact that global temperature kept hitting record lows in recent years.

If nothing else, the most obvious lies should stand out to people victimized by the clever little atheist liberals running the world's largest news organizations. Such as, when Al Gore proclaims that the time for debate is over, one might ponder the lack of ever having noticed any debate to begin with. In other words, these con artists pulled the whole thing off by creating a complete lie, getting their allies in the media to play along, then fending off arguments by stating the arguments had already been waged and decided.

Adding in how the news networks have been pretending this brilliant documentary doesn't exist (kind of like how they pretend opposing arguments by degreed scientists don't exist) lends further doubt to the supposed credibility of the global warming gang.

Then take into account how the entire scam got exposed a couple weeks ago by way of emails leaked to the public. In them, the top people pretending that global warming is a crises were found to be confessing their scheme to each other, describing ways of keeping the world from finding out how they faked the numbers. To the surprise of nobody who bothers to dig for the truth in this age of deceit, the press has ignored what immediately came to be known as Climategate too.

I recommend watching this documentary, getting onboard with the growing millions trying to expose these hucksters. Tell your friends. Vote the atheist liberals out of power worldwide. Take freedom back from these God-hating liars before any further destruction is rained upon your culture than what has already been accomplished through their open immigration, world-welfare and pagan legislation.

Teach your children the truth. Arm them to combat the liberal teachers in public schools and the liberals who run the news and entertainment industry. Go even one step further by exposing the lie of evolution that is, unsurprisingly, forwarded by the exact same people. An excellent evolution video is called 100 Reasons Why Evolution is Stupid by Kent Hovind. You can view the entire thing at youtube. Otherwise, stand back and watch the minds of your own offspring be trained to believe the opposite of truth.

There is quite simply almost no way to understand what is going on today unless you tune into conservative talk radio in America, the Fox News Channel or read from some of the private websites or books produced by the last of the non-brainwashed people remaining on the planet.",1261612800,,3527,5.006825938566553

2798032,5,B000OOOKZS,"This film is a very important and significant work. One of the most important issues facing mankind is the question about man made global warming from CO2 emissions. Many governments are about to enact carbon cap and trade limits on CO2 which will act as another layer of taxation on our economies. While energy independence, the development of alternative and renewable energy, and finding cleaner energies are all vital to mankind, if CO2 is not the cause of climate change, controlling CO2 will do nothing to impact the climate and will only damage our fragile economies (as well as give total economic control to the government in the name of saving the earth).

The authors of the film have put together a compelling documentary about the real driver of the climate, the sun. Anyone who has interest in the subject of climate change and CO2 must see this film. It is probably the best single source of information on it, and certainly the most informative hour and fifteen minutes on the very complex issue.

Global warming alarmists say ""the debate is over"". This reminds me of what Patriot John Paul Jones said in the American Revolution in response to the British, (the modern day Global warming alarmists who want to tax us), who demanded his surrender. His reply, ""I have yet to begin to fight!"". Those who oppose the global warming alarmists must fight a similar battle against an overwhelming power but with the thought that they too, as did the Patriots, had ""right"" on their side.

After the collapse of communism in the 80s, socialist and communist activists found in the environmental movement a way to attack capitalist economies. Why do you think all of the ""solutions"" for global warming involve rich countries having to bear all of the financial burden, and give money to poor countries so they don't have to build up their own economies with coal powered electricity?

Since this seemed to be the very foundation of Al Gore's arguments - or so I was told - it seemed a good idea to do so. My impression from studying the graphs was that Al Gore had gotten the numbers backwards.

This video doesn't just show that he got the numbers backwards, it clearly demonstrates with a lot of data instead of an outburst of emotion, what is really happening. Wether it's a good thing that it's natural as opposed to man-made is debatable. Now we simply can't stop what's happening instead. However, we can stop what is happening to the poorer country that are being pushed very hard and unfairly and are very negativly affected by the global warming movement.

You may think you know all about global warming because you saw or read ""An Inconvenient Truth""; however if you really want to know what in the world is going on, you must see this DVD.  The scientists who were interviewed (some at great peril to themselves) for this documentary have impeccable credentials.  Their sole purpose is to put the science before the public.  Don't make up your mind about the cause and effect of global warming before you see this DVD.

Why have we been so quick to accept blame for Planet Earth's warming?  Are we being given all the facts, and do they support the claim that it's our fault?  What about all those scientist who say it is?  Wouldn't they refute the claims if the science wasn't there?

Well, it depends.  Every university board understands the need for political correctness when it comes to funding. For example, money for research can be hard to find and may not be awarded to an individual or department that doesn't go along with the ""conventional wisdom"" or ""popular conclusions"" of the day.

It simply, succinctly, and honestly states the proven and verifiable scientific facts on the subject.",1225324800,12,1725,4.756756756756757
2798037,1,B000OOOKZS,"The bottom line is this. Without the greenhouse effect there would be no life on this planet but they omit that adding CO2, such as burning fossil fuels, must increase the temperature. CO2 + current greenhouse gases = more greenhouse gases = things get warmer (in this balanced model). There is no way to somersault away from this without creating a means by which this heat goes elsewhere (and it may but this documentary doesn't talk about it).

You might also ask why is it that this documentary is being edited yet again and advertised as a different product to ASIN: B000WLUXZE ? The answer is simple. The makers don't want you to know about its dubious history and subsequent re-editing (it has been through several versions). So viewers owe it to themselves to learn about that (even though the makers of the documentary don't want you to know about it). Scientists who are duped in this are asking/suing to be removed from it. Hence why several versions exist.

First of all, this is not peer-reviewed and there is no peer-review to support any of it and it feeds a certain type of individual that will gladly accept electricity, medical research, acknowledge gravity, dentistry, chemistry, physics and yet when it comes to any science that doesn't suite them or live up to what they want, they reject it even if it uses the same scientific standards. In short, science doesn't tell people what they want to hear, it tells them how things actually are. This documentary wants to tell some people what they want to hear. Do you really think scientists can't find jobs with oil companies and want to work for environmental groups that depend on government funding or donations?

This is currently the argument against anthropogenic global warming. Anti-evolutionists and creationists will tend to also flock here. For some reason, Like Darwinism, anthropogenic global warming seems to be a magnet for anti-science groups. This documentary is an outright attack on good science. The material however is designed to be controversial. At the same time it appears to be the only case made against anthropogenic global warming and it's a very poor one.

Scientists interested in refining their understanding of global warming may want to watch it. Those who are interested in anthropogenic global warming should consult peer-review anthropogenic global warming material (e.g., not Al Gore documentaries, but post-graduate peer-reviewed material). If you don't know how to tell the difference between university and documentaries for entertainment then you really shouldn't be putting your faith in a program like `The Great Global Warming Swindle' (TGGWS). Once you understand the greenhouse effect, then maybe you can watch this, but make sure you understand the issue first. Unfortunately many people are just watching this documentary and deeming themselves experts on global warming and capable of a scientific critic. If you think that, you have been fooled.

TGGWS takes a handful of scientists who seem to make counter anthropogenic global warming claims and mixes it with private commentaries and interpretations about anthropogenic global warming, most of which do not cite their sources. I say `seem to make' because some of the scientists here, Carl Wunsch and Eigil Friis-Christensenhave in particular, complained that the documentary makers quoted them and their work out of context. That is not to say that the documentary doesn't contain scientists who genuinely feel that anthropogenic global warming is rubbish, they are here, but their position has been refuted by the peer-review process whether they like it or not.

TGGWS starts with the premise that scientists have verified beyond a doubt that anthropogenic global warming is happening. This distorts the position considerably. There is evidence to suggest a correlation between the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO2 and a rapid rise in global temperature. These sudden correlating rises are of a significant magnitude to make them unique, even when measured against the past, such as previous glacial and interglacial ice age periods. Ignoring this data would be the wrong thing to do. Acting on it and seeing if we can change things would verify this data. That is the case being made by climatologists.

Anthropogenic global warming critics say that the correlation should be ignored because it has all happened before. They are saying, don't act on this information. That is essentially their argument... and it is bad science.

The documentary is constructed by omitting data from 2000 onwards, duplicity, taking scientists out of context, reediting subsequent editions of the same program, forged graphs, prejudice and not offering up sources. In short a program doesn't get more deceptive than this bogus sham. It really is everything that television watchdogs have been warning us about.

The thing is that it is made to be convincing and it does manage to pull that off. If you haven't got a good background in science and if you don't take the time out to think carefully about it, this exploitation material does have the potential to harm. It is not that the documentary doesn't have a right to the freedom of speech. It does. However, to purposefully set out to dupe people over such an important issue is another thing entirely. This isn't just a case of a documentary about scientists who disagree over anthropogenic global warming. The makers of this film are engaged in much more than just that. What they did is what sent the phones buzzing at the watchdog offices.

If the fact that this program has been edited several times to remove sequences that where exposed as hoaxes or the fact that scientists who appear in this program have since distanced themselves from it because they believe they where misrepresented, isn't enough, there is still more.

Instead of replacing charts with the right ones from the sources they claimed they got the charts from, like NASA, in subsequent editions they removed the name of the source and kept the graph without citation. Isn't that just terrible? To actually keep the forged graph and to omit the source (which offered the correct graph to be used mind you) is just indefensible. Thus graphs appear all over the place without sources. Some of the graphs they use don't match up.

The big wedge they use is that the temperature has dropped during an industrialization period. What they omit is that the temperatures can drop when more aerosols are present in the atmosphere. These prevent solar radiation from getting in, becoming trapped in the greenhouse effect. These aerosol increases are responsible for the slight drops we find in the graphs. Then the greenhouse effect builds up again when more CO2 is added. Climatologists predict this. TGGWS still omits this fact even in updated versions of this program.

Basic global warming models show that other factors can increase/decrease global warming other than CO2. These must be factored into the model but are omitted here. These linkages are called coupling. It is a basic fundamental understanding in science and is especially important with global warming.

They have misused data on the Medieval Warm Period to suggest that it was warmer then than it is today. The fact is that from actual data, not conjecture, it was not as warm as it has been in the past few decades.

The Volcano CO2 conjecture they use has no sources. Not a shred of peer-review for it.

The weather balloon segment conflicts with all the available data on the temperature of the atmosphere. They give no explanation for what is happening in their model of the atmosphere. The solar model they conjecture does not explain it and this same solar model they talk about is factored into global warming models.

TGGWS claims that rises in carbon dioxide follow increases in temperature and so implies that CO2 cannot be causing global warming. This view clashes with the greenhouse effect. There are other factors, such as the Earth's orbit, that can raise the temperature, but this doesn't mean that CO2 doesn't causing warming, as they imply.

Again, without the greenhouse effect there would be no life on this planet but they omit that adding CO2, such as burning fossil fuels, must increase the temperature. CO2 + current greenhouse gases = more greenhouse gases = things get warmer (in this balanced model). There is no way to somersault away from this without creating a means by which this heat goes elsewhere (and it may but this documentary doesn't talk about it).

Essentially the makers of this program have created a pseudoscience that flies in the face of the greenhouse effect, not just anthropogenic global warming.

Science gives a very balanced view of anthropogenic global warming. Since 2000, there is no reason to doubt that there is a relationship between anthropogenic global warming and an environmental crisis, however there is some debate over how much influence we have on this. Scientists have no problem with skepticism, but this documentary is a wooden nickel. When you see the glaring errors and the way the producers have pushed their evidence you can't help but to put this documentary in the same category as telling people that smoking is good for you.

I would recommend watching this documentary only if you follow it up by reading the rebuttals. You can fine tune your skills in debating global warming if you do. I had great fun doing this. Sadly it seems that for some people this is the only thing they will ever watch on anthropogenic global warming and most of them did it because they just didn't like Al Gore. Al Gore isn't the peer-review for anthropogenic global warming... but he does use it, unlike the makers of this program.

Mr. Durkin certainly takes full advantage of the exaggerations and the fact that the man-made global warming theory is based on incomplete science and on ""what if"" scenarios produced with climate simulation models, that are being considered as unquestionable facts by the mainstream media and many politicians. However, and despite the collaboration of respectable scientists, such as Richard Lindzen, Paul Reiter, and Patrick Michaels, Mr. Durkin chose to edit and alternate these qualified expert opinions with comments by the narrator or by some others not so qualified interviewees making the documentary a smear attack on Al Gore and the IPCC. Even spicy conspiracy theories are proposed regarding Margaret Thatcher political agenda for supporting man-made GW, and another to suppress Africa's development by forcing poor countries to use expensive clean energy sources.

On the positive side, the documentary briefly presents the main alternative hypothesis for the origin of modern global warming, solar variations in combination cosmic rays, a physical phenomenon that seems to influence cloud formation, a key element of the natural greenhouse effect and one of the main uncertainties in the consensus theory. However, it is really a shame Mr. Durkin decided not to go deeper into the details of this alternative hypothesis or any other of the serious weaknesses of the prevailing theory;  but instead, he chose to waste the opportunity for making a serious critic of the science behind man-made GW.

The Great Global Warming Swindle lack of seriousness is clearly reflected by the fact that the DVD content is not the same as the originally aired documentary in the U.K. on March 2007, because due to complaints and criticism, some significant factual errors had to be corrected, and one of the original interviewees requested to be withdrawn (M.I.T.'s Carl Wunsch). Even, Eigil Friis-Christensen, one of the leading researchers on the solar variation-cosmic ray theory, who together with Henrik Svensmark were the first to suggest a link between cosmic rays and global climate change, requested for corrections on the content, as findings from his research were not properly used in the documentary.

This despite evidence of the driest conditions since the beginning of the Holocene in southern Victoria and very large rainfall increases in the southeast of Western Australia - the replication of which there is equally little evidence for.

The film begins with a quite surprising and little-known fact about the origin of global warming theory from a renegade Swedish atmospheric scientist (whose name I could not find on Google) at a time when it was widely thought that we would soon be in a new ice age. However, after that it goes rapidly downhill, even when it looks at how Margaret Thatcher took an interest in global warming theory as a result of her desire to see England independent of both Middle Eastern oil and coal miners, whose strikes are shown quite explicitly in one of the film's few interesting passages.

The diagrams of solar intensity and temperature are clearly quite false because they go only to the period before the recent warming, and many writers have noted that solar intensity and orbital forcing suggest the earth should be experiencing a ""cool-down"", as some interviewee critics of the film noted, rather than the warming generated by carbon dioxide. There is also no mention of sulfate aerosols or ""global dimming"" causing the cold period between 1943 and 1956 or of how global warming is already known to have changed the upper atmosphere quite abruptly. ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" even fails to show how the earth has geologically been mainly much warmer than it is now - at the cost of utterly impoverished soils supporting only animals with extremely small brains.

All in all, no matter what Australia's and Red America's ultra-gentle, ultra-meek and hypersensitive outer-suburban families who cannot accept the hurt from drastically less cheap petrol and housing think, global warming is for real and is likely to get much worse in the future, simply because those who advocate radical action like freeway demolition and large-scale public transit investment are having so few children that more fertile global warming sceptics or deniers will form a very large proportion of future generations.

The Court found that the film was misleading in nine respects and that the Guidance Notes drafted by the Education Secretary's advisors served only to exacerbate the political propaganda in the film.

In order for the film to be shown, the Government must first amend their Guidance Notes to Teachers to make clear that 1.) The Film is a political work and promotes only one side of the argument. 2.) If teachers present the Film without making this plain they may be in breach of section 406 of the Education Act 1996 and guilty of political indoctrination. 3.) Nine inaccuracies have to be specifically drawn to the attention of school children.

The inaccuracies are:

  * The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming.  The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.
  * The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years.  The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.
  * The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming.  The Government's expert had to accept that it was ""not possible"" to attribute one-off events to global warming.
  * The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming.  The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.
  * The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice.  It turned out that Mr Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.
  * The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.
  * The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching.  The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.
  * The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.
  * The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand.  The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.

Not all of the inaccuracies in the film were fully considered by the court as the judge requested a sample on which to consider the case.  Professor Carter's witness statement (link below) lists 20 inaccuracies in the film.

2798049,1,B000OOOKZS,"This is currently the argument against anthropogenic global warming. Anti-evolutionists and creationists will tend to also flock here. For some reason, Like Darwinism, anthropogenic global warming seems to be a magnet for anti-science groups. This documentary is an outright attack on good science. The material however is designed to be controversial. At the same time it appears to be the only case made against anthropogenic global warming and it's a very poor one.

Scientists interested in refining their understanding of global warming may want to watch it. Those who are interested in anthropogenic global warming should consult peer-review anthropogenic global warming material (e.g., not Al Gore documentaries, but post-graduate peer-reviewed material). If you don't know how to tell the difference between university and documentaries for entertainment then you really shouldn't be putting your faith in a program like `The Great Global Warming Swindle' (TGGWS). Once you understand the greenhouse effect, then maybe you can watch this, but make sure you understand the issue first. Unfortunately many people are just watching this documentary and deeming themselves experts on global warming and capable of a scientific critic. If you think that, you have been fooled.

TGGWS takes a handful of scientists who seem to make counter anthropogenic global warming claims and mixes it with private commentaries and interpretations about anthropogenic global warming, most of which do not cite their sources. I say `seem to make' because some of the scientists here, Carl Wunsch and Eigil Friis-Christensenhave in particular, complained that the documentary makers quoted them and their work out of context. That is not to say that the documentary doesn't contain scientists who genuinely feel that anthropogenic global warming is rubbish, they are here, but their position has been refuted by the peer-review process whether they like it or not.

TGGWS starts with the premise that scientists have verified beyond a doubt that anthropogenic global warming is happening. This distorts the position considerably. There is evidence to suggest a correlation between the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO2 and a rapid rise in global temperature. These sudden correlating rises are of a significant magnitude to make them unique, even when measured against the past, such as previous glacial and interglacial ice age periods. Ignoring this data would be the wrong thing to do. Acting on it and seeing if we can change things would verify this data. That is the case being made by climatologists.

Anthropogenic global warming critics say that the correlation should be ignored because it has all happened before. They are saying, don't act on this information. That is essentially their argument... and it is bad science.

The documentary is constructed by omitting data from 2000 onwards, duplicity, taking scientists out of context, reediting subsequent editions of the same program, forged graphs, prejudice and not offering up sources. In short a program doesn't get more deceptive than this bogus sham. It really is everything that television watchdogs have been warning us about.

The thing is that it is made to be convincing and it does manage to pull that off. If you haven't got a good background in science and if you don't take the time out to think carefully about it, this exploitation material does have the potential to harm. It is not that the documentary doesn't have a right to the freedom of speech. It does. However, to purposefully set out to dupe people over such an important issue is another thing entirely. This isn't just a case of a documentary about scientists who disagree over anthropogenic global warming. The makers of this film are engaged in much more than just that. What they did is what sent the phones buzzing at the watchdog offices.

If the fact that this program has been edited several times to remove sequences that where exposed as hoaxes or the fact that scientists who appear in this program have since distanced themselves from it because they believe they where misrepresented, isn't enough, there is still more.

Instead of replacing charts with the right ones from the sources they claimed they got the charts from, like NASA, in subsequent editions they removed the name of the source and kept the graph without citation. Isn't that just terrible? To actually keep the forged graph and to omit the source (which offered the correct graph to be used mind you) is just indefensible. Thus graphs appear all over the place without sources. Some of the graphs they use don't match up.

The big wedge they use is that the temperature has dropped during an industrialization period. What they omit is that the temperatures can drop when more aerosols are present in the atmosphere. These prevent solar radiation from getting in, becoming trapped in the greenhouse effect. These aerosol increases are responsible for the slight drops we find in the graphs. Then the greenhouse effect builds up again when more CO2 is added. Climatologists predict this. TGGWS still omits this fact even in updated versions of this program.

Basic global warming models show that other factors can increase/decrease global warming other than CO2. These must be factored into the model but are omitted here. These linkages are called coupling. It is a basic fundamental understanding in science and is especially important with global warming.

They have misused data on the Medieval Warm Period to suggest that it was warmer then than it is today. The fact is that from actual data, not conjecture, it was not as warm as it has been in the past few decades.

The Volcano CO2 conjecture they use has no sources. Not a shred of peer-review for it.

The weather balloon segment conflicts with all the available data on the temperature of the atmosphere. They give no explanation for what is happening in their model of the atmosphere. The solar model they conjecture does not explain it and this same solar model they talk about is factored into global warming models.

TGGWS claims that rises in carbon dioxide follow increases in temperature and so implies that CO2 cannot be causing global warming. This view clashes with the greenhouse effect. There are other factors, such as the Earth's orbit, that can raise the temperature, but this doesn't mean that CO2 doesn't causing warming, as they imply.

Without the greenhouse effect there would be no life on this planet but they omit that adding CO2, such as burning fossil fuels, must increase the temperature. CO2 + current greenhouse gases = more greenhouse gases = things get warmer (in this balanced model). There is no way to somersault away from this without creating a means by which this heat goes elsewhere (and it may but this documentary doesn't talk about it).

Essentially the makers of this program have created a pseudoscience that flies in the face of the greenhouse effect, not just anthropogenic global warming.

Science gives a very balanced view of anthropogenic global warming. Since 2000, there is no reason to doubt that there is a relationship between anthropogenic global warming and an environmental crisis, however there is some debate over how much influence we have on this. Scientists have no problem with skepticism, but this documentary is a wooden nickel. When you see the glaring errors and the way the producers have pushed their evidence you can't help but to put this documentary in the same category as telling people that smoking is good for you.

I would recommend watching this documentary only if you follow it up by reading the rebuttals. You can fine tune your skills in debating global warming if you do. I had great fun doing this. Sadly it seems that for some people this is the only thing they will ever watch on anthropogenic global warming and most of them did it because they just didn't like Al Gore. Al Gore isn't the peer-review for anthropogenic global warming... but he does use it, unlike the makers of this program.

We are solving the problem with the hole in the Ozone layer by reducing CfCs and after reading various sources it seems we are more than capable of solving the anthropogenic global warming problem if we make certain changes to how we live.",1204675200,35,8291,5.060805860805861
2798050,1,B000OOOKZS,"Yet another attempt to undermine real science.  This garbage is trying to, again, make people doubt that there is a consensus in the scientific community about global warming.  The only ""scientists"" who don't seem to agree are those supported by special interests.  The other scientist highlighted in this film have stated that they were either misquoted or mislead and want no part of this movie.  The petroleum industry and those who make huge revenues want this ambiguity to continue so they continue to make their obscene amounts of money at the expense of humanity.  Don't buy into this attempt to mislead.  In spite of commments to the contrary there is no doubt that global warming is a reality: melting ice caps, more severe global weather, changing weather patterns and droughts, bleaching and dying coral, invasive jellyfish species wiping out fish populations.  The list goes on.  Wake up and smell the warming!!!!!!!!!",1204243200,22,930,5.112582781456954
2798051,5,B000OOOKZS,"And thank God for that! One of the scientists here describes the furor surrounding global warming skepticism as being ""a story of anger and intimidation."" Absolutely, that's the way the left fights its battles and his words will resonate loudly with conservatives. Whenever one questions politically correct isms or sacred causes it automatically results in attacks on your person and character. This documentary was absolutely outstanding though and I heartily recommend it. I got my copy from the Heartland Institute and will be passing it on to my friends.

I bought into global warming for 20 years (no joke) and I'm sorry to admit it. Of course, like the scientists here I believe in global warming as a phenomenon but believe that most of what humans do has no impact upon it. These 70 minutes are chock full of valid and excellent points; one of which is that climate is never stable. That's obvious on its face but global warming proponents rely on the notion that fluctuations evidence abnormality, but the earth's temperature is constantly moving in one direction or another.

The Great Global Warming Swindle lacks the production values of An Inconvenient Truth, but it offers an abundance of logical arguments--all of which are more convincing and powerful than what you'll find in the Al Gore flick. The ideas the scientists proffer here directly clash with conventional thinking, and that's a very good thing. Unlike what you'll hear from the mainstream media we discover that temperature changes produce carbon dioxide fluctuations as opposed to it being the other way around. We also find that solar activity, and not CO2, is the principal predictor of the earth's temperature. Therefore, what humans do is largely irrelevant given the force and size of the sun.

The film succeeds in illuminating the ways in which this topic has become entirely politicized over the course of the last two decades. That the Bush administration ended a long line of American resistance to this dogma is a regrettable. To our misfortune, with a Democrat or John McCain taking office in November the future promises carbon taxes and the purposeful derailing of our economy. My only hope is that more people read the contrarian books out there on the subject and see this film. Maybe we can mitigate some of the damage the government will inflict by, yet again, attempting to ""solve"" a problem that is not a problem at all.",1202083200,49,2420,4.970370370370371

A few of the salient points are that eight of the scientists in the film -John Christy, Paul Reiter, Richard Lindzen, Paul Driessen, Roy Spencer, Patrick Michaels, Fred Singer and Tim Ball - are all linked to American neo-conservative and right wing think tanks of which many have recieved tens of millions of dollars from Exxon. Greepeace (which was interviewed by the films maker but had no material in the finished film) has a detailed list of how Exxon funds these climate sceptics.
Professor Carl Wunch who appears in the film states (in the independent march 11th 2007)that he is ""angry because they completely misrepresented me. My views were distorted in the context in which they placed them.....I am the one who has been swindled.""

This is an excellent documentary that exposes the lies of Al Gore and the UN's Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change. They didn't have 2500 of the world's top scientist supporting their report. Many of those people aren't scientists at all, and among the top scientists, many disagree profoundly. At least one threatened legal action to have his name removed.

You'll even hear about something that hasn't been talked about much at all, the infusion of Eastern Bloc commies into the environmental movement after the fall of the Soviet Union.

So at the very very least, can the man-made global warming crowd admit that the debate is not over, even if they would like it to be and think it should be!?

The Great Global Warming Swindle is an excellent documentary, but not perfect.  I would have liked to see more of an opportunity for the Co2 camp to respond to the arguments made by the film-makers.  I think if you are secure in your argument, then you should have no problem getting the other side in on the debate (by the way this was also a great weakness of the Gore movie and a great weakness of the man-made camp in general). It would also have been nice if the film-makers had canvassed a few more scientists who back the film's thesis for their opinion, so as to increase the legitimacy of the argument (I don't believe this was for lack of scientists but the desire to keep the film focused and the message simple).

Apart from this I was immensely impressed by this documentary.  A clearly set out and well made argument.  The film-makers cover the main aspects of the man-made global warming hypothesis and keep the ideas and argument of their antithesis focused, while also managing to explore the history of the debate and its socio-political origins. Everyone, regardless of their persuasion on the issue, should see this film - if for no other reason than that it will force them to think critically about all the issues and shore up their own arguments.  In the same way, and for the same reason, I would recommend everyone see Al Gore's movie.

The Great Global Warming Swindle in dvd format is not only a very thought-provoking film, but also has an excellent 'extra features' section where the film-makers extend their argument into a few more areas.  This section is well capped off by full length (30-40 mins) scientific lecture for those of you keen on the hard science.

I have noticed that reviewers of this film have been giving it either 1 star out of 5 or 5 starts out of 5 - very little middle ground!  That's probably because it is the kind of film that will offend the man-made global warming crowd, and positively reassure the sun-made global warming crowd.  I would suggest you watch this movie with an open mind if you are of the former, and with a questioning mind if you of the latter.

Overall, this film confirmed for me that global warming is happening, but that it is not a man-made phenomenon, and it should not be something to fret about.  I far preferred it to Al Gore's movie because that film seemed less about global warming and more about Al Gore the eco-messiah!  I found that a bit disappointing.  This film on the other hand is not trying to focus on any one person and is a far less emotive and more rational in its approach.  Serious people will enjoy that about the Great Global Warming Swindle.  On a final note, I originally thought the movie's title was bit over the top, and I still think it may deter people from watching it - however, in hindsight, the film so soundly refutes the claim of man-made global warming and highlights so many of the socio-political-economic agendas behind the theory, that I think the title is actually very appropriate.

There is some real science, varying viewpoints, and a theory presented that is up to you to accept or discard, based solely on the merits of the theory (not force-fed to you as if it is the absolute truth).

In the end I now feel mostly embarrassed that I could have been so easily manipulated by the documentary equivalent of Merideth Wilson's, The Music Man.  Fortunately, I have a sense of humor about my own vulnerabilities.

Much of what I discovered during my research is presented in The Great Global Swindle.  The video is well researched and well presented.  It's arguments are coherant and easy to follow, and easy to verify.  The implications raised are far scarier to me than the doom predicted in An Inconvenient Truth.

My emotions and millions of others have been manipulated by Al Gore's, An Inconvenient Truth.  He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for God's sake.

Don't some people and/or their views get right up your nose?

#FIRSTLY, there are those who bravely fly in the face of popular political, press and public opinion. And for this I applaud the makers of these two DVD releases ['The Great Global Warming Swindle' and 'Global Warming Or Global Governance?'], and the appearances in them of those who swim against the tide of the rotten filth that is being spoon fed to the gullible masses of humanity. Indeed, why don't some people think things through for themselves with clarity and sobriety? For example, have you ever noticed just how one-sided the global warming argument is from almost every form of man made communication? All other views appear to be wrong, irrelevant, ignored or heretical. But remember this, that there is NOT an overwhelming consensus of opinion (as the global warming brainwashers would have us believe), as the documentary 'Global Warming or Global Governance?' clearly shows us. A reason for the 'anti global warming' gag is revealed when that documentary describes to us a hidden global agenda. Again, in this other documentary 'The Great Global Warming Swindle', it is explained to us in general terms just WHO is involved in the creation of the reports that are churned out by the IPCC, and what levels of expertise in a particular field the contributors may or apparently may not be suitably qualified in. And in the other GWGG documentary we discover in specific terms exactly HOW those reports are constructed. Anyone with an honourable conscience should be both appalled and alarmed by the modus operandi of this politically driven, government sponsored and corrupt organization.

#SECONDLY, there are those who sadly are perhaps either unwilling, unable, stiff necked, arrogant or morally dishonest in their opposition to plain and sensible facts regarding the current man made global warming fallacy -and sadly there are plenty of them around. For this reason many will choke on the ""Unequivocal"" [an IPCC/Gore buzzword] evidence that is presented in these two rather excellent documentaries. The extras section of the GWSwindle DVD contains some very good additional material. For example, there is a lecture entitled 'Some Real Science', regarding the natural cycles of the sun/weather etc. Not only does this classroom lecture act as an articulate and expert summary explanation and restatement of evidence submitted in the documentary, but it is also factual evidence which generally, we the public are not being told.

#THIRDLY, - Fact 1. The Norsemen [Vikings] did not migrate to Greenland and enjoy the good weather there as a result of 'man made' global warming. Fact 2. At the present time Australia is suffering its worst drought in over a hundred years, but obviously 'man made' global warming could not possibly have caused the previous one. Fact 3. Apparently, Australia is one of the world's hottest, driest continents. Fact 4. believe it or not but living as I do on the North East coast of England right beside the North sea, we over here are currently experiencing 'global cooling', with not even a hint of warming anywhere - but then, this has been the case for a number of centuries over here at this time of year. Perhaps the IPCC will come and turn up the heat for us?

#LASTLY, for those of you who are wondering why Amazon removed the title 'Global Warming Or Global Governance?' from its store, and would like a copy of it, the address on the World Wide Web can be found when you join all the words of the DVD title together but remove the word 'or' [and don't forget the dot and the com]. Alternatively - have a root around the World Wide Web for americanvision where it is listed in their top ten products. I would also recommend GWSwindle and GWGG as being good and complimentary companions to each other.

It is not unlikely that the contents of this review will irritate a plethora of people. No doubt it will probably get a lot of 'unhelpful' hits, particularly by those whose attitudes I have described in my 'second' point. But really friends, I for one could not care less just how far up other peoples proverbial noses the GWSwindle, GWGG and me may or may not get.

2798068,5,B000OOOKZS,"This DVD shows a lot on inconsistencies that the pro-global warming crowd would rather forget. Not everything in this DVD is 100% true, much like the thirty known lies in the al gore film, but it does a good job in outlining many of the contested and down right deceitful arguments around global warming. Do not accept all of this as fact, you need to do research on top of this, but use it as a place to get started in the battle to inform yourself and those around you.",1195776000,9,471,4.2444444444444445

2798070,5,B000OOOKZS,"I have grown very tired of listening to politicians and activists promote their man-made climate change agendas without proper regard for the underlying science.  Finally, we have an opportunity in the ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" to hear from such professors as Lindzen, Christy, Ball, Michaels, Stott and others.  These scientists are truly faithful to the scientific method and lay out that information so that a layperson can understand the theory of man-made climate change.  When one can examine the real data, one sees just how unsupported this theory is.  It is also very illuminating to see what the IPCC process really was and how many important scientists objected to the published summary and tried to get their names removed from the report.  Martin Durkin has performed a great service to us by presenting these important issues in this very powerful documentary.  If you have watched Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, as I have, you need to watch Swindle as well.",1195603200,27,980,5.09375
2798071,5,B000OOOKZS,"I have shown this film to a couple of Global Warming true believers and it has broken their convictions. The message we get from the media is so one-sided that a shock is helpful in jump-starting one's own thinking. Now, every major newspaper has its own eco-journalist whose living depends on spreading the Global Warming Gospel. It takes effort to learn about the other side of the argument.

Why do I have the feeling that at the root of the Global Warming hysteria also lies some good old judeo-christian guilt for the nice and comfortable standard of living we enjoy in countries with an advanced state of development?

2798072,4,B000OOOKZS,"Really good (but not perfect) documentary and media contribution to the debate on manmade global warming. Ideally, we'd have something more like a public trial where all the evidence from both sides would be openly presented and critiqued from both sides.

I understand that alarmists are afraid of debate because they believe that if the public sees an issue as debatable, then the public will reject the radical changes being prescribed. Unfortunately, radical alarmists have a prevailing tendency to dictate some of the worst and unnecessary tragedies of civilization and government. I'd much rather live in a world where we can continue to freely debate and inform ourselves on these issues, even it at the perceived risk of altering the climate.",1195171200,6,750,5.198347107438017
2798073,5,B000OOOKZS,"Finally, a documentary countering Al Gore's eco-hysteria.  Very well done, supported by strong research.  The documentary is quite entertaining and directed towards the general public.

In this documentary, you will see that:
a) there is no ""scientific consensus"" on the issue of man-made global warming.  In fact, there are many scientists that consider the theory of man-made global warming to be simply untenable when confronted by the data.
b) there have been periods in relatively recent human history, with much warmer climate, such as the Medieval Warm Period.
c) the Earth's climate is not, has never been and will never be, something static.  The Earth's climate is very dynamic, and is always changing.  That's why we have had so many episodes of ice ages, then warming, then ice age again, then warming, and so on.
d) the paleoclimatic evidence so often cited by Al Gore and the eco-alarmists, when analyzed deeper, shows that the ice-core records reveal something very different from what these eco-alarmists pretend.  Those ice-core records show that the changes in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 do not precede, but FOLLOW the warming or cooling of the Earth's atmosphere.  This lagging effect has been calculated to be of approximately 800 years.  Thus, it is not CO2 that is driving climate change, but in any case it is the other way round.
e) you will learn of a very interesting alternative hypothesis that explores the role of the Sun on climate change.

And many other things that you should know.",1195084800,20,1524,5.035856573705179
2798074,5,B000OOOKZS,"This version of ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" is only 1 hour long compared to the original 1 hour 16 minute version, But contains an additional 30 minutes of additional interviews with Scientific specialists in their fields in the ""Extras"" section of the DVD Menu.  In addition to that the Extras also includes a 30 minute lecture on research that has discovered about 5 different cycles of the sun and the climate changes it has caused going back many thousands of years.

This documentary exposes the mass fraud at every level, and Journalistic malpractice behind the Global Media Driven Global Warming Scam, and disproves every single claim made by Global Warming Propagandist with naked merciless hard core scientific facts and data from many of the scientist that are actually making the measurements.  Most of which are current members of the IPCC or former members of the IPCC itself.  They bring forth a great number of Climatologists, Meteorologists, NASA Scientists, Astrophysists and many other Scientific Specialists to explain the data and what the actual cause and effects really are.  The data actually proves that Temperature drives CO2, CO2 has never driven temperature.  Also exposes how Al Gore ignores water vapor as being the most dominate greenhouse gas of all, and the serious importants of greenhouse gases that makes Earth livable.

In Al Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth"" he had ZERO experts and ZERO Scientific specialists to back up his fraudulent claims that Global Warming caused everything from diseases to mass floods, outrageous sea level rise and Hurricanes.  All of which was proven to be a lie by actual scientific experts in these fields.  The only Credentials that Al Gore has in this field of science is that he made a ""D"" in Earth Science while in college.  Al Gore isn't even qualified to clean the toilet bowls at the IPCC much less be setting their policies and making documentaries about Earth Science and Global Warming.  Al Gore should of spent more time doing his homework instead of protesting the Vietnam war when he was in college.

In the extras section of the DVD Patrick Moore, the original co-founder of Greenpeace, argues that if Global Warming is supposed to be this great apocalyptic end of the world that will cause mass extinctions, then the Global Warming pushers need to explain why the number of species is billions of times more diverse in the Earth's warmer climates than it is in the colder Artic and Ant Artic circles.  The number of species in the Artic Circle is pitifully few and mostly none existent compare to the warmer areas of the Earth.  They also need to explain why most species migrate south for the winter and seek out the warmer months in the southern hemisphere during our winter, and those that can't make the journey cower and hide into hibernation to get away from the cold winter months.  No species migrates away from the heat during the summer months.

The Ice Core data actually shows we are living in the coldest 700 years of the current 10,000 year long interglacial period.  We started measuring and recording our weather at the coldest point in the past 10,000 years during the 1800's..",1194652800,10,3177,4.919475655430712
2798075,4,B000OOOKZS,"It seems that the reviews are either 5 stars, or 1 star. Which goes to show you that these reviews may be fueled by ideological zeal rather than an accurate commentary on the information in the film and the way that info was presented. ...So, in an effort to stand alone against the tides of conflicting worldviews, and to prove that I am a freethinking individual who is not on some big oil payroll, I will give this film four stars. -It is logical, it is clearly stated, and it is a top notch production. It is also a must see to all who care about this issue, especially children in public school as a counter-balance to all the climate hysteria being presented to their young and impressionable minds. Whether a Gore disciple or not, every man ought to hear both sides of any issue, and let him make up his own God-given mind.",1194307200,10,830,4.396103896103896
2798076,5,B000OOOKZS,"I've been reading archaeology and history texts for years, and they led me to read more about meteorology and climatology before it came to the attention of the general public. I remember those ""world will freeze over"" scares in the '70s. There used to be witches in Salem, and once upon a time the world was flat, too. ""All those people can't be wrong"" is such a specious argument. There are many scientists speaking out against the anthropogenic global warming movement, but science-based documentaries like this and similar articles and books will not make a dent in the religion of global warming.

One does not need to be an expert in science or politics to evaluate the work of experts. Fortunately, the fuzzy ""logic"" of the anthropogenic global warming movement is easy to see through. Don't let the hysterical and populist media tell you what to think. Watch this documentary, read a few books and evaluate the situation for yourself.",1193443200,20,942,4.8875
2798077,1,B000OOOKZS,"Unfortunately, pivotal points in this documentary rest on flawed or misinterpreted science.  An excellent detailing of these flaws is displayed on www dot climateofdenial dot net.  The site also includes email exchanges between Bob Ward (the primary signatory of the complaint raised) and 'Swindle's' producer, Martin Durkin.  Even the email exchanges are telling--Ward proceeds calmly and systematically throughout them, with Durkin often resorting to inflammatory, misleading, and ad hominem tactics in an attempt to fend off Ward's allegations.  Anyone truly interested in the facts about global warming should look beyond propaganda pieces like 'Swindle' to the real facts.

FYI--I have not seen Gore's film (so I cannot comment on its potential merits or detractions), but as a rule I'm skeptical of any mass-market, condensed presentation of supposedly scientific facts.  You should be too.",1193097600,24,896,5.6992481203007515

2798079,1,B000OOOKZS,"It would be nice if much of what this video tells us is true: Climate change is a fabrication of a left-wing, scientific conspiracy; much of the purported temperature rise we think we see across the planet is a result of faulty measurements or forces we can't control; and the like.

Alas, much of what the video tells us isn't true. Your first clue when watching the movie is that (although it was produced in 2006), no data are reported after ~ 2000.  Hmmm...why would that be for a video that purports to be ""cutting edge?""  Would it have anything to do with the fact that, by 2003, warming had increased to such a point that scientists finally had their ""smoking gun"" with respect to human activity, CO2, and climate change?  No explanation is given for this truncation of data at 2000...we're just asked to accept it.  This is but one example of intentional distortion of the facts -- but you have to tip your hat to these guys for their cleverness.

If you see this as an antidote to potential manipulation by the Gore video and Gore followers, ask yourself: How do you know you're not being manipulated by this video as well?  To get some traction on that question, start by looking at the Wikipedia entry for this video...it'll give you some sense of the larger political context within which this movie sits.

Then go over to the website realclimate(dot)org  Click on the ""start here"" icon and scroll down to the bottom of the page for the links about ""thinking seriously about contrarian views.""  Check out the links, learn a bit more about the innards of the scientific controversies (the basic principles aren't that complicated, and they're often at odds with the claims in this video).  And look for the discussion of this movie on the site.

As for my bias...I'm a political scientist with deep faith in deliberative democracy.  We're at our best when we're debating issues that matter with all the passion that we can muster.  So I invite the arguments among us that this video fuels (and which it fueled big time in the United Kingdom).  But surely we owe it to ourselves, and to the sanctity of democratic debate, to learn as much as we can about the foundational facts of an issue before reaching tentative conclusions.

You may agree.  That is perhaps what brought you to this page.  Check out the video, then...but stay wary and critical.  The ""there's no such thing as climate change"" camp has an agenda too, with some powerful allies in the fossil-fuel industry.",1193097600,40,2485,4.671264367816092
8185843,5,B000OOOKZS,"Easiest and most comprehensive single 2-hour session of material to prove Global Warming (now innocuously mislabeled 'climate change') is a hoax.  This video has a one hour 'movie' mostly of testimony by climate SCIENTISTS on how global warming was created as a political lie to get money from governments.  The other hour is added time with those SCIENTISTS plus a few basic explanations of real climate science you can vet, including a class at the end re solar activity on two ecological ocean areas in Canada, which illustrate the macro rules.

There also is a shorter movie version which takes about 15 minutes of the added 'Extra Features' in this original 2-hour DVD.  The shorter movie unfortunately has the same title, so check the TIME of the DVD sold, as its total time is 75 minutes or so.  It is also on Youtube.

So I bought this longer one to see what material had been cut out of the shorter one.

Upshot, is this: Sun controls cosmic rays whic control clouds which control climate 'today'.  Over MILLIONS OF YEARS we can track the sun CYCLES, and see how climate has varied and its effects.  One of those EFFECTS is C02, NOT a 'cause' as the lying global warming 'climate change' pimpers would have you believe.  In short, they flat lie about observable and tracked SCIENCE going back millions of years (in the data, testable through tree rings, ice cores, and more recently in weather baloons, etc).  Atop that lying, the UN IPCC lies about what 'scientists' agree with it, lies about the temperature record, and lies about greenhouse gases (which is primarily water vapor, and C02 of ALL kinds including all animals, plant life, your breathing, and all human industralization, is only .0054).

In short, it's a swindle.  But worse, it keeps AFRICA and other developing poor nations, in a vise grip, cuz the so called global warming is used to PREVENT them from developing their own natural oil, coal, and other resources to INDUSTRIALIZE.  Thus killing millions who must suffer burning stuff within their own huts for food (and die from the noxious fumes or don't live long, same story as ancient Russia).

Most important, you can UNDERSTAND and VET every claim made in the video, which is backed up by plenty of graphs from the used-to-be-honest government sources.. because the SCIENTISTS testifying in this video, are all prominent, still at or formerly part of, governments which sponsored the measurements.  So you know those same governments either are now lying or go unheard in their opposition to the Al-Gore liars claiming 'climate change' is manmade.
