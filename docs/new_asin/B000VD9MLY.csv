8218139,1,B000VD9MLY,Love standard deviants...however the box said macro...The first couple frames said macro. Then the video was actually micro.  Didn't help me for the macro class obviously.,1419120000,,171,5.576923076923077
8218140,3,B000VD9MLY,"As an IB Economics instructors for 20+ years, I use this video, but with reservations.  The academic material is good, and well explained.  The ""comedy"", however, is absolutely pathetic, and really reduces the video's effectiveness.  Most of it is so sophomoric that it turns the kids off, so they don't really want to watch it.  What a shame.

Additionally, the ""DVD"" is simply the old VHS burned onto a disc.  There are no chapters or scene selection options like you'd expect on a DVD.  So it's difficult to go to the particular section of the video that you want to show.",1384646400,,575,4.633663366336633
8218141,5,B000VD9MLY,It definitely helps you understand the concepts of finance. I got hooked on these back in high school. I still think they're rather relevant. The presentation is a bit on the... strange side. It's the strangeness that makes it stick for you.,1306368000,,241,4.761904761904762
8218142,5,B000VD9MLY,"THIS VIDEO HAS HELPED ME OUT A LOT.  THANK GOD FOR STANDARD DEVIANTS FOR MAKING LEARNING INTERESTING, INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING.  AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO ON MACROECONOMICS SEVERAL TIMES, I AM QUITE SURE I WILL PASS MY MACROECONOMICS CLASS I AM NOW TAKING.  I WILL LET Y'ALL KNOW HOW I DID.",1289779200,,294,4.84
