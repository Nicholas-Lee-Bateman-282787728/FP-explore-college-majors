His Trademark - Usually cast as one of those jocks, studs, or hunks who -- proud of his physique -- finds excuses to take his shirt off, so be warned folks, it does happen quite a few times in this series.

6994020,5,B00SWFMB8O,"I consider myself a collector of vintage TV, with that being said it did indeed meet my expectations, I thoroughly enjoyed those shows, shows of today not so much.",1432598400,4,163,4.655172413793103
6994021,5,B00SWFMB8O,"It is so nice to be able to enjoy oldies like Bronco, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne and others once again via DVD.  These programs aired during an era when TV had shows that the whole family could watch and enjoy together.  No bare T&A, humping every other few minutes or trash talk and no ""F"" word!  Just good clean viewing and with an intelligent story line to boot.  Granted, there are none of the loud ear deafening CG special effects that film makers seem to be unable to do without these days but what the hey.  Sure beats today's offerings that are shoved in our faces every time one turns the TV on e.g., all those idiotic reality shows, keeping up with the money grubbing, headline making, do anything for a buck dysfunctional grubbers and the like.  Give me these type shows any day.  Thank goodness for ME TV.  FYI - season 4 became available for pre-order as of 05 May 2015 at movies unlimited.",1431216000,8,896,4.45398773006135

6994023,5,B00SWFMB8O,This is part of the W B Presents along with Sugarfoot and Cheyenne.  This series was fun to watch because you watched a different hero ride through an adventure  each week and this was good marketing by Warner Bros to attract TV viewers watch their shows.  This show was well written and produced.  Ty Hardin was a good chioce for the lead role.  A good DVD to add to your collection.,1430092800,5,384,4.352112676056338

6994030,5,B00SWFMB8O,"The Third Season of Bronco was Fantastic. Tell Warner Brothers to stop wasting Time and release season 4 of Bronco  ASAP. On another note, I also own copies of Sugarfoot Season 2, 3 ,and 4.  so I wish Amazon would stock Sugarfoot Season 1, so I can purchase a copy to complete my collection.

Thanks again Amazon and I look foreward to buying more old TV shows and movies form you in the near future.
