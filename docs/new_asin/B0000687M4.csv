7963772,1,B0000687M4,"I normally only write about videos that have few comments and are either way over or under rated. This rating totally missed the mark. Foreign ""college students/reporters"" wandering without purpose trying to find/film WAR CRIMES.  The bad guys are over played and lack any degree of believability. The ""students"" with a newish jeep brought lots of gas (stored somewhere) forgot to bring any oil. Oil leak only appeared before the engine burns up after perhaps hundreds of miles.  The plot is then for these students to carry someone, an idiot that stood up to get a better view of the killing, gets shot and this friend killed. He is so near death but they decide to carry him in a stretcher they just happened to have with them,  over hill and dale and woods before he finally looses that last ounce of blood. I will let you evaluate the BIG ending for yourself. Total waste of time and money. Don't even rent it!",1251072000,,914,4.595092024539877
7963773,4,B0000687M4,This is an interesting factional piece that presents an alternative creative story set to the back drop of the complex Bosnian crisis.  Low budget but I loved the energy and dramtaic components of the story - all good independent film stuff!,1213833600,,241,4.878048780487805
