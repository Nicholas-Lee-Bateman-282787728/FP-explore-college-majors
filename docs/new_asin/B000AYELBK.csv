2397495,5,B000AYELBK,my kids LOVE this!  it's so fun and really well shot.  I am now a huge fan of yoga kids and tell everyone to get it!,1206403200,3,116,3.423076923076923
2397496,5,B000AYELBK,"My son loves this DVD, it is funny, maybe not the fully relax yoga, but of course is made for kids and that is how they learn better: having fun. Nice songs and they have kids from 3 to 6, which is good for my [...] to watch that not all the kids make the excercises perfectly.  I will say worth the money",1198800000,3,305,3.8412698412698414
2397497,5,B000AYELBK,"I had Yoga Kids on video tape for my older kids & they enjoyed it a lot, so I got this one for my toddler. He loves it! He tries to follow along & do the yoga (it's so funny). There are some ""classic"" yoga poses modified for little ones and some exercizes that are mostly movement and using imagination rather than poses. The teacher is very fun (looks like she's having fun) and warm and has a kind voice.",1184025600,16,406,4.0875
2397498,5,B000AYELBK,I bought the DVD for my son to help him control his large amounts of energy and for exercise. I found that the DVD was benefitual for me also. There is not much time between changing positions but each one is explained in a fun and educational manner. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in having their children try and perform Yoga,1156118400,15,345,4.40625
2397499,4,B000AYELBK,"My 7 year old has enjoyed this program. Still, I have difficulty keeping up with it. I have been practicing yoga for over two years, and the lack of transitions/ time for transitions (especially prevelant with the ABC yoga-lots of siting, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing again, kneeling, etc..) seems to wear us both out. I prefer a practice that flows from one postion into the other. This one seems very choppy. After thirty minutes, we both seem to give up a bit. That said, the instructor is very lively and funny.",1143244800,51,524,4.769230769230769
2397500,5,B000AYELBK,"My kids absolutely love these videos.  My 5 1/2 year old is a pro already and his little brother, who is two, copies everything he does.  It isn't too long so we can do it every other night or so before bed.  Not a lot of traditional yoga postures like I'm used to on my tapes, but they are fun and get the kids stretching/moving.  Me too!  Definitely glad I bought them and would certainly recommend them.",1140480000,20,406,4.220779220779221
2397501,5,B000AYELBK,"I absolutely love these videos! I have two boys, ages 4 & 6. Both enjoy doing there yoga! They are learning the names of the poses, and actually correct me when I make a mistake on the names! We have been doing yoga for several months now. The boys are ridiculously bendy. They watch me and attempt to 'help' me go into a move more deeply. I cannot do half the stretching those kids do. The dvds are not condescending, they are fun, and they hold my kids interest. I branched out and bought them 'Animal Yoga'. It is horrible. I could never recommend that video. It is cheaper, but it is not worth it.

I look forward to trying Yoga kids 1. I love hearing the boys chanting 'Namaste'! Ah my little Yogis..",1140393600,13,705,4.2611940298507465
2397502,5,B000AYELBK,"I bought these to go with the first DVD release so I'd have a full set of 3. These are a little more difficult for my 2 year old but I'm still happy with them because I know that she'll eventually get more into them. Right now her favorite is the first one. We have watched these too;but, she keeps going back to the first in the series. I'm sure as she grows, we'll move up to the more difficult poses. I'm happy because I can really see her doing this for years to come and it gets me up and moving too. I can see it really helping for anger management and stress release when we get to those issues too. :)",1138492800,41,609,3.959349593495935
2397503,2,B000AYELBK,"My kids love it, but I was hoping for something less spiritual. We skip the chanting and yoga songs. The rest isn't really yoga it's just acting like animals.",1440460800,,158,4.482758620689655

2397508,5,B000AYELBK,"My kids, when they were younger, loved to do these yoga poses with me.  Now, my 7th-grader doesn't do many of the poses, but my 4th grader will still do the Volcano to release frustration and calm down.",1425340800,,202,4.315789473684211
2397509,5,B000AYELBK,I have a 3.5 year old and about to.be 2 year old.....they both enjoy it. The 3 year old absolutely loves doing it and asks for it and.keeps her attention. The 2 year.old attention span is shorter bt her definately likes the sounds etc. and is liking to do exercise. My 3 year old ws the same when smaller. I started it when they.were little and am seeing tht the DVDs really do help get exercise into a part of life for them. Highly suggest it. Will be getting others to vary.,1419033600,,476,4.184782608695652
2397510,1,B000AYELBK,"Not impressed. We have tried watching it several times and my kids just never got into it. I find the instructor annoying, but kept giving it a chance because I hoped my kids would find an interest in yoga. I'll have to keep looking for a different video...this was not something that held their interest at all. My kids are home schooled and usually love videos of this sort, but this was very boring.",1417478400,,402,4.445945945945946

2397513,1,B000AYELBK,"My 3 1/2 yo twins have zero interest in this video.  They do regular yoga with me but some of the poses are just too hard for them and wanted to find something easier for them.  Would not consider this to be a ""yoga"" DVD.  Very disappointed.",1413849600,,241,4.085106382978723
2397514,4,B000AYELBK,"The animal ""facts"" should be ignored. Besides that, my 3 year old loves it. It is a good way to get her to follow visual instructions.",1413158400,,134,4.1923076923076925
2397515,4,B000AYELBK,"If your kids will be willing to participate, than this is the perfect DVD to get! It's hilarious to watch them mimic the yoga moves!",1410220800,,132,4.32
2397516,5,B000AYELBK,"As a mom of spirited twin boys, I love these DVDs. My boys love yoga, and these DVDs keep them engaged and learning. It is important for kids to develop their muscles (especially their core), balance, and to learn positive ways to relax. My boys (who are 4) ask to do their yoga and pull out my mats to get ready. I especially love these DVDs on rainy days when we can't get to the park to release energy!",1406851200,,405,4.139240506329114
2397517,5,B000AYELBK,"We got this for our toddler and her took it to daycare and the whole class enjoyed it. The second video is really the best because it has better animation and an alphabet theme. In the first video there we some video clips of animals like a snake that were a bit scary for young kids, but overall both are a great way to get kids up and moving. The whole class had so much fun that we bought a second copy for teacher's appreciation week. Now the kids do yoga all the time.",1405123200,,473,4.042553191489362
2397518,5,B000AYELBK,My two year old son loves to do this video to get extra energy out!  It is also great for bonding with him (I do it with him),1404691200,,125,3.4642857142857144
2397519,5,B000AYELBK,"My kids love this DVD.  It is fun and had a good mixture of stuff that is easy and challenging for toddlers (One or two of the poses are a little challenging for my husband! ) We use it often to get the sillies out on days were stuck inside.

It's so nice to find something that gets them active AND keeps their short attention spans engaged. Most kids exercise dvds we've tried are either too focused on the workout to keep them engaged or too focused on entertainment and fail to keep them moving.  This is the perfect balance for us.",1399852800,,536,4.235294117647059
2397520,5,B000AYELBK,"My son loves this, asks to watch/do it all the time. Drew him in and had him participating on his own very quickly. Good for all ages. My daughter(infant) enjoys trying to follow along as well.",1389830400,,193,4.388888888888889
2397521,5,B000AYELBK,"This DVD is awesome.  Used it in the classroom when I was a teacher and now use it with my little ones.  It's fun, engaging and easy.",1384819200,,133,3.888888888888889
2397522,5,B000AYELBK,I use these videos during the last 5 minutes of class with my K and 1st grade students. They love the fun poses; I like the educational link to literacy standards.,1378771200,,163,4.290322580645161
2397523,5,B000AYELBK,Children are enjoying this. We have worked it into our morning routine.  Another teacher recommended this product after seeing it used at a camp.,1378166400,,145,5.041666666666667
2397524,4,B000AYELBK,I got it for my 2 year old and she can not do more than 10 min w/o loosing inerest. it too much yet. But we are doing together and she always asks for it.,1372723200,,154,3.4285714285714284
2397525,2,B000AYELBK,"This video is fun... But the lady is odd and its not as good as the original yoga kids. It's harder to follow in my opinion and there is some music and strange poses with strange names, little kids like it though so were keeping it.",1367452800,,232,4.065217391304348
2397526,5,B000AYELBK,"I love these videos. What's more important my kids love it ! These videos are very fun, but also educational. While learning yoga kids also learn fun facts about animals...",1364774400,,172,4.766666666666667
2397527,5,B000AYELBK,"My very active 4-year-old loves these DVDs. She is able to focus  and imitate on the children in the video. By the end she is laying quietly on her back, just breathing.",1361836800,,169,4.28125
2397528,2,B000AYELBK,"I gave it 2 stars because my kids do like the poses... until they get board with it.  I wouldn't call this yoga.  Its just a lady doing things with kids and moving with kids.  But not really yoga poses.  When showing the ""poses"" it goes from kid to kid to instructor then to kid from kid again so fast its hard to know exactly what you are expected to do.  You know those people who have too many pictures on the wall so its hard to look at any of them.  Its like that with every pose.  They just switch the camera from kid to kid.  There is no real guide lines on how to do any of it... and the kids on the movie don't even do it right and they are there with the instructor.  not the best.",1360022400,3,691,3.8439716312056738
2397529,5,B000AYELBK,"I got this DVD set in hopes of finding an indoor exercise activity that I could do with my toddler son (especially during the winter, when it's too dark for us to get out when I get home from work).

My son really enjoys both of these DVDs (though he prefers the ""Silly to Calm"" one over the ABCs). We started doing these when he was about 22 months old, and he mostly ran around the room while they played. He sometimes asks to do yoga, and loves his yoga mat. Now, at 29 months, he's getting better at doing some of the exercises, and even tries to do some of the ones that require balancing on one foot.

The instructor is upbeat and energetic, and does a good job of explaining the exercises in a way that's fun for kids, without being pedantic.

I usually join my son in doing the exercises so that I'm getting some exercise in as well, and since many of the poses are actual yoga poses, I get the benefit of some good stretching. While it is a bit scattered and fast paced for ME (I would prefer to be able to do some slower paced yoga), it runs at the perfect pace for my toddler. The Silly to Calm DVD is about 25 minutes, which is a great length for his attention span.

All in all, I would say that this DVD set was a fantastic investment, and definitely recommend it to parents of toddlers who are looking for some good ways to encourage some exercise on days when getting outside is difficult.",1358985600,,1405,4.192592592592592
2397530,2,B000AYELBK,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and my 7 year old son because they tried yoga and loved it so I thought it would be a great dvd to take on the road so we could do it whenever we wanted.  It was way too fast for them. By the time they got the move the instructor was on to the next move. This DVD is intended for 3-6 year olds.the moves Are easy enough but the pace is just too fast!!,1357603200,2,392,3.611764705882353
2397531,5,B000AYELBK,"I teach elementary school PE class, and my students LOVE both DVDs!  What a terrific and creative way to introduce yoga to young children.  The DVD says ages 3-6, but even my 2nd grade students love both DVDs.  The length of the DVD is perfect; it keeps their attention the entire time.  Marsha is just great (very engaging), and the kids are absolutely adorable.  I think that's part of the reason my 2nd grade students love it.  :) Well done!",1350259200,,444,4.4875
2397532,2,B000AYELBK,"I actually saw this video as a recommendation when I was purchasing Hooked On Phonics for my son who is 6 and having difficulty with reading and phonics. I was on the fence due to the reviews being so mixed so I decided to check it out from my local library, I'm glad I did because it was not as I expected. I think this video is geared towards smaller children learning the alphabet rather then elementary school children learning phonics or to read. Both my children had fun with the video, but when asked if I should buy it after we need to return it I received a resounding no from both, and as I said I was looking for something to help me more with phonics then just the alphabet.",1348444800,,686,4.204545454545454
2397533,5,B000AYELBK,"His attention span isn't strong enough to do the whole thing, by any means, but the parts we've done he's really enjoying.  I think it helps that hey have little kids doing it outside by the ocean (my son does really like the ocean) and they just make it so fun.  My husband and I were doing it with him and we all had a blast!",1327017600,,327,3.9393939393939394
2397534,5,B000AYELBK,"We purchased this for our niece. Our daughter has loved these DVDs since she was 4. It's a wonderful, simple and fun introduction to yoga, proviEding exercise and focus in a very different way.",1325980800,,193,4.705882352941177
2397535,5,B000AYELBK,"I ordered this DVD for my 4 year old boy and 7 year old girl. I expected my calm, yoga-loving, quietly-reading-for-hours 7 year old to like it, but I was unsure what my rough and tumble 4 year old boy would think. We played the DVD as soon as it arrived and BOTH my kids loved it so much they begged to play both DVD's twice in a row. The exercises are very kid-friendly and not too serious. The second time around I joined the kids for the exercises and was a little stiff the next day (LOL!), so I know they're strengthening their muscles and getting some good exercise. Like most yoga practices, the instructor and exercises also laid a foundation for using breathing and relaxation exercises to calm the mind and ""regroup"" emotions. I would definitely recommend these DVD's to anyone!",1312156800,,788,4.5174825174825175
2397536,5,B000AYELBK,So let me start by saying I have an autistic 5 year old and an active 2 year old. My 5 year old just loves doing yoga. It's a nice calming way to get some of the sensory things she needs. These videos have been fantastic for her. The poses are demonstrated well and she loves that kids are doing them. My son has a harder time with them but I think that's more that he's lacking the balance yet. Another year and he'll be a pro like my daughter.,1309219200,,445,3.9555555555555557
2397537,4,B000AYELBK,"I purchased these movies in hopes that it would provide some guided physical activity for children during the long, cold winter months when they couldn't get outside and play. The videos are well produced and well instructed. The yoga poses taught are simple and easy enough for most kids, although some of the balancing may be challenging for children under the age of 4.

However, neither of my children will sit through an entire movie. Both movies start out fun and goofy, with lots of wiggling and animal imitations and then tries to gently wind down its viewers to a more quiet, almost nap time level. My kids lose interest as soon as the poses become more about holding still then jumping around. Every kid is different, so yours may stay engaged.

Overall, I would recommend this video to any parent looking for an inexpensive way of introducing their children to yoga and exercise. There's no need to pay for weekly classes and purchase the accessories, just pop the DVD in and encourage your child to watch. I also recommend that you do the poses with your children, because these videos can be quite the work-out for the parent as well. However, if your children are bundles of energy, they may not make it through the quiet parts.",1307923200,12,1242,4.692660550458716
2397538,5,B000AYELBK,"While many of the movements in the dvds are quick and/or silly, this DVD set really captures the essence of yoga.  Connecting with nature and using breathing to work with our emotional states are taught in a kid friendly fashion.  Also, the ""namaste"" song on the ABC DVD of this set is spiritual and beautiful; my two-year-old daughter sings it all the time.  I find that 1/2 of the DVD is about all that she can attend to for now, but that will change with time.  We do the Yoga ABC's DVD whenever we do yoga during the day because it's energizing, and we do the ""from silly to calm"" DVD at night.  I highly recommend these DVDs for any parents who want their children to learn and grow from yoga.",1294185600,5,698,4.297709923664122
2397539,5,B000AYELBK,"I purchased this set for my child and some friends, and they all love it. I find the instruction a little awkward, however, my daughter was able to do most moves from 3-years-old, and still likes the video. The Silly-to-Calm video has, in my opinion, a better flow that the ABC yoga video. The ABC video has many poses that seem similar, and the silly to calm is more active.",1293667200,6,375,4.371428571428571
2397540,5,B000AYELBK,"My 5 year old daughter loves both of these, especially #3. She took a bit of a dislike to #2 but only because it ends with Zig-zag-breathing: a communal breathing shavasana (lying on each others tummies), and she didn't have anyone else to do it with. I really enjoy doing both of these with her. I never would have thought to get a kid doing calming breathing exercises by pretending to be a rabbit or a monkey! Marsha Wenig is a wonderfully fun instructor.",1290988800,2,458,4.464285714285714
2397541,4,B000AYELBK,We love the video.  The only down side is that there are periods where the transition between poses is too long.  Overall my three year old loves it and my one year old likes to try and copy us.  This is a big improvement for him as he usually screams when we are trying to do yoga!  Maybe it is her tone of voice and the watching all the kids do things.  Over all I would recommend to others.,1285372800,3,393,3.9240506329113924
2397542,5,B000AYELBK,"my kids love these yoga dvds... my son's (4) favorite is the alphabet one, my daughter's (7) favorite is the 'silly to calm'... my favorite part is having them enjoying healthy exercise and stretching -- fantastic!",1284422400,,214,4.972222222222222
2397543,5,B000AYELBK,"This box set includes 2 DVDs. What a deal! Marsha's instructional DVDs are fun for kids less than 5ish, but older kids might still want to try it out anyway. I highly recommend this box set at the sale price!",1282521600,,208,4.225
2397544,4,B000AYELBK,I did this DVD with my 4 year old and he loved it. It was nice to do yoga with my son. It was great to watch him enjoy this so much.,1278028800,,132,3.15625
2397545,4,B000AYELBK,"We have only done the Silly to Calm DVD, but my son enjoys acting like a monkey and standing tall like a tree. It really does calm him down at the end. I prefer it to my Crunch DVD, although it doesn't do much for my waistline. :)",1277424000,,230,3.8125
2397546,5,B000AYELBK,"I started doing yoga approximately three months ago and it has peak my son's interest, so I decided to purchase this DVD so we could do something more age appropriate for him together.  We have such a fun time acting silly together and all the physical movement does give us a workout.  Great for times when it's not convenient for him to play outsides, and anything that bring family and fitness together is a wonderful thing!",1274659200,,427,4.605263157894737
2397547,5,B000AYELBK,"My kids, ages 5 and 3, absolutely love these videos and ask for them over and over. They are a great deal for the price too. The children in the videos range from preschool to early elementary, and that is really the age range these are targeted to. The workouts are a bit long, my kids rarely do an entire DVD in one showing, but that is OK with me. Frankly, they love watching these as much as doing them, so I do use them in the car too for long drives. They find these videos entertaining because the instructor is very silly, and encourages the kids in the video to be that way too.

Per some of the complaints, it's true that many of the poses are not orthodox yoga asanas, and that the workouts do not flow in the way that a good adult class would. I think that is fine, and actually a plus, because these are specifically designed for the attention spans and bodies of young children. So if you are looking for a DVD to do alongside your child, these probably aren't it. But if you just want something entertaining that will whet their whistle for yoga, you can't beat these.",1268092800,2,1083,4.257281553398058
2397548,5,B000AYELBK,"I ordered this for my 21 month daughter and me to have a fun yoga video. She is still a bit young to really enjoy it, but I love it. I can tell that she will love it too when she gets just a bit older. The poses and set up of the DVD are fun and silly; and watching other kids in different poses seems to intrigue her. She'll be doing her own versions and moving and shaking before too long. It was a GREAT price for a fun family yoga DVD set.",1260576000,,443,3.723404255319149
2397549,4,B000AYELBK,"This DVD is bright and fun.  It keeps everything short and simple to accommodate short attention spans of little kids.  It shows different kids doing the poses in different ways.  I think it encourages trying out new things and not worrying about getting it right the first time.  A lot of poses I don't recognize from my yoga practice... but they all are good for moving, stretching, and laughing.",1257206400,2,398,4.72463768115942
2397550,4,B000AYELBK,I like this dvd because the whole family can excercise together and also have fun. it is also educational and combines learning with physical activity.,1254787200,2,151,5.08
2397551,5,B000AYELBK,"I've never tried yoga via dvd before but, my 3 old seemed to be really interested in the yoga book I have- I bought this for her.- It didn't keep her interested in but, my 6 yr old really liked it. She did both discs pretty easily -and for being very excitable child- she really like the calming parts. I would suggest this disc for parent to buy who's open minded and comfortable will being silly and active.",1252108800,,409,4.256410256410256
2397552,5,B000AYELBK,"This DVD is a great alternative to passive TV watching.  It exposes kids to a creative and active way of using their bodies.  It develops self-awareness and body-awareness.  The creator states that instead of telling kids to do something (like ""calm down"" ""chill out"" or ""get some exercise""), it shows them how to do it, and the DVD suceeds.",1243296000,,341,4.745762711864407
2397553,1,B000AYELBK,"This DVD is a nice concept, but isn't easy to follow. The routine is all over the place. Sit, stand, lay, stand then sit again...Not user friendly especially for children.",1242864000,5,171,4.733333333333333
2397554,5,B000AYELBK,"I got these for my daughter when she was two, and she was eager to watch them and do the poses a couple of times per week for months.  She's still eager to watch these intermittently, and at five years old still loves them.  There aren't really smooth transitions between poses, but I don't think small children necessarily need smooth transitions as long as the dialogue captures their interest- which it does.  I even enjoyed the interview with Marsha Wenig about how children do many of these poses through play and pretending.  It's perfect also for days when children have lots of energy but outside isn't an option.",1238803200,,621,4.722222222222222
2397555,5,B000AYELBK,My son is 4 and loves these videos - although his favorite of the 2 is the alphabet dvd.  He loves watching other kids doing the poses too.,1234137600,,139,3.9642857142857144
2397556,4,B000AYELBK,I bought some yoga Dvds for my sister to try with her kids. I would say that its a little more advanced for the younger ones but they still loved seeing the kids play and have a good time on the tv. Falling over doing poses so cute! FUN,1231286400,3,236,3.836734693877551
2397557,5,B000AYELBK,I bought this for my 4 year old Granddaughter and we love it.  Thank you.,1225584000,,73,3.8666666666666667
2397558,5,B000AYELBK,"My 4 year old daughter loves it. When Mommy does her yoga she can do some of the exercises,too. Many times she just gets it out and does a section on her own. She is so flexible, I wish I had this when I was a child. Very simple to follow, and fun for the parent to do together.",1216944000,2,278,3.7288135593220337
2397559,4,B000AYELBK,"My son loves this DVD set!  When it is too hot and humid to go outside he pops it in and does Silly to Calm to get his wiggles out.  I don't even have to remind him he has it, he does it all by himself.  My only complaint is that one of the DVDs is slightly off, the intro is scrambled, but it doesn't affect the work-out part of the video so no big deal.  I would definitely recommend this set to anyone with young children.",1216598400,2,425,3.8505747126436782
2397560,3,B000AYELBK,"The video incorporates different kinds of postures in a fun way. However, I think a 40 min non-stop sessions is too long to hold any 3-5 year old's interest. Instead, if different routines, each at the most 10 min. long had been presented it would have been better. A parent could guide the child do those, or even accompany the child doing them. And by having different routines there would also have been more variety for the child.
My three year old grand son soon lost interest and moved away to play with some other toys.",1216252800,9,526,4.489583333333333
2397561,4,B000AYELBK,I bought this for my little home daycare and have found it to be the most popular video in my collection to them. The two-year-olds especially ask for it all the time. It's a great way to keep them active when it's too hot to go outside.,1212969600,7,237,4.0638297872340425
2397562,5,B000AYELBK,"I got this for my kids and they LOVE it.  They are 5 and 3 years old.  I was looking for a way we could spend Quiet time.  I am a yoga junkie myself.  This is great, because they are quiet and getting exercise.  They love doing this together so I bought the other 2 yoga kids DVD's as well.  We rotate all 3 of the DVD's and do 2 a night before bed!  They talk about the poses during the day and I have seen them get better each time they practice.  Get these for your kids for sure.  I also bought them kid yoga mats which makes it easier (and more fun!).  This would be a great gift for a toddler with the yoga mat.",1210723200,,617,3.7874015748031495
8080766,5,B000AYELBK,"I use this with my 3.5 year old. She adores it and loves to do ""yoga"". She loves these so much she asks for them. Her favorite is the ABC Yoga and she barely needs help.
I love that the way this is a simple and fun way to get used to following directions not just from Mom. She does well on almost all the poses they teach, especially inthe ABC Yoga. We generally do ABC Yoga and then if she requests we do/watch  Silly to Calm Yoga.
I highly recommend these videos. Younger children can learn with help until they can to do the poses almost. Great for teaching to kids and fun for them.",1499126400,,587,4.060344827586207

8080768,5,B000AYELBK,Very fun and easy to follow video for kids. My daughter loves when we pull out the yoga mat and she gets to be big like me. It's great for play dates too because my daughter loves feeling like a little teacher and helping her friends. Sometimes when she tries to do my videos with me she gets frustrated with the complicated moves so this is a perfect solution.,1472860800,,361,4.246376811594203

8080772,4,B000AYELBK,"The videos do a good job introducing yoga poses  to kids. In my case, my 3 yo toddler. The quick pace is  perfect for kids. My only complaint is that the instructor moves way to quickly through the poses. I wish she held each step two or three beats longer. My daughter couldn't keep up. I had to pause the video so she could She still enjoyed it",1458691200,,346,4.073529411764706
