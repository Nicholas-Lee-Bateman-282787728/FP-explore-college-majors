8600720,1,B00E3RA3Q2,"'The Wackers' is British comedy's darkest long night of the soul. It is desperately, clenchingly  unfunny.
Not much more to be said: acting's appalling; script situations are murderously crass and over-familiar..
Worst of all, it's the only TV series I've ever seen that actually hates it's own characters.

Howl at the overwrought gurning and gesticulating as the forced 'humour' is squeezed out.. Double-up at the skint scousers' outside lavvy, and the hysterically inventive jokes therewith.. Fall on the floor in fits at 'impish' Keith Chegwin and his..well, just at him, really.
Beam warmly as grandad lusts after his own teenage grand-daughter.. Eeww, wait !

Best you can say about this gormless series is that it's completely PC-free, but that on it's own isn't enough. Even that has to be disingenuous, blimpish, strike deserved targets.. 'The Wackers' is too busy being bogged down by its overtly contemptuous sneering at 70's northern working class-ness to be bothered with any of that.
Subtlety-wise, and on every other comedy base, it makes 'On The Buses' look like 'M. Hulot's Holiday'.

Poor, poor Alison Steadman.

I'm struggling..
Just no on every level.",1508025600,,1171,5.240641711229946
