8139745,1,B000HH4PMU,"I purchased this video under false premises. Had I known that Martin Sheen had anything to do with this project I wouldn't have touched it with a 10 ft pole. I speak as a three time OIF veteran, served at LSA Anaconda in 2005, 2006, and 2007. I have nothing but respect for the US Marines and the jobs they do ""outside the wire"". This movie does show the hell they face and show the marines as they hero's they are, but make no mistake this is an Anti-War Propoganda film! I 100% regret buying it! Martin Sheen is a well known and well documented anti-war activist. You will make convient note that NO WHERE ON THE COVER OF THIS MOVIE DOES IT SHOW HIS NAME! However the entire film is narrated by him.

If you want to get a get a good unbiased view I recommend the OUTSIDE THE WIRE Series by JD Johannes. Former Marine and television news producer JD Johannes produced this video. It shows the real thing without the political agenda!

The producers and technical experts were kind enough to collaborate with me in training chaplains and assistants in San Diego a few years back and this film helped several participants to process what they had experienced.

8139747,5,B000HH4PMU,"That was an excellent film! I can't believe what those guys went through or how they made it outta there alive! Most of the Marines in there seemed like outstanding and courageous young men. Everyone of them except that Lance Corporal Ringo character. I almost gave it 3 stars because of that funny guy. They should have never let that freak out of the service, maybe even lock his crazy butt up for good! Oh well, just keep that guy at an arms distance away everyone. 5 stars all the way people, GET SOME!
