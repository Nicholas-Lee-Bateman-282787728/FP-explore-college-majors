4643813,5,B005BL5D8W,"I'm a high school athlete and this workout is great to get me in shape for any season! I'm not a cheerleader, and I think that the moves and music is not only providing a high intensity workout, but is fun too. I do the workout a lot, and it never gets old. I would recommend this workout for anyone, especially because it's led by such a great trainer who keeps you motivated and strong. I love how its a total body workout, because it improves my strength as well as endurance.",1324425600,4,479,4.217391304347826
4643814,5,B005BL5D8W,"Stacey's DVD is geared toward cheerleaders BUT I'm a 31 year old who just likes to get in a good work out with lots of cardio. If you're looking for fun music and moves, a friendly, motivated teacher who really knows what she is doing and a great workout that will have you sweating your butt off, then this is definitely the workout DVD for you! I highly recommend it for cheerleaders, teenagers, and adults who want to stay in shape. I even got my husband to do it!!!",1324425600,4,469,4.280898876404494
4643815,5,B005BL5D8W,I am a high school strength coach and this video is a must have for any high school cheerleading team......actually any female sports team.  The exercise selection and intensity of the workout benefits ALL athletes.  For a team all you need is space....pop it in and let Stacey do the rest. Informative and extremely practical for a large group or an individual.  Good Luck and Stay Strong!,1324425600,2,390,4.791044776119403
4643816,5,B005BL5D8W,"If you have read one of Stacey DelPreore's many magazine articles on cheerleading  (and I have!),  then you already know how effectively and powerfully she communicates the  idea that cheering is a sport.  In these print articles, Stacey clearly outlines and explains the techniques needed for a well-conditioned ""cheerleading athlete"" to excel and perform to their max.  Those articles were on paper.  Now, imagine these techniques jumping off the page and coming alive on your TV screen via the Train2Cheer DVD!  I have had the pleasure of attending Stacey's fitness classes and can say with certainty that no one pushes you to your limits better than she does ---and amazingly, you have fun doing it!  :-))))))",1324339200,2,713,5.086206896551724
4643817,4,B005BL5D8W,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this workout from the publicist.

As the title of the DVD suggests, Train2Cheer is a workout designed to help cheerleaders enhance their cardio and muscular endurance in order to improve their cheerleading performance.  The non-stop, high impact workout is choreographed to an energetic soundtrack featuring many well-known artists such as Jordin Sparks, RuPaul, and The Black Eyed Peas; in fact, a separate music CD soundtrack is included.  The workout is taught by Stacey DelPreore; Stacey is joined by two background exercisers, Allison Guarneiri and Ryan Jackson.  The three are exercising on a elevated platform in front of a live, participatory audience of about 20 teenaged young women.

Stacey offers both a short introduction as well as a technique introduction section which reviews some of the moves included in the workout.  The Main Menu appears as follows:  Play Workout from Beginning - Track by Track - Play Exercise Techniques (6.5 minutes) - Replay Introduction - Play Bonus Track-Lower Body

There are 10 Total Tracks, plus the Bonus Lower Body track.  I have listed each track (names are as given on the back of the DVD case), provided approximate times, and offered a brief description of each.

TRACK 1, WARM UP (5.5 MINS)
Stacey begins with step-claps, moving into step-punch and the step-curl.  She adds in a march forward and back and side steps with ""touchdown"" arms.

TRACK 2, LOW IMPACT CARDIO (4 MINS)
Although this segment was described as ""low impact,"" Stacey starts right in with jogs with pom-pom arms and eventually goes to jumping jacks.  (A cue does appear on screen saying that you can keep the moves on the ground if you wish.)  Other moves include grapevine with a squat a grapevine with a jack.

TRACK 3, HIGH INTENSITY CARDIO (3.5 MINS)
This section starts with a gallop from side-to-side, adding in high knees and cross-jacks.

TRACK 4, MIXED INTERVAL (4.5 MINS)
Here Stacey moves through a little interval:  alternating step front kicks, step side knee with grapevine, alternating knees, straight leg front kick, jogs, side leaps, and jack squats; the sequence is repeated several times.

TRACK 5, UPPER BODY (4.5 MINS)
For this segment, Stacey is alone on stage, and she leads the group through several sets of push-ups.  She begins with walking full-arm plank, then moves into push-ups.  After a brief stretch, she repeats this sequence several times.

TRACK 6, EXTREME CARDIO (3.5 MINS)
This cardio sequence starts with heels up, jogs, shuffles with ""V"" arms, and single knees up; again, the sequence is repeated several times.

TRACK 7, EXPLOSIVE REFLEX (5.5 MINS)
Stacey adds plyometric movements to this segments.  She begins with small hops side-to-side.  Moving in rounds, she performs jogs, jump squats, and jump lunges.  For the final round, Stacey concludes with squat thrusts (aka burpees) and mountain climbers.

TRACK 8, JUMP CARDIO (4 MINS)
This section starts with ""tick tock"" (heel taps).  This is followed by a moving knee repeater forward, a ski jump side to side, and finally, spread eagle jumps.

TRACK 9, CORE (3.5 MINS)
Stacey and crew head to the floor here for several variations on crunches, including both bent and straight leg versions.

TRACK 10, STRETCH & FLEXIBILITY (3.5 MINS)
The stretches begin on the floor for moves like reclined twist and seated straddle.  Eventually, Stacey moves to standing to conclude with a few additional stretches such as the standing quad stretch and triceps stretch.

BONUS LOWER BODY (4 MINS)
Stacey is again alone here, with no background exercisers and no audience.  She starts with static rear lunges, also performing rear lunges and repeater knees.  After performing several sets on the same side, she switches to the other leg.  She concludes the workout with a few brief sets of squats/pulsing squats.

Although I found this workout fun and different to do once, it is not something I would do regularly, in part because the cardio was too high impact for my liking, and in part because as a 40-something home exerciser, I am clearly NOT the intended audience.  However, I DO think that this DVD could be quite effective if used as a training tool for cheerleaders, dance teams, or even as part of high school gym classes.  With those caveats, I would recommend the workout.",1315872000,13,4327,5.008403361344538
8464048,5,B005BL5D8W,Love this workout video and use it with my high school cheerleaders for summer conditioning.  Would love to have a Train2Cheer #2.,1451433600,,130,4.909090909090909
8464049,2,B005BL5D8W,"After reading all the awesome reviews we were super excited to try this workout. I would not compare this to P90X at all. I've done P90X twice and this is in no way as good. The music was mediocre at best. Yes it's from big name artists, but if it doesn't get you pumped, then what's the point?! Some of the music I didn't even recognize. If you are new to exercise this would be for you. If you have done other workouts like P90X and Insanity, pass this one by. You will be bored. I was.",1406160000,,488,4.041237113402062
8464050,4,B005BL5D8W,My little 7 year old loves this workout tape.  She does all star cheerleading and loves this video fpr non cheer days.  Enough variation to be interesting.,1399852800,,155,4.703703703703703
8464051,4,B005BL5D8W,"I love this work out! I am an avid runner, hiker and work out at the gym at least 5-7 days a week. This is perfect to switch things up, confuse the muscles and get some great cardio in! I use this on days that I don't have the time to get ready for the gym, or to hit the trails. Super fun and definitely get you sweating!!! I totally recommend this! Not for the weak at heart!",1376438400,,377,3.8461538461538463
8464052,5,B005BL5D8W,"I was a cheerleader for 6 years when I was younger. Now, two kids later, I needed a workout that was fun, easy to do, and affective. This workout is super fun and kicks my butt every day! Very happy with the product.",1365465600,2,216,4.046511627906977

8464054,5,B005BL5D8W,"First off I didn't just see this online my sister bought one and I thought it would be dumb like any other cheerleading video, but I'm very critical because I'm working on becoming a trainer so when I say something works I'm right. The music makes it fun, its high energy and after I finish it my abs feel nice and tight. Its difficult to find a workout to really concentrate on good ab training and this workout is the best I've replaced this as my main cardio workout. Try it!",1347321600,,478,4.263736263736264
8464055,5,B005BL5D8W,My daughter loves this new workout.  Cant say enough about it.  Music is great- never had a workout dvd with this good of music.,1329004800,,128,4.291666666666667
8464056,5,B005BL5D8W,"I was given Train2 Cheer from a friend for Christmas and have been obsessed ever since!  It is a high enery, intense and most importantly fun video!  You don't even realize how much you are sweating until you complete the video! As someone who finished the P90x workout last year, it is so great  to find a video just as challenging but MORE FUN!  I know what I am getting my friends for their birthdays this year!",1326412800,2,414,4.337662337662338
8464057,5,B005BL5D8W,"TRAIN2Cheer is a 45 minute cardio and strength training workout that can be used by EVERYONE...NOT JUST CHEERLEADERS AND DANCERS.  While I do agree that this is a great workout for cheerleaders individually or as a team to build stamina and strength, this DVD is a MUST for anyone who wants a HIGH ENERGY, FUN FULL BODY workout.  There are 10 tracks, each with great music and a variety of choreographed exercises.  Each routine is repeated a few times.  With Stacey's upbeat and motivating pesonality, you will definitely NOT get bored.  I am 36 years old and have done many workout videos.  This DVD is definitely a favorite!",1325980800,4,627,4.7592592592592595
