8078880,5,B000AMATGI,All of my little kiddos have loved this video.  It's simple and sweet with great music and colorful videos.  Enjoy!,1359936000,,115,4.7
8078881,5,B000AMATGI,"This truely is a great DVD about prayers in 7 differnt languages, seperate them one at a time or listen to them all in a row. My grandson loves to watch this everytime he come over. He picked up the sign of the cross the very first time he watch it
(1 1/2) and did it the correct way instead of going backwards first.
Highley recommend for any catholic family or anyone wanting to learn how to say prayers.",1278374400,,406,4.151898734177215
8078882,5,B000AMATGI,"If you are in any way concerned about instilling Catholic values into your child, then this is a great way to start early.  My son loves the music.

Obviously, the person who wrote the only negative review has a Catholic axe to grind and a lot of time on their hands to grind it.",1196380800,,279,4.148148148148148
8078883,5,B000AMATGI,"This DVD is a ""must have"" for serious Catholic families with small children. It's also a great tool for grandparents who are concerned about children who are not getting enough prayer. Holy Baby has taught three of our children to recite prayers of the rosary. Thanks to this DVD, we have a three year old who can cross herself and recite the Sign of the Cross in Latin! Our entire family loves this DVD. It will surely help mold a more prayerful and faitful culture, one child at a time.",1139875200,2,488,4.433333333333334
8078884,1,B000AMATGI,"This was one of the biggest disappointments I have purchased lately. No - make that the second biggest disappointment - Holy Baby vol. 2 is even worse.

If you are a Catholic parent who wants to enrich their child with prayer, the in my opinion, this isn't the way to do it. How schizophrenic to rattle off prayers in the background while the kids watch images on the screen of stuffed snakes, sunglasses-wearing flowers, mooing cows and rubber ducks.

Some Christians believe that Catholics just ""rattle"" off their prayers (ie. rosary) - well, this is proof that we do. The whole video is mindless. Granted, the kids love it but what infant or toddler DOESN'T love watching videos? They are captivated regardless of what is on the screen.

The company would have done far better to incorporate HOLY prayers with HOLY images - that would have been reasonable. Dump the bobble-head Jesus and the woodcarved hippie.

Incorporate more crosses, crucifixes, and stained glass windows.

What they show while the prayers are being said is pretty much similar to a book with words talking about colors and showing numbers on all the pages instead. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

If I want my child to learn a Hail Mary or a Glory Be, I want them to see holy images that correspond to those prayers - not balls and bobble heads and turtles on wheels. Honestly.

We purchased our copies of both Holy Baby 1 and Holy Baby 2, viewed them, and then tossed them both in the trash.",1137369600,20,1464,4.651162790697675
8078885,5,B000AMATGI,"This is an excellent DVD - for children of all ages [and grownups too!].  We bought this DVD almost 3 years ago for our then baby - and found that it captivated our whole family.

It is very interesting to babies in the same way that the ""baby einstein"" line is interesting - it really captures their attention with the music and bright photography and children.  But our older children really loved it too - and it really helped them learn their prayers!  Now, we have another baby - and the baby who grew up with Holy Baby is now almost 3 and STILL loves it.  :)

The fact that all the prayers are also offered in 7 languages is icing on the cake - studies show that exposure to foreign languages as babies helps children when they go to learn the languages later on.  And with our older kids who are already learning Spanish [and starting on Latin], they really love learning the prayers in those languages.  And its really impressive when they can say the Our Father in Latin for Grandma. :) :)

All in all, this is a *phenomial* DVD - we have given countless copies away as Christening, Birthday, and Christmas gifts.  Every family we've given one to has had the same results we have with all the children just loving it - everyone has been thrilled.

I hope the Rosary Project folks come out with more DVDs along these lines - this one is truly excellent!",1128902400,,1361,4.382470119521912
