8692040,5,B00QMWEHS6,"It's great to have these all together although HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME isn't any good. I bought it primarily for DEEP RISING, Which looks and sounds terrific. I'd always been on the fence with  THE PUPPET MASTERS but I did enjoy it. Of course WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is a classic thriller that looks and sounds great too.  It was priced so well that I just couldn't resist. Like I mentioned earlier, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME isn't good at all and its most definitely not worthy of having a 5.1 soundtrack. That should have been done for THE PUPPET MASTERS, which only received a 2.0 track. I know a 5.1 track exists but why it didn't make it is beyond me. The 2.0  is good but 5.1 would've been much better.",1436227200,,698,4.312977099236641
8692041,5,B00QMWEHS6,"I love having Deep Rising and Happy Birthday to Me on BluRay now.
And HBTM has the original music! Awesome!!!!
Highly recommended, oh, and the other 2 movies were pretty cool too.",1434585600,,179,4.625
8692042,4,B00QMWEHS6,This is a repackaging of the same previously released double features. I think all 4 films are great thrillers. There are several reviews of all of these films but I just wanted to confirm this is a repackage cash grab and the only reason to get it is if you don't already own these gems on blu ray or if you need shelf space for your single disc blu ray release shelf :),1432944000,,371,4.095890410958904
8692043,4,B00QMWEHS6,"Mill Creek Entertainment continues doing what they do best with their Blu-ray Horror 4-in-1 Collection. The company takes movies and television shows which have a specialized or limited fan base and make them readily available. We get a wonderful mix of suspense, action, and sci-fi with this latest offering which includes Deep Rising, The Puppet Masters, When a Stranger Calls, and Happy Birthday to Me.

In ""Deep Rising,"" a newly unveiled ocean liner called the Argonautica sets out on its first cruise only to encounter dangers both on board and in the ocean depths. While the beautiful thief Trillian (Famke Janssen) attempts to steal riches from the boat's wealthy passengers, the ship encounters major problems, most notably a giant murderous sea creature with tentacles. Eventually, a boat captained by John Finnegan (Treat Williams) comes across the Argonautica, and everyone struggles to survive the monster.

""The Puppet Masters"" tells the story of an alien spacecraft that sets down in rural Iowa. Top-secret government agents Andrew Nivens (Donald Sutherland) and his son, Sam (Eric Thal), are sent to investigate. Coming along is NASA biologist Mary Sefton (Julie Warner), and together they make a startling discovery: alien parasites capable of taking over the minds of human beings. And the creatures are multiplying. The race is on for the team to stop the invaders before they turn all of humanity into zombie slaves.

A retired police detective (Charles Durning) hunts a deranged British seaman out to re-create a baby sitter's (Carol Kane) horror in ""When a Stranger Calls.""

""Happy Birthday to Me"" revolves around preppie Virginia (Melissa Sue Anderson). Could she be the one skewering classmates who skipped her birthday party years before?

Each of the movies in the Horror 4-in-1 Collection merits their own cult status for one reason or another. The grossly underrated Deep Rising is one of Writer / Director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing) first films. The Puppet Masters is a rather faithful adaptation of Robert A. Heinleins (Starship Troopers) novel.

When a Stranger Calls is a minimalistic suspense thriller starring a young Carol Kane and already well-known supporting actor Charles Durning which spawned a sequel and remake. Happy Birthday to Me made audiences wonder if little Melissa Sue Anderson from Little House on the Prairie really could be the one behind so many brutal killings in the 1980 slasher classic.

All of the movies are barebones releases except for Deep Rising. It comes with a theatrical trailer included. Rarely do Mill Creek Entertainments Blu-rays or DVDs come with extra features, which is why they're always affordable.

Every movie in the Horror 4-in-1 Collection is rated R for different reasons. None of the films contain any nudity. Most of them feature violence, gore, profanity, alcohol, drugs, smoking, and frightening and intense sequences.

The Horror 4-in-1 Collection is perfect for a long night of thrills and action entertainment. Theres something for everyone whether they like creature features, aliens, stalkers, or slashing killers. The 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s are all well exhibited in these genre touchstones.",1428883200,,3196,5.312871287128713
