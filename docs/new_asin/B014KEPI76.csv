7414003,4,B014KEPI76,"Chaika: The Coffin Princess is a fun little anime series animated by studio BONES and has in total 22 episodes, the first 12 being in season 1. The animation is nothing all that special, but is good enough that I can't form any real complaints. I just wish that they put a little more effort into the action sequences. Aside from that the story and characters are interesting enough that you'll want to keep watching until the very end of the show. However, I have to warn you that while season 1 is fun and entertaining, season 2 is anything but that. Aside from being way too short at a measly  10 episodes, I found myself yelling at the screen on multiple occasions because of the ridiculous actions the characters would take. The smart and cunning characters from season 1 turned into drooling morons before my very eyes at the mere convenience of the plot. Chaika is turned into nothing but a thing to be retrieved since she is captured in just about every episode making the episodes feel redundant and boring. Plus, there is not a single villain that feels threatening or interesting in the slightest. They're annoying at best and the worst part is that the plot continuously expects us to believe that they could repeatedly trick our protagonists. The writing is dull, boring, and lazy to the highest degree, so if people are walking into this expecting a full, complete, and entertaining story then think again because while season 1 is pretty good, season 2 is one of the worst things I've ever had to sit through in order to finish a show.",1442534400,16,1550,4.615942028985507
8731098,5,B014KEPI76,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this fantasy action anime.  The story is different enough to be interesting but what really shines about it are the endearing characters and their interactions and relationships with one another.  Chaika has a nice balance of drama, action, humor, and even a little bit of romance too.  It has a story you want to take seriously but you will also be entertained and find yourself chuckling throughout the show.  Animation-wise, I appreciated that it was well done with fighting scenes that weren't full of still frames.  And although I've not watched enough of the dub to really determine how well that was done, I absolutely love the Japanese voices.  The cast did an excellent job.  This season of the anime ends on a very high note but clearly doesn't conclude as far as the main story goes so I imagine those who enjoyed this will want to watch season 2 as well.

Definitely, I will also be adding season 2 to my collection.",1505001600,,963,4.65680473372781

8731104,4,B014KEPI76,"When a 14-year old sorceress named Chaika Trabant, who carries a coffin on her back, meets the out of work saboteur Toru Acura in the woods, they save each other from a vicious Unicorn. Surprisingly adept in casting high-precision spells, Chaika has no memory of her past. The only thing she knows is she must gather the scattered remains of the former ruler, Emperor Gaz, her father, from the eight hero warriors who slew and dismembered him at the end of the war five years past. A powerful wizard who ruled for 500 years, his body parts hold immense magical power and are coveted by many who would use that magic for their own ends. Toru, who works with his adoptive sister Akari, make a pact with Chaika to recover her fathers remains so she may give him a proper burial and finally mourn his death. After defeating the Dragoon Fredrika and then recruiting the shape shifting girl to their cause, the unlikely trio, and their Dragoon, guided by a mysterious young man named Guy, set out on their journey with a clear goal in mind, unaware of a very dangerous truth.

First, let me say I don't review Anime like many who just gives Four or Five Stars a show and provide no explanation why it was good, nor do I compare one Anime to another when there is no comparison to be made. Anime is a genre that kind of does its own thing, and good shows deserve praise, while others deserve to be removed from the face of the planet. That being said, I have to say there is some very interesting story telling in this series. I mean there's nothing overly spectacular or particularly mind blowing about this series, but it is a lot of fun to watch. It does however have a pretty unique plot line. What makes the series so enjoyable and endearing is a combination of elements that flow nicely together. Such as Chaika's innocence and speech patterns, so child like, and broken, yet still clearly understandable. It has some good fighting and action sequences that add to the experience, but the show does not rely on them to tell the story. A decent pace that allows for character development that is not so fast paced as to leave the viewer behind, yet not so slow as to stall. A plot twist towards the middle of the series, that will all of a sudden have you asking the question ""Where is this going?"" This culminates at the end, not so much with a full explanation, but at least enough of one to make you want to watch the next season. With some interesting bad guys, who may not be all that bad, but still on opposite sides of our protagonists, some truly evil bad guys, and some self righteous good guys on a mission, the lines of who is doing the right thing gets a little blurred, while the heroes stay true to their cause. The artwork is crisp, and the musical score is subtle and well rounded. The voice acting is decent and there is some really funny, as well as serious dialog in the script making for a good, solid, and entertaining show. The only down side is that season 2 has yet to be released in English Dub. So unless you are like me and don't mind subtitles in your anime, or actually sometimes prefer it, then you may not get to see season 2 for a while. All in all this is a good series as far as a fantasy anime......",1461456000,,3232,4.368770764119601
