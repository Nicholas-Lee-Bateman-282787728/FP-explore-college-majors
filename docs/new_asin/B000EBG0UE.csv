8597302,5,B000EBG0UE,"A couple of months ago, when looking on Youtube, i noticed a film called Lamb TV: Volume1. I loved the video clips and my friend had a copy of this on DVD. Never have I laughed so hard! Some of the stuff was gross (deficating in front of a store, a guy puking up milk), some bizarre (lighting a doll on fire, a doll talking about death), and some just hilarious (a guy falling in a Taco Bell, and the end credits - great), but it was all funny. Watch this film. Just be careful of Chef Lush! I'm still laughing after watching that!",1142899200,3,531,4.115384615384615
8597303,5,B000EBG0UE,"About the only thing that can be safely said about 'Lamb TV Volume 1' is that it is definitely an acquired taste. You will be either delighted or appalled by the masochisticly odd antics contained in this film, and if you ever needed proof that there is a distinct cultural divide existing in this nation today, 'Lamb TV' provides it in spades. Personally, I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humor is both in dialog and visual, and the timing is impeccable.",1142899200,3,563,4.371428571428571
8597304,5,B000EBG0UE,"It's short, about 65 minutes total, but it is absolutely HILARIOUS. All of the pain and shame that goes into this is genuine. My favorite bits being Chef Lush and that dancing doll scene. ""Lamb TV"" goes way beyond the limits MTV sets for their shows, that's for sure. Fans will not be disappointed. This film had me in stitches before the opening credits had even begun. And it just got better and better. If you're a Jackass or ALI-G fan, then this is the craze at their best.",1142812800,3,477,4.370786516853933
8597305,5,B000EBG0UE,"Before one more person goes off on how crazy or weird you have to be to find the humor in this movie, I'm not a stupid individual and I am not 10 years old, either. My IQ is much higher than an 85. I have a great appreciation for excellence in comedy. The Kids in the Hall was pure cleverness and creativity, Mystery Science Theater 3000 was sheer brilliance, and the men of Monty Python had acres of keen intelligence and comedic wit. But just try telling me that ""A Need To Deficate"" wasn't hilarious...I think there are 26 shorts videos, all different in their own way. Lamb TV defies just about every set law of filmmaking. It is rude, it is crude, and it is hilarious. I can't really think of words to describe this film as none do so adequately. Basically it is ""Candid Camera"" meets ""The Bizarre"" meets ""ALI-G"".",1142812800,3,818,4.3881578947368425
8597306,5,B000EBG0UE,"If you like the Ali G Show, Punkt' or Jackass, you must own this DVD. You will laugh till you're sick in the stomach and cry like a kid who lost his teddy bear!",1142553600,2,160,3.735294117647059
