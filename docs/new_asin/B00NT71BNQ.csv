6678889,1,B00NT71BNQ,"Yes, a real stinker! A poor-man's knock-off of the ""Home Alone"" movies. Very poor acting, poor voice insertion for Grumpy Cat, poor dialogue and amateur plot line. Sorry, Grumpy Cat! Don't give up your day job!",1514246400,,210,4.861111111111111

6678891,3,B00NT71BNQ,Has to be the worst goofy movie ever. The cat voice is totally wrong so it sets the movie up incorrectly and therefore it's not nearly as funny as it could have been.,1514160000,,166,4.0606060606060606
6678892,3,B00NT71BNQ,"Insert Grumpy Cat Meme about how this should just go away.  To be fair, I did not watch most of this, mostly because it was just as awful as you are imagining it would be. My daughter thought it was very funny and loved the grumpy kitty, so I guess its all relative to the audience. PS- I don't know what you expect Grumpy Cat to sound like, but Im this show Grumpy Catvsoubds like a teen aged Valley Girl. In my mind, thats completely wrong. Not that it mattered, would have been pretty nauseating either way.",1514073600,,510,4.257731958762887

6678909,5,B00NT71BNQ,"Loved it, and I'm in my 60s. and my 5 yr old grandson watches it over & over again. I got this DVD as soon as it came out in 2014 after watching it on the Lifetime channel. Great for all ages, lots of laughs. A movie for entertainment purposes. Wish there were more like these being made. So many are too serious, bloody, over digitized with action & color they are hard to focus comfortably on....It you like 'just for the fun of it movies', you'll like this one.",1512086400,,464,4.166666666666667

6678947,4,B00NT71BNQ,"I loved the first half of this movie way more than I expected.  Aubrey Plaza as Grumpy Cat is brilliant!  I love the way she tears down the third wall at times.  All in all the movie doesn't take itself too seriously which is just the right tone for this meme inspired holiday madcap adventure.  The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that as the movie progresses the other characters start to have more prominence than Grumpy Cat.  That's a mistake in my book.  More Grumpy Cat!  Seriously, we need more Grumpy Cat.",1486857600,,529,4.447916666666667

6678953,5,B00NT71BNQ,"This movie is ""bad"" in the same way that Cinderella III is ""bad""; while it's a corporate cash-in, it was obviously made by people who cared about the product they were making and decided to have fun with it. Fourth-wall jokes, self-deprecation about the constant marketing (while still hitting you with constant marketing), and a story that has little to do with Christmas, and a really, really darn cute cat. It's silly-fun, and I plan on making this a Christmas tradition.",1486080000,2,474,4.864197530864198
6678954,4,B00NT71BNQ,"I honestly didn't care for it too much. However the kids absolutely loved it. Hard to review a movie without telling about the storyline (which I won't do).

6678984,2,B00NT71BNQ,I hate to say it but this movie is just bad. The Grumpy voice is irritating and intrusive and makes the flow of the movie jumpy and hard to follow. I love Grumpy cat but she needs a better vehicle!,1484006400,,197,3.95
6678985,5,B00NT71BNQ,Movie is so cute.  We love it,1484006400,,29,3.142857142857143

My girlfriend and I didn't exactly attend to it, but the kitty is adorable so if you don't mind sparing the cash or you have kids that will watch anything with a cute cat. GO FOR IT. ha.",1483574400,,298,4.067796610169491
6679003,4,B00NT71BNQ,"The first thing to remember is this is a kids movie, it doesn't have any side humor in it designed for adults like other kids movies. If you're ok with that it's a decent movie. I laughed a few times which is more than I can say for some comedies. I do love grumpy cat though, and I wasn't expecting much from what I'd been told by others. But I liked it and would watch it again.",1483574400,,380,3.948051948051948

6679006,3,B00NT71BNQ,"This movie is a Christmas tradition.  My 12-year-old niece and I watch it EVERY Christmas, much to the chagrin of our family members.  :-)

I laugh at several parts of it, as does my niece.  There are cute talking animals, a paint ball war, an ugly sweater contest, and so much more!  And, yes there is a lesson here about helping others and all that hokey jazz.

The worst part = the bad guys. The ""bad guys"" in this movie are so annoyingly stupid.  I  think it is meant to be funny.....but it is not.

Not a lot of depth here (if you want depth, I doubt you would pick this movie) but it is cute for an hour and a half during the Christmas season.",1483315200,,649,4.087301587301587

And not even in the sense that you would hope to get from Grumpy Cat. She just didn't sell the role. All of the other animals were wonderful and believable, but grumpy, the star of the show, was incredibly aweful. I can only deduce that all of the folks giving the movie 4 or 5 stars are hardcore lifetime fans. Seriously...I love grumpy cat and reeeallllyy wanted to love this film....but it was bad. And the only reason it was bad was because grumpy cats voice actress was horrid. The whole movie I spent thinking about how bad she really was and how she was really a human doing a poor job at her role. I was biased for it to be good and I can even tell you thathat it didn't sell.
Grumpy herself was adorable in this film so with only a dollar cost I don't regret it at all. But seriously...her voice actress should stay out of film. She didn't even sound like she was trying to be ""grumpy"" or ""bored"" or ""disinterested"" or etc....she was just BAD!!",1482537600,,1067,4.287128712871287

We had high expectations for its schlock value, but in the end, we were pleasantly surprised that it was so entertaining. Yes, the acting is really awful, the plot is cheesy, and the voice of Grumpy Cat didn't really seem to fit (too much expression, affect not flat enough)...but the production values were actually adequate, and way more of the jokes landed than we expected, especially when the film poked fun at its own shortcomings. In particular, it was worth watching just for the delightfully hammy performances delivered by the comic relief villains... a somewhat-less-violent, rock-n-roll version of the hapless Home Alone burglars. I imagine Grumpy Cat's 15 minutes of fame is running out (and her owners are smart to cash in while they can), but I think I could watch this one all by myself every year...

6679048,5,B00NT71BNQ,"If you love cats, especially sarcastic ones this might interest you. Grumpy Cat is actually quite a bit more adorable in this movie than in pictures online. This movie is also very funny not unlike a Home Alone with two bad guys and a 12 year old girl who saves the day. There is one scene in this movie that made me laugh until I cried. I guess if you get the humor you really get it. I would however not recommend this for kids. It has a few minor swear words in it and some scary situations. I'd only recommend this for adults who love cats. I feel guilty for loving this movie, but I did.

That's especially true of Lifetime Movie Network, which makes this enchanting film starring the world's most famous cat all the more remarkable. It has some of the goofy charm (and the cheesiness) of Disney's live action films from the 1970s (remember The Cat from Outer Space?) Megan Charpentier is adorable as the lonely girl who befriends Grumpy, and the rest of the cast sparkles--particularly Evan Todd and Isaac Haig as  the two brain-dead rockers and Daniel Roebuck as the blowhard mall cop. There's some delicious social satire, much of it aimed at LMN and the whole Grumpy Cat phenomenon. Gayla Peevey's chestnut ""I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas"" puts a  smile on your face and sets the tone for what follows.

But definitely a family friendly movie, great for everyone of all ages. Me, my mom (who is in her 70's), and my son (who's a teenager, yep.. I was surprised too) all love this movie.

6679149,4,B00NT71BNQ,"""Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever"" is a predictable Lifetime movie based around the supreme meme of the Internet, Grumpy Cat. The movie is a cute and wholly inoffensive Christmas film that kids in particular will love (the heroes are a 12-year old girl and a cat, after all). The production values are typical for a Lifetime movie, and the DVD comes with a few amusing extras. I have to admit I didn't find Aubrey Plaza's voice to be what I expected from Grumpy Cat, but she did a good job overall, particularly handling sarcasm. The plot of the film is of little consequence but involves Grumpy Cat's perpetual existence in a mall pet store, her psychic bond with Chrystal (Megan Charpentier), and Larry Blamire regular Daniel Roebuck as a corrupt mall security guard with an astonishing get rich quick scheme. There is plenty of physical comedy, mostly from the criminal element of the movie, and, of course, a heaping helping of yuletide feline snarkiness.

""Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever"" will win no awards, but it's enjoyable enough viewing to put your brain on hold with for an hour and a half.",1452211200,2,1106,4.790575916230367
6679150,3,B00NT71BNQ,"I thought I'd like this since I enjoy Aubrey Plaza's ability to pull off dry wit and I pretty much enjoy all internet cat celebrities including grumpy cat.  But, while I thought the movie was OK for someone exactly like me,  I think it is not meant for a wide audience.  To me the characters that were minorities played up to stereotypes too much.  It was at a level that bothered me and typically as a non-minority I'm not overly sensitive about stereotypes.  It was just so blatant in this movie.

Another issue I had was with my personal distaste for movies that play out and then amend things that happen earlier or keep playing the same scene differently aka. Ground Hog Day- which I hated.  If you don't mind a narrator that repeatedly goes back on the last few minutes of video and says that things didn't really happen that way then this feature of the movie won't bother you.

The last issue I had with the movie was that the dumb criminal characters were constantly making references to bands and musicians that are not currently mainstream.  There were classic rock references but there were also a lot of references to more modern and Indie musicians.  So much of these characters' dialogue was spent on these references I would expect that those who are not greatly into music will be bored during these scenes.  Unfortunately there were many of them.

I wanted to rate this a two because I didn't really like it but I gave it a three since I did get the cultural in-jokes and there were a few genuinely funny parts.  I don't miss my 99 cents on this but I would not pay much more.",1451952000,,1594,4.455172413793103
6679151,1,B00NT71BNQ,We suffered through half of this movie. I was excited as this is Grumpy Cat. The acting was terrible. The grumpy cat narrator was drull and sounded like she was reading off a piece of paper. The plot line could have merit but the acting killed that.

The voice takes a little getting used to (remember Garfield?), but it's a totally Grumpy movie :) The blatant gimmikry gets a little annoying (it is after all a TV movie, put on a DVD), but nothing a grumpy cat fan would not have already come to accept as normal. It's cute, if you are a cat person.

Of course, if you're a Dog Person, don't bother.",1423699200,,478,4.195652173913044

Its' adorable, (seriously, how can you not love Grumpy?), and it's filled with lighthearted laughs.  It is not going to win any awards, but for the 90 minutes span, I will be hypnotized by the cuteness.  The acting for a Lifetime movie is better than most, so that was a surprise for me.

This silly movie, written possibly by a plagiarist program on an old Radio Shack computer, is only for lovers of movies like Dumb and Dumber and Jerry Lewis.  I give it 5 stars for immaturity and internet cat exploitation.  Your under 5 year olds may just love it.  Another movie full of stuff you pray your kids will never do.

6679280,4,B00NT71BNQ,"Grumpy Cat (voiced by Abrey Plaza) and her co-star, Megan Charpentier, are terrific in this movie.  The self-deprecating humor re Grumpy Cat and Lifetime movies is hilarious, as is the shameless huckstering of Grumpy Cat gear.
I agree with critics who think that the secondary characters are rather lame.  But for me, Grumpy Cat and Charpentier make up for what the other characters (and their story-lines) lack.
The movie is supposed to be silly, and it is.  As one amazon reviewer put it, ""It's not Cecil B. DeMille,"" and of course it isn't meant to be.  It's more along the lines of Pee Wee's Big Adventure - a movie that's funny on the first viewing, and even funnier after a beer or two (or, in this case, an eggnog or two :)
The movie also provides positive messages for kids, such as loyalty, teamwork, rejecting mindless conformity, having compassion for animals, and being able to laugh at oneself.

The cat itself is more of a prop than an active player.  It's often more like a picture of a cat with voice added.  Still it is a cute story.

I honestly could not watch more than 30 minutes of this movie. The humor is for 7 year olds, I think I maybe cracked a half of a smile at least once. I know the cat may be a girl, but that voice just doesn't connect. There is so much more they could have done with grumpy cat. Instead, we get no Christmas magic, and no humor.

Though when the main character admits that it isn't then I can say it's at least more enjoyable and with Grumpy Cat this is since she's all about the unhappiness.  Though don't get your hopes up on quality saw this on Lifetime Channel and it wouldn't be in any collection unless your like really creepy though then again it's not as bad as any other said worst movies and maybe enjoyable if your brain was turned off at some times.

Her voice does not fit the cat's persona or looks at all, and there's not enough attitude. That's the first problem with this movie. The next problem is the storyline. Lifetime could have done so much more with the story instead of making it into a cheesy one-dimensional no-brainer with the dumbest villains on the planet. Grumpy Cat deserves better and the young girl who played the main character deserves better. There are many ways they could make this movie cute for kids while still adding enough humor for adults to enjoy it instead of the simple storyline that had no layers of counter-plot. There should be less of Grumpy making fun of her own commercial success and more moments of Grumpy in action (for example, like the scene where she was shooting the villains with a paint ball gun). Hopefully there will be another movie in the future where Grumpy's persona is better represented with a voice that is more fitting, a better plot, and better script writing.",1419292800,3,1180,4.623809523809523

I am fairly certain that Grumpy was not over-taxed or harmed, or even stressed much during the filming, although I really don't go in for using animals as actors in film - I'm certain, they would just rather be left alone and at home.

What was enjoyable was Grumpy's ironic/humorous commentary during the film and about the film. That was done extremely well, and worth the price of the ticket. I urge Grumpy's family to give her a chance to retire from public life and let her go back to being just a housecat...

6679479,2,B00NT71BNQ,"I HAD A LIFETIME MOVIE ONCE. IT WAS AWFUL by Katniss, Cat Reporter

There is only one reason to watch this movie and thats GrumpyCat herself. She has a face to launch a thousand sequels. Every time the camera is on her, you cant look away. Even though weve seen the Friskies music videos, somehow its still startling to see this meme come to life - to see that shes a real, live cat. (Except for when shes obviously switched with a plush cat, cat-double or when fake paws are used  all to this felines amusement). The filmmakers understand that she is the draw. Thats why, during the dull parts, they inserted cartoonified images of Grumpy as Cupid, Grumpys face in a Christmas tree ball, or Grumpy popping in up in any way possible to rescue us from boredom.

I consulted the younger Humans in my household because they are honest with their opinions and don't hold back. (For instance, they are not shy in telling someone that her head is too small for her big, fat, furry body.) Well, let me tell you that every time Grumpy was on screen, they were glued. If she opened her mouth into a meow, they would squeal in delight, pause the movie and replay Grumpys mouth opening, again and again. This is the power of Grumpys charisma. More than once, I heard them vocalize such things as, I want a Grumpy Cat stuffed animal for Christmas! And Is that a real (Grumpy Cat) hat/t-shirt/toy? I want it! These exclamations should not be underestimated  no matter how pawsitively weak the movie might be, make no doubt about it, this cat is about to sell a truckload of merchandise this holiday season. It must also be noted that any time the Worlds Most Famous Internet Cat was not on screen, the young Humans tended to lose interest or even walk out of the room. (Although not before being subjected to a truly hissworthy joke about child molestation.)

Aubrey Plaza does a respectable job of voicing Grumpy, though a more purrfect choice might have been Tracy Grandstaff, the voice of MTVs Daria, because her voice is a little lower and a tad more grumpy. Standouts are cameos by fellow Internet felines Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat and the spirited young actress Megan Charpentier playing the part of Chrystal (the name of Grumpys real-life young Human).

Its a shame that this celebricats first film is a big, jumbled mess of Grumpy product-pushing, boring subplots about baffoonish Home Alone criminals, a mamas boy mall-cop and love interests that are anything but interesting. But theres no denying that with this movie, a star has been born. Now she just needs to find a better starring vehicle. Not that she cares.",1417737600,8,2612,4.642857142857143

It's a typical Lifetime piece of holiday fluff, ladled with a heavy dollop of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and garnished with twitter hashtags.  It's like nothing you'll ever see.  Grumpy herself is not the attraction (although she is adorable).  It's Aubrey Plaza as the voice of Grumpy Cat that makes this otherwise semi-sweet holiday fable stand out from the pack.",1417478400,18,450,4.868421052631579

The story line is bland, it could've been a lot better, and Grumpy's voice was not what I expected.. Was not crazy about her voice. Also. I wasn't a fan of how the movie was narrated and the way it marketed itself if I wanted to see marketing, I would just watch a commercial.

6679492,3,B00NT71BNQ,The movie was okay at best.  For the most part the movie wasn't funny and was more boring than anything.  There were about 6-10 great scenes in the film but that's about 6-10 minutes out of 108 minute movie.  I am a fan of grumpy cat however i think she was better off as a meme with merchandise than a role with a terrible voice actress.  Honestly when you see grumpy cat online you don't want to hear the voice they used for the movie.

The plot had holes and left us face-palming as a result. The script was mundane and less than humorous compared with the marketing taglines of Grumpy past. This could have been done so much better, and even calls attention to that fact with its numerous self-put-downs pertaining to budgeting, in movie commercials for grumpy cat merchandise, and consistently breaking the 4th wall.

Every year, just like A Christmas Story, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, A Charlie Brown Christmas and Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer.  Aubrey Plaza's flat Parks & Recreation voice was perfect for smart and sarcastic Grumpy.  Grumpy breaking the 4th wall and speaking directly to the audience was consistently funny, as was Grumpy's vivid imagination.  One what-if moment (the pet store possibly closing with Grumpy thus becoming homeless) was dark humor, but hysterical.  The movie didn't mind making fun of itself, which added to the fun.  It was also sweet to watch Grumpy express empathy and become a friend to a lonely girl. Grumpy's one-liners had me laughing all the way through the movie.

If you're looking for a serious high brow movie, this isn't it.  If you want some laughs along with light messages (friendship, love, team work, compassion for animals, etc) watch this and be entertained.",1417305600,129,977,4.981481481481482

If Grumpy Cat just sat slouched over in his little sleigh for the entire movie, it would have been more captivating than this movie. This isn't watchable. This is pure torture. If I were Grumpy Cat, I'd be pizzed about the portrayal. BTW, Grumpy Cat with a female voice is about as wrong as it gets. This rates a minus one thousand.

6679499,3,B00NT71BNQ,"Face it, if you were expecting any genuine effort to go into a movie about Grumpy Cat, you need to get your head examined. This movie is a cliched, made-for-TV movie aimed at kids and made for marketing. What makes it so wonderful, though, is that the movie admits it. Grumpy Cat and other characters regularly break the forth wall, freely admitting the cheapness of their movie, laughing and snarking along with the audience, rather than trying to convince us to take it seriously. And of course it does; it's a Grumpy Cat movie, after all.

My only complaint would be that Grumpy Cat's voice took getting used to. I always imagined Grumpy Cat to have a low growly voice, envisioning her persona as some elderly crotch. This movie interpreted her as a world-weary teenager. But it wound up working alright. In any case, Grumpy was ADORABLE. Every time Crystal (why do I remember the girl's name?) picked up that cat, I had to squee.

Very entertaining for what it was. Though it's probably better watched while you're working on something, rather than being a ""sit down, lights off"" movie. If you have kids who like animals, they might enjoy it.",1417219200,8,1146,4.696517412935323
6679500,5,B00NT71BNQ,"This movie was funny and Grumpy was adorable, as expected.  I really enjoyed the humor and the way the movie poked fun at itself (the phenomenon of Grumpy Cat) and Lifetime movies in general.  I thought the acting was very good, especially by the actress that played Chrystal and the two actors playing the rock star dog thieves.  The voice of Grumpy, by Aubrey Plaza, grew on me after a few minutes.  Kind of monotone, but I think she made it work.  Grumpy (Tardar Sauce) is beautiful....just being her adorably grumpy self.

6679503,5,B00NT71BNQ,"""Dear"" Grumpy Cat,

So, I get it.  You want to be a star.  So do I.  After all, I was the first dog ever to hang out with Khloe Kardashian, and she gave me her highest endorsement.  And then even her sister Kim came along, nodded a bit, and behind the scenes thought that I was at least cute.

But I really don't understand how you got the first movie deal.  Why wasn't it me?  After all, I'm cute and cuddly, I'm friendly -- I even smile every once in a while, and I chase my tail even -- and the best you can do is frown.  Really?  REALLY?  You're just a big downer, in my opinion.  I know how to make people smile, and all you can do is make them cry.

So I saw your so-called ""movie"" tonight.  Big deal.  Yeah, you got Aubrey Plaza involved, probably before she knew what she was getting herself into.  I get the whole Paul-Blart-at-the-Mall thing, and I get the whole that-guy's-cute-so-he-might-be-the-next-Tom-Cruise thing.  But the rocker antagonist dudes?  Really?  REALLY?  Why did you have to bring Nirvana into this film too, and bring down Courtney Love at Christmastime too?  Hasn't she suffered enough?  It's been 20 years for her, her old wounds were just starting to heal, and now you had to open them up again?  Shame on you!

Well, I've got something that you'll never have:  love.  Yeah, Buddy loves me, and so does my ""human.""  And so do the Kardashians.  Sure, you've got that cute little girl with the curly hair and all, and sure, she's got some nice acting chops for her age.  But really, couldn't she afford jeans without holes in them for the film?  I guess Lifetime IS cheap, as you so ""cleverly"" mocked during your first and last movie.  But that little girl will eventually grow up, go to college, and forget about you.  And she'll forget about the time you and she were that great ""team"" at the mall.  But Buddy and me?  We'll be friends forever!

I'm going to get a movie deal too, just you wait and see.  And when I do, I won't ""wink"" at the cameras, saying stupid stuff like ""The Lifetime Movie Network doesn't want to kill off their star, because they need a sequel,"" and all that stupid stuff.  They won't have to.  I have real fans, fans like Khloe, and they just won't allow it.  SHE won't allow it.

Well, ""Merry Christmas,"" kinda.  Enjoy your fifteen minutes, sourpuss, 'cause that's all you're gonna get.  I'll have my 15 years; heck, I've been famous for at least five already.  And I can smile.

Best of Luck.  You'll need it.  ""Love,""

Boo

PS - OK.  I will admit, I really liked your movie.  But you got lucky.  But really, they should call you ""Apathetic Cat"" and not ""Grumpy Cat.""  'Cause that's what your acting was like.  And how I felt while watching, while doing something more interesting:  chasing my tail.",1416614400,2,2759,4.412
