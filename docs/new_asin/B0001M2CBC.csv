8324790,1,B0001M2CBC,This came yesterday and it does not work.  It keeps getting stuck.  It is defective. Very disappointing because I was really looking forward to watching especially segment on the Fatima pilgrimage.,1494460800,,197,5.32258064516129
8324791,3,B0001M2CBC,"A Great Idea but lacking in production with bad sound quality & a few video like flaws on a single DVD. Mostly a documentary of what happens during 2 main Pilgrimages of Croagh Patrick in Ireland & the Island of Iona in Scotland. What brings the review score down is the Grade B performance from an unnamed woman acting as a historical narrator in a library. In fact, I believe the words she uses are listed above in the Amazon.com description. It would be better for her just to speak during the documentary rather than act out like she is thinking about the words. Therefore as long as the DVD stays with the ""Real"" events it is worth watching. The 1st main Pilgrimage is of Ireland's western mountain Croagh Patrick where Saint Patrick stood the Pagan fasting test of 40 days & nights all within a modern Roman Catholic perspective. The other main Pilgrimage is on the Scottish Island of Iona where a famous monastery was built. This Pilgrimage gives more of an ecumenical outlook were the Eucharist celebration at the end comes close to a Jewish Sedar with its large loaf of bread (Challah or Holly) that is passed around with several large cups of wine. Many of the participates from both Pilgrimages reveal the reasons why they go on a Pilgrimage & what they learn or what questions they have learned to ask. Both of these Pilgrimages were originally Eastern Orthodox or Celtic Christian (before 1066 AD or William the Conqueror) but have taken on mostly Roman Catholic rites with a few Protestant overtones. Today some Eastern Orthodox Christians also make these Pilgrimages but there is no mention of this in the DVD. The Pilgrimages need more historcal background to raise the review rating. There is too much information on what the Pilgrimages are now rather than what they were throughout their history. There are about 10 other short western to near eastern European (Poland & Bosnia for example) Pilgrimages on the DVD extras section, yet most are from a Roman Catholic perspective. The DVD extras section set-up is rather un-logical & you may find yourself pushing the wrong button & entering the wrong preview. No inside information is included, just a bare DVD with its outside cover. The same Music seems to repeat throughout with a few other folk tunes added in here & there.",1233100800,2,2294,4.766331658291457
