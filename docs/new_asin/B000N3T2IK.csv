8174603,5,B000N3T2IK,"Considering the popularity of the DC5's song ""Catch Us If You Can"" versus ""Having a Wild Weekend"", I have no clue why this movie had to be ""re-titled"" for American audiences.  If you don't LIKE British stuff, you don't BUY British stuff, so the whole process seem inane.",1409788800,,270,4.625

8174605,4,B000N3T2IK,"This is the ONLY recorded document that is available showing the DC5 in speaking roles (except Len). I saw this film on TV in 1969, 4 years after it was out. I was heavily into music at that age(12)and had never heard of it due to the poor promotion and distribution in America. To see any band in a film those days was interesting to me, especially after having seen both Beatle films, but at that age, I was mystified at the adventure portayed in the plot. It was more realistic and relatable than being chased by screaming fans revolving around a TV appearance or running from Indian thugs after a sacred ring. As exciting as those plots were, because this one was so different and featured the DC5, as a band or not, left an impression on me (almost a teenager and seeing this free wheeling life style)and re-discovering this movie again brings back near that same feeling at age 54 (having done most of the free wheeling by now!!) It is SO great to see a young and alive Mike Smith and Dennis Payton, this alone is worth it! The film does not mimick A Hard Day's Night, the guys do not play musician roles (they are stuntment), and the DC5 music featured is not shown being played by them. But we ALL know that it IS them and you have to take that for what it is worth. There are Monkee and Beatle like parts in the film (even though the Monkees had not yet happened when the film was made, but had by the time I saw it), such as the opening theme(Mike Smith jumping on a trampoline looks like a Peter Tork scene),the first scene where they are preparing for their day, the Friday night party scene, a scene in the middle where they get the call from Dave (named Steve in the film) to come and get him in Bath, and near the end where they are trying to rendezvous at a remote farm while being chased by Police and the Ad agency goons in a really neat jeep type vehicle. Director John Boorman's first film (chosen by Clarke)has great production for this era. The ending scenes where the rest of the group are standing on the beach, still in costume from the previous night's party, watching Steve and Dinah take a short sea tractor ride to the island that was their destination during the whole film, is a still frame to behold!! This movie is a time piece for sure! The only down sides I can think of is the sometimes quick dialogue with heavy British accents and slang sometimes is hard to understand. There are parts that I've played over and over and still cannot make out the exact words, but you get the drift. The soundtrack is a bit on the tinny side, it is only 2 channel mono, but has a hard top end to it, even through the TV speakers. Lastly, make sure your DVD player accepts all region formats. This is a PAL region 2 DVD. It will not play in standard USA DVD players. I LOVE my all region Pioneer!! Almost forgot to mention the COOL Jaguar E-Type convertible featured in the beginning where Steve(Dave)and Dinah(a young and very cute Barbara Ferris) take off from the commercial shoot in!! Can you guess that I LOVE this movie again!!! Re-discover the DC5 again, almost forgotten among the many other bands of the era. Their material is scarce (never understood why but Clark holds all control over any output), so grab this while you can. Their music is great and the soundtrack has some great incidental music also. There is a great Surf/Jazz piece when they first take off in the Jag that is incredible!! Just get this movie!!! It will play on any PC DVD drive by the way.....",1343088000,12,3498,4.374807987711214
8174606,1,B000N3T2IK,"Be very careful about the dvd of this that has the mostly orangish cover with the square segmentation that's listed as a region 1 dvd...with hardly no other information. As far as I've been able to find out, this film has NOT been issued on dvd in North America yet, making this a bootleg. And that could mean that, for close to a $40 price tag for this, you'll wind up with a dvd copy from a VHS tape.  Forewarned is forearmed.",1338508800,11,428,4.219512195121951
8174607,2,B000N3T2IK,"This film is frustrating bordering on madness.  It has the makings of being a very good film if not for the elephant in the room namely Dave Clark.  In a nutshell he can't act.  He goes through the film with a glum look and a straight ahead stare.  He may think this may be acting but it's more akin to a frightened deer trapped in the headlights.  There's a pall hanging over every scene he's in and he's in virtually every scene.  The other members of the Dave Clark Five, who are barely in the film, seem more engaged than their de facto leader.  I can imagine the rewrites and the maneuvering of first time director John Boorman did to compensate for his star's deficiencies.  All is not lost, however.  Clark's co-star, Barbara Ferris as Dinah the ""Meat For Go"" girl has a fragile beauty and agreeable personality that is refreshing.  The songs are pretty good though they're not performed but serve as background noise because Clark and his mates play stuntmen not musicians.  In the words of Jon Lovitz's Master Thespian, ""Acting!"".  If anything this film would make the case for the quintet to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Regardless this film goes to show that not only musically but cinematically the DC5 were light years behind the Fab Four.",1332460800,7,1273,4.579646017699115
