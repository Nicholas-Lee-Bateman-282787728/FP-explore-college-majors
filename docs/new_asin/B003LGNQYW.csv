8516482,5,B003LGNQYW,"Masterful exposition of Joyce's magnum opus by Prof. Heffernan.
  Great job of synthesizing storyline, paralleling of Iliad chapters,and at same time, explaining Dublin mores and expressions. Turned a too often opaque mlange of language, Greek myth, and uniquely Irish sayings into a well- structured  English lesson. Heffernan even manfully attempted to ape the accents of the various characters and act out many scenes.
  It is a shame that the nature of the teaching profession in this country does not proffer performance incentives for superior achievement. This video ought to be required viewing for students assigned the otherwise unenviable task of plowing through the dense thicket of Joyce;s prose.
