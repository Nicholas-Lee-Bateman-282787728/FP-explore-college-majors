It does however feel like the writers goal was season 5 but they took too long building up to it and ran out of time causing season 5 to feel a bit like a different series than seasons 1-4.",1454284800,,232,3.9574468085106385

8426483,5,B004E54JMC,"This is last part of the Earth series. I really loved it. I have liked all of Gene Roddenberry's series. In my opinion, I think is one of the Alien series best writer and producer. I have purchased four of his series. I only need two more. I can watch again and again. If you like Aliens, you should like this one.",1403308800,,314,4.080645161290323

8426485,4,B004E54JMC,"It's to bad the other reviewer was sent damaged disks.  The ones I have were fine. Now on the the movie review.  When EFC was on TV folks had to wait a week and sometimes months before the next episode.  This allowed the writers to sometimes contradict story lines from one season to another.  When watching the episodes one after the other it is noticeable.  Also they sometime reused actors. The show easily could have ended in season 4 but did not. Season five is almost a spinoff to a new show. I understand money was an issue.  Seasons 1 = 3 were the best. A lot of reviews were disappointed with 5, but I recommend if you invested 4 seasons of viewing go ahead and finish the series.

There is only one character who was there in episode 1 and almost all the other episodes and was there at the end in the last episode.  can you guess who?",1351987200,2,845,4.2375
