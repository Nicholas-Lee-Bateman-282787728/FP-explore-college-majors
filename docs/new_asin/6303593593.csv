694752,5,6303593593,"The Soviet film industry produced some masterpieces after Khrushchev denounced Stalin in 1956, and The Cranes Are Flying is one of the most fully realized and emotionally moving films of the period.

The war separates two young lovers--they are forced apart without a chance even to say goodbye--and although we know that the young man, Boris,  has been killed early on, Veronika maintains hope to the very end despite enduring tremendous hardships.

The final scene, where she is forced to realize that Boris is never coming back, is in one sense heartbreaking but also strangely uplifting when we see what she does with the flowers she had bought to welcome him home. It is only the last of many sequences beautifully photographed in black and white.

Knowing a fair amount about Russian history, I couldn't help noticing that this was a Soviet film about World War II in which the dominant public figure of the period, Joseph Stalin, was never mentioned or alluded to.",1115424000,4,971,4.902439024390244
694753,3,6303593593,"I'll begin this review with the caveat that I'm not a fan of old movies.  This was the first old Russian movie I've seen.

Made immediately post-Stalinist times, the film has some beautifully conveyed scenes.  It is realistic in its portrayal of war as a harsh and deadly activity, refusing to give in to glorification.

But the film failed to captivate me, mainly because the characters lacked a depth that allowed me to be caught up in their lives and stories.  They seemed two-dimensional, like paper cutouts.  Viewers are given only a brief look at Veronica and Boris and their relations before the war.  The rest of the film emphasizes what happened to them and their relationship after the war began.  The lack of initial character depth at the beginning made it difficult to feel strongly for them later in the film.

Interesting as an example of 1950s Soviet filmmaking, but this is not the best film to see for a captivating story.",1090972800,9,940,4.717791411042945
694754,5,6303593593,"This is one of my favorite movies. It's quality is typical of what I have come to expect of a Criterion reconstruction. Something along the lines of HDTV black and white. It's that good. The story itself is situated at the begining of Russia's Great Patriotic War (WWII). The story covers every inch of human behaviour including happiness, love, sorrow, deceit, manipulation, and heroism against all odds. The last quarter of the movie is a stunning surprise, as it builds to an ending scene  that is nothing less than a grand tribute to the best of what makes us human. Even hardcore war movie fans (like me) can expect blurred vision at the end of this film. Not sappy at all, this film will strike a chord with viewers of any country, and most generations. It is not a single view disk.
I don't even know if it has an English language soundtrack, as the tonality of the Russian soundtrack combined with the very well produced English subtitles offers a great connection to the film even for non Russian speaking people. Buy this disk, you wil enjoy it over and over.",1043020800,78,1069,4.596858638743456
694755,5,6303593593,"This is one of those few Russian films that truly has to be seen to be believed.  Words simply do not do it justice.  The story is simple enough.  Boris and Veronika are in love with each other but when war breaks Boris volunteers for the fighting, leaving her to the care of his deceitful cousin.  Now, the film itself was made during the 'Soviet Thaw' when film makers were given a bit more freedom with which to work, and it shows in the realism of The Cranes are Flying.  There is no glorification of war here as it is shown for what it is, a brutal event that seperates loved ones and inevitably leads to death and sorrow for most.  There is very little, if any, political propaganda to sift through and the camerawork is absolutely next level.  Perhaps the only thing better than the cinematography in this movie are the performances.  In fact, it could be said that the only thing more beautiful than Tatyana Samoilova herself, is the performance she gives.  An incredible portrayal of a love that triumphs against all odds.",1037404800,24,1031,4.52972972972973

However, he also knows it would hurt Veronica's feelings if he left for the war.  Can he make a decision that could hurt his only love's heart?  Knowing that this film was filmed during the Soviet era when film was closely supervised and censored by the Soviet government, fed propaganda lines can be understood.

694757,5,6303593593,"I've never been a huge fan of soviet cinema until I saw this great movie a few months ago. Sure Eisenstein is a great director and he made wonderful classics but this is probably the first russian movie that I can identify with the characters since the Eisenstein movies and a few others that I've seen like Earth (Alexander Dovzhenko, 1930) are very political and showing me a culture and a way of life that is interesting and informative but that I can't identify with. This movie tells a simple story about a young couple (Veronika and Boris) that is separated because Boris as to go to war. I think I love this movie so much because it is so open and so full of humanity. It is also very poetic particulary when Boris is at the front and he dreams about his girl back home. But the thing that I admire the most is the superior cinematography, the camera angles are stunning and the close-ups (very close) are almost disturbing because you feel that you are spying on them or following them anywhere they go. Also, great scenes with hand held cameras and used wisely not just to use it but at chosen moments to accentuate dramatic scenes or to show chaos during this time of war. It amaze me that a great reference for  cinematography like that is not use or missuse in movies today. If you can, try to catch the movie I am Cuba with the same great director and the same wonderful cinematography, the story is political but unlike early russian movies of Eisenstein and such, the characters are warmer and you can identify with them.",1025654400,27,1536,4.4661921708185055
694758,4,6303593593,"Kalatozov captures a time of beauty in his retrospective look at the relationship between a war-bound young man and the woman left behind. The use of black and white, as well as the use of several hyper-reality dream sequences set a mood of uncertainty and hope. One especially poignant scene is when the young woman loses consciousness during an air raid, while Boris's cousin plays the piano, attempting to win her love. The window breaks and he carries her over the broken glass, a Russian symbol of broken promises.
The Cranes Are Flying (Mikhail Kalatozov, 1957) shows the agony and the waste of human life that was caused because of World War II, as seen through the eyes of a young woman home without her fianc, who had volunteered for the war, and was killed while fighting on the front lines. This film would not have been possible when Stalin was alive, for it shows the sadness and the anguish experienced by those left at home without loved ones. There was nothing heroic about Boris's death, as he was shot by a sniper and spent his last moments writhing in a bog. This cannot be seen as uplifting according to wartime Stalinist cinema, for it does not show the glory and the pride that every soldier is supposed to feel when fighting for Russia. It shows the truth, blatantly writing in draft dodgers, the realities of air raids, and the difficulty of keeping contact with loved ones. This was a breakthrough film, for it signals the rising awareness of the Soviet filmgoer, and his or her ability to handle a dose of the truth, even if it is in retrospective form. This acceptance of the truth is closely related to the increase in communist self-confidence. It is almost as if the Soviets realize that they are indeed Communist to the core, and do not need to justify it by eliminating all interior creativity or new ideas that may someday appear to threaten the socialist regime.",1014940800,13,1896,4.6626865671641795
694759,4,6303593593,"I'm pleased to see ""Letyat zhuravlii"" available in video, and with subtitles.  This is a classic Soviet film, set during the Patriotic War.  It begins with the cranes flying over Moscow, and for Veronika and Boris, the stolen evening hours are idyllic.  Suddenly their plans are shattered by War.  When Boris goes to the front, his fiancee cherishes his farewell gift and vows to await his return.  Meanwhile, Boris' cousin, Mark, who has bribed his way to a deferment, schemes to win her heart. War reaches Moscow, and Veronika's parents perish in an air raid.  She takes refuge with her fiance's family, loyally resisting the treacherous advances of Mark.  Anxiously she awaits letters from the front, which never come.  At last, under a barrage of bombing, Veronika is overwhelmed by grief and terror, and succumbs to the cousin's wiles.  At the same time, on the frontlines, alone, Boris succumbs to his wounds.  Veronika, unaware of Boris' death, weds Mark but remains haunted by guilt.  She flees her arrogant, abusive husband to serve as a nurse in a military hospital.  When War ends, she has convinced herself that Boris will return with the cranes to Moscow.  ""Cranes are Flying"" is a simple, tragic story, filmed artistically for its time, but without cinematic subtlety.  The geometric V-formation of the flying cranes, for instance, is repeated throughout the entire film.  The repetative imagery of marching feet, hurrying toward eachother but never meeting, symbolizes the futility of the protagonists' love.  The scene of Boris' death is melodramatically drawn out, his final dying thoughts only of his beloved.  I'm not sure of the filmmaker's intent here, but honestly, I feel only relief that the likable Boris is spared the hurt of Veronika's betrayal. Despite some cliche' and distraction, ""Cranes are Flying"" is a worthwhile film.  The final scene is powerful; the viewer will not be left dry-eyed.  Recommended for anyone who cares about the human tragedy of war.",998179200,39,1986,5.0928792569659445

Abound with gorgeous close-ups of leading lady Tatyana Samoylovas' face (where are these planes you refer to Mort?) and stunning cinematography throughout, this film tells the story of how a family and a fiancee in particular must deal with the tragedy of war.

But those shots were tied to sketchy, overlong, shrill vignettes, whereas this 1957 film is an enjoyable, old-fashioned melodrama. The lead, Tatyana Samojlova, is very appealing; she's fresh-faced and sexy and very moving when she needs to be. The most famous shot when she races to bid farewell to her lover headed off to war: it starts hand-held on a bus, leaves the bus to track laterally through a crowd, and then goes up, up, up on a crane to catch view the whole street.

""The Cranes are Flying"" (Russia, Mikhail Kalatozov, 1957) is quite simply one of the best films that I have seen in ages.

The story centres around two young lovers - Boris, an artist and factory worker (Aleksey Batalov) and Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) -- and the devastating effect that World War Two (Russia's ""Great Patriotic War"") has upon their relationship. It also highlights (being partially set in war-torn Moscow) the losses Russian people face during this catastrophic period.

At every moment in this film I was moved. From the opening scenes of romantic innocence (as the carefree lovers frolicked around the city streets) to the later scenes of despair and terror (the Nazi air-raids and burning rubble afterwards), the direction is perfect and constantly challenges your emotional resilience. This isn't like any fifties war film I have seen: it is more like watching a combination of French arthouse cinema and actual, gritty war footage. The lighting is stunning, the sets (including some spectacular outdoor and huge crowd scenes) are evocative, and the story binding it all together is touching. There are also several harrowing Hitchcock-style sequences (such as someone pounding the keys of a piano to drown out the roar of an air-raid) that the great man himself would surely have appreciated. At every level this surpassed my expectations, and I was left wondering why I'd never heard of this film before.

The central love-story is acted with great poignancy and passion by the two leads (particularly Samoilova, who portrays a mountain of restrained emotions for someone so young). It is through their initial romance (a memorable opening that is littered with lingering looks and touches, and ballet-like movements as they swirl adoringly around each other) that the later effects of war on those left behind are hammered home to chilling effect.

If you like a great war film, if you like foreign films, if you appreciate beautiful and character-driven cinema, then this will leave you mesmorised throughout and leave your appetite whetted for more Russian cinema. It is a simple yet powerful masterpiece that provokes all your emotions, and will sit in the pride of place amongst any collection.",1292630400,2,2237,5.185595567867036
694970,3,6303593593,"I have to say that I appreciate this film more than I really enjoyed it.  Film historians will find a lot to appreciate, too, more than I did.

I feel compelled to give my honest impression of the film, for those who may be interested in buying it.  What interested me, personally, was the glimpse inside Soviet society.  I found their clothing, their faces, their homes, their attitudes very interesting. This film was made at the height of the Cold War when Russians were still considered to be very much our enemies.  Here we see people who look a lot like us, and seem to have the same set of human passions and problems.  That may seem obvious to us, now, but as one who remembers keenly the anti-Russian attitudes of those days, I found this probably the most interesting aspect of the film

The story is very human, and shows the horrors and hardships of war, especially on those left behind.  It focuses on one young woman, Veronika, or ""Squirrel"" as her boyfriend, Boris calls her.
We see her before the war, when she and Boris are carefree and she dreams happilly of their wedding and life together.  Then the war breaks out and Boris volunteers.  From then on, Veronika suffers one loss after another and the carefree, rather capricious young girl quickly falls into shock and depression.

What I found most moving was the way the family of Boris took her in and cared for her, when she lost her parents.  Boris' father is marvellously played and for my money was the star of the film.  I also loved Boris' grandmother, the sweet old Babushka.

What probably kept me from really loving the film was the leading character, Veronika. I didn't find her to be a very sympathetic person. After pledging her undying love to Boris, she suddenly married his cousin, a concert pianist who was very much in love with her.  I could understand that she was frightened and needed protection but what didn't compute for me was the terrible way she treated him after the wedding, even telling him that she wished he had never been born.  Eventually she chased him into the arms of a loose woman and it was revealed that he had bribed his way out of military service. The film was clearly telling us that he was a bad guy. However he was consistently loving and kind to Veronika so I actually found myself more sympathetic to him than to her. I hate to say it but I didn't find the actress who played Veronika particularly interesting or attractive either.  (Spare me your nasty comments!)

There are some striking scenes.  My favorite was when the pianist played feverishly on his Steinway for Veronika during a bombing.  Another is the scene when Boris is shot and dies, clutching a birch tree as he goes down, with thoughts of an imaginary wedding with Veronika spinning in his mind.

I may be nitpicky to expect the plot to have more psychological reality but that's the way I saw it.  If you are a serious film student and/or love Russian culture then you will probably love this movie. Of course there are always those who are easily impressed by obscure foreign films, especially if they win the Palm d'Or.",1278806400,4,3108,4.582278481012659

What do I love about this movie? It is realistic. Life doesn't always go the way we think it should. It is also full of warmth and humanity. The characters are ones we sympathize with. And the movie is thought provoking. The imagery, scenery, and music in this film top it off to make it a true work of art.

This movie is safe for the family. Boris and Veronica's relationship is entirely pure. And there are no war scenes depicting violence or gore. Our five year old daughter watched it. Other than the English subtitles (the dialog is in Russian), she enjoyed it, too.

694973,5,6303593593,"I've always been, and probably (hopefully) will always be an emotional person.  Lately (in light of some major personal revelations) I've been an even bigger emotional wreck than usual, so it's no surprise that I bawled like a baby during the final `flower' scene in `Letyat Zhuravli'.  While the ending scene's manipulative sentiment may tug at every person's heartstrings (it better), the film as a whole is far from a clichd emotional melodrama.  `Letyat Zhuravli' is a tender, honest and beautifully tragic tribute to love, war and love during war.

The film centers around a young and impressionable woman named Veronika.  Smitten with her fianc (maybe not officially, but they cannot deny the inevitable) Boris, Veronika can't stop imagining the eternal love they will share as a family.  What she is unaware of though is that Boris has volunteered to fight in the war, a war that will tear her dreams to shreds.  With Boris missing in action and presumed dead Veronika feels almost forced into a marriage to Boris's draft-dodging cousin Mark, who has been pawning over Veronika even before Boris's departure.  Despite the cold shoulder by some in Boris's family, Veronika presses forward, holding firm to the belief that her love will eventually return to her.

But will he?

I want to just say right now that Tatyana Samojlova is a revelation here as the wilted Veronika.  Her handling of this lost soul is astounding.  She easily maneuvers her character through harrowing sequences of pure loneliness and isolation and then into enraged hysterics that never once feel forced or overtly dramatized.  She gives a natural and moving performance, breathing a life into this all too familiar woman.  I also want to single out Vasili Merkuryev, who plays Fyodor, Boris's father.  His strong and grounded paternal performance is a beautifully controlled example of unwavering love, even in the face of trials to once faith.  That final scene, the one that just kills me, is made all the more heartwarming (and breaking) by his presence.

This film carries with it a strong political statement, yet like powerful films such as `Dead Man Walking', `Scener ur ett Aktenskap' and `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile', `Letyat Zhuravli' refuses to gives us an easy answer to the questions posed.  War is a touchy subject, for there is rarely a middle ground.  You are either a supporter or not.  I personally (watch this get me a slew of negative votes) find the idea of war repulsive and do not support it in any way, shape or form.  That doesn't stop me from appreciating the stance that this beautiful film encourages us to take.  We see both sides of the spectrum and are left with the ability to either take a side or just ponder the ambiguities, which for me is the more richly rewarding course.  With strong talk of heroics (which is a needed attribute to completely adore the film) yet ample examples of the obvious downside, `Letyat Zhuravli' gives us an honest portrayal of war.

This film overcomes the subtitles and expresses the humanity that suffered so greatly during that so sad era when inhumanity seemed normal.

Lyrical and rhapsodic, this film benefits greatly from a director, cameraman and actors who don't shy away from the extravagant gesture, the romantic moment, or the juice inherent in melodrama.  Viewers will be swept away by a poignant love story and its operatic manner of telling, from a joyful, playful opening to the bittersweet conclusion.  The screenplay's also a fascinating mix of the romantic and cynical -- what a breath of fresh air this film must have seemed to audiences in its original release, with their memories of the suffering hidden behind the recent war's heroic facade.  This DVD transfer's exceptionally good, even for Criterion -- CRANES wears its age lightly here, the film looks new-minted.

The gorgeous, moon-faced Samojlova gives a touching performance as the beleaguered young war widow fighting against dispiriting circumstances, ably supported by a talented supporting cast. Kalatazov's mobile camerawork and swooping crane shots lend ""Cranes"" an exhilarating visual feel to match the hurtling passion of its ill-starred protagonists, introducing techniques he used again for his other masterwork, ""I Am Cuba."" Though it immerses us in despair, ""Cranes"" ends where it began, with a triumphant renewal of spirit.",1182988800,2,711,6.0495049504950495
695082,4,6303593593,"I had read somewhere that ""The Cranes are Flying"" was a rather over-rated Russian movie.  It had won the Cannes Palme d'Or or whatever they call their top award.  I have noticed that a number of the past such awards were for movies that I thought were over-rated (although, in fairness, many of the award winners were outstanding movies).  Thus I was prepared to be sceptical.  However, I was impressed when I saw it last night.  It is a very good (not quite ""great"") movie in my estimation.

It begins with scenes of two young lovers.  Their relationship seems destined yet not determined.  We are quickly introduced to the extended families and, before we know it, war breaks out.  I must admit that I wasn't sure just what war this 1960 movie was referring to.  Some of the architecture that we get glimpses of seems post-WWII.  While I don't think that there was ever any specific mention of the enemy, there were too many terms that made it clear this this was WWII (""fascists', ""Stalingrad"", ""Leningrad under siege"", etc).  Our young man, Boris, feels compelled to enlist, much to the dismay of his fiance.  His decision is quick and unquestioned.  One of the best series of scenes in the movie has to do with the lovers parting at the crowded train station.

Home life during the war becomes increasingly difficult and there arises a serious problem for the young lady.  At the Front, there is a chillingly beautiful scene in which a soldier is shot.  As he falls, we see, through his eyes, the tree tops spinning while his fondest dreams are brought to view amid those spinning trees.  The home front becomes even more challenging for our heroine.  In time she has to face up to choices that were forced upon her; choices that stain the dreams and asperations of her life with her beloved Boris.  We rediscover a code of ethics for the homefront in a series of impressive scenes.  At the end there is an outstanding scene depicting loneliness in a crowd; misery amidst celebration.  We are left with the realization that wars create victims in ways we don't always appreciate.  At the same time, the cranes remind us that life goes on.

I was tempted to put 5 ""stars"" on ""The Cranes are Flying"" but I started thinking of the many movies that have had a greater impact on me than this one.  Nonetheless, there are several scenes from ""The Cranes are Flying"" that will stay with me a long time.",1179360000,,2400,4.590588235294118

I was a young soldier, in 1969 South Vietnam, my girlfriend was married by the time I retuned, this very excellent film brought some of those memories back, memories that are met with a greater understanding that, although, life goes on for loved ones left behind, they are visited with hardships of another kind ... that ultimately, things work out the way they are suppose to more often than not.

Put another way: Until further notice-there is always a tomorrow.",1179273600,4,568,4.785714285714286
695084,5,6303593593,"Mikhail Kalatozov's THE CRANES ARE FLYING is a cinematic masterpiece.  The film was made during the height of the Cold War, but depicts World War II Russia.  Boris(Alexei Batalov) and Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) are the two star-crossed lovers who get caught in the whirlwind of war, and are separated when Boris volunteers to go to war to fight against fascism.

The plot becomes complicated when Veronica assumes that Boris is not coming back and marries his cousin.  She becomes the focal point of the film, and Kalatozov does a fine job at depicting her changing state of mind after her parents die during an air raid -- from carefree to madness.  One can see how Veronica has become disturbed by her actions, such as in the hospital ward where Boris' father, Byodor Ivanvich (Vasili Merkuriev), tries to calm an injured soldier who becomes upset upon finding out that his girlfriend married another man.

The cinematography is exceptional in capturing the dramatic scenes.  The images of World War II Russia are wrenching, but the images of the characters within the modernist infrastructures is artistically attractive to the eye.  Photographer Sergei Urusevsky simulates human chaos with his camera movements, which almost looks like a bird flying out control -- Veronica running side by side with a train amongst a snow covered landscape.  However, the most effective aspect about films, such as Cranes Are Flying is that it is shot in black and white and creates an abstract and ambiguous quality to the film as well as depict the emotions between the characters in their light and dark moods.

Overall, The Cranes Are Flying is a recommendable film.  For those not familiar with Russian cinema, this was quite a surprise.  The film captures the images of war and humanity, and brings an understanding of this particular period in Russian history that is not usually portrayed.",1173052800,2,1887,5.012820512820513
695085,5,6303593593,"It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness, and about hope. The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika, the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie. After separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the bomb ride, and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself, she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption, to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it, is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent.

For me, the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger, cold, and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books. ""Cranes are Flying"" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life - my background, my memory, and my past.",1171411200,9,2214,4.466666666666667

It would seem the multiple consequences left by the war 's wounds are so far to be expected. There are quite interweaved issues and events, that surmounts the frozen concept of the random. The trickery intersections of the fate become raw material for psychologist and hard investigators of the human nature.

This films talks us about the unsaid consequences of the War, even after having survived. In the War you may feed your dreams and hopes, but in the other side there is just a daily anxiety and desperation, and many times this living equation with both variables playing on different sides may clash, breaking the most sublime projects.

7851984,4,6303593593,"Director Mikhail Kalatozov's 'The Cranes are Flying', winner of the Palm d'Or at Cannes in 1958, seems to boast confidently, ""This is how you make a classic!"" It tells the story of two young lovers who are separated by the arrival of World War II. The film commemorates the lives that were lost in the Soviet Union during the war (between 22 and 30 million, more than in any other country). It observes patriotic self-sacrifice and heroism, but also builds a compelling anti-war message by illustrating the suffering and trauma that the Soviets had to endure during those years of human tragedy. Certain scenes even betray a hint of cynicism towards the government's official discourse. Apparently, this sort of nuance only became possible under the Communist regime after the death of Stalin in 1953.

The director operates in two different modes: one is a form of melodrama that feels a bit rigid and contrived; the other is a daring display of inspired, almost surrealistic flares in which the imagery takes off deliriously, as if suddenly propelled by a boost of adrenaline. This latter style is more lyrical and sets the film apart from the standard. Great photography by Sergei Urusevsky, who also worked with Kalatozov in the celebrated 'I am Cuba' (a piece of Communist propaganda that was very beautifully shot, but which I actually find overrated as a whole.)

'The Cranes are Flying' may have some flaws, but it's still quite impressive and relevant today. I can honestly say that I was shaken by it.",1445299200,,1511,4.8984375

7851990,5,6303593593,"While it does get melodramatic quite often, this is still an absolutely remarkable film. I also had a hard time picking which was more beautiful, Tatyana Samoylova or the camera work.

This is the fourth Kalatozov film I've now seen - 'Soy Cuba', 'Letter Never Sent', and 'Salt for Svanetia' the other three - so I was at least prepared for how incredible this movie was going to look but I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around what Kalatozov could do with a camera.

I mean nothing  in this film looks bad. Even the normal static shots with actors just talking to each other are beautiful to look at. Nothing Kalatozov did was boring. Ever. His camera was simply alive. Even the over-the-top scenes in the film (the bombing during the piano scene and the running scene near the train), for as insane as they are they actually work. Those two scenes are so absolutely out of control with creativity that it doesn't really matter that it's also outrageously melodramatic. Somehow through his camera Kalatozov actually turns melodrama into a strength to tell a deeper story. I can't think of a single artist in any other medium that pulls that off.

I'm beginning to think Mikhail Kalatozov was one of the greatest director who ever lived. He breaks every rule, he did things with a camera that even today, with equipment you can hold in your hand, nobody south of Alfonso Cuarn even dreams of doing. He was like a mad genius who somehow bypassed actors, sets, costumes, physical cameras, lights, and everything that goes into the production of a film and implanted the fevered visions in his head into a movie projector through some sort of forgotten magic. He wasn't a movie director, he was a conjurer.

More people need to see his films; he could reinvent cinema, 40 years after his death.",1405209600,4,1802,4.6719242902208205
