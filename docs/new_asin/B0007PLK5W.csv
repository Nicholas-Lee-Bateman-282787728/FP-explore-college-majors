2230594,5,B0007PLK5W,"This video is well worth getting.  I have the DVD version but I've seen the VHS and there is no benefit to getting the DVD.  Both are full-screen, and there are no extras on DVD.  Picture quality and indexing problems on the DVD suggest that the VHS version is better (until a new master appears on DVD).
Basically this doco contains the following:
1) a dramatisation of the real story of a cousin of the director -- the cousin (Pooh Bear) is a blood who is killed in payback for the killing of Cartoon, a member of a crip gang.  In turn Pooh Bear's little brother gets into some payback of his own when released from jail on a furlough to attend the funeral of Pooh Bear.  In general this part is good, and contains some underground hard-core g-funk in the funeral scene and there is some cool scenes with lowriders in those sections too.
2) An interview with KAM, a rapper who many probably know ('Neva Again', 'Made in America', 'Kamnesia'), and his homies Lay Back and Big Solo etc.  This part is good if you like KAM, if not it's relatively short.
3) Crips Roster.  Interviews with actual crips from LA.  Goes through several neighbourhoods.  Interviews here are very good, especially the one with Big Loc and Lil Loc of Grape Street.  Some cool lowriders here, the usual 63's etc but also some later chevys.
4) Bloods roster.  Interviews with actual bloods from LA.  Some great interviews here but you may need an interpreter, know what I'm sayin?  P-Funk every day.  No lowriders here, some nice red shoes though and for the ladies there are some pretty built homies here ;-)  EXTRA SPECIAL FEATURE: interviews with rappers Hi-C and 2nd II None.  Tha D looks like he may have been hitting the pipe at this time though -- sorry D!  Interviews cool though.
5) Biggie & Tupac.  Yes, there is a little bit at the end with Biggie and Tupac, where they bust a freestyle rap together over drinks.  If you like Biggie or Tupac this part is good, if not it's at the end of the tape, so ... Personally I would have preferred some more doco footage, or maybe an interview with DJ Quik!",1011398400,5,2081,4.457671957671957
2230595,3,B0007PLK5W,"this is an excellent DVD, especially the interview footage with the crips and bloods.  if you like lowrider chevvies the crips roster and the dramatic re-enactment sections have some sweet ones too, and some choice underground gangsta rap tracks.  KAM, Hi-C, and 2nd II None also appear in the interviews.
The only criticism I have is with the quality of the disc.  I have a Pioneer DV-344 and experienced some glitches in the second half (the bloods part) of the feature, with the visuals becoming pixellated and jamming up the first time I played it, but none since thankfully.  A friend had serious sound and visual problems in his Grundig player in the same part.  This would seem to indicate indexing problems with the master, and some players are obviously more sensitive than others.  If your player is more sensitive than some, think twice about this item.  Also there are no special features on this disc.
I'd give the feature itself 5 stars, but this DVD is little improved on the VHS (it's full screen, no special features) and may be troublesome on some players.  I would give the VHS 5 stars.",1007337600,,1105,4.71875
