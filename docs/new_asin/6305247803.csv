Nothing like ghost adventures, most haunted. you can tell they are honest and don't fabricate. if you want to watch real ghost hunters this is the place to be.",1516492800,,203,4.368421052631579
2867427,2,6305247803,"Mildly entertaining, in the way that sensationalistic, unjournalistic supernatural shows usually are. But the scariest thing about this 3-disc set is the video encoding quality. As with their poor treatments of NASA and space history material, the MPEG encoding looks worse than VHS. The blockiness and artifacts makes one wonder if Madacy Entertainment has the slightest idea how to do DVD.",992736000,10,391,5.426229508196721

8200839,1,6305247803,This is truly boring and amateurish. It's hard to understand why Amazon allows such garbage to exist on it's website.,1524268800,2,117,4.9
8200840,1,6305247803,"These really aren't ""ghost stories"". Some producer gathered episodes from different shows, including ""British Ghosts"", ""Paranormal Hunters"", and ""Oddity Files"" and pawned it off as a series of it's own. You will never see the title ""Ghost Stories"" on any episode. A few good moments but mostly  a mish-mash of ugghh!",1522281600,,316,5.196078431372549
8200841,3,6305247803,"This is a collection, not an actual series like Most Haunted or Ghost Adventures. It's a bunch of different crews, although a couple episodes might be the same group. They makes it difficult to review, for me at least, because each group has a different focal point. One is focused on the medium, one on the skeptic, one on the sensitive...  I enjoyed some of the episodes, and some I felt were a waste of time. Again, very tough to review.",1521936000,2,440,4.432098765432099
8200842,1,6305247803,"Total waste of time, clicked on link and it wouldn't let me even see this video, because of geographic location,  but looking at the reviews, looks like it was a load of rubbish anyways.  Not impressed with prime videos so far if this is what is gonna happen every time I wanna watch summat",1521504000,,290,4.351851851851852
