8151961,1,B000JLTSAS,"This film scrapes the bottom of the barrel so I won't spend much time here. The acting, plot, cinematography and dialogue are all horrible. Prolonging this agony was the fact that my copy was defective and I had to spend time making an exchange to obtain another, (lest I be stuck with a ""worthless"", unplayable disc). Funny, now that I have a copy which plays I still feel that it is worthless... How irritating, especially after I had planned to do something productive with my time like re-arranging my belly lint collection. But I digress! The only bright spots: 1) some of the gore is OK especially when one considers what these guys probably had to work with, and, 2) some of the scoring is actually effective (though most of it is not). Another downside is that the cover art is misleading as such is not portrayed in the movie. Maybe I'll keep my copy just for that. One has to love the tag line though, ""Friends don't let friends eat friends"". In retrospect, you don't see that occur in the film unless one buys into the ending which implied that the cannibals turned on one of their own. This character was so annoying that I was hoping that he would be killed first, but alas such was not to be. I was even deprived of the satisfaction of seeing his presumed gory demise as it was off screen and left to the imagination. But were they actually all friends in the first place? The mind boggles and you will not recover the lost grey matter if you watch this film. Strictly recommended for the ""completist"" who collects amateur splatter.",1235779200,,1546,4.525
8151962,5,B000JLTSAS,"My friend and I(we were around 13, 14yrs old) rented this gem and watched it after-school on a friday evening. The cover alone let's one know what type of film your going to watch. This is why I don't understand people who have seen the cover, watch the movie and then trash it as if they were expecting a horror classic like the excorcist or Halloween. Though for me this is a horror classic. It was the film that drew me into its gory grope hole. And as I emerged with a bloody grin my heart was content. This is a camp/gore/bloodbath/splatter film if you don't like this type of movie just don't watch it. Most are very low budget, hence their charm...God Bless and Happy Thanksgiving ! !",1195430400,11,691,4.364341085271318
8151963,1,B000JLTSAS,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has terrible lighting, very bad actors, and the whole story makes no sense. I have seen some bad movies, but this is one of the worst.",1189900800,,187,3.9473684210526314
8151964,4,B000JLTSAS,"When you think of John McBride, you really never think of a brilliant movie. You think of a fun, cheap shot on video movie experience. This movie for me is still and will always be his best effort.

For a shot on VHS movie you'd think everything would suck, from the gore to the acting and surely the directing. This movie seemed to have a lot going for it. The acting wasn't great, but it was pretty good. The killer were nicely contrived and acted, the blood and gore was phenominal for such a low budget production.

It's a fun, fun movie. Loved it.",1180915200,6,552,4.298076923076923
