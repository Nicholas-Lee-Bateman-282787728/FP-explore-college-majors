2770542,5,B000NJXG6S,"One of the best television shows in a while.  Newport Beach is a city of rich socialites and beautiful, spoiled people, where gossip is as good as the news and there's always more than meets the eye.  With the arrival of Ryan Atwood, a teenager from Chino whom Public Defender Sandy Cohen brings home and adopts, Newport is shaken, and Ryan must find a way to fit into his new environment and navigate the dangerous waters of Orange County.",1188172800,4,440,4.556962025316456
2770543,5,B000NJXG6S,"Much like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Dawson's Creek,"" ""The O.C."" is one of those series that is a true time capsule from the years of their broadcast.  The show was made for the generation of teens and young adults growing up in the beginning of the new millennium.  But unlike it's predecessors it wasn't aimed solely at teens, but at their older siblings and parents.  This is what set the series apart from the competition, and why it's first season was FOX's # 1 series.  Creator Josh Schwartz (almost fresh out of USC film school) created essentially a John Hughes-isq television show (if Molly Ringwald was 30lb thinner and had a no-limit Amex Card).  But the pop-culture quirks, loveable characters, and rich/beautiful sets was what made ""The OC"" the place to be.

The First season starts when Sandy Cohen (a Public Defender) brings his newest client, Ryan home for the weekend to his posh Newport Beach House.  After a series of random events Ryan is adopted by the Cohen's and the first season follows his fish-out-of-water experiences learning the ins-and-outs of Rich society, and all the secrets that come with it.  But events conspire outside of his control as he and his new brother, Seth, shake up the popularity Hierarchy at their High School.

The Second season takes the storylines and remaining characters from the first season and basically continues' their story's but with adding a lot more drama, subtracting some of the humor, and bringing 4 new characters into the mix.

Season three is where the show lost its direction.  Having lost almost 40% of its main characters, and completely abandoning the comedy in favor of almost unrealistic soapy drama a dry spill hit `The OC' from which the show never truly recovered with the ratings and the critics.  But if the third season did anything it show's the gangs graduation from high school (IMO in the best Graduation Scene ever to be filmed) and the death of a major characters that allowed the producers to complete re-tool the series in season 4.

Season four was more or less a renaissance for the series.  The creator returned to the show full-time (after a year hiatus) and the intense drama was dropped pretty early in the season in favor of some much need comedy that returned the show its quirky roots.  But unfortunately this wasn't enough and the show was cancelled; although the producers were given enough warning to write a finale that successfully and very-welly wraps everything up!

This DVD collection includes all 92 episodes on 28 discs.  All special features from the previous releases have been carried over including two-discs of `bonus content' and the first season is remastered in Widescreen for the first time!",1186790400,83,2709,4.892778993435448

It was put together with a very cheap plastic case & the very first disc I grabbed (Disc 1 Season 1) was cracked.... so I was instantly upset. I went even further & looked at the season 2 pack, opened it up & there a random ""extra"" disc falls out. This disc was a double of the bonus section & had not place ""just a floater"".

2770585,5,B000NJXG6S,"my favorite tv show of all time, I have seen I so many times I lost count, each time I finish season 4 I start back at season 1 episode one all over again, I was a senior in high school when this show came out and could relate to a lot of the issues ryan faced, this show touched a lot of hearts while it was out and is still so popular to this day, no better place than California and what an amazing soundtrack indie music at its best
no matter how many times I watch it, season 4 episode 16 the final episode always makes me break down a couple of tears
still don't know why fox canceled it im sure if hulu or Netflix was popular back then they would of picked it up, I still have faith someday they will rebot the show and ryayan and taylor living back in Newport with a child they take in to help, and summer and seth near by as well as sandy and Kirsten to check up on them, the oc is forever the best show, welcome to the oc b****",1453852800,,937,3.860103626943005

2770589,5,B000NJXG6S,"Adopted in a Jewish family , Ryan hopes cheerfully to integrate his new environment. But gradually the personality of Seth and the insolent haughtiness of the father are becoming increasingly difficult to bear.

The decisive meeting with a real man, his brother, put him in front of real personal identity problems. Can he still continue to attend these two degenerate beings without losing himself?

The disappearance of his girlfriend at the end of Season 3 intelligently signs the final outcome of the story: the usually cowardly personality of Ryan, his repeated efforts to please his adoptive family in spite of real personal misgivings and finally his inability to make up his mind; all these elements lead inevitably the person he really loves to embrace a tragic fate .",1448668800,,777,5.0625

I haven't watched the DVDs yet so I can't say if the quality is good (will update once I watch it). I'm also disappointed because it wasn't protected well in packaging at all.

The complete series went on sale and was advertised as being widescreen and 28 discs. I checked the wbshop site and it indicated 28 discs and that the first season was the remastered widescreen edition so I ordered this from amazon. If you look at the picture of the back of the box it indicates 26 discs. I was not concerned whether it was 26 or 28 discs, just that season one was widescreen as indicated in the product description.

When I received it I was disappointed that this is just a repackage of the four seasons that were released in the plastic cases and season one was not widescreen but was in fact the standard full screen version.

Amazon was great about taking the item back but if you were hoping that season one is widescreen keep looking. If you don't mind that season one is the standard full screen version then pick it up.

2770642,5,B000NJXG6S,"This is a must have collector item fir a fan of the OC, or for someone who would like to get into watching something new they never heard of before. It came in a clear thick hard plastic case. The dvd's are in a very sturdy material book like that slides out. It has very pretty vibrant photos of the cast all the way through that follows the episodes. The disc's have pictures on them of certain cast members and has easy to read numbering on the disc and the book which holds each disc in it's own slot, that when you remove the disc is has a very big easy to read numver of that disc. The show is very exciting to watch to see what new drama would unfold in each episode. You can easily lose track of time watching this thrilling series. For $58.00 its a steal. You couldn't find a better price or quality set of the OC.",1396569600,,823,4.08641975308642

2770645,5,B000NJXG6S,"This is a beautiful (and hearty) collection. The book is very large. If you have limited space, you may want to buy each season individually. The book comes with a clear hard plastic case. My only issue is that the DVDs have a tendency to fall out of the sleeves in the book. Overall, I love this collection!",1392422400,,308,4.327586206896552

It tells a story of an outsider for a rough part of town being brought into a world of wealth and exuberance, and into the lives of some of the better known tv actors of the time. Really great show if you like teen dramas.",1389916800,,319,4.079365079365079

2770650,1,B000NJXG6S,I purchased this item new from Amazon. Once I got it and opened it up I noticed it had some wear and tear to it. When I flipped the pages Disc 8-20 were not the right discs. Someone had taken out the discs from this box set and replaced them with the individually released season discs. Numbering was off and the pages inside were re-arranged. I called for a replacement. We will see what happens.,1388880000,3,397,4.306666666666667
2770651,2,B000NJXG6S,"I like the show, but this box set has several disks that do not work properly. I would say there were around 8 disks that had issues, and 10-12 episodes that I had to skip several scenes to get it to a point where I could watch it. It might be better to purchase them individually. I did like the packaging that came with it, but that's definitely not worth a bunch of episodes not working. Luckily Amazon is pretty reasonable with their returns, and a few weeks after purchasing it they allowed for a full refund with return shipping paid.",1388707200,3,540,4.356435643564357

2770653,1,B000NJXG6S,"This is not the REAL ""Complete"" Series.  Mine came with discs from previously released seasons intermixed with the actual versions. Just because you have the complete set of discs doesn't mean you should market them as such if you're simply filling the gaps with your own seasons... very disappointing.",1388102400,,302,5.163265306122449

It contains the entire series and comes in a gorgeous package to boot. The set is bigger than I expected with two DVDs contained side-by-side on each DVD holder page. Also included are many colorful cast pictures and notes about the series and episodes. A great send off to a great series. Highly recommend.,1387584000,,438,4.289156626506024

2770657,2,B000NJXG6S,"I bought this thinking that it was new; however what I received clearly looked like it has been used previously. There is a lot of wear on the seems where you open it, and the front of the box set has several cuts and scratches, which is odd considering they sent it in a protective casing.. The CDs have been working from the ones I have watched; however some of the CDs are not as shown in the preview picture. In the preview, it clearly looks like every disk has a number on the front, they all look the same except the CDs are different colors for each season. The CDs that I got look like they came from the individual box sets. The first season looks right, however season 2-4 look like the CDs from the box sets, except for the last ones in the 3rd and 4th seasons. Being a huge O.C. fan, I was very unhappy with my purchase.",1386892800,,832,4.1419753086419755

2770666,5,B000NJXG6S,"I loved the OC so naturally I had to get the set. This set includes the entire series, but it is not the big bulky book that is more detailed and extravagant (although the book is nice! My friend has it.) This set is also more affordable. My only issue with this package is that the amazon carton box it came in was not securely sealed. It was falling apart by the time I received it. I'm surprised the DVDs inside were ok.

2770669,4,B000NJXG6S,"The OC has a great combination of comedy and melodrama that can be appreciated by fans of soaps and fans of TV in general. There are great indie bands and more mainstream artists used in the plethora of songs for this series. At the price it's listed it is about a dollar an episode, which is a great deal for a show of this quality. However, for all of the cleverness, there are some down points, like the latter part of season 3. Overall, this is a great series that's a bargain for the price, with only a small number of bad episodes.",1362528000,,537,4.223300970873787

Pros:
- Plenty of extra features when the episodes run out and you need a little more.
- Great quality materials inside with awesome presentation
- We got it on sale so you really couldn't beat the overall value.

2770675,5,B000NJXG6S,"I have watched all 4 seasons of the great drama series on television is The O.C. with bonus features on this DVD set is great. Season 1 of the show was aired on Fox from 2003 to 2004, the year after Ohio State won the 2003 Fiesta Bowl in double overtime against Miami (FL) and LSU defeated Oklahoma in the 2004 Sugar Bowl and Season 2 was aired from 2004-2005, the same year when BCS controvesy on why Auburn (13-0), who are unbeaten didn't play for the 2005 Orange Bowl instead 2005 Sugar Bowl against Virginia Tech.

It has all 4 seasons of the OC presented in 16:9.
Great book type boxset with thick cardboard pages where the discs are stored.
Between each season is a group of thin pages with photos from the season and a list of episodes.
The only issue is it is quite long so won't sit nicely in a shelf, but I have it facing forward on display so it doesn't really matter.
The cover is actually a hologram type so looks like the water is moving,
Must have for any OC fan.",1357776000,,590,3.925

2770683,5,B000NJXG6S,"The only downside is that its too big for your standard dvd collection. Its like a book/dvd case. Just like a book, it starts with an introduction from the creator and a list of the main cast, lots of artwork/pics from the show, along with a description for each episode including the writer, director, and original airdate. Comes with a hard plastic case to protect from dust and slots within the pages where the 28 discs are in. All the features from the individual dvd sets are included in this set. Definitely a MUST for fans.",1354147200,,530,4.53125
2770684,5,B000NJXG6S,"I started watching this show when it debuted and I was a freshman in college. We would always invite the girls from our floor to watch it with us. The scenery and stories about ""life"" in California were a great escape for a bunch of Ohio people. As the seasons grew on and more friends were made, our OC parties started to get larger (and less about the show and more about the beer). If you're looking for a great way to escape the cold wintery weather and into some light-hearted teenage drama, this is definitely the show your looking for.

The product itself is fantactic! A hard acrylic case protects the DVD's and the full color, fully descriptive book they come in. My only fault is that I can't find the show in friggin' Blu-ray!",1354147200,,737,4.419117647058823

2770686,5,B000NJXG6S,"I purchased this box set two years ago and it remains one of my favourite TV show box sets for sheet ingenuity of design.
Yes, my first 2 boxsets came shattered. The acrylic housing just couldn't take coming all the way from the states to England but Amazon were very good at replacing it for me. On the third delivery, the box was fine and I was extremely pleased!
The lenticular cover is lovely, thoughtful, understated, relevant to the show and telling of the feel of it.
The book is great, (my main gripe is that opening it has worn away the print of the fold between the cover and spine) and has an exclusive interview with Josh Schwartz, lots of photos of the cast and the episodes (perfect for a show like this) and episode descriptions. The disc print has been redone, numbering them all, but retaining the colour coding of the individual sets. I am pleased that the complete Atomic County episodes were included, as this was the main reason I bought this set. These short webisodes were a sort of spinoff from the main show, but fans will get a real kick out of it.
When so many boxsets today suffer from a lack of design and feel cheap, this OC set feels every ounce as opulant as the world it features.",1351987200,,1213,4.395555555555555
2770687,3,B000NJXG6S,"Great product, Great buy, though when I bought the complete season in this collectors edition ""style"" package I did not expect for it to come broken. It was either bad packaging or mishandling through shipment but when I recieved it the clear plastic cover it came with was completely shattered.

Also, The box set of DVD's were new itself but for some reason it felt as it could have been in better condition as I was said to have purchased ""new"". All - in - all, great deal, great series, brought alot of good memories back to me and the episodes look GREAT on an HD widescreen. Though, I was a bit dissapointed with the broken plastic cover but I encourage any OC fan to purchase this at an awsome price!",1347494400,,707,4.396946564885496
2770688,3,B000NJXG6S,"The packaging for this product is TERRIBLE. Whoever designed it, did not take into account the banging it gets during shipping. The disks are slipped into a slot on a piece of cardboard (think a children's book, with slots in the pages) which do not hold the disks well enough to stop them from moving around during shipping. If you order this product, be sure to open and inspect it IMMEDIATELY. Five disks in my set had slipped out and were scratched to the point of not being playable and had to call for a replacement.

And just to note, there's nothing Amazon can do about it. The fault is all in the manufacturer's packaging.",1345939200,,631,4.48695652173913

2770691,5,B000NJXG6S,"I'll be short and sweet... This is one of the best television series ever in terms of characterization, world building, and rampant teenage appeal. The soundtrack is flawless. It has one of the best pilots and one of the best finales ever (a rare combo). The only drawback is that Amazon must ship it via donkey through desert and canyon because all the discs were jostled, some scratched, and the plexiglass cracked. Alas, I shan't be a dick and review The O.C. Poorly when it's Amazon that deserves the bad review. Reviews dissing the packaging are by idiots, it's beautiful packaging. Stellar show.",1341446400,,601,4.844660194174757

Every disc so far has had at least one episode that it skipped almost the whole way through. I take the disc out to see if it has scratches or needs to be cleaned but I see nothing. I still clean the discs and yet they still skip. I absolutely love this series but am so disappointed with these discs.,1340150400,,447,3.869565217391304

Awesome show, tons and tons of awesome extras, including the Atomic County series based on Seths comic. I have owned all 4 season on separate DVD sets, which I traded in years ago. This complete series has a few behind the scenes looks and extras those separate DVD sets didn't have. Still my favorite show I always kicked myself for trading it in, but I been checking on this item for a while now, and had a decent price drop from what it used to be, and purchased this item, as it has been my favorite show, at least until the creator, co-created Chuck which just may have beat the OC for my favorite. I only fear that this big DVD book will not age well over time.",1330128000,,792,4.217105263157895

She was so excited and happy. She made me watch some of the episodes with her and the show isn't half bad. More of a chick show but still pretty good. Packaging was great, Arrived on time and the Details in the book are really nice. A lot of detail went into it. Its not just a bunch of dvd's in a box. its a well designed, well put together Collection. Didn't like the cardboard slots that held onto the cd's but o well, its good enough.

The only thing I would say about it is that the way the discs are placed into the book is they fall out and can easily scratch. You have to be extra careful so that you don't scratch them but I am so this set was perfect for me,1323216000,,384,3.753086419753086

Having said this, I still LOVED this show.  While the first few episodes left a lot to be desired, if you can get past these, you will come to find a show with incredible character development, wonderful acting, terrific story arcs and more...

Now usually these seasons cost around $30 (yes, even 3-7 years later). So me getting all 4 of them used for $55 was a steal. I saved over half off of retail.

I just got hooked on The OC about a month ago, I know I'm a little late to the party...but I'm near finished with season 1 and already so much has happened, I can't wait to see what the rest of the series has in store for me!

The only complaint I have about the actual description is that it says it is widescreen, but when I popped in disc 5 (as that's what episode I was already on when I received my order), I noticed that it wasn't in widescreen...but in fact in regular 4:3 aspect ratio. I'm not sure if this is because I bought them used from a different seller than who I would have got it from if I ordered the same set as ""new"".

Other than that I have no complaints, and am extremely pleased with my order...especially the fact that none of the discs have scratches on them and the disc case and slipcover have no damage to them.

2770734,5,B000NJXG6S,"The Show: 5/5

Since it first came on in August of 2003 I was hooked. I mean HOOKED. I watched the original broadcasts of the ""summer season""--AND the weekend re-runs of the episodes that just aired a few day before. AND I taped them and watched them a 3rd or 4th time. It's almost like when you drive home tired, then can barely remember driving home--you just know you're there, and you're happy. Now, I didn't sleep through a minute of this show, but it does give me the feeling that it just flew by.

By the end of the season, I didn't know how the creative team ended up where they did, but I was satisfied with the results. Then season 2 came, and, despite some minor lulls, I was satisfied by the end. Except for Ryan's hair, which still bothers me... Then season 3 came, with more lulls... And season 4 came, completely rejuvenating the series with Taylor, a revamped (and increasingly likeable) ""mini Cooper"", and a lot more fun compared to other seasons--more fun than most shows on at the time, really.

The DVD set: 5/5

As you can see from my pictures (I put up a lot on the product page here) the book is very well put together, and it really does hold up well. At least, it does if you handle your DVDs with care. You don't have to hold it like a live  nuke, but handle it as you would with any TV on DVD.

The case is sturdy, as are the pages. A lot of people have complained about the cardboard slots, but I haven't had any problems with any sets that use this type of slot (Futurama movies, Simpsons sesaon 11, Alias complete series, etc). I suppose they could damage the discs, but you just have to be a little more careful. (And if you're really that worried about discs being scratched, you could buy something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Discgear-Selector-80-Disc-Value-Disc-Storage-System-Black/dp/B0015AB3GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Discgear Selector 80-Disc Value Disc Storage System - Black</a>&nbsp;to store the discs in a safer way. The set would probably be smaller if they used a design similar to the Buffy and Angel complete series sets. If that were the case, we wouldn't have such a nice looking display piece, with all the nice (and BIG) promo pictures that are used within the pages.

Most of what I want to say next is pretty much covered in the pictures that I've posted here; so for the rest of my review, check out the pictures.

To upgrade, or not?

In my opinion--go for it. Then again, if you don't have any season yet (chances are, if you were a fan when it was originally on, you have them already) this is a no-brainer. Back to the point. If you have some or all of the individual seasons, this set is well worth it. Especially if you have a 16:9 TV. Season 1 looks great on a nice wide HDTV. For me, that's the main reason to get this set. The bonus discs are nice, and if you're a big-time collector of TV on DVD (like me) and you like to show off your collection (like me), this is a definite eye-grabber of a box set.",1219795200,3,3025,4.556169429097606
2770735,5,B000NJXG6S,"Don't be misled.  This is not just a teen drama.

2770738,5,B000NJXG6S,"I was tempted to buy the DVD season sets individually to save money. Thank God I decided to get this instead! Here's the breakdown:

PROS:

1) The actual book's packaging is simply amazing to look at. The front cover of the book is a special lenticular material that mimics the shimmering moving water from the DVD menu as you view it from different angles.
2) The glossy photos interspersed throughout the interviews/commentary and episode summaries are very high quality and stylish, many I've never seen before. It's easy to navigate the episode guides and the excerpts of the Atomic County comic are fun to read.
3) The outside is a hard protective plastic shell that protects the inner book from dust and stuff, and you won't ever have to worry about it being damaged if you have to move or something.
4) Season 1 is completely remastered in widescreen. 'Nuff said.
5) Lots of extras and commentary on the extras DVDs.
6) I personally haven't had any problems with DVD's skipping or being scratched.

CONS:

1) I've never been a fan of cardboard DVD sleeves. Sure they're alright I guess, but I'm always paranoid I'm going to scratch the DVDs when taking them in and out, and sometimes the discs fall out if you're too rough.
2) This is a minor nitpick, but if you're a TRUE fan of the OC, you'll notice that the awesome animated shorts of Atomic County are not included on here. You'll have to buy the Atomic County collection on iTunes for a mere 2 bucks :)

2770741,5,B000NJXG6S,"""The O.C."" will always live on as a pop culture teen soap that debut when many thought primetime serials and teen dramas were over. Even the creator had no idea if the show would be a hit or miss. Thanks to exceptional writing, a gifted cast, and stunning photography ""The O.C."" will always be one of my favorite shows.
 The story starts when a family in Orange County, California adopts a young man ,played beautifully by Benjamin Mackenzie who I think will go on to become a future movie star. The stories are fast paced and involving and you truely care as to what happens to the cast of characters. Although the show was promoted as a teen show there are many wonderful stories involving the older characters.
 I recently purchased the entire series boxset and I cannot say enough good things about it. The first season is included in widescreen for the first time, you get a ton of bonus features, and all 92 episodes are included. Warners did a fantastic job in restoring the picture and audio. The boxset comes in book form in the shape of a rectangle with dozens of pictures and neat info on the show. The disc are also put inside the pages safely and are single sided. The set also is encompassed by a see through plastic shell casing that protects the book and discs. Every DVD collector needs to have this set in their collection. It looks stunning!

The set was very beautiful inside and love all the pictures. I do wish that they put more special features though cause they weren't that great.

2770745,4,B000NJXG6S,"Most people know all about the show (which is why they're looking at this product in the first place), so I'll get right into discussing the presentation. For more information on the case, you can see the pictures I've included above.

Inside:
- Each season is color coded.
- Each season has every episode listed, along with the writers and directors of the episode, the date aired, and a plot sypnosis.
- Also included are promotional cast pictures for each season.
- Each season has an ""extras"" DVD which has all the gag reels, sneak peaks, introspectives, etc., that correspond to the season. However, some season discs have additional content that is not included on the extras DVDs. -- For example, the 1st disc of Season One has commentary by the creator, ""A Look at the O.C. Music Guide"" and ""The Model Home"" as extra features which are not found on the extras disc.

Discs:
- There are several discs for each season.
- There is a little pocket for each disc to go into in the cardboard case. However, I find this to be not very intuitive. First of all, I never had the problem of discs falling out -- in fact I had the opposite problem! Some discs are jammed in so hard, that I can't pull them out. Secondly, sliding discs in and out of cardboard (however smooth it may be) worries me. The pockets are not coated with anything soft, and I'm afraid that my discs are going to get scratched if I keep pulling them in and out. Aesthetically it's appealing, practicality-wise it's not.
- However, everything is organized beautifully despite that, and it's very easy to flip back and refer to each episode written inside the case.

The Content:
- The gag reels are hilarious, although the music seems to drown out the dialog on some of them.
- Subtitles (French, Spanish, English) are available.
- Everything is nicely presented. Menus are not complicated. I've had no audio problems (aside from the gag reels), blurry pictures, frozen menus, or anything like that.

Overall, this is definitely a good collectors set, and has a lot of extra content that should keep you occupied for hours. My only problem with this set was the disc storage, and for that it loses 1 star.",1199318400,43,2174,4.609819121447028

2770748,3,B000NJXG6S,"I decided to write a review on this set due to its 5 star rating. The set is definitely a great one; however, it is also flawed.
Let's go on to the good things: It comes with a protective case: a transparent, hard plastic case that doesn't let dust penetrate into the book and CD's. I also liked its size, it is big and the pictures and episode summaries inside are great. I don't usually care for many special features, but I'm sure that diehard fans will be happy with what they offer.

Now, the bad things: The set is very fragile. I absolutely hated the way the CD's are placed on the pages of the book. Any rough movement, they come out of place or fall off the set. When my set arrived, for example, some CD's were already out of place inside the book. The way the set is designed is also weaker than it appears on the picture Amazon displays. By the picture, it looks like the set is completely filled with pages, while in reality, it isn't. There are not as many pictures, interviews, and extra information as I would have expected from the picture. The covers are not as thick as I would like, and the book with the CD's can easily get ruined.

Overall, I am satisfied. At least I didn't have to buy each individual season. This set was released for $120.00, and I thought it was a reasonable price, but its price rose to $160.00, and for that I'm not sure if it is worth it.",1197072000,8,1384,4.238636363636363
2770749,5,B000NJXG6S,"This is a not a review of the O.C.; you've probably already seen that and know what it's all about.  If not, there are other reviews that can tell you all about the content.  This is a review of ""The O.C.: The Complete Series Collection.""  What a beautiful send off for those who were sad to see the show end too soon.

The packaging is really unique.  One thing that is not conveyed by the stock photos is the size--it's really big, about twice as big as I expected.  This is not going to fit easily on your average DVD shelf.  The outer case is solid and the book packaging itself is really well done.  There are some images from the original box sets' booklets as well as some new pictures that I haven't seen before.  The book contains a mix of glossy pages with the episode descriptions and Atomic County excerpts and the thicker cardboard pages holding the discs.  On these pages, there are discs on one side and a photo on the other.

The sleeves for the DVDs are cardboard, but (unlike some other sets) the discs were not scratched when I got the set.  Part of this is because a piece of foam was inserted in between the book packaging and the outer plastic case so that the book didn't slide around and bang against the case during shipping.

The new features are nice but not necessary--if you already have the sets then the decision whether to buy or to stick with season sets is mostly a matter of how much you like this packaging.  I have to say, though, the packaging is pretty dramatic and a lot of effort was put into giving this show the proper treatment.  It's not just a bunch of old discs thrown in a crappy package and called a complete set.",1196294400,66,1662,4.316129032258065
2770750,5,B000NJXG6S,"This DVD set is a great package for any OC fan.  Especially with the added bonuses such as season 1 being presented in widescreen format for the first time.  Another great added feature is the season 4 blooper reel which shows that the cast still seemed to be having fun filming the show in season 4 that they had while filming season 1.
As for The OC as a show, it wasn't Shakespeare, but it was a great escape from the hectic lives we all lead.  The stand-out performers from the series are Rachel Bilson (who made a smooth transition from making the character of Summer Roberts a b*tchy one-dimensional character to making her the most beloved characters of the series), Melinda Clarke (Julie Cooper could have easily have been just a standard antagonist,  but Melinda Clarke made Julie a character you rooted for, even when she was doing less than good deeds), Adam Brody (who's portrayal of Seth Cohen defined the term 'geek-chic'), and a breath of fresh air was brought in season 4 by the delightful Autumn Reeser (took the character of Taylor Townsend from being the annoying girl in season 3 to the lovable and neurotic love interests of Ryan in season 4).
Season 1- The season that started it all.  The show debuted in August and went from being 'The new 90210' to being a pop-culture phenomenon.  The excellence of the first season might also have been the shows downfall since so much story was told in one season that the show sometimes had trouble finding material in further seasons.  The only lowpoint of the season is the character of Oliver, but the show quickly recovered and finished off the rest of the first season in style.
Season 2- The show started off on a shaky note with the main core characters (Summer, Ryan, Seth and Marissa) not being together and functioning as the friends we fell in love with in season 1.  The show suffered from something that many other shows suffer from as well, it tried to introduce too many new characters instead of focusing on the ones we loved in the first season.  But the show came back together mid-way through season 2 and ended with an explosive finale.  Highlights of the season include 'The Mallpisode' and Kelly Rowan's amazing portrayal of playing the perfect mom of Kirsten to slipping to alcohol abuse.
Season 3- The show kicked off it's third year tying up loose ends from the season 2 finale.  It then quickly kicked in to high soap-opera style by milking the melodramatic and losing the humor that the show once had.  Many see this season as the point in the series when people started to lose interests.  The show was no longer the fun escapism that it once was because instead of forgeting about ones own problems they were instead forced to endure the many problems of the characters on the show.  Most of these problems were brought on by the character of Marissa.  Her character over the course of three seasons went through more problems and storylines then most other character go through over a 5+ season series run.  The show finally seemed to be heading in the right direction in the final two episodes.  The season finale ended on the most shocking cliffhanger the series ever had.  The death of a major character.  Highlight of the season is 'The Graduates' this episode ended our core characters high school life in perfect OC fashion and ended on a note that no viewers saw coming.
Season 4- The 4th season of the show brought The OC back to basics.  It beautifully combined the drama and the humor the show did so well in season 1.  In light of the tragic events of the season 3 finale they were able to bring the show back out of the dark hole they fell in to and had some fun once again.  Summers change from the spoiled Newport girl to the activist animal-lover was a delight to see and Rachel Bilson portrayed this beautifully.  Willa Holland and Autumn Reeser were both welcome additions to the cast bringing fun to the show in their potrayals of Kaitlin Cooper and Taylor Townsend.  Melinda Clarke was a stand-out performer in the show's final season.  Her portrayal of a grieving mother out for vengence was well done and her love triangle towards the end of the season was fun to witness.  As the show wound down many wondered if they could end the show in the same style they began with, luckily, they did.  The final episode perfectly wrapped up four years of one of the best teen dramas produced.  The final few minutes of the series can only be described as perfect, because it wrapped up each character in a way that satisfied viewers.  All in all, if you're going to end a series, you want to hope and pray you end it on a good note like the OC did.  To be able to have their final year be just as good as the first is a great accomplishment that the show runners should be very proud of.  Highlights of the final season are Summer's five-steps of grief scene, and the episodes, 'The Shake-Up' and 'The End is Not Near, It's Here.'

Over all, I've enjoyed watching this series and seeing it's progression over the years.  While it had some episodes that were far less than perfect, for the most part it was always a show I could count on to entertain me.  If you already own the previous seasons in their individual sets then this may not be a necessary buy, but if you don't own the series yet then I definitely reccomend it.  An A+ set for such a delightful show.",1196121600,2,5368,4.516028955532575
