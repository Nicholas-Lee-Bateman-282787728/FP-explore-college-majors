8164308,5,B000LV6CBO,Outstanding DVD.  Thanks,1439510400,,24,7.0
8164309,5,B000LV6CBO,"This is a very beautiful DVD. The flowers are absolutely gorgeous. I love the sheer numbers of flowers shown and their vibrant colors. The picture quality is very good. The picture is clear and sharp. I think it was a great idea to include the botanical information for each of the flowers as well. I've learned a lot, and I usually leave that option turned on. The Fun Facts section was a nice addition. The sound options were great and very fitting for the DVD. It is so wonderful to be able to alter your sound from scene to scene or whenever your mood changes. I'm well on my way to owning all of the Ambient DVDs!",1230940800,3,618,4.2905982905982905

This DVD also comes with extras such as choices of music to play, flower information pages, and backgrounds for your computer.  You can even choose to view a certain group of flowers, such as only pink flowers or only white flowers.",1169683200,6,291,4.8979591836734695
