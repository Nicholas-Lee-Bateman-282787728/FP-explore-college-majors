760402,1,6304030959,Movie is fine BUT DVD says Dolby 5.1 there is no rear channel information... May be great on VHS but not worth it for a good home theather setup.,948931200,2,145,4.0344827586206895
760403,4,6304030959,"Definitely a great movie worth the watching. The opening scene is a couple of 19th century boys who bury a box. They are obvioulsy scared - it's a dark night and they can hear wolves. Despite their fear, they agree they  must bury it. One nearly panics as steady drumbeats begins from the board.  They bury it when one boy asks the other, ""But what if somebody finds  it?""
There is a deadly pause before the reply: ""Then God have  mercy on his soul...""
1969, a small town. Alan Parrish discovers the  board and invites his friend to play the game. Yet they unknowingly unleash  powerful forces and Alan is sucked into the game ""until the dice read  five or eight"". His friend is chased screaming out of the house by  bats.
1995 - Two young kids discover the board in their new home and  begin playing, bringing about the arrival of giant mosquitoes and a lion,  and bringing Alan back. Yet there is no way out of the game except to  finish it. During the course of the movie, everything from stampeding  rhinos, to floods, to a crazed hunter with a machine gun appear all  attempting to kill the players.
They succeed in ending the game and the  board is eventually sent downriver, till it enters the sea. There is a  quick epilogue of the characters and how their lives end.
The closing  scene is the best. The board is lying on a beach. Two out-of-focus  characters are seen as the drumbeats begins. One of them says  ""Qu'est-ce que c'est ce bruit?"" The writing underneath translates  - ""What's that noise?""
The movie incorporates the best parts of  movies to create a really good movie - comedy, drama and plenty of  thriller/action with lots of good acting AND special effects. Worthwhile  seeing, but not really worth buying in my opinion. It lacks something I  can't quite put my finger on...
One thing I can say for it - the sound  effects for the movie are really really good in a house of horrors (trust  me, I tried it!)",947808000,9,1930,4.477011494252873
760404,3,6304030959,"A little boy and his friend discover a board game that brings the wild jungle right in his house and takes him prisoner. So many years later, another boy and girl (who move into the boy's house) release him from the  game and have to finish the original in order to send all the jungle  creatures back from wence they came. Excellent special effects keep this  entertaining amid William's usual emmotional style of humor that gets  tiring after 2 or 3 viewings of MRS. DOUBTFIRE. Suspenseful and action  packed with chills if you watch in the theatre. Grier is funny as the cop  and Byrd is pre H20.",945561600,2,599,4.5
760405,3,6304030959,"Plot is ok, in this surprisingly adult film.  Not really for kids, far too serious and intense at certain points.  Actors do a good job, but the producers should have pumped a little more cash into the special effects.  And by the way, just what is the moral of this story????",912729600,2,276,4.372549019607843

761410,4,6304030959,"A board game that could kill you in the process of playing it.  What parent wouldnt let their children play it!?  Once you get past the CGI jungle animals and killer plants, you begin to wonder just how dark this movie is willing to go.  And that leads to Van Pelt, a crazed hunter who pops out of the game and rampages through the town shooting at Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) and anything or anyone else who gets in his way.  Why?  Its never stated, but it could be along the lines of The Most Dangerous Game.  And that brings up the pesky notion of Van Pelt hunting a child who managed to evade him into adulthood when he finally escaped from the game.  And yes, poor Alan was bullied as a child by a gang of boys.  Rich or not, he had a crappy childhood.  Not the most cheerful kids movie ever made.
Even so, I still liked it.",1522886400,,831,4.14375

762237,5,6304030959,"I have always loved Jumanji. I actually saw it in theatres when it was released in December 1995. It includes Robin Williams at his best, a very young Kirsten Dunst, plus Jonathan Hyde in a dual role and others, all adding up to great cinematic chemistry. But two things happened this year, I got a 4K UHD HDR projector for my home theatre for Christmas, and I got the UHD 4K version of Jumanji. I managed to see the new film, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle over the Christmas holidays, and it was a great sequel, so it rekindled my interest in the original and I wasn't disappointed.  Jumanji is the best transfer of an older movie I have yet to see.  The colors are vivid and the cinematography is perfect.  Viewing it on my 110"" screen in 2160p HRD was better than seeing it in the theater!  it was a great film on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD  and Blu Ray but this is the ultimate version of a fabulous film!",1518912000,,903,4.288235294117647

A highly enjoyable film for the whole family. Jumanji was a movie I really enjoyed as a child. Robin Williams is a warm delight to experience his wild delivery and improvised acting. He is as entertaining as ever in Jumanji. Jumanji stars a young Kirsten Dunst as an orphan with her younger brother who must learn to appreciate family.

This is an adventure filled with fun performances, impressive CGI for the time, lots of laughs, and great cinematography and storytelling. The theme of family weighs heavy on the plot. It holds up better than the new remake of Jumanji with The Rock. Check out Jumanji.",1516060800,,625,4.724770642201835

762572,5,6304030959,"I just saw the 2017 Jumanji and thought it would be a good time to finally see the original. Somehow I had missed it through the years. Needless to say there is really not much of a comparison between the two movies other than the name and general story about a mysterious game called JUMANJI.
The 1995 JUMANJI is a bittersweet step back in time seeing a young, handsome and lively Robin Williams at his best. I was never a fan of slapstick, goofy Robin Williams but always appreciated his films that were series and had humor and that is what JUMANJI is. Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) disappeared from his home and has been trapped in the Jumanji game for decades until released by a couple of kids Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce). Alan is released along with an assortment of wild animals and a crazy safari hunter.

JUMANJI is pure fun and adventure as Parrish and the kids try to save their town from destruction and to end the game once and for all. No doubt the GC animals were outstanding by 1995 standards, though they look weak by the current visual effects. This is a fine cast that includes a young Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier and Bebe Nuewirth. It's a fun and enjoyable film and a chance to see the sadly missed Robin Williams at his finest.",1515369600,10,1284,4.487179487179487

Although I have this original on DVD, I never took the time to watch it.  Until now.  The film was directed by Joe Johnston (Captain America: The First Avenger) and starred the late Robin Williams as Alan Parrish.  I was also curious to see Kirsten Dunst as 13 year old Judy Shepherd.  A year after her well-talked about appearance in Interview with the Vampire.

The film opens in 1869 New Hampshire with a Jumanji board game being buried with an ominous voice over of a character stating God help anyone who digs this up.  A quick jump 100 years later and a bullied 13-year old Alan (Adam Hann-Byrd) is upset that his wealthy dad, Sam (Jonathan Hyde) plans on sending Alan to a famous private school.  Alan decides hes leaving home, so packs his suitcase with essentials (a loaf of bread, peanut butter) and heads out.  He stops near an excavation site and finds an old chest which contains the Jumanji game.  He decides to go back home and see whats what.  His friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) comes over and they decide to play the game.

Both are surprised that with a roll of the dice, the pieces move by themselves and bring a message magically as if in a flat crystal ball.  With the first roll, the house is invaded by huge bats.  One of the rules of the game is that you have to continue it to the end in order for everything to go back as it was.  Well young Sarah doesnt want to play anymore, so Alan is swept into the game board as Sarah flees the bats.

The story jumps 26 years and Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) has bought the old house that belonged to the wealthy Parrish family.  She is the aunt of Judy and her younger brother, Peter (Bradley Pierce).  Never completely explained, Judy and Peters parents are dead.  The youngsters find the old board-game in the attic and of course decide to give it a whirl.  The first role of the dice brings giant mosquitos.  And Robin Williams as the older Alan, now freed from inside the game which is evidently a jungle, although we never go there.

Alan, Peter and Judy decide they need to finish the game for things to get back to normal.  But first want to see if they can find Alans old friend, Sarah now played by Bonnie Hunt.  It seems the 26 years since Alan disappeared haven't been good ones for her either.  When asked about what happened to Alan at the time, she told the truth and has been ostracized ever since.  So now they are back to the game and with each roll they get more problem invaders like violent monkeys, spiders, a lion, car-crushing vines and a lunatic hunter named Van Pelt (Hyde again) whose only job is to kill Alan.  No explanation given.

The movie actually had me going early on but things changed for the worse.  It starts out as a tension based fantasy and devolves into a slapstick comedy with occasional frightening sequences that come quickly and exit just as quickly into thin air.  Well except for the monkeys who can now drive cars and motorcycles.  The worst of these scenes involves a policeman played by David Alan Grier.  He and his patrol car are often the brunt of what are calculated focuses of the humor.

I will make another point.  I thought the special effects were pretty bad even for 1995.  The film seems to fall into a black hole in terms of its intended audiences.  Its rated PG but seems a bit too scary for little kids and maybe just a bit too stupid for older kids.  A good story that seems to lose its way.",1513814400,,3548,4.401538461538461

While the special effects had obviously aged, it was still a great watch! I was impressed by how well some of the graphics actually were for the time. Captivating plot with layering storylines that I sadly hadn't caught a lot of as a child. The original Jumanji will always be one of my favorites. If none of that interests you to watch, remember it's Robin Williams, the one and only; he had such an impact on my childhood & I can still see why!

762974,5,6304030959,"As many other reviewers on here, Jumanji was a staple in my childhood VHS collection. Robin Williams was pure magic for children of the 1990's, between Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook and Jumanji he made movies fun for us. Seeing this now as an adult it really is no less special, Williams was a magnificent talent who had a penchant for bringing joy to the lives of others.

I can honestly and unbiasedly say that family films are just not made like this anymore. Jumanji is an adventure movie with the right amount of comic relief for both kids and adults, practically non-stop action, and all wrapped around a genuine heart warming core story about the strength and bond of family and how in the end, there is nothing more important.

Aside from some convincing performances from Williams and Jonathan Hyde (the poacher) something else that made this movie stand out was the incredible and ""John Williams-eque"" score from James Horner (a legend in his own right). Movies like this were meant to be passed down from generation to generation as the message here is a timeless one.",1496620800,2,1070,4.747311827956989

763369,5,6304030959,"We just watched Jumanji with our 8 year old.  I am sure that other parents have anticipated the thrill of sharing something with a child only to discover that the child is not interested.  Not this time.  She loved it, not even leaving during commercials.  One of mom's and dad's favorite movies has become a family favorite.  Now if she will only appreciate THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (the original of course) when she is a little older.  And BRINGING UP BABY and HARVEY and....

763749,4,6304030959,"Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend.",1467244800,,1581,4.344594594594595

764183,4,6304030959,"Released in 1995, Jumanji is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role.

Jumanji is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. Its entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If youve lost sight of your inner-kid give Jumanji a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasiers psychologist babe on Cheers).

The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area.

The characters are fun, there is a lot of humor, and nothing that is going to embarrass you in front of your kids.  There was some repetition and a couple of times I wondered why they didn't just roll the dice faster but that would have taken away from the story.  I have no problem recommending this movie.

Underneath the over the top plot line and special effects though, there is a very serious point about being thankful for the things that you have and about how nothing is more important than family as we sometimes get lost in our day to day lives. Of course, this message is wrapped in this rather crazy package of stampeding animals, dangerous situations and Robin Williams antics that makes the watcher forget his minds worries for ninety minutes or so.",1447027200,5,711,4.51937984496124

764474,5,6304030959,"1869  Brantford NH USA : A small wooden chest is placed in a hole, in the ground, about 1 mile from the town centre.  The chest, giving-out with a pulsating drumbeat and a repetitive, almost hypnotic, rhythm is giving grave concern to the two young lads who are burying it.  Even the two horses, drawing the cart, are displaying discomfort and a strange temperament in the proximity of the chest.  And, 100 years later, when it is re-discovered, can the temptation, to open the same pulsating chest, be contained?  This film is NOT for the Feint-hearted BUT it is made for [older] children to view AND Only in the company of a Responsible Adult, Present for the Duration.  It is Absolutely Fantastic, in the superlative.  The acting, the animation, the sound Everything about it is a Total Blast.  Just Dont Miss It!  Also, there is a 'Virtual Board Game', for 2-4 players, on the disk.

765088,2,6304030959,"When i found out that sony pictures were reissuing this classic Robin williams film on blu-ray again
as a Anniversary edition, a 20th Anniversary edition actually i knew i had to buy it
it made more sense to buy this new reissue than the old 2008 Blu-ray+DVD set

now being a 20th Anniversary blu-ray i expected new special features apart from the usual making of featurettes from the old dvd version
man was i Disapointed when i bought myself a copy
about the HD transfer, i do think the picture quality wasn't enhanced at all with new 2015 blu-ray technology
Sony just recycled the old 2008 HD transfer, still better HD transfer than the old Digital remaster picture quality
but being an Anniversary edition i expected a new HD transfer for sure maybe a new 4k transfer
How stupid of sony just to recycle the transfer again, there are lots of Idiots at sony
the sound quality is no Different either, it's the same 5.1 master audio mix same as the old 2008 blu-ray

now about the special features, well Sony have advertised new extras on this new reissue
but Hardly worth watching i tell you, waste of Disc space if you ask me
FROM THE CAST OF GOOSEGUMPS,
which is only a 5min interview with 2 Actors from the upcoming Goosebumps film
talking about the Jumanji movie and about their favourite scenes in the movie that's all you get,
a very very pointless interview, very stupid idea
 the sony executive who thought of this Idea for this new Anniversary blu-ray
should get the Brain examined or Fired very very stupid pathetic idea
GOOSEBUMPS-REFLECTIONS ON JUMANJI which is just a preview of the upcoming Goosebumps movie that's all
nothing exciting
there's also Episodes from Jumanji Animated series and the original theatrical trailers
that's all you get for new extras for this new Anniversary edition- what an insult
also what else is on this blu-ray is the usual making of featurettes from the very old dvd release
which is to be expected anyway.
what Sony should have done which would've made more sense
is to make a new retrospective featurette on the film with new interviews with Director Joe Johnston
Actress Kirsten Dunst, Actress Bonnie Hunt, Actor Bradley pierce with them giving their recollections working on the film
not to get 2 Actors from the Goosebumps film to talk about the film Jumanji and give their favourite scenes of the film
very stupid, stupid stupid
but of course Sony couldn't be bothered making any effort to get new interviews with some of the cast from the film
Jumanji deserves more respect no Doubt about it
a new HD transfer, maybe a new 4k transfer and new retrospective featurette at least
probably better to keep the old 2008 blu-ray
1-2 stars for this new Anniversary edition, very poor pathetic effort by Sony",1443052800,3,2752,4.729166666666667

765432,4,6304030959,"There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws.

Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change.

The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating.

The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change)

The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that ""I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll"" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters.

It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes

""In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight""  Jumanji ""Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more""  Gautam",1440979200,,3527,4.449612403100775

770197,5,6304030959,"I watched Jumanji since I was a kid growing up. I couldn't watch it at around age 8 because I was scared of a certain scene in the movie where J li (Short for Jumanji Lion. I called him that after Robin was deceased) was awake from a nap. And the scene where Nora opened her bedroom door and J li frightened her away. I dreamt last night (February 19th 2015) of a scene where Alan, Judy and Peter came to Sarah. Instead of a door open, close and then open again, it went back and forth opening and closing the door over and over again. Then I heard a voice say: ""What do you want with Sarah Whittle?"" and the scene went on as usual. Later I heard a voice saying in a crying/shouting voice: ""People called me crazy since my husband got sucked into the game!"" We used to have it at home. My parents sold it at the flea market. We didn't have it at home since until I bought it at Target for $5.00 (plus .25 tax). Now I have it in my own home and I loved it so much that I wanted to add this to my other children's movies. I don't know if it's a something we watch at home or if it's something worth showing my renowned respite providers who are trying to protect me. I don't think J li was trying to attack Alan, Judy and Peter. I think he was roaring, chasing, backing Alan as he was walking and growling, etc. He was behaving like a cat or a dog at home. Or even behaved like a human. A real lion would sleep longer than J li. (For 20 hours or more.) Plus he didn't look like a real lion from seeing the appearance of the face and body. It's my grandmother's favorite movie. It's amazing. Critics think that it's not suitable for younger kids and should think that it should've been PG-13. I don't believe in that.",1424390400,5,1714,4.07396449704142

772387,5,6304030959,"Jumanji is one of my favorite family films that is starred by the late and great Robin Williams. This game is almost similar to the storybook. I watched this film when I was a child and I loved it. This film takes place in mid 90's two children found a board game in a attic from their house, but it is not an normal board game and it is filled with magical surprises and dangers included a man (Williams) that is sucked to the game when he was a child while he played Jumanji in 1969. The man and the children have to finish the game to restore everything to normal. This film is so funny, but a bit scary. I gave this film a 5 star rating and I recommended this film to everyone who had a family. R.I.P.

Anyway, this film is wonderful with its fun and fantastical storyline.
Sure, the CG animals are laughably unrealistic but they are fantastical versions of real animals we know.
Robin Williams really had a streak of family fun films during this era... so do not miss out if you've never seen it before.
The film also has some memorable scenes and Bebe Neuworth.
There is a quasi-sequel to this film and it is an equally wonderful film for the whole family, it has that twilight chick in it.

772972,4,6304030959,"Adapted from the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg (liberally, for the book is quite short), Jumanji is the story of young Alan Parish who after being assailed by a group of bullies, runs into a construction site and discovers a boardgame buried in a trunk inside a dirt wall after hearing the sound of drums which leads him to the discovery.  He takes the game home and when Sarah Whittle, a school chum and potential sweetheart,  brings his bike that the bullies had stolen, they get caught up playing the game when she hears the drums too. Something happens every time you roll the dice.  Something terrible.  Sarah is chased out of the house by giant bats as Alan gets sucked into the board game.  27 years later Peter and Judy Shepherd move into the house with their aunt following the sudden, tragic death of their parents. Rumor has it that Alan Parish was murdered, his body somewhere stashed inside the enormous house by his father.  Peter hears the drums.  As they investigate the attic they discover Jumanji.  Rolling the dice starts the game.  But there are two pieces already on the board.  Giant mosquitoes appear.  A lion.  Monkeys..  And suddenly Alan Parish (Robin Williams) 27 years later.  They must complete the game to make everything disappear and go back to normal.  Only problem, it's Sarah Whittle's turn. They have to find her.
Jumanji is just one of those family flicks that you can watch again and again.  I remember it scared my younger daughter to death when the rhinos stampede out of the bookcase in the library, but other than that shock, she was all right with it.  A strange, dark, adventurous movie.  One of the few Kirsten Dunst (Interview With A Vampire being the other) that I can stomach.  Williams is Williams, which is funny and a little neurotic.  David Alan Grier is hysterical.  Jonathan Hyde plays the duel role of Alan's father and the hunter sprung from the game bent on Alan's destruction (hmmmmm, is there a hidden theme there?). Bonnie Hunt plays the mystified, panic-inclined grown up version of Sarah perfectly.  Always a pleasure to watch.  Looks great on Blu-ray.

In all the articles that were written after his death there is rarely a mention of Jumanji, but it is a must-see for anyone who appreciated his work as an actor.",1410566400,,323,4.684210526315789

773252,4,6304030959,"I watched this film to see Robin Williams in it. I am a senior. It is more a film for families than for seniors although if you have grandchildren, it will be a good choice for them.

The plot revolves around releasing the fantastic elements of a board game into the real world. The trick is getting them back into the board game and out of the real world. Robin Williams has been trapped there for 26 years, inside the game world. Now he has come back to the house and town where he used to live. But he has to help the whole town and the new family who has moved into his house.

The special effects are dated since technology has moved on by almost 20 years but they do the job. Kirsten Dunst has a role as a grade school age kid in the film.

773330,5,6304030959,"Upon the demise of the wonderful Robin Williams, I realized I have very few of his films. Of course, I have ""Garp"", but it's a horribly edited version of the original, which I saw in the theater; there's no ""real"" version of it on DVD. I ordered this Blu, and am completely happy with it. The insanity of it all looks terrific on Blu, and I'm amazed it didn't get an Oscar nom for Visual Effects.

Kirsten Dunst was fresh off her auspicious debut in ""Interview with a Vampire"", and is a natural. All of the kid actors are good. Jonathan Hyde is also impressive, playing a dual role (a psychological subtext).

I always thought director Joe Johnston was under-rated. He handles the very complicated material in a way clear enough to be easily understood. I recommend this film, to show how Williams brilliantly combined manic and serious in a most enjoyable entertainment.",1409443200,6,871,4.686274509803922

773518,5,6304030959,"I first saw this movie in 1995 in the theater and I loved it. It's no Jurrasic Park of course, but the story and the characters are just great! The late Robin Williams' character gives a great performance as one that discovers the game in a construction zone and takes it home. He opens it and unknowingly picks up the characters used for the board. His girl ""friend"" is over and ultimately finds herself playing along with him. Soon, though, it turns out this is no ordinary game like Monopoly. Reality sets in they are in for big trouble. He disappears into the game in a jungle atmosphere and must wait there until someone roles a 5 or 8. His girl friend runs screaming from the house as she is terrorized by flying bats that chase her out and down the street. Years later, they meet up again to continue the game after a couple of kids that live in his former home find it and decide to play along. Now, 4 are on the board and fighting for their very lives in whatever comes out of the game!

Yes, this is from 1995, an era of CGI that saw Jurassic Park as well. Some animation looks a bit dated, but nonetheless, it did not distract me from having fun and believing those characters did actually come from the board game. 10 years from now, some will say the movie CGI of today will look weak and dated. Just enjoy the movies people and don't rely so much on CGI for everything. It's about having a good time watching the movie.

I recommend this set to anyone that loved Robin Williams' movies. The bluray looks and sounds good in DTS 5.1. I watched it on my Sony 40"" LED. There is plenty of features to enjoy as well.

They will go out and try to dig up something talking about they found Jumanji.  There is a house on our nomal route that they describe as Alan's house.  It could be a little much for some children, but mine have always liked intense movies.  I actually have a board game by the same title, but my copy dosent play drums or suck people into it.

Movie summray (no spoilers)
Some kids bury something they are obviously scared of.  The item beats drums that only the people it picks can herar.  Years later Alan (12 year old boy) heras the drums and finds a board game.  The inscription reads, ""a game for those who seek to leave thier world behind.""  This describes Alan, so he drops the pieces on the board, the game then can interprt the dice reading and move your pieces.  The game begins to come to life, sending creatures after the players and even sucks poor Alan into the jungle of Jumanji.  Still years later, more children move into Alan's old house and find the game.  They realize that if they finish the game, all of the bad things will go away.  After freeing Alana from the jungle, they do just that. (Alan never finished the game, so they are playing the one he started.)  Several interesting things happen as the game progresses, from gigantic mosquitos to a stampeed of jungle animals.",1377475200,2,1459,4.511450381679389

It will be a classic, along the lines of The Wizard of Oz and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  I remember being a little scared by flying monkeys the first time I saw the Wizard of Oz, but that's part of the fun. My kids, ages 7 to 11, love this movie.  I think my kids could easily tell the animals were not real. But if your kids tend to frighten easily, they could be scared by the giant mosquitoes.  I liked the lessons learned by Robin Williams' character, Alan, and Alan's father - Understand that your parents are trying to do what they think is best, but if you don't agree, talk it out; take time to listen to your kids, love them and really appreciate them. Overall, a great film with all the actors doing a fantastic job.",1373587200,,824,4.229299363057325

The creature effects are intentionally cartoon like (which makes them still funny in a good way even by today's standards) and the story is just fun and well paced. Jonathan Hyde as Van Pelt (and Alan's father) was amazing and the movie is just a joy to watch by kids and adults alike.,1361491200,,423,4.367088607594937

Not all Blu Ray movies, especially older movies transfered to the Blu Ray format, are created equal, as many are aware, but this one is pretty good, especially if it can be had at a reduced price. [-;

As an adult watching it, the escapism that comes with the movie is certainly worth watching with or without the kids, again and again.

Every child imagines a life of rolling the dice to see what awaits.  (And what a delightful parallel of life, the rolling of the dice and never knowing what's around each corner).  How imaginative this movie is and what a wonderful way for the kids, and adults too, to spend an afternoon.

The special effects in this are nothing short of amazing and ahead of their time.  Robin Williams is a wonderful man/child drawing viewers into the story with him.

775430,5,6304030959,"Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play. But remember: once you start this game, you can't stop. If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.  ""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things. Only finishing the game will make it all go away.  In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added. Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself. He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing. The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams! Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.  Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles. He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt. The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type. The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page). Highly recommended for old and young alike.",1254441600,2,1892,4.591715976331361

775432,3,6304030959,"I couldn't wait to see JUMANJI when it first came out in the mid-Nineties.  A magical board game that brings the wilds of the jungle to life?  Action, mayhem, and special effects?  Robin Williams?  Sign me up!

Yet I walked away from the theater disappointed with this movie; and the other day after viewing it on cable my disappointment hasn't wavered.  While some scenes were certainly exciting and entertaining, for the most part JUMANJI was annoying--from David Alan Grier's (who added nothing to this film) wrecked police cruiser, to Robin Williams's ""poor me"" sappiness, to Kirsten Dunst being an irritating smart aleck, to a young Bradley Pierce whimpering with monkey makeup on.  Yuck.  And the special effects. . .let's just say CGI has come a long way since the last decade.  No, the monkeys and spiders and bats and elephants and the lion and rhinos did not look real.  And what, pray tell, was the point in playing this (terrifying) game in the first place?  Games are played for fun--not to teach near-lethal life lessons.

Now the good.  Jonathan Hyde was fun to watch in his dual role as Williams's father/hunter-protagonist; and Bebe Neuwirth is always easy on the eye, no matter what the venue.  And I liked the juvenile, bawdy, irreverent orneriness of the game board itself; in many ways it was the best character in JUMANJI, and kept the movie from rolling snake eyes.

That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.

The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.

Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way.

775501,5,6304030959,"In a nutshell, the movie is about a predated, enchanted board game (as proven through the prologue where the previous players frantically dispatch of it almost a hundred years before our stories actually starts) placed into the hands of Alan Perish, a thirteen year old growing up in New England in 1969.  At first, to Alan and his friend Sarah, it seems ordinary, but with a roll of the dice, things change to the very worst.  The game play itself, including bats, monkeys, lions and other deadly elements actually become real, animated... and lethal.  Twenty-six years later, another pair of children get their hands on it, reactivating its dormant magic.  Alan and Sarah return, and the four of them vow to put an end to all the irreparable harm this game has caused for the, the town and their very lives.

I remember when I was the second grade, (almost twelve years ago) when my mother was having her book club at our house and my father took my sister and I out to the movies.  Honestly, I had no idea what Jumanji was (I saw like, a thirty second advertisement for the merchandised board game and maybe five seconds worth of the actual film) and had no idea what I was getting into.

Everyone in this section is dead right when they say this movie is dark on a massive scale.  Sorry, but a happy family film doesn't contain the concepts of murder, mayhem and intensified chaos.  Honestly, when I was at my local Metropolitan Theater when it first came out, I almost couldn't take it.  I wanted to either hide underneath my foldout seat or even resort to the classic juvenile excuse told during the rising action or climax of a film of this nature, also known as, ""I have to go to the bathroom!""  Regardless of that, though, I just couldn't stop watching.  Maybe it was the mystery of how in the world the characters were going to get out of this catastrophic situation.  It could have been the special effects were revolutionary.  After all, in the mid-nineties, creating one hundred computer-generated special effects was almost on heard of (Independence Day was mostly stop-motion animation and Jurassic Park basically relied on actual animatronics, both with very few CGI involved) and looked so real.  But... the fact remained that this film was to be my obsession for about one quarter of my elementary schooled life.

This week (in the middle of my third year of college) I found my old VHS tape of this particular film while in pursuit of another (my major is film studies and production) and decided, meh... what the heck.  A little nostalgia never hurt, right?

Instead of just watching it for pure enjoyment, I could now analyze it in a more critical and more understanding way.  I thought it wasn't going to do much for me, but (dated family film, not much chance of finding any true thematic qualities) but nevertheless, that didn't appear to be the case.  Unlike the other popular live-action family films within ten years of this film coming out (the Indian in the Cupboard, Homeward Bound, Honey I Shrunk the Kids), this one seemed to have deeper meaning in how events shape the lives of our youth.  When Alan returns home, he see's the beautiful town he had once called his home (a more obvious example would be the statute of his family patron, once a shining beacon in the middle of a beautiful and lush green park, now pretty much a rusted graffiti tagged eyesore, centered on top of what has become something akin to scorched earth) now residing as a dying city reeking bankruptcy and homeless civilians.  This clearly demonstrates what happens when one avoids responsibility, and how it affects not only you, but also the people directly involved with your life.  And the fact that the game continues to cause additional mayhem and destruction demonstrates how continuously fleeing responsibility can only get worse and worse.

And for those who noticed--no... it's not coincidence that the protagonist's father, is the same actor as the homicidal hunter Van Pelt (who appears to be nothing short of an evil entity seemingly taken from Richard Connell's short story ""The Most Dangerous Game""--wow... the irony!).  The hunter is actually a living, breathing metaphor of how difficult it can be to face and overcome the harshest facts of life--aka, dealing with the strained relationship of Alan and his father.  This sort of plays on the same technique the original play of Peter Pan demonstrated when Captain Hook was the same actor as Wendy, John and Michael's father.

And if in the event you're juggling between Jumanji and that ""other"" movie about an enchanted board game, ""trust me""--leave Zathura on the shelf or in the bargain bin, where it belongs.  For unlike its predecessor, Zathura (which I only watched because it debuted on my prepaid additional cable sometime back) has the flash, the action and special effects that made Jumanji what it was--but unlike the original, its main purpose seems to be to only entertain and has absolutely no thematic qualities to speak of.  Furthermore, any morale that you see in it is pretty much shoved down your throat and leaves no room for any real progress in mental contemplation.  Now, let's leave this nonsense behind and continue.

While there are some tiny flaws with the acting and screenplay--there really isn't much to dock this rating in the slightest.  My only warning is, if you are going to watch with your family, make sure your child, grandchild, little brother/sister, whatever is ""at least"" in the upper elementary, as many scenes might prove to be too intense.

So let me close by saying ""for those who wish to seek to find a way to leave your world behind"" give this movie a go and remember what made family film so powerful just a decade before.",1224288000,4,5744,4.763874873864783

And with that snobbish aside, from a person I formerly respected as a humanist, a million kids - who live in trailer parks or the equivalent - were ushered out of the fun.

On the surface, Jumanji appears to be an actual child's game, meant for amusement purposes, with a surprising twist. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that Jumanji itself is NOT a game, but a metaphor for the difficulties our souls must face before we can confront our fears. At the beginning of the film, Alan Parish is burdened by his inability to confront his fears; a problem which may, in an almost Freudian manner, stem from a strained relationship with his own father. ""Jumanji"" is a physical representation of this burden, and since at the time he is unable to confront it, he is pulled into the jungle of his fears, unable to escape. He overcomes his flaws not only when he ""beats the game"", but, as we see thanks to both Van Pelt and Alan's father being played by the same actor, when he finally has the strength to confront his father. I did not care for the subplot involving jungle animals wreaking havoc on the city, but this is merely an unhelpful footnote in a powerful story of one boy's self-actualization.",1209254400,,1056,4.682795698924731

It all starts out with a little boy ""Alen"" is having a tough time.  He is poicked on at school, does not have any friends and his parents want him to go to a school in which he does not want to go.  Then one day he goes to a place where there is a company doing construction.  He hears drums playing.  He finds a game called Jumanji.  He runs home and hides it.  Then his parents leave to do something and him and a girl start playing.  Things start to happen as they do.  Bugs start flying around and bats start flying.  The game comes alive.  Then the boy rools something and the game bord tells him ""in the jungle you must wait until the dice reads 5 or 8.  He is sucked into the game.  The girl gets so affraid that she runs out of the house with bats chasing her.  Like 20 years go by and a lady and her sisters 2 kids (I think it was her sister) move in.  The kids find the game and start playing.  One of them rolls a 5 or 8 and the man is set free.  He has aged as the time has gone by.  He ends up playing the game with them to finish it.  But he needs to get the girl whom played with him all those years ago to play as well because it is her turn.  She screams when he arrives to ask her and he tricks her into playing.  They all play the game and alot of crazy exciting things happen.  I can not tell you what happens because that would ruin it for you.  Buy this movie.  It is well written.

I had avoided this movie when it came out, dismissing it as fare for kids (and I had none at the time), However, in the midst of all the mindless stuff the media releases in the guise of 'family entertainment,' this thoughtful yet thrilling movie is the real deal.

When 12 year old Allan Parrish shouts to his father that he ""will never speak to him again!"" he has no idea that he is about to (literally) get sucked into a board game that will leave him vanished without a trace, his friend Sarah traumatized at having bore witness to his disappearance, and the disintegration of his own family's fortunes as a result.

When Judy and Peter find the board game and unwittingly bring Allan back 26 years later, it's up to Allan to understand the consequences of his actions to put right everything that has gone wrong.

There are a great many teachable moments in this breath-taking movie, and you don't have to look too hard for them, either. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and I found myself enjoying it right along with them--a rare treat! Highly recommended.",1171929600,2,1144,4.538834951456311
775637,5,6304030959,"In 1989 Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID initiated a significant renaissance of family films of both the animated and live action variety. There were actually quite a few live action family films produced up through the mid 90s that combined outrageous situations, sentimental plotting and good doses of visual mayhem to entertain most audiences. Some of these films such as HOME ALONE (1990), BEETHOVEN (1992), HOMEWARD BOUND: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1993) and DENNIS THE MENACE (1993) were the staples of this renaissance. By the mid 90s the appeal of such films seemed to be waning. 1995's JUMANJI seemed to be one of the last of the films to gain recognition and prominence at least to the audiences that went to see it. Many of the noted critics at that time were not exactly enamored with this film.

I sat in the theatre thinking that this was one of the most innovative films to come along for some time. It not only contained those elements that characterized the aforementioned family films but also combined convincing (for that time) digital effects, real drama, danger and concluded with an important message that parents and children should take the time to take note of each other. They should not take each other for granted and not create impenetrable boundaries around themselves. Unfortunately as seen in this film, a boy most grow into manhood before he understands that perhaps his father does not know how to approach him.

JUMANJI is filled with action and many special effects that really are elements of the catharsis that Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) must endure before he can ever possibly go home again. Watching this film again recently I was touched by the scene where Robin Williams visits the old family shoe business to find the factory empty and closed down. It is now a makeshift home for a transient old man who barely remembers the fate of Williams' dad. That scene counterbalanced with the score that James Horner had composed of the earlier New England setting was bittersweet. Watching that scene I also drifted back to the time when this film was first released. They really don't make films like this any more. Those were the good old days. And it's really not that long ago. For a while the studios were making intelligent films for the whole family that weren't afraid to make you feel for the characters as well as laugh with them. I have fond memories of JUMANJI.",1170201600,,2405,4.834951456310679
775638,4,6304030959,"... is, I think, the best word for this film. As stated in an earlier review, most films are take-offs on dog-earred, thumb-smudged plots and tend only to restate what has been done before. This is especially true of many of today's productions where the film is an out-and-out remake of the earlier film. Often the title is not even changed.

But this story is different. I can't remember any film which has the same idea -- of a boy finding a board game and playing it with his friend only to unleash dire results.

The tale has been recounted in other reviews, so no need for me to restate it. Let's just say that this is a refreshing breath of air in an industry which has become stale in it's repeatition. Visuals are nice, but one can tell they are computer generated.

Older kids and adults will enjoy the story, I think, though I would be cautious about very young children watching. The movie could easily inspire dark dreams for those under age 8 (or so).

The film flows and has a really nice, unexpected twist at the end. Well worth the build up. I think most who watch the movie will like it. And of course it features Robin Williams.

775741,5,6304030959,"Just about every film you will ever watch (with a few acceptions) will have been influenced by another film, and may seem very similar to that film in more ways than one. However, Jumanji is a complete acception to this rule. It is a completely original and fantstic idea for a film, which has become unsuprisingly succesful.

When Alan Parish finds an old game in a building site and begins playing it with Sarah, a girl on his street, he dissappears and she is chased out of the house by a swarm of bats. Twenty Six years later, Judy and Peter find it in the attic of there new house, (the old Parish house) and they also begin to play. They release Alan, along with a hoard of unimaginable nightmares, their only hope being to finish the game, if they live that long!

The special effects in this movie, in there day were excelent, however they do look a little bit dated now, especially the lion. It still works well though. The acting is also pretty ok, especially from Robin Williams, who in my mind is on top form here.

Although this film was promoted as a family movie, some parts are pretty intense and scary, especially the beginning where the previous two children are burying the game. Therefore you may want to watch it before you show it to very young children. Having said this, it really is an excelent film and most of the family can enjoy the solid entertainment.

If you buy this film then i guarentee that you will be gripping your seat,and will be thinking of nothing else until the end. Well worth buying.",1151280000,6,1528,4.465949820788531

775744,4,6304030959,"I often seem to wonder why movies out there can be just outrageous at times. Nevertheless, I also know that there just aren't that many good movies out there right now which is shallow. That also goes with the same for great actors like Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, and the legendary Robin Williams. In the 1990's he was just everywhere as one of the funniest performers in comedy, and a fantastic actor to the bone. He was just great in films like Mrs. Doubtfire, The Birdcage, and arguably one of the most outrageous and the most exciting films of the time, Jumanji.

Jumanji with Robin Williams, is about a young boy who feels his life is full of doubts and heartbreak finds a outrageous game, which turns fully interactive. When he comes back in the future, he has no idea of what life leads from the death of his parents, to finding a childhood friend, Sara Wittle played by Helen Hunt. Then, they have to finish the game they started in the years earlier. The movie is absolutely amazing with beautiful graphics from the wicked floods, to the calming lion sleeping in the bed of the house, and even the shocking thrill of the hunt as a British hunter also comes into play with the dice. The effects in the movie are absolutely unique and amazing from each details of the rhinos stampedeing, to the unique mutation of young Peter. The film also remains very unique and fun for all ages.

All in all with the recently released film Zathura in theaters, many may want to still consider that film. However, you may still want to see its competition, Jumanji first. I really loved this film the first time I saw it in the theaters about a decade ago, and if you've enjoyed it you know you have too. If you haven't seen Jumanji yet, you don't know what you're missing with the roll of the dice.

775745,4,6304030959,"The rhythmical thumping of exotic drums awakens innocent curiosity and a desire for adventure.  As the drumming intensifies in both volume and beat, inquisitiveness strengthens together with a slowly escalating heartbeat.  The combination gives a heightened level of attentiveness and physical alertness presents an opportunity of tense anticipation within the individual.  However, the personal eagerness for suspense could reaches a point beyond personal safety and comfort where fear begins to affect the individual.  Jumanji's rhythmical pounding helps tap on the idea of adventure, suspense, and fear through the nave consciousness of children, which delivers a fantastic adventure that enters a magical realm of the perilous mystery.

A twirling green glowing fog shapes the letters Jumanji while a swooshing sound slashes through a distant howling opens the film.  Consequently, the camera fades into a dark forest somewhere in the New England region where an adolescent and his younger brother swiftly move with purpose through the foggy night.  The year is 1869 and the brothers are about to bury a padlocked strongbox in a remote location with the intention of securing the world from its content.  In the dark hours of the secretive burial, horses twitchingly move while remote cries of wolves amplify the horror of the moment.  Yet, the two children persist to submerge the chest within the earth, as a frightful hammering on drums seems to be coming from within the box.  At the final stage of the entombment of the chest, the younger brother wonders what would happen if someone would find it.  Fearfully the older brother utters the words, ""May God have mercy on his soul.""  The suspense can undoubtedly escape the audience's attention in this brief opening.

One hundred years later, in the idyllic town of Brantford the young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds himself in a fearful situation with a group of bullying kids.  His father too busy to listen, as he runs a successful shoe factory, demands that Alan faces his fears.  Without the fatherly safety, Alan finds himself alone and abandoned, and thuggish kids are outside waiting for him.  He has no other choice than face the beating. Afterwards, anger and sadness drift through him, but something catches his attention.  A distant rhythmical drumming is coming from a construction site close by his father's factory where he unearths the strongbox that the two boys buried a hundred years earlier.  Inside the box, Alan finds another box with the inscription Jumanji, which turns out to be a board game.  After additional arguments with his father, Alan opens the game with his friend Sarah, but to their dismay they realize that the game has a very real and dangerous secret.  Again, suspenseful anticipation seems to grow within the audience.

Twenty-six years later, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) move into the mansion where Alan once lived with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), as they have recently lost their parents in an accident.  Both Judy and Peter struggle with several issues at the same time such as their bereavement of their parents, the relocation, and having to live with their aunt.  Yet, they have no idea what other struggles are awaiting for them when they too begin to hear the outlandish drumming coming from the attic.  Nonetheless, Judy and Peter open Jumanji and unlock its secret by a simple roll of the dies.  Here the film truly begins its rapid fall, after a slow climb on the roller coaster, which will swiftly throw the audience around in an amusing and suspenseful adventure.

Now the question is whether Jumanji upholds the quality after the initial twenty minutes.  However, asking this in the review for Jumanji automatically suggests that the film falters, and Robin Williams has not even entered the story yet.  Not that Williams' performance is bad. On the contrary, his acting actually elevates the quality of the film, as it makes use of a heavy dose of CGI graphics and special effects.  The storyline is a little thin and the film feels too much like a video game where the heroes try to avoid monsters and creatures in order to stay alive.  At times, the film sends out vibes similar to the cheat mode of invincibility turned on in a video game, which ultimately reveals the notion of a successful conclusion.  Despite the flaws of the film, it offers a remarkable swift roller coaster that undoubtedly will keep many viewers attention through its flashy special effects and thrilling amusement.",1131753600,9,4534,5.061911170928668

Bradley Pierce did good for an actor that I had never heard of before.  Joe Johnston made some great special effects.

It has some pretty inventive special effects, and its premise is neat in that you never know what you get with the roll of the dice.  Giant mosquitos?  Spiders?  Mad monkeys?  A stampede of African animals?  A crazed hunter?  Floods, etc., etc.  While the movie sometimes drifts off on unnecessary tangents, it's still a whirlwind of fantastical adventures.  Robin Williams, the king of playing grown men who act like children, is remarkably restrained as Alan Parrish, a young boy who was sucked into the game back in 1969 and is released in 1995 by a young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce.  In order to stop all the horrendous things happening, they must finish the game Alan started in 1969, which includes his now adult girlfriend, lovingly played by Bonnie Hunt.  Of course, the demented hunter (Jonathan Hyde in a dual role as the hunter and Alan's rather loutish father) doesn't want the game finished.

I have never seen kids so engaged in a movie as they were with Jumanji. They shouted warnings to the characters, jumped back when animals charged and instinctively raised their feet when floodwaters filled the house during the movie. The youngest has since begged me to let her take it to school to show her class.

Personally, I thought it was cute and entertaining. As to buying it, I wouldn't if it was just for me but having seen the way my kids behaved while watching it, I'll be getting it in a heartbeat.",1100563200,3,680,4.354330708661418
775826,4,6304030959,"During one of my late nights I watched Jumanji again.  This is a film starring Robin Williams and is based on a children's book (if by based one can mean it shares the title and a few illustrations).  The film was released as a special effects extravaganza but failed to live up to the advertising.

Jumanji is a mysterious board game.  Once you start to play you have to end the game.  Each roll of the dice unleashes some new nasty obstacle that must be overcome.  This can be giant mosquitos and spiders, monkeys and lions, earthquakes, stampedes, quicksand and carnivorous vines, or something even nastier.  When Robin Williams was a young boy he found the game buried at a construction site.  The opening moves resulted in Williams being banished to the game until someone rolls a five or an eight.  Unfortunately no one believes the young girl who had been playing the game with him.

The scene jumps ahead twenty-six years to the present and the new residents of the house find the old game and begin to play.  Williams is returned, now twenty-six years older and very jungle-wise.  The first things out of the game were destructive enough that the kids decide to finish the game so that everything will be back to normal.  Unfortunately the game thinks there are now four players.  Williams must find his childhood friend and convince her to continue the game.

As more and more destructive forces are released we learn that Williams's disappearance caused the town to go into a tailspin.  The new horrors just speed up the decay.  The four players face frustrating and deadly things as they finally finish the game.  In the end all is returned to normal.  The normal of when the game was started twenty-six years previously.  Williams is now a kid again.  The scene jumps to the present again and the town is prosperous while Williams tracks down the kids he finished the game with.

This is a very intense film and was probably not suited for the young target audience.  This was marketed as a fun fantasy cor children, but what this film is in fact is juvenile horror.  Not bad horror, but horror aimed at kids.  Taken in that light it is a very well done film with tense moments, humor and subtleties and is worth checking out.

775932,4,6304030959,"This is one of the seemingly rare films that you can watch as a kid, and then watch as an adult, and don't hate it because, cos it seems ""childish"" now. It's like the Narnia stories by C.S. Lewis, I can read those as an adult, be transported to when I was a kid, and not understanding the religious undertones, to reading it as an adult, and understanding them.
I love Robin Williams films. He's one of the best older actors around at the moment, although one of my all-time fave films will be Miss Doubtfire. You get his full range of voices, and funny characteristics in that film. In Jumanji, he's more serious, but in the extras, he's back to his Miss Doubtfire funniness. There's one particularly line, while they're filming the earthquake sequence, and Robin Williams is hanging onto Bonnie Hunt for dear life. In the extras, you actually see he's standing on a plank of wood. Then you see this guy sawing away at something, and Robin goes ""That can't be good"". It's just the way he comes out with these things!
Of all the special effects in this movie, the monkeys are the best - sorry, the lion isn't a patch on Aslan. They are so hilarious, whether they're in the kitchen (the monkey switching on the cooker, and nearly getting his a** burnt!), or on the motorbike (monkey with massive helmet on!)
The extras are kinda disappointing for a collectors edition. There are a few good documentaries, but they show a lot of the same clips over and over. Some of it is interesting, and you see some of the storyboards for the stampede, earthquake, and bats. Seeing storyboards are quite interesting, although the drawings of the animals does get kind of tedious flicking through them.
It's still strange seeing Kirsten Dunst so young, yet she's only 2 years older than me, and has done so much with her life. She must look back on this film and cringe - she does look a bit daft at times.
Interesting fact for all you Disney fans out there: Bradley Pierce (Peter) was the voice of Chip in Beauty & The Beast! I didn't know that until I read his profile on the DVD.

Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow.  No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals.  There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.
Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film.  Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles.  Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale.  An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.

775937,5,6304030959,"In 1989 Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID initiated a significant renaissance of family films of both the animated and live action variety. There were actually quite a few live action family films produced up through the mid 90s that combined outrageous situations, sentimental plotting and good doses of visual mayhem to entertain most audiences. Some of these films such as HOME ALONE (1990), BEETHOVEN (1992), HOMEWARD BOUND: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1993) and DENNIS THE MENACE (1993) were the staples of this renaissance. By the mid 90s the appeal of such films seemed to be waning. 1995's JUMANJI seemed to be one of the last of the films to gain recognition and prominence at least to the audiences that went to see it. Many of the noted critics at that time were not exactly enthralled with this film. I sat in the theatre thinking that this was one of the most innovative films to come along for some time. It not only contained those elements that characterized the aforementioned family films but also combined convincing digital effects, real drama, danger and concluded with an important message the parents and children should take the time to notice one another and not create impenetrable boundaries around themselves. A boy most grow into manhood before he understands that perhaps his father does not know how to approach him. JUMANJI is filled with action and many special effects that really are elements of the catharsis that Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) must endure before he can ever possibly go home again. Watching this film again recently I was touched by the scene where Robin Williams visits the old family shoe business to find the factory empty and closed down now a home for a transient who barely remembers the fate of Williams' dad. That scene counterbalanced with the score that James Horner had composed of the earlier New England setting was bittersweet. Watching that scene I also drifted back to the time when this film was first released. They really don't make films like this any more. Those were the good old days. And it's really not that long ago. For a while the studios were making intelligent films for the whole family that weren't afraid to make you feel for the characters as well as laugh with them.

The computer-generated effects all wreak havoc through quiet streets, and while most of this is pretty fun, relationship conflicts and character development are weak and forgettable.

The movie begins in the 1860's when two kids bury some locked chest.  Then, a boy discovers it on a construction site and pulls it out, discovering a board game inside called Jumanji.  He gets a girl to play with him and he is sucked into the board, reappearing like 20 years later, saying and looking like he had been living in a jungle most of his life.  Unfortunately, with him also came undesirable things from Jumanji, such as monkeys taking over the town, stampeding elephants, disease, spiders the size of basketballs, and the like.  To end it all, they must finish the game, which means it's going to get worse before it gets better.  They end up finishing it alive (barely) and then they are back in time as kids right before he got sucked into the board.  So the two keep the secret to themselves since no one is aware anything happened and they'd never believe them anyway.  They also get married.  Awww, how cute.  So they rid themselves of the damned game of course but stupidly just set it in a creek to float away, instead of burning it (duh!).  So then in Japan or somewhere on the beach, two kids hear the African drumming coming out of the board ahead and they rush towards it in curiosity and delight at their finding.  Oh boy!  Maybe this means there will be sequel!  Then, we can learn where this game came from and how and why it does what it does.",1025913600,4,1615,4.390572390572391

This movie is a fantastic fantasy/action movie.  It starts out well, and the suspense continues to build until the climax.  At the same time, it's got some great one-liners and funny scenes to break the tension.  The entire cast does well with the material, including all the special effects.  The special effects show their age today and are a bit more stylized then realistic, but they serve the movie well.
A word of warning to parents.  This is a very intense movie.  Even though it was marketed as a family movie, many small kids will be frightened by it.  Keeping that in mind, you might want to preview it before you show it to them.
This DVD is a perfect showcase for the movie.  The picture is sharp, and the surround sound puts you right in the middle of the action.

I could argue that it has something to say about perseverance and not letting others down, but it does seem to be more about punch lines, things coming through walls, floors, ceilings, etc., and special effects, than anything else. That isn't necessarily bad, though. Some movies should just be fun, and ""Jumanji"" does that pretty well. Yes, the premise is preposterous. A game where each space you land on has a rhyme that produces tangible (and violent) results. But it's no more preposterous than a boy who hears dead people (""Sixth Sense"" for those who missed it). Bottom line: in my opinion this flick was a lot of fun. Not deep, but fun. It has all the laughs and action you could want. And my kids like it, too (no, it didn't scare them).

The only mystical quality comes from the discovery of the game itself.  The movie pays little attention to the origin of the game.  Instead, the characters inadvertantly jump right into the game.  This part of the movie, the part with all the visuals, is entertaining to watch but requires you to keep your mind at bay.  The story is full of holes, mostly the fact that instead of rushing through the game, they stop and wait to see what happens after each turn (Why?).

When Alan rolls the dice, he gets sucked into the board game's jungle and has to stay there until somebody rolls a five or an eight. The girl Sarah gets chased away by a bunch of bats who appeared when she rolled the dice.
Now, twenty-six years late, another boy, Peter (Bradley Pierce), and his sister, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), move into the same house that the boy Alan Parish lived in. They find the board game one morning in the house and begin to play it. To make all the animals and jungle plants go away, they have to finish the board game.

The writing is creative,  imaginative and compelling. The effects range from great (stampede, vines)  to weak (spiders, monkey faces), but they don't get in the way of an  engaging, fast-paced, even provocative movie.
The psychology may seem pop  Freudian to some, but it serves the overall illusion created by the movie.  I suspect that on a psychological level, ""Jumanji"" functions to  let kids deal with the anger and estrangement they feel with their fathers  (a la Bruno Bettelheim's ""The Uses of Enchantment"").
Carl, the  African American shoe designer/police officer, provides some of the  funniest material; unfortunately it smacks of an earlier cinema tradition  in which the black faces were always the victims of gags that exploited  their supposed fears or ignorance.

776122,1,6304030959,"Chris Van Allsburg's brisk, haunting storybook is turned into yet another Robin Williams vehicle about getting in touch with your feelings. Williams stars as Alan, a guy trapped for 26 years in the magical board game  Jumanji. When orphans Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce find the game and  roll the dice, they release Alan as well as various marauding beasts that  flatten the sleepy suburbs. The movie gives Alan a cold father who comes  back to haunt him in the form of a psychotic game hunter (both are played  by Jonathan Hyde). The hunter, one can't help noticing, has a big gun.  Freudians should have a field day with the movie: It's crammed with  phallic/vaginal threats, plus constant images of cathartic violation. The  animals, demolishing suburban propriety, are primal therapists.
Bonnie  Hunt turns up as Alan's now-grown-up childhood sweetheart, who must spell  out the movie's subtext: The stampeding beasts, and Jumanji itself, are  manifestations of Alan's repressed anger at Dad. Why spend $65 million and  thousands of hours sweating over computers to make a banal fable about the  hazards of bottling up your anger? The animals do put on a show, but some  of them -- particularly the lion and the monkeys, the ones with the most  articulation in their features -- look jerky and plasticized. In format,  ""Jumanji"" is a mild retread of ""Jurassic Park"" (the  director, Joe Johnston, is supposed to direct the third ""JP""),  complete with the nuclear family of the guy, the woman, and the two  parentless kids who all come together while fighting or fleeing from  computer-generated critters. It was said to be too scary for kids, but the  scariest thing about it is that it took three guys to write a screenplay  this repetitive and psychologically glib.",964915200,6,1774,4.982935153583618
776123,4,6304030959,"This movie has a great idea. And it's fun!  Although it's rediculous, but I saw it 2 times. My complaint is that the trials seem to be more and more trite and unexciting. I love the first some surprises, such us bat, bug,  and eat-flowers. But the tramples of the elephants, the shooter, the flood  seems to be predictable. BTW, The ending of this movie is so bad, I dislike  it so!  A cliche!",956793600,,393,4.256756756756757
776124,5,6304030959,"This is a film I enjoyed even though it made me recall some of the conflicts I had with MY father as I was growing up.  I feel this is a good movie for saturday nights; a bit scarry but lots of fun.  I'm not sure young kids would trust their board games again, but aside from that, I  think it is fun for the whole family.  Williams and the others of the cast  are excellent and don't over play their roles.  I certainly enjoyed it in  the theater and continue to enjoy it as a video.",956361600,,484,3.9278350515463916
776125,4,6304030959,"Screen favorite Robin Williams (Mrs. Doubtfire) faces bigger-than-life jungle dangers in the entertaining 1995 fantasy adventure ""Jumanji"". In 1969, young Alan Parrish finds a mysterious jungle-themed board game and is magically vanished to the incredible jungle world of Jumanji. 26 years later, two unsuspected children (Kirsten Dunst & Bradley Pierce) freed the now adult Alan Parrish (Williams) and unleash the rampaging beasts and fierce dangers of Jumanji upon their quiet New England town. Based on the best-selling children's book, ""Jumanji"" is an exciting fast-paced fantasy adventure for the whole family. Director Joe Johnston effectively combines elements of adventure, fantasy and humor for an enchanting movie spectacle. Its clever storyline and appealing characters are certainly amusing. The blockbuster fantasy adventure contains some great special effects and thrilling moments but a few visual effects weren't quite polished. The cast also includes Bonnie Hunt, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and David Alan Grier.

""Jumanji"" Collector Edition is a vast improvement over the previous bare-bones edition. The 1995 smash hit is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has an impressive video transfer with great sharpness and nice detailed colors. Its clear Dolby Digital 5.1 sound delivers some dynamic surround effects. The Collector Series DVD features the 20-minute ""Making of Jumanji"" documentary and ""Lion and Tigers and Pods, Oh My"" and ""Bringing Down the House"" featurettes that take a behind-the-scenes look at special effects and production of the film. Other DVD extras include three storyboards, photo galleries, theatrical trailers and an informative audio commentary with FX supervisor Ken Ralston. The interactive menus look pretty good. Overall, ""Jumanji"" Collector's Series earns a ""B"".",954633600,4,1836,5.850746268656716
