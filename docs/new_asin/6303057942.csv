548164,3,6303057942,"The movie is not a total disgrace to the Addam's Family genre (like Addam's Family Reunoin) but not at all as good as the first. The story  starts out wickedly funny as Grandma Addams, Wendsday, & Pugsley bury a  live cat but then drops from there. There are many laugh out loud scene's  but not at all as funny & dark as the first. The story starts out when  Mortisha (Angelica Houston) has a baby boy, when Wendsday & Pugsley  continuously try to kill the baby, Gomez & Mortisha decide to hire a  nanny.
The nanny who is played by Joan Cusack is actually a murderer  called a black widow by police, she investigates rich men, seduces them,  then kills them on the wedding night, and dissapears during the funeral. In  coming to the Addams' she seduces Uncle Fester & sends Wendsday &  Pugsley to summer camp.  Some of the most funny scenes are when Mortisha is  reading her baby ""The Cat in the Hat"" & many of the summer  camp scenes. And the only part of the movie that might have bousted the  rating is the tango scene.",966124800,,1023,4.343915343915344
548165,5,6303057942,"I am a fan of movies that can be watched for fun again and again. I find both Addams family movies (with this same cast) up there with my favorite  fun movies (Princess Bride, Ferris Bueller) and they are always there to  bring a smile to a boring day.
Morticia and Gomez are played very well.  Gomez is still contagiously energetic and Morticia continues to add her  dark comedy that just seem to emit from her character without words.  Christina Ricci, slightly older than in the first movie, just completely  exemplifies Wednesday basically stealing the show.  Pugsly is Pugsly.  Not  a standout, but perfectly played.  I am also a huge Christopher Lloyd fan  and seeing him again as Fester was wonderful. Carol Kane should have been  Grandma in the first movie because she adds the finishing touches to an  overall perfect cast.
This is a delightful movie that just keeps you  smiling and I highly recommend it for those boring days when you just are  in the mood for a ""fun"" movie.  Get the first one too and watch  that one too.  When it's over you'll want more and wish there was an  adequate sequel.",965347200,3,1107,4.584615384615384
548166,5,6303057942,"As A large fan of the original TV series. I feel I can say this film is worthy. Alas without Raul Julia there can not be a third. He was a wonderful Gomez. [I still deny the existance of Roger Moore as 007 too BTW]  Angelica Huston was a perfect Morticia too. The tango scene was to die for.  [Daryl Hanna ? WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING !] Chris Lloyd was a great  Fester. Pugsly was Pugsly what can you say ? Same for Lurch and Thing. Joan  Cusak was perfect. Hmmmm ?  Who else ?  KIDDING ! Christina Ricci ! O  Yessss ! an absolute delight. Totally Wednesday. If she wasn't such a total  babe I would regret she had to grow up. Delightful evil child. Just  wonderfly cast, written, acted and directed.",943228800,7,707,4.177777777777778
548167,5,6303057942,"OK--here's the deal. the movie operates at about this level:
Wednesday and Pugsley have ben trying to kill each other because of the new baby.  They believe that when a new baby comes in, one of the extant kids has to  go.  And I mean: ""GO.""  These attempts get everyone's attentions,  so a family meeting happens.
Grandma Addams:  Why are you trying to kill  each other?
W and P look furtively at each other, but they say  nothing.
GA:  Well, why are you doing it?
W and P still furtive.
GA:  Is it because you believe that if a new baby comes in, we have to get rid  of one of you?
W and P guiltily look at each other, then start to nod,  tentatively.
GA:  No!  Oh no!  That's..not..true!!  That's just not true.  Any more.
Me?  I saw it on a plane and almots fell off my seat.  Maybe  I'm just simple, but I thought it was hilarious.  And I'm not a big Addams  family fan.",941414400,3,875,4.11377245508982

548281,5,6303057942,"This was (no exaggeration) a heart-warming film about difference, inclusion, and the true love of family, which eclipses wealth, privilege, whiteness, and respectability. Too bad the only Black character was Jamal, one of the outcasts at the white supremacist WASP summer camp. Not enough sex scenes. Wednesday and her handsome young Jewish boyfriend were particularly compelling. I would watch a sequel.",1507680000,,404,5.639344262295082

Born with a full pencil mustache.  And the arrival of a lady who wants to kill everybody for the money.  Joan Cusack has one of her best roles with that.,1472860800,,452,3.977777777777778

549882,5,6303057942,"While recently doing a production of ""The Addams Family: The Musical"", I mainly used this movie and the original New Yorker cartoons as reference for my character (Gomez) study, and I found that this movie, apart from being much more superior to it's predecessor, is the truest expression of Addams' work. The first movie mirrored the goofy tone of the 60's TV series, with elements such as the Addams living in a suburban neighboorhood, their house being something like a museum/gallery of antiques and strange artifacts, and the type of comedy used. Plus, the movie doesn't seem to have a fully developed story, just a couple of jokes tossed around and grouped into a linear plot that could easily have been produced as an episode of the originaltv show. I felt as if I were watching a Halloween TV movie.

This sequel, however, is a whole different story. From the beginning the family is already full fledged and every member well developed (the opening sequence depicts a normal night in the Addams household to near perfection), the movie is a whole lot more stunning visually (it actually looks like the cartoons brought to three dimensional life right to the tiniest detail), and more importantly, it actually has a plot, and a very good one at that, with the comedy echoing the dark humor that Addams used to put in his works.

The movie is very well acted to. Raul Julia and Angelica Huston are perfect as Gomez and Morticia, Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Uncle Fester, Christina Ricci steals the show, as always, as Wednesday, and the villainess, a murderous nanny named Debbie, is superbly portrayed by Joan Cusack. Lurch (Carel Struycken), Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Thing (Christopher Hart) are also great. Grandmama, this time around played by Carol Kane, does a far better job than Judith Malina in the first film by portraying her as a witch, who is a loving and caring granny just as much as a psychotic hag who enjoys spending her time brewing potions and cursing anyone who threatens her family.

What this film does best than any other incarnantion (aside from the Broadway musical which masterfully goes in the exact same direction) is going back to the characters roots. The Addamses are not your typical creepy, goofy family from next door (we have the Munster for that, luckily enough). They are aristocrats: eccentric, bizzar, passionate about all things macabre. They are the type of people whose home you would stumble upon by loosing your way in a deserted, country road in the dead of night, and still they would welcome you into their gloomy abode with a friendly (albeit creepy) smile and and a warm bed to spend the night (be cautious, though, it could be filled with spikes). This dark humor is exactly the sort of thing Charles Addams strived for with his cartoons, and luckily for us moviebuffs who are fans of his work, Addams Family Values exists in our lives... and afterlives.",1471392000,2,2921,4.826347305389222

In Values we have a nanny who is actually a greedy murderer trying to get rid of the family in order to inherit everything herself.  The one bit of novelty offered to this flick was the introduction of infant Pubert, an exact replica of Gomez - mustache included.

550352,4,6303057942,"Our family really loves this movie but I am giving it four stars because it is definitely not for everyone. Like most PG-13 movies there is some violence in ""Adams Family Values"" but what distinguishes this movie from many films with this rating is its dark humor, its references to sex and its lefty politics. The movie's preferences for dark and sexual humor are established in its early scenes. ""A.F.V."" opens with the Adams Family children and their grandmother conducting a solemn funeral for a cat. Typical childhood scene, right? Except this cat is still meowing and scratching at its coffin/shoe box and the children are preparing to bury it alive (the little girl in particular is annoyed with the cat as she tries to quiet its noises). Later, the Adams children sit in a hospital waiting room anticipating the birth of a sibling. Another child tells an elaborate fairytale (with ""a stork"" and a""diamonds"", etc.) meant to explain where babies come from to which the Adams girl replies ""Our parents had sex."" Finally, the movie mocks the faults of upper-middle class whites: their exclusion of other ethnicities and of people who do not conform to certain aesthetic and behavioral ideals.. The movie even asserts that the Indians should have killed the Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving. So, again, hilarious but not to everyone's taste.",1441152000,,1346,4.986666666666666

552012,4,6303057942,"Movies this gleefully outrageous just don't get made anymore. The second of Barry Sonnenfeld's Addams movies isn't as tight as the first, but it still serves up plenty of ghoulish fun. Much as I'll always love the '60s TV show, this cast is the definitive Addams family for me. They're creepy and kooky and often outlandishly inappropriate, but never mean-spirited. Most of the incidents of the film point out the appropriateness of its title - the Addamses, as seemingly perverse as they are, are a much more supportive and loving family than most ""normal"" people.

Unfortunately, a message like that is just a little too dangerous for studios to handle now. These days, the suits would probably never even let a sequence like Wednesday and her cronies burning down the camp musical's set be shot, let alone released; and watchdog groups would be all over social media before it even hit theatres to nitpick every single element that isn't blandly wholesome and inoffensive. Fortunately, we can still turn back to movies like this that dared to take some risks, and turned out to be wildly entertaining.

The HD presentation of Addams Family Values looks very good, though it does reveal some of the rough edges of the filmmaking process - makeup lines on actors' faces and the Dracula-like key lighting on Morticia's face show up a little too clearly now. But the result is still a non-stop laugh machine.",1414972800,,1407,4.882845188284519

552675,4,6303057942,"""Addams Family Values"" (1993) was the second of two films in the early 90s based on the 60's TV show. The story this time is that a charismatic-but-fake woman gets hired by the Addams as a baby sitter, but she's really a gold-digging ""black widow"" who's after Uncle Fester's fortune. She convinces Morticia and Gomez (Angelica Huston and Raul Julia) that the older kids -- Wednesday and Pugsley  should go to summer camp so she can be free to put her spell on Lester.

This is a good movie if you're in the mood for campy entertainment mixed with black humor and amusing one-liners. The appeal of the Addams family is that they're the express opposite of any remotely normal family. Most of the time the filmmakers keep the Addams on the amusingly-odd-and-eccentric side of things  stopping just short of satanism  but sometimes they go too far and the joke's not funny, like when the kids and Granny try to bury their cat who's obviously still alive. I own cats and love 'em so this type of joke strikes me as sick, not funny; after all, what's funny about hurting innocent creatures? The kids' attempts to kill the new infant, by contrast, work better because they give away the kids' jealousy and their desire for their parents' love & attention, which they would never openly admit, of course, particularly Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and her ultra-emotionless disposition.

Christopher Lloyd is great as Lester and Joan Cusack shines as the black widow. Seriously, Joan  despite her character's unlikable OTT deviousness -- is the definition of voluptuous beauty throughout; a stunning whoa-man and pleasure to behold. The summer camp scenes with Wednesday and Pugsley are also a highlight.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Palos Verdes Peninsula (the Addams mansion), Pasadena and Camp Tulequoia, Sequoia Lake, Sequoia National Forest, California.

For me, Addams Family Values is that movie.

It captures the sardonic wit of the original cartoon strips, with plenty of visual cues and deadpan one-liners that brighten my day.  The film understands that it is over the top and the cast seems to revel in creating huge characters that seem to inflate even further as the scenes go along.

553640,5,6303057942,"I've seen the old seventies Addams Family. I've seen the remake/movie that precedes this one, and I am a big fan. I can relate to the Addams' because sometimes I think my own family is just like them, lol. But the sequel to The Addams Family is really funny. I especially liked Christina Ricci in this one as the character Wednesday Addams. Even as young as she was in this remake, she really shows some of her best acting skills. In this comedy, the Gothic Misfits have a hard time when Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) falls in love with a nanny that turns out to be a kind of Black Widow serial killer that murders her husband's for their money, and the Addams Family fortune is at stake as she draws Fester into her web. Wednesday Addams is way too smart for her own good and The Nanny manipulates the children to be sent away, off to ""Camp Chipawa"" a children's summer camp for the privileged. While the Addams children are being tortured in the happy house where they show endless Disney movies, The Black Widow Nanny is free to weave her web....absolutely a movie for the library!",1384214400,,1087,4.494949494949495

553973,4,6303057942,"""The Addams Family Values"" is a sequel to the 1991 movie ""The Addams Family"". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, and lets us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts.

Overall, ""The Addams Family Values"" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.",1370995200,,1193,4.848039215686274

554039,3,6303057942,"There is a new addition to the Addams Family: Pubert, a darling little dark-haired baby with a mustache just like his daddy's. This bundle of fire-breathing joy have made his parents very proud... and his siblings sincerely jealous. Wednesday (Ricci) has convinced her brother Pugsley (Workman) that whenever a new child comes into the family, one of the older children must die -- a practice that is no longer in use. Their mother Morticia (Huston) is slightly disconcerted that caring for the baby leaves no time for her to pursue hellish activities, and so her husband Gomez (Julia) arranges to have a nanny brought in.

The first three don't last more than an hour. Then the doorbell rings and a winning, cleavage-bearing blonde enters their morbid existence and immediately wins over the shy heart of Uncle Fester (Lloyd). Little do the Addams Family know that Debbie (Joan Cusack) is a notorious serial killer with a long succession of marrying men for their fortune and then abruptly ending their life on the wedding night. She manages to prevent the children from murdering Pubert on numerous occasions but when Wednesday becomes suspicious of her true intentions, manipulates their parents into sending them off to summer camp. The well-lit, wooded place of ""fun and learning"" is a nightmare for two brooding, pale children dressed entirely in black, and they conspire to make camp a living hell for its happier occupants while their parents are conflicted by Fester's marriage to Debbie and subsequent shunning of them.

What Debbie forgot is that Addams Family members don't die the first time around. Or the second. Or even the third. What she winds up with is increasing frustration and a very much alive husband! What results is two hours of excessively morbid humor in the tradition of the first film, only this one is a lot more fun. The characters have all gotten to the point where nothing surprises us so much as it delights us, and having mustached little Pubert in the background (including when he becomes ill and sprouts lovely golden locks, much to the suicidal dismay of his parents) only increases the experience. We encounter a little bit of Wednesday's romantic side, revealing that yes, one she may live up to her mother's potential. Everything is very tongue in cheek and meant to inspire laughs, and for the most part there are no serious spiritual issues to contend with. ""Grandma"" is something of a witch, but aside from handing Debbie a skull and informing her that there's a curse on it, she remains in the background.

More prevalent is the dark humor, which involves numerous attempts by the Addams children to dispatch their baby brother. They try throwing him off the top of the house (his dad happens to open a window and catch him). They place him into a mini guillotine (Pubert stops the blade). They try dropping a cannon ball on him (it misses). Once at summer camp, after being punished for their gloom through the torture of watching musicals and Disney movies all day long, the children turn malicious, setting fire to out buildings, threatening to scalp a girl, and sassing their elders. A woman is electrocuted and turns to dust. There are numerous sly references to torture during lovemaking. When confronted with a wild story of how babies grow in cabbage patches by a kid in the hospital, Wednesday says bluntly that all her parents did was have sex. Debbie makes a big deal out of being a virgin, and has a couple of conversations with Fester about it.

When her attempt to murder him on the honeymoon fails, she's forced to spend the night with him. She climbs on top of him in bed, then proceeds to blackmail him -- he cannot see his family if he intends to sleep with her on a regular basis. She uses this ""sexual blackmail"" on later occasions.

THE ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES plays up all of the same great humor from the original, providing consistent laughs and more deliriously entertaining performances from the entire cast. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are at their best, as always. By tossing the two Addams children into a summer camp filled with white bred teen socialites, director Barry Sonnenfeld has given Christina Ricci many more opportunities to shine in her fiendish portrayal of Wednesday Addams. Joan Cusack joins the cast as Debbie, the ""Black Widow,"" as well, adding her own over-the-top antics to the bunch. THE ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES comes as close as possible to topping the original in a worthy sequel that fans are sure to enjoy!

554046,2,6303057942,"Odd. This movie is both much less dark and much more campy than its predecessor, making it more kid-friendly, but at the same time, there some elements that are less suitable for kids--the various comments about sex and ""physical pleasure, and the conceit of Fester being held captive by a woman's cleavage. I loved the delicious, dark passion of Gomez and Morticia in the last movie; it was moving and funny but not campy.

The acting, the situations, the plot line of this movie: trite. Suitable only for the very young. The element of sex and sexuality: totally unsuitable for the very young. To whom is this movie trying to appeal?

I adored ""The Addams Family"" and had hoped this movie would be in the same vein. Alas, it was not. In very few scenes are actors Julia and Huston allowed to shine; even Ricci is shackled by the ho-hum characterization of Wednesday. I fear that ""Addams Family Values"" was made to appeal to a broader audience, but it was dumbed down and oddly bipolar (campy, trite children's jokes + overt and adult jokes about sex).

This movie, ""Addams Family Values,"" was a disappointment to me and mostly a waste of time. But I will watch ""The Addams Family"" many, many times again.",1357430400,2,1206,4.652582159624413

554096,4,6303057942,"In reality, this is a four-star movie compared to other cooky comedies like Airplane, Beetlejuice, etc.  I enjoyed it almost as much as the first installment!  Angelica Huston is altogether underrated for her performance because she is divine as Mortisha.  Raul Julia is obviously perfect as well, but I don't see Angelica getting enough credit!  Needless to say, for me, the chemistry between Raul & Angelica MAKE these two movies (first and second).  Sadly, they are not in more scenes in the second film.

Great performances from the whole cast and lots of chuckle-worthy moments.  Ricci is also great at showing more range in this than the previous film and making her ""romance"" chemistry work without being able to rely on the usual teenage crush body language.  Joan Cusack did a great job although it gets a little old after a while.  A very enjoyable and fun watch (if you just want to relax and go for a ride)!  I especially love the very last 2 scenes, but I won't give it away!

My only gripe is that Fester actor Christopher Lloyd was WAY over the top!  Too much overacting and pulling faces and he is just grating to watch and made me wince constantly.  I don't think he resembles the original Fester at all and he doesn't understand the character.  Probably the worst acting of his life.  Otherwise, great movie! :-D

**I also think it's unfair to compare it to the original show because (a.) The memory of anything you loved as a kid can't compare with ANY version of it now because you have inextricably romanticized it and (b.) the film is supposed to be a re-boot of the series.

554144,3,6303057942,"After the Addams family settles down with Fester (Christopher Lloyd) back in the clan, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) find out they're expecting. After the baby arrives, Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) try to kill the baby leaving Morticia and Gomez with no other choice but to find a nanny (Joan Cusack). But the nanny has bigger plans for Fester, which include Wednesday and Pugsley going to summer camp to get them out of the way.

With a movie originally planned to be directed by Tim Burton, Barry Sonnenfeld did a surprisingly amazing job. No one actually expected it to do as well as it did, but it did so well that it warranted a sequel. While The Addams Family always looked good on paper in it's original Charles Addams conjecture, making a movie out of it with a first, third, and second act was not easy to do. Making a sequel to it would be even harder than making an original movie from the comic strip come TV series. So how did they do at making a sequel to the original Addams Family movie?

On the plus side most of the original players are back to have a little fun with the Addams Family name. While I thoroughly enjoyed Grandmama (Judith Malina) from the first movie, in the second movie Taxi vet Carol Kane takes her place taking the role in a much more comedic direction than just a dark direction. On top of that, Raul Julia does an amazing job reprising his role as Gomez for the sequel, in what will become his last great major screen role (I, as well as many others, are trying to forget Street Fighter when I say this). All in all, Addams Family Values carries a bit more of a comedic tone than a darkly comedic tone this time around than the first installment.

Christina Ricci really rules the roost this time around. While the first film was mainly about Fester and his journey to redemption (in a very Addams way), but this time it's more about Wednesday surviving something of a summer boot camp. Most of the players this time around are really just incidental, including Joan Cusack (who does do an amazing job as Fester's finace with much bigger intentions), Peter MacNicol, and Christine Baranski. Ricci, for a young, and inexperienced actress for the most part, does a great job of showing up the adults and playing a character that appears to go from dark to sweet and back again.

More so than it's predecessor, I seriously have to say that this movie has it's flaws. While in the first movie, Fester was endearing, in this movie he's way too over the top. I love Christopher Lloyd, but he really needed to tone it down in this movie. On top of that, the writers seemed to be on a mission to place the characters in awkward positions. While this might have worked in the first film to a certain extent, placing all the characters in awkward positions throughout the second film is just a little too much for one film to completely sustain. It really wears on you after too long.

The Addams Family was enough, in my opinion, the sequel didn't need to happen, and, unfortunately there are even moments when it seems they've run out of ideas (the dance between Gomez and Morticia is fun, but seems almost like a ripoff of the Mamushka dance from the movie before it). If you watch it, watch it for Ricci's brilliant performance and for Raul Julia's last great performance in a role he was born for. My only wish is that it was better, or should I say half as good as it's predecessor.

554145,4,6303057942,"Being perfectly honest, I liked the original series of the 60s. But I didn't like the 1st movie AT ALL.

This 2nd movie was in my opinion a great improvement over the 1st. After the turmoil of Fester's questionable role in part 1, order seems to have been restored, and he is a full fledged Addams now. The movie begins with Morticia giving birth to a new child. Wednesday and Puglsey are of course jealous, and as a result, Gomez and Morticia hire a nanny.

In an interesting and somewhat plausible twist, this nanny has the goal of wooing Fester and then bumping him off for the family fortune. But of course, the Addamses have ways of walking out of what would kill the average person, so this makes it all the more darkly funny. (And with Fester's naive nature, we don't know whether to laugh or pity him.) The original Fester may have decided to: ""Just shoot her in the back.""

It is interesting that in the movie, we see the hypocrisy of hiding evil in what appears to be normal. (Especially at the summer camp.) How Thanksgiving began as the exploitation of the Native American Indians; having our favorites in a group and making everyone else feel worthless and unwanted; using artificial 'sweetness' to avoid fact and reality; etc.

Overall, the plots and subplots fit together rather well. In a dark, but still touching scenario, Wednesday finds a possible match. (Someone who oddly and by sheer coincidence looks like a young Harry Potter.)

What makes this movie so interesting is like the series, we start by thinking the Addams family is strange. But then we see the cruelty and evils in the 'conventional' characters. To say nothing of hypocrisy.

Without going on for too long, there are some real signature scenes such as the dance between Gomez and Morticia at the restaurant. The wedding is also well done.

My one small complaint is that I wish Lurch could have said (even if just once) his famous line: ""You rang?""

She charms the family, especially Uncle Fester, who is head-over-heels for her. However, Wednesday and Pugsley see through her sensual facade: Debbie is only after Fester for his money. Before they can rat on her, she has the kids sent off to summer camp, as she and Fester get married. While she tries (several times) to kill Fester and make it look like an accident, Pugsley and Wednesday must battle ever-cheery camp directors and spoiled rich kids to get back to their family and warn them of Debbie's plans. ""Addams Family Values"" completely cracked me up. It is so immensely enjoyable and funny. This movie is filled with wonderful touches of black humour.

554147,3,6303057942,"What I found so charming in the first film was the flirtatious interplay between Gomez and Morticia.  I also fell in love with the set of the Addam's mansion exactly as it was....I felt that it was designed not to look like a haunted house, but a stately old manor that had simply been neglected to the point of disrepair.  The sequel focuses mainly on Pugsley and Wednesday with a heavy dose of Fester and his new bride.  Gomez and Morticia are pushed into the background to the point that they are rarely even seen.  I also did not care for the changes made to the set of the house.  It was altered to be quite dark and I felt somewhat over the top in its attempt to set the tone of the family atmosphere.

Ahhh...perhaps I am nitpicking, but the Addam's Family is one of my favorite ""brain break"" films and I find the sets total eye candy and the relationship between Morticia and Gomez a refreshing reminder that even a long marriage can still be flirty and fun!  The follow up is ok....but could have been better if they had retained the charm of the first film.",1257033600,,1067,4.331658291457287
554148,4,6303057942,"I'll admit that I never watched the television show.  I was more of a `Munsters' kid, and so really the only reason I had a desire to see this movie was because I feel that Joan Cusack deserves to be in like every movie (except `Arlington Road', but I've already expressed myself on that matter).  So, I decided to check out the first film before delving into this one, you know, to set myself up.  Well, twenty minutes into `The Addams Family' I actually turned it off.  It bored me and so I wasn't sure if I was going to even try this one.  I read a few reviews, all citing this to be better than the original, and so I said `why not' and rented it.

It's not brilliant, but it sure is funny...and Joan Cusack is a riot!

The film focuses in on a money hungry seductress named Debbie Jellinsky who poses as a nanny in order to get after Uncle Fester and his fortune.  Young Wednesday Addams seems to be the only one wise to this woman's evil scheme, so Debbie finds a way to get rid of her.  Taking care of Fester is harder than Debbie thought (her plan was to marry and then kill him, but he is not your typical husband) so her plans have to be altered slightly in order to get all that she wants out of the man.

The acting is what makes this movie so watchable, especially between Cusack and the brilliant Christina Ricci, who knows how to make Wednesday so eerily remarkable (and OMG the whole camp Thanksgiving play scene is just brilliant).  Really, Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia are obsolete when you consider the great supporting characters here.  Christopher Lloyd is every type of hilarious even amidst his every type of clich&eacute; as Fester, but it is Cusack who steals the show with her menacing creation.

Also, you won't soon forget the hilarious duo that is Christine Baranski and Peter MacNicol as two camp leaders trying desperately to reform young Wednesday Addams.

The jokes for the most part all seem to land very well, especially at the summer camp (where every scene is a hilarious delight), and the film has a nice flow to it.  I was a little shocked and the disinterest the film seemed to have with the two presumable leads, Morticia and Gomez, but there is so much to enjoy about the Wednesday and Debbie storylines that one does not miss the Addams family patriarchs.

So pull up and chair and pop the popcorn because this is a movie you'll find yourself really enjoying.  It could have been tweaked here or there but for the most part it is a delight, and I'm sure it is even more refreshing for those who actually watched the show.",1235347200,2,2566,4.414012738853503

Addams Family Values has to be watched a number of times to catch all the funny little phrases and one liners.  Brilliant writing combines with great characterizations to produce a movie to delight those who love dark humor.

Payback time at the camp was simply delicious.  As a child, I would have found a lot in common with Wednesday's attitude towards the whole camping experience, with its fake facade of peace, love and all that BS.  It brought back a lot of my own feelings as a youngster who was a bit out of the ordinary and often mocked because of it.  Go Wednesday!

Usually sequels fall short of the original, but this one, IMO, went beyond the first film for comedy and originality.  No fan of the Addams family, and especially Wednesday, should miss adding this gem to his/her DVD collection.

She delivers these lines with such a funny affect and vocal character,  you can't help but laugh.  The writing is just as important to Joan's performance as her talent.

Anjelica Huston is just serene and gothic enough to pull the character of ""Morticia"" off.  She is a great performer in this film.  She slinks across the stages with such fluidity.  The lighting design for ""Morticia"" is excellent as well.  Again,  as with Cusack,  the writing is just as important.

My rationale for subtracting a ""star"" is Christopher Lloyd.  His attempt to pull this character off the comic pages is tiring.  He attempts to take this ogre into a slapstick routine.  It doesn't work.  Were it not for Cusack's assistance,  this performance would have fallen as with the first film.

No. 2 though ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES was way better. I think that in the first outing the actors tried to potray their characters as they were portayed in the old TV shows. In the second however, they were more comfortable breathing their own life into these roles. Especially Christina Ricci, there was a whole lot more depth to her role as the beautiful Wednsday Addams, which in turn proved her abilities as a serious actress early on... by the way I was about ten years old when this came out, so it was ok for me to think that Wednsday Addams was hot. My love for Christina Ricci has matured along with her movies (when she did CASPER she was in sort of an awkward stage then, so was I, no biggie.. by the time Buffalo 66 came out she had blossomed QUITE nicely and has only gotten cuter with age) however, there was something about that Wednsday Addams... you just knew she was going to grow up to be a lot like her mother, Morticia. This is a wicked sexy role for Anjelica Huston by the way. She delivers a dead pan Morticia spot on. I love it. Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester is a central part of the plot in this, as he was in the first. This time around, he marries a wicked psyco chick, played by my baby's mother (just kidding- she is played by JOAN CUSACK, another love of mine) who plans on killing him to get to the Addams Family fortune. I can really relate to Uncle Fester in this one, when he is forced to move away from home and all that stuff.

The kids go to Summer camp, and lots of nutty stuff happens there. Lurch says ""awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" a couple of times, and Thing, It, and that freaky old lady are in the picture too. OH YEAH! And the baby. He's new.

The overall casting job these WB ADDAMS FAMILY movies couldn't be any better. Much like their version od DENNIS THE MENACE which was released that same year, high price actors mixed with some new talent and old familiar faces, but PERFECT in these movies, and their abilities to ensemble make these movies what they are.

The later WB straight to video sequels sucked, and the actors in those were piss poor. This is coming from someone who ALWAYS liked The ADDAMS FAMILY too. I'd reccomend just about everything, the old black and white show was GREAT, the old movies were good, the cartoon series were all great, and if you really want to go way back, look up some of the one panel comic strip collections of Charles Addams, those are a real good time too, the original stuff.

This one here though is one of my favorite rainy day movies, you should definately check it out.",1140998400,3,2757,4.345631067961165

554274,4,6303057942,"Having established the unique world of the Addams' in the first movie, the writers and producers go for more sight gags and cheap laughs in the sequel--not that there's anything wrong with that. After all, it's what the TV series did.

Especially when the cheap laughs are so good and plentiful--and as with Addams I, the women steal the show.

Morticia reading ""The Cat in the Hat"" to her baby is a priceless moment.  Wednesday forced to smile at summer camp; a mesmerising performance.

If you enjoy spotting stars in bit parts they did before they were famous, watch for Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as the hippie-chick nanny, Peter MacNichol (Ally McBeal) as the cheery camp counsellor, and Nathan Lane (The Producers) as the indifferent cop.

One quibble, and it's one which every Addams Family movie will face. It's very difficult to create a believable character for the villain, when all the villainous cliches have been co-opted by the good guys.  Poor Joan Cusack does her best.  But when the script calls for her to do the classic mad-scientist laugh, well...I can't help but think a real Addams would have been laughing along with her.  Besides, if her only crime is wanting to do in her husband, is not the Addams family graveyard full of admired relatives who did just that?  Hmmm...

Of course, the real villain of the piece is shallow, middle-class suburbia outside the Gate.  And luckily, Wednesday and Pugley vanquish this demon in the form of an excruciatingly cheerful summer camp. Watch he telling a ghost story...

In all, a good and very funny successor to the original.",1140307200,4,1597,4.809523809523809

The storylines here are fuller; none of that a Fester who isn't Fester is really Fester stuff that seemed too scripted.  Here, the 3 ongoing plots are more naturally-born from there characters:
Morticia and Gomez (Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia, the most perfect casting seen in film in some time) have just had a new baby.  Dealing with new parenthood is bad enough, but when your two older children are doing their best to do away with their new baby brother ... well, even though he's pretty capable of taking care of himself, Morticia and Gomez have their hands full;
Then there's Debbie, played BRILLIANTLY by the underrated Joan Cusack, who comes to help with the children but instead is a notorious Black Widow-style murderess bent on marrying Fester and getting her hands on the Addams's fortune.  Part of her plan in doing so is to get rid of the two older children, Pugsley and Wednesday, by sending them to a summer camp;
Pugsley and Wednesday are horrified by the cheery atmosphere at camp -- not to mention the caffeinated perkiness of the camp counselors, who are at times both revolted and ticked off by the 'weirdness' of the Addams kids.
All plotlines come together in a hilarious ending that remains true to the characters, and seems to come naturally from the story.
Christina Ricci (another of Hollywood's great underrated performers), as Wednesday Addams, again steals every scene she's in with ease -- her deadpan playing of Wednesday could not be more perfect.  Watch for the segment where Wednesday and Pugsley perform their little scene from a play at camp; you'll wet your pants laughing!  Joan Cusack is, again, brilliant in her portrayal of Debbie, the killer with a heart of stone.
In fact, the whole cast works perfectly together for this superior sequel, with enough one-liners and sight gags and twisted humor to keep you laughing from beginning to end.  I didn't own either movie on DVD when I saw the first one on tv the other night (though had seen them both in theaters), but have since bought both ... though got this one first.  So gather with your shawl on, find a roost that you can crawl on, and catch this great comedy -- a must-see for anyone in need of some good belly laughs!",1081987200,18,2456,4.645161290322581

They know how to act in a dark comedy like this, where a mother might have to take away the knife her daughter is chasing the younger brother around with. And hand her an axe in replacement.
The movie has about three sub-plots. The first involves Morticia and Gomez, the parents, who just had a baby and are having to deal with all three of their children at once ( Wednesday and Pugsley, the children, are infatuated with disposing of the infant ).
While the children are plotting away, a nanny is hired. Her name is Debbie, played very well by Joan Cusack. Unbeknownst to the family, she is a criminal who marries rich men and then kills them, earning her a famous black-widow reputation. The second sub-plot involves her advances towards a relationship with Uncle Fester, one of the world's richest men.
The third sub-plot is Debbie's decision that Wednesday and Pugsley be sent to summer camp, which is basically the Addams's vision of Hell. Or Heaven. Whichever they like the least.

554484,4,6303057942,"In ""Addams Family Values,"" the jokes are funnier, the story is much more enjoyable, and the characters are more developed and easy to follow. The original cast is back for another round of gags and comedy, while the writers and director Barry Sonnenfield have chosen to stick with a story that works with the gags and laughs instead of just providing an outlet for them. This is one of the rare sequels that surpasses the original; I loved this movie!
The movie begins with the arrival of baby Pubert, in a hilarious send-up of birth scenes with a twist: the mother-to-be enjoys the labor pains. From this point on, the movie goes into three different stories which lead into one another. One dives into the children reacting to the new baby, doing everything from dropping him from the roof to placing him under the guillotine. Their antics are relentless, which leads into the second story as Gomez and Morticia decide to hire a nanny, picking the good-natured Debbie Jilinsky to care for their infant son. Fester falls head over heels in love with the new nanny, who is actually a murderess out for his wealth and fortune.
Debbie's suspicions that Wednesday and Pugsley know too much leads into the third story, as she has them shipped off to summer camp, where the sun and cheery attitudes of the campers and counselors are enough to make even the audience cringe in fear. As Debbie carries out her devious plans, the children are put through the hells of the camp until they can take it no longer, rounding out the movie's comedic climax with laughs galore.
Like the previous film, the original cast remains intact, with the exception of Grandmother Addams. Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston reprise the roles of Gomez and Morticia, whose romance is put on a back burner from its vivacity in the first film, allowing most of the story to rest on the shoulders of Wednesday and Pugsley, once again played by Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman. There is a lot more to their characters as they make their way through the treacheries of camp: Wednesday has matured into a much fuller character, while Pugsley remains childlike and naive. Fester, played by Christopher Lloyd, is shown as a hopeless romantic who honestly thinks his appearance has nothing to do with his inability to attain a female partner, while Debbie is played excellently by Joan Cusack, who knack for comedy and colorful phrases make her a uniquely comedic villain.
The contrasts abide within the story of Fester and Debbie and the trysts at summer camp. Fester's unconventional ways become trying for Debbie to live with; try as she might, she's still a ""normal"" human being. Wednesday and Pugsley's camp experience provides a sharp contrast: their refusal to take part in the events at camp bring the counselors, who are complete airheads that reminded me of the ditzy girls in high school, to the edge of losing it, but instead, they are forced into a place known as the Harmony Hut, where they are subjected to Disney films and Brady Bunch reruns.
In some ways, these contrasts could make the movie a social satire of sorts. The ways in which one character's lifestyle is compared to that of another are fascinating, and while the Addams are highly unconventional, the remaining characters from the real world are in no way considered normal. So the movie poses us that very question: ""Who's to say what is normal?""
That said, let's move on to the story, which is highly better than that of the original movie. This one actually produces the gags, having the feel that the story was written before the laughs were. The original had the feel that all the laughs were tossed into the air and placed in random spots, which would work because the gags never seemed attached to any specific storyline. Here, the comedy comes from the story, and the two work together marvelously at producing side-splitting laughs and subtle humor.
I couldn't help but enjoy myself while watching this movie. It made me laugh like I haven't laughed in a long time, while also keeping the characters intact and convincing.

As the potentially homicidal Wednsday Addams, Christina Ricci does a wonderful job in this film that took a very risky but ultimately profitable departure from conventional plots. Nestled within the confines of ghoulishness, she is comming of age at summer camp and even meets a young man who loves her for who she is.
Although he is not goth or as madcabre, the young man is sickly enough (Asthma and other illnesses) to satisfy young Wednsday's taste for romance. Intially uncertain about his intentions at first, it is obvious that she also likes him by the end of the movie.
Since I was not part of the in crowd at school, the summer camp scenes really stole my heart and I loved Wendsday's monolouge before she led the other ""unpopular"" kids in a good old fashioned ransacking. The overly chipper camp counselors get a good taste of their own medicine and viewing audiences are left to cheer.
Sure the sight of a baby with a moustache is so twisted, it is cute, but this was a case where the intended highlights of a sequel were foreshadowed by a continuing character's quest for self.
