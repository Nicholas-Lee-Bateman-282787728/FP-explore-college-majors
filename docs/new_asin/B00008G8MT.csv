7983425,5,B00008G8MT,"I hunted down this movie for quite some time, and when I saw it here on Amazon I snatched it up in a heartbeat.  Sure it wasn't a big budget film by any means, but regardless it's a fun one. Stephanie Kramer played the rolls well, and I'm just a sucker for classic 80's films of any kind ;)",1355529600,4,290,3.9152542372881354
