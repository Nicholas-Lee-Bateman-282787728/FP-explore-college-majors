3829624,4,B001Y44DKE,"Van der Valk is truly an absorbing and entertaining detective drama that featured the late talented actor Barry Foster (Alfred Hitchcock's, Frenzy) as Commissaris Piet Van Der Valk of the Amsterdam Police. With an catchy opening theme called ""Eye Level,"" the series was not only shot on location around quaint Amsterdam and its canals, but was filled with a number of engaging stories involving murder, kidnapping, blackmail, illicit drugs, and prostitution with many elite, high-profile suspects.

Those expecting a crime drama on the order of ""Mannix"" or the popular UK series ""The Professionals"" are likely to be disappointed. Van der Valk is a detective drama similar to the popular series ""Columbo"" here in the US or ""Bergerac"" in the UK. But unlike Peter Falk's exasperating detective from the LAPD, Foster's character has a certain appeal: a cynical and hardened yet sophisticated cop with a taste for fine wines, classical music, and quoting Baudelaire.

Supporting cast is also excellent with Susan Travers as Van der Valk's wife, Arlette, and Michael Latimer as Inspector Johnny Kroon, Van der Valk's rookie detective-in-training clearly recalling the chemistry between Karl Malden and Michael Douglas in the popular ""Streets of San Francisco.""  Fans of British television will also recognize other popular actors as guest stars such as Paul Eddington (Yes,Minister!) and Shane Briant (Hammer Films' ""Straight On Till Morning"").

The only disappointment with this set is that is is not the complete first season of 13 episodes--only the first six are included in this set. Like so many other classic television series on DVD, Acorn Media has decided to take a more profitable and expedient route by issuing only half of Season One.  Those with multi-regional dvd players that can play PAL-encoded discs can purchase the complete series collection of Van Der Valk on Network DVD from Amazon's UK site for around $50-$60 US dollars--perhaps a more cost effective alternative.",1254182400,16,1983,5.302547770700637

The entertainment was made by Thames Television for Britain's ITV (Independent Television stations); debuted in the U.K. in 1972, and ran for five seasons.  It was broadcast in the United States on PBS (Public Television stations) in the 1990s.  Set 1 is a 2 DVD box set that runs approximately 306 minutes; it includes all six episodes from Series 1 and an interview with the series' creator, Freeling.  Unfortunately, as the cast speaks in a mixture of accents, some Dutch, some English, and Foster in best cockney, playing his character as one of the lads, the production does not offer subtitles.

The series was shot largely on location in the charming old city of Amsterdam, all cobblestones and canals; however, neither the visual nor the sound quality is up to what we might expect today.  Production values are also lower than we might expect with a similar entertainment today - and there are no guest stars.  The dramas are gritty, and make full use of their setting, the peculiarities of the Dutch character, and their time.  Van Der Valk smokes like a chimney, drinks hard --doing both in the actual station house -- and is out and about, driving a police car after having had a few drinks, with, of course, no seat belts.  It's definitely the 1970's, grass cloth walls, caftans, KLM calendars wherever you look, all brown outfits: the real 1970s, not the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-on-Mars-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001XRLWLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life on Mars: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;1970s.

The catchy theme song by Dutchman Jack Trombey was commercially released as ""Eye Level:"" it became a Top 40 Hit, and sold millions of copies worldwide.  To my ear, it strongly echoes the music you could then hear in Amsterdam, played by organs in the streets: I actually visited that city twice in the late 60's, early 70's, during the years of my English exile,  and can still hear the notes.

Foster portrays Van Der Valk in a counter-intuitive way: he's not the character we would expect from the Dutch stereotypes we carry, such as phlegmatic, pragmatic: his policeman is excitable, free-wheeling, and rebellious.  The policeman has, in fact, been called a Dutch ""Columbo."" However, the author Freeling (born Nicolas Davidson in London, England in 1927), had Dutch-German blood through his mother, and lived most of his life in continental Europe, in France; he also frequently went to Amsterdam to research its goings on, so let's assume he knew what he was doing.  He published 37 books in all, and won the three most prestigious mystery writers awards, the Edgar of the Mystery Writers of America; the Gold Dagger of the Crime Writers' Association, and France's Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere.  Unfortunately for us all, he grew tired of his Dutch creation, and killed Van Der Valk off, just as this series was airing, in 1972.

The episodes are:
1.  One Herring's Not Enough.  A sculptor/art school teacher walks in to confess killing his wife and her young lover, but there's no sign of such a crime.
2.  Destroying Angel.  An unknown man living above a seedy bar is poisoned to death.  Commisaris Van Der Valk considers it a woman's crime, and suspects one of the sex workers in the brothel next door.
3.  Blue Notes.  A world-famous Dutch violinist returns to Amsterdam for a rare performance.  Someone smashes his Stradivarius, and then he ends up dead.
4.  Elected Silence.  The daughter of a controversial right-wing journalist disappears; where's the ransom note.  What's going on?
5.  Thicker than Water.  A well-to-do young Englishman shows up dead in an Amsterdam canal, and his powerful mother doesn't seem to care.  The dead man's trail leads Van Der Valk through the city's seamiest gay, transvestite, and sado-masochistic bars.
6.  The Adventurer.  A fatal accident; the dead man, a Lebanese, is carrying a gun and a picture of an anonymous local stonemason.  The commisaris is troubled.

Now listen, I initially saw this series during the years of my English exile; it was great company for me.  And I loved it: and I loved the underlying Freeling books.  I believe I read every one of them, up to the 1972 work in which the author killed off his best-loved character. So don't try to argue with my opinion on this.",1251504000,22,5551,5.83271375464684
8348027,5,B001Y44DKE,"On my first visit to Europe, our first stop was Amsterdam.  From my subconscious, I kept hearing this music I heard when I was young as we drove and walked around the most beautiful place I had ever been in my life.  We also went to Brussels, Bruges and Paris, which were also very beautiful- objectively perhaps more beautiful than Amsterdam, but I left my heart in Amsterdam with all the unbearably cute canal houses, canals and the huge, and I mean huge groups of bicyclists.  Iamsterdam forever now.  Where was I?  Anyway I went on the internet after we got home and spent a month looking for that music that ran thru my head.  It was from the KLM commercials I heard in the 1970s.  THEN  I found out it was  REALLY the theme from a TV show about a Detective in Amsterdam.  Luckily they had episodes on You Tube.  There was that addictive music, there was my new favorite place on Earth, and there was this quikey Detective that looked like the 3rd Doctor Who.  I was hooked.  If the show stunk I was hooked.  But even here I enjoyed the mysteries and would have watched the series if just for that.  I bought set 1 and set 2, but they don't have any more that play in American DVC machines, which drives me nuts- I would get every episode if I could.  Please, please release Van der Valk 3,4 and 5 for America!!!  Tot Ziens!",1508544000,,1329,4.294354838709677

8348034,3,B001Y44DKE,"I purchased Set 1 of the Van der Valk mysteries because I enjoyed reading Nicholas Freeling's books on which they are based. Visually and stylistically, the video series is a trip back to Amsterdam in the 1970s (a nostalgic fun thing) and back to 1970s-style moviemaking (talking heads - not so much fun). As in the books, the plots and characters are realistically ambiguous, so viewers looking for neatly wrapped-up endings may be frustrated. I'm not sorry I purchased Set 1, but I probably will not purchase Set 2.",1281052800,5,517,4.820224719101123
8348035,2,B001Y44DKE,"Barry Foster throws himself around the screen over-acting, drinking, smoking, eating, and generally stomping his way through the lead. Too Bad they couldn't have hired a better actor. Nicholas Freelings mysteries were a joy to read. On the strength of that and several positive reviews (cult classic etc) I bought the first set.  I certainly will not buy the second set and wish I could return the first.",1278374400,4,404,4.9411764705882355
8348036,5,B001Y44DKE,"I just started watching this series and liked it, however it is a little dated, after all, this was done in the seventies. But that in mind, this is quite good, I had never heard of Freeling until now, but I will now look for his books. Amsterdam just does not normally come to mind these days as a setting for a crime drama, but this is different enough to be intriguing!
Anyone that saw Barry Foster in ""Frenzy"" though surely got to appreciate him (or hate the character)I think I will enjoy this series and continue with it. One just has to remember, totally different from the Rock'em, Sock'em stuff of today!!!",1272153600,5,615,4.451327433628318
