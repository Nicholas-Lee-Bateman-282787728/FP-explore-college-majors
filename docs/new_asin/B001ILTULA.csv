8311151,5,B001ILTULA,"This is a great collection. If you are expecting Hollywood-style pace, eardrum-busting music and made-up, re-written history, forget it. Otherwise, it's a great addition to your collection. I'd compare it to a great ""mediatation wine,"" as we say in Italian: something flavorful that you sip on a little bit at a time as you meditate, thus spending a few hours with a mere glass or two. Also, I teach Italian and I highly recommend this to learners for it's very clear, perfectly enunciated, and beautifully written historical dialogs, which often come straight from classical books.",1483920000,,582,5.136842105263158
8311152,5,B001ILTULA,"Probably my favorite eclipse purchase so far. Worth every penny. Warm, cozy portrayal of Florence (the age of the medici). Takes you back to such a beautiful period in human history.",1422921600,,182,4.903225806451613
8311153,4,B001ILTULA,"Roberto Rossellini CARTESIUS (1974): This plays mainly as an intellectual biography (with lots of discourse on the method). At 2 hrs ad 40 min it can get tiring but if you stay with it it leaves you with a crystal clear picture of a crystal clear mind. I particularly liked the fact that Descartes rejected the Paris salons of his day (thought by most to be the intellectual centers of the world) and instead chose to travel, mainly through Northern Europe where men were less in thrall to intellectual tradition and more receptive to new ideas. Descartes spent a lot of time in the beer halls and coffee houses of the commercial centers through which the new ideas freely flowed and wherein the new ideas were freely discussed by men who had professions and experience of the world (this perhaps a less-discussed/lauded aspect of Descartes' method). One imagines that Rossellini has found a like soul in Descartes. Both men are certainly interested in using the new sciences and technologies of their respective days to see things more clearly as they are (and not as the teachings of renowned scholars/artists would have them believe they are). The main thing Descartes wanted to see more clearly was reason itself and he seemed to take great pleasure in examining reason and what man can truly know with it. Whats surprising is how earthy and cool Descartes is and how much everyone likes him and comes alive in his presence. His mission was to examine reason as well as to find the right use of reason and to humbly apply his method to each subject he put his mind to. And one imagines that this is what Rossellini is doing as well in this historical film...searching for and/or applying a right or suitable use of reason/of cinema/of art/of civilization (during one of its more turbulent and uncertain epochs). Certainly its very calming and civilizing to watch a 3 hr film about a man who dedicated himself to conversation and meditation. In Rossellini's hands, the New Realism (or at least the 1960's and 1970's incarnation of it) does function or can be viewed to function as an extension or re-invigoration of the enlightenment project and a re-discovery or re-affirmation of the value of clarity, unprejudiced clarity (in art and in science and in all things). I'll be checking out Rossellini's Age of the Medici (1973) next.",1421798400,3,2335,4.8254364089775565
8311154,5,B001ILTULA,"Cartesius is a biographical film about the French philosopher Rene Descartes. Interestingly, his actual works are quoted in the film, such as when Descartes is lecturing to other scholars. But this is done naturally. It seems like you are really witnessing Descartes' thought arising at that moment after much of his studied reflection (the duration and constant extension of which seems to slightly annoy his peers, desperately waiting for the great works that Descartes may create).

I would recommend this for anyone interested in philosophy or European history of the time portrayed, as well as students in philosophy who may wish to see concretely the context Descartes was working within.

The Italian spoken is very clear. It may be useful if you are trying to learn Italian and want audio examples which cover an interesting subject and are easy to follow.",1372723200,2,864,5.120567375886525
8311155,5,B001ILTULA,"Excellent, entertaining, and informative and with the special Rossellini touch.  The Italian is clear and beautiful vs. modern and jumbled!",1368316800,2,139,5.95
8311156,4,B001ILTULA,"It's a quite useful item for my professional pratice: it allows me to show my students Descartes's philosophica path in a way other than just reading the philosopher words... It' as if Descartes himself were talking to the kids, showing them his doubts, and how he solved them.",1331424000,3,277,4.791666666666667
8311157,5,B001ILTULA,"At last! Here are the three greatest achievements from the final phase of Rossellini's career in good transfers and - where appropriate - with a choice of different languages on the soundtrack, in addition to the subtitles. Previous (overpriced) VHS issues of two of them were visually poor, and offered only the Italian soundtrack version of ""Blaise Pascal"" (the French is better) and the English version of ""Age of the Medici"" (the Italian is MUCH better!); and an earlier DVD issue of the third, ""Cartesius"", was excellent but not easily available.

That Rossellini spent his last decade or so making what might be called docu-dramas for TV is due to the tragically widespread misinterpretation and undervaluing of his work in the two decades before. There were always admirers - especially in France in the fifties - who understood and revered his work, but so many others failed to appreciate its subtlety, originality, beauty and complexity of attitude that the director lost faith in fictional cinema. The documentary aspect that had long been a feature of his work took over, and he set about creating a body of TV films that would focus on key moments in History. The three multi-episode series ""Iron Age"" (1964), ""Man's struggle for survival"" (1967) and ""Acts of the Apostles"" (1968) have rarely been shown outside of Italy - though screenings of a gratingly dubbed, awkwardly truncated print of ""Acts of the Apostles"" in London in 2007 revealed that it contains some great moments. But ""The rise to power of Louis XIV"" (1966) was released theatrically abroad and, despite occasional lapses into stolidity, the intelligence, lucidity and elegance of most of its scenes impressed many viewers. However, apart from a handful of effective sequences, ""Socrates"" (1970) and ""Augustine of Hippo"" (1972) seem disappointing, at times graceless, even clumsy.

Everything appears to click, though, for ""Blaise Pascal"" and ""Age of the Medici"" (both 1972) and ""Cartesius"" (ie. ""Descartes"" 1974), and they are complex, near-flawless masterpieces. The long takes, the refined but insidious camera movements and the placing of actors in the context of images that vivify both the splendour and the squalor of their historical periods are a wonder to behold. If ""Blaise Pascal"" is the most moving of the three, it is also dark and chilling: in Pierre Arditi's affecting performance the French philosopher comes across as a sympathetic but quietly anguished figure, using his superior intellect largely for the good of others but unable to emulate his sister Jacqueline's devout religious faith, or to come to terms with the suffering he sees all around. Though bleak, the final deathbed sequence, with its eerily graceful tracks and ominously slow zooms, is sublimely great art that cannot be reduced to a single, simple meaning. By contrast, ""Cartesius"" glows with the light of enquiry and discovery: time and again a servant enters a darkened bedroom where Descartes is sleeping late, throws open the curtains, and daylight floods in, so that the erudite clutter of the restless thinker's environment is revealed with Vermeer-like radiance.

""Age of the Medici"" is chiefly concerned with the devious social, political and economic forces at work in 15th century Florence (and other Italian city states), but the human focal point, at first Cosimo de Medici (altruistic but ruthless) gradually becomes Leon Battista Alberti, portrayed as spokesman for the scientific and artistic underpinning of Renaissance humanism. Rossellini displays a franker admiration for Alberti than for any other historical figure in his films, which could be seen as a loss of ""objectivity"" - but it gives the final section of ""Age of the Medici"" a wonderful sense of uplift.",1322784000,8,3748,5.212271973466003
8311158,4,B001ILTULA,"Honestly, the title to this review tells all I have to say. So far, I've watched only the four-part ""Age of the Medici"" -- which is really only concerned with Cosimo dei Medici and with the society of Florence in his lifetime. One sees the signoria in action, the operations of banks and the labors of various artisans, and it's all quite educational though only at a newcomer level. The costumes are splendidly authentic, but the manner of wearing them is utterly stiff and unconvincing. However Cosimo and his peers conducted themselves, however they stood/bowed/spoke/frowned/smiled, I'm certain they maintained more ""bella figura"" and more animation than the actors in this historical pageant for TV. In fact, the only ""natural"" movement in the film is that of the horses, and by the by these actors don't ride especially gracefully. As I said, the costumes are vivid, but it seems rather unlikely that the walls of Florence, especially the exteriors, looked as weathered and dingy in the 15th C as they do in this film, even when they are obviously studio sets. Verisimilitude is a fickle goddess.

But I didn't watch these episodes as a history lesson. I wanted to freshen up my ability to hear spoken Italian and understand it, since I'll be spending a lot of time in Italy in 2012. My Italian has gotten foully corrupted by Spanish and French, ho ho. These films are perfect for that purpose! One can turn off the English subtitles, not always an option on Italian films distributed in North America. The accents are perfect 20th C classroom Italian, except for the use of ""messere"" instead of ""signore"". The actors speak with clarity and gravity, not very plausibly as passionate humans of the Renaissance but quite comprehensibly for a student of their modern language.

Roberto Rossellini belongs in the pantheon of great Italian film directors, but not for these stuffy episodes. His ""history films"" are for classrooms only, even if the classroom is your own living room.",1319846400,3,1983,4.934131736526946
8311159,5,B001ILTULA,"The three films in this series ( The Age of the Medici, Cartesius, and Blaise Pascal) were part of Rossellini's effort to awaken the public through the television medium. He felt that the "" mass media were accomplishing 'a sort of cretinization of adults.' Rather than illuminate people their great effort seemed to be to subjugate them,'to create slaves who think they are free'"".

Certainly these films by Rossellini aren't everyone's cup of tea. Slow moving  - yes. Lacking in action - yes.
They deal with ideas, ideas that helped create our modern world. The acting can be described as understated, but conveys the emotions of the characters. Rossellini felt that ""art can make you understand through emotion what you are absolutely incapable of understanding through intellect."" So though these films deal with ideas, we come to understand them through our heart.

Rossellini shows himself again to be a master film maker through these low budget, quickly filmed, made for television historical dramas. Once viewed they will not be easily forgotten.",1264291200,13,1054,5.152046783625731
8311160,5,B001ILTULA,"I am an avid fan of Italian cinema, but one director I never really got into was Roberto Rossellini.  I have seen Rome, Open City, Paisan, and Voyage to Italy, and I thought they were good films, but he was never one I talked about very much.  Recently, I watched all of the 3 films in this Eclipse/Criterion series (actually, there are 3 made for TV films, two of which are essentially miniseries), and I was surprised how much I liked them all.

These 3 films are unlike anything I've ever really seen.  I was really surprised by them.  Near the end of the 1960's, Rossellini felt cinema was dead, and decided to make films for TV.  He sincerely believed that television could be a true catalyst for change and for true educational purposes.  Roberto believed ignorance was the biggest obstacle to progress (he has a point there), and he made these 3 films (and The Taking of Power by Louis XIV, a film for French TV that's available in a seperate Criterion edition) in a genuine effort to educate the masses of Italy.  As to whether his intentions helped allievate the ignorance of people remains to be seen.  The 3 films are surprisingly good.

The films are not very conventional at all.  If you're expecting a sex filled, blood soaked, historically inaccurate Showtimes type series (or HBO series), you will be disappointed.  If you're expecting films that will genuinely make you think and demand your full attention, you will more than satisified.

The 3 films have the same characteristics.  Most of the shots are static, the takes are long, the performances are for the most part perfunctory, the dialogue is very dry and intellectual, yet all 3 of the films held my attention and are endlessly fascinating.  The costumes and set design are absolutely first rate.  In fact, some of the shots are reminiscent of Renaissance paintings (which I'm sure Rossellini meant to do).  The camera work is quite good.  The running times are very long.  The Age of the Medici runs 4 1/2 hours (but is in 3 parts), Cartesius runs 162 minutes (and is in 2 parts), and Blaise Pascal clocks in just over 2 hours.

The Age of the Medici is the best of the films.  It shows how Cosimo de Medici became a brilliant merchant and helped shaped Renaissance thought.  Despite its 255 minute length, the machinations of Medici and the Italian court are fascinating.  Cartesius is about Rene Descartes, and his struggles with finding a bridge between rational thought and the spiritual quest of being one with God and Jesus.  Blaise Pascal is the saddest of the films, with Pascal going on his own Descartes like quest and dying at the end of the film.  It's quite sad and moving, surprisingly so.  These films remind me of the austerity of Bressons's work, in that all the emotion is drained from the performances (Bresson did this intentionally), and the emotions are supplied by the viewers.  It's a challenge to watch these films, make no mistake about it.  But they are worth the challenge and are quite inspiring, especially to those interested in the time of the films.  I even broke out an old Descartes book that I had not read in many, many years after watching Cartesius.

I had never heard of these films until Criterion/Eclipse put them out.  I'm glad they did.  These 3 films (and The Taking of Power by Louis XIV) should all be seen.  While they are difficult and challenging, they are immensely worthwhile.",1249516800,50,3406,4.6897133220910625
