370264,3,6301802489,"The movie takes place during a bloody time period of Mexico history... At that time, anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish... But Lyedecker (Jim Brown) didn't speak the language... He was a black policeman looking for a valuable man, a bank robber named Joe Herrera (Burt Reynolds), who looks Mexican but doesn't talk Mexican... Herrera is a half-breed, whose mother was a Yaqui Indian and his father was from Alabama...

General Verdugo (Fernando Lamas) is sure that the money was not spent on women or on Whisky... For him, Joe stole the $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona to buy 100 rifles for his people, the Yaqui Indians...

Verdugo--a murderer and an assassin who runs the State of Sonora--have orders to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could, and he took the easy way by killing everybody... He even kidnapped Yaqui children to regain the rifles... And now he wants Lyedecker's head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see...

Lyedecker doesn't care about nothing and nobody... He took a job that nobody else wanted... His intentions are to take Joe back for the $200 reward and a permanent job... The policeman rejected any deal in spite of all the atrocities he witnessed like executing Indians or hanging them up like a side of beef...

Steven Grimes (Dan O'Herlihy)--who runs the railroad-- doesn't want his train to be a small sacrifice to the mean general... The German military adviser Lt. Von Klemme (Eric Braeden) thinks that the Indians must be finished off as quickly as possible before more guns come through... Raquel Welch's most audacious moment comes out when the Indians attack a well-guarded train carrying troops and supplies, and she was openly showering in the flat part, under a water tower...

With a very nice score by Jerry Goldsmith, ""100 Rifles"" is a slam-bang action epic, with loads of explosions and gory fighting, making little sense but a lot of amusing noise...",1231718400,10,1952,4.8149253731343284
370265,4,6301802489,Stars you wouldn't necessarily put together. Big stars in the era 1960's - 70's. Entertaining and spectacular. Overall a good movie for your collection.,1202428800,,152,5.375
370266,3,6301802489,"I admit - Raquel Welch, what a woman! I liked the acters in this flick. It wasn't bad. Burt Reynolds played a good wastrel. Fernando Lamas was the best though as the evil Mexican Commandant with his Colonel Klink sidekick/advisor (Victor Newman from the 'Young & the Restless'). Actually, Victor Newman, is an excellent cool actor. He should have been in more leading roles. I like his cool Prussian demeanor and would make a great stock bad guy. I was surprised that Jim Brown was able to pull it off not too bad.

One of those good 70s westerns, I recommend it.",1167609600,3,563,4.519607843137255

370268,3,6301802489,"Overall, the movie is an OK western.  Very watchable, but not great by any definition of the word.  But it has some memorable scenes, like the Raquel Welch scene at the water tower.",1152316800,5,181,4.454545454545454
370269,4,6301802489,"100 Rifles will never be considered a great western, but it is a fun watch with plenty of action and a good leading cast.  A Phoenix sheriff, Lyedecker, is pursuing a bank robber, Yaqui Joe a half-breed bandit, and ends up finding him in Mexico amidst an uprising.  Before Lyedecker can bring him in, he is captured alongside Joe who is wanted for giving rifles to the Yaqui Indians by the Mexican Army.  After a narrow escape, Lyedecker forms an uneasy, very uneasy, alliance with Joe to help the Yaquis fight back against the Mexican Army.  100 Rifles is one of many westerns that was released in the late 1960s trying to take advantage of the success of the Italian spaghetti westerns.  It has the feel of spaghettis and was filmed in Almeria, but was American financed.  All that aside, its a very enjoyable western with plenty of action.  Add a great score from Jerry Goldsmith and a great looking print on this new DVD, and you can't miss.

  Jim Brown stars as Lyedecker, the Phoenix sheriff trying to bring in Yaqui Joe for robbing a bank of $6,000.  Brown isn't considered a great actor, but he's very good here.  The man simply has a great presence on screen.  Burt Reynolds plays Yaqui Joe, a half-breed bandit trying to give rifles to the Yaqui Indians.  His part gives him some very funny lines, and together with Brown, they make a great duo.  Raquel Welch plays Sarita, the love interest who fights alongside the men.  She has a love scene with Brown, that at the time seemed shocking, but its pretty tame.  As expected, Ms. Welch looks amazing, and director Tom Gries gives the viewer plenty of chances to oggle her.  Fernando Lamas plays the evil Verdugo, the Mexican officer charged with wiping out the Yaquis while Eric Braeden offers advice as Von Klemme, a German advisor.  This long-overdue DVD offers a great looking widescreen presentation considering the movie is almost 40 years old, three picture galleries with about 60-70 photos, a 100 Rifles trailer, and trailers for three other 20th Century Fox westerns.  So if you're a fan of westerns, check out Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds, and Raquel Welch in the action-packed 100 Rifles!",1148860800,3,2155,4.711229946524064
370270,4,6301802489,"100 Rifles is the kind of Western you'd have expected someone to make in the late 1960's. One with a black US lawman, and two revolutionary Mexican Indians fighting for justice in their oppressed homeland. It would be easy to dismiss this as a politically correct western, even though it was made before the term was invented. But the cast and the production of 100 Rifles pulls it off, making a rare late 60's Western treat.

Jim Brown, recently retired football superstar, plays the US marshal with the virility and muscle that befits his status as one of the greatest, and definitely the most punishing running back in the history of the NFL. Burt Reynolds and Raquel Welch plays the two revolutionaries. Brown's character comes to Mexico chasing bank robbing Reynolds, ends up falling for Welch, and eventually helps both Reynolds and Welch with their revolutionary activities. Reynolds displays all of the vigor and charm that helped become the most popular box office star in the late seventies/early eighties, and Welch is, well Welch, oozing sex appeal and sensuality.

100 Rifles is definitely a product of the era in which it was made, but since there very few great Westerns made in the late 60's except movies like Hombre and The Wild Bunch, this is film to appreciate and treasure.",1146960000,27,1294,4.877272727272727

370437,3,6301802489,"Decent movie but Raquel could have been utilized much more.  As to aspect ratio:  I just saw this on ""movies-tv"" network in the 1.77 ratio (16 x 9).  The top and bottom of the 1.77 are cut compared to a 1.33 full frame from hbo.  Although there is more on the sides of the 1.77.  Amazon lists this as 1.85.  Looking at screen caps from the dvd on the net and comparing identical frames, The dvd cuts off even more on top and bottom but sides are same as 1.77.  I have no info as to film stock but suspect it is 35mm which is inherently 1.56 without masking. All this being said, it doesn't seem to take too much from the film or her.  Only part of her bottom half is cut off durring the water tower shower scene which is obscured anyway for those interested in only that aspect of the movie.  As to the reviewer that complained about no death scene for her, I have never seen a version with that in it.  We just see them find her dead.  For Raquel fans, fanstastic voyage and fathom are 2 with proper aspect ratios.  1 million years bc however is simply cut on top and bottom and 10 min. cut out.",1427846400,,1096,4.093896713615023

370511,5,6301802489,"100 HUNDRED RIFLES. This 1969 Western seems to have been greatly influenced by the Spaghetti Western enjoying great popularity in America at the time. One look at the film's opening credits is evidence of that. Director Tom Gries must have given way to the wishes of the producers on these points. Jim Brown, Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds are the perfect trio in this western set in Mexico during the revolution. Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) is very good as a German military adviser. Very good score by Jerry Goldsmith. This film has some very funny moments and good action scenes and a definite flavor for the genre.

Filmed in Spain, this film boasts very good cinematography by Cecilio Paniagua. Burt Reynolds performance as the half Indian Yaqui Joe Herrera really elevates this film to more than the sum of all its elements. His screen presence is truly amazing and he holds the attention of the viewer with his charm. It was also good to Dan O'Herlihy, Fernando Lamas and Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) in the cast.

370551,3,6301802489,"Although not based on one of his novels, 100 Rifles follows in the tracks of The Comancheros and Rio Conchos as another Clair Huffaker co-scripted Western that sees a lawman and a fugitive becoming unlikely allies in a plot involving rebels and a shipment of guns: obviously Huffaker was 20th Century Fox's go-to guy whenever they wanted to put a new spin on an old hit. The new spin this time is the influence of spaghetti Westerns (although the American Western had been moving south of the border since the 50s) and that rather than trying to infiltrate and defeat the rebels the heroes are trying to get the guns to them - in this case Yaqui Indians - to help them overthrow the government in the form of Fernando Lamas' sadistic governor who wants an Indian hanging from every telegraph pole. Instead of John Wayne, Stuart Whitman or Richard Boone, this throws in a more up-and-coming trio of Jim Brown, Racquel Welch and Burt Reynolds. Just to spice things up further, it even throws in an inter-racial love affair that caused a bit of a stir at the time.

That's about it for novelty, though. Although Tom Gries direction is more than decent and even has one impressive prolonged take of the government troops fortifying a town, this is more a decently crafted Saturday night action movie than anything more memorable and ambitious. The cast do what's expected of them, Brown in particular showing a natural star quality and screen presence in the `John Wayne role' while the script contrives to get Welch into a very wet shirt, though at times it's the characters on the sidelines like Hans Gudegast (just before Universal forced him to change his screen name to Eric Braedon) as a deceptively amiable but ruthless German military advisor and Dan O'Herlihy as an American railroad liaison who are trying to shift Lamas towards their own agendas that seem more fertile but undeveloped ground for the film. Indeed, that same year many of the same elements - bounty hunters, outlaws hijacking trains, peddling arms and coming up against mad Mexican generals and their foreign advisors - were being thrown into a very different and more morally complex mix in a film Sam Peckinpah was making down in Mexico about bad men who had outlived their time (just to add to the coincidence, Huffaker's wife was Peckinpah's lawyer!). This has no such ambitions - as the ad campaign stressed, the only message it has is ""Watch out!"" Still, the action is decent and Jerry Goldsmith, well into his prime now, turns in a brutally exciting and dynamic score that occasionally kicks the film soaring into a higher gear.

The US DVD is uncut - one horse stunt is cut from the UK DVD for legal reasons because of animal cruelty - and includes stills galleries and trailer, though sadly not the deleted scenes with Akim Tamiroff. The UK DVD only includes the trailer.",1374796800,3,2852,4.747983870967742
370552,3,6301802489,"1969's ""100 Rifles"" is something you should not pay a lot for.  The posters advertising for were more sensational than the end result.  Even the DVD is accurate  when it says ""They're All the Ammo They Need!""  Jim Brown, Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds headlined a spectacular cast that also included the much hated villains of Fernando Lamas, Dan O'Herlihy and Hans Gudegast.  The sparks between the cast members do not amount to much more than that.  Raquel is called upon to most over-zealous with her Yacci Indian accent.  Burt Reynolds has too much red-make-up on to distinguish him from a Mexican.  Jim Brown come out best, and those torrid scenes with Raquel that the movie posters promise do not amount for much but for him to have his shirt for the scene.  It is not a well-written Western, based on a novel by Robert MacLeod and screenplay by Clair Huffaker and Tom Gries.  Tom Gries directed.  He also directed ""Will Penny"" previously and has no serious credits since except he also directed ""Breakheart Pass"" with Charles Bronson in 1975.  20th Century-Fox released this casting coup for producer Marvin Schwartz.  Just wish they could have done something equally impressive with it, otherwise standard western, unexceptionally done.  Music by Jerry Goldsmith, Color by Deluxe.",1373414400,,1288,4.985915492957746

Sarita (Raquel's character) was the shining light in this production and kept me interested until she went against type near the end of the adventure.

370615,3,6301802489,"100 Rifles is one of those movies that was made during the late sixties and combined the talents of the rising stars of the day. The script was certainly predictable and the actors rose above the material. The gorgeous Raquel Welch showed some surprising range in her role as a tough revolutionary. Burt Reynolds wisely played his character with the slight insouciance that would make him into a superstar a few years later. And mighty Jim Brown stepped into the role as a leading man and sex symbol with his controversial (for the time) interracial love scene with Welch. It's a shame he didn't choose his roles more carefully because it was pretty much downhill after this film with his departure from big budget productions (like The Dirty Dozen, Ice Station Zebra and The Split) in favor of the poorly done blacksploitation flicks that wasted his acting talent and presence. All things considered, 100 Rifles is worth a look, though. It's a period piece really, made during a time of transition in our society. It's best watched with that perspective in mind.",1350172800,8,1063,4.846153846153846

Burt is a criminal with a big heart and Jim is the police officer out to get him.  Raquel is the native trying to save her people from the evil dictator.  Of course the bad guy doesn't know when he has it good and by capturing and losing Burt and Jim he creates his worse nightmare.  They team up with Ms Welch and stage the revolution to topple him. All three actors give excellent performance as do the supporting cast of peasants and villains.  A western made when the quality of the story was important.

370619,3,6301802489,"I remember watching 100 Rifles when I was younger and even then it was an old movie, a late show standby.  I bought it recently, recalling its great action and, of course, one of its three main stars, Raquel Welch.

100 Rifles, directed by the much-underrated Tom Gries, was released in 1969, starring a young Jim Brown, a young (but balding) Burt Reynolds and the young but lovely Raquel Welch, as respectively, a determined lawman, a mixed blood and genial mercenary and a Mexican revolutionary, set imprecisely during the Mexican Revolution of the 1910s (with southern Spain serving as Mexico).  The three principals, sometimes antagonistic to each other, sometimes not,  oppose a corrupt and cruel Mexican General (Fernando Lamas) as he tries to subdue a Yaqui Indian rebellion, Reynolds, Welch, and, eventually, Brown, work together to bring the titular 100 rifles and revolution to the Yaquis.  Dan O'Herlihy co-stars as an oily American railroad manager upset with Reynolds' and Welch Yaqui Indian rebel allies, who tear up his railroad, while Hans Gudegast, AKA Eric Braeden, appears as an advisor from the Imperial German Army.

Sadly, this film has not aged well. From what I can tell, this copy was heavily edited before release - veteran actor Akim Tamiroff is billed as a 'General Romero' but except for several characters mentioning his off-screen death, there is no sign of him. Of the three principals, Jim Brown was neither a gifted nor a trained actor and the best that can be said for his performance is that he brings a plausible physicality to the role of the determined lawman who, among things, pursues bank robber Reynolds and beds Raquel Welch, the latter something pretty shocking for 1969. Burt Reynolds had greater acting chops but there is little of the chemistry and his would-be antagonist, Brown, that audiences can see between Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the contemporaneous Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  Perceived at the time as little more than a blond bombshell,  Raquel Welch (who is actually hispanic and speaks Spanish fluently), while not above being exploited for her looks, nonetheless delivers the best performance of the three stars, one that is surprisingly convincing and has some depth. Pride of place must go to Lamas, though, as he chews up every scene he is in, making his character the most fun. Gudegast looks great and sounds great (he speaks the best English in the entire cast) but does not do much except amble about looking smug.  Director Gries excelled on recreating an authentic-looking Old West (or Old Mexico) and also in great action sequences and this 100 Rifles has in spades.  Middling acting and so-so story aside, Jerry Goldsmith composed a rousing and memorable musical score to accompany the great on-screen action. All in all, 100 Rifles is a guilty pleasure, and one I would not pay too much money for, but not without its joys.",1304035200,4,2913,4.963039014373717
370620,5,6301802489,"This spaghetti-flavored oater is one of the last of the Hollywood westerns, when the genre about faded from public consciousness. The film has an off-beat cast of players who are good, especially Burt Reynolds, who easily steals the film with a great performance. Jim Brown, an Arizona lawman, and Raquel Welch, a revolutionary spitfire, team up with Reynolds and Yaqui Indians who revolt against a tyrannical military leader. Fernando Lamas is the heavy here and Hans Gudegast is his German military adviser who advises Lamas in his war of extermination against the Indians. Jerry Goldsmith's excellent music score is in keeping with the music flavor south of the border and is one of his best scores in an impressive resume. A very good, if bloody film, that never received its proper due.",1282521600,,791,5.0
