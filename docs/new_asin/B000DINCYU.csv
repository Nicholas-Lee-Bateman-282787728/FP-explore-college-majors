8102426,3,B000DINCYU,"...but the young director chooses the wrong path: Instead of concentrating on the interesting drama  a forced marriage and a witty way out of it  he squeezes too much comedic action into his flick: there are drastic, but supposedly funny beatings, timid trips to the sex shop and to a bizarre ""natural healer"" and of course several chase sequences. Most actors do well, including the non-pros, but the main role of Mans was written as a sparrow-brained body builder. There is way too much prophanity. Nontheless, i had my fun.

I didn't see this as a multicultural comedy. For Lebanon, you could watch the ""chick flick"" Caramal (nice, but not very deep, taking place in a peaceful Beirut). My DVD of The Best Man's Wedding shows several very interesting scenes that were cut out from the final movie. On my DVD, the director's spoken commentary was in Swedish.",1361923200,,860,4.797297297297297
