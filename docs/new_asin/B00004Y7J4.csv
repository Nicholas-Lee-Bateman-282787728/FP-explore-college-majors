7926917,5,B00004Y7J4,This episode is the conclusion to the series. It answers a lot of questions and will keep you on the edge of your seat with huge action scenes and mind capturing images. I won't give away the ending but this episode will show you why Cowboy Bebop is so unique. And why it is THE anime. I mean they're making a movie on it coming out in U.S. in April 2003. If you like the Coboy Bebop series this is a must have.,1048723200,,411,3.963855421686747
7926918,5,B00004Y7J4,"I myself love action...I'm about the only girl that does. Anyhoo ""Cowboy Bebop: The Real Folk Blues"" did have a not so ""happily ever after"" ending. But (for those of you who've seen Escaflowne) It wasn't like you didn't know it was comming. Not like Escaflowne. Now that movie got me mad. >.< Through-out almost all of the episodes they basically give you hints about the ending. It's a great movie, lots of action, blood, music and emotion. You gotta see this!",1027900800,,461,4.634146341463414
7926919,5,B00004Y7J4,"Out of all the anime I have seen in my life, this has to be the most thought out with amazing music that I cannot rave enough about, a wonderful story, and wonderfully developed characters. This suspenseful ending to an already enticing show kept me on the edge of my seat until the ending credits(make sure you watch it carefully...if you have a good eye you'll catch something). These episodes were my favorite two because a little of the mystery puzzle is put together and the fight scenes are spectacular. The music is better than expected with more of the wonderful animation you have grown to expect.  I would not miss it if I were you!",1016755200,4,642,4.5344827586206895
7926920,2,B00004Y7J4,"I waited and waited for these two episodes to come out since I just couldn't get enough of Cowboy Bebop. After this poor excuse of an ending came on Adult Swim that night, I wanted to mail a bomb to Japan! When Edward and Ein left the Bebop crew for good, the rest of the series episodes began going down in flames. Bad move right there. Sappy love stories and cliche rivalies between former friends has given this series a bad name. Hello people! This was suposed to be about bounty hunters that face action adventure and mayhem all the way through! In fact these are the same mistakes that most anime shows make. I only gave this two stars instead of one since it had some readical action in it.",1009670400,,697,4.32824427480916
7926921,5,B00004Y7J4,"Unfortunate as it may be, one of the most unique and incredible anime series ever made had to come to an end sometime.  However, as much as I dreaded seeing this series end, I couldn't have looked any more forward to it.  If you've seen the whole series up to this point, you're probably wondering how they tie up all the loose ends in the story and bring everything to a head in just two episodes.  The conclusion is nothing short of surprising.  It was nothing like I expected, yet considering all the events leading up to it, it couldn't have ended any other way.  It reveals all, yet leaves a few things to the imagination.  The final confrontation between arch-rivals Spike and Vicious is one of the greatest (and shortest) final battles in anime history, and is definitely the high point of this volume.  The animation, the soundtrack, and the action, just like the rest of the series, all pure brilliance.  If you're reading this, you've probably seen the rest of this series, but if, by some chance, you haven't, Cowboy Bebop is an experience not to be missed.  There will never be another show like it.",979603200,4,1111,4.570707070707071
7926922,5,B00004Y7J4,"The last volume of Cowboy Bebop didn't dissapoint me one bit. The first epsiode 'The Real Folk Blues Part 1' was great. Vicious trys to pull of a coup against the Red Dragon and fails. Now Spike is a main target. Later, Faye runs into Julia, Spike's long lost girlfriend, and gives Faye a message for Spike. When Faye returns, the ships attacked. At the same time, Vicious is about to be executed, but escapes and kills the three elders. After the battle, Spike heads out for Julia. In 'The Real Folk Blues Part 2', Spike and Julia are together at last, but they're plans to escape are shattered when they get into a gun fight and Julia dies. After that, Spike heads out to raid the Red Dragon HQ to kill Vicious once and for all. I won't tell you the ending, but it is very depressing and at the same time very well done. The music couldn't have been better and fight scenes were better than 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' and 'Black Dog Serenade' combined. I really loved this series since it didn't really tell you anything about whats going on till the end. Well, if you wanna try something new that close to Bebop (although nothing can be greater than it), try Outlaw Star, Trigun or Castle of Caglistro. Anyway, Bebop is a great series. Do not miss it.",973900800,,1253,4.405172413793103
