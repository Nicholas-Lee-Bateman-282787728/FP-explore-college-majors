The film was a Super-Hit when it released, and ya it deserved to be. Good script, well directed, fantastic sound-track and classy performances.

Songs: All the songs are amazing, especially Yeh Tera Sajna Sawarna.

Performances: Mithun is first-rate. He's a true star/actor of Indian Cinema. Ashwini looks cute and does a good job. Puneet Issar is effective. Prem Chopra is first-rate. Others are passable.

On the whole 'Cheetah' is a solid entertainer. Watch this one, to get dazzled. Two Thumbs Up!",1304380800,,658,4.963636363636364
