5696791,2,B00C7T0EPS,"I bought this film based purely on the premise. Julianne Moore plays psychologist Cara Harding who finds herself investigating the case of Adam, a young man who seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder. But as Cara delves deeper into his strange case she soon finds that the answers to Adam's condition are far more sinister than she had ever imagined. **contains some spoilers**

I hoped this would be a smart psychological thriller perhaps with a neat twist thrown in somewhere. I got a twist all right but it certainly wasn't what I had been hoping for. The most disappointing thing about this film is that somewhere in amongst the mess there is a hint of something better, something that never was.

The first half the film is carried by Jonathan Rhys Meyers who plays Adam and all of his personalities. His perfomance in this film really was excellent. He slips from personality to personality with remarkable fluidity while managing to remain extremely convincing. His character switches were what convinced me to keep watching the film since I had been very unimpressed with the rest of it. It wasn't that Julianne Moore was bad - per se - but she was boring. The character had no depth or interest and this was highlighted all the more when she was up against Meyer's bold performances.

Unfortunately the film, which could have ben smart, then completely derails itself as it descends into a steaming pile of nonsense. The psychological element becomes the supernatural as Harding discovers that Adam's 'personalities' are in fact the spirits of murder victims. Even this might have been workable with a decent script but the directors seemed hellbent on destryoing their own film. The moment Harding goes running off to find a bunch of gypsies living in the mountians, and the wizened old crone that appears to lead them, I knew the film had dug itself into a hole from which it could not crawl out. No explanation is offered as to why the Harding character goes running off to visit these cliche gypsies and their even more cliche crone. How Julianne Moore sat through these scenes without laughing I honestly do not know.

Ultimately the film succumbs to the most irritating of horror tropes - let's run screaming through the spooky forest at night. This is a trope that I can barely stand to see in a horror film let alone a 'psychological thriller'. The supernatural explanation offered for the events in the film is poorly executed and downright silly, with characters constantly preaching about God and religion and what will happen to a non-believer.

The first half of the film is worth watching simply for Meyer's impressive performance but if you do switch off halfway through, you really wouldnt miss anything. The film promised so much and gave so little, ending with nothing but plot holes and the dropped jaws of the audiences who - like me - couldn't believe they sat through the whole hour and forty minutes for that pitiful conclusion",1337990400,22,2971,4.85207100591716
5696792,5,B00C7T0EPS,"this was a very good movie and I do not understand why it never made it to the big screen-was someone afraid that jonathan rhys meyers might have gotten an award for his performance-he is the best actor around-he can take any part and make it so believable-julianne moore was okay but jonathan carried the movie-he is an actor ,singer (and may i say he is very good at singing),plays the guitar,a model and i must say he fits the ideal model description-but first and foremost he was extraordinarily great in his acting abilities-i have almost all of his movies and and was glad to add this one to my collection-anyone should feel that they are getting their moneys worth when they buy this movie-",1314662400,4,697,4.584
5696793,5,B00C7T0EPS,"This movie was left at my house by a friend who had purchased it from a man at his job last week. I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked it because I just came out of a relationship with a man who acted exactly like the character of Johnathan Myers. Myers played the part of a man who was possessed however carried traits of a serious personality disorder. How the playright came up with this idea was wonderful in my opinion. The movie balanced itself off by adding a twist of religion thoroughout--withcraft, Christianity, and a strong faith lesson towards the ending of the movie. The message here is very very strong. Julianna Moore played the part of the pyschiatrist as well, the daughter of one who was persistent in helping this one particular client--Myers. Another twist in the movie is seeing the demonic forces take over not only her client, but her daughter as well. In conclusion, the movie is a winner and definitely tells a meesage about losing your faith in God. The journey in which this movie takes you is inspiring enough to make you actually sit back when it is over and address your own faith and beliefs. Can't wait to own my own copy.",1299801600,7,1167,4.535545023696683
5696794,2,B00C7T0EPS,"The start of this movie is promising. Julienne Moore plays Dr. Cara Harding, a psychiatrist who does not believe in multiple personalities disorder. Her father, played by Jeffrey DeMunn, introduces her to a patient who he believes is an interesting case since he is a young man who appears to have split personalities (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Rhys Meyers is incredible as he flawlessly and believably acts out various personalities with different accents and mannerisms. DeMunn was excellent too but I did not really care for Julienne Moore in this as I found her somewhat boring and not credible.

The movie is great for the first half or so but then it gets boring and stupid as it morphs from a fast-paced psychological thriller into a confusing far-fetched supernatural horror movie. If the second half could have continued like the first, I would have thought it was a great thriller. But the second part spoils it. Not worth the time to watch.",1298246400,6,958,4.877300613496932

5696797,2,B00C7T0EPS,"Julianne Moore stars in this psychological thriller about a man who takes on the identities of those who've been killed by a mysterious disease. Like most films about schizophrenics or sociopaths, 6 Souls spends a lot of its time analyzing Daniel/Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) before it gets to its confusing paranormal bent - that the body holding Daniel and Adam is actually an old spirit trapping souls, for some reason that's not explicitly clear.

Moore plays Cara Harding, a psychologist cowed by her father's legacy in the field. Repeatedly questioned by him, she takes on a case he refers to her because of its eccentricities: the man can change between the paraplegic Daniel and the able-bodied but aggressive Adam with just a phone call, and it appears that Daniel is actually someone who died 25 years ago. As Moore attempts to dissect one identity from the other, she finds Adam/Daniel quickly takes on more and more, and her friends and family begin to die around her. Crazy!

Except it's not. 6 Souls has been done numerous times in different forms, all of them fairly similar to this one from directors Mans Marlind and Bjrn Stein. Though the film doesn't stick to its psychological roots as it probably should, the paranormal aspect of the film is also derivative - it uses the same tricks throughout to glean scares, and most of them don't work. A witch doctor, an old spirit: they've been done before, they'll be done again, and all have had more soul than 6 Souls.

Moore looks tired in this film, and that's due to the interminable running time here. If 6 Souls were a song, it would be the kind that rambles on and on without end - I'm thinking a Dave Matthews live jam. Part of the film's longevity comes from the filmmakers trying to describe exactly what's going on. There's mumbo jumbo about souls' shelters, there's a witch doctor who sees out of a young girl's eyes, there's something about a sickness where the victims cough up dirt. All of it is so overdrawn that the film concludes about as well as a grandfather falling asleep mid- war story.

The opening of the film starts out pretty strong, too, which makes everything all the more disappointing. If 6 Souls had simplified its plot a little bit, maybe cut out a few of the paranormal aspects, it might have been a more successful, if generic, movie. But 6 Souls goes for broke, and it winds up making little sense - probably not the kind of ending one would want for a film analyzing the sensibilities of those deemed ""crazy.""",1481241600,,2508,4.667420814479638

How anyone can rate this dud with a 5 star rating is a puzzle and might consider having their brains sand blasted, and please, take along this ""actress"" on the ride.",1438646400,,639,4.663716814159292
5696817,2,B00C7T0EPS,"Released in 2010 as Shelter overseas, the film was retitled 6 Souls for its U.S. release.  Julianne Moore is a psychiatrist named Cara who has specialized in debunking claims of multiple personality disorder.  She receives a call from her father, Dr. Harding (Jeffrey DeMunn of The Walking Dead) who is also a Psychiatrist about a patient he wants her to see.  She meets David (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a wheelchair-bound young man.  When David receives a call from Dr. Harding, he immediately transforms his personality into a man called Adam, who is able to get up out of the wheelchair and walk without any problem.

Cara looks into the histories of both of the mans personalities, convinced he created the personality after reading about them in newspapers.  Yet when she tracks down Davids mother (Francis Conroy of American Horror Story), and has her meet the man, he knows details about Davids life that he could not possibly know.  Things grow more terrifying as David begins to display other personalitiespersonalities of people who have recently died.  As she begins to doubt her theory, her investigations take her to the rural hill country where she meets a blind old woman called Granny who reveals that David is something much more terrifying than simply a man with a mental disorder.

I enjoyed 6 Souls for about the first two-thirds and then it sunk like a stone.  There was nothing wrong with the introduction of the supernatural elements of the story until they became a convoluted mess about fire and brimstone preacher in the 1910s who lost his faith in God and became possessed by an evil force that is never clearly defined.  The last twenty minutes of the film is just about beyond comprehension that leaves you shaking your head over what just happened when it concludes.  Its too badthe film had some promising elements and is bolstered by an exceptional cast but ultimately tries to get too cute for its own good.",1438387200,3,1937,4.854103343465046

5696856,4,B00C7T0EPS,"{3.5 stars}

6 SOULS has a compelling and unique storyline that nicely intermixes spiritual and psychological elements: There are some very original ideas here. It's well-produced and cinematized with realistic acting by all. It has the necessary focus but still leaves room for individual interpretation, the sort of film that you can watch multiple times, picking up new details and subtleties with each view. At times it seems pro-Christian, at times anti-Christian, or at least critical of the superstitious-fundamentalist brand of Christianity. Again, the religious elements are clear enough yet also vague enough.

The plot does drag and meander a good bit. There are also some of the usual tired old demon-tropes (people throwing up black goop, etc). Still, this film has a fairly solid mythos behind it and relies more on surprise and suspense than it does raw schlock. While nothing really truly special, 6 SOULS is probably worth seeing if you like psychological/supernatural horror and have been disappointed by a lot of the other recent efforts in this genre.

The ending leaves room for an interesting sequel.  .  .7 SOULS?",1384041600,,1136,5.21978021978022

5696860,3,B00C7T0EPS,"6 Souls starts with an awesome, mysterious concept that even through it's full reveal I absolutely loved. It was great trying to unravel what exactly was going on with Jonathan Rhys Meyer's schizophrenic character -- especially with how fantastic of a job Meyers did with it. He was incredible. The idea was great.

Sadly, it got plugged into a ho-hum storyline. Moore acts well enough as the outsider trying to dig out the truth, but it plays out like many, many movies just like it. My wife was able to call out almost the entire rest of the movie from the midway mark. It was cruelly predictable.

Another down point for me is that there was not much of a fear factor to it. I know that this is more of a thriller than an all out horror movie, but it did have its moments going down the all out horror vein where it could have been creepy, nerve-tingling, and even frightening but that punch never hit.

It is at least not BROKEN as a movie, and I enjoyed watching it despite the predictability. I'll definitely chalk that up to the cast who all did an excellent job.

5696865,2,B00C7T0EPS,"Okay. I'm going to explain why a film that I was totally entranced by for the first hour or so completely crapped the bed due to one horrible plot choice.

First, let me say that the premise was totally up my alley. I'm a horror hound. That is to say, I love horror films. Obsessively, you might say. I noticed in other negative reviews that some folks had a stick up their bum regarding the involvement of the supernatural. It wasn't just a psychological thriller. It had key points that included voodoo, and that offends my Christian inability to suspend my disbelief. Waaah! Boo-freakin-hoo. That magical involvement had absolutely ZERO to do with my dislike of the flick. As a matter of fact, I became more interested when the fantastical bits began to fall into place. That's the gravy on my movie turkey, people.

I'd also like to briefly speak to the acting quality. Rhys-Meyers was on his game like nobody's business, jumping from one believable personality to another in a whirlwind of accents and physical expression. A+ for him. Julianne Moore did a decent job, and don't believe the other reviews that state her performance was stiff. Some people don't understand the difference between an understated, reserved character and understated, reserved acting. How many doctors of psychological science do you know that bop around like a melodramatic jackass or some colorful scenery-chewer a'la the Coen Brothers? She's a single mom constantly wanting her father to take her work more seriously. Emotional conservation fits the role just fine. I can't recall the name of the actor who portrayed her father right now, but he's a ""that guy"" you've seen in plenty of other films, and in this he's more youthful than usual. Highly likable as the father who wants his daughter to loosen up a bit.

The cinematography is great with plenty of wide location shots making you feel isolated and at the mercy of your surroundings.

Now that that's out of the way, here's the problem.

***SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.***

Julianne Moore's younger brother, coincidentally a computer wizard, is casually watching a video tape of the MPD suffering patient sleeping right before the patient's body convulses due to the presence of a new personality becoming dominant. He notices some weird shadowy, cloudy stuff in the air near the patient right before the convulsion. As he is a master of sound wave technology among other programming talents... sigh... he immediately realizes that the shadowy-cloudy thing has the shape of a digital representation of a sound wave. Pretty lame, right? Hold on, it gets lamer. He then transfers the dimensions of the thing to his sound wave generator by tracing its outline and somehow moving that outline to the sound machine. Then he listens to what that outline would sound like in audio form, and HOLY SPIT! NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH AND MUST TELL MY SISTER! So many questions. How did he trace the shape on an old school VHS monitor showing grainy ass security footage? Not explained. How did he then move that technologically-impossible-with-just-a-VCR tracing to his soundwave imaging machine? No idea. Why would a supernatural being organically be in the shape of how we humans have decided that sound waves appear with our digital graphing tech? You tell me. How was this all accomplished by simply TYPING ON HIS KEYBOARD, as specifically shown in the film? We'll never know.

What we have here is a method by which lazy screenwriters manipulate the story to service the moving of a possible plot idea to a solidly established plot point. This method is the writer betting on the viewer's technological ignorance making them accept a ludicrous story element that involves them crazy computers. Happens all the time. Not so much now as in the 1980s when folks didn't all have a computer/phone/mp3/GPS/txt device in their pocket. Go back and watch some flicks from the '80s that had computers as part of the main plot. It's pretty ridiculous. If you want to rip your hair out, go watch little Matty Broderick in War Games.

So, that's what ruined 6 Souls for me. Some of you may be arguing that if I can suspend my disbelief regarding the voodoo and whatnot, why can't I do the same for this hiccup? Well, to put it simply, just because it has elements of fantasy doesn't mean it can't make sense. Just because Superman can fly, it doesn't mean that I would accept a Superman movie wherein he all of a sudden can become a female at will. We establish where the rules bend a little, and from that point on, we don't allow any more bending. The evil soundwave spirit is just lazy and dumb.

I hope this steers some of you away, but I do admit to really liking just about everything else in the film.",1375660800,6,4733,4.804668304668304
5696866,2,B00C7T0EPS,"6 Souls (Mns Mrlind and Bj&ouml;rn Stein, 2010)

For about half its length, with one glaring exception noted below, 6 Souls (originally released under the title Shelter) is a very interesting supernatural thriller. Then screenwriter Michael Cooney (Identity) starts pulling in some weird theological arguments, and the movie gets kicked off-kilter, but it was probably still salvageable at that point. Then comes the climax, and it's terrible, but not so terrible that it made me want to gouge my eyes out.

Then comes the denouement.

So really, the best thing I can say about 6 Souls is that if you turn it off ten minutes before the end, you're actually going to get a pretty good movie. It focuses on Cara Harding (Far from Heaven's Julianne Moore), a psychologist who subscribes to the belief that Dissociative Identity Disorder, under whatever name you'd like to shelve it, does not exist. Her father (The Green Mile's Jeffrey DeMunn), a psychologist himself, calls her in for a consult on a patient named David (b. Monkey's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). While she's talking to him, dad flips David's switch, and David becomes Adam. The challenge: Cara has to prove that one of the two personalities is the real guy, and that he somehow found out enough about the other one--also a real guy--to have completely assimilated the other personality. But of course, things are not nearly so simple as that...

One of the biggest problems with this movie is one of the biggest problems with Julianne Moore's career--her inconsistency as an actress. When she brings her A game, she is capable of taking a three-minute cameo and turning a good film into a great one (Chicago Cab). When she doesn't, well, we get the unwatchable crap that is Safe. I'm not sure I've ever seen her flip it on and off in the blink of an eye before this movie, but Julianne Moore in the opening sequence, when she's giving testimony, and Julianne Moore in the second sequence, when she's in a bar afterwards, might as well be two different actresses. The testimony scene is as wooden as the fake coughing fit she goes into about a quarter of the way through Safe. It's just plain terrible. But then she seems to find her stride, and for most of the movie, we get the good Julianne Moore capping off a high-powered cast (aside from those mentioned above, Brooklynn Proulx, Frances Conroy, and Brian Anthony Wilson all have major parts, and you'll recognize a lot of the folks in minor roles here) who, once the movie starts digging its own grave, do the best they can with the script they'd been given. And like I said above, up until the big climax, the movie is still relatively salvageable; just turn it off right around the time Sammy and Stephen get to the holler and you're good to go. You'll miss the climax, but trust me, it's as predictable as anything on the Hallmark Movie Channel; you can fill in the blanks yourself, and you'll probably do a better job. But if you must watch the climax, for the love of Lazarus, turn the movie off before that godawful final scene you just know is coming. It is a soul-crusher. It has the potential to make you hate actors you otherwise revere. You have been warned. * ",1374969600,6,3185,4.690518783542039

5696870,2,B00C7T0EPS,"My wife and I both like to watch Julianne Moore, possibly for different reasons. But even well known actors apparently need to put bread on the table every now and then. On Amazon it was billed as a movie about personality disorders, usually a topic we reserve for hot summer evenings. It started out just as we expected, but half way turned into an Appalachian voodoo tale with witches sucking life out of long dead religious firebrands and breathing it into the souls of humans that were contaminated with a pestilent cross on their backs. You may be relieved to know, oops, spoiler, that it turns out well for Julianne and her daughter although the same cannot be said for her brother and father.

Amazon, as much as I admire the company, is not like Netflix where you can trust that you will like a movie with 4 or even 3 stars that has been recommended for you.",1373068800,2,866,4.481012658227848
5696871,3,B00C7T0EPS,"There's nothing worse than a supernatural thriller that has you mesmerized for the first two acts only to lose your respect in the last two. That's exactly how I felt when I pressed ""Stop"" after watching ""6 Souls."" All the warning signs for a movie that doesn't deliver were there. For instance, it was originally released in 2010 with a different title (""Shelter"") and just now is seeing the light of day.

Dr. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore) is introduced to a patient named Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who has multiple personalities. After researching some of them, she realizes they are all actual murder victims. Cara starts digging into the man's past to discover how or if his personalities all tie together somehow. Her investigations lead to encounters with the victim's relatives and mysterious religious fanatics.

Talk about a movie showing promise and then just falling off the deep end halfway through. ""6 Souls"" carries itself quite well with good pacing, creepy sequences, and a mystery that keeps you wondering what is really going on throughout. Suddenly, the whole thing derails and becomes a confusing mess which pits the followers of a weird mix of voodoo and Christianity against a crazy faith healer in a fatal spiritual battle.

One really positive aspect of the movie is we get to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers really flex his acting muscles. He plays several distinct characters that each carry themselves uniquely and are from different parts of the country and use different accents. We get to see firsthand how talented Rhys Meyers really is.

""6 Souls"" gets points taken off with me because it exhibits mixing voodoo and Christianity together. As a Christian, the film loses any credibility with me when the crazy old Granny Holler Witch (Joyce Feuller) is shown chanting over a body, sucking a man's soul out, and putting it in a jar before she begins curing him. People aren't supposed to combine pagan practices with Christian ones. The very idea is completely un-Biblical.

""6 Souls"" looks and sounds wonderful. The 5.1 surround sound enhances the viewing experience by sonically submerging the audience directly into the center of the action. The picture is clear and the melancholy colors used for the movie fit its bleak tone.

There's no bonus material featured on the Blu-ray version of ""6 Souls."" I can't believe there isn't audio commentary or a trailer for the movie included just to give the release some type of supplements. It would've been nice to hear what writer Michael Cooney or directors Mns Mrlind and Bjrn Stein were thinking when the movie comes unhinged and veers off-track in the end.

I wanted to like ""6 Souls"" as I popped it into my Blu-ray player. I was engaged and caught up in its initial narrative for about 70 of its 112 minutes. Unfortunately, the tale comes unraveled and spins out of control leaving an incoherent mess in its wake. Not even great acting from Julianne Moore and an even more impressive performance by Jonathan Rhys Meyers could save this from coming across as an inept attempt at making a supernatural thriller or psychological horror film.",1372809600,,3116,4.935114503816794
5696872,3,B00C7T0EPS,"This movie has so much potential.  Although not a bad movie overall, it could have been a lot better than it was.  J. Moore and J. Rhys Meyer played their parts very well and every actor brought the suspense that was needed to make it a thriller but the way the movie played out did not live up to the hype and excitement brought on by the trailer nor the description.  Best to view on Netflix before you choose to purchase DVD or Blu-ray.",1372809600,,439,4.2023809523809526
5696873,5,B00C7T0EPS,"The concept of multiple personality disorders is an interesting but frightening one.  I'm not sure why, but the idea that someone might have multiple `people' living inside of them is terrifying to me.  I guess it freaks me out because you never know who you would really be speaking to if that was the case.  So, when 6 SOULS came around, I knew it was going to be a film I had to check out.  I'm glad I did, too...not only is this movie a heck of a thrill-ride, but it's also smartly written and very entertaining.

The whole air of this movie just screams `creepy'.  Of course, mental health is almost a completely different world in itself, so the sense of foreboding is probably pretty justified.  That backdrop combined with the premise of the film set the stage for a staggering horror jaunt that will haunt you long after the credits roll.

One major aspect of the terror contained within 6 SOULS is the acting.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the role of a lifetime.  Each time a new persona takes over his body, Rhys Meyers goes into a fit of sorts, contorting his body into impossible positions as the `person' struggles to the top of the body.  Then, once the persona is in place, Rhys Meyers does an impeccable job of portraying him or her.  From a crippled, back-woods mountain boy to an elderly doctor and more, this role offers the actor the chance to shine and show his immense diversity of talent.  Julianne Moore is also noteworthy as the doctor; I've enjoyed seeing her on-screen for many years, and I hope she continues to make films for many more.

The film is shot well and pacing is nice, but the story itself is where it shines.  The audience is given just enough information as the film progresses to stay in-touch with what is going on, and this helps to create an intense and thrilling atmosphere.  Then, as the puzzle comes together towards the end, the film grabs the audience in a choke-hold and doesn't let go.  The result is a fine horror flick that any genre fan should be happy to own.

6 SOULS is a definite win for me and I recommend giving it a look.  There's not really any gore, but there's plenty of intensity; I might even say this is a perfect date movie if you are looking to scare your significant other without grossing them out.  Regardless of who you're with when you watch it, check this film out for sure.",1372377600,2,2351,4.46135831381733
5696874,4,B00C7T0EPS,"""Where am I and why would you think that I was Adam?"" Cara Harding (Moore) is a female forensic psychiatrist that discovers that all of one of her patient's multiple personalities are murder victims. The more she digs the more personal the case becomes. When her subject begins to take on the personalities of those closest to her she switches from trying to help him to trying to stop him. But is it too late? This is a movie I had no expectations for going in at all. That said I really enjoyed this and I recommend this to all horror fans. While most recent horror movies have become like Saw, just hacking people up, this one has more of a Silence Of The Lambs feel. More psychological thriller then straight horror but the movie is still pretty disturbing in most parts. The movie reminded me a lot of Fallen, so if you liked that then you will also like this one. I sure did. One of the better horror movies to have come out in a long time. I recommend this. Overall, part Identity part Fallen but all entertaining and a little creepy in parts.

5696875,4,B00C7T0EPS,"Spooky movies are all ridiculous because they are all frightening trips outside of reality.  So I judge them strictly upon their ability to hold my interest.  This one did a pretty good job.  Like a lot of them, this one starts out with a logical scientific explanation of the character's strange behavior along psychological pathologies, but becomes ""spooky"" when it's found that something other worldly is at the root of the problem.  The ability of the writers and producers to come up with something unique, that hasn't been done before is a challenge which, to me, often determines the success of the story line.

This one uses what world religions have used for centuries to control the masses . . . ""Believe without question, or you'll wish you had.""  By the time the protagonist realizes the error of her ways, it's either too late, or at least almost too late to avert disaster.  The only diversion from that old formula is the connection to old mountain ways and an old crone rather than a well recognized and accepted religion.  The very ending has been done and over done too many times, but all in all a pretty entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it and my popcorn.",1367020800,13,1173,4.682926829268292
