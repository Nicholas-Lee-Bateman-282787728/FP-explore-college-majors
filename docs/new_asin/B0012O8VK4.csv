8678469,2,B0012O8VK4,"If you're interested in a video that shows kill after kill on African animals, this is the DVD for you. I like my videos to encompass the entire hunt. The adventure of getting there. Some discussion about the area where the hunt will take place. How the hunt is being planned and executed. Getting to know the hunter. The difficulties encountered in the blind or on the track. The decisions leading up to selecting a particular animal. The drama of tracking the animal. This DVD has very little of what draws me to dvd's with Tom Miranda or Fred Eichler. It isn't a hunting DVD, it's a killing DVD. I learned very little about hunting African animals.",1396224000,,651,4.572649572649572
