The movie begins with the Battle of Antietam in 1862. Captain Robert Gould Shaw learns the North will raise Colored Troops to fight for the Union. They are Volunteers. Col. Shaw reads them the news from Richmond: any colored man will be sent back into slavery, those who are armed will killed; white officers will be killed as rebels. They show their training and their personalities. They receive muskets but no shoes or uniforms. The rumor is that Colored Troops will only be used for labor and not sent into combat. One deserter gets the usual punishment: tied to a wagon wheel and flogged. (He has scars from earlier whippings.) The men need shoes. Their feet are sore from marching in bare feet. Colonel Shaw takes action with the Quartermaster to get shoes and socks.

Will they get less pay than white troops? Colonel Shaw shows leadership. Once properly dressed in uniforms they parade down a city street before people. [Note the dirt streets.] One soldier is promoted to Sergeant Major for his performance. They arrive in Beaufort SC in 1863. They meet contraband. New Englanders went sought to teach reading and writing to the newly freed. Another officer has a different outlook, he orders the burning of the town! The warehouse with cotton is set afire. Being used for labor is bad for morale. Colonel Shaw writes to his father about this. He tells what he knows to Colonel Montgomery and his request is granted. The 54th CT meets the enemy and repulses them. There is close combat, some are wounded. They hear of the victory in Gettysburg Pennsylvania.

These troops must capture Fort Wagner by a frontal assault. The Massachusetts CT will lead the attack (they haven't slept in two days) on a narrow strip of land after nightfall. The troops form up for the attack, they fix bayonets and charge. Cannon fire cuts them down, they go on, then duck behind the dunes and wait for darkness. Charge! The Southerners fire down on them. Colonel Shaw leads the way, he is the first to be shot down. The others follow to enter the fortifications. Daylight reveals the bodies. The Confederates throw the bodies into a ditch. The 54th CT lost half their number in the attack. President Lincoln authorized more colored troops. Fort Wagner was never take by the Union troops.

This movie recreates some battles of the Civil War like a You Are There story. I wonder if the attitudes of those troops was different from what was shown here? After the war General Longstreet wrote an article advising against any attack of infantry by a bayonet charge against fortified guns. WW I generals did not take this advice. The invention of airplanes (flying artillery or cavalry) avoided problems in later wars. Armored vehicles allowed outflanking a defense line. Battles are never won until your troops boots are on the ground.",1423440000,,2836,4.805327868852459
