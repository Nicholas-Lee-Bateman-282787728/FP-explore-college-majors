4400614,5,B004L9GLM2,"The final (and arguably best) installment of this groundbreaking television series.
Strife with intelligent commentary on a broad range of subjects from the ever changing American business environment (and work ethic of todays youth) to the havoc that poverty can wreak in urban environments.
It should be noted, however, that the material covered by these men may be too ""deep"" for some.
They are simply peasant dunces who will never understand.",1306195200,4,446,5.295774647887324

4400616,1,B004L9GLM2,"How to express how unfunny these guys are? It's impossible, they have a lot of ackward sketches that look like something that would turn out to be funny but the laughs never come. It's just odd, almost like stuff from Dumb and Dumber but without the payoff. How this stays on the air and how they get bigger actors on their show I'll never know. I wish I had their luck.",1305417600,9,370,4.225352112676056
4400617,4,B004L9GLM2,"This was probably the most hit-or-miss (and darkest) season.  However, now that I revisit it on iTunes, I realize just how many belly laughs there are, here.  (I purchased it on iTunes, but really value the insane DVD cover art and ease of use of popping a disc into the TV rather than hooking up my computer to the TV just to watch Tim and Eric.)  Obviously, noone would really consider this unless they are already a huge fan.  In case you've forgotten, this season includes the following:
-An SNL-esque opening sequence
-A diarrhea prevention device resembling a drain plug on a chain
-""Quall of Duty"" teaser, involving the use of a Liebe Hart puppet painted up like a ho to bust johns
-""Stunt Men"" epsiode, a perversion of women's television (something akin to The View, HSN, or a makeup infomerical)
-Tairy Green Machine epsiode, where Zach Galiafinakis erupts at his dance students, ""You make me want to do cocaine off a vertical mirror!""  Also features guest stars Levar Burton and Ted Danson.

Note:  This disc apparently contains the episode, ""Lucky"", in which the Pierre bit is taken too far.  I did not like this part and not surprisingly, it was removed from the iTunes store shortly after its release.  (Seems to have been restored recently.)  This episode should be pre-screened with headphones before showing to company.",1301011200,3,1335,4.841409691629956

Tim and Eric isn't for everyone... and even being a huge fan, not every skit resonates with me... but the ones they do I STILL find hysterical even after watching dozens of time.  I would definitely check out some YouTube videos of this before purchasing... they will either lead you to buying the whole series or steering clear completely.  If you like comedy like Monty Python or Kids in the Hall... you might appreciate Tim and Eric.",1392854400,,488,4.586206896551724

4400639,5,B004L9GLM2,The show is awesome but only for fans of bizarre uncomfortable humor.  The whole show is chock full of great cameos too.  Check out the Crows episode where crows pluck out Tim & Eric's eyes and they get an extra special punishment from the Dark Lord played by Marilyn Manson!,1319414400,2,275,4.48
4400640,2,B004L9GLM2,"they finally came full circle and stopped being funny?
jokes about jokes made in prior seasons, mostly the grossest and childish blends of humor they must have thought fans wanted. either that, or they really did run out of funny-juice. in an attempt to be more shocking than ever before, they've become a real bore on this season. too bad because i thought most seasons prior to this were insanely genius and that they were about to undermine everything that is television, hollywood, and DIY special effects.

RIP balls insurance",1316736000,3,531,4.9
4400641,2,B004L9GLM2,"Okay, I know I'll probably get a ton of hate for this, but guys, this was quite possibly the worst season of Tim and Eric ever. I'm a huge fan of seasons 2 and 3. Season Cinco just didn't deliver on the laughs as much as the past ones. They were so creative and original before, but this season seriously just rehashed past jokes but with less vigor and creativity. It didn't even seem like they were having fun. They really were grasping for straws this season and they were trying WAY too hard, but there are still some great moments. Very hit or miss, which is what I expect from Tim and Eric, but the laughs just didn't come and the speed they did in past seasons. There were seriously whole episodes where I would barely crack a chuckle. I love the show to death, I really do, but this season just didn't do it for me. I wanted to like it, I really wanted to, but demmit it just didn't work!

Best moments:

iJammer
Morning Meditations
Feminine Perspectives (an example of what Tim and Eric can do when they hit that sweet spot)

4400643,5,B004L9GLM2,"More of the brilliantly random Tim and Eric humor.  Keeps on par with the hilarity of the previous seasons, and a must for any fan.  Only cons are that I almost puked the first time I watched it and the disc is boring compared to the ""art"" of the previous seasons'.",1310169600,,265,4.176470588235294
4400644,5,B004L9GLM2,Season 5 like all the rest is epically awesome! Highly recommended for any Tim & Eric fan out there. Buy it!!!,1308787200,,110,4.285714285714286

4400646,5,B004L9GLM2,"I feel that it may be a bit unnecessary typing a review but at any rate, Season Cinco delivers hilarity per usual.

If you've come this far and still hate Tim and Eric, I admire your persistence.

Me me, I'm a Cinco-man!",1307923200,,220,4.214285714285714
4400647,5,B004L9GLM2,"It's amazing to me that, some six-ish years after T&E made their national debut in the form of Tom Goes to the Mayor, there are still people so angry that they don't get the joke... to the point of spending their time going online to trumpet their hatred from the highest available mountain, reviewing products they have never purchased and almost certainly never watched. It reminds me a lot of the response the composer John Cage's work seems to get all these decades on. Tell a group of young musicians about works Cage put out some sixty years ago, and about half of them will still become blisteringly angry like it was still 1952. T&E's work seems to have this effect on people too; like Cage challenging the nature of music, I think T&E at least poke around the question of what can / should be considered funny, and this makes some people extremely upset.

Anyway, I've been a huge fan of Tim and Eric since Tom Goes to the Mayor. The comparatively understated TGTTM was much more consistent; I find Awesome Show to be hit and miss at times (although I can forgive them as I still love most of it). Season Cinco, the final foreseeable season of the Awesome Show for the moment, was their best and most consistent season overall in my opinion. Some of the best gags of the entire Awesome Show series are found here, and the ""Greene Machine"" episode is nothing short of an 11-minute masterwork that I never get tired of watching. (How on earth did they ever talk Peter Cetera into doing Awesome Show?!)

Cinco is also the most challenging, in that the gross-outs / creep-outs are frequently more over-the-top than in previous seasons, and recurrent jokes / characters from earlier seasons are used in such a way that newbies won't have a clue what's going on during certain segments. This is a season that they obviously made for themselves and their fans first and foremost.

If you wanted to check out Tim and Eric for the first time, I would recommend starting with the first 2-3 seasons of Awesome Show... or perhaps Tom Goes to the Mayor like I did, although that show demonstrates a different, arguably more ""mature"" side of T&E's comedy. Like those? Move safely, directly on to Season Cinco.

Be aware that where ""getting"" Awesome Show in particular is concerned, it helps (greatly!) to be a child of the 80s. You might want to also pay careful attention to Davin Wood's musical contributions in all seasons of Awesome Show; as far as I'm concerned, he should get top billing along with Tim and Eric, because so much of Awesome Show's comedic effectiveness relies on his musical contributions.",1307664000,2,2606,4.671023965141612
