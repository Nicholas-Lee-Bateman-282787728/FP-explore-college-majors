8338545,4,B001RPZE08,I saw this maybe ten years ago on TV and it's stuck in my head ever since. A great mix of opera scenes and 'real life' docu drama. If you want a piece of art that shows opera being gritty and contemporary rather than effete boring tosh for posh people then this film does it in spades.,1338163200,3,285,4.017543859649122
8338546,1,B001RPZE08,"If I would have known it was this graphic with violence, blood, and a lot of frontal nudity(no actual sex scenes, just really seedy), I wouldn't have bought it.

The story line is basically Thomas Allen's belief that Cassanova was the real-life inspiration for Don Giovanni.  He follows the footsteps of Cassanova to present his evidence.  Allen throws himself into the role of Don Giovanni so much that he goes on the prowl for prostitutes, they end up in a grave yard, girls screaming, etc.  It opens with a girl witnessing the beating death of her father in the streets of Prague.  This is captured on a street camera used by the police.  The street camera thing is disturbing - as well as the fake, (Central European News with the American anchor lady), newscast showing the very bloody corpse of her dad.  Allen keeps a video journal, so you are treated to a ""home movie"" effect showing a variety naked girls and a man - his ""conquests"" in order to fully experience what it would be like to be Cassanova.  This DVD gets a 1 star rating, (it was 2, but I thought about it some more), because I just can't get over the graphic, almost pornographic nature of this DVD.  Cassanova was racy, so I get the plot; but did they have almost glorify violence, blood, and not good sex? I'm no prood, but the subject could have been presented in a less seedy fashion.

It's not entirely bad, he puts in a good perfomance when they actually do the opera.  He tells a good story.  But I would be embarrassed to show this to anyone in my home. He could have chosen a better way to present this. Allen, in my mind, changes the opera and drags it through the seedier side of Prague.

I wish they had a good description on Amazon and a video preview of this.  I wasted my money.",1306627200,3,1764,4.387692307692308
