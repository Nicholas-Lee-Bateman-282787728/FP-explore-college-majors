But that sort of fizzled out and everything else that happened didn't make much sense. Plus the picture quality was horrible and the subtitles were out of synch.",1519776000,,278,4.8125

8324409,1,B000E5KUH4,"Life Size Entertainment is the first company on my brand new DVD label index list. At first I was convinced this must be a bootleg, so bad as the transfer to DVD and so self-made the menu looked. The bonus material lets us know about the expertise of the cinematographer. I couldn't really tell till I glimpsed into the Makin-of: There, and only there, the brief sequences repeated from the movie actually do look nice. I had never seen such an intense case of moir effect before, i.e. with objects which usually aren't prone to exhibit this on film.

But that's not the worst part. At 50 minutes the movie stops into black at a moment, at which you do not immediately realise that this is not part of the movie. For 1 minute and 50 seconds! At the end of which we get to watch a test pattern, a repetition of the beginning of the scene and, alas, it's continuation.

And just because this was so much fun, later on, we will experience another half a minute of repetition, this time without proper warning by a black-out.

The fun takes another turn, when you switch on the comments by the filmmakers. Because they do NOT stop or repeat at these two major bugs. Which means, this bonus audio track continues ever more out of sync, telling us some 2  minutes early what we do not see yet. (Of course, I didn't realise this at first, for I switched on the comments near the end of movie and was bewildered, what utter nonsense they were commenting.)

And yes, it does get worse yet. Now this MAY be the fault of the individual seller and not a common production glidge as the other ones: The disc wouldn't leave the player. I had to buy tools to open the DVD-player. Only to find a sticky ring around the disc's inner hole. The disc simply wouldn't let go of my player's intestines...

Now for the film itself. Well... I can fully comprehend why so many reviewers on this site give this movie the lowest number of stars possible - for the content alone, not the DVD. I myself wouldn't give the movie the very lowest number of stars and only do this because of the manufacturer's utter carelessness. Judging the movie, not the disc, I would give 2 and a half stars. But that's just because I watch a mininum of 500 movies a year and from THAT perspective, there are very much worse movies around in the bottomless pit of sunk stories.

The film mainly suffers from not being able to fully deliver it's hook - (minor spoiler) of two people breaking into other people's homes to live their out of wedlock relationship cycle there, i.e. from first date to sexual encounters and so on. That may sound sort of interesting, and in part indeed it is. But there are other things happening around them, which do not become very clear at the time. Which is distracting as the viewer battles to fully grasp what's going on. The characters aren't really likeable in part because of that. Only very late into the movie you start to realise what may drive them. But as soon as you might start to like them a little bit more, the credits start. The latter of which doesn't feel as bad as it should.",1436572800,,3080,4.421516754850088
8324410,1,B000E5KUH4,"Complete waste of money. This movie serves no purpose. If I knew it was going to be so horrible, I would not have even accepted this movie for FREE.",1393545600,,148,4.137931034482759
8324411,4,B000E5KUH4,"This is not a skin flick. It's a thoughtful, erotic indie film which played at some film festivals in 2005 to favorable reviews. It deservedly won an award for its music. I think of it as a 90 minute episode of Red Shoe Diaries. I wouldn't call it brilliant, but it has depth and atmosphere. It's worth seeing if you have any interest in the psychology of sex and love. Otherwise, it will bore you.

Indie gems like this show up in Prime now and then. You just have to look for them.",1370908800,3,483,4.193548387096774
8324412,1,B000E5KUH4,"Being a fan of independent films, this title caught my at the local rental shop, and after reading the enticing description on the back of the box i decided to give it a try.  Needless to say I walked away from this one very disapointed. The first thing i noticed about this film was the poor quality of sound. I found myself needing to turn the volume up to above 65% just to make out what they were saying, and worse yet there were no subtitle options.  The second disapointment in this film was how confusing it was to understand what is going on.  Ann Lu explains that she did this on purpose to 'challenge' the viewer.  If i wanted this kind of challenge i would have just done a master sudoku puzzle instead of wasting my time with this terrible movie. Dont get me wrong, even though its not what i prefer, i can appreciate an enigmatic film as long as that film still has something to offer to keep me interested and entertained.  This film actualy has no nudity at all in it, which i found kind of cheap considering there is a naked lady on the cover of the DVD jacket.
I guess i don't understand how movies like this make it all the way to a Hollywood Video.  Seriously, give me a camera and some actors and i could guarentee you a better movie than this.  Halfway through the movie the screen goes blank and colorful bars pop onto the screen along with an anoying high pitched tone -- I'm not kidding -- similar to a emergancy weather broadcast on TV.  I like to think if i spend my money to watch a dvd, that it was at least watched once by the people who made it in order to take out mistakes like this.  The one redeaming quality of this film is camera work of Neal Fredericks. That being said, don't watch this film, neither erotic, or a thriller, quite frankly it sucks.",1169424000,14,1785,4.257396449704142
