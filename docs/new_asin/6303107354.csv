568798,5,6303107354,"This is a heavy weight film in every little detail. A disillusioned priest in a small village will inquire himself for a lot of issues concerned with the free will, the faith and the eloquent silence of God, the coldness of living doing without about God's belief.

This film is specially recommended for Bergman's buffs, but I would like to remind in a film of Robert Bresson : Dairy of a country priest. Watch first this last one film and please go for Winter light. You will find more similarities that you ever know.

A challenging artwork that will dare you due its punching feature. This is the second film of the celebrate Trylogy initiated with through a glass darkly and eventually would culminate with The Silence.",1111536000,,724,4.692913385826771
568799,5,6303107354,"""Winter Light"" follows ""Through a Glass Darkly"" in Ingmar Bergman's ""faith trilogy"" and was followed by ""The Silence.""  Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand portrays a pastor in a small Swedish village; the film follows his crises on one bleak mid-winter afternoon.  He's confronted by his mistress (Ingrid Thulin) as well as a struggling parishioner (Max von Sydow); however, his ultimate confrontation involves his own faith, which had been severely tested by the loss of his beloved wife.

Bergman wrote the screenplay for ""Winter Light,"" which is at times absolutely devastating.  The film is perhaps Bergman's most overtly religious one, and it's an obtuse movie experience in many ways.  However, even though the dramas experienced by the main characters largely involve religion, the film isn't intended for exclusively religious audiences.  In fact, atheists will probably find as much to admire about the film - of course their interpretation is likely to be vastly different, which demonstrates Bergman's extraordinary writing skill.

Every aspect of ""Winter Light"" is superlative.  Bergman's direction is particularly extraordinary - each scene is composed with such care and detail.  In a memorable scene, Thulin reads a letter while the camera remains on her stark face - an absolutely riveting moment.  The film's cinematographer, by the legendary Sven Nykvist, looks surprisingly unpolished, but it adeptly conveys the bleak and austere world of these characters.  The casting and acting is also ideal.  Bjornstrand starred in many Bergman films, but this one contains perhaps his best role and performance.  Ingrid Thulin is another Bergman favorite, and her icy persona is put to perfect effect as the independent but needy schoolteacher who pursues Bjornstrand.  ""Winter Light"" doesn't generally receive as much attention as many other Bergman films, which is a shame because it's a nearly perfect film.  Most highly recommended.

DVD extras: The DVD contains the original US trailer, which surprisingly gives away a major plot detail.  In addition, a nine-minute conversation with Bergman scholar Peter Cowie is included.  He discusses the film in the context of the ""faith trilogy"" as well as other key aspects of ""Winter Light.""",1094256000,2,2236,5.450581395348837
568800,4,6303107354,"This introspective film acutely addresses the tension between faith and reason. The very first scene suggests an equivalence between a person's faith and his or her involvement in ritual: pastor Tomas, in the middle of a spiritual crisis, conducts a service without much conviction. Later, Bergman will show us that only a man who has faith (the disabled church employee) can give liturgy all of its meaning. This parallel can also be extended to the main cause of Tomas' crisis: God's silence. It is this same silence that feeds the faith of that other man. While the film initially appears to emphasize the futility of faith (especially during the first church service and Tomas' ensuing conversations with his mistress and the fisherman), careful viewing points to the contrary: it is when Tomas abjures his faith that his already unstable situation deteriorates - his understated reaction to the fisherman's suicide is all the more startling since this event's consequences will prove to be crucial. And it is when Tomas listens to the employee late in the film that he finds the force to conduct a service even though no one attends it; he is conducting it for himself as a further step in his ongoing spiritual quest.",1081209600,7,1223,4.941747572815534
568801,3,6303107354,"the word 'gray' definitely comes to mind.  this film has a very bleak feel to it and although appropriate for the subject matter i wasn't a huge fan.

568802,4,6303107354,"I saw Winter Light in an ""art"" theater when it first played in the U.S.  What I remember best about it was the absolutely stunning black-and-white cinematography!  The image on the big screen was sparkling crisp and clear and the light on the snow and the rushing white water of the river almost hurt one's eyes!  It was a beautiful job of film photography.  I haven't seen this movie on TV or video, but I know that on a small screen this effect would be lost and only the story would be left.
And the story is a typical Bergman tale of nihilism, in this case a small village parish priest has lost most of his congregation and his own faith, and is unable to deal with his own problems, let alone those of his flock.  But he still carries on, an empty shell unwilling to leave the church and face the world, or the love of the woman who cares for him.  Winter Light is remarkable mostly for the outstanding filmwork by cinematographer Sven Nykvist.  Still, I'd like to see it again if and when it becomes available on DVD.",991267200,4,1024,4.329842931937173
568803,4,6303107354,"For the most part I enjoyed this movie as it raises  many interesting questions concerning the  human existence and our at times, helplessness. The questions of faith, hope and the meaning of life are addressed and the viewer is left to ponder the meanings, as it seems the main character, pastor Thomas, has few answers. The story evolves around the widowed pastor Thomas, his small congregation which includes a woman named Marta, who is determined to be his new woman. Marta is on a quest, Thomas has self doubts about his life and whether or not God is a benevolent being who has the answers or if he is manifesting them through him. The movie seems to take an anti-war stance and the  religious ramifications are always presented, metaphysical questions abound. At one point the pastor addresses a frightened congregation members  concern over the A-bomb and China and he replies ""we're all haunted by the same fears, we must trust God."" The problem is he has many doubts. He's a bit a hypocrite who is insecure possibly because of the loss of his wife. Marta, who is non-christian , loves the pastor but sees him as nuerotic and obsesssed and feels he is indifferent to Christ. The pastor has many issues to deal with including the suicide of a congregation member. The drama acted out for the three hour time period in the movie is pretty amazing. It starts slow, building eventuallly to the point where the viewer is amazed that so little time as passed in the story, it seems like it should have been a longerspan of time . Considering the time period that the film was made in, the height of the cold war, this piece of celluloid does take a stance but the metaphysical questions dominate the theme of the movie. When it is  over the affirmation of our own human frailities are more clearly evident. The movie is short, by todays standards anyway, and holds your interest long enough to see the Pastor Thomas in oneself and all humans. Although part of trilogy, the work stands alone quite nicely.",982627200,,2007,4.65819209039548
568804,5,6303107354,"Few people are familiar with this Bergman film--""Wild Strawberries,"" ""The Seventh Seal,"" and ""Persona"" are better known--but this may very well be his best. The action takes place essentially in real time over just several hours on a winter afternoon, and every note is hit perfectly. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is superb, and the soundtrack (which, as I remember it, has no music at all) is devised to fit the atmosphere perfectly (in particular, the rushing stream in the suicide scene).
There really is no one better than Bergman in addressing serious metaphysical issues while maintaining a sense of the mystery and ambiguity of human existence (except for Kieslowski, whose ""Decalogue"" and ""Red/White/Blue"" trilogy make an interesting counterpoint to Bergman's trilogy of ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" ""Winter Light,"" and ""The Silence""). The film leaves many questions unanswered but affects the viewer long after it has been seen. Immensely depressing on the surface, it somehow confirms the value of human experience while at the same denying it.",974246400,11,1052,5.381818181818182
568805,5,6303107354,"This movie is relentlessly concentrated, uncompromising and beautiful.  It's paced slowly at the beginning, drawing the viewer in, but repays the effort you put in (and it's pretty short).
The story focuses on a  disillusioned priest in a remote village who is unable to accept the love  offered him by Marta, his friend, and unable to offer the conviction of his  faith to save a fisherman from suicide.  There are several hidden  references to the crucifixion:  the time covered in the movie (noon to 3  pm) is the same as the time Jesus spent on the cross;  the location of  Marta's skin disease corresponds to the ""stigmata"" or wounds from  the nails.
I can't recommend this film strongly enough.  Every time I  see it I am stunned by the beauty and meaning in every single frame.",964224000,6,784,4.676470588235294
568857,5,6303107354,"NATTVARDSGAESTERNA (""The Communicants"", given the odd title ""Winter Light"" in English) was released in 1962 and is the second of Ingmar Bergman's ""chamber films"", a trilogy of separate efforts all marked by streamlined plots and a small cast exploring religious faith. Note that this film is available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criterion-Collection-box-set/dp/B0000A02TX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criterion Collection box set</a>&nbsp;along with the other two films of the trilogy.

NATTVARDSGAESTERNA is perhaps the smallest Bergman film in scale, taking place only over a single Sunday afternoon. As the film opens, the priest Thomas (Gunnar Bjoernstrand) presides over Sunday services with a meagre congregation. In a bold extended scene, Bergman captures the entire Lutheran liturgy from the ""Lamb of God"" to the dismissal. While the parishioners are mainly bored or distracted, Thomas seems iron-cast in his faith. But subsequent events reveal his tormenting uncertainty on the existence of God and the meaning of life. He proves unable to comfort a parishioner (Max von Sydow) consumed by fear of nuclear war, nor is he able to sustain his long but rocky relationship with the village schoolmarm Marta (Ingrid Thulin).

While the characters experience great pain due to their inability to see God and relate with their fellow human beings, this is not an entirely bleak film. I have always seen an element of reconciliation in the closing shots, the one time in Bergman's oeuvre where hope is still clearly alive. This was, however, the last time he dealt with religious faith in any overt way. In TYSNADEN (""The Silence""), the last film of the chamber trilogy, any discussion of God is notable by its complete absence. Then, following the chamber trilogy, Bergman shifted his focus dramatically from religious faith to human relationships.

Bergman broke new ground in cinematic storytelling here, and not only in the opening scene. When Thomas reads a letter from Marta, the text is delivered by her in soliloquy, speaking directly to the camera in two long shots. Indoor scenes are driven by dialogue, while in outdoor scenes, reflecting the grim Swedish winter, there is little talking at all.

I consider this Bergman's greatest film not only in its flawless screenplay, but also in the achievements of his collaborators. The acting is superb, with Bjoernstrand giving the most convincing performance of his career. Sven Nykvist's camera work successfully conveys the emotions of the characters and the bleakness of their winter surroundings. The real power of the film to me is evident in that, though I've seen this film several times over the years, the questions it raises still provoke much thought.",1227052800,,2770,5.495305164319249

568859,5,6303107354,"Winter Light (Nattvardsgsterna- literally The Communicants) is the middle film in Ingmar Bergman's Spider Trilogy (as it too references the God as a spider imagery), following Through A Glass Darkly, and preceding The Silence. Made in 1963, it represents a dramatic notching upward from the well made, but often melodramatic and symbolic, Through A Glass Darkly. Where the first film of the trilogy suffers from the overacting of Harriet Andersson, and some over the top displays of incest (for sex is a subject that the cerebral Bergman is at his weakest in handling) Winter Light is simply one of the greatest Socratic dialogues ever put to film, and as close to perfect a screenplay as a mortal is likely to produce. The acting, in every single role, is pitch perfect, yet Bergman regular Ingrid Thulin gives one of the great dominant female performances in film history, as Mrta Lundberg, an atheistic substitute school teacher in a small town with a now unrequited love for a Lutheran Pastor named Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bjrnstrand), head of a church whose congregation has dwindled to a handful. The gorgeous Thulin is at her frumpiest and dowdiest looking in this film, and it seems that after an illness, she lost the affection of Tomas, with whom she had lived with for two years.
Even Tomas does not believe any longer. His is a rote life, ever since the death of his wife four years earlier. He gives communion to a congregation that is bored- a boy licks the pews, others try to stay awake- including the church organist who checks his watch and reads, and the church hierarchy is dominated by money hungry apparatchiks, and Mrta's swooning over Tomas is part of local gossip, which discomfits him. As he ends his noontime ceremony he is confronted by a fisherman, Jonas Persson (Max Von Sydow in a curly permanent wave) and his wife Karin (Gunnel Lindblom). The man is suffering from depression, ostensibly over the Chinese getting the atomic bomb. Of course, this is just a pretense, for we know Jonas is an unemployed fisherman, with three children and a fourth on the way, and even in the 1960s people were not so detached from reality to off themselves over an abstraction. Wisely, Bergman never reveals his true fears, as Tomas brushes him off and tells him to come back later, for a man to man talk. The Perssons leave, and then Tomas reads a letter Mrta wrote him, confessing her love. It is a brilliant scene, shot with Thulin reading the words in two long takes, interspersed with a brief flashback. She addresses the camera so comfortably yet frankly that it puts the viewer in the place of Tomas, and we can later identify with his discomfit around this sincere, but needy and not altogether `there' woman, who has suffered from a variety of ills which she feels had led Tomas to be repulsed by her. Yet, we are also drawn to her by the quiet brilliance with which she utterly guts religion with her atheistic views.
  Bergman, apparently, has always stated that this was his only perfectly realized film, and while others may add to that number, there is no denying the excellence of this filmic masterwork, which shows that while Bergman had his roots in the theater, he also knew exactly how to use the filmic medium. The original Swedish title, as The Communicants, would seem to be better title for this film, which deals with connections and communications, and their fragility. While Through A Glass Darkly deals with people on an island, this aloneness is handled even more deftly here, where winter seems to be the defining metaphor- whether as the winter of religiosity or human kindness. Winter Light ranks with Wild Strawberries and Shame as one of Bergman's greatest works, which makes them essentials as films. It does not indulge in the technical masturbation of some later works, not does it rely too much on stagy overacting, as it deftly balances the inner and outer worlds of film and life. It is a truly great work of art.",1222214400,3,3966,4.771470160116448
568860,4,6303107354,"I do not believe that there is a human being out there that at some point did not question the existance of God. Regardless if one believes in God or not, there is always a question about (un)certainty of his existance.  What makes this film remarkable is that Ingmar Bergman is having a small town minister loosing faith.  His own doubt is so intense, that even his parishiners seem to sense that something is off.  As a result, only a few attend his masses and those few are desparate in their loneliness, depression and sadness.  They are seeking some consolation in the church and their pastor is unable to provide them with because he is having his own doubts. His trouble comes from the fact that he has lost his wife five years ago and cannot get over her death.  Her life and being was his sole happiness and without her presence and reassurance he is completely lost.  Even his two year romance with the local school teacher is  not bringing him any relief from grief; he has no hope as God is simply not responding to his prayers any more.  The priest is dead spiritually and he is a shadow of himself; he has no compassion for his (former) lover and is not capable of empathy for his parishiners.  His inability to help leads one of his parishiners to commit suicide.  But, he is true to his vocation, so no matter how many people do show or do not show for the mass, he prays to God because the show must go on.  It is a show because the priest does not have an ounce of humanity left in him.  He is a shadow of his former self dwindling slowly towards his own old age and death.  He is completely and utterly alone not because everyone has deserted him , but because he chooses so.",1222041600,,1694,4.322784810126582
568861,5,6303107354,"At one point in this best of all Bergman films, the despairing pastor Tomas (Gunnar Bjornstrand) realizes that life would be comprehensible if there is no God.  All the paradoxes and dilemmas of faith would vanish, and evil, revealed to be meaningless and nonpurposeful, would at least no longer be mysterious.  This realization immediately leads into Tomas' final loss of the last shreds of his faith.  The silence of God which has been tormenting him is at least seen to be a necessary silence, and that realization gives him a momentary sense of liberation.

But it also leads to a troubling existential quandary:  when God goes silent, once and for all, how does one lead one's life?  How can broken, lonely, and frightened people make meaningful contact with one another?  How can long-held habits of relying on what Tomas comes to call an ""echo God""--an imagined deity who tells you exactly what you want to hear--be broken?  How does one manage not, as Marta says, to ""hate yourself to death""?

Bergman's ""Winter Light"" is an exploration of these questions (and surely is as autobiographical as it is philosophical).  There are no definitive answers here.  A life liberated by God's silence is still a life full of ambiguity and suffering, disappointment and unfulfillment.  The silence of God--of ultimate meaning and purposefulness to the universe--is still a Christ-like passion many of us must endure in our own Gethsemanes.  But the end of ""Winter Light,"" with Tomas acknowledging the hear-and-now presence of Marta, offers some hope, filtered even as it is through the winter light of a new and godless world.

This is a very personal and important for Bergman film for it deals with the loss of Faith - the master was very proud of this work. Bergman, aided by his regular cinematographer Sven Nykvist and performances by Gunnar Bjornstrand, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnel Lindblom and Max von Sydow had created a compelling, tragic, and thought-provoking film about a village priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who can't give much comfort and hope to those who need them as he feels none for himself.

It lacks the cinematic dazzle of ""Persona"" (1966) and the obvious turmoils of ""Fanny and Alexander"" (1982). Instead, this is a quiet, beautifully staged and photographed story of one Sunday afternoon, three hours, in the life of a Lutheran pastor, his mistress, and his congregants. Still grieving the death of his beloved wife, sick, and having arrived at middle-aged burn-out, the pastor feels his faith has gone and his calling, a sham. He pushes away the love of a woman who, herself, is not whole. He muddles through as best he can, and Bergman invites us to join him (and ourselves, at certain moments in our lives).

It's interesting that in both ""Through a Glass"" and this one, Bergman takes you to a cliff, pushes you over but then throws a rope down right at the end. It was a much more credible gesture in ""Winter Light""  quite moving in its stoicism and resonating so strongly with me in late middle age, where you really must make that choice between shriveling up and blowing away or carrying on, despite all doubts.

He's unable to accept the love offered him by the plain school teacher Marta (Ingrid Thulin, also very good), and incapable to offer the conviction of his faith to save from suicide a fisherman called Jonas (Max von Sydow) troubled by the prospect of a nuclear war(incidentally, this was filmed just before the Cuban missile crisis).

This must have been a very personal film by Bergman (the son of a stern Lutheran priest, the director lost his religious faith as a young man). There are a lot of biblical allusions and religious discussions (we have a doubting Thomas, a fisherman called Jonas). One can nitpick here and there (one could wonder why the younger Marta is so attracted to the middle aged, aloof Thomas, or whether Jonas motivation to kill himself is credible), but if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, the minimalist direction and the great acting made for a powerful movie. Reportedly this was Ingmar Bergman choice as the favorite film he made.",1397865600,,1207,5.065326633165829

7838628,4,6303107354,"On first viewing I was less affected by this than by `Through a Glass Darkly', which opens the trilogy, though a number of critics
rank it higher, and a couple call it one of the greatest films ever made.  So I owe it a re-see.

Certainly, once again the acting is terrific, and the cinematography superb.  More even than `Through a Glass Darkly' this film mines
the subtle shadings of the human face to an almost supernatural degree.

But this film returns to Bergman's early tendency to be very on-the-nose with his themes.  Here it's the story itself.  A pastor has
lost his faith, in the face of God's silence at the dark things of life.  But in this story, just about everyone has surrendered to that
sort of hopeless depression, so the film feels more one note, more talky and `heady' than `Through a Glass Darkly', if more quiet
and subtle in its approach than the early Bergman works.

It's not just that the characters don't change that bothers me, its that it feels clear from the outset there is no hope of change, which
made me feel I'd already gotten the power of the film's questioning and aching loss (which is still considerable) long before its final moments.

None-the-less, how rewarding to see any film that is about the big questions, and addresses them in a serious, beautifully made way.
And I do find it haunting me since I've seen it.",1334966400,,1359,4.559670781893004
7838629,5,6303107354,"I have been steadily becoming a huge Ingmar Bergman fan, and my adoration for him grows with almost every new film I see of his.  With `Nattvardsgasterna' (or `Winter Light' for us English speakers) he has turned that adoration into full blown love.  The film is delightfully simple yet undeniably profound.  Bergman effortlessly delivers to us a remarkable tale of faith (or lack thereof) and the heavy weight that it can bring down on a person.

The film takes place over a single day, in between a morning and an evening sermon.  Tomas Ericsson, the Pastor at a small (and rapidly dwindling) church is battling his own inner demons (his faith is a subject of major debate) but he is still called upon by a local parishioner who feels as though his anxieties have gotten the better of him.  Fearing a nuclear holocaust will befall him, he craves to end his life.  Unable to help him, Ericsson is soon troubled by knowledge that this young man did indeed take his life, causing the Pastor to confront his internal struggles head on in the films brilliant second half.

Not only is the Pastor dealing with his personal relationship with God, but he has to contend with the affections of the local schoolteacher, Marta Lundberg.  His relationship with Marta is complicated (there love is a bitter one), and this is brought to a head as they confront each others feelings head on.

Their final confrontation is as brutal as they come.

The performances here really make this film a must see.  Both Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Bjornstrand are flawless, captivating the audience by creating two very human portraits.  It has been stated that Bjornstrand in particular loathed the character of Tomas, but I feel that it was in that loathing that this tremendous tour-de-force was born.  You can see the struggle on his face to accept who he is, and that struggle is not forced but a very real interpretation.  Perhaps it is the depiction of Gunnar's own struggle with accepting this character, but the turmoil that is present is beyond words.  Thulin is also a force here as the conflicted and confused Marta.  Her desires for Tomas are destroying her internally, and she wears that very well.

Like I said, their final confrontation is devastating.

I want to also make a quick mention of Max von Sydow, who is all sorts of phenomenal here.  He barely says a word, yet his performance is unforgettable.  Such a rich and truly emotionally gut-wrenching portrayal of personal abandonment.

The film may be simple as far as actual plot points are concerned, but the emotional gamut runs very deep here.  The subject of faith is attacked head on in a very subtle yet powerful manor.  As Tomas battles his own hypocrisy we, the audience, are given the opportunity to relate (and yes, we can relate) to his plight.  Religion is a huge part of life, but who has not at one time or another begun to doubt our faith?  Bergman portrays that human struggle for closure masterfully here.  There are few films so honest they make us ashamed of our feelings.  This is one of those kinds of films.",1241049600,2,3075,4.707865168539326
7838630,5,6303107354,"WINTER LIGHT:  It's cold and neutral; the kind of light that neither hides nor flatters anything, nor permits the perception of anything to be distorted by mist or illusion.  Its the lgiht of analysis that burns sentiment away, leaving nothing behind.

This short, powerful film is like that.  It briefly and tersely examines the life and faith of a country pastor living in rural Sweden during the fifties; that is, precisely, in the new Atomic Age, when the threat of the spread of atomic warfare frightened the Europe-dominated world.  Indeed, one of the film's few characters in this spare story is driven to despair and suicide by the threat of the Chinese, armed with such weapons, sweeping over the face of the earth.  A people, he says, ""Who have nothing to lose.""

A people with nothign to lose is afraid of nothing, therefore it follows that a people with everything to lose is afraid of everything.  For the timid, security is overturned at every hand by Nihilism.  But sentient reality is determined at least in part, by fear, is it not?  Traditional belief depends on one's fear of god and the ghastly punishments he threatens.  But modern or Existential philosophy arises from our fear of everything but god, and god, starved of our dread, withers and dies, therefore, in and of our indifference.

This is an unusual film of great simplicity and beauty.  It does not preach at all -- though its central figure is a preacher -- rather, through him is demonstrated the ineffectuality, the uselessness of preaching; certainly of preaching any sentiment no matter how noble, that one does not feel.

Here, Bergman's usual handfull of actors, all very good, and a screenplay of stupendous courage, nobility and intelligence.  Not, perhaps, a bowl of popcorn and a sixpak kind of movie, but eminently worth watching -- and wathcing more than once or twice -- if only because one must try to imagine a plane of existence somewhere, anywhere beyond today's twin poles of lifetime gluttony and eventual gastric bypass surgery; a plane where ethical concerns outweigh superficialities.",1236384000,,2089,4.945558739255015
