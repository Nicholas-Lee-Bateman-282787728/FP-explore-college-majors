4020669,2,B002ZG97RY,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!

Again I'll ask what was the point of this movie. I think the point of this movie was to make left wing people in Hollywood and around the United States feel better about themselves. There was no other point to this movie, the story was average and predictable at best, the acting was robot like, the directing was just bad. The only really good thing about this movie were the action and visuals. I'm going to say the same thing about about Green Zone I said about Avatar. Great action and visuals do not make a good movie.

Now you Obama lovers and left wing democrats calm down. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I have no party, and I really hate the way the political system works right now. All this movie does is point out facts most people should already know. The Bush administration lied to use about there being and active Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, just like they lied about the terrorists from 911 being from there, when in fact most of them were from Saudi Arabia. Most people should already know this. Just like everybody should know Saddam Hussein was a terrible man who killed millions of his own people, and his government should have been overthrown. Hell back in the Gulf War we should have gotten ride of him then. The people of Iraq are better off without him in the long run. Most people out there should already know this, so again what was the point of this movie. Oh yes I forgot about the movie.

The story I shouldn't even have to go into. It's about the search for WMD's, and not finding any. The writers didn't care about the characters only the story, and it was still bad. The only good side to this story was that the writers tried to show the Iraqis perspective, which I did enjoy. It just wasn't enough to make this a good movie.

The acting was terrible and robot like. Matt Damon
was essentially Jason Bourne, and the movie kind of felt like a bad Bourne movie. The other American actors(Greg Kinnear, Amy Ryan, Brendan Gleeson and others) were like robots spouting off their lines. The only characters I actually felt for were the Iraq ones especially Freddy(Khalid Abdalla). His acting and character stole the movie for me.

The directing by Paul Greengrass was just plain bad. It was like he was directing a bad Jason Bourne movie.

Finally the action and special effects, the only good thing about this movie. They were admittedly good and riveting. The only problem is that you just don't care about any of the characters and who lives or dies.

Hollywood needs to stop making movies on Iraq, they suck at it. Stop standing on your soap box and come down to the rest of us. There are plenty of other issues and wars you could make movies about. For example I would love to see a movie about WWI. I know WWII is the popular war to make movies about, but I think making movie based on WWI would be good and a change of passe.

Now if you want to see good movies about Iraq, I would suggest only two. The first is Hurt Locker, and the second is Three Kings. Those two movies are truly great and worth watching.",1268352000,7,3080,4.419753086419753
4020670,5,B002ZG97RY,"Yeah - I know it seems cheesy but the first thing I thought of when I saw this film were the words spoken by Barbara Stanwyck in the Big Valley television series.  Cortez, when dealing with the Aztecs was appalled by the human sacrifice they practiced, one of the first moves made by Cortez after he took control was to release these folks so that they could go back to their families in peace.  Seems perfectly rational by our standards even today, however, all 500+ committed suicide because they were not being allowed to become one with their Gods.  Hard for us to understand, but this was their reality and Cortez failed to understand that.
This film does a beautiful job of telling the story, without taking sides, of what happened in Iraq after the initial invasion.  It shows how little we understood, and perhaps still do not understand the people we are trying to deal with there.  Some of the action maybe hard to follow if you do not know a good bit about the background.  The film demonstrates how many Americans that went there with good intentions and huge amounts of energy became disillusioned because it became clear very quickly that we acted on false information.  The main character - played by Matt Damon moves through the maze of misinformation trying to get at the truth.  The point at which the truth hits him full in the face comes from a very unexpected source and the simple statement towards the end of the film -- ""YOU do not get to decide what happens here!""
The arrogance that we have displayed to date has played into the hands of those trying to bring about our demise, we must begin to display better judgement, and wisdom.  Seek to understand the motivating factors so that we can be smarter than those working against us and use those motivations in our favor.  This film goes a LONG way towards filling in the gaps for the American people so that they can grasp some of the Iraqi realities.
I was in Iraq back in the 1970's and when I heard all of the rhetoric concerning the proposed invasion, I thought that these folks MUST know something I do not.  Despite the fact that the existing regime was obviously bad, and had in and of itself been created by the United States (Sadam was put there by previous administrations) I could not see what the plan was for brining this country together once it was torn apart.  This film accurately shows that there in fact was no plan, and perhaps still there is no direction for how to unite a country that is made up of tribal elements.  See this film to understand a lot of why we are currently in the mess we are in.  We have GOT to begin to think outside the box, and turn this thing around.",1268352000,9,2673,4.462012320328542

We have recently been on a Matt Damon-athon, and this is one that I hadn't seen.  I enjoy him in these war/ soldier type rolls.  He is very intense and has a fantastic ability to portray tension and danger in a very believable way.
This movie didn't let me down.  Matt Damon was top notch and the story terribly realistic and believable.  I cannot begin to say I have any idea of the actions behind the scenes of wars.  I am not a conspiracy theorist, by any means, but I do believe that there are plenty actions of which we are completely unaware as a people.  Perhaps Hollywood makes situations fantastical, but they do offer a glimpse into a world that most of us will never know.

I am not a super movie buff, or a soldier.  I know that even stories based on some element of truth are full of fabrication and exaggeration.  Regardless, I enjoyed the story, the acting, and the movie in general.  I watch these movies to escape my own reality.  This provided that escape.

But believe that President Clinton and a littany of his cabinet members issued the first warnings of Saddam's WMDs and you'll find those as lacking here as any mention of Saddam's WMD gassing of the Kurds, any invasion of Kuwait, Saddam's violation of 16 U.N. Security Council Resolutions, the U.N.'s authorization for America to act, the international coalition of 30+ nations, or Congress's bipartisan and near unanimous authorization for the use of force. In short: this otherwise decent action flick is ultimately unsatisfying for its fundamental and partisan rewriting of history.

Unfortunately, this film lacked any of the depth of the Bourne trilogy; the one dimensional characters made predicting who-was-up-to-what disappointingly easy. The hand-held camera live documentary style is perhaps getting a little old - it worked very well in Blackhawk Down but it was overused here and became intrusive.

It was still, however, an entertaining film with Matt Damon doing what he does best and, perhaps, it isn't fair to compare it to the Bournes. It was interesting to see a big Hollywood film showing the American administration in such a poor light - most refreshing.

4022189,1,B002ZG97RY,"Where to begin.  Unrealistic, and not remotely based in fact.  Matt Damon's character captures an important Saddam loyalist, and states very seriously ""Maybe this guy knows where to find the WMD.""  Cartoonish from start to finish.

Damon then meets with Iraqi General Ayad al-Rawi (played masterfully by Igal Naor) in order to convince al-Rawi to return with Damon to ""bring the truth that Iraq had no WMD.""  Preposterous -- al-Rawi would slit Damon's throat in a second, and the claims of one general must be weighed against the claims of hundreds of other generals, every international intelligence agency, and also the United Nations itself (including Hans Blix).

The film plays on the false premise that: 1) the world had to prove Saddam had WMD, and 2) that WMD was the sole reason for war.  Both are false.  The burden of proof rested with Saddam, who had to prove Iraq destroyed thousands of tons of WMD, but Saddam refused to do so, right to the end (as Chief UN Weapons Inspector Hans Blix stated to the UN Security Council in January 2003)...

""I have mentioned the issue of anthrax to the Council on previous occasions and I come back to it as it is an important one. Iraq has declared that it produced about 8,500 litres of this biological warfare agent, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991.  Iraq has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared, and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date.  It might still exist.  Either it should be found and be destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision or else convincing evidence should be produced to show that it was, indeed, destroyed in 1991.""

""The nerve agent VX is one of the most toxic ever developed.  13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force between 1983 and 1988, while Iraq has declared that 19,500 bombs were consumed during this period.  Thus, there is a discrepancy of 6,500 bombs.  The amount of chemical agent in these bombs would be in the order of about 1,000 tonnes.""

""In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now -- a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed.

 Matt Damon, serious actor/writer and rising action star, is teamed for the third time with director Paul Greengrass.  The pair collaborated on the two most recent of the Bourne movies, Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum.  Both of these ventures were very successful, people gladly exchanged their movie money for the vicarious thrills of watching Jason Bourne work out his problems.  This is not in any way Bourne 4.
 In the Bourne movies, Damon played a spy gone rogue in order to solve a murderous conspiracy involving an evil, off the books faction of the CIA. In Green Zone he plays a rogue soldier who is trying to solve a murderous conspiracy involving an evil White House apparatchik.  In a spectacular twist of Hollywood irony, Damon is aided by a virtuous CIA agent in attempting to thwart the White House bad guy.
 Director Paul Greengrass can put together a gripping and exciting action sequence, but it isn't enough to carry the film.  Writer Brian Helgeland is the pen behind many films from Nightmare on Elm Street 4 to the well reviewed L.A. Confidential.  Green Zone will not be the film that puts Helgeland, at last, into the ranks of blockbuster writers.
 This film is being advertised as a thriller, an action film full of loud noises and colorful explosions.  In reality, it is a political hit piece on the Bush administration.  After viewing interviews show that about one third of the viewers rated the film an A and a similar number rating it as an F.  This is very unusual.  Most films have the ratings bunches.  The body politic is divided in a similar manner between avid supports and staunch detractors of the Bush administration.  The split is more of a rating of particular political views than as a reaction to the actual film, which is middling at best, in spite of the excellent action sequences.  I heard someone say as he left the theater I hope George [President Bush] goes to jail.  This is not what a director wants his public to say.  Something more like Wow, was that great is more appreciated.
 Somehow Hollywood continues to find money, $100,000,000 plus the advertising budget in this case, to make war movies that portray America in a poor and false light.  In a film about the Iraq war it is hard to make money if the most sympathetic character, aside from the star, is an Iraqi patriot, a maimed veteran of the war with Iran, who murders another, unarmed, Iraqi in cold blood.  Poor Greg Kinnear, an actor of depth, is stuck playing the political operative who lied America into war and murdered people who knew the truth.  There is a sloppy journalist who has her eyes fixed firmly on a Pulitzer and not on the truth.  A murderous Iraqi general is portrayed as the last best hope for peace.
 The R rated Green Zone has pulled in only $28 million in seven day of release, world wide.  This movie will be a dead loss for its producers and backers.  I give it a disappointing two saw blades, and that only for the action scenes.  See a date movie this week instead.",1414108800,,3024,4.621013133208256

4022414,4,B002ZG97RY,"Movie fans who like Paul Greengrass's handling of thrilling chase sequences in the Bourne movies that he directed won't be disappointed here.  The last act of the movie follows the pursuit of an Iraqi general by two separate groups -- one that wants him dead and one that doesn't -- and it's quite marvelous how Greengrass keeps the pursuits clear enough in our minds, especially since we are talking about night-time military operations in an urban setting.  There are lots of narrow passages, narrow streets, people dashing in and out of doors -- in fact, remarkably like the kind of thing that I saw in ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" which also featured Matt Damon.  But that movie was pure entertainment: here something is at stake, at least in the minds of the pursuers: nothing less than the future of Iraq, or rather, two competing versions of the future.  Interestingly, the movie isn't simply favoring one of these over the other, as the end of the chase makes clear -- and in the interest of not spoiling that ending, I'll just leave it at that.  But it is the characters' beliefs about what matters that does give weight to the chase, so that it's not an empty thrill.  If it were, the movie could be legitimately be criticized as exploitation.

There's more to the movie than the chase, though.  The first part is about Matt Damon's character, Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller, realizing that the intelligence his troop is working with to enable them to find and secure WMD sites is useless -- and he begins to suspect that he and possibly American policy makers have been deliberately misled.  In the Green Zone, the American HQ in central Baghdad, he finds that a high-level official, Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear, smoothly togged out in civvies) won't listen when he tells him that there seem to be no WMDs.  The official clearly has one eye on pleasing his superiors in Washington and one on keeping the news media believing the WMD story.  He insists that the WMDs are there and that Miller just needs to look harder.  Also in the Green Zone is a CIA officer -- a long time Middle East hand called Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson, all rumpled authenticity) -- who already deeply suspects that there are no WMDs and who is sympathetic to Miller's frustrations.  The movie does a good job in suggesting the contrast between the comfort and seeming efficiency of bureaucracy in the Zone and the chaos in the Baghdad streets and the ugliness in the prisons.  It's possible to see things getting a little schematic here -- the real conflict in the movie isn't between Americans and Iraqis but between bureaucratic American types whose main interest is PR and people whose ears are closer to the ground, like Miller and Brown, who can't see a stable Iraq being built if the reasons for going to war aren't good ones.  As characters, then, the Americans tend to be simply morally categorized to an extent that they are pretty one-dimensional as characters.  Interestingly, the more complicated characters are Iraqi -- Miller's translator Freddy (Khalid Abdalla) and the Iraqi general Al Rawi (Yigal Naor) -- and their parts are very convincingly taken.  However, Damon, Kinnear, Gleeson and Amy Ryan (as a WSJ reporter who has pushed the suspect WMD story as fact) are all fine -- if their characters are flatter, that's how they're written, and the actors work hard to make them credible, and they succeed.

Is the movie just liberal propaganda, as some reviewers who rank it low believe?  I don't think so -- the facts of the origins of the war were beyond partisan dispute by the time this movie was released in 2008.  Obviously, the pushers of the WMD story don't look good, but you don't have to be a political partisan see the damage they did.  The larger question that hangs over the movie is the one of who should be responsible for the reconstruction, supposing that that is achievable -- a question still very much in doubt as I write in 2014.  So --yes, the movie does simplify and flatten some things, but it doesn't trivialize the conflict and the issues, and it is very well made and well acted.",1407456000,,4113,4.723076923076923

In this fictionalized account of our war with Iraq, the story line is: the whole WMD thing was made up and the world was lied to in order to justify the invasion of Iraq.

Despite intelligence sources from many countries - not just the U.S. - we are told that ""Bush lied, people died."" That about sums up the film. Nothing new, no new info, just the same old lie made into a story. Just like the claim they make about the war, the film is also based on a phony premise.

The rest of the film is quite good, as well, although the plot is trite traditional conspiracy theory fiction. This is to say, the fictional hypothetical conspiracy theory of the causes for the second Iraq war, are made to seem quite real, through the skill of the Director, the performance of the Star, Matt Damon, and a fine supporting  cast. I suppose, however, if you take the fictional elements as statements in opposition to your political commitments, your annoyance with those elements of the movie, will detract from your enjoyment. (I must say, that to me, the films assertion that keeping the Iraqi Army and its Chieftains in their positions of power, would be the solution to the problem of democratizing Iraq before we withdrew our troops, seemed rather bizarre. Where that idea came from I cannot imagine.)
At anY rate, if you are able to separate your politics from that of the film's creators, you should enjoy this action-thriller.",1376697600,,1160,4.979381443298969

4022904,1,B002ZG97RY,"British director Paul Greengrass produced this film in 2010 as a political statement very thinly disguised as a thriller. It is a confusing film, rich in conspiracy cliches, and both poorly filmed and acted. It is not surprising that it turned out to be a box office flop. The blatant political statement accuses the United States of falsely claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction as an excuse for the Americans invading Iraq in 2003 and seizing its oil riches. After World War I, modern Iraq was cobbled together from ethnic populations of Kurds, Sunnis, and Shi'ites who hate each other. It can be argued that the Americans made a grave mistake in totally disbanding the Iraqi army because it then required foreign soldiers to control the violence that was released between the three major ethnic groups in Iraq. It was already clear by 2010 that, despite the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the United States had no intention of seizing control of the oil wealth of the can of worms that is modern Iraq and was intent upon getting out of Iraq as quickly as possible. Clear evidence that the Americans did not intend to seize control of Iraq's oil was not going to stop Paul Greengrass making this political statement.",1374278400,4,1269,4.825688073394495

4023034,4,B002ZG97RY,"Good movie.
My own belief is that Bush sent the USA military to Iraq because Saddam H. tried to assassinate Bush's father in Kawate.  The National Government may have thought there were chemical weapons, but so what; most militarized countries have some sort of chemical weapons.  Saddam even used them in the Iraq Iran war and against the Kurds and we did nothing except help Iraq; so why was a war justified this time.
The movie was enjoyable but it hit too hard on the non-existent WMD.  There was even a hit on the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the WMD situation before the war.  Imagine that, news organizations not telling the truth about the government's story line.
Like a lot of moves like this, they are so packed that the second or third viewing is better than the first.  I like to study the way scenes are put together and this movie is worth studying for its good acting and directing.",1362268800,,910,4.524390243902439

4023112,2,B002ZG97RY,"So, in 2010, who among us didn't know that we found no WMD in Iraq? Wasn't it some number close to ZERO? So why make a movie about it, or rather, about the search for WMD?

I so wished the movie had focused more on the bizarre activities described in Rajiv Chandrasekaran's book. Although the film did provide glimpses of it (the pool scene for example), they stood out there with no support, leaving an average viewer to brush it off with little thought. Had more been done in this area I believe at least a morsel of knowledge would have transferred to show how royally screwed up the US Government was then and still is.

Unfortunately we end up with another typical war flick featuring ""the lonely rogue soldier doing the right thing"" character, ""the sole leader who is on his side"" character, ""the evil administration"" guy, on and on. Oh, I forgot---how DID this movie end?? Oh I remember---they didn't find WMD in Iraq.

I can find no criticism of Matt Damon here. He plays these parts as good as anyone, and this is no exception. I can't fault the director Paul Greengrass much either. He did a great job bringing war into our laps (although I will have to add my vote for too much much jiggling of the camera). I thought the backdrop excellent throughout too...colorless, dirty, war-torn towns...this is the Iraq I picture when thinking of that era.

It starts with explosions, noise, and confusion as people scurry to safety. American soldiers are looking for a weapons site. Shots are fired. This site is not secured. There is a sniper on a tower who must be eliminated. Protective gear is used before entering a vault. This site is empty. The information was wrong. At the airport a VIP is returned to his country as the designated new ruler. The higher-ups don't want to hear about a failure. ""How good is the Intel?"" Its not Miller's job to question orders. [Befahl ist befahl.] The CIA man Martin Brown says ""something's wrong"". Another day, another mission. Civilians complain about a lack of water. [No Hurricane Sandy there.] There will be a meeting among the three major groups (Shia, Sunni, Kurds) to meet their new selected leader. There is chaos outside the Green Zone. Brown wants to use the Iraqi army to stabilize the countryside. That's not politically acceptable to Washington.

One Iraqi man complains about his treatment. Freddy has information about a meeting. Can they trust him? They arrive at the meeting place and enter this house. Some men get away. One captive won't talk and is taken away. Where did Freddy go? Freddy wants to help his country. Why is the Intel always wrong? The ""Wall Street Journal"" reporter Lawrie Dayne asks questions. The story is found on the Internet. That prisoner can't tell them what they want to know. [Note the technique used to question Miller abour that notebook.] Will a million dollars pay a captive to not talk? [Internal conflicts?] Miller's transfer is cancelled. That notebook is confiscated. Miller goes to ""Camp Cropper"" to see that prisoner. [You see scenes that are not on Nighttime News.]

Armed men enter a house and begin shooting. Miller talks to reporter Dayne about that Magellan information. She won't give up her sources. It's a man in Washington, a Senior Official. [Can you believe everything in the newspapers?] They look up the info on a computer. They hear of an attack on a ""safe house"". Can Miller send a message to that Iraqi General Al-Rawi? Can he stop an insurgency? The Americans listen to the ""Mission Accomplished"" speech. Miller is tracked by electronic means. Is he ""off the reservation""? All cell phones and electronic media will be monitored. Al-Rawi is to be terminated, and anyone else who is in the way! Miller goes to the bus station. The Allied Forces order the dissolution of all Iraqi organizations. But an American soldier is kidnapped! They will track people by helicopter.

Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller is questioned by General Al-Rawi. Those weapons of mass destruction were dismantled in 1991. The US Government believed the lies to invade Iraq. [Or took advantage of their dismantling.] They want to dismantle Iraq! A man warns ""the Americans are coming"". They arrive, there is more shooting. The Iraqis flee into the streets. Miller follows. An RPG hits the monitoring helicopter! Miller shoots to save Al-Rawi. But a civilian acts! ""Go home, Freddy."" [Freddy is home.] Miller sends an E-mail about manufactured intelligence. The chosen Iraqi leader arrives for a Press conference. Miller talks to that agent. Dayne gets the E-mail, so too many others. What will happen next?.

""They have made a desert and call it peace"" goes an old quote. The War on Iraq marked another departure from past US policy of never declaring war unless attacked. The Gulf of Tonkin was the first manufactured attack, you know how that turned out.",1354752000,,3510,4.932318104906938

4023163,1,B002ZG97RY,"I hated the actors who protrayed the terrorists in ""United 93.""  But, after I viewed it several times, I had to tell myself they were actors and I would never see them again.

Even though I obtained ""The Bourne Supremacy"" from Amazon--because Paul Greengrass directed it and I liked Matt Damon's acting--I wasn't interested in seeing ""The Green Zone.""  I didn't know what it was about, but my review of ""Bloody Sunday"" touched a raw nerve in another reviewer, so I wanted to let sleeping dogs lie by not seeing ""The Green Zone"" at all.

Then, Amazon offered a shooting script of ""United 93"" and I found out the name of the actor, Patrick St. Esprit, who protrayed Major Kevin Nasypany.  I found out on Amazon that he was in ""The Green Zone.""  That's what made me buy it.

Not only was Patrick St. Esprit in ""The Green Zone,"" but other ""United 93"" alums, opening with the head of the ""United 93"" terrorist.  And he had a major role in ""The Green Zone.""  I also saw the actor who menanced the passengers with the ""bomb"" on ""United 93.""  Maybe the other two were there in the grainy dark images.

But Ben Sliney?  I thought he wasn't an actor.  How did he get cast?  That leads me to: why weren't more of the ""United 93"" cast in ""The Green Zone?""  I was disappointed that Patrick St. Esprit didn't have a bigger role.  I thought he would have had a very big role in a war picture.

I could also see the template of ""Bloody Sunday"" in the ""The Green Zone.""  But this time Director Greengrass' film touched a nerve in me watching Americans kill Americans.

4023167,3,B002ZG97RY,"I don't quite know how to sum Green Zone up. It's not a bad movie by any means, but I don't think I could recommend it to everyone either. Green Zone marks the third collaboration of director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon. The two of them are responsible for two of my favorite films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. It's safe to say they know each other well. Greengrass has made his position on the 9/11 conspiracy crystal clear with United 93 and this film. He also did a great job at letting Damon take charge and drive this film home. He gave a strong performance, and that goes without saying Damon stepped right into his standard issue military boots, and everything from then on felt so authentic, that I believed he could really be in the military. He was even surrounded by real-life soldiers, and he fit in to perfection. He plays U.S. Army Sergeant Miller, who after being sent on various dead end missions, decides to go against his orders and discover the truth as to what's really going on with the supposed Weapons of Mass Destruction that the U.S. went to war with Iraq for in the first place. That is already a bit of a touchy subject, and I think that's really where I could not connect with the film. I want to really like it a lot, but I just know that some people are actually going to believe the fictional story. So that's why I think that this movie is trying to make too bold of a statement for what it is, which is false.

Not to sound too negative though, because I did enjoy it. Admittedly, I felt like the film was too political at first. I just couldn't appreciate its strong anti-Iraqi War message. It's obviously propaganda, but my struggle was accepting that this was a fictional point of view. The reason why it was a struggle is because of how uncertain we, as American citizens, are in regards to what all is true, and what's false, in regards to the events of 9/11 and the War on Terror. Don't get me wrong. I'm in no way a supporter of the war or certain decisions that were made by Bush's administration, but I wouldn't be so quick to jump on the bandwagon and make accusations like this film seems to. Considering the simple fact that Green Zone is a fictitious story, I opened my mind and enjoyed it for what it is. It's a bold political thriller that's not afraid to tell a controversial story, and towards the end it becomes basically an action flick with a long stretch of suspense in the dark, and bullets flying left and right. Green Zone is essentially a hybrid of Body of Lies and The Hurt Locker (if the focus was on Spec Ops, rather than EODs). It actually succeeds for the most part, but like many people's complaints about Avatar, the political message is so overwhelming that it's kind of hard to enjoy the film on any other level. I would still recommend giving it a look.

The Blu-ray has a top notch transfer, with reference audio. My biggest complaint are the typical murky dark scenes, which there are a lot of. I love film grain. It gives me a peace of mind that the people who worked on the disc didn't doctor it up to cater to those who have no idea what real film should look like. So needless to say, this movie looked fantastic to me on Blu-ray because it's loaded with grain. Funny thing is, when I first saw it at the theater, it was before I was as into film as I am now, so I too thought it looked pretty bad. Now that I have a better understanding, I get the whole gritty feel Grengrass intended. That doesn't take away from the fact that heavy grain hurts dark scenes. So in this case, the nighttime scenes may look blurry to some, but there should really be no problem making out details. Now on a DVD, that would be another story, but on Blu-ray, I think they look fine. The sound is sure to rock a house or two. Sound effects are perfectly scattered throughout the battlefield when bullets are flying and bombs are going off. There's a helicopter crash in the third act that sums it all up quite well. The extras are nothing to write home about, but we do get a nice commentary that can be listened to like the average track, or watched as a Picture-in-Picture. There are also a couple of sub-10 minute featurettes that briefly adress Damon and Greengrass's connection to the subject matter, as well as a few soldiers talking about the experience being in the film, and acting alongside Matt Damon. I think most people would love Green Zone, but I happen to fall closer to the middle. I definitely recommend the Blu-ray though.

4023239,4,B002ZG97RY,"Most of the negative reviews of this are that it doesn't follow a simplistic patriotic line.  Instead, in my view, it makes an attempt at realism, and it does make a political point:  that we were dupes to local pols and then were too cowardly and dishonest to admit it.  Sure, it is a political opinion, but what if it is true?

Damon gives an excellent performance, though I couldn't judge the realism of the military experience and must trust the other reviewers.  It is suspenseful, scary, and moving.  His personal quest - to figure out where the claims of WMD came from after he can't find them - is completely believable.  Another aspect I liked was how hard it was on the press:  rather than simple heros, they were flawed as well, duped by the administration and ashamed of it.  Damon's American adversaries were believable brutes, if brave in their own ways.  Finally, the Iraki Freddie, a helper who goes his own way in important details, was a very interesting twist.

4023246,3,B002ZG97RY,"It's three years behind being considered ""timely"", yes; certainly, you may have heard this from a plethora of critics.  I resent that.  This event in our country's history is so pivotal, so controversial, that it must be repeated over and over until even the most fickle and inattentive of individuals consider it a tedious act.  It's the only way to deny the next history books any wriggle room for unwarranted subjectivity.

Keeping that in mind, only some will find Greengrass's new thriller intriguing, let alone enthralling.  It may be my, as of yet, lack of mental saturation to the middle eastern debacle which sets me firmly in that alternative minority.

Regardless, it's hardly a love-it-or-hate-it film; this new episode in the Greengrass/Damon saga puts itself at the mercy of audience preconceptions of the second Gulf War, and many of you will ultimately consider it unnecessary.  But, again, I ask:  Is it engrained in you yet?

Well, Greengrass takes steps to achieve just that, taking few risks in a territory treaded by superior predecessors...one of which just recently bringing home a statue.  It's ultimate strengths and flaws are meshed together to make for a fleeting mediocrity that it never quite escapes; after all, despite everything going against it, this is a film with components of undeniably immense talent, and the tried-and-true subject matter is no excuse for its lack of more consistent effort, if not its ability to be extraordinary.

but the real bummer comes from the incompetence and illogical fallacies that accompany ""Green Zone""'s otherwise capable tale of deception.  For every thorn of intrigue, there is an amateurish action to offset its credibility, and it goes a long way to preventing the audience from being engrossed.

That said, it's certainly not without its thrills, and that much is achieved by the steadfast chemistry that Damon and Greengrass seem to share, as well as a strong supporting cast.  Isaacs, the longtime british shoe-in for the gruff, villainous types, is uncannily comfortable playing an American special forces member.  Damon, already proving himself as an easy go-to man for a leading role, is solid but unexceptional - something that I feel may become an unfortunate staplepoint in his immediate career should he not seek out for unconventional roles.  Finally, Gleeson and Kinnear play off of one another perfectly, and I really do wish that more screen time had been given to the two of them.

I feel that I need to reiterate my warning to those who are looking for game-changing insight into what is quickly becoming apart of our history, despite the fact that men and women around the world are being affected by it every day.  Keep in mind that many of the questions Green Zone brings up may have already been answered; or, if they haven't by now, then they're apparently not important enough to the masses to be worth considering.  A cynical view, but one I consider sadly accurate.  But whatever; keep that in mind, and avoid the headlines telling you what's old news, and this very unpunctual thriller may grab you.",1324166400,,3098,5.0019493177387915

Green Zone feels more like a documentary than a fictional movie; it feels more like a movie that wants to deliver truth than melodrama, and that's where it succeeds as a film.

The truth is always too liberal apparently (as are reviews from soldiers actually there). Nobody even now wants to hear about the atrocities on BOTH sides of WW2 (incendiary firebombing civilians in non-military targets in Dresden and Japan... and Vietnam), only how evil the OTHER guys were.
  Like it or not this film is extremely faithful to the truth. No wonder it wasn't popular. The Neocon's (well named actually, world class con artists), saw and believed only what fit their preconceived desire to feed the military industrial complex (re: Halliburton, just coincidentally formerly run by Dick Cheney). Believed is too generous... they cynically thought they could get away with it, and stupidly thought no one would notice or care. Maybe not so stupid either as it turns out. What, we're in a war? Their most brilliant move was to not institute a draft. That much WAS learned from Vietnam... if upper and middle class kids (and their parents and grandparents) have to face the real consequences of following their leaders idiotic (possibly criminal) decisions, there might be an actual (and sustained) protest.
  False ""intelligence"" (an oxymoron ... emphasis on moron), trumped up and never vetted came from a handful of expat Iraqis with their own agenda (in particular a single individual, ""Curveball""), gave our ""leaders"" the plausible excuse ... and the fleets of Young Republican Bushie loyalists from the likes of Oral Roberts University were put in charge of post-invasion policies rather than those with middle eastern expertise, gave us the resulting mess. All were screened on their views of Roe vs Wade... one such a 24 year old ORU grad with zero financial training put in charge of ""rebuilding"" the Iraq stock market. Political partisanship was the primary source for the idiotic decisions that led to fueling anarchy, looting and creating a MASSIVE new insurgency and generations of motivated new terrorists. Ah but we're safer now, right? Billions to contractors that accomplished nothing, except corruption... and electrocuting dozens of American kids in their showers.
  9 years and nearly 5000 lost American youth and a vast unfunded treasure wasted in Iraq (with Afghanistan still going strong), over 100,000 casualties now struggling for the oft promised help at home and getting their GI Bill college grants ripped off by online for-profit fly by night ""colleges"". Oh, also... let's not forget upwards of 500,000 dead local innocents. A body count ratio we'd have been be proud of during Vietnam. Too bad we didn't learn anything from that fiasco.

By all means, rent or buy ""The Patriot"" if you want patriotic pap and our mythological ""Christian"" ethic of treating our neighbors as ourselves.

The plot is merely this:
Following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his men are charged with finding the so-called weapons of mass destruction, whose existence justified American involvement, according to the Pentagon and their man in Baghdad, Poundstone. Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons, it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Also suspicious of Poundstone is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne, who lets slip to Miller that Poundstone told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi, code-named Magellan, who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary. So begins a hunt for the truth.

However, the movie has a disappointing ending and in my opinion, as a true conservative-American citizen and one who believes in the ""fight for freedom,"" this movie left me angry and emotionally fatigued.

Matt Damon carries this movie with an evenly played intensity that never goes over the top. If you're wondering why the military scenes are so well done, you'll learn on the extras that the soldiers playing soldiers in the movie are soldiers. They were also culled from these same army units that were sent out to find these non-existent WMDs.

The director is Paul Greengrass who did the last two Bourne movies with Damon so you get that same level of action but this time it's far better played. Whereas the first Bourne movie (The Bourne Identity) done by Doug Liman stands head and shoulders above the Greengrass follow-ups, Green Zone shows Greengrass knows how to scale it down to a more human level without the action impeding too much on the story.

Kudos to the casting, especially Khalid Abdalla who becomes the translator for Damon's military unit virtually by accident.

By now everyone knows, or should know that the Iraq War was a mistake.  Those who refuse to deny the truth are either woefully misinformed or not living in the same reality as the rest of us (George W. Bush). War is hell, as anyone who has ever been in one can attest; it is a messy business and there is nothing glamorous about it; people die, lot of people die in ways no human should have to expire.  So the decision to go to war has to be made with all due deliberation, it cannot and should not be made on a whim, we as a nation should have no other recourse but war; war should never be a choice, but an absolute imperative.

These are the lessons Green Zone (2010) tried to impart.

The Story

Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93), ""Green Zone"" is set in the opening days of the Iraq War.  Matt Damon (The Bourne Ultimatum) portrays Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller the leader of a company of men looking for DMD.  But at site after site they keep coming up empty, so Miller starts to question the mission and the reasons for the war.

Meanwhile a veteran CIA analyst named Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson ~ Troy) starts questioning the intelligence as well, and locks horns with Pentagon Intelligence Analyst Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear ~ Ghost Town), who has been feeding false information of WMD to the Washington Post through reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan ~ In Treatment).

Their worlds intertwine as the victory is declared by the war goes on.

My Thoughts

I enjoyed Green Zone.  Although this movie is fiction, it is inspired by the work of actual journalist who covered the events surrounding the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the botched intelligence handed down about the weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that were supposed to found there. From start to finish the movie was engaging, fast paced, intelligent, and well-acted.  I have never been one to give into conspiracy theories, but the yarn that unraveled in Green Zone is not so far-fetched.

Matt Damon, as he is won't to do, turned in an excellent performance as the Warrant Officer (based on a real character) bent on finding the meaning in the senselessness that became the Iraq War.  And supporting cast were a fine complement.

""Green Zone"" is a thinking man's movie, and for those who appreciate a rush of adrenaline with their dose of truth. Green Zone is tightly focused never meandering too far from the lack of WMD and how that translates into erroneous and bogus war.  Some may berate the not so subtle political slate that undergirds this movie, but it is one well worth listening to and heeding for the future.",1295740800,2,2735,4.613636363636363

His actions were so over the top, you almost felt like the guy was not in a military branch...he was taking actions like a CIA agent or again his Jason Bourne character.

But as I reflected further on the movie, I came to realize that it actually does a fine job of portraying several important themes, often in a fairly subtle way, in no small part because the movie is well crafted and the acting is solid (Matt Damon has yet to disappoint me).

These themes include disunity among Americans and Iraqis (not just between them), exploitation of the media through misinformation (and the media's susceptibility to such exploitation because of their own agendas), naive and hubristic miscalculations and misjudgments on the part of American leaders and strategists, the suffering of ordinary Iraqi people, pervasiveness of war crimes, the overall ugliness of war and occupation, etc.  Of course, being semi-fictional, the movie is surely not accurate in all of the specifics, but the overall portrayal of what happened is consistent with what's known to the public today.

In the end, I found this movie disturbing, which means that it does its job well.  And, of course, we *should* be disturbed given what happened in Iraq and is still happening there today ...",1291075200,5,1223,5.004926108374384

If you are mostly conservative, you will likely hate this film. If you consider yourself ""middle of the road"", see how you feel about this movie - it may help you decide which side you are really on, if you had to make a choice between calling yourself conservative or progressive.

From what I could tell, the story was indeed based on historical events that somebody lied about the weapons of mass destruction that were supposedly in Iraq before the last major Iraq war, and were used as the main reason why Iraq had to be invaded.  To be fair, it is quite possible that the people doing the lying were not American military or CIA personnel, but were Iraqi informers who had their own reasons for lying (maybe they wanted to remove Hussein from power). One plausible story I read a while back is that the main people lying about the issue were the Iraqi scientists and military people who were afraid to tell their leader (Hussein) the truth that they had actually destroyed all their so-called weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf war in the early 1990s.  Although they knew the weapons no longer existed, they dared not tell the truth to the leader, who would have probably executed them when he found out.

However, let's face it; America would have invaded Iraq whether it had the weapons or not, I think most people can agree it was ""a done deal"".

Oh, that's right, this was a film.  Well, Matt Damon does a fine job as the reluctant soldier looking for weapons; and Greg Kinnear does a good job as the lying American political guy; and that burly Englishman guy who was in 28 Days does a fine job as the suspicious CIA guy.

4023761,4,B002ZG97RY,"The Green Zone with Matt Damon provided me exactly what I was looking for, a good action flick. The political commentary is a bit over the top, but if you're inclined to believe conspiracies about the intelligence and political failures that got the United States into Iraq, it's somewhat believable.

The story is about Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller who is in charge of a U.S. Army team that is supposed to find WMD's in Iraq. However Miller's team not only keeps coming up empty, his team is sent in to places that obviously have not held WMD's for several years, or never had WMD's their in the first place. Miller begins to question the intelligence that he and his team have been given about their targets. Miller befriends a CIA agent Martin Brown, played very well by Brendan Gleeson, who tells him that he's on a wild goose chase. Miller then gets in the middle of a political war between Brown and a character that is obviously supposed to be Paul Bremer, by the name of Clark Poundstone, played well by Greg Kinnear. Brown and Miller set out on a hunt for the individual who is allegedly the source of American intel about WMD, General Mohammad Al-Rawi. If Brown and Miller can locate him, Brown believes Al-Rawi will be able to expose the fact there are no WMD's in Iraq and also be a contact with the Iraqi Army and prevent an insurgency.

Many elements of this movie do ring true and several real life individuals, including Bremer and Ahmed Chalabi are obviously portrayed with fictionalized names in this movie. It's a tribute to writer Brian Helgeland and director Paul Greengrass that they were able to stay somewhat close to what journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran wrote about the Green Zone and the American administration of Iraq in his book Imperial Life in the Emerald City and yet create a great thriller movie.

Unlike other reviewers I didn't have a problem with the hand held cameras, mostly I think because I'm used to them. I found this movie to be far more interesting and watchable than The Hurt Locker. I watched this movie on rental from Amazon. The process to download it to my computer for viewing was quite simple and the quality very good.",1286496000,2,2175,4.658854166666667
4023762,4,B002ZG97RY,"War in Iraq and its moral consequences has generated lots of Hollywood movies in the last few years.  In this one, Matt Damon plays US Army soldier who is tasked to search for weapons of mass destruction with his units of special force soldiers.  As it turns out every mission they are sent out to shows no results.  No weapons are found and all they encounter are groups of angry civilians demanding fresh water, electricity and food.

It a typical thriller plotline we have a mix of politics, espionage, journalism, political indoctrination and patriotism.  One of the most memorable characters is a youn Iranian man, crippled by a war (he lost his leg) who has his own personal reasons to help American forces in their military action in Iraq.  Fluent in English, this young man becomes involved in the mission, more than he bargained for.

A second problem is that I did not feel that the solution to the problem presented by the movie - can Damon show that Iraq does not have ""weapons of mass destruction"" - was resolved dramatically enough.

This movie does an excellent job in portraying what actually happened, when our troops entered Iraq in search of those elusive WMD's (that were never found!) Another point in this movie that is dead on, is how much different agencies in the U.S. do not cooperate with one another. There have been several interviews with people is these agencies that confirmed this claim. They still to this day argue about various intel.

Overall this is a great movie that portrays truth in wartime scenarios. But don't waste your money on the Blu-ray version just yet. The video quality just isn't there to justify the extra expense.",1284681600,,1060,4.786885245901639

4023829,4,B002ZG97RY,"I expected Green Zone to track more closely to the book upon which the movie was based; ""Green Zone, Imperial Life in the Emerald City"", and indictment of the Paul Bremer time in Iraq. Instead the movie's focus was on Matt Damon's character and his team of WMD searchers, which was a minor part of the book. The movie perfectly captured the chaos in Iraq at the opening stages of the war as American troops captured Baghdad, and proceeded to consolidate their presence in Iraq. The handheld camera technique emphasized the way unplanned events unfold and the need to plan on the fly as obstacles present themselves. This movie probably captures the feeling of war as well as any movie. Matt Damon is excellent in his role as a chief warrant officer who takes his job seriously and knows when he is getting a lot of b.s. from his superiors. The cast is uniformly excellent and again the movie captures the tension that existed between the CIA and the Defense Department over the authenticity of the information supplied regarding WMD's in Iraq. The CIA was getting it's information from a former Iraqi general in charge of the WMD program whereas the Defense Department was getting its information from a guy code named ""curveball"" whom even German intelligence said was unreliable. The movie version consolidated the informant into one character, the Iraqi general. There really was a huge disconnect between the civilian political operatives as depicted by the character Poudstone and the military grunts depicted by Damon. Donald Rumsfeld set up is own intelligence operation because he did not trust CIA intelligence or because the CIA was not telling him what he wanted to hear. The movie made it perfectly clear that the CIA and the Defense Department did not get along. I highly recommend this movie since it was not only entertaining but at least 50-75% true account of what happened during that period of time in Iraq.",1284336000,8,1926,4.875
4023830,1,B002ZG97RY,The video quality of the blu-ray is grainy and terrible. Worsen than a bad quality DVD. Really not worth buying this DVD,1284249600,8,120,4.5
4023831,2,B002ZG97RY,"""The Green Zone"" was directed by Paul Greengrass and written by Brian Helgeland based on the book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran. Greengrass also directed the last two films in the Bourne series so here he joins up with Matt Damon again to tell the story of Roy Miller, Chief Warrant Officer for the U.S. army gone rogue to uncover the truth behind faulty intelligence in an unstable region before it turns into a war. It follows specifically the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and casts non-actors but actually experienced ex-Marines and Rangers as army soldiers.

Matt Damon as a soldier is very believable. Let's face it, he's just so darn all-American in appearance and sincerity, I'd take his orders anytime. He leads the cast well and gives the movie merit just by his participation which is top notch as always. But even those blue eyes can't will this movie to explosive heights.

Greg Kinnear plays Clark Poundstone, a high up government guy supplying the information that sends Miller's men out on the charge to find these weapons and every raid turns up empty-handed. Lawrie Dayne played by Amy Ryan is a reporter trying to track down the source of the information who is code-named Magellan.

The story at first seems timely, but it isn't anything new. We've lived this story for years and I think people want to move on. This film was pushed back several times for some reason and as a result, was released in a time where the climate of the masses no longer cares about Iraq having or not having weapons of mass destruction so it has a slightly out-dated feel. Seeing President Bush onscreen giving that victory speech to the soldiers that the war was over feels like old news since it never changed anything. The only real message to take home from this film is how the Iraqi people are not all bad and want this struggle to be over just as much as us Americans back home do, but they want to do it on their terms and not be managed by the USA anymore like children.

There is a constant shaky cam going on during all battle sequences and while it is supposed to be more realistic and frightening, it is more likely to induce a headache or stomachache. The choice must have seemed valid at the time, but running around shaking the camera on purpose just makes it almost unwatchable in parts. What Greengrass did so well in the Bourne movies to create excitement in a one-man versus everyone sense seems really overboard in a war setting.

Bonus Features:

Inside the Green Zone talks about the actual MET (Mobile Exploration Teams) that were charged with finding weapons of mass destruction and the intel packages being received were not matching what was on the ground. The cast raves about Greengrass's ability to create absolute chaos for excitement. The teams' attention to detail in trying to recreate circumstances in Baghdad as close as possible to the real thing is admirable. They come right out and admit that they wanted to make a big-budget popcorn movie for big audiences as well as raising questions and provoking audiences to ask, ""Now what?"" to their government representatives.

Matt Damon: Ready for Action is a featurette about how dedicated Matt Damon was to being a good commanding officer for the actual army guys in the cast taking his orders. He honored accuracy and based his character off a real person whose story this was based on.

There is feature-length commentary with Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass as well as optional commentary for all the deleted scenes. The actor and director have worked together closely on other projects before so there is a camaraderie in how they get along on and off set. Matt Damon jokes that this is one of the first projects with Greengrass where he actually had to look more closely at the script. Great care was taken in accuracy and the big budget action sequences and both feel that this was a timely released film. There are many deleted scenes that give a little more exposition, but are mostly dull overall.",1283817600,2,3988,4.711621233859398

4023834,3,B002ZG97RY,"As a former US Army Infantry Officer, I thought this film would be especially interesting, and it was. However, it confirms my opinion of liberal hollywood people: that they're simply not very smart. That's why they become actors and actresses - because 98% of them weren't smart enough to become doctors or lawyers or businessmen. Most of them never even went to college. Because of this lack of education, most hollywood types lack any real talent for critical thinking.

This whole movie was a propaganda message, trying to convince the viewer that there never were any WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) in Iraq. First of all, too many people don't know what weapons qualify as a ""WMD"". As a US Army NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) school graduate, I can tell you that a WMD is any weapon - nuclear, biological, or chemical - that, if delivered by the proper delivery system, can or will cause massive casualties. So, if our hollywood leftists had any knowledge or critical thinking capabilities, they would not be so cynical of the claims of WMDs made by many governments. Why? Simple...because in the 1980s Iran - Iraq war, Saddam used chemical weapons (WMDs) against the Iranians. After the first Gulf war (Desert Storm), Saddam again used chemical weapons (WMDs) against his OWN people - the Kurds in northern Iraq. There is little dispute about these events, there's too much evidence for even Saddam to deny with a straight face. So, with his history of actually using WMDs, why does Hollywood find it so hard to believe? I think it's because they don't understand that chemical weapons ARE WMDs. I don't say any of this because I want to defend the US Government; I still think most of what we did was wrong, and I friggin' hate G.W. Bush the Idiot...I'm a Libertarian, not a liberal democrat nor a conservative Republican.

As far as the movie itself, the acting was excellent all around. Damon was incredible. Kinnear was surprisingly good, though I hated his character. I just think hollywood would serve us better if they spent more energy trying to create entertainment without injecting their biased and factually incorrect ideology into everything.

4023837,5,B002ZG97RY,"I went into this film with reservations, mostly on account of the average box office pull it made during its run, coupled with the many harsh reviews it received afterward (many of them coming to rest right here on Amazon). But I was set on watching this because it's Paul Greengrass. I've only seen a handful of his films, but if he's nothing else, he's honest about what he's doing. And honesty is all I saw while I was watching this film.

In many ways, GREEN ZONE could be seen as a quasi-bookend to Greengrass' highly-underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/United-93-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000GH3CR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">United 93 (Widescreen Edition)</a>, though we're obviously dealing with a more fictionalized account in this instance. Our invasion of Iraq was, essentially, the epilogue to what happened on 9/11, during a time when we weren't simply focused on the ones who pulled the trigger, but anyone else who might have the distinct possibility. And that's where GREEN ZONE begins, during the opening moments of the invasion. It's shot in such a way that you could almost watch the two films together and not notice the transition. Cause and effect.

For me, UNITED 93 is a very important film. I've watched it several times, and for this movie to begin like it did was emotionally jarring.

But! Then we're off to the races with Matt Damon's character, Roy Miller: to see who can find the most WMDs. And it turns out there aren't any, but it's not like we couldn't see that plot twist coming. The action ramps up very quickly afterward, and pauses only so that you can wrap your mind around what's going on, then you're right back in the middle of it.

The thing is: you can enjoy this movie as a pure thriller. I guarantee that if you go into GREEN ZONE thinking that all you'll be getting is a couple hours of good, intense action, then you've already found it. But the movie's secondary objective is to ask a question that I'm sure many Americans have asked in the years following the invasion.

If the entire reason we went in there became a MacGuffin, then why were we there in the first place? The plot is fictional. The characters are fictional. But by the end of the movie, it ends up trying to hit you closer to home than you might have expected. Because regardless of what you believe, left or right, we paid for something in this war that we never ended up getting. And to that point, I was left just as disoriented as the main character.

But that's beside the point. Did I mention there's some great action? =D",1283299200,3,2592,4.826576576576577

This thriller gave some good insight on the workings of the American government (CIA, Military, Government) but I was really expecting a summer popcorn movie.

Good beginning, only to falter 1/2 hour into it.....

Was hoping for a Jason Bourne Goes-to-War flick, but instead got a Jason Boring.....yawn.

Secondly, Matt Damon's acting is truly riveting. It's the only reason that kept me watching this film till the end.

Thirdly, all other aspects of this picture are disappointing. For example, the hand-held camera style of filming made it very hard to see what's happening.

Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.

Look at the comments and reviews for Hurt Locker here; there are dozens of soldiers pointing out how unreal so much of that film is, and how a real soldier wouldn't do much of what that film shows. Now look at the reviews and comments for Green Zone. I see exactly one soldier who thought it was unrealistic...and then only in how Damon's character steps over the political line of not doing what he's ordered to.

Almost all the soldiers in the film were in Iraq, and they made the decisions on the set about how the battle and other army scenes went. The head consultant, Monty Gonzales, was the guy who did in Iraq what Damon does here: look for WMDs. And for those who call this movie propaganda, he says on the extra doc here that he knew there were no WMDs after his first mission looking for them; Damon takes three missions to decide. So is that real-life soldier a liberal Hollywood propaganda plant? I don't think so.

Looking at this film purely technically, it's got one huge flaw: the hand-held cams are way too shaky. That makes it hard to watch with enjoyment at times. I'm pretty tired of handheld=real; that equation's over and done with by now. Let it go, directors. A spice, yes; a main dish, no. Here it just distracts and detracts.

Damon is pretty good, and the soldiers all said in interviews that they believed him as their chief after two days, so they'd know best. The film feels real, no doubt, and it's a good (not great) thriller, political considerations aside. If you're looking for a war movie, this is a decent one. But avoid the blu-ray; the movie was shot in a very grainy way to make it seem more real, and the dvd gets that across just as well for less coin.

Now let's talk about the story. The truth is, we never did find any WMDs in Iraq, and the intel does look in hindisght to be false. Gonzales, the real soldier in charge of looking for them here, says so himself. Or do you know better than him? He points out that this is a fictional film in an online article he wrote after the film, and obviously that's true. Damon's character could never do what he did here and get away with it. Yet neither would the CIA be as upstanding as they appear here, and willing to fight Bush's White House (Abu Ghraib comes to mind). So it cuts both ways, for those who call this liberal propaganda.

Let's be honest: almost everything around this ""war"" when it was going on was neocon propaganda, and they are the folks who own the defense companies who've made hundreds of billions from all this. Not many liberals are war profiteers, you can at least give them that. So if they want to create their own clearly fictional movie about the war, let them. I'm neither lib nor hawk; I just think we're lied to daily by both sides, dems and reps. I don't trust ANY of 'em.

But I have no issues with watching a movie like this and considering its ideas. If you truly love democracy, you need to hear all three sides of any (war) story: yours, mine, and the truth. From that vantage point, I like this movie more than Hurt Locker. Although it claimed to be apolitical, and ""just showed soldiers doing their jobs"", how can you possibly separate soldiering and morality? That's like saying the German soldiers who rounded up folks with yellow stars and sent them to the showers had no complicity. Come on. At some point we all have to make decisions as to what we're willing to do for our families, our countries, and the human race in general. Isn't that a big part of what America, and the whole old Hollywood John Wayne/Clint Eastwood mythos, is all about?

That's what makes Green Zone interesting; it goes where Hurt Locker was afraid to go. It lets soldiers make moral decisions. Realistic or not, it's a very thought-provoking idea, and since when is thinking deeply about a war that cost us a trillion dollars, and so much more vitally cost hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis their lives, since when is it wrong to really consider how honest and right the entire war was? Never, I'd say. I want all sides of the picture. Which is why we hear so little about Afghanistan: the money is rolling in for the contractors, and the less we think about that, and what we're really achieving over there, the better for the war profiteers. War is great business, and once you get one going, it's a gravy train (if not for liberals, those poor suckers).

Let's be honest: if we really love our soldiers, why do we want to put them in harm's way? Why do we treat them like trash once they've lost limbs for us and come home to be homeless in many cases? Do we really care about them as people, or do we just want them to die for us so we can wave the flag and feel noble and proud? These are questions that rarely get asked, and any movie that addresses them is worth watching.

As the vet from Iraq who lives next to me says: if we truly love American soldiers, why are we sending them off to die in order to to rebuild other countries, when we're not rebuilding our own? One line here resonates over and over as we watch our country go bankrupt behind this war, for no apparent reason but greed: ""Don't be naive.""

The Green Zone asks those tough questions, and for that it's worth watching.",1282780800,101,5227,4.395036194415718
4023901,4,B002ZG97RY,"There are not many films that make sense about Iraq.  Most just want to relate what the grunts are doing in a hopless mess there.  This movie tries to provide some explanations.  While I don't buy into all the conspiracry stuff that action films like this often portray, there is little doubt that the Bush Admin. sold America a bill of goods on Iraq.  We invaded the country for no reason. We continue to pay the price for our folly today.  Intelligence was exaggerated and falsified.  WMDs did not exsit, even though Saddam acted as though they did.  The media fell in line with our corporate oligarchy and did not question the validity of our actions.

This film shows the chaotic mess that our invasion produced there, and conveys the confusion of a mission gone wrong.  The cover up for WMDs that just weren't there seems a likely scenario. Normally I am not into pretty boy actors like Matt Damon, but he does a decent job portraying a special unit commander who is perplexed by the situation.  The film shows how we likely dropped the ball in not letting the Iraqi army cooperate with our occupation of the country.  We niavely thought US Capitalism would re-make Iraq and the Middle East. This film shows that well, and the stone-headed administrators like Paul Bremmer III, our Roman Procounseler who tried to run the country like a US corporation, and failed.

Probably one of the best films to come out of the Iraq mess so far, even though I agree that its hard to follow at times and requires several viewings to get all the details down straight. I wish the film's extras had more on what inspired the original story, as opposed to Matt just bonding with the cast!  I regret all the sacrefices our forces have made there, as one US soldier's life is not worth all of Iraq!

The Green Zone is the story of Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon), a man whose team is responsible for finding WMDs in Iraq.  Much like Ben Affleck's trophy shelf for acting, Miller's team continues to come up empty.  One must question the intelligence that leads to so many duds, but enough about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paycheck/dp/B001U0HAZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paycheck</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jersey-Girl/dp/B00029LO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jersey Girl</a>.  Only after he begins the hunt for the ""Jack of Clubs"" - which, incidentally, was the original target from a mission past that ended up at the Baghdad Jack in the Box - does Miller get frustrated and decide to go rogue, leaning on a one-legged Iraqi local to untie a complicated knot similar to the one I had in my stomach after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bounce/dp/B000059MQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bounce</a>.  From that point it's a perilous thriller/action film, with chase scenes galore, bullets aplenty, a great soundtrack, very crisp editing, professional acting (no one really stood out), and enough political conspiracy theories - tied mostly to scheming Pentagon politico Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) - that I broke out the tinfoil.  (Honestly, would it kill Hollywood to step away from the second helping of Thanksgiving propaganda?)

Just go into it with intentions of ignoring the political bias, enjoying most of the action.  And the freedom with which Miller's team gallivants about Iraq?  Completely unbelievable, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>

The filming was on shaky-cam overload; call it the migraine-cam.  It's ""watching Cloverfield on a laptop while riding a rollercoaster during an earthquake""-shaky.  There are chases and gunplay scenes that are almost indiscernible.  The overload of one second burst-movements almost made me have a different kind of movement, one that stinks, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gigli/dp/B0000DKDUT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gigli</a>.

Overall, Green Zone is some fact more fiction, mostly shock sometimes awe, and far too insistent on pushing a tired political message and creating conspiratorial connections between Damon and Kinnear when it would have benefitted more if the two actors were physically connected like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stuck-On-You/dp/B00005JMG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stuck On You</a>.",1282003200,,2984,7.027027027027027

4024008,2,B002ZG97RY,"Green Zone is an arrogant, self-indulgent political thriller that doesn't thrill, since you already know the story before it even takes place. Green Zone doesn't add anything new to the debate and doesn't really care to. Call it wish-fulfillment, or call it a misguided attempt at a compelling political thriller sprinkled with action, but Green Zone doesn't succeed in much of anything.

First off, I actually agree with what the film is trying to say. My disagreement is not on a political level. Quite the opposite, the film actually makes some good points on why the WMD mishap happened. Granted, you have to work in the subtext, but when Matt Damon is shut down by his Superior's because of his rank, and because of the lack of questioning and oversight in the military, that's one of the real-world reasons. Greengrass also adds a lot of great detail to the film about the experience of the early days of the war in general, such as the mood of the citizens, the various looting, etc. It's the Clark Poundstone I didn't really care for in the least bit. Granted, you have to condense real people into a central person, but Poundstone is simply a one-note character there to be evil. But Matt Damon doesn't really have a personality either, as he is simply a vehicle for the events around him, and very little beyond that. Thus, since the writing is mostly terrible and everything else is middling, it's Greengrass' direction that makes it at least somewhat interesting. I like the way he uses the shaky-cam, I like the way he presents the movie, with the exception of dialogue scenes.

But getting back to the Iraq War aspect of it, it all feels like water under the bridge since there is very little perspective to the movie. It took a good ten years for good Vietnam War movies to start coming out, and it took that long because the films had perspective. Greengrass thought of the idea in 2004 for the film barely a year after it happened. There's no way you can have prospective on it. There's no way you can look at the events without emotion or bias. The thing about the Bourne movies is that even though they were dealing with current issues, the fiction of it felt distant enough to give it a little prospective.

Thus, Green Zone feels kind of like Bourne placed into the real world, and the resulting mash-up is sort of a trainwreck. Bourne dialogue now sounds stupid/poorly written. Bourne characters now feel needlessly one-note. Even the roguish Matt Damon character doesn't translate well into the real world.

4024053,3,B002ZG97RY,"This movie takes place in the general time frame of April-May, 2003.  This is the period just after the initial invasion as US officials began to start the work of stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq.  Several key participants in that phase of the Iraq War are easily recognized.  Paul Bremer head of the Coalition Provisional Authority is represented by the character Clark Poundstone, Judith Miller of the New York Times is represented by the character Lawrie Dayne and Ahmed Chalabi appears in the film in the form of Zubaidi.  Viewers interested in how closely this film mirrors actual history should do some background reading on these individuals.

Near the top of the end credits we learn that the film was inspired by the book, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Imperial-Life-in-the-Emerald-City/dp/0307278832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Imperial Life in the Emerald City</a>"" by Rajiv Chandrasekaran (Washington Post).  This award winning book is a fascinating read and unlike most books of the period doesn't overreach with hype and a crusade for someone to demonize.  Chandrasekaran's observant eye paints a realistic picture of the scene and the CPA's mostly flawed activities.  And let's be clear, there is nothing partisan about finding fault with the CPA's execution of its mission because even the most loyal of Bush supporters have criticised the CPA.  Newt Gingrich is quoted as saying, ""Bremer is the largest single disaster in American foreign policy in modern times.""  Anyone interested in the period should read the book and other historical accounts.

The film does a decent job of reflecting the flavor of ""Emerald City"" with the absurdities and screw ups.  Dominos pizza is served by the pool in the heart of Baghdad.  American leadership hand picks a new Iraqi leader that has not lived in Iraq for decades and is predictably discredited by other Iraqi leaders.  The army is prematurely disbanded along with many other major social institutions that might have helped organize the rebuilding.

The action is OK although I think the chase toward the end is bizarre.  The resolution of the chase was interesting though with what Freddy does and says.  It caps one of the main messages of the film.

The bits of preachiness and wacky plot contrivances are disappointments and I think they do an injustice to the book.  But the film still delivers on some action and the big picture of what happened during the time.  This is OK as an action/political thriller but this film is not a great one.  Although based on real people and events, it is still fiction so one has to be careful about what details to absorb from it.

I'm glad I watched the film but I'm also glad I didn't buy it.  Being based on a great book boosts this up to 3 stars from me.  I hope it stirs debate and encourages Americans to read the book.",1280620800,,2869,5.05531914893617

4024056,2,B002ZG97RY,"I had a sneaking suspcicion after watching Green Zone that the reviews on Amazon.com devoted to this movie would be decidedly split since it does toss around a still volitale political football.  In this case, the lightning rod issue is the Iraq War and the infamous search for WMD's (Weapons of Mass Destruction).  Not surprisingly, the film has drawn praise and scorn for its take on the controversial issue.  Ultimately, this is the movie's downfall.  It is more concerned with pushing a political agenda than it is with delivering an enthralling, complex and well developed story.

Matt Damon stars as Roy Miller, the chief of a U.S. military unit searching for WMD's at various sites in Iraq in 2003.  Miller quickly begins to question the intel he is relying on when site after site continues to come up empty.  Soon, he finds himself trying to get to the bottom of a coverup by the U.S. government involving a source known as ""Magellan"", who has been providing the faulty intel.  That's really about all there is to the plot of the movie.  Director Paul Greengrass attempts to build a tense action thriller around this thin plot, but it falls flat.  Depending on one's political leanings, I suppose the movie could be viewed as a bold and truthful indictment of the Bush administration, or a total crock of liberal garbage.  Personally, I don't think either interpretation is completely correct.  I am by no means knowledgable on all of the facts surrounding the war in Iraq (accuse me of ignorance or apathy if you will), but my guess is that the truth is far mmore complicated than either side, and especially this movie, wants to admit.

A fast paced action film that entertains and highlights underlying ethical issues.  It shows enough of the human side of various characters and their sides to allow you to empathize with all the positions.  The film does an excellent job of slowly unveiling the complexity of the issues.  It makes it clear there are no easy answer.

Apart from the Rambo Style action and the hero who never runs out of wit and ammo, and ends up killing everyone on his own in every language possible.(Keeping the Hero Soldier theme alive) Mat Damon was a good choice for the film. The other nice thing about this film is that for the first time it is finally given out as a fact that the Iraqis had prepared for a Guerilla War in case the defence of the cities was not possible.

Plenty of action and excellent support cast make it a great ride (almost to much with the bouncy camera). The truth about the cover up of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) will be viewed with bias just as it was before. Those that believed in the administration right or wrong will call it lies, and those that have open minds or were against the Bush administration will call it an expose. Whichever camp you are in there is no denying it was well written, casted, directed, and executed. When I first heard no WMDs were found during the initial searches in Iraq it did not surprise me. It wasn't so obvious to some as to the propaganda perpetrated by the administration to gain support for the lifes and money that would be lost and that are still being lost for the Iraqi war. Calling it Operation Shield and Freedom doesn't change the fact it was no more than a means to remove an evil man from power only to try to impose our own governments desires. Based on this one has to ask why was Bush re-elected? Although I appreciate this story coming to light I would have to say I wish it had come sooner. Nonetheless it is well worth seeing this movie to get a better picture of all our in-fighting, mistrust, and ignorance on both sides. Even those that hated the Republican Guard did not do themselves any favors by the support for the immediate dismantle of the Iraqi military. If it had been then why almost eleven years later do we still have military in Iraq? Years later they finally tried to reinstate the military and police so that we can withdraw. What does that tell you? The military advisors for the movie did a great job in portraying how our soldiers give service to their country.

So since none of us are David Denby or Anthony Lane,  here goes a super brief review:

Matt Damon delivers a purposeful, severe and gritty performance.  He doesn't smile once in any scene.

The action sequences are also predictably grim.

Greg Kinnear gives his first bad-guy performance, and he is quite believable.

And then there's Igal Naor, who did such an amazing job of playing Saddam Hussein on the HBO miniseries, shines as General Al Rawi, the man who was ""misquoted"" about WMD's at a Jordan meeting just prior to Shock and Awe.

The direction by Paul Greengrass is slick and chase oriented, as he did so well in the 'Bourne Ultimatum.'

4024250,1,B002ZG97RY,"Hollywood and Politics seem to have an inexplicable love affair that can on occasion deliver a great film with a message or can merely deliver a message with a shoddy film. Unfortunately, this film is the latter.

As the title suggests, the film takes place shortly after the American invasion of Iraq. Saddam's retinue is scattering and take refuge within Baghdad. Matt Damon leaves an army team in search of potential sites hiding weapons of mass destruction. His character rapidly descends into trite dialogue bordering on being sanctimonious. The inteligence briefing scene containg Damon's rogue assertions the inteligence is flawed is as contrived as the weak dialogue that continues throughout the movie.

My complaint has nothing to do with the message and everything to do with the delivery. The frenetic search for non-existent WMDS through the sidealleys of Baghdad lacks realism and seems exclusively bent on Matt Damon's search to prove there are none. Forget character development or even inter-character relationships to build some story of the actual setting. The hilarious fight between special forces and matt damon's army team requires a complete suspension of reality to avoid laughing.

This will end up on TBS on Saturday mornings sandwiched between Segal B films and infomercials. Not worth the time.",1279670400,7,1323,5.320574162679426
4024251,4,B002ZG97RY,"It seems that people in general are growing weary of any contemporary war stories.  Green Zone was marketed as another slick action thriller, but it still sort of flopped at the box office.  I was prepared for another simple, high octane popcorn flick with plenty of explosives and bullets whizzing by.  But there is a much greater purpose here than to merely entertain.  Director Paul Greengrass is sending out a startling message that hits with ferocious power.  Packed with tremendous performances, this gets my vote for the surprise action movie of the year.

Matt Damon stars as Roy Miller, a Chief Warrant Officer on the hunt for Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.  His frustration continues to mount as each search comes up empty.  At a debriefing, he questions the intel that keeps sending his crew on these wild goose chases.  His leaders seem pretty disinterested.

Here's where the story gets complex, plus totally fascinating.  Loyalties and trust start to dissolve as Miller realizes he needs to take a different approach in order to make any progress.  He secretly works with a CIA agent and a Iraqi local in order to track down Al Rawi, one of Saddam's evil henchmen.

The story advances in a gripping, believable fashion.  I especially loved the general points this movie made about the media coverage.  It is revealed that some well-respected news sources might have the facts equivalent of the tabloids.  But still the public gobbles up whatever they are serving, without any second thoughts.  The truth is often distorted and subjective.

Green Zone has some intense action, and utilizes the hand held camera movement in order to capture the chaos and confusion of the war.  Although dizzying and ultra violent in some parts, really the pacing here is pretty controlled as it builds the story.  It makes some profound points that are hard to disregard.  Some thought provoking questions about the war.  Questions about out leaders, reasons, strategies, and consequences.  Melding fact and fiction, Greengrass studied intensively about the entire situation in the Middle East.  This movie is his springboard for voicing his conclusions.  He isn't preaching, he's providing answers and opinions.

Michael Moore called this ""the most honest film about the Iraqi War made by Hollywood.""  Overall, I enjoyed this film more than last year's Oscar winner The Hurt Locker.",1279584000,66,2385,5.079896907216495

4024253,4,B002ZG97RY,"I really enjoyed the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon directed by Paul Greengrass.  I had read a lot of mixed reviews about how GREEN ZONE was not true to military standards & the filming was too much hand held filming giving you a bit of motion sickness.  On the strength of the Bourne movies I bought the Blu Ray.  I found the movie to be good in terms of Blu Ray quality but not excellent due to the hand held filming method & low light filming.
  I found the movie itself to be very enjoyable and quite believable in regards to the storyline & political games Washington plays.  Did Washington fabricate the WMD story?  Maybe they did, maybe they did not........ but this slant is one possible truth that we probably will never learn.  I did not see any anti-American or Anti-Military flavor to the movie.  They just raise the possibility that some high placed people wanted the U.S. to invade Iraq with or without WMDs.  It reflects the fact that military men & politicians blindly follow orders  from higher up and do as they are told.  Some men however question the orders they receive and look for the real underlying truth .

  This movie is fiction based loosely on real events.  I was not looking for a true to life documentary ........but just good escape entertainment.

4024256,4,B002ZG97RY,"As an action flick and thriller, it succeeds very well and right from the moment you press ""play"".  Message-wise it is also interesting.  Here we have a CIA guy who's been in the country 20 years and feels it would be in the country's best interest to instill what was left of the Iraqi militia in the new govt.  There is logic in his reasoning as we witness a chaotic and war-torn Iraq in constant background.  Then we have a solder (Damon) running around from site to site on a mission to find WMD and not finding any.  A tip from a local guy who later becomes his personal translator leads him to the whereabouts of the head of the Iraqi army.  When the soldier (Damon) comes up with a little black book listing the whereabouts of that former Iraqi general, he is faced with a decision about whom to give it to - the CIA guy or his own chain of command.  As he seems to be getting the run around from his own command on these bogus WMD sites, he decides to hand it over to the CIA guy.  Working with him Damon goes about looking to find and bring back the general.  We feel Damon's frustration with not being able to find WMD and also his suspicion in whether or not there ever were any.  Background being what it is we can also sympathize with his siding with the CIA guy.  What gives this movie it's counterperspective though is Damon's Iraqi translator.  HE doesn't want to see this general put into the new govt.  When that stance is revealed, we suddenly question Damon's original and seemingly sensable quest - the Iraqi translator hates the general.

It's an interesting movie that makes you wonder about truth and fiction regarding the war.  Not that the movie is the first thing that ever made anybody wonder about that.  It's going to get under some people's skin because it takes true subject matter and mixes it with a fictious story - but again it'll have you wondering just how much of it is fiction.  For example, I'd like to know if there was any truth in the so-called ""Jordan talks"" where according to the movie, the general told them there were no WMD but then it was reported back to Washington that according to same general - there were.  In the beginning of the movie the soldiers are being led on their wild goose chase for WMD by instructions supposedly having been left by the general.  Later we find out from the general himself that those things were never said.  This being one of the special reasons Damon's chain of command wants him dead.  Again, there are a lot of tidbits like this that help form the basis of the movie and whether or not these events have been culled from fact or fancy, you don't know.  You know some of it's true, because they certainly didn't find WMD with that as justification for invasion basically and you know that troops are still there now.  So, how much of this movie is fact and fiction will play with your mind a little. If it is a propaganda film, then it is a clever propaganda film.

First of all, it was so boring and slow that we had to watch it in 3 different 'sittings' because we fell asleep the first 2 times.....  and we both said to each other as we struggled to sit through the last 40 minutes of it: "" Gee, I have not wanted to turn off a movie and never watch the rest of it , in a long long time! "".  Yes, it is that boring!  Now, let me get on to the second complaint - This is pure propaganda to make one feel sorry for the Iraqi people, the poor old Iraqi bald general and his officers!  It also is intended to make you HATE the special forces, and most of the other American soldiers and officers... basically , anyone except glorious Matt Damon and his few special follower soldiers.  In this movie, Damon runs around apparently with no chain of command ( he doesn't answer to any higher ups for most of the movie ), he even STRIKES one of the special forces guys in the face and there is NOTHING done about it.  PLEEEEASE!!!!!!!  The movie shows the 'poor helpless"" iraqi people that just want water!  that is all they want!  and the mean old AMERICANS DRIVE RIGHT PAST!  This movie is so blatantly anti America that I can hardly type right now I am so angry!  SPOILER ALERT:  DAMON even causes the DEATH of the main special forces guy by distracting him at the film's end and a iraqi shoots the SF guy dead.

  Avoid this movie at all costs.  I am glad i didn't pay ONE PENNY to see it , as my wife paid to rent it.  I would have demanded my money back.  I wish I had never seen it.

4024352,3,B002ZG97RY,"The best scene in ""Green Zone"" is the first one: As the United States' ""Shock and Awe"" campaign grips Baghdad in 2003, an Iraqi general named Al Rawi, standing in the equivalent of a throne room, scribbles a final furious note before he's whisked away to safety. In the midst of this bombing, a plot seems to be forming. What is it? The general's party drives into the night, and director Paul Greengrass pulls back his camera to reveal the city under siege, as thin, orange spears of fire with gray mushroom tops dot the landscape, a few luxury trucks and cars skittering to some underground location.

It's a moment worthy of ""Apocalypse Now,"" crossed with the political intrigue Greengrass captures with a journalist's detail. Amidst chaos - a story is afoot.

But what follows is an action movie in grad school loafers, packed to the gills with ""authentic,"" technocratic details rushing across the lens of Greengrass' camera. ""Green Zone"" has a point in mind - that the U.S. government made up evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to invade the country and impose an America-friendly democracy in the Middle East - and the perfect liberal, All-American actor to carry out the mission in Matt Damon. In other words, it is a eight-minute read in the Sunday New York Times stretched out to two hours and populated with guns, helicopters, chases and Damon playing a Commando Will Hunting, a know-it-all gleam in his eyes.

Which isn't a problem if Greengrass had chosen to create a visual commentary that mirrored the movie's opening scene and stood apart from Brian Helgeland's screenplay, rather than running two inches off Damon's tail for the entire film. Or perhaps it's Helgeland heeling at the feet of Greengrass, who got to shoot this vanity project in exchange for considering to direct the fourth ""Bourne"" picture. Either way, it's another news story playing Iraqi War games, with a fantasy epilogue that frankly undercuts the enormity of America's con - if so you're inclined to believe there was one. ""Green Zone"" has not a moment of irony or levity - just cool, camo-colored outrage.

Damon is Roy Miller, a Chief Warrant Officer looking for WMD. We see a search raid complicated by looting; the unit finds nothing but pigeon poop. The intelligence is wrong, Miller announces during a briefing for a visiting general, who doesn't know or particularly care. But CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson, miscast) pulls Miller aside and hands him his card. Later, he'll recruit Miller for a mission to capture Al Rawi (Igor Naor) - one of Saddam Hussein's most brutal generals. But not to torture him.

Miller traces the WMD puzzle to a conflicted Wall Street Journal reporter (Amy Ryan) and finally some Bush administration lackey named Clark Poundstone, played by Greg Kinnear as one of those annoyed think-tank nerds who operates in a vacuum of buzz words and political ideals despite the war unfolding in front of him. Like most movies set during the second Iraq War, ""Green Zone"" supplies Miller with an Arabic sidekick, this one named Freddy (Khalid Abdulla), who serves as the ""conscience of Iraq,"" interjecting mirthless platitudes about Iraqi self-determination. He's an essentially a gun that been introduced onstage; eventually, you know he'll go off.

""Green Zone"" is complex, but not mysterious; we know where Miller is headed, and so do the characters in the movie, creating a kind of split-second photo finish. At times Greengrass presents military tracking technology as omniscient beyond reason; urban warfare is not really the video game the climax suggests. Damon proved during the ""Bourne"" trilogy that he's up for the physical challenge, but his Miller is irascible and smug in emotionally. His final salvo, via email, is followed by a shot of him looking resolute while riding off in the desert; it's patently ridiculous, given what's in that email - and what faces him when he returns from patrol.

On-location shoots in Spain, Morocco and England drove the film's budget to $100 million; Greengrass will be lucky to recoup half of that despite peddling ads during the Super Bowl. The movie was box-office poison, to the chagrin of some critics, and the delight of political conservatives. Commercial and critical considerations should rarely merge; indeed, they're often locked in a zero-sum game. But ""Green Zone"" belongs to a growing subset of war films rejected almost in reflex by moviegoers, who are unwilling to fork over a ten spot for a current affairs lesson. Funny, fickle folks that they are - they happen to be right about ""Green Zone, which claims thriller status but, stripped down, is nothing more than a scolding.

Does this film have a `political' message. No. If by political one means the whole left-right `thing.' But it does have a message; or, more correctly--`messages.'

1) War should be, truly, a `last' resort.
2) Don't consider war without triple checking sources and making certain that sources are independent of each other.
3) Don't depend on people who have reasons of political or financial gain as a primary, and certainly not an `only' source.
4) Torture is not the way to obtain reliable information; also, it's barbaric; also, it (in the case of Iraq) damaged America's international reputation.
5) Make certain that `you' have the resources in place to maintain peace after the battle has `ended.'

However, after reading the negative reviews, I realized how truly thought provoking this movie really is. The movie is based upon truth, not fiction. We can simply examine what was happening in Iraq at the time, and the controversy over both the WMD issue and the shape of postwar Iraq to realize that we really only need to change some of the names in the movie to make it almost completely factual.

Matt Damon does a great job in portraying the frustrations surrounding the civilian/military partnership in postwar Iraq, and what actually occurred. The disinformation campaign both prior to the war, and even today, specifically about the WMD in Iraq is mind-boggling. It's why so many Americans have so little trust in their own government.

Even today, some people still believe that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 and that the Iraqi WMD was somehow transferred to Syria. Incredible. Try the Freedom Fries and some Kool-aid.

In short, this movie is thought provoking. It's not an action film, in my opinion, but an interesting political thriller in the same vein as Edge of Darkness.

People who reviewed this negatively for political reasons need to do a little more research. If you question the premise for the Iraq War, it doesn't mean you're not patriotic. Quite the contrary.",1278288000,9,1427,4.884297520661157
4024429,4,B002ZG97RY,"""The Green Zone""  takes place shortly after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the priority for the American military was locating weapons of mass destruction.  Chief Warrant Officer Miller (Matt Damon) has just secured the third location supposed to contain these weapons and come up empty yet again.  He is convinced the intelligence he's receiving is faulty, and his investigation leads him on an unauthorized attempt to assemble pieces of a puzzle that, by themselves, don't make sense.

Director Paul Greengrass, who directed the second and third Bourne films with Damon, incorporates the quick editing, chases, and nonstop energy that characterized these movies, but never gives viewers adequate time to digest the ramifications of what Miller is encountering.  Of course, we have the benefit of hindsight, while Miller is first wandering through a maze of inconsistencies, politics, clandestine agendas, and red herrings.

Damon's Miller is appropriately courageous, high-minded, patriotic, and intelligent, so we're in his corner.  The script by Brian Helgeland, however, is like a burst piata, with a shower of subplots, characters, and themes.  The movie eventually settles into a competent action picture rather than a methodical look at the waste the war has caused in lives, money, and political capital.  It also touches on journalistic complacency, one of the reasons many Americans initially accepted going to war with Iraq.

""The Green Zone"" attempts to tackle the bad politics that got us into war but defeats its own purpose by putting too many ingredients in the blender.  There's enough here for a couple of movies, and the issues are merely skimmed so that action can dominate the screen.

The two-disc Blu-ray edition contains a Digital Copy of the film and several bonus extras, including deleted scenes, the featurette ""Inside the Green Zone,"" a Matt Damon profile, and feature commentary with director Greengrass and Matt Damon.

What I don't like is being insulted and clubbed by the Hollywood propaganda machine. Yes, we were told there were WMDs somewhere in Iraq... Yes, none of significance were found... No it doesn't mean they were never there, weren't moved, etc. Got it? Can we move on?

This movie would have been much stronger and more complex if it had muddied the propaganda message by showing the history and intelligence behind the belief of all the Western allies (and including the previous Clinton administration) that Sadam had WMDs, and showed his refusal to allow inspections that would prove his denial. But this movie didn't bother with that part of the truth because it was, as indicated elsewhere, not looking for anything as complicated or nuanced as reality.

Green Zone is merely the latest exercise in Hollywood vanity.

4024435,5,B002ZG97RY,"One of the most common complaints I've read about this film is the ""liberal agenda"" that this film represents. I didn't know that the search for truth is exclusively a ""liberal agenda"" and the ""Hollywood Elite"" is only interested in slamming the Bush Administration and not exploring other ideas and creating solid art. Why is that such a knee-jerk reaction over films of this element? If this were an ""anti-Obama"" or ""anti-Clinton"" film, would these same people be making these claims? Of course not. I believe that time will out and this film may very well be regarded as a great film, as it should already be.

When I first heard of Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass reteaming for a film about the current Iraq war, I was very excited since I am a HUGE fan of their previous work together. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY/ULTIMATUM are two extraordinary pieces of action filmmaking and represent the best that the techno spy thriller genre has to offer. Later hearing that it was based on a true story about the search for WMD at the beginning of the Iraq war, I was even more interested to see how Greengrass would handle such a subject. After all, Greengrass, as a filmmaker, is no stranger to the territory of this subject matter, namely the great and tragic docudrama UNITED 93.

So while we follow Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller's (Damon, excellent as per usual) quest to find WMD and find why he keeps coming up snake-eyes for all of his and his team's efforts, and why he keeps finding himself out of the loop between the Army, the Department of Defense, and the CIA keeping him in the dark while people are dying. The film turns from Iraq War film to mystery/thriller as Miller finds himself searching for a top-secret contact code-named Magellan, who is the person providing the misleading intel about the WMD. He finds himself either paired up or at odds with a Wall Street Journal reporter (the wonderful Amy Ryan, who admittedly doesn't have a lot to do in this film) who has been reporting on the confirmation of the WMD in Iraq, the top CIA man in Iraq (a terrific Brendan Gleeson), and the two-faced face of the DOD for the Administration in Iraq (played with force and conviction by Greg Kinnear). As the hunt for Magellan becomes more intense, so does the effort to stop Miller before he gets too close to the truth (represented by an unrecognizable Jason Isaacs as a mega-tough Special Forces operative).

Before you start to think that because Greengrass and Damon have reunited for a film that this is ""Jason Bourne in Iraq"", you'd be dead wrong. Roy Miller couldn't be more different than Jason Bourne. They are both men of action who are on a quest for facts and that's where the similarities end. Damon is a great actor, and he turns in another great performance here. Greengrass is a tremendously gifted director with a real eye for pacing and putting the audience in the thick of the events and action in his films. Speaking of which, can we stop whining about his ""shaky-cam"" action style? It works. It's intense. It won't make you throw up. End of story. The script by the great Brian Helgeland, who has scripted so many terrific films like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CONSPIRACY THEORY (severely underrated), MAN ON FIRE, MYSTIC RIVER (and also happens to be a very good director in his own right with A KNIGHT'S TALE, THE ORDER and PAYBACK), also turns in a tight and real script here.

There isn't really a false move in this whole film, and it explores a fundamental flaw to something that shouldn't be ignored.

The interesting part of this film is that it is based somewhat in fact. The character of Roy Miller is based on a real Warrant Officer who was asking many of the same questions that Miller asks. Obviously there's some dramatic license taken here, but still... why we go to war is as important as the lives that are lost during that war.

In regards to the Blu-Ray disc, the supplemental material is pretty great and the transfer looks and sounds terrific, so I'm not sure why there have been complaints to the transfer.

All in all, Greengrass and Damon bring us another intensely satisfying film experience, and whatever your beliefs about the Iraq war, this is a film worth viewing.",1278028800,8,4210,4.65814266487214

4024437,3,B002ZG97RY,"The main message of this movie is that the U.S. had no credible basis for fighting in Iraq, especially its supposed reason of finding WMDs.  This gripping, action film was directed by Paul Greengrass (the same director of the Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum).  Matt Damon plays Chief Roy Miller, the Army warrant officer who leads soldiers in Iraq to find the WMDs, only to find that there are no WMDs.  Where are all the WMDS?  How reliable are the intel?  How come no one is asking the hard questions?  Meanwhile, Miller strives to find out the truth and seeks to find General Al-Rawi, the Baathist general working under Saddam -- he's the man who knows where the WMDs are.  The U.S. forces, influenced by U.S. policymaker Clark Poundstone, want to find Al-Rawi for a different reason, to assassinate him in order to cover up the truth about the WMDs.

Brian Helgeland wrote the script and this movie is based upon the 2006 non-fiction book Imperial Life in the Emerald City by journalist Rajiv Chandrasekran.

There are 4 main messages presented in this film:

1) The higher ups in determining the policy in Iraq distorted the evidence and lied to the American public.  The main bad guy (Clark Poundstone) is played by Greg Kinnear, who represents the U.S. policymakers in the Bush Administration.

2) The real reason why the U.S. went to war in Iraq is to get rid of Saddam Hussein

3) The U.S. made the fatal blunder of dismantling the Baathist party and the Iraq Army rather than working with them to build a New Iraq

4) We aren't in a position to determine what happens in Iraq

In relation to the first point, if there were no WMDs in Iraq and it was all a fabrication by the Bush Administration, why was it that President Clinton was also convinced that there were WMDs in Iraq?  Was he going by the same faulty intel?

To its credit, this film is a gripping war-drama, shot in Paul Greengrass fashion by a lot of hand-held cameras and done in ""you are there"" documentary style.  I felt that the message was pretty heavy-handed.

There are no special features in the DVD. I wished that there would be some special features that provide a featurette on the making of the movie and why the movie was made.  There was none of that in this DVD.  This is one of the reasons why I deleted a star.

If you're in the mood for a highly political war drama, then this movie is for you.  I felt that the movie ""The Hurt Locker"" was more effective than this one:  the Hurt Locker tried to describe what was happening in Iraq without a heavy-handed message;  as such, it allowed the viewers to make their own conclusions about the war in Iraq.

If you're looking to buy this movie, I cannot recommend the blu-ray version.  The picture quality is a mixture of acceptable to very poor.  Few scenes actually appear to be high definition with a crisp, clear image, while most of the footage is very grainy.  Realize that this is a result of how the film was made, the cameras that were used, and there was apparently no effort put into cleaning up the image.  It's not just the night scenes, or the action scenes, that the poor picture quality appears in, but also in well-lit interior scenes where the camera is steady,  The claim on the packaging of ""perfect picture"" is simply not the case here, but the little mini-review on the cover that says ""Gritty, thrilling"" seems to have been the actual review of the image quality.

The blu-ray does have features that you cannot find on the dvd version of the film, such as a picture-in-picture track with extra footage, interviews, and making-of material.  However, the dvd version does include the same audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Bottom line is, the reason I buy blu-ray versions of film is because I want a picture quality that is superior to dvd... that is the feature that I'm willing to spend an extra ten bucks on.  Unfortunately, this blu-ray does not deliver a picture quality that is any better than what you can find in the dvd version.

The movie was nicely paced, and the plot easy to follow. Neither Matt Damon nor Greg Kinnear gave stellar performances, but the Bourne Identity series wasn't great cinema either. If you want a fast-action thriller, you will enjoy this. It's a bit unlikely, as several have noted, but that's inherent in the genre.

Politics last. I can't think why people have been getting so worked up over the film. It dealt rather straightforwardly with (1) the fact that no WMDs were ever found, (2) as most military and political analysts believe, it was a big mistake to disband the Iraqi armed forces, (3) the mainstream media rather uncritically joined the cheerleading for the war.

The movie offers the uncontroversial proposition that the CIA screwed up, which is a conclusion reached even by the Bush administration and their supporters. The sole reference to Bush is the ""Mission Accomplished"" event that he himself staged. If the movie had suggested that Bush and/or Cheney knew that there were no WMDs (which I happen to personally believe), that *would* have been controversial. But it doesn't.

If the liberals want to make a point, do it without me wasting $4.99.  I'm still waiting for Hollywood to make a movie out of that glorious Jimmy Carter rescue or Clinton's attack on a small place to divert attention from his affairs and possible impeachment.  So glad I didn't buy this video (btw, the grainy texture was terrible).

WMDs?  Not finding does mean non-existent.  I've never seen a polar bear with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they're there nonetheless. We took out a dictator, and now the people in Iraq have a say over their own lives.  Why don't you show that, Hollywood?",1277596800,13,949,4.589285714285714

What novelist Rajiv Chandrasekran (""Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone"") from which the movie is adapted, screenwriter Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential, Mystic River, Taking of Pelham 123) and director Paul Greengrass (the Bourne series of suspense thrillers, United 93, etc) have elected to show us is a moment in time in the fighting in Iraq when one man has the courage to go against the press (current journalism having stooped to an all time low in erroneously informing the public that Bush's concept of WMD was true and stood their ground in Iraq to continue the myth) and the military to seek out the truth from those Iraqis whose words in Washington DC had been ignored.

Chief Miller (Matt Damon) is the resolute hero of the story and his commitment to uncover the truth about WMD is the line of action the movie takes. The 'mouth' of the lies about WMD is in the person of journalist Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) and the dodgy perpetrator of the nose of the press is Wall Street Journalist Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan).  There is a man - one Martin Brown (Brendan Gleason) - who knows the truth, and it is his encouragement to uncover that truth that engages the quiet but driven Miller to finish the mission.  The idea is to find General Al Rawi (Yigal Naor), the man who in Washington DC told the higher ups that there were no WMD and whose words were twisted to suit the blind ambition of the US Military and Bush, and allow him to tell the truth.  Miller's main assist comes from a simple Iraqi citizen 'Freddy' (Khalid Abdalla) who guides Miller beacuse of Freddy's ambition to save his country.  Tying the action of Miler's confrontation with Al Rawi with the concurrent video clips of Bush aboard the USS Lincoln announcing to the world that the WMD had been found and destroyed and that the US was victorious in the war makes for movie journalism statement at its best.

There are problems with the film: the unrelenting noise and sequences of fighting without pauses for reflection make the film forget to slip in characterization details that would have helped the story; the musical score by John Powell just doesn't match the action; the rapid edits and the fact that most of the film is an extended nocturnal chase become wearing.

4024592,5,B002ZG97RY,"The year 2010 could be the begining for Action Movies to be discarded in Hollywood. First we had the amazing EDGE OF DARKNESS with MEL GIBSON that did OK in the box office but this one took the whole bakery as it did very poorly.

The budget for this movie was $100 million and did at the box office around $37 million so ""Houston we have a SERIOUS problem"".

In Hollywood everything goes in cycles. Now we have 3D movies coming back like the latest thing when in fact they've been around since the 70s and 80s. Im making this comment because AVATAR banked $600 million dollars.

Focusing on the positive - This is an amazing action movie by Matt Damon and the director of the last 2 Bourne Identity movies. It is non stop action from begining to end. Its about the war in IRAQ and it reminds me a bit of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN because is very intense.

Again, I have no idea why it did so bad at the box office when in fact the movie is very very good.

It takes alot of twists and turns and you don't know who to like or who to trust! It has a good story but my major problem was with the filming! I think their approach was to make you feel as if you were there. I did not. I felt nausea and headache. All in all it's ok.

4024595,4,B002ZG97RY,"Don't let some critics fool you, Green Zone is one of the MOST American films you'll see. I'm glad I live in a country where we can question our government without being punished or killed. In fact, we don't use that particular freedom quite enough.

Green Zone walks a tricky line. It attempts to veil a fictional action movie over a very touchy event. That event is the invasion of Iraq and specifically the reason for invasion. We were told there were WMD's in Iraq. I personally feel we were told this in a way that struck fear in our country. When we invaded there were none to be found. Now, feel free to argue that point, but it's a fact. Were there other weapons there that cause destruction of some kind? I'm sure there were. That's to be expected. Citizen's of America, however, were led to believe there were weapons there that could cause destruction on the scale of nuclear or biochemical. Those weren't found. Now, from here on out, one has to be careful. There is nothing more being asserted. There is no argument that Saddam Hussein isn't evil, no argument that Iraq never had WMD's or possibly moved them before the invasion, no argument against the horrible things that were going on in Iraq. All we ask as citizens of this great country is that when our government goes to war and puts our youth in danger, they better tell the truth about why they're doing it. Politically speaking, that is what Green Zone is trying to say. It portrays the anger many people feel about being misled. If you think that is anti-american then I have to question your definition of American. To blindly follow your country is one of the most anti-american things I can think of. The film makes other comments on missteps during the invasion, such as dismissing the Iraqi army and leaving them unemployed and agitated, and I can go on to talk about them but I'm here to critique a film.

If you liked any of Paul Greengrass' previous films, especially the Bourne sequels, I see no reason why you wouldn't thoroughly enjoy Green Zone. It is taut, exciting and kept me engaged and guessing all the way until the end. Greengrass employs the same shaky hand-held camera work that he always has and in a film set amongst the confusion of war it has never been more effective.

One of my favorite aspects of Green Zone is the subplot of Freddy. Freddy is an Iraqi citizen who approaches Miller and his unit (while they are at another site containing no WMD's) with information about a meeting occurring of suspected high priority targets. After the invasion of the meeting, and the discovery that Hussein's top ranking general was there, the film's spider web cover-up plot takes off as Miller slowly peels back the layers of what's really going on. What is so interesting about Freddy is that he personifies the complications of the occupation. He also has one of the most powerful lines of the film. Miller continually states how he is there to do his job; find WMD's and save lives, but Freddy is there to remind him (and us) that it is a little more complicated than that.

The story line of Green Zone has many ins and outs. In other hands the film could have become confusing and irritating but the story is told with great ease by director Paul Greengrass and writer Brian Helgeland. One way to do this, which has been portrayed as a negative by many critics, is one dimensional characters and simple yet powerful dialogue. That way, there is less to get in the way. Let me be clear though, the characters are in no way dull, boring or poorly written. I think a better way to describe them, and the film as a whole, is focused.

I think in order to enjoy this film, you really have to go into it with an open mind. I say that to both sides of the argument. If you completely disagree with my second paragraph above, you could still enjoy the film as it is a thriller, not a documentary. Even if you agree with the assertions of the film, you also have to realize that it is a work of fiction and not something to use to further your contentions. Bottom line: Green Zone is a very effective thriller that was a blast to watch.

The very annoying shaky camera effects are back in play for this movie, and to me the plot for this movie wasn't all that interesting.

In real life, it was a failure as no WMD's were found. This movie went all out in Hollywood fashion as we uncover the truth as to why the war started in the first place and the waste of resource used by the government for the search of the hidden WMD's in Iraq. Many lives from both sides were lost during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, all for something that doesn't exists in the country, the WMD's..

4024754,5,B002ZG97RY,"""Green Zone"" is an exciting, realistic movie with a plausible 'what if' scenario based upon the search for Weapons of Mass Destruction immediately following the start of the Iraqi War. The story follows the efforts of Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) and his team as they go from one WMD site to the next without success. After the third site, at which soldiers in the combat unit providing cover for the WMD Team get wounded, Chief Miller questions Command about the validity of his team's WMD intel and the WMD intel source. At the same time, a local approaches Chief Miller with information about the location of one of Saddam's top generals. ""Green Zone"" then offers a 'what if' scenario that takes responsibility and blame for the Iraqi War away from President Bush/the Bush Administration and ties it to an ambitious Middle East bureaucrat--and Washington liaison--played by Greg Kinnear. The rest of the film is an exhilarating and deadly two-way race at night through the Baghdad streets by Chief Miller (helped by a C.I.A. Official) and a Special Forces officer (under direction of the Greg Kinnear character) to find the Iraqi General. Chief Miller's orders are to bring the General in alive for questioning, and the Special Forces officer has been ordered to kill the General. There is a twist in the film which I won't spoil, except to say I didn't see it coming, but I should have.

The unfortunate fact is that ""Green Zone,"" one of the best and most realistic 'soldier' films I've seen in a long time, was undermined by ignorant people who assumed the film would be nothing but 'Bush Bashing' and propaganda. The film is neither, and it plays fair. The only soap box related to the film is the one used by flag-waving patriots--people who had no intention of ever seeing the film, but wanted to make sure no one else saw it either--prior to its opening. They labeled the film 'Leftest Propaganda' and 'America Bashing,' which the film certainly isn't, and accused Matt Damon of pushing his personal 'political views' down the throats of 'real' Americans. The only thing Matt Damon 'pushed' in ""Green Zone"" was one of the best performances of his career--that no one bothered to see.

STARRING: Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Brendan Gleeson, Khalid Abdalla, Jason Isaacs, Amy Ryan, Yigal Naor, Said Faraj, Nicoye Banks and Jerry Della Salla

WRITTEN BY: Brian Helgeland; based on the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone by Rajiv Chandrasekaran

Genre: Action / Thriller
Release Date: 12 March 2010

When Chief Warrant Officer Miller stumbles across a stench infested pile of pigeon droppings, rather than the nuclear warheads he was told he'd find, he's pretty pissed off. Matt Damon stars as Miller in Green Zone; the latest action thriller from the director of the last two Jason Bourne films, Paul Greengrass.

The timeline has us back in 2003. We are in Iraq and we're on the hunt for WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) with Chief Miller, of the U.S. Army.

Miller gets bold when some of his men are killed at the pigeon-scat sighting, and squares off with his superiors to include a two star General. Miller suspects that there is a glitch in our Intel source, as this is the third wild `pigeon' chase, he's been sent on. He's told otherwise, and advised to not ask questions and to do as he's told. This is about - oh say, 12 minutes into the film, and up to and including this point, it's been believable.

It's not the fact that Miller decides to take matters into his own hands that I had a problem with, so much as the way he does it; which was extremely over the top. I've never been to Iraq, but I did serve in Afghanistan, and I'm sure the specifics of how the Military handles things in general, are probably pretty similar. So for me, seeing Miller tell his troops to abandon their post, and to follow a tip from a local Iraqi citizen named Freddy, by driving in his private vehicle, as well as another one that they steal for God's sakes - is just ridiculous!

It makes for a fun jolt forward in the film, even I can admit, but come on! A soldier actually bashes in the window of an Iraqi citizen's pick-up truck, with the butt of his rife in broad day-light, in front of everyone, and steals it! As if this wasn't Looney Tunes enough on its own, Miller actually yells at one of his troops for questioning his order by saying, ""Put your f**king game face on!"" A great movie line for sure, but absolutely absurd! In the Military there is a little thing called `a lawful order.' Meaning, any order that is lawful, must be carried out by the lower ranking person. If that order is unlawful, as clearly was the case here, then you don't have to follow it! All of Miller's guys see no harm in this whatsoever, and go along with it.

The superb actor that played Freddy (Khalid Abdalla), was more than convincing with the info he gives to Miller; so I get why he believed him. Freddy says he has just seen an important meeting taking place between several really bad men. The reason for the privately owned vehicles rather than the up-armored Humvees they abandon is to not blow their cover; makes sense.

But then we see them kick the doors down and bust into the place, like it's an episode of Cops, or something! I guess no-one in the film is worried about video footage, or having to explain what the hell they were doing there to begin with, to their own chain of command. And conveniently, the film never requires them to. No-one ever finds out about this, even after a firefight ensues, resulting in casualties. Right.

I'm totally onboard with Miller's character, I really am. There is nothing more frustrating than having to bite your tongue in the Military, and being treated like a child in regards to lack of an explanation to things that you are more than capable of understanding. But the movie goes way too Hollywood here. Miller reports to no-one, and no Military personnel ever interfere with him. He's simply allowed to go out and do whatever he wants with whatever equipment he wants, and with whatever soldiers he wants to put in harms way. The film sets up Iraq to be like a playground that Miller can frolic around in whenever he wishes.

The guy is a Chief Warrant Officer, but he's not a God. I worked with a Chief Warrant Officer, who was also in the Army, and whose name ironically was also Miller. I drank with the man, played cards with the man, and went outside the wire with him, so I knew him pretty well. And being a writer, I paid close attention to what his rank and position allotted him to do. Our mission was to protect four star Generals, we were their personal protection team, and my Chief never had the freedom Miller has here. You can't just exit the green zone whenever you like. It's just bananas how ridiculous this is! The guy is let loose like he's Rambo or something! It simply would not happen.

Aside from this, and the film's unrelenting theme (that our government lied about WMDs to have their war); the film is fantastic; tons of action driven suspense. Being written by one of the best screenwriter's Hollywood has ever seen, (Brian Helgeland), it's no wonder. Payback, Assassins, Conspiracy Theory, The Postman, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Mystic River, Man on Fire and L.A. Confidential are only but a few of his legacies.

I have ragged on Damon's character Miller, but truly only for believability purposes. Cinematically, he's awesome, and Damon is perfect for the role. I like that we never really understand why Miller is so caught up in finding out the truth to these supposed weapons. By that I mean, there is no Hollywood back-story that fuels his rage to find answers. Not that this is bad in movies, but it's been done. Miller is simply pissed because his guys are dying and he doesn't like being lied to or taken advantage of; something we all can concur with.

The enjoyable dynamic of Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear that we loved in Stuck on You, is back. Kinnear plays the one entity posing a threat to Miller's Easter-egg hunt for clues as his vicious `suit' of a character Poundstone. Poundstone is an agent with more power than he knows what to do with. He even has his own squad of soldiers at his fingertips. The kind of soldiers that don't live in government housing, and aren't required to shave, and have various takes on how to wear their uniforms; the Washington DC kind.

Miller also earns an ally in the CIA, played by Brendan Gleeson, early on in the film. I enjoyed these elements in the film, but again only as fictional plot-points. It's highly unbelievable that a Warrant Officer would be this closely involved with the CIA. That's why they have the CIA; so that they can send in their very own specialists and keep things quiet.

But of course the film needs Damon's character to do it all, to make it more fun, so we go with it. Even when Miller is given a million dollars in cash to offer to a potential source, with going through less than a third grader would need to check out a library book.",1274313600,5,6929,4.525179856115108
4024818,2,B002ZG97RY,"What a huge disappointment.  Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon are an outstanding team when it comes to the Bourne series.  In Green Zone they try to take that same formula and use an important issue like ""Why we went to war"" as a PLOT POINT.  Not only does it cheapen the entire film but the characters are all cookie cutter and the dialogue is even more cliche.  Add on top of that the director's usual frenzied, handheld style during action scenes (which usually works) but here it's almost impossible to tell what's going on.

What a waste of talent across the board.  Even Matt Damon's character has NO CHARACTER.  He's just some random rogue agent whose gone ""off the reservation.""  Why has he done this? Why now?

Basically, this is a lousy grade Z screenplay that they tried to cover up with A grade talent and it ends up being boring, insulting and disappointing.  Regardless of your politics, you'd be better off watching any of the Bourne movies again unless you put this on during a rainy Sunday and nod off to the non-stop nothingness on the couch.

Epic fail.",1273968000,10,1070,4.578947368421052
4024819,4,B002ZG97RY,"This is an edge of your seat thriller, Damon plays Chief warrant officer Roy Miller, tasked in finding WMDs in Iraq, where his superiors give him Intel and he then follows and executes said orders, but the thing is, every site he goes to there are no WMDs... so what is going on? His only ally is CIA guy Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson), who knows Middle Eastern Affairs better than anyone who always seems to be butting heads with Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear), and a reporter who wants the facts, the truth, (Amy Ryan), Pentagon weasel Clark Poundstone has a source code named Magellan, who is telling Poundstone of these alleged WMD sights, but Miller's Team is always turning up nothing. Then it seems Miller's task is to bring in an Iraqi General who may hold the key to what is going on before Poundstone does using a Special Ops Unit at his disposal. The Special Ops Unit is led by Jason Isaacs, a nice small/ cameo role (where the viewer recognizes him but can't quit put a finger on who he is, but definitely seen him in other movies--- played the baddie in The Patriot) His task is to silence Miller following orders from Poundstone.  Poundstone's big picture is political, show the people abroad what they want to hear and see... Gaining a Foot hold and winning the war on Terror, where as it's not that easy for the soldiers on the ground actually doing the real work like Miller and his Team.

Paul Greengrass gives us a movie that touches on this hot topic of the Iraqi War. Where baddies aren't just Insurgents, where good/bad is blurred, obviously I think Kinnear could be deemed the ""bad guy""--- or likes to think he's just doing his job, going into a country thinking to himself it's for the good but ultimately invading a country for all the wrong reasons (sorry to bring in my own beliefs) That's what makes this movie so great. Greengrass portrays the Iraqis with a voice that ultimately once U.S Soldiers pull out it is up to them to forge a new country. There is a nice scene where Miller comes out of the streets into a posh Palace where reporters/ CIA/ top officials are staying, he's all sweaty, dirty, and he looks around and sees a BBQ, sees blond women in the pool, guys in polos lounging, drinking beer, as if Miller just stepped into the Twilight Zone, wanting answers why his sites are turning up empty. These people don't realize what is going on outside these walls.

Damon plays Miller as the usual in control, steady, soldier, wanting the real answers, the facts, no matter how dirty, or right or wrong the answer may be, he just doesn't want to go around Baghdad blind where everything is in the Grey. He really does want to know is there a purpose on why we are here, where I remember a member of Miller's team states, ""The facts don't matter we're here to do a job that's all""-- it was something to that affect and Miller replies, ""It matters to me."" sums up the whole movie right there.

And with any Paul Greengrass movie, we have to have the final show down with shaky camera and all, but as always as tired as it may be, the chase sequence is thrilling, almost heart-stopping.... this is a well made thriller, no matter what your views are on the current situation, check this out.

4024826,5,B002ZG97RY,"After skimming through most of the reviews, I am beginning to wonder why some people go to a moton picture presentation to begin with.  I look at viewing a motion picture, domestic or foreign, as an escape from reality, one professionally filmed and believable, which is the purpose of any movie.  I found Green Zone absorbing, mostly factual (after all, this is Hollywood) with great performances and an edge-of-the seat experience.  As for the political aspects of the story line, if I wanted to whine about who did what wrong in 2001 and disect all the politics and foreign policies, I would check out reference works from the library then go take a university course on foreign relations.  In my view, a must-see presentation, not for the faint of heart.  Maybe civilians wouldn't get the discipline, sacrifice, and dedication displayed in the movie, but to anyone who has served in any military service successfully, it is reminiscent of what it is to be disciplined, both as a leader and a follower, and to possibly sacrifice one's self to achieve victory.",1271203200,12,1062,4.877777777777778
4024827,4,B002ZG97RY,"""Green Zone"" is the latest film starring Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, who worked together in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum.""

Damon plays US Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller, who leads a team of soldiers tasked with finding Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)s in Iraq in 2003. Every site that intelligence sends them to turns out to have no WMDs. Frustration growing, Miller discovers two unlikely allies, a CIA agent played by Brendan Gleason who disapproves of the US's approach in finding the WMDs, and a Wall Street Journal reporter, played by Amy Ryan, who alerts Miller that the intelligence his unit is using is being provided by a top-secret informant named Magellan. Miller soon figures out that a Pentagon official played by Greg Kinnear knows who Magellan is, but Kinnear's character thwarts Miller's effort to get to the truth at every turn. Jason Isaacs plays a Special Forces officer who does Kinner's bidding in concealing the truth.

This is a tense, exhilirating and tough-as-nails thriller with great performances by the entire cast. This is a movie that will grow in appreciation the further we get away from the events in Iraq.",1270080000,2,1182,5.025510204081633
4024898,4,B002ZG97RY,"Matt Damon stars in this Paul Greengrass movie as Chief Warrant Officer Miller, set in 2003, a unit tasked with finding Weapons of Mass Destruction. As the reader may recall, our President Bush led us to war in Iraq because their WMD's posed a major threat to America and the world.

Matt Damon also stared in the Jason Bourne series by the same director. Miller and his team risk life and limb going into hot urban Iraqi war zone only to come up emptyhanded time after time. Miller starts to question the Intelligence which said these sites contained WMP's. He asked his commanders, the CIA and a Bush administration official to see the Intelligence reports or talk to the source who provided them.  Iraq locals like ""Freddy"" (believably played by Khalid Abdalla) help Miller and group, but he keeps in mind what he thinks is good for his country.

There are plenty of fights, thrills and plenty of chases as this war movie/spy/mystery goes along. It held my attention to the end. If this wasn't shot in Baghdad, it certainly looks like it.

Miller single-mindedly pursues his conclusions. This movie and its' motivation make a lot more sense than the Jason Bourne series, where characters were friends in one scene, enemies in another, then friends. This is a problem in many recent movies, for example ""Sherlock Holmes"". But not here. This plot makes sense!

My biggest problem with this movie is Greengrass's use of hand held cameras and available light shooting. The camera work through the chase scenes where these are used is herky jerky and so bad it was making me nauseous. I finally removed my glasses and the softer focus made the chase scenes easier to watch. Also available light shooting at night places the camera in the digital noise range and the shots are full of blotchy blocks of color. Greengrass used the same jerky, choppy camera technique in the Bourne series, then shot with multiple cameras and excessive editting. deduct one star.

Think of an America president committing American lives and treasure to war in Iraq, searching everywhere for weapons of mass destruction while ignoring the real threat to America, free market idealogs promoting credit default swaps that destroy the Wealth of Nations!

Matt Damon does a great job, more coherent than Bourne. Worth seeing in a theater.",1269561600,8,2311,4.880102040816326
4024899,5,B002ZG97RY,"The Movie was excellent and well worth the price.  I have requested the Blu Ray when it becomes available.  I recommend this movie for everyone to see, especially the young teen generation, it was very educational and make the viewer want to have a good debate with someone else.",1269475200,5,279,4.673469387755102
4024900,5,B002ZG97RY,"When the credits rolled this afternoon, a gentlemen sitting behind me had to take a deep breath. ""Man, I'm just worn out from watching the movie."" I agreed with him.

This movie has all the excitement of the Jason Bourne series: hot action scenes, great sound editing, a tight script, a stellar soundtrack and excellent acting by everyone in the film, and I mean everyone!

But I couldn't handle all the camera shakes. In fact, half the movie is like this. I understand Hollywood is lately using hand-carried, un-dollyed camera techniques to create the sense of chaos and panic in a film, but this was just too much. It was like being on a roller coaster ride with the scene moving violently and not you. I regretted eating that pack of Skittles just before the film started. When I got home, I simply had to lie down for an hour.

It's a shame because the story is brilliant, and I love Matt Damon's strong acting style. If you're a fan of the Jason Bourne films, this is right up your alley, but you might want to bring a vomit bag with you. Then again...maybe not.

I was puzzled why Green Zone didn't do so well at the Box Office on its opening weekend; now, I understand why. It's not the film...it's the filming.

Wonderful, wonderful story, but it's just nauseating to watch...literally. Too bad.

I'm glad the movie wasn't in 3D. I wouldn't be able to handle it.",1269388800,191,1370,4.504032258064516
4024901,5,B002ZG97RY,"In ""The Green Zone"" Matt Damon is quite a rebel, on a one-man crusade to change American foreign policy in Iraq. He's an army chief warrant officer assigned to find Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) caches, but he soon realizes the intell he's been given is bogus stuff so he takes it upon himself to veer off course and get involved in stuff not part of his mandate. It's action-packed, and it gives the feeling of what Iraq was like in the early days. It's very authentic looking and compliments ""The Hurt Locker"" which deals with a much smaller aspect of the war and gets into the head of one monomaniacal soldier. This is more external stuff.
 Damon's character is a pretty shrewd guy and seems to be operating way above his pay grade. The movie has a single-minded focus on conspiracies and doesn't bother with love interest.
 I found it quite absorbing and interesting because of the wider political aspects it covered. There's no time in the movie to do any deep probing of character psychology, but it proves once again that the ordinary American citizen is not only brainy but quite able to take on the establishment, quite unusual for a member of the armed forces, but part of the great American tradition of the independence and courage, one might even say recklessness, of the average Joe.
 The movie has a well-constructed plot. Damon meets up with an informer who's willing to give him inside dope, but of course he's fighting a battle with a defense department civilian (Greg Kinnear) who has an agenda to adhere to. The CIA guy, a very bulky Brendan Gleeson, is the good guy, and is working with Damon.
 It's an interesting movie, fast-paced, and with serious implications. You see the suffering of the Iraqis and the way the Green Zone in Baghdad is isolated and insulated from the country's people.
 It's one of the newer genres of American films in which the good guys and the bad guys are both Americans fighting turf battles.",1269302400,11,1946,4.678362573099415
4024902,3,B002ZG97RY,"Matt Damon is okay, but the script is weak. So so watch. Not as good as the Bourne movies. Also, the action is brief. I would say rental.",1268784000,8,137,3.9285714285714284
4024903,1,B002ZG97RY,I shall pass on this one. I saw a short clip on Bill O'Rielly and the camera was bouncing all over the place. This may be a lovely new technique for some but it makes me sick!,1268697600,15,175,3.7567567567567566
4024904,3,B002ZG97RY,"""Green Zone"" stars Matt Damon as Warrant Officer Roy Miller, leader a battalion in 2003 Iraq charged with finding the elusive ""weapons of mass destruction.""  However, every time they are given intelligence, it turns out to be wrong.  Extremely wrong.  Toilet factory wrong.  Miller starts to question his superiors about the source of the intel, which raises some hackles, but also attracts the interest of the CIA bureau chief in Baghdad, Martin Brown (played by Brendan Gleeson).  Miller's frustration mounts when his team is sent to what turns out to be a playground; however, his luck turns when a local resident approaches the team and informs them about a meeting of high-level Iraqis just down the street.  Miller is skeptical but decides to investigate, and his team stumbles upon the number two man in Saddam Hussein's toppled government.  Unfortunately, not everyone in the allied forces is pleased, and Miller finds himself not knowing who to trust and at the center of a confusing web of intelligence.

At this point, quite a few movies have been made about the Iraqi war, all focusing on slightly different aspects of the war and with different political slants and agendas.  The best of these movies (Stop-Loss, The Hurt Locker) have taken on very specific aspects of the war and informed the public.  ""Green Zone"" attempts to take on a broader and more controversial issue - whether we should have been there in the first place and whether the intelligence that led us into Iraq was good.  Unfortunately, the plot details regarding that issue are fictionalized.  So what is the purpose?  The movie cannot illuminate for us whether we should have engaged in this war, so it serves only to add fuel (fictionalized fuel!) to the fire for those who have argued that the war was started under false pretences.

Of course, war movies have long served as entertainment, and ""Green Zone"" was brought to us by the same team (Damon and director Paul Greengrass) who made ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" so one might expect a smashing good thriller.  As such, ""Green Zone"" is fairly well done.  There are some exciting segments where Miller slowly realizes what is happening as well as a few decent action scenes.  However, it's a much noisier and chaotic and therefore less enjoyable film than any of the Bourne series, and it never develops the tension those movies instill.  Also, let's face it - the superior Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" elevated the war genre; ""Green Zone"" feels surprisingly old-fashioned and pointless in contrast.  ""Green Zone"" is ultimately a decent, above average thriller but don't expect much else.",1268524800,19,2653,4.988636363636363
4024905,1,B002ZG97RY,"Here we go again .. yet another example of Hollywood in all it's ignorance of real world intelligence and history making a movie that is nothing more than a thinly veiled propoganda tool.

It seems guys like Damon, Clooney and others have confused their ability to act and make believe in the world of film making with the complexities of the real world.

An otherwise potentially good film plot was ruined by this movie's overbearing preaching, conspiracy theory perpetuation and excessive left leaning political slant.

It is always better when film makers lift themselves ABOVE mundane daily politics and have their movies portray Universal Values and messages.

Instead, this film gets sucked into the muck and mire of the daily politics we see in the world of FOX NEWS -vs-  CNN NEWS.  As a result it gets warped into nothing more than an excuse for some film makers in Hollywood to vent their political views and stand on a soapbox for 100 minutes trying to sway public sentiment to their way of thinking.

Pretty forgettable.  This film will probably make less than $40 million and dissapear from people's minds in less than 30 days.",1268524800,26,1140,4.84020618556701
4024906,4,B002ZG97RY,"Matt Damon has become one of the most politically active Hollywood types out there so you know a film about Iraq with him in the lead role is going to have a strong message. This is of course the case with 'Green Zone.' Damon plays Chief Roy Miller, a US Army WMD specialist whose unit scours Baghdad for the weapons in the opening weeks of the current Iraq war. Paul Greengrass, who did the last two Bourne films with Damon, directed this, and like Bourne Ultimatum, GZ has much of the shaky handheld camera work that makes the film a bit difficult to watch at times. Not recommended if you suffer from motion sickness. That being said, it was a decent but not exceptional film. Basically, Miller finds out he is on a wild goose chase to find the WMDs and once he discovers that the whole reason for the invasion is basically bogus, he decides to do something about it. I like Brendan Gleason (he plays a CIA officer here) but I thought his accent was horrible here which threw off his whole performance. Damon, Kinnear and others give good performances but I thought the film's message was a bit too blatant and redundant. That being said, the film puts the lie to those who would accuse the war criticizers or skeptics of not ""supporting the troops."" If anything, it's a condemnation of those who callously put our heroic men and women in harm's way for the sake of achieving their own political purposes. 3.5 stars",1268524800,9,1418,4.521400778210117
4024907,5,B002ZG97RY,"""Green Zone"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: During the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad in 2003, Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his team of Army inspectors were dispatched to find weapons of mass destruction believed to be stockpiled in the Iraqi desert. Rocketing from one bobby-trapped and treacherous site to the next, the men search for deadly chemical agents but stumble instead upon an elaborate cover-up that inverts the purpose of their mission. Spun by operatives with intersection agendas, Miller must hunt through covert and faulty intelligence hidden on foreign soil for answers that will either clear a rogue regime or escalate a war in an unstable region. And at this blistering time and in this combustible place, he will find the most elusive weapon of all is the truth.

The cast led by Matt Damon (as Roy Miller) is excellent! The directing by Paul Greengrass (who also directed ""United 93"" (2006, also produced and wrote the story & screenplay), ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2002, also starring Damon) & ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007, also starring Damon) is excellent! The story and screenplay (based on part by the book ""Imperial Life In The Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone"" by Rajiv Chandrasekaran) by Brian Helgeland (who also did the screenplay to ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997, also co-produced), ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997, also wrote the story), ""Payback"" (1999, also directed), ""A Knight's Tale"" (2001, also wrote the story, produced & directed), ""Mystic River"" (2003), ""Man On Fire"" (2004), ""The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3"" (2009), the upcoming ""Robin Hood"" (2010, also wrote the story) & ""Salt"" (2010) is excellent!

The film editing by Christopher Rouse (who also co-produced) (who also did the film editing to ""The Italian Job"" (2003), ""The Bourne Supremacy & Ultimatum"", he won the Oscar for his work on ""Ultimatum"" & ""United 93"") is excellent! The casting by Daniel Hubbard, John Hubbard (both of them did the casting to ""The Bourne Supremacy & Ultimatum""), Amanda Mackey Johnson & Cathy Sandrich (all 4 did the casting to ""United 93"") is excellent!
