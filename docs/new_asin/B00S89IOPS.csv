6964458,5,B00S89IOPS,"It's nice to have every episode and TV movie of MacGyver available to watch whenever I want to. I wish the video quality was a tad better though. This show was edited on videotape -- as was standard practice in the '80s -- and it shows. You're not going to get a high-def picture, but using the video filters in my upconverting Blu-Ray player and Sony LCD HDTV render a watchable image. You gotta consider that this show is 30 years old, and people had small, low-resolution CRT TVs back then. We do get closed captions here, which is. I would have liked an interview or commentary with Richard Dean Anderson, but, oh well.",1432080000,12,623,4.473684210526316

6964462,4,B00S89IOPS,"MacGyver was a show airing in the late 80s that was about a Special Agent working for the Phoenix Foundation, who solves problems across the globe.  Due to his scientific background,  MacGyver has become a cultural icon by way of being a master of improvisation with common materials.  If you mention his name, many will immediately think of him creating a bomb out of a everyday materials, usually a stick of gum, a paper clip, and duct tape.  Fans will talk about his preference of using non-violence to solve problems or complain about his mysterious first name which was revealed in the final season.  Lost to casual viewers though are his interactions with the youth community within the shows universe, his personal demons of past events, and his dedication to his friendsno matter how much they continue to get him in to trouble. Lasting for 7 seasons and two tv movies, MacGyver used his brain and intellect to save the day.

Originally, the show was released on DVD in single season box sets with slim cases.  Each case had a short episode summary and the DVDs had color graphics depicting many everyday tools that MacGyver would use.  Later a Complete Series set was release with horrible packaging where the DVDs were loose and only a portion of the DVDs had color graphics on them while the others had generic gray labeling.

Now Paramount has re-released the series in better packing.  Called The Complete Collection, this new set is packaged with a large box which contains two large clear plastic cases.  Season 1-4 are in the first case and Season 5-7 and the two telemovies are in the second case.  Both cases have the large removable flip holders (not a spindle) and the second case is noticeably smaller due to housing less DVDs.  The total box set measures approximately  4.5 inch (11.5cm) across, which is nice but doesnt really save you that much on self space. If you own all of the original season sets and movie, they measure about 7.5 inches (19cm).  The interior has an episode listing of each disc, but only contains the episode title (no air dates, no summary). Each DVD has a generic gray labeling with the season, disc number, and episode listing for that disc.  Currently, as noted in other reviews, the first disc of season 1 is mislabeled as having the titles of the first disc of the 5th season; however, the actual first four episodes of Season 1 are on the disc.  For those who might ask, the first disc of season 5 is ok and has the correct episodes on it.  And as of yet, there has been no plans for a disc exchange.

The DVDs themselves are the exact pressings from previous sets, but they all now have the generic labeling.  The content of multiple discs from the original season sets were compared to this set and they are the exact same material.  As an example: Season 1 Disc 1 in this set has the same promos for Paramounts Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and Mork & Mindy that was originally on Disc 1 from the Season 1 box set.

There has been no increase of quality on the episodes and the original close captioning are still there.  No further bonus features are added.
While the packaging is an improvement over the previous complete series set, it is still lacking.  First, an episode guide would have been helpful, even the one from the previous complete set would have worked.  The casual viewer wouldnt be able to decipher what exactly Soft Touch was or even Deathlock without searching the internet.  Second, the mistake in the printing of the first disc was kind of unsettling, in that I expected a few more issues with the set.  I briefly looked at the other discs and this appears to be the only mistake.  And finally, there are no extras and no real reason to purchase if you already have the originals.  Adding a Look Back documentary or even the Young MacGyver unaired pilot would have been nice, but it is just another missed opportunity.  So if you own the original sets, then there is no real need to purchase this one unless you want a little less shelf space, are replacing the poorly designed Complete Series, or just want to own all versions because you have to have all MacGvyer related material.",1428969600,141,4164,4.610583446404342

6964464,4,B00S89IOPS,"Season 1 Disc 1 has a misprint. The episode list on the disc should read:
  Pilot
  The Golden Triangle
  Thief of Budapest
  The Gauntlet

Instead, it lists the episodes from Season 5 Disc 1:
  Legend of the Holy Rose Part 1
  Legend of the Holy Rose Part 2
  The Black Corsage
  Cease Fire

Despite the bad label on Season 1 Disc 1, all four episodes that are actually on the disc are correct and play fine. Labels are easy to overlook, but are very important for series releases like this. It would be fair to provide verified buyers with a free replacement disc that has the correct label.",1428710400,36,593,4.333333333333333

6964478,1,B00S89IOPS,In season six there are two missing episodes as two discs have an episode twice. The missing episodes are Harry's Will and Squeeze Play; unfortunately these episodes are missing from the individual season six as well.,1518048000,,217,5.055555555555555
6964479,4,B00S89IOPS,"I received this collection a month or two ago and have absolutely loved watching it.

My main problem is that when I got to Season 6 - Disc 2, ""Harry's Will"" is not on there. It's on the title screen but when I go to play the episode it's the ""Lesson in Evil"" episode.

So that means that Lesson in Evil is on the same disc twice!

I was super bummed out because that is the episode I was really looking forward to.

Anyone else have this issue? Or did I just get a funky disc?",1516320000,,477,3.9375

6964481,5,B00S89IOPS,"It's MacGyver. Need I say more? And the price was pretty good too. It also includes the 2 movies as well. Very nice! Just remember this is 80's and early 90's TV. It doesn't play well on high def, or ultra high def anything. U'll have to reduce resolution settings on ur LED monitors to meet that era of 500 lines of resolution (CRT settings). For my monitor that works out to 1280 x 960. That gives you essentially full screen without any of those annoying black bars. And since this is classic 80's and 90's tv, don't expect the video quality to always hold up. This was shot in the analog era (film), before digital tv. So some of the scenes can get a little messy in this digital ultra high def world.  But there's simply no other show quite like it. The reason it got bought is it went off another streaming service, and finally bored with nothing like it, I popped for the series. No regrets at all.",1513641600,,905,4.292397660818714

That is not what arrived. We received a DVD box set that included only the first four seasons on 22 discs and no TV movies. We are not happy at all and wish to receive the rest of our order. 1 star until the full order is received. Thank you.

Update: Amazon rectified the of order quickly. However, the final disk that includes the two made for TV movies came literally stuck to the back of the DVD case.

6964488,1,B00S89IOPS,"This is review speaks to the quality of the disks, not the TV show on them.  In short these disk are cheaply made and barely functional.  I could not play them in my normal player. I had to go buy a blu-ray player. Little bit stronger laser and they played, but just barely. On one disk about season 5 or 6'ish, I couldn't even get all the episodes to even play.  3 episodes seem to be complete lost on these disks and will not play no matter what player i used.

Cheap quality disks made just to grab a buck. You would be better off waiting to buy digital versions or wait for a collectors edition if they even publish one.  These disks are crap and you will be disappointed.",1502409600,2,676,4.1692307692307695

6964498,4,B00S89IOPS,"For those of you who don't want to take the time to read my whole review, here is a synopsis:
-The box itself is very flimsy and not well made, but it will do the job if you're careful.
-Season 1-4 are in one plastic dvd case and Season 5-7 + the TV movies are in the other.
-Total of 39 dvds housed in plastic, removable flip holders. Exercise caution, may break.
-TV movie is on one disc that is simply affixed to the back of the Season 5-7 case with a sticky piece of mounting tape. It will probably come off and rattle around, so go get it a separate case for it and it house it separately.
-All episodes are present and play, including episodes that some other people said they were missing or that would not play.
-Quality is what you SHOULD except out of an old tv show. It is not HD. If you love Mac, then you will not care.

Packaging:
 The box itself is not good quality. It is a very flimsy, foldable pop-up box (you could unfold it yourself). It is unlike my other boxed sets, one of which is just a plastic case and the others are thicker, actual cardboard boxes. This box could be ripped by hand. The corners of mine were already worn when it arrived from shipping, so be cautious. If you are careful with it, it should be fine. The designs on the outside are not good. It is a combination of episode screenshots, badly photoshopped pictures and explosions all on a background of a grid pattern and cityscape. The designs don't really matter; what matters is the episodes themselves, but it would have been nice if CBS DVD could have come up with a better design featuring original images instead of bad photoshop jobs. The box measures about 4.1 inches (10.5 cm) across the spine, and about 5.5 inches (14 cm) across the front. It stands about 7  inches (19.5 cm) tall.
 The box contains two plastic dvd cases. The first one contains Season 1-4 and the second one contains Season 5-7 + the two TV movies. The case for Season 1-4 is still photoshopped promotional pictures on the front, and original promotional pictures and episode screenshots on the back. The use of random images of people hanging from planes, riding dirtbikes, swinging from vines, climbing mountains, etc., is odd. The case for Season 5-7 + the TV movies is more of the same: bad photoshop jobs, silhouettes of people performing MacGyver-like stunts, and original, unphotoshopped promotional pictures and episode screenshots on the back.
Once opened, the cases contain plastic, removable flip holders. They are not attached to the spine of the cases. I would recommend caution when flipping through them as they seem like they could break relatively easily and I know some people have already said that theirs broke. Season 1-4 has six wings to the dvd holder, and Season 5-7 + TV movies has four. The dvds can be a little hard to get out, which is good in the way that hopefully they won't just fall out, but it is bad in that you could risk damaging them while trying to get out one to watch. Just exercise caution.
The inside of the slip cover has the season number followed by the names of the episodes, but there is no episode description or original airdate. There is no artwork on the inside of the slip cover minus a stock image of a cityscape running along the bottom. Season 1-4 contains 6 discs for Season 1 and 2, and 5 discs for Season 3 and 4; a total of 22 discs. Season 5-7 contains 6 discs for Season 5 and 6 and 4 discs for Season 7, and 1 disc for the TV movies; a total of 17 discs. All together that equals the correct number of 39 discs in total. The discs are simply grey with shiny letters for the titles.
My main issue with the set came in the packaging of Season 5-7 + the TV Movies. The TV movies are on a separate disc by themselves in the Season 5-7 plastic case. A small dvd holder was stuck on the back by a small, round, sticky pad, similar to foam mounting tape. When my set arrived, the dvd holder had unattached itself and the disc was rattling around inside the packaging. I removed it as soon as I saw the issue, however the disc was already sticky from where it had bumped the sticky pad that it had been supposed to be attached to. It took me several hours to get the disc cleaned of all the sticky residue, but when I finally got it clean the disc did play fine. I put the TV movie disc into a cd holder, but I plan on buying a dvd case and housing it separately from the rest of the boxed set. I would highly recommend other buyers to do the same as the tape that is supposed to hold it will probably not do the job, and you would not want to risk the dvd getting scratched or damaged from rattling around in the case. If you don't want to buy a separate dvd case, then I suggest you MacGyver something to protect that disc.
DVDs:
In Season 1, the first disc (Season 1 Disc1) originally had a misprint. It was labeled as the episodes from Season 5 Disc 1, but this misprint has been corrected. It now correctly displays The Pilot, The Golden Triangle, Thief of Budapest, and The Gauntlet, which are what is actually on the dvd. Some people said that their copies of this set did not contain the episodes Harrys Will or The Coltons, or some people said that their set would not play the episodes on Season 6 Disc 2 (Twenty Questions, The Wall, Lesson in Evil, and Harrys Will). This set DOES CONTAIN the episodes that some people said were missing or would not play. I have checked the dvds to make sure that the audio is in sync with the video (which it appears to be), and I can tell you that all the episodes are present and do play. They are all in the original aired order, except for Season 7 Disc 4, as The Stringer is listed as being the last aired episode, when The Mountain of Youth was actually the last aired episode. It aired on May 21, 1992 and The Stringer aired on April 25, 1992. There are no digital copies with this set, and there is no Play All button on the menu. The promotional ads on the front for Happy Days, Lavern and Shirley, etc., are skippable, but you cannot jump to the menu. You will have to use the skip button. The episodes are in 4:3 ratio. The menus are mostly made of digital graphics with promotional pictures for Season 1-4, then digital graphics with mostly episode screenshots and a few promotional pictures for Season 5-7. Nothing fancy. There is no bonus content, just closed captioning and the previews for other old tv show collections.
DONT EXPECT HD QUALITY. This is an 80s show, so it is not going to be in eye-popping high definition that everyone thinks they must have nowadays. If you really love MacGyver, you won't care. I will note, though, that they are a bit better quality than the reruns of MacGyver that are playing right now on my TV.
 Overall, this is a good set, minus flimsy packaging, terrible artistic designs, and bad housing for the TV movies disc. Hopefully this set should last me a good long while so that I can continue to watch MacGyver outthink the bad guys by coming up with ingenious ideas.",1492905600,3,6992,4.358895705521473

Plus no smartphones or Internet! But after watching it again over 30 years later, I have to say that it hasn't aged very well. The acting is pretty good, but the writing is terrible, with ridiculously unbelievable plots. Typical 80s cheese. MacGyver goes up against armies of armed enemies with no preparation except carrying his Swiss army knife in his pocket, but always comes out triumphant in the end without firing a shot (he doesn't believe in guns) . Lol. And the political correctness liberal agenda frequently portrayed is also ridiculous. MacGyver makes it very clear he is a tree-hugging environmentalist who is anti-tobacco, anti-alcohol, and anti-gun. This show might be good for young viewers under 16 who don't know a good show from a bad one, but older adults looking to relive their childhood will probably only find bitter-sweet memories.

6964526,5,B00S89IOPS,"What can I say? Give the guy a Swiss army knife and a roll of duct tape and he'd find a way to land on the moon. This was a very quintessentially 80s show, with the good guys won, and that was a good thing. It was light-hearted, but had a great balance of engaging plots without the melodrama that has been present in many of the popular shows that are produced today. The closest analogy with todays TV shows would be CBSs Scorpion. That only became true after Les Moonves killed off the very promising Limitless even after renewing shows having lower ratings... Now CBS wants to come in and re-make (ABCs) 80s classic MacGyverI'll give it a chance, but the first two episodes are not looking good...",1475366400,2,701,4.441860465116279

6964537,5,B00S89IOPS,"MacGyver is a great series. I watched some when it was first out and loved it and I still do. It's clean, has a good perspective on life while being exciting. Richard Dean Anderson is awesome in the part. He's my favorite actor. I've loved him since Macgyver and most of the things he acts in are good shows. In fact, they use a lot of things from his real life in MacGyver which made it that much more real and likeable. A good show for the whole family. I wish they had made more. But 7 seasons was a good length at the time. I heard they are making a remake of MacGyver. I'm looking forward to see if they make as good.",1470009600,,622,4.024193548387097

6964539,5,B00S89IOPS,"Nicely packaged: 1 large box, two albums/cases in the box, each with many discs in individual disc holders, flip style, inside.  No paperwork, no sleeves, no artwork if that matters to you.  Just grey discs, each printed with the Season & disc # and the episodes on that disc (usually 4 episodes per disc).

The downside, to me, is that that there's no ""Play All"" menu selection.  Each episode plays individually and it takes you back to the menu when each is finished, but at least the cursor is on the next episode.  A ""Play All"" option should be the law on all collections!

I noticed the same thing as Lauren from his/her review in Apr 2015, my Season 1, Disc #1 is misprinted as well.  Oh well, I know the pilot and other first 3 episodes are on it, doesn't matter much to me if it's misprinted.  All others seem proper.  VERY happy to have the collection of memories from my youth, and ~$50 is VERY reasonable for that!  This seller should be very happy that Netflix removed MacGyver from it's lineup, which it had been there for many years.  When Netflix dropped it in July 2016, I came searching, and now I own them.  [tongue out at Netflix].

The episodes are not formatted for widescreen, they are in 4:3 square, so unless you have an older TV set, you'll have the side black bars. (Or unless you zoom in on your DVD player settings).

Playback is great, as good as Netflix was, as good as the technology from the 80s was capable of.  Although many times the music and sound effects seem way louder than the voices.  A minor annoyance not always present...might be my TV audio settings too, who knows.

Another annoyance is Season 1, Disc 1 plays 3 loud advertisements for Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and Mork & Mindy at the very startup, and you aren't allowed to skip to the menu.  You can FFWD/Skip, but I still find it obnoxious that they included that on the first disc and can't shortcut through it.",1468800000,4,1918,4.446991404011461

6964554,5,B00S89IOPS,"DVD's
The DVD's are good (so far). There are some labeling issues that I uncovered, but I generally go by the Season/Disc number and not the titles on the individual disk. The series was very good, but also cut short. Still enjoyable to watch after all these years. Back when it was on, I only had 1 VCR and tapes were expensive so one had to be careful about what was recorded and what was skipped.

Packaging: Not very good at all
There are 2 cases for the 7 seasons with the first case holding 4 seasons worth and the second case holding 3 seasons worth. The problem is that the plastic that holds each pair of disks is easy to break away just from flipping through the disks a few times. Over time this will only get worse. I am watching Season 3 now and two of the many tabs have broken loose.

My fix for this was to order a 25 pack of 14mm clear plastic cases that hold 6 DVD's (see: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009XHO7LE?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) I plan on copying the cover art and making 4 sleeves (covers) for the first season with the seasons on the spine (being the only addition), and the same for the 2nd set. I'll keep the original ones around in case I sell the set down the road.

I have enough extra boxes to fix a Matlock box set and a Renegade box set. I can also fix some other cases that have a broken disk tab but no places to put the DVD's in the sides of the case (Rockford Files Movies, 2nd Volume)",1458000000,4,1449,4.359259259259259

The only compensation for him is that his expenses are taken care of and gets bonuses for each job which varies depending on what he wants it to be.  Some episodes deal with real life issues that are found in society like homelessness, racism, alcoholism, Glaucoma, troubled youth and a lot of issues that can be found in this world.

Steve and I would take a paper clip, straighten it out flat, wrap a piece of paper around the center, bend it into a u-shape and then inserted in the nearest available wall plug and blow the breaker for the classroom. Anytime the lights went out in school the teacher was obligated to release us into the wild, ie the hallways. All of Stevens friends really appreciated our little MacGyver isms. Partly why they called us the MacGyver twins! We have never live down that reputation and we continue it to this day, thank you Richard Dean Anderson, you have made us the men that we are today! And still, with a stick of chewing gum, a paper clip, and a piece of belly button lint, we can still save the world! Long live MacGyver! An inspiration to kids around the world to stretch their imagination and find immediate solutions from readily obtainable materials. One of the best shows ever made, in my opinion at least.

6964584,3,B00S89IOPS,"This is NOT a review on MacGyver the TV show as this was a purchase made for a relative who is a fan of MacGyver. This is a review on ""MacGyver: The Complete Collection"" DVD packaging.

Initially, upon opening the box this was sent in, it is a pretty impressive sight. It is a HUGE box. That is where the ""wow"" factor wears off pretty quickly. The outer box is a flimsy thin cardboard type thing. It has a nice printed image on all sides, with technical details shoved to the bottom, the side and top with a simplistic ""MacGyver: The Complete Collection"" logo, and full color rear with your typical spill about it having all the episodes and such. This part isn't the worst deal though, no, the worst part is the cases.

For some reason, the series is presented in 2 multi-disc Amaray box type cases, seasons 1-4 in one, and season 5-7 and the TV movie specials in the other. I feel like it would have been better to present the series in 7 standard size cases for the seasons and one slim case for the movies. No season goes above 6 discs, and the outer box would hold these cases with enough room for a booklet style episode guide, as the pictures I attached show. It even seems like that style would have worked to stabilize the flimsy outer ""box"".

Now, for the price, at least at the now current deal, it is a great deal.",1445817600,13,1326,4.296
