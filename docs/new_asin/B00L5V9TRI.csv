8663966,5,B00L5V9TRI,"I have been looking a long time for a good, real and comprehensive account about the Ottoman Empire and its conquest into the West via the Mediterranean. I have heard and read about this other documentary that was made called ""The Ottoman Empire"", but discovered that it was pulled off the shelves before its official release date due to political sensitivities with the Turkish government. That is unfortunate because based on the reviews of those who were fortunate enough to get advanced copies of the documentary, ""The Ottoman Empire"" was well-made, and vividly honest. Having purchased and viewed ""Ottomans versus Christians: Battle for the Mediterranean"", I believe that this may be the next best alternative to ""The Ottoman Empire"" documentary. It is broken down into 6 half-hour segments:
1) ""Constantinople"" (which looks at the birth of the Ottoman Empire after this city was sieged from the Byzantine Emperor to become their new capital ""Istanbul"" )
2) ""Rhodes"" (which looks at how this Greek island was invaded and taken over by the Ottomans)
3) ""Malta"" (the only island in the Mediterranean that the Ottomans failed to seize)
4) ""Venice"" (the acquisition of this island by the Ottomans)
5) ""Lepanto & Cyprus"" (two island battles that left devastating losses on both the Christian and Ottoman sides)
6) ""End of Empire"" (which looks at how the Ottomans were pushed back East by the Christian coalition armies/navies and helped end the collapse of the Ottoman Empire; the Turkish Revolution within the Ottoman Empire is also credited with making the Empire fall from its former glory)

The creators and producers of this documentary present the events using a succinct but effective combination of political, social, cultural, architectural, military and (briefly) religious perspectives to explain the rise and fall of the Ottoman Empire, and does so without compromising too much the realities of events (even some of the atrocities committed by the Ottomans). To make the 6-part series as balanced as possible, experts from both the Turkish side and the Christian side are interviewed about their understanding of the events in the 16th Century. Still, great care was used to tell as much of the truth as possible, but without offending either side too much.

This documentary truly is an exceptional production and a good overall insight into the what the Ottoman Empire (in the Christian Mediterranean countries) was all about in the 16th Century. Although it is presented in widescreen format, it is too bad that no subtitles were included. Still, this is a documentary worth owning to compliment some of the other incomplete or inaccurate documentaries available on the Ottoman Empire.",1424476800,6,2701,5.178489702517163
