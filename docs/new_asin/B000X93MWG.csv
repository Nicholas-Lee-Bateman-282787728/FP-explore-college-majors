2999384,5,B000X93MWG,"This is a wonderful film that captures the culture and personalities that engendered the sport.  It does a great job of presenting the grit and verve of the various individuals and factions that created the sport.  Even if you think you know what went into the birth of mountain biking in Marin, I guarantee you'll come away with a deeper, fresh understanding of the people and technologies that gave birth the sport.",1209340800,2,417,4.777777777777778
2999385,5,B000X93MWG,"This is really a doumentary of Mountain Bikes. Where they started and how and by who they were developed.
It is very well done and I am sure you would enjoy it.",1208217600,,160,4.03125
2999386,5,B000X93MWG,"KLUNKERZ is like a riding down a mountain itself... it's thrilling, it teaches you a few lessons and it's a breath of fresh air. If you've ever wanted to know how mountain biking got its humble beginnings, then this is a film that you must see. Many people think that it began with a group of wayward, weed-smoking hippies in Marin, but this is not entirely the case. Guys like Gary Fisher and Tom Ritchey were dedicated athletes who had the vision and the adventurous spirit to create bikes that could handle off-road terrain and they created their bikes with style. The film has a lovely pastiche of characters, who in their own words, describe the genesis behind what is now a multi-billion dollar industry. With archival footage from the early days up at Mount Tam to the fascinating recollections of some of these early bicycle pioneers, KLUNKERZ is a must have for anyone's library.",1197590400,9,888,4.735483870967742
2999387,2,B000X93MWG,I was hoping klunkerz would be for mt biking what dogtown and the z boys was to skateboarding. Reflective on the california history of the sport with something for folks that were elsewhere doing the same or even not involved in the sport.  Unfortunately Klunkerz came out more like a home movie for Gary Fisher and friends.  I enjoyed the riding scenes and some of the interviews but ultimately was left wanting to know more on the secondary players and a little drama to keep it lively. For a movie from an area known for its music I was suprised it didn't have a stronger soundtrack.,1197417600,3,586,4.518867924528302
2999388,4,B000X93MWG,"Klunkerz is a wonderfully entertaining look at the birth of not only the mountain bike but the mountain biker as well.  Rather than rely upon rumors and hear-say, Billy Savage goes directly to the sources to get the story straight from those who were there.

Not only is the material informative, it is presented in clean order with narration that really keeps the viewer feeling connected.  Savage isn't only a professional, he is also clearly passionate about his sport.

Mountain Bike Tales has a wonderful review of this film on their site:

I guess that I am late to riding mountain bikes...as I bought my first one in 1988 in Utah...once I moved to Marin, everyone told me that mountain biking started out here...watching this movie really helped me understand the history better.

A great film for embracing the contributions and beginnings of what many see as corporate company names now. Really brings these names back to faces, personas and passions that began this great sport.

2999409,5,B000X93MWG,"I grew up riding and working on a bicycle in the 70's.  I delivered newpapers as a 12 year old kid in Colorado Springs on an big single speed fat tire cruiser bicycle modified with front and rear racks.  Man I wish I still had that bike.  When my family moved to Louisville Kentucky in the 80's, I continued to use that old Klunker for my paper route.  It was so reliable for many years. I used it to go everywhere I wanted.  In the early 90's, I found myself in the high desert of Southern California, courtesy of Uncle Sam.  One day I bought a Ironhorse mountain bike on a whim for $500, which was a large part of my paycheck.  For the next 10 years I used that bike to commute, ride the trails in Big Bear, CA, then when I moved to San Clemente, CA ride the diverse singletrack that was available in Orange County in the 90's.  Circumstances made my commute about 50 miles so I got into motorcycling. I have spent the last 20 years motorcycling on and off road.  I just recently have decided to stop riding motorcycles offroad and get back into mountainbiking.  I now live only 9 miles away from work and I commute offroad because the roads out in the desert suck for roadies (high speeds, narrow, soft sand shoulders).  I remembered why I have always loved bicycles and exploring offroad on them.  This film brings back a lot of memories, I loved it.  But I am kind of biased because I love bicycles.",1424390400,,1404,4.2927756653992395
2999410,5,B000X93MWG,"Awesome to see the roots and beginning of what has been my passion since 1987.

I have seen the bicycles evolve radically since my first steel Zebra ""mountain bike"" in 1987, and this documentary, is very inspiring and makes me want to ride more.",1423872000,,245,4.568181818181818

2999417,2,B000X93MWG,"Really a drag. I guess if you enjoy a bunch of NoCal honks explaining over and over and over how cool they were you may find some enjoyment. The overwhelming ego of most of these guys was difficult to bear.

Too bad such a great sport got such and ego stroking treatment instead of a fun history/documentary. Could have/should have been a Z-Boys calibre. Oddly Z-Boys had the same ego fueled characters but had much more soul.

Some cool vintage film is its only  redeeming quality.

If you're a bike junkie like me, you'll love it. But even if you're not you'll enjoy it - my girlfriend watched it with me and she doesn't ride at all. It's entertaining and it's a fascinating glance back into history.",1405036800,,364,4.140845070422535

2999421,5,B000X93MWG,"Very good compilation of interviews and seemingly rare video shorts. Good for a wide range of audiences, not just the avid mountain biking history enthusiast. This is a human interest story and it was created in a perspective that makes you feel like you're meeting the key players in person. I don't like spoilers, so rather than doing that, I'll continue by telling you what this is not. This is not a boring educational film or a thorough encylopedic documentary that explains the evolution of suspensions or safety gear.",1389830400,3,524,4.898876404494382
2999422,4,B000X93MWG,I thought it was very interesting to see the beginnings of mountain biking and some of the pioneers of the sport. Thought it would be a little more in depth but still very well done. A must see for every mtb enthusiast!,1389484800,,219,4.238095238095238
2999423,3,B000X93MWG,"It was good, not the best documentary, could have been done a little better. It was kind of repetitive, lacking additional detail and content.",1387584000,,142,4.958333333333333
2999424,5,B000X93MWG,"If you like mountain biking, this historical look at its humble beginning will really entertain you. Welded motorcycle parts? No brakes? One of my favorite scenes is when they discuss how little they spent on creating these Klunkerz ... mostly from salvaged parts...yet they all chipped in to buy a precise timepiece. They had to know who IS the fastest downhill. Now THAT is important. Brakes? Well, those will be added later.  This is an epic story you can watch over and over again, especially the night before your next ride....",1385856000,2,532,4.846153846153846

2999427,4,B000X93MWG,"An amazing series of old 8mm footage of a bunch of crazy bicyclists bombing down fire roads on heavily modified paper boys bikes from the 40s and 50s, mixed with some fantastic interviews with the folks who took it to the next level: commercial production of some of the best mountain bikes available. Make it a party...grill some food and drink some brews with your good friends while you watch this.

Two problems with this piece: the editing is a little ""klunky"" and it's too short!",1367712000,,485,4.6395348837209305

2999430,5,B000X93MWG,"Don't have much to add as the other reviewers provide a good synopsis...just wanted my kudos on the record as I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of archival 8 mm footage included. Remember, technology was WAY different back then: in the beginning, only coaster brakes + an extended foot if you needed to stop barreling down the mountain. Concentrates on the Mt. Tam scene, but includes segments on mountain bike pioneers in the south SF Bay (Cupertino Bike Shop) and Colorado (Crestview). Great bonus tracks.",1309132800,,507,4.976470588235294
2999431,5,B000X93MWG,"I thought I was in the vanguard of mountain biking when I started riding in the late `80s, never thinking of when and where it all started -- just assuming it evolved from BMX.  Goes to show how wrong you can be when you just assume something.  After reading some mtb magazines I started to get the idea that there was much more to it than simply some bicycle manufacturer deciding to put gears on a big BMX bike.  ""Klunkerz"" tells the fascinating story of the beginning, and how a small bunch of fun seekers started a sport that lets grown men continue to have the taste of freedom and adventure that the bicycle brought them in their childhood.",1300320000,,646,4.411764705882353

If you're buying this film, buy directly from Pumelo Pictures.  You'll be directly supporting the film maker (you might even get a personal note from him) and it'll probably be cheaper!",1294272000,,437,4.636363636363637

I still ride my Fisher Montare hardtail mountain bike, the most elegant of its time. Billy Savage combines action clips and narratives very well to tell the story of the birth of the mountain bike. The extra features on the DVD telling the stories of the people and the video are very good. I'ts good to see that most of us 'klunkerz' are still around riding our bikes. Highly recommended! Also: 'Breaking Away', 'Quick Silver', the audio CD from Kraftwerk 'Tour de France' and Frank Berto's book 'The Birth of Dirt'.",1273449600,,611,4.614678899082569

2999435,5,B000X93MWG,This movie is a comprehensive look at the history and evolution of the mountain bike.  It's like someone has taken every obscure article I've ever read about the mountain bike history and made it into an entertaining documentary.  I can't believe thy found the Marrow Dirt Club too!  This is a must see for all - even my wife liked it!,1269216000,,335,4.459016393442623
2999436,5,B000X93MWG,"Having been a long-time Mountain biker, and having grown up in Marin County in the 1970's, I had to see Klunkerz. Although I'm younger than the Fairfax gang, Ritchie, Fisher, etc., I remember seeing some of Joe Breeze's early bikes around Mill Valley while in High School.
Billy Savage has chronicled the early days quite well; it goes along with what I knew from being on the periphery. The footage from the original Repack races is amazing, and it's refreshing hearing the Marin guys giving much credit to the South Bay guys for some innovations. If you've ever wondered where it all started, or even why they're called ""Mountain"" bikes, then you need to see Klunkerz.",1265328000,,670,4.7844827586206895

We have even seen the extra footage several times. The next day after watching the film I took my mountain bike on a long ride. My friend and I also ride our balloon tired beach cruisers in the dirt now, we have been so inspired by the film.

2999440,5,B000X93MWG,An entertaining and enlightening film about the development of mountain biking. Great intercutting between old footage and interviews.

If you liked the dog town documentery than this movie is def for you.  Not much bonus stuff, but the movie itself is very good with plenty of old 70s footage, wish there was a movie like this on the history of road bikes also.  Any person interested in Bicycles of any kind should watch this they'll love it.  And the seller sent it Super fast.",1255046400,,543,4.1923076923076925
2999442,5,B000X93MWG,"This film is very important (and funny) and will always be relevant to people who are both mountain bikers and road bikers.

It's important that the origin's of the sport were chonicled and as time goes on, the images of these pioneers will become even more endeering  to enthusiasts as; like Kitty-Hawk to aviators. This production permanntly archives the  rapidly deteerorting super 8 film that was sitting in a box in some forgotten storage unit.
Billions of people bike and hundres of million of people use mountain bikes and at some point everyone asks - ""when did people start biking over steep hills?"" and ""did road biking come first or the mountain bike come first?"" Now we have the answers to these questions.

On that note, the film's producer did a magnificent job capturing not only the rare footage, but the humor and the atmosphere of the 70's. What's not to like?

Bravo!",1253664000,,886,4.764705882352941
2999443,5,B000X93MWG,I'm no film critic but I thought Klunkerz was particularly cool - Billy Savage did mountain biking justice with his cast from the past and present.  Billy did a really nice job of showing and giving meaning to history/chronology with facts and personal stories as well as fun special effects - just the right amount!  It was very interesting to see video footage from the 70's - impressive that they had gone to the effort of documenting their early shenanigans.  I have been a mountain biker for 18 years and live and ride at the heart of the very trails shown in the film.  My husband doesn't even own a bike.  We watched Klunkerz together and were equally entertained/educated/impressed by the content and the craftsmanship of this movie.  Klunkerz stands out as a quality homage to the sport and origins of mountain biking.,1252281600,,827,4.748251748251748

2999445,5,B000X93MWG,"Hats off to Billy Savage. The way he put this documentary together required ingenuity, lots of hard work, a good many deals, extensive searching, some travel, and probably a few feet of duct tape. As we watch the movie, we become aware this is very similar to the approach of the mountain bike pioneers. Because of the unslick, unpolished--yet very professional--style of this documentary we are somehow brought to how it must have been at the time. I cannot think of a better way to have presented the information.

I was a journalist in England observing the mountain biking boom in the 1980s, and later made my career in the sport. Although I've talked personally to many of the pioneers, Savage's film filled-in many gaps in my knowledge, and he answers one big question that lingered for decades (watch the film to see what it is).

This has to be regarded as the authoritative history of the origins of the mountain bike. Billy Savage interviews all the key players and builds a consensus through discourses that are both entertaining and very candid.

Nostalgia is abundant in the film, but not by design, and it's not a rose-tinted look at those years. Klunkerz manages to capture some of the zeitgeist that spawned the the excitement and determination of this group of unlikely world-changers.

I've spoken to several of the people interviewed in the film about its authenticity. They agree that it's a very accurate and comprehensive portrayal of events surrounding the creation of the mountain bike. Who could ask for a stronger recommendation that that? So watch, listen, learn and be entertained. This is essential viewing for anybody with an interest in mountain bikes or cycling culture.",1249603200,6,1702,4.940559440559441

It's a mix of interviews from today's time, a good amount of actual footage from the seventies and some narrative that connects everything together.  It was actually inspirational to see how a bunch of guys who all had their different reasons for wanting to improve the bikes collaborated and competed at the same time.

The guys (and girl!) had no idea that they were laying the foundation for the massive industry that mountain biking is today -- and they didn't care.  Great stuff.  Thumbs up!!",1236384000,,526,4.8
2999452,5,B000X93MWG,"Friday, January 30, 2009 we attended the Competitor Magazine Film Festival in Encinitas, CA. It was an all-day sensory treat and loads of fun.

One film that really stood out is ""Klunkerz,"" which documents the origins of the mountain bike and the sport of mountain biking. The story of a how a bunch of colorful characters reinvented the sport of cycling is truly riveting and extremely entertaining. The filmmaker, Billie Savage, completely immersed himself in this project and went to great lengths to secure original photos and film from the 70s and to track down and interview everyone who was part of the scene. There are also some wonderful reenactments, plus a fun use of comic strips, cartoons, and other interesting visual effects which help to bring the whole story to life. Trust me, there are multiple nuances to ""the invention story"" which will come as surprise and revelation to even the most veteran cyclists and historians of the sport.

What stands out most, though, are the people themselves, some of whom became famous and household names, and others - equally important - who had otherwise been resigned to the dustbin of history. Until now.

What's so impressive and engaging about every one of these people is that they are just as colorful, just as animated, and just as excited now as they were 35 years ago. Their very spirit is refreshing and contagious. Kudos to Savage for the untold time and effort he put into this film. Thank you to all the people - from Tom Ritchey to Joe Breeze, from Charlie Kelly to Gary Fisher, from Alan Bonds to Otis Guy, from Wende Cragg to Charlie Cunningham, from the Barrow Dirt Club to Velo Club Tamalpais, and many, many more - for what they created for all of us in the 70s and for how they opened up their hearts and souls for this film!

Even if you - horrors! - don't even cycle off-road, you will enjoy this film. Please do yourself a favor and order it now!

If you've ever wanted to know how mountain biking got its humble beginnings, then this is a film that you must see. Many people think that it began with a group of wayward, weed-smoking hippies in Marin, but this is not entirely the case. Guys like Gary Fisher and Tom Ritchey were dedicated athletes who had the vision and the adventurous spirit to create bikes that could handle off-road terrain and they created their bikes with style. The film has a lovely pastiche of characters, who in their own words, describe the genesis behind what is now a multi-billion dollar industry. With archival footage from the early days up at Mount Tam to the fascinating recollections of some of these early bicycle pioneers, KLUNKERZ is a must have for anyone's library.",1197590400,9,888,4.735483870967742

Reflective on the california history of the sport with something for folks that were elsewhere doing the same or even not involved in the sport.  Unfortunately Klunkerz came out more like a home movie for Gary Fisher and friends.  I enjoyed the riding scenes and some of the interviews but ultimately was left wanting to know more on the secondary players and a little drama to keep it lively. For a movie from an area known for its music I was suprised it didn't have a stronger soundtrack.,1197417600,3,586,4.518867924528302

I delivered newpapers as a 12 year old kid in Colorado Springs on an big single speed fat tire cruiser bicycle modified with front and rear racks.  Man I wish I still had that bike.  When my family moved to Louisville Kentucky in the 80's, I continued to use that old Klunker for my paper route.  It was so reliable for many years. I used it to go everywhere I wanted.  In the early 90's, I found myself in the high desert of Southern California, courtesy of Uncle Sam.  One day I bought a Ironhorse mountain bike on a whim for $500, which was a large part of my paycheck.  For the next 10 years I used that bike to commute, ride the trails in Big Bear, CA, then when I moved to San Clemente, CA ride the diverse singletrack that was available in Orange County in the 90's.  Circumstances made my commute about 50 miles so I got into motorcycling. I have spent the last 20 years motorcycling on and off road.  I just recently have decided to stop riding motorcycles offroad and get back into mountainbiking.  I now live only 9 miles away from work and I commute offroad because the roads out in the desert suck for roadies (high speeds, narrow, soft sand shoulders).  I remembered why I have always loved bicycles and exploring offroad on them.  This film brings back a lot of memories, I loved it.

Too bad such a great sport got such and ego stroking treatment instead of a fun history/documentary. Could have/should have been a Z-Boys calibre. Oddly Z-Boys had the same ego fueled characters but had much more soul.

Billy Savage has chronicled the early days quite well; it goes along with what I knew from being on the periphery. The footage from the original Repack races is amazing, and it's refreshing hearing the Marin guys giving much credit to the South Bay guys for some innovations.

3233937,5,B000X93MWG,An entertaining and enlightening film about the development of mountain biking. Great intercutting between old footage and interviews. Interesting insights by the top guys in the field. A great history lesson on the beginnings of this young sport.,1255392000,,247,5.526315789473684

Gives you the inside look at what was going on in the Cali mountains which eventually turned into the mordern mt bike as we know it from the guys who pioneered it.  If you liked the dog town documentery than this movie is def for you.  Not much bonus stuff, but the movie itself is very good with plenty of old 70s footage, wish there was a movie like this on the history of road bikes also.  Any person interested in Bicycles of any kind should watch this they'll love it.  And the seller sent it Super fast.",1255046400,,543,4.1923076923076925
3233939,5,B000X93MWG,"This film is very important (and funny) and will always be relevant to people who are both mountain bikers and road bikers.

It's important that the origin's of the sport were chonicled and as time goes on, the images of these pioneers will become even more endeering  to enthusiasts as; like Kitty-Hawk to aviators. This production permanntly archives the  rapidly deteerorting super 8 film that was sitting in a box in some forgotten storage unit.
Billions of people bike and hundres of million of people use mountain bikes and at some point everyone asks - ""when did people start biking over steep hills?"" and ""did road biking come first or the mountain bike come first?"" Now we have the answers to these questions.

On that note, the film's producer did a magnificent job capturing not only the rare footage, but the humor and the atmosphere of the 70's. What's not to like?

Bravo!",1253664000,,886,4.764705882352941
3233940,5,B000X93MWG,I'm no film critic but I thought Klunkerz was particularly cool - Billy Savage did mountain biking justice with his cast from the past and present.  Billy did a really nice job of showing and giving meaning to history/chronology with facts and personal stories as well as fun special effects - just the right amount!  It was very interesting to see video footage from the 70's - impressive that they had gone to the effort of documenting their early shenanigans.  I have been a mountain biker for 18 years and live and ride at the heart of the very trails shown in the film.  My husband doesn't even own a bike.  We watched Klunkerz together and were equally entertained/educated/impressed by the content and the craftsmanship of this movie.  Klunkerz stands out as a quality homage to the sport and origins of mountain biking.,1252281600,,827,4.748251748251748
3233941,5,B000X93MWG,"Great film.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves bikes, lives mountain biking, loves sports history or just loves quality documentaries.  Sorry this is so short, but I'm inspired to go out and get on my bike - nice work Billy!",1251590400,,233,4.523809523809524
3233942,5,B000X93MWG,"Hats off to Billy Savage. The way he put this documentary together required ingenuity, lots of hard work, a good many deals, extensive searching, some travel, and probably a few feet of duct tape. As we watch the movie, we become aware this is very similar to the approach of the mountain bike pioneers. Because of the unslick, unpolished--yet very professional--style of this documentary we are somehow brought to how it must have been at the time. I cannot think of a better way to have presented the information.

I was a journalist in England observing the mountain biking boom in the 1980s, and later made my career in the sport. Although I've talked personally to many of the pioneers, Savage's film filled-in many gaps in my knowledge, and he answers one big question that lingered for decades (watch the film to see what it is).

This has to be regarded as the authoritative history of the origins of the mountain bike. Billy Savage interviews all the key players and builds a consensus through discourses that are both entertaining and very candid.

Nostalgia is abundant in the film, but not by design, and it's not a rose-tinted look at those years. Klunkerz manages to capture some of the zeitgeist that spawned the the excitement and determination of this group of unlikely world-changers.

I've spoken to several of the people interviewed in the film about its authenticity. They agree that it's a very accurate and comprehensive portrayal of events surrounding the creation of the mountain bike. Who could ask for a stronger recommendation that that? So watch, listen, learn and be entertained. This is essential viewing for anybody with an interest in mountain bikes or cycling culture.",1249603200,6,1702,4.940559440559441

3233948,5,B000X93MWG,"I loved watching the movie.  It's a mix of interviews from today's time, a good amount of actual footage from the seventies and some narrative that connects everything together.  It was actually inspirational to see how a bunch of guys who all had their different reasons for wanting to improve the bikes collaborated and competed at the same time.

The guys (and girl!) had no idea that they were laying the foundation for the massive industry that mountain biking is today -- and they didn't care.  Great stuff.  Thumbs up!!",1236384000,,526,4.8
3233949,5,B000X93MWG,"Friday, January 30, 2009 we attended the Competitor Magazine Film Festival in Encinitas, CA. It was an all-day sensory treat and loads of fun.

One film that really stood out is ""Klunkerz,"" which documents the origins of the mountain bike and the sport of mountain biking. The story of a how a bunch of colorful characters reinvented the sport of cycling is truly riveting and extremely entertaining. The filmmaker, Billie Savage, completely immersed himself in this project and went to great lengths to secure original photos and film from the 70s and to track down and interview everyone who was part of the scene. There are also some wonderful reenactments, plus a fun use of comic strips, cartoons, and other interesting visual effects which help to bring the whole story to life. Trust me, there are multiple nuances to ""the invention story"" which will come as surprise and revelation to even the most veteran cyclists and historians of the sport.

What stands out most, though, are the people themselves, some of whom became famous and household names, and others - equally important - who had otherwise been resigned to the dustbin of history. Until now.

What's so impressive and engaging about every one of these people is that they are just as colorful, just as animated, and just as excited now as they were 35 years ago. Their very spirit is refreshing and contagious. Kudos to Savage for the untold time and effort he put into this film. Thank you to all the people - from Tom Ritchey to Joe Breeze, from Charlie Kelly to Gary Fisher, from Alan Bonds to Otis Guy, from Wende Cragg to Charlie Cunningham, from the Barrow Dirt Club to Velo Club Tamalpais, and many, many more - for what they created for all of us in the 70s and for how they opened up their hearts and souls for this film!

Even if you - horrors! - don't even cycle off-road, you will enjoy this film. Please do yourself a favor and order it now!

The narrative, footage and interviews weave together into a fantastic story and I was glued from start to finish.  The bonus material is great too.
