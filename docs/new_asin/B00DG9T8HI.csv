5796043,5,B00DG9T8HI,This dvd is superb and my 3 year old and 5 year old are really learning speaking Spanish so fast. It is amazing how fun they made it to learn Spanish.,1414022400,2,150,3.870967741935484
5796044,5,B00DG9T8HI,"My daughter was enrolled in a Spanish school (half day on Saturdays) in our area, and she was learning to speak Spanish, but progress was slow.  We looked into another option for her, and came across this video (comes with a workbook that highlights and reinforces the video content).  Our daughter enjoyed them so much that I (finally) heard her speaking Spanish spontaneously at home (and it was great for me to watch also!).  She learned more from this video than she had in nearly a year of Spanish school, and she had a lot more fun doing it!  After the money we invested in Spanish school, I see this video and workbook as a very good ""bang for my buck"".  Our daughter learned a new language, and had a really good time doing it.  The video is developmentally sensitive for her age group (she was 8 when she watched the video and did the workbook), and it adds a cultural section that I really like, because our daughter could see more of the larger context for learning another language.  We were looking for something that would get her excited about learning Spanish, and we found it here.  Definitely worth checking out!  We can't wait for more volumes to come!",1412985600,3,1171,4.538095238095238
5796045,4,B00DG9T8HI,"Fun and entertaining way to train the ear for Spanish, while increasing vocabulary. I wish there were more skits on the video for the price and more thorough workbooks to teach the material presented, but good supplement or springboard.",1412294400,,236,5.076923076923077
5796046,5,B00DG9T8HI,A fun and interactive way to learn Spanish. I always had trouble remembering Spanish when I learned it and watching the fun and engaging stories were much easier ways to learn and most important remembering it. 5 stars!!!,1410480000,2,221,4.842105263157895
5796047,5,B00DG9T8HI,"If you want your child to learn Spanish, I highly recommend this DVD.  I bought it for my daughter for Christmas to help her before she takes her first class.  I was amazed at how much she learned and remembered.  Its very clever and funny which makes learning easy.  In the video, the words you learned are showed in writing and pronounced verbally. The scenes in which these words are introduced are really easy to understand and fun to watch.  Awesome DVD.  I will definitely buy the next level.

5796048,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I have spent a lot of time teaching kids Spanish and this is a fabulous tool. The secret is that children learn without realizing they are learning. It is sort of like extending the magic years of infancy when little ones learn by osmosis.  The scenes capture the attention, and the brain learns almost on automatic pilot. I am so old that I am familiar with most of the old dialogue teaching systems. This is a great system.",1387065600,18,425,4.448717948717949
5796049,5,B00DG9T8HI,I speak Spanish fluently and I think these are great videos. I appreciate that it's not about learning isolated words but more conversational Spanish.  My  kids enjoyed them.,1480636800,,174,5.178571428571429
5796050,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I am very impressed with this program thus far.  After searching for ways to make Spanish language learning accessible for my children, I saw this on Amazon and then made my way to the website, foreignlanguagesforkids.com, to learn more.  I ended up deciding to sign up for a month online to determine if I liked the program.  The online membership includes the videos, workbooks, quizzes, and games, all accessed online.  Our month is almost up, and I just signed up for a year.  The videos are exceptionally strong at teaching Spanish in a way that is engaging for my children, age 7 and 9. They have started confidently speaking Spanish around the house, and their interest in learning more continues.  Since my children are young, they are able to learn Spanish and sound like a native-speaker in terms of their pronunciation, and it is exciting to see how much they enjoy the process.  I have done graduate work in language learning, and this series does a fantastic job of tying in visuals and repetition while using high-interest, relatable situations for kids.  Since it is engaging and scaffolds learning from simpler to more complex language tasks, it has worked well.  Also, since the situations in the videos are relatable, the vocabulary is easy to incorporate into our daily routine, so it gets used and thus reinforced.  The videos are only in Spanish, so it is helpful that I have some knowledge of Spanish to explain to my children anything they don't understand, but everything is labeled and acted out so well that even new words for me typically become apparent from the videos.  My kids also enjoy the workbooks and the games that are found on the website which are part of the online membership.  Additionally, there are geography and culture lessons about Spanish-speaking countries.  Finally, Kit, the designer of the program, has been extremely responsive via email with any questions that I have.  It is clear that she is passionate about giving children the opportunity to learn a new language.  Overall, I am looking forward to seeing how much my children's Spanish skills grow in the next year and am grateful to have found this program.",1477440000,,2166,4.879781420765028
5796051,5,B00DG9T8HI,We are loving this video! My 7 & 9 year old are already speaking Spanish after reviewing the first lesson twice. Very pleased,1477094400,2,125,4.478260869565218
5796052,5,B00DG9T8HI,This is an AWESOME video.  Children learn in context.  It's funny and clear.  I explained that practice makes perfect and that we would be watching it often to improve our skills.  I also explained the flashbacks to clarify a certain phrase.  We approach it like a game.  It has been very effective.  I bought the other volumes as well expecting the same great results.  Thank you for a great product!,1476921600,8,401,4.628571428571429
5796053,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I greatly enjoyed this video and what's more so did my 7 year old son. They are ""teaching"" him Spanish in school but I could see that their efforts are lacking so I am supplementing at home. After researching I decided to purchase the video and as I speak some Spanish it is helpful for me as well. He liked the video so much that I ordered the other two.",1476748800,3,355,4.085714285714285

5796056,5,B00DG9T8HI,My wife and I were amazed with how quickly our children started picking up Spanish with these videos. They laugh and speak Spanish around the house trying to sound like the children in the videos. Our children actually ASK to watch these over and over. Our older child (9th grade) wasn't interested in doing these but was drawn in when we were watching and now reluctantly admits he is learning and it is even helping him with his high school Spanish class. My wife recently ordered the books and card game that go with the DVD and our children are excited about trying them. The difference with this DVD from others we have tried is that the words stick with you. There is something about the stories that is very catchy and appealing.,1475366400,4,736,4.541353383458647
5796057,5,B00DG9T8HI,The only way to keep my kids interested in learning a foreign language! Even my toddler was running around the house saying Spanish phrases!! Will definitely try the next one!,1474243200,4,175,4.866666666666666
5796058,4,B00DG9T8HI,"This is a good video to continue to teach my kids Spanish. My parents are Colombian so I grew speaking Spanish and wanted to pass on the language to my kids. I noticed they would understand it but not want to speak it. This video has helped them feel more confident to speak Spanish. I plan on buying the next 2 videos that follow this one. By the way my kids's ages are 11, 9, 4, & 1. My oldest thought the video was stupid at first but he is learning a lot. They all find it entertaining, which helps them absorb more. Now I have high hopes my kids will be speaking Spanish fluently!",1474070400,9,585,4.095652173913043
5796059,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I wanted to teach my kids Spanish in a fun, engaging way over the summer.  We ended up signing up for the monthly membership online, but I imagine that the video content is the same on the DVDs.  My 9 year old and 5 year old both loved the videos, looked forward to watching them (with no complaining) and quickly began speaking Spanish phrases.",1471305600,,345,4.375

5796062,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I had a membership on their website and did a lesson every morning.  My son enjoyed all their videos and learned very quickly.  I recommend all their videos, they learn from kids.  My son looked forward to the next lesson.",1469491200,,222,4.5
5796063,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I LOVE IT.
I have been looking for something like this for a long time.
I love that the idea ""kids teaching kids through a story""
For my experience teaching Spanish I know how important is to have fun in class.
I also love the story and every lesson is the continuation of the previous lesson.
I recommend it.",1468368000,,309,4.254237288135593
5796064,2,B00DG9T8HI,"The kids loved it. But, for $25, it has only 3 chapters - around 90 mins of content total. This is hardly enough to learn Spanish or any language. There are probably around 50 words that are covered in total. The DVD itself is fun to watch and the child actors are very good. But in my opinion, it not effective as a learning tool at all.

Update: After I returned the disc, I received a polite email from ""K. Strauss, Founder"" asking for feedback. It was an auto generated email but there was no link or contact information to provide feedback.",1468022400,,545,4.3431372549019605
5796065,4,B00DG9T8HI,"So far my kids love it. Not 5 stars yet because we just got started. So far they have learned a lot, but I can see them getting bored with it. I combine the video with songs, and games.",1467158400,,185,3.769230769230769

5796068,5,B00DG9T8HI,"As an elementary level Spanish teacher, I can think of no finer tool for introducing foreign language than Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids.  The program is immersive, strategic and lots of fun.  My students were engaged, excited and using the language outside of class with family and friends. That's because FLK delivers a coherent and authentic experience with characters the kids love and relevant situations that make therm laugh and learn simultaneously.  The colorful, engaging workbooks are invaluable, whether online or paper versions, for reinforcing vocabulary and grammar.  The other day a teacher told me that her students were disappointed that Spanish had been cancelled because of changes in our schedule that day.  The teacher told them that if they had Spanish they would miss recess.  Their response:  ""We'd rather have Spanish than recess!!!""  Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids is a leap forward in foreign language acquisition for kids--and  for their parents, too!

If you go foreign language for kids by kids website, there are links to watch sample videos. This was how I decided to purchase this one. We are learning the Spaish words presented in this video and I hear my kids use the words while they play.",1463097600,11,363,4.432835820895522
5796071,4,B00DG9T8HI,"This review will cover both volume 1 and volume 2 as I have purchased both for my kids. Overall, the DVDs are excellent. Most importantly, my kids like them (they are 8-year-old twins). We had only done books before this and they certainly like the videos much more. The videos teach some very practical words and expressions. The upsides definitely outweigh the downsides, but the downsides are still significant. The first is the cost/minute. Each DVD is $25 and they are only about 40 minutes. I have spent $50 so far, and the kids have learned a lot of words, but I'm not sure if it has been completely worth it. If the DVDs were longer, then I would not even mention it. The next is that the videos are total immersion, meaning there are not any English explanations for what the words mean. You have to look at their actions and understand what they are doing in order to understand what the Spanish word or expression is describing. For the most part, my kids did fine with this but there were many times that I had to explain what they're asking. I have been studying Spanish for the last year and a half, so I am ahead of my children but there were still a couple times it took me some time to figure out what the expression meant. An example is one of the boys has water and asks his brother and a friend ""tiene sed"". If you don't know this Spanish expression, you have to figure out that he is asking them if they are thirsty. Overall, I recommend these DVDs. I just wish they were longer and they gave the English translation",1462924800,56,1537,4.3776223776223775
5796072,5,B00DG9T8HI,"Learning by doing is the way I can summarize the first volume of Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids (FL4K). FL4K teaches Spanish in a very practical conversational and contextual stylewith straightforward scenarios and examples when various words will be used. FL4K doesnt bog down the viewer with a deluge of verb and form memorizations that most are accustomed to learning in a Spanish class. The actors/actresses are children/teens each with their own personalities and goals. The three brothers and stars of the showEli, Andy, and Parker make the learning fun with their idiosyncrasies.

Comparisons like big versus little are illustrated through the use of a big dog Grande and a little dog Pequena and other visual cues.  And the whole video is packaged as an in-flight movie on an airline, giving the viewer an experience of being on vacation and watching the movie to pass the time on the way to their destination.",1462752000,,922,4.98051948051948
5796073,2,B00DG9T8HI,"As a native Spanish speaker I was not impressed by this video. The video has music that sounds like circus music and there is not much substance to this video. The video is also short at roughly 1/2 hour and is split in 3 sections, so each section does not cover much. There is  A LOT of repetitive phrases and a few of the kids in the video sound like they have American accents which does not help much when trying to understand the correct pronunciation. I am only giving this video 2 stars because my kids seem to like it but it has not helped to enhance their conversational Spanish.",1461456000,5,588,4.297297297297297

5796079,5,B00DG9T8HI,"As a homeschooling Mom teaching Kindergarten this year, I really enjoyed learning Spanish with my daughter using Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids. The high quality videos showing kids speaking Spanish in natural situations were fun to watch. We wanted to watch them again and again and my five year old learned enough Spanish to use it at breakfast the next day! The workbook pages and games reinforce new vocabulary and enhance the program by incorporating reading and spelling. I would use this curriculum for kids 5 and up as a no fuss way to introduce the Spanish language to kids. I received a free trial of the program in exchange for my honest review, I was not required to write a positive review and all thoughts and opinions are my own.",1448236800,2,748,4.674242424242424

5796081,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I bought this DVD to use for my Spanish class. I was really pleased to see how my students enjoy this video and how this video holds their attention every time I play it. After using this video I asked my students what Spanish words they had learned and I was very surprised to see they have learned or reinforced a very good number of words.  I am definitely happy to have found a video that teaches Spanish in a fun and dynamic way. My students are learning and having fun with this video and without noticing they are learning more as they continue watching it. As a Spanish teacher I fully recommend this video.

5796083,5,B00DG9T8HI,"This video series is by far the best program out there for older children! My seven year old daughter started 2nd grade at a Spanish language immersion school this year, and we really wanted to find an at home program to supplement her learning experience that was engaging as well as educational.  All of the other programs we looked at were geared towards babies and toddlers, and frankly bored her.  When we found this series, I was afraid that once again she would turn her nose up at the videos. But to my delight, she actually enjoyed watching the videos... and wanted to watch more... and I enjoy watching and learning with her!
I highly recommend these videos to any parent who has a child in a language immersion school (or anyone wanting their child to learn Spanish), as this series reinforces the same ideas of  learning a language through exposure and conversation in kid friendly, humor infused skits.",1443398400,3,915,4.7421383647798745
5796084,3,B00DG9T8HI,"The DVD seems more advanced than beginner. A little fast and difficult to follow at times. There should be more English definitions of what each word or phrase means, and maybe more pauses to give the viewer time with pronunciation.",1441065600,,232,4.825

I couldn't find any that was interesting to my children.  Then I came across with this dvd and it was amazing!  Not only my younger children but also two older ones liked to watch it with their siblings and enjoy it a lot.  My three younger children who never learned Spanish before, began to say things in Spanish very next day!  The stories are very engaging and funny which draw children's attention like magnet.
It is also good review for my older children who already started learning Spanish at school.  I highly recommend this dvd.  It is very effective way to learn Spanish.",1434585600,4,754,4.413043478260869

The company was generous and wonderful to work with.  Thank you.",1429056000,7,347,4.733333333333333
5796089,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I am currently enrolled in the online video subscription at www.foreignlanguagesforkids.com. It includes all the videos at a monthly or yearly rate.

I have been using it with my 5 kids for over a month and the results are blowing me away! My children are young, 3, 5, 6, and 7. We watch it about 3 times a week during breakfast. They have memorized all the words and vocabulary in this first video. They understand the meaning of the words, use proper pronunciation, etc. The sessions are funny and engaging, my kids love watching other kids just living life and relating to the characters. I love that it is immersion with no one telling you what the words mean. instead they show you through clips, acting out, demonstrations, etc. After a few times of watching it you will have a clear understanding of what is being said.

When someone tells you something, a fact or reading a lesson, it is easy to disengage, let the words kind of roll over you, it often doesn't set in as true knowledge. Whereas when you are being entertained you WANT to understand! You sit a little closer to the edge of your seat, you pay close attention to what is happening in the scene. When you finally get it it stays with you and you don't forget because you worked for that knowledge and wanted it!

This is the beauty behind Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids. You remember, you learn very quickly, it sticks with you. You don't have to force your kids to do their lessons, they want to! You don't have to teach yet another program or curriculum, this one teaches itself! It takes very little time out of your day and is worth every second of it!

I highly recommend this program to any educator, parent, homeschooler, etc. If you are on the fence about the DVD head over to www.foreignlanguagesforkids.com to check out their online subscriptions. They are very reasonably priced and you get access to all the great quizzes, workbooks, and videos in the series.",1426636800,3,1946,4.583333333333333

So, is it effective?  To that, we would say YES.  The video combines fun scenarios with easy to understand words to keep kids engaged and learning at the same time.  In addition, the videos include the words on the screen at the right times to give them an additional visual clue that helps to make the word stick in your memory. We noticed a big improvement with his Spanish vocabulary along with a stronger interest in learning more Spanish.

My wife and I have tried several videos to introduce our son without much success. This DVD is different and has been successful. It is fun, clever, and really teaches Spanish the way it would be used in a family. My wife and I are enjoying the DVD too. The production values are excellent and it is incredibly clever and fun. Before long we forgot that the videos were in Spanish because they just sort of draw you in and get you feeling accustomed to hearing it. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn Spanish.",1418774400,3,742,4.537313432835821

With this new curriculum she is taking off with speaking and LOVES her classes to boot! Side note: customer service is also great!",1514851200,,270,4.76595744680851
8592909,5,B00DG9T8HI,"I have always wanted to learn a second language and now that I have two young children ages 2 years and 6 months I decided it's time that I learn and would learn along with them. I'm not sure how far we will get, but these videos have been a great start. I chose this particular set because it was recommended to me by someone who is a homeschooling mother.

Before I purchased this video, I read the reviews and some people were complaining that the entire video was in Spanish with no English subtitles. I was a little concerned because I know very little Spanish and felt discouraged immediately. Then I went to Google and did a search on how to teach your child a second language. A lot of stuff came up about parents who know two languages and want to know how to raise their kids to know/understand two languages. This was frustrating because that is not the case in our home and I was unsure if I would be able to help my kids learn Spanish if I didn't know the language myself.  Then I came across an article that said the best way to learn another language is through total immersion. Then I understood why the videos were entirely in Spanish instead of bouncing back and forth between Spanish and English.

I decided that I would take the plunge and buy the video. I have no regrets at all. The video is broken up into ""mini episodes"" and is acted out by children. The acting makes it very obvious what they are saying. The first time I watched it I was a little confused then the second, third, time etc. things were becoming much more clear to me. They also have a review at the end of each episode/lesson. I write down those words and incorporate them into our day.

My two year old laughs during the video and is learning Spanish. We are working our way slowly through the videos. Don't try and rush a child into learning everything all at once or expect them to sit down for a full 45 minutes of the video. If you force them to watch more than they can handle they will lose interest or it will become ""too hard"" for them and they'll feel like it's a punishment. Allow them to watch the video at their own pace.

Watch the video with them and incorporate what you are learning into your regular day. You will be surprised at how much you and the kids pick up.",1512000000,5,2274,4.27906976744186

The older kids liked it too, but got bored after the first two viewings. The only negative for me- I wish they covered more material.",1494460800,,262,4.36734693877551

8592916,5,B00DG9T8HI,"How something is taught is key to learning and retaining knowledge, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with learning ""disguised"" as fun!! It works. My third-grade daughter was enrolled in an after-school Spanish class a while ago, but she said it was just not interesting. Though I had her continue for a while anyway, I feared her main takeaway from that particular class might be that she did not want to learn Spanish anywhere, in any way -- so I allowed her to stop, and have been trying to find lessons for her somewhere else.  We're in Southern California, and Spanish is something I think everyone here should make it a point to learn -- it's part of our cultural fabric here, and part of the culture of America.
When I came across this company's products online, I decided to give it a try. She LOVES these, and so do I. The kids are great -- very appealing, and natural comedians -- and the set-ups are a good combination of everyday and unusual.
We love to practice the words and phrases we've learned together, and she likes to tell her friends what she's learned. I'm confident that her good feelings about learning the language will be a huge factor in her willingness to go further with Spanish once we've finished the online lessons.",1483315200,2,1251,4.609865470852018
