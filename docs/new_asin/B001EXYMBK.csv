8299924,4,B001EXYMBK,"I liked this movie, The Moss, by director Derek Kwok. It is dark, gritty and takes place in a seedy, run down area of Hong Kong.  The film stars Shawn Yue who plays the part of Jan a former undercover cop who although he remains a cop he still has ties to various mobsters and he is also in love with a prostitute named Lulu. He helps Lulu escape a bust by the police at the brothel in which she works. After Lulu's remaining family dies Lulu's little sister arrives at the brothel from mainland China to also work there.  She is played by a beautiful, little girl Shi Xueyi and her name in the movie is Fa and she appears to be about 11 years old.  It's very hard to think of this lovely, little, innocent child having to work in a brothel but you know this is one of life's very sad realities in many places. A homeless, off kilter beggar kidnaps the little girl Fa and puts Lulu in the hospital.  Jan is determined to rescue young Fa. Meanwhile a female mobster's son has gone missing and she wants Jan to track him down, find him and return him home.  Add to this mix, a brewing mob war and some very threatening Pakistanis and you have an interesting tale.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot of this crime movie plus quite a bit of violence dolled out. It is a very suspenseful and edgy movie. It is also a somewhat claustrophobic movie due to the close camera angles and shaky camera work. I give it a strong 4 stars and recommend it although I imagine it won't be to everyone's taste in Asian movies. The movie is called The Moss because moss is a lowly unnoticed plant and that lowliness is a metaphor for the lives of the people in this movie. I think it is priced too high and I found it elsewhere for less than half the stated price.",1341014400,,1758,4.171091445427729
