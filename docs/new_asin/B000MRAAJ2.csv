2740822,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I really liked this documentary though it does have its flaws. Still, I recommend it to all Moody fans. I could have done w/o a lot of the interviews of people outside the Moodies. As other reviewers have stated, there wasn't enough of Ray, but I had heard he chose not to take part. As for some of the other participants: some of them I didn't even know and had to research to find out. But I thought the interviews with the Moodies was very fascinating stuff. Also, there wasn't nearly enough old footage from the 60's and 70's, but what there is of it is priceless! I loved the parts where they first toured America on their own w/o a crew- so very special.

Yes, this  DVD needed more clips/songs of vintage Moodies and less interviews with all those ""other"" people. But I must say this is a gem for someone like me who didn't know about the Moody Blues ""back in the day."" I urge all fans to get it and enjoy!",1181433600,2,913,4.241379310344827
2740823,4,B000MRAAJ2,"The Moodies truly are classic artists.  The documentary feature of this DVD package is the best I've seen (or even read in books) on the individuals and the band.  There is a lot of Michael Pinder as there should be, but less of Ray Thomas than I had hoped.  The extra CD is OK keeping in mind that the recordings are quite dated.  Some of the quality seems to reflect their mastering from aged acetates or maybe even old records.",1179792000,2,430,4.3375
2740824,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I have to laugh at the people whining about either how this DVD is too long or that they don't like how their favorite Moody came off in the interviews. All I can say is be quiet so the rest of us can enjoy this amazing DVD!

When I first heard this was being put together I was a little skeptical. The Moodies have never been known for their fondness of interviews so there's your answer on why archival material is so scant. I was imagining that this was going to be nothing more than a narrator reiterating an uninformative overview of their careers. The new interviews, archive performance material and the incredible audio CD make this worth three times the price.

I would say that if you are looking for more of a general, quick overview of the Moody Blues, then the Legend Of A Band DVD is for you. If you are a serious fan who is looking for a truly in-depth view as told by the Moodies themselves, this is the one for you.

One final thought: it would have been wonderful to see full video clips of the incredible, pristine 60's footage that is only featured in brief clips on this collection. But to see them performing Om, Legend Of A Mind and Never Comes the Day in the original promo films (even if briefly) is truly amazing!",1178841600,6,1239,4.331896551724138
2740825,4,B000MRAAJ2,"So finally they decide to bestow on the U.S. of A. this DVD documentary of the Moody Blues. This is the ""Anthology"" of the Moodies from their humble beginnings in Birmingham to the present day featuring interviews from the band (excluding Clint Warwick because he's dead, and Patrick Moraz). Sadly Ray Thomas declined to be interviewed but some questions are answered from previous footage. There are 3 discs in the set. The first has the documentary, which is very in depth with plenty of footage and some surprises. The second disc contains more interviews and impromptu performances from Hayward plus videos of 5 songs. And the third disc is a CD of tracks from members of the Moody Blues before they became the Moody Blues. All in all a great package at a great price.",1178668800,4,772,4.725925925925926
2740826,2,B000MRAAJ2,"I'm with Kenneth Anselmi. My excitement upon receiving this DVD series was met with disappointment as I popped in disc 2. The audio CD was a disappointment as well. Rent it, borrow it, but don't buy it. Not enough thorough interviews with John and Justin. Mike Pinder came off as conceited and pompous. Too much of Denny Laine. No up to date information or interview with Ray Thomas was a huge disappointment too. I can't wait to go the concert in July so see the real thing!",1177977600,9,475,4.471264367816092
2740827,1,B000MRAAJ2,"This video consists mostly of contemporary interviews of band members and friends. There is not one complete preformance on the dvd. There is hardly any archive footage. They fly through the classic 7 period of 1967 to 1972 with barely a mention of each album. Besides ""Days of Future Past"" they hardly talk about the music and songs from the other 6 albums. The bonus dvd features 6 complete videos. Not one of them is from 1967 to 1972. This documentary seems like it was put together without trying to get rights to archive footage. A few seconds of the 1970 ""Isle of Wight"" preformance here. 20 seconds of a promo film of ""Legend of a Mind"" there. Weren't these guys ever interviewed in the '60's and early '70's? If they were no footage is shown. How can you have a 153 minute film with NO complete preformances? Save your money and rent this.",1177891200,44,848,4.512987012987013
2740828,4,B000MRAAJ2,"As a first generation, ardent fan of the Moody Blues, I was very happy to finally see a comprehensive, quality treatment of this classic band. But be warned, this is not the type of thing you pop in the DVD player and watch repeatedly.  The history is all there and so are all the players that have been a part of the Moody's dynasty. (With the exception of Patrick Moraz, and Ray Thomas who's contributions are from old footage) I mean, let's be honest...How many times will anyone really sit through the Disc I docummentary? ..and the video's on Disc II are all readily available on other compilations with the exception of the historical footage from the bands ""Octave"" coming-out party.  Certainly the rare songs are Disc III are nice, but over-all it really is a product for the die-hards.  For the casual fan there are better things out there for you in relation to the Moodies.",1177891200,8,884,4.617834394904459
2740829,5,B000MRAAJ2,"This documentary traces the history of The Moody Blues from their begining to the present day. It has interviews with current members Justin Hayward, John Lodge, and Grahame Edge. Former members Mike Pinder and Denny Laine (later of Paul McCartney Wings)also are interviewed. People who had a hand in their history, Eric Burdon, Marty Wilde, Tony Clarke, etc, also are featured. It begins with the bands orgins in Birmingham England, thru their breakthrough Album, Days of Future passed, through their late sixites and early seventies success, their mid seventies break, their comeback in the eighties, their famous Red Rocks show, and their work in recent years. Disc 2 features extended interviews, and six Moody Blues videos which are Go Now, Steppin in a Slide Zone, No more lies, Your wildest dreams, I know you're out there somewhere, and their comeback party in 1978. This set is a must for Moody Blues fans young and old.

After watching this, you might ask: WHY ARENT THE MOODY BLUES IN THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME??!!??",1177545600,30,1032,4.931034482758621
2740830,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I have the British inport DVD which has already been released. The DVD has interviews with Founding Members Mike Pinder, Denny Laine (later with Paul McCartney and Wings) and Graeme Edge (who is still with the band). Also current members Justin Hayward and John Lodge who both joined the band in the mid 60's.  Many other interviews as well. Lots of rare vintage video.  Traces history to the present.

Minor Disappointments:  Unfortunately Ray Thomas who retired in 2003 is only shown in previously available interviews and Patrick Moraz chose not to participate.  The last portion of the video would have been better if long time backing musicians Paul Bliss and Gordon Marshall would have been interviewed instead of the recently added Flautist Norda.

All and all it is the ultimate recorded history of the band.",1174089600,61,816,5.007407407407407
2740861,5,B000MRAAJ2,"For anyone really interested in the Moody Blues, this 153 minute long documentary released in 2006 hits many of the significant events in the band's history.  Largely consisting of interviews with members of the band, and those with connected with the music industry, the documentary provides a wealth of information.  It begins with teenage boys in Birmingham, England, discovering a love for music, and forming their own band, and then following the events that led to the formation of what would eventually become the Moody Blues, one of the groundbreaking progressive rock bands of the 1960's and 1970's.

Listening to the various interviews, what's amazing is the depth and clarity of the memories that most involved have, of events that took place over forty years ago!  The tone is mostly warm and positive, although there is some bitterness when the band recounts how they were ripped off by their ""management"", and never received the royalties for their first hit Go Now.  Another fascinating aspect, is the tightness of the musical community in Britain at the time, as the Moodies once toured  with The Beatles, and also hung out with The Rolling Stones, and The Animals.

One of the key events in the band's early history was the departure of Denny Laine, and the reformation of the Moodies with bass player John Lodge and guitarist Justin Hayward.  This lineup's first album was the masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-Of-Future-Passed/dp/B001C3I4UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days Of Future Passed</a>&nbsp;(1967), a landmark recording in history of progressive rock.  On the strength of this majestic effort, the band had found their signature sound, and then entered their remarkably productive golden period (1967-72), when they produced an amazing string of seven hit albums.

Interestingly, the band takes credit for popularizing the gatefold type album sleeve, and seeking more creative control, in 1969 they formed Threshold Records a subsidiary of Decca Records.  The assertion that the band found that it had over relieved on overdubbing, is quite remarkable.  As a result, the band streamlined their sound for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Question-Of-Balance/dp/B001C3KMAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Question Of Balance</a>&nbsp;(1970),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Every-Good-Boy-Deserves-Favour/dp/B0018LMZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Every Good Boy Deserves Favour</a>&nbsp;(1971), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seventh-Sojourn/dp/B001C3FR5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seventh Sojourn</a>&nbsp;(1972) albums, focusing on creating music that they could reproduce live.  The documentary devotes very little time to these recordings, or this time period.

The Moodies went on hiatus in 1974, as some of the members did solo projects, and Hayward scored a hit with Forever Autumn.  Reforming in 1977, the recording of the album Octave proved to be a difficult experience, as Mike Pinder drifted away from the group.  As they Moodies were preparing to tour, Pinder unexpectedly declined to participate, creating hard feelings that apparently still run quite deep.  Pinder eventually left the band, and though it is not mentioned, apparently took legal action against the remaining members.

Time is devoted to the band's major lineup changes, as ex-Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz who replaced Pinder, and Moraz in turn was replaced by keyboardist Bias Boshell.  According to drummer Graeme Edge, in the late 80's he began to feel that he did not have the energy to play at full strength throughout an entire live performance.  This led to the addition of a second drummer in 1991 for their live shows.  Apparently due to health concerns, Roy Thomas retired in 2003.  The band replaced him with classically trained flautist Norda Mullen, a Mississippi native.  Interestingly, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson is featured expressing interest in the possibility of replacing Thomas.

After floundering for a while, the band experienced resurgence in popularity in the mid 80's.  Although the band's days of mega-stardom had clearly past, the Moodies have a solid fan base, and continue to tour and occasionally record.  A major event was the 1992 concert at Red Rock, which featured the band playing songs from Days Of Future Past, accompanied by an orchestra.  This supposedly one-time event, led to the band performing with an orchestra for some years.  The documentary closes with the thought that the Moodies will remain viable, as long as John Lodge, Justin Hayward, and Graeme Edge, continue to be the heart of the band.

Classic Artists may a bit uneven, giving in depth coverage to some less significant subjects, while kind of glossing over other seemingly more significant events.  The documentary doesn't sugarcoat certain sensitive  subjects, such as the band's lack of respect in the UK press, or falling away from the cutting edge of music.  Producer Tony Clarke's contributions were so critical to the band's sound, that he was regarded as the ""sixth Moodie"", and recovering from his departure, was another major hurdle for the band to overcome.  Unfortunately, not much is heard from Ray Thomas, and perhaps to compensate for this, Mike Pinder who left in the 70's, seems to get as much or more face time than Lodge, Edge, or Hayward.  Besides footage from music videos, there seems to be few actual clips of live performances, prior to the 1990's.  Overall, the documentary still contains a wealth of information, and is well worth seeing, for the huge number of interview clips.",1328227200,2,5710,5.77326968973747
2740862,5,B000MRAAJ2,This was an excellent movie that really went into depth about the lives and backgrounds of this really great band. I learned an awful lot about each of the members and about others of their times zone. I really enjoyed it and the music contained in it. I would definitely recommend it to any Moody Blues fan.,1309824000,,308,4.421052631578948
2740863,4,B000MRAAJ2,"First of all, I've been familiar with the music of The Moody Blues since at least the mid-1970s, maybe even earlier than that.  I still have vinyl copies of some of their albums, e.g., ""In Search of the Lost Chord"", and ""On the Threshold of a Dream"", and I am familiar with their music from ""Days of Future Past"" through at least ""Sur la Mer.""  I kind of lost track of them after that, but they remain a personal favorite.

This DVD includes extensive footage of all stages of the history of The Moody Blues, as well as lots of interview footage with the long-term principles of the band - Graeme Edge, John Lodge, Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and Ray Thomas, as well as others who were involved with the band through the years.  I found these reflective interviews to be fascinating, and to provide insights into not only the history of the band, but into their origins, interests, challenges, philosophies, and goals.

If all I based this review on was the content of the interviews then this DVD would earn a clear 5 star rating.  However, there is more to a documentary than content.  There is also quality of film, editing, and presentation.  The footage of the band through the years was culled from a variety of sources, some better than others, and the interviews were, frankly, not staged very well.  They almost came across as being somewhat amateurish.  They were, nevertheless, engaging.

I enjoyed sitting through the entire 152 minutes of the DVD.

Perhaps the reason I enjoyed the experience so much is that, as is clearly showed in this documentary, The Moody Blues are a class act.  They generated music spanning a wide range of styles, including pop, rock, psychedelic, folk, and concept music, and more.  I still enjoy music of The Moody Blues, and at least some of their tracks appear regularly on my iPod playlists, and on radio stations I prefer.  Their music is timeless.  They are also great performers and are known for treating their fans well.  It's a tribute to them that they and their music are still so well known, and three members of the group were still touring as recently as 2011...I haven't heard anything about a 2012 tour.

Anyway, this is a 5-star experience for the dedicated Moody Blues fan, and probably a 4-star offering for everyone else...so I'll post this as a 4 star product.

Great stuff though!",1299888000,2,2344,4.687041564792176
2740864,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I love this DVD disc. On this disc the story of The Moody Blues is told from the very beginning with interviews with the band members and many others who were working with them in many stages of the music and recordings. I'm so very glad I bought this DVD disc but I must say that I love the music they play and all about them all band members, actually Justin hayward is my most favorit, I'm simply saying I am a huge fan of The Moody Blues.",1269475200,,442,4.034090909090909
2740865,4,B000MRAAJ2,"This is an excellent video, full of interviews and insights into The Moody Blues.  Alot of questions I had about the history of the band were finally answered.  I'm a fan and this is a wonderfully long video about the group, perhaps a little short on any of their music but I'm glad I got it!",1268611200,,292,4.196428571428571
2740866,5,B000MRAAJ2,"This, especially for the price paid, is a very good documentary that gets deep into the roots of the Moody Blues. While other works tend to forget the Moodies existed before ""Days of Future Passed"", this one explores the days of the Birmingham Beat with interviews from those who were involved and rare and unseen photos. This leads you into the group's ""Go Now"" period through to their super stardom. One of the things this doc has is Mike Pinder's and Denny Laine's involvement which is very enjoyable. The CD that comes with the documentary has very early tracks that include recordings made by the group at the Marquee Club plus other recordings made by the members in previous bands. The historical significance of the tracks is very valuable to true Moody Blues fans. This story also includes Mike Pinder's leaving the band, something that was often glossed over in the past by the other members of the band. It's discussed and light is shed on the situation as it stood. The end of all this brings you to today's band with interviews of new members and footage of the Moodies in concert. The one downfall of the 245 minute footage is that it's in Dolby Digital Mono. But don't let that stop you. This 2 DVD, 1 CD (22 minutes) set also comes with a 20 page booklet and is everything ""Legend of a Band"" is not. As said in the title, very thorough and very enjoyable.",1225670400,3,1371,4.532258064516129
2740867,5,B000MRAAJ2,"We really enjoyed this DVD.  We especially enjoyed the interviews with Mike Pinder, but missed Ray Thomas and are still wondering what happened to him!  I would highly recommend this to all Moody Blues fans.",1214784000,2,207,4.885714285714286
2740868,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I've been a huge Moody Blues fan for 40 years now. I was fortunate enough to see them in the Fillmore East when they first came to the US. I saw them recently on their latest tour 3/08. They've been a mainstay in my life and very important to me.

The two disks have some great interviews, but I can never get enough of them anyway. Even if you have a passing interest in the group, the interviews are entertaining and interesting. Remember, these guys were part of the British Invasion and really changed the face of music in the 60's.

In my opinion, the fact that the Moody Blues are NOT in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame causes it to have very little credibility with me. I mean, they were the first group to release a record using the mellotron for gosh sakes!",1208649600,4,765,4.232876712328767
2740869,4,B000MRAAJ2,"Being an ardent M.B. Fan for almost 20 years I was excited when I learned about this release. Disc one is an excellent documentary of the band with interviews of members including ""Mike Pinder"" and ""Denny Laine"" and I was very impressed with disc one. However when it came to disc two , the package said it would contain rare archive footage. B.S.! All disc two had was a crappy video of ""Go Now"" and the rest were video's from the 80's which have been released countless times on various dvd's. ( There is an excellent , but rare dvd entitiled ""Nights in white satin"" , which has the early footage of the classic lineup.) As for disc three it was ok if want old recordings , but aside from Justin Hayward's ""London is behind me"", I could have done without the disc. However if you Love M.B.,than I do think it is worth getting. I even plan on purchasing the Classic artist dvd release on ""Yes"" this Jan, And Hope that Classic Artist will hopefully be able to make a release on ""Fleetwood Mac"" and ""Deep Purple"".",1198886400,3,1012,4.388297872340425
2740870,3,B000MRAAJ2,"Being a huge follower I bought this DVD set. I would say it is ok but the material could have been presented in just one DVD.Thought there was too much emphasis on the original band and would have liked more music of the band included.
The 2nd DVD has a lot of repetion from the first one.
Did not watch the 3rd DVD as I am not at all interested in the original group led by Denny Laine.
Overall OK but if you can rent it rather than buy it that would be preferable.
I think the previous reviewers have overrated this product.",1194220800,3,526,4.116504854368932

2740882,5,B000MRAAJ2,"While the totality of the 3 discs could have been put
on one disc in today's modern age, I thorougly enjoyed
the over 2 1/2 hours of disc one and the 92mins. of
disc 2.  I have been a fan since 1972 and enjoyed getting
to know the Moodies a little better, as well as their history.
The Mike Pinder ""confession"" is priceless as are the nu-
merous anecdotes that are included.
The third disc is an audio cd of approx. 22mins that includes
early Moodies at the Marquee Club, circa 1964 and various
bands that spawned the Moodies.  Not very impressive, but
undoubtedly will please Moody completists.
Fans of Denny Laine will revel at the many snippets of Denny
reminiscing about the old days.",1188950400,3,688,4.496
2740883,5,B000MRAAJ2,"This is a definitive DVD that goes back to the Original Moodies to the current line up.  All founding members are interviewed, including Denny Laine & Mike Pinder, which is a real treat. The DVD will take you back to 1964 when the band first started & each member has their own recollections & memories.  You'll even see the drummer, Greame Edge appearing to be a bit ticked off at Mike Pinder for something that happened years ago.  Mike seems to have his own version of the situation.  It's quite interesting.  Some interviews can be quite a drag, but not this one.  The package also includes a bonus DVD with additional interviews that were not included in the first DVD and a CD with recordings from the band members prior to the Moodie days.  This is a must have for any Moodies fan!",1186099200,5,788,4.468531468531468
2740884,5,B000MRAAJ2,"Excellent anthology on the band even though saidly Ray Thomas is missing on up to date interviews. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that is a big Moody Blues fan. The only small gripe I have with it is that they skim through the seven classic albums rather fast. Nevertheless, Order the DVD, it is really worth it. Also included is a bonus CD of ""Rarities"" which are ""ok"" & a DVD of promotional videos which are nice to see if you remember when MTV showed them in heavy rotation.

2740885,5,B000MRAAJ2,This DVD covers it all from the R&B beginnings to now.  Interviews with the Moodies themselves plus all the folks that were involved with the Band past and present.  Very entertaining and enlightning.  Denny Laine and other members of the British music scene as well as the engaging and much-missed Mike Pinder & Ray Thomas.

2740887,5,B000MRAAJ2,"There's a lot of Moodies stuff out there. This 3-disc set doesn't offer a lot of their music, though. Disc 3 is a cd of early, mostly unreleased tunes, some not too clear. Disc 2 is added interviews not included on dics 1 with additional music videos - OK, but not great. Disc 1, however, is loaded with interviews and a breakdown of all that went into EACH album. (excluding most recent releases, issued after this DVD). My favorite section? The long lost (forgotten ?) Mike Pinder who can't say a bad thing about his time with the group, including his departure during the making of ""Octave"". Knowing the history of his melotron (he made his own)was facinating. Don't get this DVD set thinking you'll hear lots of them performing. There are better discs out there. BUT if you want to know all about the group members and their origins with a story behind each album,this is the thing.",1182816000,7,886,4.578616352201258
2740888,4,B000MRAAJ2,"I agree here with two other reviewers.  Disc 2 is full of mostly boring interviews with various people, some who aren't even discussing the Moody Blues' music, but wild parties and the early days of Decca(?).  Most of the videos included can be seen in better form on the Legend of a Band DVD, and the footage of the release party for Octave is embarrassing to be caught watching.  The only thing worse would have to be actually attending.

Disc 3 contains some mostly unimpressive recordings of pre-Moody cuts by bandmates' former groups.

Disc 1 is the most important and, while I truly appreciate the length of the documentary, does anyone really want to know THAT much about the Denny Laine era of the group?  They should have spent more time on the years of '67 to the present and, may I add, they skipped discussing some albums entirely (The Other Side of Life, Keys of the Kingdom, and Strange Times).  There are some great moments here, and I'm glad it's authorized, but I would still like to see a book come out.  Would I buy this again?  Well, no, but I wouldn't sell my copy either.  I would say to anyone looking these reviews over and musing over this product, don't buy it unless you're a rather dedicated fan.  Go the alternative route and purchase Legend of a Band, because it's more entertaining and takes less time to get through.",1182816000,2,1348,4.551867219917012
2740889,5,B000MRAAJ2,"There is no official 'biography' of the band, but there are many filmed bits and pieces floating around that are familiar to Moody fandom.  This dvd, however, brings together a plethora of fresh material that not only provides a rich sense of the band's history and the sources of its success, but also answers questions concerning the departures from the band of Denny Laine, Mike Pinder, and Ray Thomas.  It is exceptionally candid.  Things are said that one does not expect to hear said in a day of rabid, unending litigation.  There are some omissions--no interviews with Gordon Marshall or Paul Bliss (nor from Patrick Moraz, though no one would expect him to make himself available) and the odd overlooking of the Keys to the Kingdom album and some other later work.  It is especially nice to see the members of the band in their native habitats--Justin in Monaco, Graeme in Florida, etc.

The focus is exclusively on the music; there is nothing, e.g., on John's love of golf and Rhone wines or on any of the band's philanthropic work.  There is also next to nothing on their families, except for some asides on key divorces.  The subsidiary material on the second disc (fulsome video of the garden party launch for Octave, e.g.) is also worthwhile.  This dvd does not tell you everything but it tells you much more than you might expect and the production values are very high.  Moody fans will also recognize some of their number in the audience and actually hear a few of them interviewed.

Highly recommended; don't miss it.",1182556800,8,1534,4.750943396226415
2740890,3,B000MRAAJ2,"This DVD documentary of The Moody Blues is okay for watching maybe once.  I mean, there were lots of interesting facts about The Moody Blues, most of which I've already learned about on their ""Legend of a Band"" DVD.  However, this DVD does go into great detail about the earlier Denny Laine days.  In fact, Denny Laine today has a lot of dialogue to share about their humble beginnings (the ""Go Now"" days) as the first original member of The Moody Blues.  The main DVD of this The Moody Blues DVD (Disc One) is about 2 and a half hours long.  The first 48 minutes is about the Denny Laine days before John Lodge and Justin Hayward.  And then this documentary goes into about 50 minutes of their main seven albums (""Days of Future Passed"" through to ""Seventh Sojourn"").  It seems like they blew though discussing these albums rather quickly.  And then the last 50 minutes discussed their follow-up albums up through today.

Even some artists like Ian Anderson (of Jethro Tull) and Eric Burdon (The Animals) were here to discuss their involvement (or their non-involvement) with The Moody Blues.

The second DVD starts with about an hour of insignificant dialogue from some of the band members and others involved with The Moody Blues.  Nothing very interesting here.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again.  It just went nowhere all through it.  It is followed by some of their music videos starting with a simulated video of ""Go Now"" up through ""No More Lies.""  What I didn't like about the videos here are that they cropped them to have a simulated wide screen effect.  The top and the bottom of the videos were cut off.  On the ""Legend of a Band"" DVD, the videos are presented in their correct full screen version.  Plus, on the ""Legend of a Band"" DVD, it had the video of ""The Other Side of Life"" which I think is a great (and important) video.

The third disc in this package is a 22 minute CD of some really scratchy sounding recorded songs from Saints and Sinners, El Riot and the Rebels, Gerry Levene and the Avengers, The Carpet Baggers, Denny Laine and the Diplomats, an early Justin Hayward song and an early Moody Blues demo.  It's early history of the bands where some of these guys came from before The Moody Blues, so it may have some value to some serious Moody Blues completists.

On this documentary, you do get a lot of discussion from Mike Pinder, Graeme Edge, Denny Laine, and some from John Lodge and Justin Hayward.  And also Ian Anderson and Eric Burdon.  It's funny, you know if Eric Burdon wore some wire glasses, he would look exactly like the real-life image of Grandpa Simpson (from the TV show ""The Simpsons).

And it seems to be rather strange how Patrick Moraz remains such a mystique.  You never see him on any documentaries of The Moody Blues, or even Yes.  Why is he so hard to get a hold of?  I'd like to hear some of his personal input of his impressive career.

Most people may just want to rent this Moody Blues DVD first.  I mean, there is a lot of unnecessary information put together in this 3 disc set.  I wish it were just released as a single DVD (just Disc One), at half the cost than what this was.  To be honest, I still think ""Legend of a Band"" is a better documentary of The Moody Blues (even though it barely talks about the ""Go Now"" days, and that it only covered The Moody Blues up to about 1990).  I guess it doesn't hurt to own both, but the more casual Moody Blues fan may be more satisfied with the ""Legend of a Band"" documentary.",1181779200,9,3493,4.434850863422292

Well worth the effort adding it to your collection...great for newbie fans also, as it offers a great insight into where they came from musically and the journey they have taken since.",1418428800,,255,5.095238095238095

8171213,5,B000MRAAJ2,"It's the Moody Blues, enough said! Michael Pinder is with them, with the melotron. It's not new, but they never get old. My motto is, if it says the Moody Blues, I buy it. You can never go wrong. The group stands alone and I don't think we will ever have another group like them, in our lifetime. What is it? Oh, six decades now.",1407369600,,329,4.076923076923077

8171216,5,B000MRAAJ2,"If you're looking for information on the Moody Blues, this is what you need. Through interviews with members of the band (both past and present), you'll know a lot more about this somewhat underrated group. You'll hear stories, know details and understand the troubles within the band from the very beginning, when it wasn't even the Moodies yet, until 2006. As if the 2:32h documentary wasn't enough, you still got some video promos, photos and extra interviews on a second DVD. Also, there is a CD with rare songs.",1391558400,,516,4.808988764044944
8171217,5,B000MRAAJ2,I've been a fan of the Moody Blues for over forty years and marvel at the fact that they're still going strong today. Many young people have become fans since I first experienced their music in 1970. I think they will go down as one of the best groups in the history of rock n roll and the fact that they're still touring backs that up. A good DVD for any Moody Blues fan,1371254400,,371,4.027027027027027
8171218,5,B000MRAAJ2,"I bought the Moody Blues movie on my Kindle Fire about a month ago and really loved it. I was fascinated by how the Moody Blues formed in the 60s and how they continued to put out the good music to this day. I got into the Moody Blues when I bought their album Time Traveler a few years ago and became hooked on the songs. I really enjoyed the movie. The only thing I felt sad about is Ray Thomas's retirement from the Moody Blues in 2003 due to his health problems. To me, Ray Thomas will always be a part of the Moody Blues and I do understand why he wanted to retire from the music. I will recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Moody Blues.",1367625600,,656,3.9398496240601504
