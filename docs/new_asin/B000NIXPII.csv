8178198,2,B000NIXPII,"I'm disappointed in this purchase. It's a collection of Movietone newsreels containing fragments of speeches. The video quality is often poor, overexposed with too much contrast. (I know better quality video exists of the same speeches and events.)  The video is often out of sync with the audio, also. Regardless, I'm not throwing it away!
