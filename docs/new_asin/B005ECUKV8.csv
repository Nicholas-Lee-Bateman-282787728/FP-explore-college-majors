Ok, maybe he's not as evil as Eric Cartman but if u enjoy toilet humor mixed with political incorrectness and every genre of human nature & pop culture being laughed at, this is the set for u. It also helps if u have the sense of humor of an 8yr old boy like my husband & myself. We laugh together every time we watch any episode of family guy. Peter is off the rails, Lois is a homemaking secret sexpot, Meg a teenage girl tortured by everyone in the family, Chris is a masturbating younger version of his father & Brian, the talking dog tries so hard to politically correct that his holier than thou persona is inexplicable. You will laugh yourself silly or maybe be offended. Family Guy may not be for everyone, including children, but I laughed the first time I watched it and still laugh when I re-watch it. Hopefully u will too.",1370995200,,906,4.398809523809524
