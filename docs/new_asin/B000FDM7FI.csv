8121268,3,B000FDM7FI,"If you are brand new to fitness this video may be great for you, but if you exercise on a regular basis and are just looking for something new you may find it a little cheesy!  A lot of the same repetitve moves and the instructor doesnt even seem to have a real ""little one"" with her.  Too easy and simple for me...need more of a challenge.  Also a lot of times she was ""off beat"" with the music and that drives me nuts!  haha",1212192000,,426,3.976470588235294
8121269,2,B000FDM7FI,"This DVD offers a few repetitive exercises.  Music is quite boring and also very repetitive.  Average production quality.  Overall an effective, but very boring workout.  Would not buy this again.",1199491200,,196,5.433333333333334
8121270,5,B000FDM7FI,I was given this dvd to try and must say it's a great workout for anyone! I'm not a mom so I did it at home using a chair for balance instead of a stroller. Awesome workout...easy to follow and works every single part of the body. Highly recommend it!,1155600000,,251,4.04
8121271,5,B000FDM7FI,This workout is great to do outdoors with young children. It has helped me to tone my body and lose my pregnancy weight. It is very easy to follow. I have recommended this DVD to numerous friends.,1153267200,3,196,4.324324324324325
8121272,5,B000FDM7FI,I love this workout.  It is designed for outdoor use but I even do it inside and my two year old daughter likes to pretend she is working out with me.  It is effective and doesn't get dull.,1153008000,,189,3.9473684210526314
8121273,5,B000FDM7FI,Sara's workout is awesome!  Excercising with your child really lets you stay in shape after having a baby.  The intense workout has me in the best shape of my life.  My arms and legs are stronger than they have ever been.  I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants a total body workout and especially moms who want to stay in shape without bringing their children to the gym.,1151971200,,382,4.414285714285715
8121274,5,B000FDM7FI,"Sara's stroller workout is awesome!  I have worked-out my entire life and after I had my twins I just didn't have the time I used to spend at the gym to get my workout in!  The workout is challenging and fun, and I love being able to get a total body workout in one session.  I highly recommend this to any busy parent that has the desire to lose weight, feel good about themselves, and look great with exercise!",1146096000,3,412,4.189873417721519
8121275,5,B000FDM7FI,"I have been doing this workout for a few months.  I have lost 15 pounds and toned my whole body.  This video is great because you can excercise with your baby.  My son loves riding outside in the stroller, and it is a great way for me to get my excercise.  Even if it is raining, I can do the workout inside.  I definitely recommend this Stroller Workout DVD!!!",1145318400,,361,4.173913043478261
