7931630,5,B000056AVX,"Six Gun Rhythm is a classic example of the 1930s B-Western genre and a must see film for fans of Tex Fletcher (don't miss the movie's closing gunfight / fistfight in a sandstorm).
I had the pleasure of knowing ""The Lonesome Cowboy"" in the early 1970s. I was a frequent guest in his Harrison New York home, where I spent dozens of hours over many months talking one-on-one with him. He was fascinating to listen to, especially his adventures from the mid-1920's after leaving home at age 15 (1924), through his cowboy days in South Dakota, and to his experiences in the movies in the 1930's. He had a strong interest in history and an amazing power of recall. He was blessed with a beautiful wife (Ada Mae) and five wonderful children (Robert, Jayne, Kathy, George, and Michael). I have the fond memory of sitting with his family during one of his live performances in Westchester County.
Sadly, he passed away on March 14, 1987, but I will never forget the time I spent with him.",1373673600,2,979,4.568181818181818

7931632,5,B000056AVX,"Six Gun Rhythm, starring New York radio cowpoke Tex Fletcher, stands out as a classic of the B-Western genre that almost wasn't.

Singing cowboy Tex Fletcher was best known in the early 1930s as the genial singing cowboy host of several radio programs in New York and New Jersey. After a run at WFAS in White Plains, NY, Tex was scooped up by WOR radio, then a part of the coast to coast Mutual Network, replacing close friend, cowboy star Tex Ritter (Fletcher remained with WWOR on and off for more than 20 years, going off the air in 1957).

After appearing in several Broadway productions, including ""Howdy Stranger"" in 1937, Tex became a member of popular radio hillbilly group, ""Tom Emerson's Mountaineers,"" then broadcasting nationwide over WMCA and affiliates, and with whom he appeared in the Hollywood musical production of ""Down on The Barn"" in 1938 and with whom he toured the country.

This initial movie appearance brought the handsome singer to the attention of Hollywood talent scouts looking for a fresh face to star in a new series of sagebrush musicals planned by Acadia Productions to be made by Grand National Pictures, again taking the place of Tex Ritter who had moved on to another studio.

Upon release of the series' first film ""Six-Gun Rhythm,"" Grand National went belly-up, leaving the oater in limited distribution and its newest star in the lurch. Tex literally ""took the bull by the horns"" and set out on a one-man promotional tour for the film of the Northeast US and Canada, occasionally accompanied by friend Ritter.

Tex personally booked and traveled to each movie house, opening the showing with a couple of songs and then signing autographs for fans after the film was over. This campaign is what movie historians believe to be the reason the B-Western has enjoyed such a long shelf life and has been held in such high esteem among collectors, as it would have otherwise been virtually unknown. The movie's closing gunfight/fistfight in a sandstorm is considered a classic of the genre.

Afterward, Tex had no desire to return to Hollywood and turned down all subsequent offers to continue the series from other movie production companies, and other offers to return to Hollywood - some of which continued into the 1980s - opting instead to focus on radio, recordings  and live performances, retiring from show business in the early 1970s.",1174089600,,2376,4.895522388059701
