1248105,3,B00001ZWBK,"After the beautiful ""Far From Heaven"" and the dazzling ""Velvet Goldmine"", I was curious to see Todd Haynes' first film. Despite being made on a shoe-string budget and featuring unknown actors, ""Poison"" still manages to be a visually innovative, provocative and intelligent film. The film is made up of three seperate stories interwoven together. In ""Hero"", which takes place in the early 80's and is filmed in documentary style, a young boy kills his father, and the community tries to figure out why. In ""Horror"", which looks like a campy old black and white horror film, a scientist manages to turn the human sex drive into a serem, and then becomes a sexually predatory leper when he accidently drinks it. In ""Homo"", a man in prison in the early 20th century becomes obsessed with a fellow inmate who he watched being abused years before in a reformatory. Initially, the stories seem to have nothing in common, but the more the film goes on you start to see the connection ... they all focus on the darker side of human sexuality, and its consequences. Overall, this is an interesting first film by a terrific director who is just starting to hit his stride.",1065139200,4,1161,4.752475247524752
1248106,5,B00001ZWBK,"Todd Haynes's penchant for postmodern parody (recently displayed in the deliberately garish melodrama _Far From Heaven_) can be seen in _Poison_, his first feature film. Haynes invokes obscure Poverty-Row horror films and television documentaries, among other cinematic forms. Some of the images are lovely, some are ugly, and some are extremely difficult to watch. All represent, in one form or another, French writer Jean Genet's view of sexuality -- pessimistic and frequently angry, but never entirely bleak.
This film was one of the infamous ""NEA 4"" projects that led then-Senator Jesse Helms to impose standards of decency on the National Endowment for the Arts. _Poison_ may be best known for the scandal it generated inside Washington's corridors of power, but it's still a brilliant film.
Now, the bad news: Video and audio transfers on this DVD are poor, with numerous print flaws, artifacts and distortion.  But the full-frame transfer accurately represents the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  The only extras are a slightly decrepit trailer and a solid, informative audio commentary from the director, the producer and the editor.",1047859200,8,1162,5.414364640883978
1248107,4,B00001ZWBK,"Haynes attempts to present a concept through three different stories or perspectives, ""Hero"", ""Horror"", and ""Homo"".  The three stories interject one another in crucial moments leaving the audience thinking about what Haynes is trying to tell us.  In ""Hero"", a child is painted as a trouble maker who shot his abusive father when he was attacking his deceitful mother.  The second story, ""Horror"", depicts a scientist who is in the search of truth, but by mistake becomes contaminated as a leper.  ""Homo"" presents the story of a gay convict who has grown up in institutions and jails where he meets another guy who went to the same reformatory school as him.  The film will leave the audience pondering and reflecting what the stories had in common.",1043107200,2,748,4.904761904761905
1248108,2,B00001ZWBK,"Three stories, three styles, all with one common message screaming to be let out in the film ""Poison,"" which is about as depraved a film as one can watch. The film is a monument to style over substance, a narrative that is as complex as it is maddening. Bold in vision and yet weak in its overall connection to the audience, the directorial effort of Todd Haynes is sumptuous yet left me parched for depth and understanding.
There is a common theme among the three disjointed stories, all of which have basically nothing to do with one another except their common message. There's ""Hero,"" the documentary-style story of a family torn apart by one son's act of murder against his father; ""Horror,"" the sci-fi spoof of a brilliant scientist out to tame the human hormonal system, only to ingest his own experiment and become the equivalent of Frankenstein's ghastly creation. And ""Homo,"" the most subtle of the three, done in a welcomed mainstream style, explores the effects of homosexual lust and jealousy among the inmates of an early 20th century prison.
The message is everpresent through these stories, one that deals greatly with the differences in society, culture, and emotion. From the outcast child of ""Hero"" to the homosexuality that is the central focus of the prison drama, the script never fails in showing us the consequences of being different, as well as what becomes of those who capitalize on those differences. This makes for moments of sheer fright, from the relentless bullying of a prison inmate, to the disturbing physical state of the decrepit scientist.
Each of these stories are interwoven in a process that is dazzling, full of vision, but in unsuccessful in trying to hide the movie's fatal flaw. Each story is given a unique appearance: from the black and white classic feel of ""Horror,"" to the documentary approach used in ""Hero,"" Haynes creates a sensory assault that is visionary and creates a feeling of wonderment over its audacious technique.
Yet, despite this glorious wallow in stylish excess, there is a gaping void of emotional emptiness that permeates the three stories, which, taken in this context, appear stitched together so as to hide the absence of connectivity with the audience. There's never any time devoted to developing a sense of caring for the characters, or to understanding the human side of their situations, and if one cannot care for them, one cannot hope to feel anything for the movie as a whole.
As a style over substance film, ""Poison"" ranks among the very best in independent cinema, evoking an atmosphere of dismal degredation. Followers of Haynes's work will appreciate the movie, though I'm not so sure that first-timers will be so welcoming. The pastiche of stories is disconnected and never gains much momentum; Haynes gives the movie a point, but gets right to it without any buildup.",1005091200,13,2854,4.947916666666667
1248109,4,B00001ZWBK,"Beautiful, spare, elegant cinematography pared with a sophisticated marriage of irony, sincerity, homage and synthesis -- so exquisitely pomo it's heartbreaking.
The connections between the three narratives aren't immediately obvious; repeated viewings make this film all the more rich.
But then those thinking about buying this DVD probably don't need me to convince them.

1248110,3,B00001ZWBK,"""Poison"" was an early film by Todd Haynes and contains three stories about bizarre lives, namely: a doctor who ingested a deadly sex hormone that left him disfigured and highly contagious, a suburban  nightmare about a masochistic/saintly child who killed his father, and a  prison story by Genet. The prison story was the least experimental and most  successful of the three. Haynes explored the power games, sexual needs, and  embittered lives of the inmates and the strange way love was defined by  those involved. The doctor's story was extremely melodramatic and the  suburban story was mainly about the strange personalities inhabiting the  neighborhood. All things considered it was, and probably was intended to  be, an exploration of just how abnormal normal can be in some  circumstances. Not an enjoyable picture, but it was thought provoking.",957139200,5,854,5.266666666666667
1248111,1,B00001ZWBK,"I don't like to give up, but Poison wins.  I very  much hope that those who see this film first will still be willing to watch Haynes 'Safe', one of the most interesting films I've ever seen.
Those who praise this one  offer no particularly  creditable reasons.  Parts of the homosexual  segments are damned sexy, maybe the rest was thrown in as window  dressing.

1248113,5,B00001ZWBK,"When I saw this film for the first time I left the theater impressed with Todd Haynes' genius. The film is actually a trilogy. One story is about John Broom's life in prison and the nuances of sex and love between men  there, with flashbacks to Broom's life as a boy in a reformatory. Here, we  get a glimpse of adolescent boys and their discovery of sexuality and the  hierarchies of the ""counterfeit world of men among men."" It feels  like one is coming in and out of a dream state. The second is done in the  form of a documentary, ""Where is Richie Beacon?"" - after shooting  his father, his mom claims Richie just ""flew away... out the  window"". It's a story about how creepy suburban America really is. The  third is a B&W, 1950-ish sci-fi story about a man deteriorating with a  disease (that could well be AIDS) and the psychological effect it has on  him. ""Poison"" is for the philosophically inclined. Not for the  homophobic and/or faint-hearted. It is a masterpiece in its scope and  execution. Very visual and sometimes very disturbing. It touches on the  maddening effects of suburbia, modern life, civilization, and the human  condition. A MUST SEE for the philosophy student. not easy to follow. VERY  COMPLEX. I've got it on VHS and will purchase DVD soon. If you like films  with substance this one won't disappoint you!",946512000,39,1336,4.645299145299146

It's a lot more than that, especially as Genet's own work is filled with power shifts, illusion and metaphor, but I tend to get lost in the technical details of Poison which still seem revolutionary.

It is an experimental film that cuts back and forth between three different stories, all in different style and genre. Homo is reminiscent of the Fassbinder film, Querelle with its quick cuts and tight camera work. Hero is a grainy, color faded documentary and Horror is done in the style of a 1960s B sci-fi movie. All have a common theme; sex and how sex translates to power.

I think this falls into the category of experimental movies.  It's one of the movies where at the end you go, ""That was interesting.""  You think about it a little bit longer, and then you move on.  It's not the kind of movie anyone would go out and buy to re-watch it over and over.

1248159,5,B00001ZWBK,"Todd Haynes' brilliant ground-breaking indie Poison has been reissued on DVD, and it's impossible to believe it's 20 years old. Either the film has not aged or it has aged brilliantly; not a jot of the pain, loneliness and the longing for love has been dimmed by the passage of time. (Who else had the balls to tackle a remake of Mildred Pierce?)
  Three intercut stories told simultaneously tell three wildly different tales in the style of very different movie genres, yet each to the same affect. There's a tragedy of suburban love and murder, a prison story and a sci-fi adventure, each about an outsider's fruitless search for love. Haynes certainly knows his Hollywood cliches, and wrenches them from B-movie fodder to brilliant illustrations of the human need for connection.
  The three stories are not pleasant, as they speak of the poison in our society forbidding love. The film is inspired by the writings of Jean Genet. Indeed, the prison sequence is short precise of Our Lady of the Flowers. Framed by silent film-like cards quoting the French master of power and masochism and clearly influenced by the likes of Griffith in the simultaneous yet disparate storytelling and Anger in the fast cuts from horror to beauty, Poison is a film whose images and narrative will stay in the viewers memory.
  Queer cinema at its poisonous best. Yes that's a compliment. And yes, the extras are real extras, not the tack-on crap we're used to getting from Warner Bros.",1306108800,3,1470,4.86
1248160,4,B00001ZWBK,"Filmed in 1990, POISON was an extremely obscure art house film--until Senator Jessie Helms, a hysterical homophobe, threw a public temper tantrum over the fact that it had been financed in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.  Helm's tirade had the effect of piquing public curiosity, and while it never played mainstream cinemas POISON did indeed go on to a wider release on the art house circuit, winning the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival and receiving an unexpectedly rapid release to the homemarket as well.  Thereafter it rapidly returned to the same obscurity from which came.

It is easy to understand why the film never caught on in any broad sense.  It is deliberately ""art house,"" and your ability to ""get"" the film will depend a great deal on your knowledge of the literature and films it references.  In a general sense, the film is inspired by the writings of Jean Genet (1910-1986), a French author associated with the existentialist movement.

A deliberate outsider, Genet spent so much of his youth in and out of prison that he was ultimately threatened with a life sentence as a habitual criminal.  In his writings, Genet fused his homosexual, criminal, and prison adventures into a consistent point of view--one that championed freedom of choice (no matter how unattractive the choice), self-determination (no matter how unfortunate the result), and generally gave the finger to any form of authority (no matter how necessary.)  POISON specifically references three of his most celebrated works: OUR LADY OF THE FLOWERS, THE MIRACLE OF THE ROSE, and THE THIEF'S JOURNAL, all of which were to some extent autobiographical.

At the same time, the film also references a host of other films--so many that it is sometimes difficult to know whether a single reference is deliberate or simply a fluke, an effect that Genet himself would have likely admired.  The most obvious of these references is D.W. Griffith's 1916 silent masterpiece INTOLERANCE, for like that film POISON tells three distinctly stories, cross-cutting between them that they might heighten each other.  Unlike INTOLERANCE, however, each story is also told in a distinctly different cinematic style, and these too seem to reference various other films.

The first of these stories, HOMO, is very specifically drawn from Genet.  It tells the story of a constant criminal and homosexual who, while in prison, meets a man whose repeated sexual humilitation he witnessed when both were children in a reformatory.  He forces the man, who is unwilling mainly due to fear than from morality, into an emotional relationship and later rapes him.  The ""present"" sequences are shot in a murky half-light, the prison presented as a labyrinth of potential sexual destruction.  When the prisoner recalls his youthful past, however, the tone changes to a surrealistic and extremely artificial beauty--not unlike that seen in such films as James Bidgood's PINK NARCISSUS and Fassbinder's QUERELLE.  It is worth pointing out that these different styles are ironic in use: although shot darkly, the events of the ""present"" sequence are only mildly shocking in comparison with the events of the ""past"" sequence, which is shot in a bright and rather romantic style.

HORROR references the 1950s and early 1960s cinematic style of such ""B"" directors as William Castle and Roger Corman, and it frequently borrows cinematic ideas from Rod Sterling's television series THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  In this particular tale, a scientist has labored to isolate the essence of the human sex drive--and succeeds only to ingest the element by accident.  With human sex drive raging out of control in his body, he develops oozing sores, and his physical contacts with others spread the condition.  It is difficult not to read this as a reference to the AIDS epidemic.

The third story, HERO, is actually presented very much like a modern television news story and is told through a series of interviews.  Here, a young boy has shot his father--and then, according to his mother, leaps from the window sill and simply flies away.  Neighbors comment: the boy exposed himself.  School teachers comment: the boy was unnatural, the boy was normal, the boy was creative, the boy was a liar.  A doctor comments: it is possible the boy had a, er, disease of the genitals.  As the story progresses the layers add up--but it leaves us without clearcut answers, much less a clearcut response, and in this last respect it is exactly like the other two stories.

It is extremely, extremely difficult to know how to react to POISON.  It has moments of remarkable beauty, but these are coupled with moments of equally remarkably off-putting disgust.  It is often an erotic film, but the eroticism is tinged and occasionally saturated with revulsion.  And in all of this it is remarkably true to its original source: Genet, whose works typically provoke exactly the same sense of beauty, disgust, sensuality, revulsion, and uncertainty of response.  I cannot say that I like POISON, which was the directorial debut of Todd Haynes, presently best known for FAR FROM HEAVEN--but then, it is not that sort of film; it does not invite you like it, but rather to consider it both in whole and in part.  It strives to be interesting, and in that it is often quite successful.

Unfortunately, it may also be a little too interesting for its own good.  While it certainly has its visceral moments, occasionally to the gag point, it asks us to solve a puzzle from which pieces are missing.  This not a necessarily a bad thing, but in the case of POISON too many pieces have gone astray; it seems deliberately unsolvable.  This may actually be intentional, but if so it was a mistake.  A sense of mystery is one thing, but mystification is another, and given its overall strangeness--not to mention the subject matter--I think it very, very unlikely that it will ever have more than curiosity appeal outside an art house audience.

The DVD package is not bad, but neither is it exceptional.  Although it is presented in its original ratio, some complain that scenes have been cut.  I cannot comment on this point, for I have not seen any print that differs from this one.  The print is reasonable but hardly pristine.  The commentary track, however, is indeed worth a listen.  Recommended, but only if you have a taste for the out of the way.

1248161,2,B00001ZWBK,"Poison (Todd Haynes, 1991)

Todd Haynes has a tendency to try and wrap a lot of stuff into his movies, taking a number of disparate threads and weaving them into a huge, multi-layered tapestry. There are times he succeeds, and when he does, he creates some of the better moments in recent film history. His failures are just as spectacular, for there's never a moment when you can't see the potential of it all. Every time, he almost gets it right, but sometimes there's one fatal flaw that blows it. In the case of Poison, that flaw is that the threads Haynes is attempting to weave together-- a story of a boy who kills his father, another of a doctor who contracts leprosy through his medical experimentation, and a third, based on Jean Genet's novel Our Lady of the Flowers, about the love-hate relationship between two French prisoners-- never coalesce into the overarching weave Haynes envisioned. As a result, the movie has some very good performances that never get anything to lock onto; it's worth watching to see them, but don't be expecting another Superstar or Far from Heaven with this one. **",1165968000,,1107,4.7357512953367875
1248162,4,B00001ZWBK,"Don't be fooled by the label ""Unrated"" expecting to see the same uncut version shown on The Sundance Channel 10 years ago, shortly after the movie's award at their Film Festival. The Fox release has cut certain scenes. In the ""Homo"" storyline, the sex was much more explicit. For example, in the scene where the 2 prisoners are sleeping side by side on the floor, in the video release Broom merely fondles the sleeping Jack. In the original, he does much more--quite daring for a theatrical movie. Perhaps that is why that scene and some others were edited. However, if you didn't see the original TV screening, you would not be aware of these deletions/edits.

Just remember that although the film may be unrated, it is cut.

Watch this film and you'll find out. Based on the works of French writer Jean Genet (who was banned in the US in the 50s for his explicit portrayal of homosexuality), the movie is made up of three different interwoven stories: the first one is about a boy (everyone, from teachers to classmates, considers him ""weird"") who kills his abusive father and then ""flies"" out of his bedroom window, the second is about the sexual obsessions of a young man who has lived most of his life in prison, and the third about a scientist who claims he has distilled the essence of the sex drive, and one day drinks it by accident, turning gradually into a leprous monster, shunned by everyone.

7915141,4,B00001ZWBK,"Poison is more intellectually stimulating than it is entertaining. After or before you watch it, I recommend seeing A Song of Love (Un Chant d'Amour), Jean Genet's only film, a 25-minute short that you can find many places online. Poison is three intercut short films. Homo dedicates itself to Genet through quotes from Our Lady of the Flowers and its portrayal of a gay prison relationship which, compared to Genet's prison film, is outstandingly tame, less visually brilliant, and shies away from its only sex scene (in this *unedited* version). It also gives us an unbearable humiliation scene. Hero and Horror, the other two of the intercut films, also tell us that sex=bad. Horror is a story of a scientist who accidentally drinks his creation, a sex elixir, which gives him ugly and contagious leprosy. Made in 1990, this is can be viewed as an AIDS metaphor. In Hero a boy who sees his mother cheating on his father, kills his father then flies off their suburban balcony. This comes closest in plot (thought not genre) to later Todd Haynes, which is all about forbidden homosexuality in the 1950s/suburbs; i.e., the brilliant Far From Heaven and the lesser Carol. All in all a fascinating look at the early work of Todd Haynes. It made me think a lot about who he is, and how and why he's come to direct his later films.",1504828800,,1328,4.703862660944206
