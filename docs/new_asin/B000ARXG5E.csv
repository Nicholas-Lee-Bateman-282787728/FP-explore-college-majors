2390598,5,B000ARXG5E,"In the end we are the sum total of our doings and we will be faced by those doings at the moment of our death. Or is it our death in every moment that we live, that faces us with what we do? This was my immediate realization upon watching this film.

I could see every person was sincere from their perspective. The underlying message was that our death is stalking us at every moment, and this is what brought about the mystery and the sincerity from all the participants.

As was stated in the film, there is no future, there is no past, there is only the moment, but what they forgot to mention is that moment is continually escaping us as well. This is the lesson that death supplies. Everything that is and has been will escape us. So then there really is nothing we can cling to, and I think this is what the participants were struggling with.

There is no mistaking that Carlos Castaneda was a brilliant man.

The participants deserve 5 stars even though the production itself warrants only 3 stars. I believe that the participants were true within their sincerity upon the perplexity that was confronting them with Carlos.",1136678400,10,1130,4.4975609756097565
2390599,1,B000ARXG5E,"I enjoyed hearing Castaneda's own voice and listening to the interviews but the cheap druggy visuals in the background and ""experimental"" video techniques were distracting and bothersome. I became very tired of it early on. The makers of this work could have shown some interesting material of the places Carlos talked about in his books. (Or any of a number of more interesting visuals than what we get here.) Forget this work and check out the Sustained Action website for more interesting material.",1135900800,4,501,5.048192771084337
2390600,1,B000ARXG5E,"This movie is supposed to be about Carlos Castaneda.

But it really is just an assortment of interviews with unknown disenchanted people who are trying to debunk Castaneda and his teachings based on heresay and rumor.

Having studied Toltec teachings for many years I was shocked at the poor research done on this documentary.

If you are a student of Castaneda this will leave a very bad taste in your mouth.

The makers of this film showed total irresponsiblity in not verifying the information being presented.",1135814400,3,513,4.930232558139535
2390601,1,B000ARXG5E,"As the author of ""Filming Castaneda: The Hunt for Magic and Reason"" I was surprised and slightly amused to find my book linked to Ralph Torjan's film. Other than the use of Carlos Castaneda's name in the title there is no relationship between our projects. To clarify the misleading link for the unwitting reader: I was not involved in the making of this film. In fact, I chose not to participate in it, not as interviewee nor as supplier of the only video footage of the elusive writer.

Contrary to the implied relationship, my book deals with the actual secret filming of Carlos Castaneda and contains many supporting photographs selected from the seven hours of videotape I took together with my husband. It is the story of my personal experience spanning the last six years of Castaneda's life. During that time I had the privilege to see Castaneda from various perspectives. He was the autocratic teacher in his private classes, the hilariously funny and beguiling lecturer on stage, and the ordinary man living in Westwood.  For more details look up my website FilmingCastaneda.com.

After Castaneda's death I realized that the story together with the video material as well as our friendly access to Castaneda's widow and his adoptive son could make a great documentary. There was a tenuous attempt between Ralph Torjan and myself about a possible collaboration on a film that naturally would also include portions of the footage. I knew Ralph from a movement practice group and always liked him. Yet Ralph's strong vision of a ""sorceric"" project that was to be under his sole creative control did not leave any room for my ideas of a less biased and more entertaining documentary film. My intuition prompted me to decline any participation in his project. And considering the result I have no regrets.",1135728000,12,1810,4.927868852459016
2390602,2,B000ARXG5E,"Well, I have to say this DVD put a bad taste in my mouth right from the start.  This stupid DVD makes you watch a 3 minute movie preview before the real movie even starts.  You can't forward, rewind or skip it in any way, and I resent the utopian programmer who thought it was a good idea to force customers to watch a preview for another film.  It certainly doesn't make me want to go out and buy their other movie.  In fact, it makes me wish I never bought this one.  Stupid idea guys!",1135728000,4,487,4.03125
2390603,2,B000ARXG5E,"Not too good. The  poor production and distracting music and computer effects did not help. This thing went on and on, and more than once I wanted to turn it off. However having attended a good number of Carlos' classes I wanted to see if there was anything of significance (which there wasn't).

Basically interviews with people who had some contact with Carlos giving their personal opinions. Only one, Amy Wallace, had something interesting to say and I would have liked to have heard more from her. The rest were people who attended, tensegrity classes, either at seminars or the small classes, as well as others who did not. One of the interviewees, a Victor Sanchez claimed in his book to have met Don Juan and learned from him. But curiously this wasn't mentioned at all.

 Only 2 photos of Carlos and 2 very short soundbites. Overall the movie was quite weak. Barely a 2.",1134950400,4,879,4.651612903225806
2390604,5,B000ARXG5E,"I'm glad I got in here at the start before the hate mongers got in here and spread there negativity.  This film was a lot of fun.  I saw it at a film festival a few years back and everyone seemed to have a really good time.  Laughing, gasping, enjoying themselves.  And to me, that's the sign of a great movie.  If you're a fan of Castaneda, check it out! It won't disappoint!",1131926400,7,376,4.095890410958904
2390605,4,B000ARXG5E,"I'm not sure of its cinematic merits, but as a documet into Castaneda's theology, I'd have to say this documentary is insightful and merits a look from anyone seriously investigating Castaneda and trying to make sense of his legacy.  As an author who seemed to offer little to the public, I don't see how anyone serious about these books could pass up the opportunity to learn more about this elusive man.  There's so much B.S. out there about him being a cult leader, and while this documentary is critical of him at times, it's also very favorable.  I appreciated the approach that didn't skew with hatred or blind faith.  Sure, it left a whole lot unanswered, but it's not like Castaneda left a whole lot to go on.  I really liked it and think it actually creates something larger than itself.  More riddles to solve.  More to learn and discover.  I love the path with heart!",1131926400,11,878,4.583333333333333
2390606,3,B000ARXG5E,"Finally got around to watching the DVD of CARLOS CASTANEDA: Enigma of a Sorcerer - the film that was making the rounds for a brief time awhile back, but never seemed to play in a theater near me. Overall, it was an interesting documentary, primarily interviews with some of Castaneda's so-called ""inner circle"" - including but not limited to Amy Wallace, Corey Donovan (Sustained Action), ""Felix"", and some others. Also interviewed were Daniel Noel (Seeing Castaneda) and Richard DeMille (The Don Juan Papers). The music was memorable, and though there obviously wasn't much of a budget for location shooting, it seemed the film makers did a decent job with the resources available. With that said, it's not necessarily the direction I would have taken such a film - frankly the opinions of clearly disgruntled ex-followers should be taken with a large mound of salt - but at least those interviewed seemed to be sincere in their beliefs about Carlos.

Okay, it's no secret that I have always thought of deMille as a rather uninspired academician, and that opinion has not changed as a result of viewing this film. For someone who has essentially devoted a large part of his life to debunking Castaneda, all he has really come up with is that the dates cited in CC's books don't always coincide when he could have REALLY been in Mexico. That, and some dry observations about how Castaneda's books always seemed to come out shortly AFTER, and seemingly ECHO things written in other texts about shamanism. Ho hum. Trying to debunk the mystical with stale academic logic is rather like trying to stop the sun in its path with a wand.

If shamanism is a real thing, it stands to reason a lot of shamans are going to come to the same conclusions, as a result of the same experiences, at around the same point in time. I once was in the process of writing a science fiction story, only to have it appear in print about 5 minutes after I finished my first draft. The plot was virtually identical. The characters were virtually interchangeable from her story to mine. Did the other writer plagiarize me? Did I plagiarize her? Of course not. Sometimes a synchronicity really is just a synchronicity. Things may be ""in the air"" (which is a viable possibility in a quantum universe). Or we may all be Dreaming the same strange Dream, occasionally exchanging ideas and information in the outer limits of the twilight zone.

And yet, despite deMille, the film was quite enlightening and discussed some things I hadn't known before. I do find it ironic, however, that so many of the inner circle really and CLEARLY do not ""get it"" and never did. I was HIGHLY impressed with ""Felix"", but other than that, so many of them seemed to be lost followers who were now trying to rebuild the world CC shattered for them - a shattering that could have been a grand gift, but appeared to most of the interviewees to have been a great burden instead. Rather like Cypher, they just wanted to go back to the matrix, when the world made sense and could be shoved into neat little categories. And, of course, Carlos's primary goal seemed to be exactly the opposite - tear down the walls of the matrix and *see* the world for what it is.

I found this especially true of Corey's comments at certain points - though he made a valiant attempt to present himself as an unbiased commentator (and did a fairly good job of it most of the time), it was easy to see he is still hurting from, and forever changed by, whatever idea he was attached to that never manifested. In wanting Carlos to be all things, it became necessary for him & others to whittle ""the man"" down to ""just a man"". In other words - let's debunk the messenger so we don't have to consider the dire consequences of the message itself. And for anyone who has read Castaneda and actually understood it, those consequences are dire indeed. We are beings who are going to die and be forever lost to the universe and to ourselves unless we are successful in creating the sorcerer's double and inhabiting the assemblage point of the totality of ourselves.

My main complaint with this film was that it did nothing to really discuss the teachings of Castaneda - and focused more on ""the man"" and his shortcomings as a human being. That's unfortunate, since any one of Castaneda's books would be worthy of its own documentary.

Having read the Sustained Action website a few years ago, (and having been labeled a ""true believer"" and summarily dismissed because of failure to to agree that Carlos was a dangerous charlatan), I also still feel that a lot of the folks who were members of that inner circle were ""followers"" - and that alone explains their disappointment and disillusionment. The entirety of the Toltec teachings is about not following gurus, but learning instead to create our own foundation based wholly on experience - for it is only experience that may be processed into Knowledge. Warriors take the lessons we may gather from our Toltec teachers, but we recognize that the teachers themselves - yes, even so-called Naguals - are first and foremost human beings who are going to die.

And yet... one of the primary arguments for Carlos being a charlatan has always been that he seemingly did not ""burn with the fire from within"". While this was not specifically discussed in the film, it was a major issue with some of the folks at Sustained Action, and probably still is. And so, while the film spoke at length about how we are ""beings who are going to die,"" it seemed oddly ironic that the man who wrote those words was expected to be a being who would not die - at least not in the manner of a human being.

Despite the somewhat annoying graphics at times, the film seemed to present a view of some people with real heart - whatever their opinion of Carlos ended up being in the end. As I say, ""Felix"" was quite amazing in the depth of his understanding, and I wouldn't mind talking to him one on one at some point. Amy Wallace seemed quite sincere, but it was also seemed to me that even if she might have been on a Toltec path at some point, her alignment and her love was more for Carlos than for the path. And there was something very touching and very human about that.

Are the witches dead? Who's to say? Is Tensegrity based on a series of ancient movements handed down directly from don Juan, or is it just some modified karate kata? Does it matter?

What I found interesting was that several of those who were interviewed had come to somewhat the same conclusion I have re the persona of don Juan. At least 2 of them ventured to say they did not believe don Juan ever existed as an extant persona. None ever went so far as to say don Juan may have been Castaneda's double, which is my personal theory - though Daniel Noel came close at one point when commenting on what is ""real"" - and coming around to saying that Don Juan is certainly real now. He has the power to change lives, after all, ad something ""unreal"" would have no such ability.

We have made don Juan real - by giving him our power and our attention and our love. Maybe that's what Carlos intended all along - for it is my contention that he had to actually BE a wily sorcerer in order to write ABOUT wily sorcerers in the manner he did. The Eagle's Gift could not have been written by anyone other than ""don Juan"" himself - the intricacies are simply too precise to have been created by someone who had not experienced these things directly - something I could not have said until I also had those same experiences as a result of my Intent. Before that, I might also have felt it was fiction. Having been there, I now Know it is Truth.

So, while the film has certain drawbacks,I would recommend it to anyone on a spiritual path as a reminder to all of us that our gurus and even our teachers are all only humans with feet of clay... but that doesn't for a moment detract from their message if one has the courage and the Intent to see beyond the foibles of the human and into the heart of the nagual.",1383004800,6,8019,4.515151515151516
2390607,1,B000ARXG5E,"I was a huge fan of Carlos Casteneda in the 1970s, and I still am. It doesn't matter to me if academics and others debunked him, or whether Don  Juan was real or just a metaphor to express a spiritual teaching. What matters is only THE TEACHING, and I learned a lot from Carlos' books back in the day.

For this reason I was very interested in watching this movie, but it was so poorly written and directed that I had to turn it off after about 30 minutes. It seemed to be nothing more than a series of talking heads, which would have been bad enough, but to make it worse, each interview subject was backed by psychedelic imagery that was distracting and unnecessary. And the music was mixed way too loud.

Perhaps the film got better after the first 30 minutes. I would like to think that it included some historical research on Toltec history, shamanic spirituality and other relevant information, and maybe some nice visuals (other than those lame psychedelic images) but I couldn't watch it long enough to find out.",1374451200,5,1020,4.532608695652174
2390608,4,B000ARXG5E,Its put together scantily but still with some valid interviews from people who knew Carlos.  Glean what you will from their testimony and see deeper into the world of Castaneda.  Its worth a 2$ rent.,1370304000,,199,4.6571428571428575

2390610,5,B000ARXG5E,The Value of Shakespeare's Work Still Stands Whether He Existed Or Not.....so Don Juan was not real and Castenada was a pervert liar and con artist. His canon is still is a good read and this movie is a good start sifting through his ashes.,1345852800,,240,4.355555555555555
2390611,2,B000ARXG5E,"Journey to Ixtlan was a life changing book for me. But I was only about 1/3 of the way through before I realized that this was a modern myth or perhaps a philosophical dialogue in the style of Plato and Socrates. The events and characters were not factual, but were true nevertheless. I think many of us Castaneda fans made of  Don Juan an icon such as Superman - one whom does not manifest in reality, but does exist as a shadow in our subconscious and a dramatic character in the culture. And some of us made Don Juan's creator a savior, one to whom if we surrendered our will and offered our devotion, we would receive salvation from our very human natures and indeed enlightenment. But alas, our little Carlitos was just a human being after all, just like us except for his literary genius. Enlightenment can neither be purchased  with money nor soul. It's not commerce. And our drive to be different and somehow better than our brothers and sisters certainly seems to walking in the wrong direction down the path with heart.

Anyway, I was delighted to find this movie, but disappointed with it's execution. It was another of the spiritual talking heads documentaries with ambient music being played behind. But this one was worse than most because of the psychedelic and distracting color explosions and distortions of the very scant actual images. This could have been a better audio presentation. If you are new to the controversy surrounding Castaneda's books, there is much to learn here. I was hoping however for a compelling piece of art that touches deep and inspires an opening to expanding consciousness in much the same way that Carlos did it himself . . . but then, that was his genius of which I mentioned; the reason why we even care about all of this. The movie which captures a bit of the richness of Carlos' ideas and the convoluted twist of his personality still remains to be made.",1337385600,3,1905,4.646884272997033
2390612,1,B000ARXG5E,"This is my first review in 12 years.  Instead of getting usable info about Castenada's beliefs or instruction, we see (literally) a background of bizarre, colored shapes (remember being on acid, checking out the lava lamps?)with a foreground of cheap, tabloid-style interviews of former Castaneda students. They aren't asked if they benefitted from the work, but how they felt about Castaneda's personal life. Was he a con man? Even this gossipy question, if answered, might deserve one star, but the editors chop up the responses into into 30-second, out of context, sound bites so you never get clear idea of what these folks are saying. Can you spell rip-off?",1282089600,5,662,5.073394495412844
2390613,1,B000ARXG5E,"I would have given this DVD zero stars if the web page would accept it. The production values of this video are abysmal and irritating! The music is worse. Cheesy ""psychedelic"" effects and poorly presented fragments of interviews. Irritating attempts at hypnotizing the user with trite effects and ineffective paradoxes. The film seems to lose its identity as a documentary and at points dissolves into cheesy 1950's style stage hypnotism.

Castaneda was a phenomenally gifted writer, an entertainer who was an inspiration to a generation. Whether or not his scholarship is valid or his anthropology fictitious he captured for a generation the adventure of discovering another culture with advanced pharmacognosy, philosophy and psychology. He blew the cowboy and Indian mentality of middle America completely away and initiated an era of respect for native wisdom.

This gaudy and tasteless production collects a number of disenchanted followers, detractors and pseudo academics and presents a jumble of their criticisms and complaints. There is an almost sadistic approach taken toward the viewer. A kind of media challenge: ""Can you bear to listen and watch the mountains of audio drivel and visual TV cliches in order to glean some knowledge about this intriguing individual?"" The signal to noise ratio of this work is enough to deter the most sincere audience.

Castaneda remains a fascinating figure, gifted writer who was able to enjoy best selling status without the gruelling and grovelling of print media interviews or radio & television spots. Apparently he disintegrated toward the end, but certainly works like this one obscure whoever he was even better than he did. There is plenty of room for a neutral documentary that presents all sides of the phenomenon of Castaneda and what it degenerated into toward the end of his life!

Save your money, don't purchase such a trashy presentation of such an interesting and influential figure.",1274486400,,1949,5.27741935483871
2390614,3,B000ARXG5E,"This video is about 90 minutes long, most of which was probably done with a 90's home PC.  There are a lot of visual backgrounds dropped into the interviews and the narration.  So much so that it takes away from the movie.  I understand that they probably did this to try to create some ""trippyness"" aspect since the video is of Castaneda's life, however this part of the video is a ""strike out"".  It borders on the obnoxious and almost induces headache.

The story on the other hand is definitely interesting.  It is a series of dialogue with followers who were close to Castaneda during his peak as a teacher. There were definite things I did not know about him such as his womanizing and self deprecating rants as one of the interviewed had described him to do from time to time. I see some of the other reviews here feel that this lessens his overall body of work... I do not.  I feel his teachings will last many years past representations such as this.  This video puts him in more of a human context, rather than a mystical all seeing shaman with no personal faults.

Personally I would have preferred a rendition of this video with more on his teachings(as this video has very little of this), rather than the overview of his personal life shown here.

Overall I would not recommend purchasing this video, but rather rent it first to see if you want to spend the money. 3 Stars based on what I felt was interesting information about his life, but you will still have to endure the bad production and the annoying light show.

2390616,4,B000ARXG5E,"This was interesting.  I had read and been intrigued by the first 2 or 3 books of Carlos Castandeda's but since, hadn't ""kept in touch"".  A few years ago I was talking to a woman from LA who mentioned things that this DVD discusses and explores and I was surprised, but not surprised.  I thought the film was well produced (I had done a google search for Pamela Weir-Quiton because I had gone to the beginning of art school with her and was thinking about her and wondered what she was doing now, hence I found the DVD CARLOS CASTANEDA ENIGMA OF A SORCERER)  Well done.  Not so sure about the DVD cover slip design or some of the music but the content and production itself-- very good.

2390617,3,B000ARXG5E,"I'm writing this review because I don't think this video entirely deserves to be bashed like it is on these pages. Yeah, the production is a little cheesy, but that doesn't mean that the content isn't any good. It's nice to see the people who are skeptical of Castaneda stumble with their weak arguments. It's also nice to see the insights of the people that actually learned from Castaneda personally, and how that relationship reinforces the idea that the meaning is in the message, not the man or the medium. Trippy special effects are supplied by G-Force, not iTunes as one reviewer claimed, and while not the most original graphics, they do provide a nice obscure backdrop to the ideas that Castaneda expresses. I used to sit and listen to techno/trance music on Winamp while watching this program draw images on the computer screen, and found it soothing. I will caution that for those who haven't read Castaneda, this DVD could do a disservice to the message and vision that the books contain as the impression one could get from the DVD is that Castaneda was merely a second-rate cult leader. In fact, I think the true paradox here is that in writing a collection of books that reached so many people, Castaneda found himself at the center of attention of people looking for a 'leader'. This runs contrary to the teachings of don Juan, in which the teacher merely shows one the way, at which point the student must then lead themselves and not expect a 'leader' to emerge or even lead them in any particular direction. Sorry Amazon, but I would recommend a rental for this one, as it's not up to par to add to most collections, even for those devoutly into Castaneda. But, if one wants to know what happened to Cleargreen and why there isn't more commercialization around Castaneda's work, this DVD will offer answers for those questions and even provide a little insight into the small community that gathered around this visionary writer.",1184198400,2,1948,4.7492625368731565

Most of the background graphics are actually generated by the iTunes default music visualizer.  It is surprising that such a low quality product ever saw any distribution.  It is an insult to the memory of a fascinating and compelling author and character.  I rented it and will demand my money back. An annoying waste of time.",1176768000,5,470,5.144736842105263
2390619,1,B000ARXG5E,"This film seems to come from the mind of one man, who's name I (thankfully for him) forget. This ""auteur"" was evidently responsible for the relentless barrage of corny home video effects and endless electronica that passes itself off as a soundtrack in this embarassingly amateurish attempt at a documentary on the life and teachings of Carlos Castaneda.

It's too bad, because Castaneda is a superb subject for a documentary treatment. This just isn't it. Comprised of interviews with a number of ex-students, Castaneda, who refused to be photographed (there are only a few known photos of the man,) never appears on screen. We only hear his voice for a moment at the beginning and end of the film.

It's almost tragic that this piece is for all intents and purposes unwatchable , as one can sense there was some good material to work with here. Some of the people who knew Castaneda offer up fascinating insights into the life of this complex self made guru. A couple of  ex-disciples are able to appreciate the value of the teachings of Don Juan, while at the same time acknowledging the whole affair was an elaborate hoax. This is the paradox of Castaneda, writer extraordinaire, trickster and charismatic myth maker.

But even the most candid reminisces and the most profound observations are wasted as we are relentlessly assaulted with a constant onslaught of mindless cliches in the form of puerile wipes and  fades, not to mention painfully literal composite shots, all saturated with one corny 70's ""psychedelic"" video effect after another. It's an exhausting experience if you can make it all the way through this turkey.  Just getting through the protracted credits is a chore.  If there is such a thing as ""eye candy"", this must be the equivalant of eye diarrhea.

 Be afraid. Be very afraid.",1151452800,32,1805,4.891803278688524
2390620,1,B000ARXG5E,"This documentary is a travesty, especially considering this is the only one available on Castaneda, because by being the only one it may be the *definitive* one.  Someone needs to make another Castaneda documentary just to set things right in some measure and do the man and his work justice.

First, when you put the DVD in, it forces you to watch a really old, bad looking documentary on corn (the sneak previews look even worse).  In the first few minutes of the doc you get assailed by shifting, swirling, distorting images of the interviewees.  It must be stressed how utterly cheap and amateurish the visual production of this movie is.  It seems the guy did dig deep into his Windows 95 bag of screensaver/desktop theme tricks along with his early 80s commodore 64 sprite programs to come up with such a crappy look to the film.  The film would have looked better with none of these visuals at all and probably would have cost the same to do so.  It's not that I focus on the quality of visuals in movies, but you just can't help but notice how cheap this DVD's visuals are and how often they distract you from the interviews.

My main critique of this documentary is it deals almost exclusively with the man's life outside his writings and not with the all-important writings themselves.  To achieve the documentary's aim would apparently be an enourmous feat to begin with since he led an ultra secretive life for many if not most of his years since his initial meeting with Don Juan.  You'd have to have direct access to his inner circle of followers, women, friends etc, none of which this documentary has except with Amy Wallace.  But she is only given equal time with everyone else, and what she has to say is (unfortunately) on par with everyone else.  That is, an almost worthless musing about Castaneda.  The most interesting thing I've heard Wallace say (not in this documentary) is the Don Juan character is actually a composite figure of several sorts of similar men Castaneda met throughout his life.  While this is a fascinating theory, she never offers a shred of evidence for it here.  Surely an anecdote of a Casteneda ecounter with another shaman would have been not only sound evidence but a great story in itself?

I was in a doctor's office recently with a copy of Taisha Abelar's ""The Sorcerer's Crossing"".  A nurse struck up a conversation with me about it and I mentioned Castaneda.  She said, ""I heard that his writings actually weren't true"".  I think what gives rise to such vacant rumours are chatty documentaries like this.  There are a couple of wormy, smug academics in the video who give explanations about why the Casteneda books aren't true.  For instance, one critic says Don Juan is moody and aloof in the first book, yet gets happier and more open into the second and third books.  To him, this clearly demonstrates a totally inconsistent personality and therefore indicates a fictitious character.  You just want to reach into the TV and slap this petty little monkey.  His arguments are so hollow, it's amazing they are even admitted into this documentary, especially without counterpoint.

When I first sat down to read Castaneda's first book ""The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way Of Knowledge"", I was so riveted that I read on continuously for 6 hours to about page 162 before sleep compelled me to stop.  That's about the best way I could describe how fascinating and awe inspiring the Castaneda books are.  Within a year I had read his first 7 books.  I've always felt that for me to try and describe Castaneda's books to someone asking would be an injustice because the books cover so much ground about the fascinating and nearly unbelievable latent powers all humans have that to try that to try encapsulate this would be futile.

At the end of the day, you realize that it's the Don Juan character and his teachings that's truly important about Castaneda's work - not Castaneda's sorcery abilities or that of any of his followers because they all seem to be light years behind Don Juan.  So focus on the Castaneda books and forget this piece of [...] `documentary'.",1147996800,61,4120,4.705718270571827
2390621,1,B000ARXG5E,"I bought this movie because I was interested in hearing a real interview with Castaneda and was lead to believe this DVD was a study of his work, perhaps from an anthropological perspective. Of course I expected some editorial on the relevance of his series, but what I got disgusted me.

First of all, the production value was TERRIBLE (read: flying panes of interviewees in psychedelic moving colors and cheesy windows 95 screensaver backgrounds - I could do a better job in my sleep and I don't even do video editing).

More importantly, this is an obvious grab for money and attention from those that have built their careers or lives on criticizing Castaneda's work. They throw around allegations of his making it up and ""doing it for the money"" / ""doing it for the women"". Who knew walking around in the desert, doing peyote with a Yaki Indian, and dedicating your life to writing accounts of your experiences got you women? Seems like a sort of lofty and difficult means to achieve the same end as maybe, oh I dunno, buying a Porsche.

People take the bible word for word as truth and that is perfectly acceptable to society despite ALL of the inconsistencies in the bible. After finishing the Castaneda collection, go back to the earlier work and be amazed at the consistency that is kept throughout. That alone speaks volumes of truth in the experience he had.

The only actual attempt at throwing out a factual reason why this experience was impossible, (as an biased majority allege) was made by an interviewee whose name I couldn't read due to all the patronizing ""trip"" effects, that Castaneda never received any mosquito bites while wondering the desert and therefore must have fabricated the whole anthropological study that had a strong forward by UCLA. OOKKKAAAYYYY.... Maybe he didn't write about it, maybe he was wearing deet, what the heck does that matter?

I could go on forever, but the bottom line is that no one, weather they value Castaneda's work or detest it, would consider this anything but a ploy for dollars and attention by people with little scholarly credit - at least in their presentation - if any. But if you look at it just the right way... it just proves Don Juan all the more correct. However only he could find a way to glen anything to learn from these petty tyrants and panderers to ""specialness"".",1140566400,26,2341,4.727941176470588
2390622,1,B000ARXG5E,"This movie is total crap.  I have been to Tensegrity Workshops and listened to Carlos in person.  I was hoping for more incite on what went on behind the scenes.  No, I was not part of the ""elite"" group.  What you get is someone's poor attempt to ""cash"" in on the Don Juan $$$$ wave.  Watch the free clips at [...] and you will basically get the whole movie for free.  Very disappointing and if you see a rating higher than 1 star (generous) it is because they somehow are profiting by you buying the video (I'll sell you my copy).",1140307200,22,531,4.207920792079208

Probably due to the fact that my expectations were set so low, I actually did not mind seeing this.  This DVD is a about a group of individuals who attended Castaneda's workshops/Sunday Sessions trying to make sense of his teachings after his passing.  I found it interesting to hear their perspectives and yes I did hate the special effects.  If you are a hard core Castaneda fan, you will enjoy hearing the famed man's voice.",1139875200,16,658,4.646551724137931

2390625,3,B000ARXG5E,"I think some of the reviewers have missed the point of the documentary. The documentary doesn't debunk Castaneda, it simply points out that some of his followers became too dependent upon him. I've read his books and his entire point is to find yourself and free your mind, but some Castaneda followers simply turned him into their guru and stopped being anything. Now if you're looking for great insight into his philosophy or how to practice his ideas then this documentary will disappoint, if you're looking for a documentary that shows you the type of people who become followers -- think Jonestown, Koresh, etc. then this film is interesting.",1136937600,11,647,4.944954128440367
