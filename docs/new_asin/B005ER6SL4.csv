4666997,5,B005ER6SL4,"Insightful interviews that make you feel like you're just observing a casual conversation ... I just bought these for the unique performances, and I was most certainly not disappointed.",1331424000,2,185,5.413793103448276
4666998,5,B005ER6SL4,Great product at a great price!  I've always loved Elvis Costello and this program features him playing with a variety of other artists and his own house band.  Great stuff!!!,1327363200,,175,4.8
4666999,3,B005ER6SL4,"We really enjoyed the series.  The second season is particularly good.  Unfortunately, we had a problem with the second disc of the second season.  We returned for a new copy to Amazon and had the same problem.  It is possible to get the bad disc to play sometimes on a particular computer, but the disc is missing some key information and it seems like a product problem.",1326758400,3,372,4.507462686567164
8468845,5,B005ER6SL4,"I had never heard of this series before reading the autobiography recently released by Elvis Costello.  This is a wonderful find! 45 minute interviews with the likes of Sir Elton John, Smoky Robinson, Tony Bennett, The Police, Bill Clinton, and that was only season 1!  Where was I in 2008 when these were on the Sundance channel?  A jewel of a find.  Music with every episode. I can't wait to watch the rest of them, but I am savoring them and trying not to watch them all at once.",1457913600,,482,4.382022471910112
8468846,2,B005ER6SL4,"The show itself is great. The DVD case is the most poorly designed piece of junk I've encountered in a while. They tried to jam 5 DVDs in there and it just doesn't work. The plastic tabs that hold them in were snapped and one disc was unwatchable. I ordered another set and the same problem with another disc, this time disc 5. The disc is playable but scratched. It plays on my main dvd player but not my portable one. If they didn't cheap out on the case I'd give it 5 stars.",1456704000,,477,4.085106382978723
8468847,5,B005ER6SL4,"great show, canceled too soon. See Elton  w/ Ms. Costello, Zoe Deshanel in the shortest dress you could imagine, Sting being the jerk that is Sting, etc. Always charming, Elvis squeezes in many of his best songs.",1429574400,2,212,4.72972972972973
8468848,5,B005ER6SL4,Elvis isn't the best interviewer but the guests and the performances are outstanding.,1424822400,,85,5.615384615384615
8468849,5,B005ER6SL4,"Great interviews with Bill Clinton, Lou Reed and Bruce Springsteen and others.",1423180800,,78,5.583333333333333
8468850,5,B005ER6SL4,"A fantastic journey of musical history and heartfelt emotion of so many outstanding guest performers.  Elvis Costello has an incredible depth of musical knowledge and he does an excellent job interviewing his guests while getting them to share the stories behind their works.  Some episodes will truly move you.  It's very much worth owning and watching many times.  I only wish he would've continued the series because I would watch him collaborate with many other artists that would've fit outstandingly into this style of interaction.
Keep in mind this is not a series about Elvis Costello's music, although he does perform some of his own material with the guests.
After watching the series it actually caused me to buy some of the guest artists older material that I never really knew before, and now have such a deep appreciation for many of these older works of musical brilliance.",1420156800,,888,4.97972972972973
8468851,4,B005ER6SL4,"I love this series.  I had to deduct one star because unfortunately the box for the 1st season was so poorly executed, it's very flimsy and starts to come apart.  The content, however, is very much 5 star!",1399852800,,205,4.368421052631579
8468852,4,B005ER6SL4,"I suspect that Elvis Costello would not be on a lot of lists of the most likely pop musicians of the past 30 or 40 years to host a music-based talk show.  Go beneath the surface, though, and Costello perhaps is some ways the best-equipped musician to do just that.  Costello is walking encyclopedia of pop music, very knowledgeable about jazz, and an surprisingly good conversationalist.  So, the image of the punk rocker who was banned from NBC's Saturday Night Live for many years for stopping his band, the Attractions, mid-song and launching into another song, which happened to be an indictment of commercial radio broadcasting, doesn't actually represent the Elvis Costello of the twenty-first century.  Spectacle finds Costello performing live with his then-current band, performing duets with guests, and chatting with his guests about their work, the importance of music in their lives, and the importance of music in culture.  In fact, one of the unexpected things, especially in season 1, is the number of times that Costello and his guests talk about the importance of the arts in education.  Guests include Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Tony Bennett, Roseann Cash, Diana Krall (Elton John actually interviews Ms. Krall, who is also Mrs. Costello), Herbie Hancock, Bill Clinton, and others.  Although the conversations are not always entirely as free-flowing as they might be, and although the video editing for DVD is not as smooth as it could be, this unusually structured program is a gem that deserves to be better known.",1398384000,2,1538,5.103585657370518
