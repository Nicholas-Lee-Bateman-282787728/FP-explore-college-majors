8007618,5,B000189KRA,"This movie highlights the harsh realities of peer pressure, experimentation with drugs, and eventual drug addiction. Jonathan Jackson (Max), accurately and poignantly depicts a typical teenager who seems to have everything going for him until he feels the pressures of living up to his parents expectations, living up to his own expectations of himself and eventually meets a girl who is already in deep with drugs. Since he likes this girl so much he does everything in his power to make her happy including supporting her drug habit. The two of them together go down a very dangerous road of partying, sharing needles, and constant drug use. Jonathan Jackson's performance is extremely powerful which will certainly make you sit up and think about the very real dangers of teenage drug use. This is an excellent movie to have your children watch as it exemplifies the realities of drug use and how it can affect a persons life. This is a great movie, don't miss it!",1260662400,,967,4.866666666666666
8007619,3,B000189KRA,"A very good video with Hayden Christensen in a supporting role. Though his part was not major to the film you could see he had ""something."" A must for Hayden fans.",1256083200,,163,4.290322580645161
8007620,5,B000189KRA,"I really enjoyed this movie. Not only for the well crafted plot and talented cast, but the message behind the film. This story is touching, realistic, and tragic. Jonathan Jackson is superb as the troubled son, JoeBeth Williams as the controlling, choleric mother. Fans of Hayden Christensen may be surprised to discover his small but tangible role in the film. This story deals with drug abuse and it's consequences. How one teenager's innocent attempt to fit in spirals out of control.  The scene where Mrs. Hanson (JB Williams) goes to lunch with some of her friends and spots her son Max (Jonathan Jackson) begging for drug money is very poignant. It opens her eyes to the fact that something is indeed wrong, and that parents need to listen to their kids.

 In all, touching story of a woman who tries to live through her son, destroying his dreams and nearly her entire family in the process.",1133913600,8,898,4.743589743589744
