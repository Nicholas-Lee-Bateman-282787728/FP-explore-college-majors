3147970,5,B0015XHQVC,"I've seen this when released and I would disagree with many of the reviewers who complain of the ""disjointed"" script.  This movie is not confusing.  It is extremely fast paced and can be watched several times to get all the jokes. The special effects are brutally effective and the underlying message very disturbing. The dark humor is right on, especially the bit where the Cusack's only friend is his Northstar roadside assistance system.  The only complaint of the movie is how they fit Hillary Duff into the movie.  It's a bit corny, but hey, it's Hollywood.",1223078400,21,562,4.822916666666667
3147971,5,B0015XHQVC,"As a fan of Cusack's since Gross Pointe Blank, I am glad to see him back as a kick-butting hit man. This time he's taken his comedic touch up a notch in my opinion, plus the message is so pertinent, that you just can't go wrong. Like most American's I too thought the war was a necessary move but due to mismanagement and bad leadership it has turned into an utter failure. Cusack uses this political satire to show audiences how we are exploiting the middle east and profiteering from this illegal war. A classic Cusack performance spliced wit hard-hitting political satire make this movie truly provocative, a controversial masterpiece.",1222560000,8,638,4.8090909090909095
3147972,5,B0015XHQVC,"I came upon this movie by accident while I was visiting friends in Colorado (because, naturally, such a film won't be shown in ultra-conservative Georgia). I immediately fell in love with the dark humor and political satire as my favorite actor battled against his conscience, his bosses, and his hot sauce addiction. This movie is a fun watch for all, but particularly relevant to those of us who oppose the war. John Cusack hits it out of the park by finally saying what everyone's been too afraid to say. ""War, Inc."" is a MUST SEE!",1221782400,13,534,4.631578947368421
3147973,5,B0015XHQVC,"War Inc has an all star cast that includes John Cusack as Hauser a troubled assassin who has accepted a job of bumping off the figure head of a rival nation.  To do this he must pose as a trade show coordinator hosting a Tamerlane Brand USA Expo in recently ""liberated"" country Turaqistan.  On top of all this and with the help of his assistant (Joan Cusack) he has to juggle a headstrong reporter (Marisa Tomei) and the impending wedding of pop superstar Yonika BabyYea (Hilary Duff).  War Inc is a film that will entertain a number of different audiences.  On the surface the film plays much like a guy with girl troubles film but its the underlying theme that really makes it shine.  Writers Mark Leyner, Jeremy Pikser and John Cusack weave a story that draws many parallels between what is happening on screen and in America today. One could easily view these larger than life characters as allegorical representations of the American Public, Capitalism, Big Business, Government, The Media...and so on.  There is of course a good bit of the absurd, including but not limited to: fighting, licking and hotsauce drinking. Overall this film is ahead of its time for its candid statements about the geo political climate and its fun enough that you can still eat popcorn too. I hope you enjoy!",1218758400,23,1294,4.728888888888889
3147974,5,B0015XHQVC,"I almost skipped this one as a political annoyance until I saw the star power supporting it: Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei (a personal favorite), John Cusack, Joan Cusack, and more. That cast simply won't let a movie be bad. They couldn't if they tried.

Despite an apparent attempt to be ordinary entertainment, this one rises above all the usual categories. Do you want a cynical mockumentary of Haliburton-style war profiteering? Got it. Do you want pointed jabs at operations funded by Congress's ""black budget?"" Check. Do you want satirical assaults on simplistic sloganeering from every possible direction? It's there. Add in a babe like a pre-meltdown Britney but with hotter hotpants and a bucket of slapstick, and you're headed in the right direction. For example, a major character's name is ""Uckmee Fay."" Speakers of pig-Latin, please take note.

They set the tone from the very first scene. Chevy Chase delivers a ""Mission Impossible"" style of assignment to a high-class assassin, via video, while seated on American Standard's finest. Later, Joan Cusack shows up in the role that she has perfected - the prim, cheery, and murderous psychopath. There's a lot more, too. I laughed all through, even (maybe especially) when I knew that outrage would have been the ""appropriate"" response.

This one really grows on me the more I think about it. It doesn't whap you upside the head with humor, politics, or even its sappy moments. Instead, it tickles you with not-quite-too-much of social commentary, current events, goofy jokes, visual gags, and enough more to hold it all together. I liked it more a few hours later than when I walked out the door, and lots of movies have the opposite effect on me.

3148065,4,B0015XHQVC,"I give the 2008 satire WAR, INC. 3-1/2 stars, and since Amazon does not offer half-star distinctions, round it off to 4. The film's plot devices overwhelm it as it ends, but up until then leading man John Cusack is in top form, not surprising in a thinking person's satire.

Along with Cusack,  Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff stand out but it is Ben Kingsley who gives us WAR INC.'s most noteworthy performance. I'm guessing Kingsley's character was at one point a bigger part of the story but lost out to either keeping the movie under two hours or to give more time to the relationship of Cusack and Tomei.  Kingsley's scenes are as good as any, and were WAR, INC. to play up the tension between Cusack and him, it might be even better.",1427846400,,737,4.444444444444445

I have always loved his movies, maybe it's because we are a month apart from being twins, or that we have the same satirical view on life(or maybe just his screen persona) irregardless I identify.  Being an ex- Navy service member stationed in the desert supporting USMC for 8 yrs, I take a little offense that the last service member should comment on Cusak's tendencies. After all, that's what service and ex-service members did and do, keep the American freedom and right to hold those opinions. Sadly the military, the very instrument to supposedly ensure these rights are secure, hold it's member as antagonists if they speak up or disagree, and hold others as opponents if they do not have a high regard for the military machine.

On this subject, what could have been a great movie with well-respected actors was not.  For me the movie was not only banal, it was just plain stupid.  Maybe the movie really wanted to be a comedy, but it failed at that also.  I don't know why the actors took this job.  I guess they saw something promising, but as far as I am concerned, whatever was promising never materialized.

Another fifteen minutes went by and we both were ready to puke just as Mr Cusack does in one scene.  We gave up and shut down the movie.

Most of the 1-star reviews though seem to be from people who were genuinely shocked about the lopsided politicism. I'm shocked that they're shocked. Unfortunately we have bands of political warriors on this site (of both political persuasions) that troll books, films, and even products they don't like but have never tried. The other 1-stars seem to be from people who just can't get over that this isn't another version of Grosse Pointe Blank. It's not - can the GPB fans move on with their lives now?

So ignore the 5 stars and 1 stars on this one and just watch for yourself.

Back to the movie - yes, it's a bit stupid at points - maybe even a lot stupid. It's supposed to be.

That being said, the characters are enjoyable and have surprising chemistry. We also discover Hilary Duff should play women from other countries for the rest of her career, because the overacting she grew up doing in Disney productions fits perfectly here. That comes off as a knock, but I actually mean this well. Cusack's inherent neuroticism was harnessed well, and Tomei fit in well as the love interest and added her usual sass. Nice cameos involved - I won't spoil the surprises.

I'm not sure how it happened, but this silly little flick actually sucked me in to where I forgot about time & what was going on around me. Not saying it will change your life, but hey, it's free (for prime members) & I bet War, Inc. will at least make you smile.",1377820800,,1614,4.476190476190476

3148266,2,B0015XHQVC,"Every time I see a review of this film comparing it to George Armitage's brilliant GROSSE POINTE BLANK, I get a little angry. Other than the fact that Cusack's character plays a corporate assassin whose ability to kill his target is hampered by a love interest, this is nothing like GROSSE POINTE BLANK. WAR, INC. is a very targeted satire against companies like Haliburton and Blackwater and other privatized armed forces that seems to lose its way amongst a mire of sleepy performances, mostly uninteresting dialogue, and a scattered mix of comedy, romance, action and satire that never seems to gel together.

Cusack, who co-wrote the film, obviously has his heart in the right place as companies like Blackwater and Haliburton seemed to be on the verge of running the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they were prime targets for some good satire. Sadly, that satire doesn't present itself other in some very obvious ways. The only performers who seem to be on their game here are the Cusacks (both John and Joan) and, oddly enough, Hilary Duff, who makes a pretty good case as someone to be treated seriously. Kingsley's casting is inspired, but you get the sense that not even he knows what his character's motivations are. Kingsley is one of the world's greatest living actors and after a brilliant and sadly-underrated performance in John Dahl's 2007 hit-man comedy YOU KILL ME, he still remains somewhat obscure.

The film's plot becomes increasingly convoluted and the film's climax is very forgettable, but the very end of the film is something I remember keenly, not because it was so effective, but because it was so incredibly bizarre.

A completely privatized war, with the strings pulled by the CIA and managed by a remorseful operator.

Not even the talents of Hilary Duff, Ben Kingsley, and Marisa Tomei (generally very good) could save this from mediocrity.  To be fair, Ms Duff dealt with a subtle and complex role very well.  She was cast as a pop starlette from Central Asia, who was looking for a way out of an awful third world country, with a few extra secrets. Ms Tomei played an idealistic journalist who falls for the operator and still wants to unveil corporate and political corruption.  Kingsley does well as the puppet master, managing the fall and rise of kingdoms and pulling our hero's strings.

[Blu-ray</a>] to some extent. This falling under comedy, the makers faced less pressure for 'balance' and, once the location is set to the fantasy and idyllic land of Turaqistan most inhibitions are off and we can watch the likes of John Cusack, Hilary Duff, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley operate in a space where freedom and democracy are being delivered to a grateful country by means of sustained bombing followed by reconstruction and government-financed private enterprise.

I am not going to reveal the plot because most of it can be sourced to news stories by simply changing Turakistan and Ugigistan to some real-world country names. A lot of the comic effect is the process of recognizing 'that scene' as being inspired by 'that real-life event' or 'that actor/character' being the too close for comfort caricature of 'that politician or personality'. It's fun and it's a recommended watch for both those who consider themselves 'well informed' and the occasional viewers/readers of mainstream media productions delivered to us as 'the news'. In the end, the plot as thin and chaotic as any story attempting to portray 'what is' rather than 'what happens' or 'what happened' it's a movie worth watching. I was quite impressed by John Cusack's performance as the assassin with a conscience, Hilary Duff brilliant impersonation of a Middle-East rock star, Joan Cusack as the hysterical and murderous public relations and interrogation expert. It's all done with enthusiasm and talent and it's too bad the movie had such a limited release back in 2008. But that can be partially remedied by watching the movie today and learning and having some fun in the process.

I am going to grant this one 4 stars (most professional critics didn't like it at all) because some of the scenes in the middle aren't as brilliantly executed as those at the opening and the end (I'm not talking about the credits) but it's a great and a 'different' movie to watch and you can do it for free before you buy with Amazon's Prime or Netflix.",1333929600,,3037,6.027777777777778

3148282,3,B0015XHQVC,"As the title suggests, ""War, Inc."" is a satire about the ""business"" that is war, in particular the American propensity for bombing a Middle Eastern country to smithereens (i.e., Iraq and Afghanistan), then exploiting it for everything it's worth - all in the name of ""democracy."" In this particular case, it is the fictional nation of Turaqistan, which the U.S. has recently invaded and where it is now contracting out all its security and reconstruction services to a private corporation called Tamerlane, modeled, none too subtly, on Halliburton and KBR.

John Cusack stars as Brand Hauser, a covert operator working under the auspices of the former vice-president of the United States (Dan Akroyd), whose mission is to take out the CEO of an oil company at a gala wedding reception that Brand himself is supposed to organize. While in the ""safe zone"" - known in common parlance as the Emerald City - Brand meets his high-strung assistant (played by Cusack's real-life sister Joan), the promiscuous celebrity bride (the typecast Hilary Duff), a fellow hit man (Ben Kingsley) who has some personal issues with Brand, and Natalie Hegalhuzen (Marisa Tomei), a liberal reporter from the Nation, who is there to expose the multinational skullduggery and corruption taking place in the country - or as she affectionately calls it ""a democracy on the march land-grab.""

Written by Cusack, Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser and directed by Joshua Seftel, ""War, Inc."" is a largely hit-and-miss affair, with moments of insight and humor alternating with moments of silliness and juvenalia. And as with many films of this type, its air of knowingness occasionally slips over into smugness. Yet, though it feels kind of slapdash and doughy at times, the movie ultimately achieves that artful mixture of the serious and the trivial that is the essence of absurdity. And the Ennio Morricone-flavored score by David Robbins gives the movie the flip, hip air it needs to be effective.

As a satire it will not give Jonathan Swift any competition. Its so broadly overdone as to be a satire of itself. It portrays a completely privitized military, reporters whose stories are based upon virtual reality rides, an inane and completely pointless subplot involving John Cusack, his boss and one of the other stars, what appear to be mental patients wandering through a free fire zone and similar bizaare scenes.

3148288,4,B0015XHQVC,"""War, Inc."" does indeed follow in the steps of ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" but it is quite different.

The satire here is broader and at the same time more focused.  In ""Gross Pointe,"" the targets were Gen-X anomie and individual angst.

Here the targets are political and social: pre-emptive war, the privatization of everything, the selling of everything (happiness, sex, youth, glamor, death), corporatization, the emptiness of celebrity-culture.

This movie doesn't have the energy and snap of ""Grosse Pointe.""  Cusack is jowly and tired.  But ""War, Inc."" makes a virtue of that very tiredness by making Hauser/Cusack's disenchantment more believable.

There are lots of nice touches.

Ben Kingsley is amazing as the Southern-fried CIA psychopath.  (Kingsley tries to strike it rich with a Roman Empire Themepark, complete with His and Hers Vomitoriums.  It fails in the Real Estate collapse, but the parallel between decadent Rome and equally-decadent U.S.A. is clear.)

Ackroyd does a brief, crude, but spot-on slam at Cheney.

Joan Cusack has turned into a zoned-out control-freak corporate harpy, perfect for the role.

Marisa Tomei is mostly OK as the crusading, frustrated reporter.  (She does have a little trouble keeping a straight face.)

But--amazing!--best of all is Hillary Duff.

3148289,1,B0015XHQVC,"My wife and I have loved almost everything John Cusack has ever done.  On the strength of that alone we will watch his stuff when it comes out.  But given the star power in this movie it was a must see.

The advertising made it sound as though Cusack was reprising his role from Grosse Pointe Blank as the introspective, edgy hitman looking to bring sense into his chaotic life and restore his karma to balance.  Throughout the movie (which took three sittings to get all the way through) I kept waiting for some bit of Martin Blank to resurface.  When that seemed to much to hope for I waited for the funny part to begin, which I was sure Cusack would deliver.  When that failed to appear I began to wait for the part where the plot would move along to some engaging point that would keep me entertained through the remainder of the film. It never came.

I know Cusack has some very typical Hollywood left leanings, that's fine.  I know it is popular in Hollywood to bash the military.  Fine, that's your right to do so.  But others have done it in ways that were entertaining and worthwhile.  Kubrick's classic Full Metal Jacket certainly displayed much of what is wrong with the military and the absurdity of warfare in general, and at the same time was wildly entertaining. (Being a former Marine I can also say it is the closest thing to a real representation of boot camp in that era I have ever seen in film, as well.)

However, this movie was over the top in it's approach, so much so that the jokes and supposed ""funny bits"" were just vapid and sophmoric at best, and at worst, down right demeaning to both the actors, the audience and the real life people they are supposed to be lampooning.  I can't beleive the fine actors in this movie actually read the script before sigining on to make this movie.  The scene with the soldiers wacked out on drugs killing everything that moved comes to mind as one of the worst scenes in the movie.  Was that supposed to be satire?  Or does someone out there think that is an accurate reflection of actual combat soldiers?

If, however, you are intruiged (i.e., confused and stymied) by Bush-era American international relations (or lack thereof), and geopolitical maneuvering, then you may like this show.

John Cusack plays a disaffected hit-man who is forced to go to a central Asian country that has been invaded by a corporate army.  The war is billed as the first corporate military invasion in history.  All troops, armor, weapons, etc., are corporate owned AND operated.  Cusack poses as the organizer and promoter of a huge trade show that will take place in ""The Emerald City"" (i.e., Green zone) in the middle of a raging war.  His main purpose in being there though is to kill the president of a neighboring country so that the corporation can expand its conquest of the region.

The cast is really quite amazing - John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Dan Ackroyd, Ben Kingsley, and more!

It is a sppof and has a spoof feel, and some of the movie really is funny. Conversations held with your navigation device to discuss your problems is a good example of that, because some of the things that it says are truly funny material. Other things also rear their heads and get good laughs as well, and the first half of the movie would have been a five-star beast if it would have kept up its pace. It didn't do that, though, and instead became convoluted and a bit on the boring side. By the end of the movie I was just ready for the thing to end, and i really didn't expect that. I say that because of the main person involved is someone i like, and he had his hands in the project fromt he beginning. Still, it does have some moments in it and they are really good moments, so I didn't find myself totally hating the movie.

One of the things I did dislike was the way Hilary Duff's character was portrayed. This isn't meant as a knock on her acting skills, but is instead meant to address the issues of the character itself. She goes from an accented star to a person with hidden feelings that sounds like Duff, and that didn't play out well. Neither did the forced love connection that enters the fray, or the overall connection between the past and the present. Looking at the scenes that some of this happens in makes me think that they should have been funny and, if executed properly, they would have been great. They were not played out well, however, and the mixture of many things makes the over-the-top violene seem like it wants to be something like Shoot-em-up but without all the wonderful little things that made that movie funny.

One pro in the movie was the acting of John C., however, but I expected that. I liked what he did with his character and i liked the subtle things that came out when he interacted with other people. I even bought into his killer instincts when they were displayed, and how they made him look like a man that was an artist when it came to killing. As I said before, i simply could not find my footing in the storyline and it diminished the character's capacity to make me laugh, ruining some rather good moments. If John C. was less talented at taking roles and bending them to his will, i would have found the movie even less desirable than I did.

Some people do like this movie a lot and i respect that, too. I want people to know that as well, thinking they should perhaps read why they thought the movie was a good one and measure those pros and cons. As i pointed out in my review, I liked the start of this beast and I thought that it had quite a few moments that really took the proverbial cake.

It tries to be a prequel to Grosse Pointe Blank but fails miserably.

The film's direction is absolutely unbearable. You go here and there and all as fast as possible but without reason. Every line is some kind of political jab that is as obvious as what you expect from a high school student's creative writing paper.

There are moments when the satire does come through but the sloppiness of the writing ruins the film. I will be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. Ten minutes in I was checking my watch. Thirty minutes in I started using fast forward to jump ahead. Finally the nightmare was over and I could take it out of the dvd player.

I do not see how anyone could sit through this whole movie. The actors are good, I have no problem with political satire when done well but it is the writing that is horrible. It's a poorly executed mess. That's probably why it was shelved for several years before finally seeing a small theatrical release and why I never heard of it during that time and recently discovering it. Someone looked at the shelf and decided they spent a lot of money on it, no one remembered it so maybe they should see if they could put JC's photo on the front and sell some to get their money back. A very American problem is shown here, get it out the door and who cares how good it is.

I have enjoyed many John Cusack movies. I thought his recent The Martian Child was very good. The producers were hoping in War Inc. to up the ante on Grosse Pointe Blank, with a higher body count and a higher level of mercenary insanity. Unfortunately lightning rarely strikes twice.

There are several reasons the movie fails, and I can't list them all. First, the movie tries too hard to be clever -- it brims over with absurdities that are supposed to be amusing. But the emphasis seems to be on making an over-the-top political statement about USA's military-industrial complex (comparing it to the killer-for-hire business in Grosse Pointe), and the personal conflict of Cusack's character in War Inc seems less integral to the plot. It doesn't reach us on the same personal level, either in the comedy or the romance, that it did in Grosse Pointe.

This movie might be very well-received in countries with the lowest opinion of American military power and foreign policy. It might also find a sympathetic audience among those in this country who view our corporations and hawkish politicians as evil killers. But the dialog isn't sharp enough, the skewering doesn't have enough resonance, to make this a great movie, or even a good one.

What separates a black comedy like this from a classic like Dr. Strangelove? Sharper writing, better performances, and subtlety. War Inc. is about as subtle as its pop icon Yonica's hip-gyrating ""I want to blow you... UP!"" musical performance. This movie is as subtle as a train wreck.

3148327,2,B0015XHQVC,"Well, John Cusack is in an other kooky flick that's take place in the not-so-distant future in an imaginary country called Turaqistan, of which has recently been defeated by contracted soldiers in the name of corporate greed. Like a reality trade show, Turaqistan is going to become the star of an international show in which it is rebuilt with the help of Tammerlane sponsorship. The protagonist is sent to the country under the cover of a contractor-producer for the major rebuilding show. But really he's an assassin sent to take out an Omar Sharif, the oil minister who attempts to nationalize certain pipe-lines that have yet to be constructed. This assassin, Hauser, is a bitter man, a lonely man, a man who found his wife murdered and his child kidnapped. Only the continuation of corrupt international corporate warfare will pay his bills.

Under his cover job, Hauser mostly chaperoned what was considered the Brittany Spears of Turaqistan. Yonika is a sexually obsessed singer who is future wife of the heir to the Turaqistan throne. Though Hauser is later exposed to her secret obsession with playing acoustic ballads. In English. This is somehow supposed to be more true and native to the woman. I didn't really buy it. Wouldn't she be speaking in her own tongue, using native instruments and styles? Maybe I'm just crazy.

There's also a journalist who protested the war and naturally hates Hauser. For some random reason Hauser grows an infatuation with the woman. Her character only serves as a plot-device to get the three characters into an abandoned manor for an interview with the singer, sponsored by Houser. Here, they are attacked by the fianc's entourage who are now shunned by the government for attempting to digitize Yonika's consummation on DVD. Really though, they were used as fodder by Hauser and Sharif so that the heir to the Turaqi throne remains blameless for such a scandal.

The entourage was a little ticked.

But most end up dead and the hands of Hauser.

There are a few more action scenes that involve the journalist's kidnapping and eventual rescue. Hauser confronting his boss in an almost wacky chase scene along with the revelation of Hauser's daughter. Turns out, she's Yonika. What a twist! This was kind of ridiculous since there is almost no evidence in the beginning or middle scenes that give credit to Yonika's American origin. Other than the fact that she doesn't know who her father is. Whoopdi do. Seems a little extravagant for a kidnapper, who turns out to be Hauser's old boss, to raise a random girl in a Mid-Eastern nation to blossom into sexy pop star and marry heir to the Turaqi throne, just to make things weird for Hauser.

But I digress.

This flick is somewhat witty in an all too frightful satire of American corporate imperialism, but it just doesn't pull off the moral/satirical message that it attempts to convey. The acting and protagonist set-up is so inclined to an older flick that War, Inc. might as well have been called Gross Pointe Blank II: Revenge of Dan Ackroyd. The general plot development seemed so random at times that I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie about victims of a Middle Eastern war or victims of the screenwriter's strike. Then there were the pity scenes. That's right, the scenes given to Joan Cusack because she happens to be related to John Cusack. Again, Joan plays an all too often pissy secretary and over-embellishes everything she says. Cut her off!

Likely Page Break
The overall satire was kind of ironic as well. Obviously it illustrates the growing concern of corporate greed on an international scale and man's obsession with pop culture. But a lot of action scenes are initiated by an entourage of dim-witted Mid-Easterners that must be pulverized by the white anti-hero, Hauser. A little too great white hope symbolism, though I do appreciate the insanity of the American troops out in the battle-field listening to metal as they spray bullets into an already war-torn city. Overall the ratio between exposing the wrongs of American imperialism and fundamentalist terrorism is pretty even.

The end of the movie was definitely something left to be desired. It's like they threw a bunch of annoyingly inconsistent characters into one big happy family after the whole daughter situation is discovered. I'm just glad that I saw a missile chase after their plane at the end. If only Joan Cusack's character was on it.",1231027200,,4428,4.8933333333333335

The actors are just fine, and the ideas are fine, but it's a poorly executed mess. That's probably why it was shelved for several years before finally seeing a small theatrical release. And if this is the best job the editors could do with it... then I'd hate to see what the original first several cuts looked like.

Going into this movie I really wanted to like it. I loved ""Grosse Point Blank."" (This is supposed to be an unofficial sequel of sorts.) I love the Cusacks' work. I like the concept. I tried very hard to like the film, but had to leave after watching most of it. Like I said, if you can ignore things like sloppy, loose-ended writing and film direction that's the visual equivalent to hearing fingernails on a chalk board, you stand a chance of enjoying it. I couldn't deal with this horrible mess no matter how hard I tried. I'm giving it two stars instead of one simply because I didn't watch the last twenty minutes or so, and while I doubt it got any better, I have to allow for some slack. Otherwise this would be a one star review.

Most likely you are better off watching ""Grosse Point Blank"" again instead.",1227916800,,1479,4.4944237918215615

Hillary Duff is perfect as the spoiled, self-absorbed pop star and Marisa Tomei brings home the part of the left-wing journalist trying to make sense of the ludicrous situation. And, of course, Joan Cusack is always a pleasure to watch especially when she's playing off her brother.

3148339,3,B0015XHQVC,"Most people will NOT enjoy this movie, but a select few will find it provocatively funny.  War, Inc. is an almost surreal blend of Dr. Strangelove, Grosse Point Blank, Fargo, Apocalypse Now, and a cerebral National Lampoon movie (if such a contradiction in terms were possible... imagine Animal House Goes to Iraq).  Don't bother if you're annoyed by convoluted subplots backfilled by indiscriminate flashback scenes, or looking for a good laugh in a light romantic comedy.

Despite an all-star cast (John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley and Dan Akroyd), War, Inc. will fall flat for most people.  Set in a fictional third-world Islamic country, this satire of the American military-industrial complex is a blatant backdrop for further jabs at the Cheney/Halliburton/Blackwater junta.  John Cusack's ability to write some of the cleverest dialogue in modern cinema allows his character to be interesting and sometimes brilliant, (especially when interacting with Marisa Tomei and Hilary Duff).  Good acting and interesting dialogue will not be enough for the average viewer to enjoy this film.  Offensively hilarious scenes (a chorus line of local war amputees on prosthetic legs) will either leave the viewer rolling on the floor or slack-jawed in revulsion.

There's something reminiscent in War, Inc. of the failed 1983 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deal-of-the-Century/dp/B000BYA4KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deal of the Century</a>, another satire of the military industrial complex with a great cast (Chevy Chase, Sigourney Weaver and Gregory Hines).  Unlike the mediocre Deal of the Century, Cusacks' newest film is more like Fargo in the sense you'll either love or hate it; but unlike Fargo, I think the vast majority of viewers will fall on the wrong side of getting the punch line.  Like a Big Mac, this film blends a lot of different ingredients together (perhaps too many), and like a Big Mac, you'll either be delighted or disgusted... which is why I gave it 3 stars, because you'll give it either 1 or 5.

You'll like this movie if:
You prefer watching Dr. Strangelove or Grosse Point Blank after a six pack or some mind-altering substance.

You'll dislike this movie if:

3148348,1,B0015XHQVC,"WAR, INC. tries very hard to be a film of consequence - as though no one in this country has a clue of just how absurdly grotesque our military/corporate presence affects the countries we attack to help. The position is taken that corporate greed and manifold insanity is (surprise!) capable of taking over demolished countries and changing them into profitable adventures. That may be funny to some, but it has been written about and filmed and satirized so often that it is really yesterday's lunch.

Joshua Seftel directs this m&eacute;lange with a semi-spacey, overly active pyrotechnics team and relies on a script by the oh-so-obvious committee quality pasted together by producer/writer/actor John Cusack and Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser. Despite all the noise and kitschy bleeps in taste the cast manages to keep our attention merely because they are as good as they are as actors: John Cusack with his ever-present drink of Tabasco sauce, Joan Cusack playing Joan Cusack very well, Marisa Tomei as probably the most convincing character despite the script, Dan Aykroyd as a stand in for Dick Cheney, and Hilary Duff in a surprisingly good potty-mouthed central role.

The jokes are old, the situation is not novel, the pr&eacute;cis is sad - and if that makes for entertainment for you,  then have at it.  For this viewer it is one of the poorest scripts to be filmed in a long time.  Grady Harp, October 08",1224288000,20,1417,4.912133891213389
3148349,5,B0015XHQVC,"I have a confession to make: John Cusack is one of my all-time favorite actors.

Okay. Now you know my bias. Proceed at your own risk.

John's latest movie -- the much-hyped, limited-release, and all-but-banned -- War, Inc. is tremendous.

But not for the reason you think.

I bought the movie the minute it was released. I purposely avoided reading reviews of it (except for skimming its rating and a few sentences about it on Rotten Tomatoes) because I wanted to see it for myself. All I knew going into it was that it was supposed to be (a) a comedy, and (b) a thinly veiled, left-wing satire that skewers 21st century American warmongers.

I knew the cast included John, his sister Joan, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Dan Aykroyd, and Ben Kinglsey -- a dream cast if I've ever seen one. I knew John played a hit man with conflicted emotions, a growing conscience that affected his performance. I knew Joan (another of my favorite actors) played his hit-scheduler. Together, John and Joan were (more or less) reprising their roles in another favorite movie of mine: Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), about a hit man who attends his high-school reunion.

That was it.

Well, almost it. I knew from reading the dozens of rabid fans on his MySpace page that War, Inc. was An Important Movie, a Stick-It-To-The-Republicans film that would surely expose the Bush administration for the turd-pile that it is.

I watched it tonight. Apart from the hype, laying aside its flaws (more about that in a minute), forgetting its supposed anti-Bush bias, War, Inc., is a very good movie that offers far more than meets the eye.

Here's the story:

Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is sent to the fictional country of Turaqistan to kill Omar Sharif, a Middle Eastern oil minister, by the ex-Vice President (Aykroyd) who is now head honcho for a conglomerate called Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). Hauser's cover is to pose as a Tamerlane trade-show producer. On the plane to Turaqistan, Mr. Vice President says to him, ""This is a historic moment, Hauser. The first war ever to be 100 percent outsourced to private enterprise. Tamerlane jets. Tamerlane tanks. Tamerlane soldiers."" Marsha Dillion (Joan) constantly urges Hauser to focus his time and energy on Omar so that they can get the hell out of the country, mission accomplished.

That's the premise of the movie. Ostensibly. There's more to this movie than that. So if that's all you expect from War, Inc., you're sure to be disappointed.

When Hauser arrives in Turaqistan, he's dumbstruck by the advertisements plastered everywhere. Even a tank rolls by sporting ads from Popeye's, Golden Palace Casino, and FT Financial Times on its side. Turiqistan is one big product placement, all funded by Halib -- I mean, Tamerlane.

Hauser meets and falls for a hot ""left-wing"" reporter named Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei). He also meets a Britney Spears-like sleazy pop star named Yonica Babyyeah (Duff) who tries to seduce him.

The rest of the movie is, essentially, Hauser pursuing Natalie, avoiding Yonica, and tracking Omar. There's a backstory that slowly teases its way into the open about 3/4 of the way through the movie. It seems Walken (Kingsley), a high ranking member of the CIA -- who recruited Hauser to be a hit man for an op code-named ""Operation Chickenhawk"" -- plays a more sinister role...revealed at the end to be even worse than revealed in the backstory.

A few key/interesting scenes:

1. The Implanted Journalist Experience -- in which journalists are implanted with a chip, given goggles and ear buds and seated in a Disney-like thrill ride as they watch movies of the war. ""We are now able to reduce the risk of journalist mortality to virtually zero. The Combat O' Rama implantation device will allow you to experience full-spectrum sensory reality...thanks and enjoy your ride."" Surreal.

2. While Hauser sits in his Humvee putting Omar in his cross hairs, a hopped-up tank full of American soldiers careens around a corner, shooting at everything in sight. One soldier approaches the Humvee carrying his dry cleaning. The solider eats a packet of dried coffee grounds, beats his head against the Humvee and acts like he's drunk on the sheer joy of killing. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

3. Natalie dancing with Omar. Marisa is a hottie and I enjoy watching her move.

4. Yonica putting a live scorpion in her pants, then asking one of her handlers to reach in and get it while Hauser watches in disbelief. Yonica is also a hottie, albeit a sluttier-than-thou one. I enjoy watching her move, too.

5. Hauser walking in on Yonica in her hotel room as she's singing a pretty song while strumming an acoustic guitar. If this movie had metaphorical overtones, this scene would be chief among them. It is the meeting of two people who are hollow inside, both struggling to come to grips with the worlds they've created for themselves. Whereas some would say this scene slows the pace of the movie, I say this scene is the movie. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

6. A line uttered by Hauser to Walken, the CIA man (Kingsley): ""Whoever momentarily interrupts the accumulation of wealth we pulverize. I'm just not feeling good about that any more, Sir.""

7. Natalie, Yonica, and Hauser sipping wine (Yonica hates wine and requested milk) in an abandoned mansion. They get to talking, and ask Hauser if he's ever been married. This is where Hauser reveals his backstory: ""I came home one night and my beautiful wife had been slaughtered."" Plus, his daughter is taken, without a ransom note. So, in one fell swoop Hauser loses his entire family. It's enough to drive anyone to be a hit man. (More about that in a moment.)

8. Hauser and Natalie running for their lives through a No-Go zone, hugging corners of bombed-out buildings, dashing in and around abandoned cars, diving for cover behind piles of dirt. Suddenly, a chopper appears in the night, hovers over the building, and sets machine guns blazing -- on the crowd of unarmed civilians emerging from the darkness. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

9. Kinglsey's character telling Hauser: ""War is the improvement of investment climates by other means...The USA is a subdivision of Tamerlane. Democracy, the war on terror, the war on drugs: these are all focus-group slogans for Tamerlane."" Again, this is supposed to be part of the movie's foundational premise. Tamerlane/Halliburton starts wars, then supplies wars with products to conduct the war, and even the products afterwards with which to rebuild the countries it destroys.

After a surprise I didn't see coming, the movie ends with everyone getting his/her due. Roll credits. And that's that.

Or is it? Let me see if I can explain what I think War, Inc., is really about.

First, this isn't the blatant anti-war movie everyone -- including its creator John Cusack -- would like you to believe. Scenes of advertisement-torn Turaqistan, the ubiquitousness of Tamerlane, and the mercenary-like ex Vice President are few and far between. They, perhaps, comprise 35% of the movie. Maybe less. Sure, the movie is set in Turaqistan. Bombs and gun fire are heard occasionally. And you never forget that Tamerlane surrounds you.

But I think War, Inc., is a movie about emptiness and what people do to fill it. Consider:

* Hauser is empty, emotionless. He's a hit man.
* Yonica is empty, emotionless. She's a slut posing as a pop star.
* The ex Vice President is empty, heartless. He's a sociopath mercenary.
* The soldiers are empty, without conscience. They kill at will, anyone and anything.
* The people of Turaqistan are empty, without a country. They're surrounded by death on one side, and Popeye's on the other.
* Marsha is empty, a fellow mercenary, killing for business.
* Tamerlane is empty, a soulless company that lives for capitalism at all cost.
* I would even argue that Natalie, the ""left-wing"" journalist, is empty, too. She relies on causes to give her life meaning.

War, Inc., therefore, is not an anti-war movie. It is also not really a comedy, although it is billed as such. There are a couple of laughs in the movie. But, mostly, it's a movie about people struggling to find meaning in an insane world -- either the world of their own making, or the world thrust upon them.

I realized that when I watched the scene of Hauser and Yonica in the hotel room. It was a touching scene, one that -- if you're watching for it -- revealed the movie's core.

If you view War, Inc., as a rollicking good kick in the pants of Republicans, if you think it's a blistering satire about modern-day war making, you'll be disappointed. Or, even if you like it, you'll miss the movie's deeper meaning.

War, Inc., is a metaphor for life lived without meaning and to what lengths people go to fill the void. Seen through that prism, War, Inc. becomes a movie that serves as a warning to all of us -- Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives, rich, poor, black, white, male, female...whatever. Meaningless is meaningless. It can happen to all of us. Any one of us fights to keep from falling into the emptiness. At any moment we could be Yonica. Or Hauser. Or the head of a Halliburton-like conglomerate that feeds the war machine -- and reaps profit from it. This movie has less to do with Republicans than it does with people who ceased being human. And I know many from both parties who fall in to that category.

The last thing I'll say about War, Inc., is that the scenes of rampaging American soldiers were ham-fisted, which is to say inaccurate and unnecessary to the plot. They were a slap in the face of the thousands of men and women who serve with honor and dignity, who sincerely believe they're helping the Iraqi people. Those scenes in War, Inc. dishonor them and threaten to reduce the movie to left-wing propaganda.

Which is a shame. For War, Inc., is a very well made, multi-layered movie about the human condition that just so happens to be a thinly veiled jab at Halliburton and our propensity to make a buck where no buck should be made.

Those two messages combined -- the emptiness of life and what people do to fill the void, plus the repulsive, highly questionable act of privatizing war -- pack a powerful punch.

3148353,2,B0015XHQVC,"In star/producer/co-writer John Cusack's pet project War, Inc., one character delivers a throwaway line that must surely have been the pitch for the film: ""This is like Strangelove in the desert."" Indeed, one senses the ghosts of savage satires past, like Dr. Strangelove, The President's Analyst, Network and Winter Kills in this topical send-up of BushCo and the post-9/11 `murcan zeitgeist. Unfortunately, one also senses a lack of cohesion in an initially smart script that soon loses focus and goes awkwardly tumbling into broad farce, wildly firing its barbs in too many directions at the same time.

Cusack's character is Brand Hauser, a hot-sauce chugging hit man with a tortured past who seems to be an amalgam of Jason Bourne, Captain Willard and, um, Chuck Barris. He has been dispatched to ""Turaqistan"" (ahem), a war-torn Middle Eastern hot spot ripe for reconstruction and corporate exploitation. He is there to terminate the country's Oil Minister (Lyubomir Neikov) with extreme prejudice. The minister is a spanner in the works for the corporate machinations of Hauser's employer, a former Vice-President turned CEO (Dan Ackroyd, doing a credible quacking Cheney) who now heads Tamerlane (a cross between Halliburton and Blackwater). The prospect of spearheading the ""first completely out-sourced war"" appears to make the ex-Veep harder than Chinese arithmetic. In order to get close to his target, Hauser poses as the event coordinator of a Tamerlane-sponsored trade fair being held in the capital city's ""green zone"". Hauser's front soon proves to be the tougher gig, as he juggles the demands of three women: his fellow operative posing as his P.A. (Joan Cusack), a tenacious lefty journalist (Marisa Tomei) and a petulant pop diva named Yonica Babyyeah (Hilary Duff). Hilarity ensues.

Reportedly, the filmmakers have coyly denied that this is an unofficial sequel to Grosse Pointe Blank, but obvious comparisons abound, particularly in just about every scene that the Cusack siblings share; it feels at the very least to be a nod and a wink to the roles they played in that movie. Admittedly, it is great fun watching those two working together again, but it only serves as a momentary distraction from the film's uneven tone.

I think the malady here is similar to that which plagued Lions for Lambs: an overdose of intent. Redford's film came on too somber and preachy, even for the choir. War, Inc. swings to the opposite extreme; it's too manic and overeager to beat us over the head with what we already know: Iraq is a shameful mess, Bush and his cronies have completely blurred the line between war and commerce, and the majority of the American public is too busy watching the sun rise and set over Brittney's thighs to really notice.

Despite an apparent attempt to be ordinary entertainment, this one rises above all the usual categories. Do you want a cynical mockumentary of Haliburton-style war profiteering? Got it. Do you want pointed jabs at operations funded by Congress's ""black budget?"" Check. Do you want satirical assaults on simplistic sloganeering from every possible direction? It's there. Add in a babe like a pre-meltdown Britney but with hotter hotpants and a bucket of slapstick, and you're headed in the right direction. For example, a major character's name is ""Uckmee Fay."" Speakers of pig-Latin, please take note.

They set the tone from the very first scene. Chevy Chase delivers a ""Mission Impossible"" style of assignment to a high-class assassin, via video, while seated on American Standard's finest. Later, Joan Cusack shows up in the role that she has perfected - the prim, cheery, and murderous psychopath. There's a lot more, too. I laughed all through, even (maybe especially) when I knew that outrage would have been the ""appropriate"" response.

Along with Cusack,  Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff stand out but it is Ben Kingsley who gives us WAR INC.'s most noteworthy performance. I'm guessing Kingsley's character was at one point a bigger part of the story but lost out to either keeping the movie under two hours or to give more time to the relationship of Cusack and Tomei.  Kingsley's scenes are as good as any, and were WAR, INC. to play up the tension between Cusack and him, it might be even better.",1427846400,,737,4.444444444444445

I have always loved his movies, maybe it's because we are a month apart from being twins, or that we have the same satirical view on life(or maybe just his screen persona) irregardless I identify.  Being an ex- Navy service member stationed in the desert supporting USMC for 8 yrs, I take a little offense that the last service member should comment on Cusak's tendencies. After all, that's what service and ex-service members did and do, keep the American freedom and right to hold those opinions. Sadly the military, the very instrument to supposedly ensure these rights are secure, hold it's member as antagonists if they speak up or disagree, and hold others as opponents if they do not have a high regard for the military machine.

Most of the 1-star reviews though seem to be from people who were genuinely shocked about the lopsided politicism. I'm shocked that they're shocked. Unfortunately we have bands of political warriors on this site (of both political persuasions) that troll books, films, and even products they don't like but have never tried. The other 1-stars seem to be from people who just can't get over that this isn't another version of Grosse Pointe Blank. It's not - can the GPB fans move on with their lives now?

So ignore the 5 stars and 1 stars on this one and just watch for yourself.

Back to the movie - yes, it's a bit stupid at points - maybe even a lot stupid. It's supposed to be.

That being said, the characters are enjoyable and have surprising chemistry. We also discover Hilary Duff should play women from other countries for the rest of her career, because the overacting she grew up doing in Disney productions fits perfectly here. That comes off as a knock, but I actually mean this well. Cusack's inherent neuroticism was harnessed well, and Tomei fit in well as the love interest and added her usual sass. Nice cameos involved - I won't spoil the surprises.

I'm not sure how it happened, but this silly little flick actually sucked me in to where I forgot about time & what was going on around me. Not saying it will change your life, but hey, it's free (for prime members) & I bet War, Inc. will at least make you smile.",1377820800,,1614,4.476190476190476

3382763,2,B0015XHQVC,"Every time I see a review of this film comparing it to George Armitage's brilliant GROSSE POINTE BLANK, I get a little angry. Other than the fact that Cusack's character plays a corporate assassin whose ability to kill his target is hampered by a love interest, this is nothing like GROSSE POINTE BLANK. WAR, INC. is a very targeted satire against companies like Haliburton and Blackwater and other privatized armed forces that seems to lose its way amongst a mire of sleepy performances, mostly uninteresting dialogue, and a scattered mix of comedy, romance, action and satire that never seems to gel together.

Cusack, who co-wrote the film, obviously has his heart in the right place as companies like Blackwater and Haliburton seemed to be on the verge of running the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they were prime targets for some good satire. Sadly, that satire doesn't present itself other in some very obvious ways. The only performers who seem to be on their game here are the Cusacks (both John and Joan) and, oddly enough, Hilary Duff, who makes a pretty good case as someone to be treated seriously. Kingsley's casting is inspired, but you get the sense that not even he knows what his character's motivations are. Kingsley is one of the world's greatest living actors and after a brilliant and sadly-underrated performance in John Dahl's 2007 hit-man comedy YOU KILL ME, he still remains somewhat obscure.

The film's plot becomes increasingly convoluted and the film's climax is very forgettable, but the very end of the film is something I remember keenly, not because it was so effective, but because it was so incredibly bizarre.

Not even the talents of Hilary Duff, Ben Kingsley, and Marisa Tomei (generally very good) could save this from mediocrity.  To be fair, Ms Duff dealt with a subtle and complex role very well.  She was cast as a pop starlette from Central Asia, who was looking for a way out of an awful third world country, with a few extra secrets. Ms Tomei played an idealistic journalist who falls for the operator and still wants to unveil corporate and political corruption.  Kingsley does well as the puppet master, managing the fall and rise of kingdoms and pulling our hero's strings.

[Blu-ray</a>] to some extent. This falling under comedy, the makers faced less pressure for 'balance' and, once the location is set to the fantasy and idyllic land of Turaqistan most inhibitions are off and we can watch the likes of John Cusack, Hilary Duff, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley operate in a space where freedom and democracy are being delivered to a grateful country by means of sustained bombing followed by reconstruction and government-financed private enterprise.

I am not going to reveal the plot because most of it can be sourced to news stories by simply changing Turakistan and Ugigistan to some real-world country names. A lot of the comic effect is the process of recognizing 'that scene' as being inspired by 'that real-life event' or 'that actor/character' being the too close for comfort caricature of 'that politician or personality'. It's fun and it's a recommended watch for both those who consider themselves 'well informed' and the occasional viewers/readers of mainstream media productions delivered to us as 'the news'. In the end, the plot as thin and chaotic as any story attempting to portray 'what is' rather than 'what happens' or 'what happened' it's a movie worth watching. I was quite impressed by John Cusack's performance as the assassin with a conscience, Hilary Duff brilliant impersonation of a Middle-East rock star, Joan Cusack as the hysterical and murderous public relations and interrogation expert. It's all done with enthusiasm and talent and it's too bad the movie had such a limited release back in 2008. But that can be partially remedied by watching the movie today and learning and having some fun in the process.

I am going to grant this one 4 stars (most professional critics didn't like it at all) because some of the scenes in the middle aren't as brilliantly executed as those at the opening and the end (I'm not talking about the credits) but it's a great and a 'different' movie to watch and you can do it for free before you buy with Amazon's Prime or Netflix.",1333929600,,3037,6.027777777777778

3382779,3,B0015XHQVC,"As the title suggests, ""War, Inc."" is a satire about the ""business"" that is war, in particular the American propensity for bombing a Middle Eastern country to smithereens (i.e., Iraq and Afghanistan), then exploiting it for everything it's worth - all in the name of ""democracy."" In this particular case, it is the fictional nation of Turaqistan, which the U.S. has recently invaded and where it is now contracting out all its security and reconstruction services to a private corporation called Tamerlane, modeled, none too subtly, on Halliburton and KBR.

John Cusack stars as Brand Hauser, a covert operator working under the auspices of the former vice-president of the United States (Dan Akroyd), whose mission is to take out the CEO of an oil company at a gala wedding reception that Brand himself is supposed to organize. While in the ""safe zone"" - known in common parlance as the Emerald City - Brand meets his high-strung assistant (played by Cusack's real-life sister Joan), the promiscuous celebrity bride (the typecast Hilary Duff), a fellow hit man (Ben Kingsley) who has some personal issues with Brand, and Natalie Hegalhuzen (Marisa Tomei), a liberal reporter from the Nation, who is there to expose the multinational skullduggery and corruption taking place in the country - or as she affectionately calls it ""a democracy on the march land-grab.""

Written by Cusack, Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser and directed by Joshua Seftel, ""War, Inc."" is a largely hit-and-miss affair, with moments of insight and humor alternating with moments of silliness and juvenalia. And as with many films of this type, its air of knowingness occasionally slips over into smugness. Yet, though it feels kind of slapdash and doughy at times, the movie ultimately achieves that artful mixture of the serious and the trivial that is the essence of absurdity. And the Ennio Morricone-flavored score by David Robbins gives the movie the flip, hip air it needs to be effective.

But I must say this movie rises above that to a surprising degree and I found myself enjoying it more and more as it went along.  Cusack managed to make his role reasonably believable, and even likeable, and Marisa Tomei as always was perfect.  In fact Marisa Tomei almost single handedly saved this movie for me.  She is probably the most underrated actress in Hollywood.  Even Hilary Duff was surprisingly good, though she still can't sing.  The political satire aspect of the movie was mostly well done and if anything went easy on the good old USA.  I say this because I just finished reading Peter Dale Scott's ""American War Machine,"" which details the decades long collaboration between the CIA and the US Military with the international drug cartels as a means to an end for the powers that be (i.e., Big oil, Wall Street, and the military industrial complex).

Instead I actually watched the whole thing. The movie attempts to be a satire of US involvement in Iraq, Halliburton and the whole Military Industrial Complex. As a satire it will not give Jonathan Swift any competition. Its so broadly overdone as to be a satire of itself. It portrays a completely privitized military, reporters whose stories are based upon virtual reality rides, an inane and completely pointless subplot involving John Cusack, his boss and one of the other stars, what appear to be mental patients wandering through a free fire zone and similar bizaare scenes. If you are of the left wing persuasion (actually the more extreme left wing) you'll enjoy it. Otherwise you'll likely find it an utter waste of time. Oh btw the enjoyable scenes??

3382785,4,B0015XHQVC,"""War, Inc."" does indeed follow in the steps of ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" but it is quite different.

The satire here is broader and at the same time more focused.  In ""Gross Pointe,"" the targets were Gen-X anomie and individual angst.

Here the targets are political and social: pre-emptive war, the privatization of everything, the selling of everything (happiness, sex, youth, glamor, death), corporatization, the emptiness of celebrity-culture.

This movie doesn't have the energy and snap of ""Grosse Pointe.""  Cusack is jowly and tired.  But ""War, Inc."" makes a virtue of that very tiredness by making Hauser/Cusack's disenchantment more believable.

There are lots of nice touches.

Ben Kingsley is amazing as the Southern-fried CIA psychopath.  (Kingsley tries to strike it rich with a Roman Empire Themepark, complete with His and Hers Vomitoriums.  It fails in the Real Estate collapse, but the parallel between decadent Rome and equally-decadent U.S.A. is clear.)

Ackroyd does a brief, crude, but spot-on slam at Cheney.

Joan Cusack has turned into a zoned-out control-freak corporate harpy, perfect for the role.

Marisa Tomei is mostly OK as the crusading, frustrated reporter.  (She does have a little trouble keeping a straight face.)

But--amazing!--best of all is Hillary Duff.

Duff is superb.  Who knew she could act?  She does.  She acts circles around everyone, even Kingsley.  She is at her best--even more amazing!--not when playing the vamped-out teen slut but when playing the tormented, lost waif.",1294531200,2,1520,5.360169491525424
3382786,1,B0015XHQVC,"My wife and I have loved almost everything John Cusack has ever done.  On the strength of that alone we will watch his stuff when it comes out.  But given the star power in this movie it was a must see.

The advertising made it sound as though Cusack was reprising his role from Grosse Pointe Blank as the introspective, edgy hitman looking to bring sense into his chaotic life and restore his karma to balance.  Throughout the movie (which took three sittings to get all the way through) I kept waiting for some bit of Martin Blank to resurface.  When that seemed to much to hope for I waited for the funny part to begin, which I was sure Cusack would deliver.  When that failed to appear I began to wait for the part where the plot would move along to some engaging point that would keep me entertained through the remainder of the film. It never came.

I know Cusack has some very typical Hollywood left leanings, that's fine.  I know it is popular in Hollywood to bash the military.  Fine, that's your right to do so.  But others have done it in ways that were entertaining and worthwhile.  Kubrick's classic Full Metal Jacket certainly displayed much of what is wrong with the military and the absurdity of warfare in general, and at the same time was wildly entertaining. (Being a former Marine I can also say it is the closest thing to a real representation of boot camp in that era I have ever seen in film, as well.)

However, this movie was over the top in it's approach, so much so that the jokes and supposed ""funny bits"" were just vapid and sophmoric at best, and at worst, down right demeaning to both the actors, the audience and the real life people they are supposed to be lampooning.  I can't beleive the fine actors in this movie actually read the script before sigining on to make this movie.  The scene with the soldiers wacked out on drugs killing everything that moved comes to mind as one of the worst scenes in the movie.  Was that supposed to be satire?  Or does someone out there think that is an accurate reflection of actual combat soldiers?

Like I said I kept waiting for the stars in this movie to shine, but I think a previous reviewer had it correct with Samuel L Jackson's quote.  All the syrup in the world won't hide the bad taste this p.o.s. will leave in your mouth.

If you are after action and all you want is some escapist entertainment you will not like this film, I can almost guarantee it!  If, however, you are intruiged (i.e., confused and stymied) by Bush-era American international relations (or lack thereof), and geopolitical maneuvering, then you may like this show.

John Cusack plays a disaffected hit-man who is forced to go to a central Asian country that has been invaded by a corporate army.  The war is billed as the first corporate military invasion in history.  All troops, armor, weapons, etc., are corporate owned AND operated.  Cusack poses as the organizer and promoter of a huge trade show that will take place in ""The Emerald City"" (i.e., Green zone) in the middle of a raging war.  His main purpose in being there though is to kill the president of a neighboring country so that the corporation can expand its conquest of the region.

The cast is really quite amazing - John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Dan Ackroyd, Ben Kingsley, and more!

When I started watching this film the first time I thought it would end up being just an action adventure/comedy, but as the film went on it started to realize that it's not just satire, but HEAVY-DUTY satire!  In places it's downright hilarious if you know what to look for.  Don't get me wrong...this is NOT a comedy, it's satire.  And, being satirical it is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and consistently confusing (after all, what is more confusing than Bush's approach to international relations?).

3382793,3,B0015XHQVC,"Outsourcing wars, killing people that want to kill you, using charity as cover, and teaching yourself how hot sauce can become a tool of the trade are all things that the movie brings to the table. It is a sppof and has a spoof feel, and some of the movie really is funny. Conversations held with your navigation device to discuss your problems is a good example of that, because some of the things that it says are truly funny material. Other things also rear their heads and get good laughs as well, and the first half of the movie would have been a five-star beast if it would have kept up its pace. It didn't do that, though, and instead became convoluted and a bit on the boring side. By the end of the movie I was just ready for the thing to end, and i really didn't expect that. I say that because of the main person involved is someone i like, and he had his hands in the project fromt he beginning. Still, it does have some moments in it and they are really good moments, so I didn't find myself totally hating the movie.

One of the things I did dislike was the way Hilary Duff's character was portrayed. This isn't meant as a knock on her acting skills, but is instead meant to address the issues of the character itself. She goes from an accented star to a person with hidden feelings that sounds like Duff, and that didn't play out well. Neither did the forced love connection that enters the fray, or the overall connection between the past and the present. Looking at the scenes that some of this happens in makes me think that they should have been funny and, if executed properly, they would have been great. They were not played out well, however, and the mixture of many things makes the over-the-top violene seem like it wants to be something like Shoot-em-up but without all the wonderful little things that made that movie funny.

One pro in the movie was the acting of John C., however, but I expected that. I liked what he did with his character and i liked the subtle things that came out when he interacted with other people. I even bought into his killer instincts when they were displayed, and how they made him look like a man that was an artist when it came to killing. As I said before, i simply could not find my footing in the storyline and it diminished the character's capacity to make me laugh, ruining some rather good moments. If John C. was less talented at taking roles and bending them to his will, i would have found the movie even less desirable than I did.

Some people do like this movie a lot and i respect that, too. I want people to know that as well, thinking they should perhaps read why they thought the movie was a good one and measure those pros and cons. As i pointed out in my review, I liked the start of this beast and I thought that it had quite a few moments that really took the proverbial cake. I just couldn't eat a whole slice because it seemed undercooked and, as everyone knows, uncooing things can poison even the most healthy of persons.

I have enjoyed many John Cusack movies. I thought his recent The Martian Child was very good. The producers were hoping in War Inc. to up the ante on Grosse Pointe Blank, with a higher body count and a higher level of mercenary insanity. Unfortunately lightning rarely strikes twice.

There are several reasons the movie fails, and I can't list them all. First, the movie tries too hard to be clever -- it brims over with absurdities that are supposed to be amusing. But the emphasis seems to be on making an over-the-top political statement about USA's military-industrial complex (comparing it to the killer-for-hire business in Grosse Pointe), and the personal conflict of Cusack's character in War Inc seems less integral to the plot. It doesn't reach us on the same personal level, either in the comedy or the romance, that it did in Grosse Pointe.

This movie might be very well-received in countries with the lowest opinion of American military power and foreign policy. It might also find a sympathetic audience among those in this country who view our corporations and hawkish politicians as evil killers. But the dialog isn't sharp enough, the skewering doesn't have enough resonance, to make this a great movie, or even a good one.

What separates a black comedy like this from a classic like Dr. Strangelove? Sharper writing, better performances, and subtlety. War Inc. is about as subtle as its pop icon Yonica's hip-gyrating ""I want to blow you... UP!"" musical performance. This movie is as subtle as a train wreck.

3382824,2,B0015XHQVC,"Well, John Cusack is in an other kooky flick that's take place in the not-so-distant future in an imaginary country called Turaqistan, of which has recently been defeated by contracted soldiers in the name of corporate greed. Like a reality trade show, Turaqistan is going to become the star of an international show in which it is rebuilt with the help of Tammerlane sponsorship. The protagonist is sent to the country under the cover of a contractor-producer for the major rebuilding show. But really he's an assassin sent to take out an Omar Sharif, the oil minister who attempts to nationalize certain pipe-lines that have yet to be constructed. This assassin, Hauser, is a bitter man, a lonely man, a man who found his wife murdered and his child kidnapped. Only the continuation of corrupt international corporate warfare will pay his bills.

Under his cover job, Hauser mostly chaperoned what was considered the Brittany Spears of Turaqistan. Yonika is a sexually obsessed singer who is future wife of the heir to the Turaqistan throne. Though Hauser is later exposed to her secret obsession with playing acoustic ballads. In English. This is somehow supposed to be more true and native to the woman. I didn't really buy it. Wouldn't she be speaking in her own tongue, using native instruments and styles? Maybe I'm just crazy.

There's also a journalist who protested the war and naturally hates Hauser. For some random reason Hauser grows an infatuation with the woman. Her character only serves as a plot-device to get the three characters into an abandoned manor for an interview with the singer, sponsored by Houser. Here, they are attacked by the fianc's entourage who are now shunned by the government for attempting to digitize Yonika's consummation on DVD. Really though, they were used as fodder by Hauser and Sharif so that the heir to the Turaqi throne remains blameless for such a scandal.

The entourage was a little ticked.

But most end up dead and the hands of Hauser.

There are a few more action scenes that involve the journalist's kidnapping and eventual rescue. Hauser confronting his boss in an almost wacky chase scene along with the revelation of Hauser's daughter. Turns out, she's Yonika. What a twist! This was kind of ridiculous since there is almost no evidence in the beginning or middle scenes that give credit to Yonika's American origin. Other than the fact that she doesn't know who her father is. Whoopdi do. Seems a little extravagant for a kidnapper, who turns out to be Hauser's old boss, to raise a random girl in a Mid-Eastern nation to blossom into sexy pop star and marry heir to the Turaqi throne, just to make things weird for Hauser.

But I digress.

This flick is somewhat witty in an all too frightful satire of American corporate imperialism, but it just doesn't pull off the moral/satirical message that it attempts to convey. The acting and protagonist set-up is so inclined to an older flick that War, Inc. might as well have been called Gross Pointe Blank II: Revenge of Dan Ackroyd. The general plot development seemed so random at times that I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie about victims of a Middle Eastern war or victims of the screenwriter's strike. Then there were the pity scenes. That's right, the scenes given to Joan Cusack because she happens to be related to John Cusack. Again, Joan plays an all too often pissy secretary and over-embellishes everything she says. Cut her off!

Likely Page Break
The overall satire was kind of ironic as well. Obviously it illustrates the growing concern of corporate greed on an international scale and man's obsession with pop culture. But a lot of action scenes are initiated by an entourage of dim-witted Mid-Easterners that must be pulverized by the white anti-hero, Hauser. A little too great white hope symbolism, though I do appreciate the insanity of the American troops out in the battle-field listening to metal as they spray bullets into an already war-torn city. Overall the ratio between exposing the wrongs of American imperialism and fundamentalist terrorism is pretty even.

The end of the movie was definitely something left to be desired. It's like they threw a bunch of annoyingly inconsistent characters into one big happy family after the whole daughter situation is discovered. I'm just glad that I saw a missile chase after their plane at the end. If only Joan Cusack's character was on it.",1231027200,,4428,4.8933333333333335

War, Inc. is an almost surreal blend of Dr. Strangelove, Grosse Point Blank, Fargo, Apocalypse Now, and a cerebral National Lampoon movie (if such a contradiction in terms were possible... imagine Animal House Goes to Iraq).  Don't bother if you're annoyed by convoluted subplots backfilled by indiscriminate flashback scenes, or looking for a good laugh in a light romantic comedy.

Despite an all-star cast (John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley and Dan Akroyd), War, Inc. will fall flat for most people.  Set in a fictional third-world Islamic country, this satire of the American military-industrial complex is a blatant backdrop for further jabs at the Cheney/Halliburton/Blackwater junta.  John Cusack's ability to write some of the cleverest dialogue in modern cinema allows his character to be interesting and sometimes brilliant, (especially when interacting with Marisa Tomei and Hilary Duff).  Good acting and interesting dialogue will not be enough for the average viewer to enjoy this film.  Offensively hilarious scenes (a chorus line of local war amputees on prosthetic legs) will either leave the viewer rolling on the floor or slack-jawed in revulsion.

Unlike the mediocre Deal of the Century, Cusacks' newest film is more like Fargo in the sense you'll either love or hate it; but unlike Fargo, I think the vast majority of viewers will fall on the wrong side of getting the punch line.  Like a Big Mac, this film blends a lot of different ingredients together (perhaps too many), and like a Big Mac, you'll either be delighted or disgusted... which is why I gave it 3 stars, because you'll give it either 1 or 5.

Either way, I think John Cusack is learning more about what he can do in film and how people react to him. He also made a record by not paying for advertising or marketing and using almost only MySpace.

I'm a fan of Cusack and his sister anyway but I was not disappointed in the least in the action and comedy in this movie.

3382845,1,B0015XHQVC,"WAR, INC. tries very hard to be a film of consequence - as though no one in this country has a clue of just how absurdly grotesque our military/corporate presence affects the countries we attack to help. The position is taken that corporate greed and manifold insanity is (surprise!) capable of taking over demolished countries and changing them into profitable adventures. That may be funny to some, but it has been written about and filmed and satirized so often that it is really yesterday's lunch.

Joshua Seftel directs this m&eacute;lange with a semi-spacey, overly active pyrotechnics team and relies on a script by the oh-so-obvious committee quality pasted together by producer/writer/actor John Cusack and Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser. Despite all the noise and kitschy bleeps in taste the cast manages to keep our attention merely because they are as good as they are as actors: John Cusack with his ever-present drink of Tabasco sauce, Joan Cusack playing Joan Cusack very well, Marisa Tomei as probably the most convincing character despite the script, Dan Aykroyd as a stand in for Dick Cheney, and Hilary Duff in a surprisingly good potty-mouthed central role.

The jokes are old, the situation is not novel, the pr&eacute;cis is sad - and if that makes for entertainment for you,  then have at it.  For this viewer it is one of the poorest scripts to be filmed in a long time.  Grady Harp, October 08",1224288000,20,1417,4.912133891213389
3382846,5,B0015XHQVC,"I have a confession to make: John Cusack is one of my all-time favorite actors.

Okay. Now you know my bias. Proceed at your own risk.

John's latest movie -- the much-hyped, limited-release, and all-but-banned -- War, Inc. is tremendous.

But not for the reason you think.

I bought the movie the minute it was released. I purposely avoided reading reviews of it (except for skimming its rating and a few sentences about it on Rotten Tomatoes) because I wanted to see it for myself. All I knew going into it was that it was supposed to be (a) a comedy, and (b) a thinly veiled, left-wing satire that skewers 21st century American warmongers.

I knew the cast included John, his sister Joan, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Dan Aykroyd, and Ben Kinglsey -- a dream cast if I've ever seen one. I knew John played a hit man with conflicted emotions, a growing conscience that affected his performance. I knew Joan (another of my favorite actors) played his hit-scheduler. Together, John and Joan were (more or less) reprising their roles in another favorite movie of mine: Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), about a hit man who attends his high-school reunion.

That was it.

Well, almost it. I knew from reading the dozens of rabid fans on his MySpace page that War, Inc. was An Important Movie, a Stick-It-To-The-Republicans film that would surely expose the Bush administration for the turd-pile that it is.

I watched it tonight. Apart from the hype, laying aside its flaws (more about that in a minute), forgetting its supposed anti-Bush bias, War, Inc., is a very good movie that offers far more than meets the eye.

Here's the story:

Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is sent to the fictional country of Turaqistan to kill Omar Sharif, a Middle Eastern oil minister, by the ex-Vice President (Aykroyd) who is now head honcho for a conglomerate called Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). Hauser's cover is to pose as a Tamerlane trade-show producer. On the plane to Turaqistan, Mr. Vice President says to him, ""This is a historic moment, Hauser. The first war ever to be 100 percent outsourced to private enterprise. Tamerlane jets. Tamerlane tanks. Tamerlane soldiers."" Marsha Dillion (Joan) constantly urges Hauser to focus his time and energy on Omar so that they can get the hell out of the country, mission accomplished.

That's the premise of the movie. Ostensibly. There's more to this movie than that. So if that's all you expect from War, Inc., you're sure to be disappointed.

When Hauser arrives in Turaqistan, he's dumbstruck by the advertisements plastered everywhere. Even a tank rolls by sporting ads from Popeye's, Golden Palace Casino, and FT Financial Times on its side. Turiqistan is one big product placement, all funded by Halib -- I mean, Tamerlane.

Hauser meets and falls for a hot ""left-wing"" reporter named Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei). He also meets a Britney Spears-like sleazy pop star named Yonica Babyyeah (Duff) who tries to seduce him.

The rest of the movie is, essentially, Hauser pursuing Natalie, avoiding Yonica, and tracking Omar. There's a backstory that slowly teases its way into the open about 3/4 of the way through the movie. It seems Walken (Kingsley), a high ranking member of the CIA -- who recruited Hauser to be a hit man for an op code-named ""Operation Chickenhawk"" -- plays a more sinister role...revealed at the end to be even worse than revealed in the backstory.

A few key/interesting scenes:

1. The Implanted Journalist Experience -- in which journalists are implanted with a chip, given goggles and ear buds and seated in a Disney-like thrill ride as they watch movies of the war. ""We are now able to reduce the risk of journalist mortality to virtually zero. The Combat O' Rama implantation device will allow you to experience full-spectrum sensory reality...thanks and enjoy your ride."" Surreal.

2. While Hauser sits in his Humvee putting Omar in his cross hairs, a hopped-up tank full of American soldiers careens around a corner, shooting at everything in sight. One soldier approaches the Humvee carrying his dry cleaning. The solider eats a packet of dried coffee grounds, beats his head against the Humvee and acts like he's drunk on the sheer joy of killing. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

3. Natalie dancing with Omar. Marisa is a hottie and I enjoy watching her move.

4. Yonica putting a live scorpion in her pants, then asking one of her handlers to reach in and get it while Hauser watches in disbelief. Yonica is also a hottie, albeit a sluttier-than-thou one. I enjoy watching her move, too.

5. Hauser walking in on Yonica in her hotel room as she's singing a pretty song while strumming an acoustic guitar. If this movie had metaphorical overtones, this scene would be chief among them. It is the meeting of two people who are hollow inside, both struggling to come to grips with the worlds they've created for themselves. Whereas some would say this scene slows the pace of the movie, I say this scene is the movie. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

6. A line uttered by Hauser to Walken, the CIA man (Kingsley): ""Whoever momentarily interrupts the accumulation of wealth we pulverize. I'm just not feeling good about that any more, Sir.""

7. Natalie, Yonica, and Hauser sipping wine (Yonica hates wine and requested milk) in an abandoned mansion. They get to talking, and ask Hauser if he's ever been married. This is where Hauser reveals his backstory: ""I came home one night and my beautiful wife had been slaughtered."" Plus, his daughter is taken, without a ransom note. So, in one fell swoop Hauser loses his entire family. It's enough to drive anyone to be a hit man. (More about that in a moment.)

8. Hauser and Natalie running for their lives through a No-Go zone, hugging corners of bombed-out buildings, dashing in and around abandoned cars, diving for cover behind piles of dirt. Suddenly, a chopper appears in the night, hovers over the building, and sets machine guns blazing -- on the crowd of unarmed civilians emerging from the darkness. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)

9. Kinglsey's character telling Hauser: ""War is the improvement of investment climates by other means...The USA is a subdivision of Tamerlane. Democracy, the war on terror, the war on drugs: these are all focus-group slogans for Tamerlane."" Again, this is supposed to be part of the movie's foundational premise. Tamerlane/Halliburton starts wars, then supplies wars with products to conduct the war, and even the products afterwards with which to rebuild the countries it destroys.

After a surprise I didn't see coming, the movie ends with everyone getting his/her due. Roll credits. And that's that.

Or is it? Let me see if I can explain what I think War, Inc., is really about.

First, this isn't the blatant anti-war movie everyone -- including its creator John Cusack -- would like you to believe. Scenes of advertisement-torn Turaqistan, the ubiquitousness of Tamerlane, and the mercenary-like ex Vice President are few and far between. They, perhaps, comprise 35% of the movie. Maybe less. Sure, the movie is set in Turaqistan. Bombs and gun fire are heard occasionally. And you never forget that Tamerlane surrounds you.

But I think War, Inc., is a movie about emptiness and what people do to fill it. Consider:

* Hauser is empty, emotionless. He's a hit man.
* Yonica is empty, emotionless. She's a slut posing as a pop star.
* The ex Vice President is empty, heartless. He's a sociopath mercenary.
* The soldiers are empty, without conscience. They kill at will, anyone and anything.
* The people of Turaqistan are empty, without a country. They're surrounded by death on one side, and Popeye's on the other.
* Marsha is empty, a fellow mercenary, killing for business.
* Tamerlane is empty, a soulless company that lives for capitalism at all cost.
* I would even argue that Natalie, the ""left-wing"" journalist, is empty, too. She relies on causes to give her life meaning.

War, Inc., therefore, is not an anti-war movie. It is also not really a comedy, although it is billed as such. There are a couple of laughs in the movie. But, mostly, it's a movie about people struggling to find meaning in an insane world -- either the world of their own making, or the world thrust upon them.

I realized that when I watched the scene of Hauser and Yonica in the hotel room. It was a touching scene, one that -- if you're watching for it -- revealed the movie's core.

If you view War, Inc., as a rollicking good kick in the pants of Republicans, if you think it's a blistering satire about modern-day war making, you'll be disappointed. Or, even if you like it, you'll miss the movie's deeper meaning.

War, Inc., is a metaphor for life lived without meaning and to what lengths people go to fill the void. Seen through that prism, War, Inc. becomes a movie that serves as a warning to all of us -- Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives, rich, poor, black, white, male, female...whatever. Meaningless is meaningless. It can happen to all of us. Any one of us fights to keep from falling into the emptiness. At any moment we could be Yonica. Or Hauser. Or the head of a Halliburton-like conglomerate that feeds the war machine -- and reaps profit from it. This movie has less to do with Republicans than it does with people who ceased being human. And I know many from both parties who fall in to that category.

The last thing I'll say about War, Inc., is that the scenes of rampaging American soldiers were ham-fisted, which is to say inaccurate and unnecessary to the plot. They were a slap in the face of the thousands of men and women who serve with honor and dignity, who sincerely believe they're helping the Iraqi people. Those scenes in War, Inc. dishonor them and threaten to reduce the movie to left-wing propaganda.

Which is a shame. For War, Inc., is a very well made, multi-layered movie about the human condition that just so happens to be a thinly veiled jab at Halliburton and our propensity to make a buck where no buck should be made.

Those two messages combined -- the emptiness of life and what people do to fill the void, plus the repulsive, highly questionable act of privatizing war -- pack a powerful punch. But I think one has to take both aspects into account for the movie to deliver the knockout its creators seek.",1224201600,8,10324,4.777091521617069

3382850,2,B0015XHQVC,"In star/producer/co-writer John Cusack's pet project War, Inc., one character delivers a throwaway line that must surely have been the pitch for the film: ""This is like Strangelove in the desert."" Indeed, one senses the ghosts of savage satires past, like Dr. Strangelove, The President's Analyst, Network and Winter Kills in this topical send-up of BushCo and the post-9/11 `murcan zeitgeist. Unfortunately, one also senses a lack of cohesion in an initially smart script that soon loses focus and goes awkwardly tumbling into broad farce, wildly firing its barbs in too many directions at the same time.

Cusack's character is Brand Hauser, a hot-sauce chugging hit man with a tortured past who seems to be an amalgam of Jason Bourne, Captain Willard and, um, Chuck Barris. He has been dispatched to ""Turaqistan"" (ahem), a war-torn Middle Eastern hot spot ripe for reconstruction and corporate exploitation. He is there to terminate the country's Oil Minister (Lyubomir Neikov) with extreme prejudice. The minister is a spanner in the works for the corporate machinations of Hauser's employer, a former Vice-President turned CEO (Dan Ackroyd, doing a credible quacking Cheney) who now heads Tamerlane (a cross between Halliburton and Blackwater). The prospect of spearheading the ""first completely out-sourced war"" appears to make the ex-Veep harder than Chinese arithmetic. In order to get close to his target, Hauser poses as the event coordinator of a Tamerlane-sponsored trade fair being held in the capital city's ""green zone"". Hauser's front soon proves to be the tougher gig, as he juggles the demands of three women: his fellow operative posing as his P.A. (Joan Cusack), a tenacious lefty journalist (Marisa Tomei) and a petulant pop diva named Yonica Babyyeah (Hilary Duff). Hilarity ensues.

Reportedly, the filmmakers have coyly denied that this is an unofficial sequel to Grosse Pointe Blank, but obvious comparisons abound, particularly in just about every scene that the Cusack siblings share; it feels at the very least to be a nod and a wink to the roles they played in that movie. Admittedly, it is great fun watching those two working together again, but it only serves as a momentary distraction from the film's uneven tone.

I think the malady here is similar to that which plagued Lions for Lambs: an overdose of intent. Redford's film came on too somber and preachy, even for the choir. War, Inc. swings to the opposite extreme; it's too manic and overeager to beat us over the head with what we already know: Iraq is a shameful mess, Bush and his cronies have completely blurred the line between war and commerce, and the majority of the American public is too busy watching the sun rise and set over Brittney's thighs to really notice. I'm afraid that War, Inc. is another case of ""I really wanted to like this, but...""",1223856000,6,2846,5.051063829787234
