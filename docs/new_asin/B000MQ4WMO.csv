It looks really good on DVD, but it is an old movie and I don't expect 1080p. But it is damn close. The DVD was in perfect condition and it arrived earlier than expected.",1393459200,,293,3.7419354838709675
8643248,1,B000MQ4WMO,"I'm really disappointed with Amazon.

All my other orders had no problems at all but around August of 2011 I got this dvd, because my mom was a big fan of it.

The movie arrived all closed and I didn't touch anything because I would take it to Brazil to give to my mom as a gift.
On November of 2011 when I gave this product to my mother as a gift, some minutes later she comes to me saying that there was no dvd inside.
WoW, I was really surprised amazon didn't check the box before or I hope it was just a factory mistake.

I have the plastic that she unwrapped with the box.

I hope Amazon can do something because it was bad for me to see my mother so happy and all of a sudden, nothing in the case.

Returning to US on Nov 25th.",1321660800,,733,3.8926174496644297
