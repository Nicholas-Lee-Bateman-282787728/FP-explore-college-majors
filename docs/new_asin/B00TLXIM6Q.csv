7013012,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"I've seen most of this series, and its really good. I love drama and romance animes, so I can't wait until anime works releases this series. I have it on pre-order on amazon. I give this series a 9 out of 10.",1435881600,,208,3.9761904761904763
7013013,1,B00TLXIM6Q,"Don't waste your money on this release. The anime is good if you like drama and romance, but this release from Media Blasters is an embarrassment. Burn DVD-Rs instead of pressed DVDs, extremely low bitrate with many compression artifacts, scratches from the DVD case, and poor customer service when asked about the quality of the release. Not sure how they couldn't see all the issues.",1435622400,21,385,4.938461538461539
7013014,1,B00TLXIM6Q,"Like others have pointed out, this release sucks. I had read elsewhere that the issues with the release were resolved, but the copy I bought is junk just like I was worried about. I bought my copy at an anime con, figuring I wouldn't run into any issues since I bought it directly from the publisher. After leaving the con, I realized that the back specifically says ""Note: This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media"". I prayed that that wouldn't mean that the discs were useless, but they basically are.

These discs WILL NOT play on a ps3 or a ps4. I have tried both. I have also tried playing the discs in an Mac, and not even VLC could read the file format. It wasn't until I tested it in my laptop that the discs could be read. If I buy a DVD set at full price from a legit seller, I want to be able to play the discs in any normal DVD player. I would not suggest purchasing this set and wish I would have taken the reviews more seriously when I had researched it online in the past.

In terms of the series itself, please research what you're getting yourself into. The final arc is straight up incest and teeters as far as it possibly can without getting a mature rating. If you're into that kinda stuff or can see past it, this is a great series. If not, don't even mess with this show.",1478908800,2,1319,4.23015873015873
7013015,5,B00TLXIM6Q,Good show.,1463616000,,10,4.5
7013016,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"Great set, love Yosuga no Sora, its a great series, one of my favorites.
Each story arc is on a different disc (4 discs total). The image is good,
the audio is also good. Not many extras outside of a small slideshow
with various images on the first disc. Great to own if you're a fan of
the series and want to own a physical set, I doubt we'll ever get a
localized blu-ray set so grab this while you can!",1458950400,,404,4.0
7013017,4,B00TLXIM6Q,"The 1st three story arcs were great! Slice of life, romance. Very enjoyable. The 4th disc/arc not so much. Otherwise this would be 5 stars for the anime. The 4th disc was scratched up from shipping, but I was still able to watch some of it, and it got too weird for me anyway, so no big deal. If you do buy it, don't pay too much for it.",1458950400,3,337,3.898550724637681
7013018,4,B00TLXIM6Q,"This is for the packaging and not the show itself. The show is great, music is great, the various stories are great. Now, the item itself. It case is a very basic case. When I first opened it, all the DVDs were loose and all over the place. I placed them back in the prongs and, a few minutes later, they were out and loose all over again. I'm honestly shocked that nothing is damaged.",1451174400,,385,4.1466666666666665
7013019,5,B00TLXIM6Q,Great anime but I would not let anyone under 21 watch.  Kentucky and Japan you have so much in common.  The part were he asked he's sister if he can put in in.  I was like WAT?,1450828800,2,176,3.7027027027027026
7013020,4,B00TLXIM6Q,The artwork was good. As for the story it was ok. I kind of knew what might happen before I got the dvd.,1441670400,2,104,3.5652173913043477
7013021,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"First let me say that this NOT FOR CHILDREN under 17, this not because of the partial nudity, but more for the incest them on the 4th disc. In fact this could almost pass for soft porn.  I have to say that as far as eechi romance goes this is at the top of the list now this is12 episodes on a 4 disc package 4 episodes per disc. Just so you know the first episode is repeated on every disc. Now I had seen this before and it is exact in every way to the broadcast version. this is totally uncensored including the finally disc. the quality is as good or better than the broadcast version which was pretty dam good. This is another one of those sleepers that in Japan took the country by storm for the content as well as the artwork which is fantastic to say the least. This is one anime I could see over and over again, ( great to see with your girl ). I know that once this is seen it will catch on and become a sleeper here in the U.S. Trust me the person who drew this was a true artist, one that knows the human body. I gave this 10 out 10",1441152000,12,1044,3.9014084507042255
7013022,5,B00TLXIM6Q,The package comes quickly and in good condition and the images they look great GREAT JOB.,1438387200,,89,4.625
8702257,5,B00TLXIM6Q,A great title if you can get through the last arc.  At bit intense. Otherwise the art and music are sublime,1526342400,,107,4.095238095238095
8702258,1,B00TLXIM6Q,"Got the DVDs in the mail fine, but none of them would play in my DVD player, my Xbox, or my computer. Am not satisfied and kinda ticked off.",1523750400,,140,3.8620689655172415
8702259,1,B00TLXIM6Q,it doesn't work.,1517270400,2,16,4.666666666666667
8702260,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"This is THE most tear-jerking anime that I have ever seen in my entire life. Almost no movie or TV show has ever brought tears to my eyes. The story, the characters' individual backstories, the soundtrack. All that put together is so lovely. The finale was so sweet and tender, it actually had me crying for maybe about a half-hour, and I am not at all ashamed to say that. Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude Where We Are At Least Alone will melt your heart, as long as you can keep an open mind to all the content within the story of this anime.",1494115200,,539,4.1923076923076925
8702261,1,B00TLXIM6Q,Absolutely Idiotic!!! No story line!  Only good thing is the level of animation is good.  Other than that don't bother with it!,1490918400,,127,4.7272727272727275
8702262,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"I read the horror stories of the dvd version, thankfully they seem to have redeemed themselves with the blu ray. I had pre ordered this back in January they messed up their deadline  and I got mine almost 3 weeks after the original release date.
At first I feared they ran out of marker writing bluray on their burns, but enough sarcasm. Not sure how the dvd menu was this each disc has 2 heroine arcs disc 1 has over 5 minutes of extras of the heroines in various poses etc. I really wish class president  would have gotten an arc but this was still one great VN to anime despite the controversial twincest prevalent in arc 4 Soras arc. Both video and audio are gorgeous and clear my only minor complaint would be if you want to skip op. song you pass 3+ minutes of show so you'll have to FF instead, but I've seen much worse skipping to halfway or more on some. Hope this helps anyone who got burned on dvd (pun not intended) this version is well worth it and I hope to see more great VN to anime in this style. Tried to upload a pic with tablet camera I hope that is helpful though the camera isn't very good.",1489276800,3,1112,4.167441860465116
8702263,1,B00TLXIM6Q,"Great series overall though it would be nice if the actual discs played. I tried getting them to work on a dvd player, ps4, xbox 360 and even my pc to no avail. I can't see why anyone would rate this 5 stars unless they actually rated it before they got their hands on the product. I'm terribly disappointed and want a refund.",1488153600,5,326,4.190476190476191
8702264,5,B00TLXIM6Q,"This is a wonderful anime that will tug at your heartstrings in certain parts and make you laugh uncontrollably in others, it does have taboo relations in it but it's nothing smutty or disgusting so keep an open mind when you watch. If you can't keep a open mind on the taboo relations stuff this anime is not for you.
Glad the Bluray has finally arrived!",1487116800,5,355,4.393939393939394
8702265,1,B00TLXIM6Q,"I can't play them!! The disks are not D.V.D compatible! I would give it no stars, But like usual, There is no option! I am so angry, I want a full refund right now! Ugh, I could not be any more furious. I love this series, And the fact that I have them and can't watch them, Is driving me up the walls! Don't buy it, They don't play on D.V.D!",1486771200,,342,3.8309859154929575
8702266,5,B00TLXIM6Q,Took long enough but the blu ray is finally here! One of the best animes i've seen. Please don't let people tell you not to get it because of the taboo/incest it's very beautifully done.,1485302400,9,186,4.3428571428571425
