1669497,5,B00005V1WQ,"Great deal!

Requiem for a dream is probably one of my favorite movies. I love the directors work, as well as in PI. If you enjoy movies for what they are, I suggest you get this pack. Like I said, best deal you are going to find!",1168300800,,230,3.893617021276596
1669498,4,B00005V1WQ,"Requiem For A Dream is pretty messed up. But that's kinda what makes it such a great movie because it shows two kids' lives just falling apart because of drug addiction and it's presented in a way that makes the viewer feel like they are getting a little wacked out too as the movie progresses. It's definitely not a family movie, but there is solid acting and stellar directing that make this film a must have for anyone who doesn't mind a dark, but entertaining movie.

Pi is good too. It's a little more ""artsy"" than RFAD, i.e. it's in black and white and there is a heavy emphasis on character development, so the movie doesn't have a whole lot of action, but it does deliver when it counts. The whole plot is just an interesting idea and it kept me intrigued the whole time. I'm not sure if this is one I would watch over and over though. Oh yeah, and the part with the brain on the stairs? I heard that it was actually a real brain...",1167782400,,940,4.251396648044692
1669499,5,B00005V1WQ,"if you don't mind depressing and weird movies I highly recommend this 2-pack.  REQUIEM will turn your smile upside down, but if you can handle a dose sadness where addiction is concerned, it is a great movie.  Just keep it away from the kiddies, as the brutality of the sex scenes is highly inappropriate.

PI is just an out there movie about a crazy mathmatician that has one of the best and most unique stories I have ever seen.  Like some people said, it is in b&w, but if you like artsy movies that are deeper than anything you will see at the multiplex, definintely buy this.",1142121600,2,580,4.392523364485982
1669500,5,B00005V1WQ,"Like PI this is another great film, but it is also a very depressing movie.  It was not as depressing as vanilla sky, but it was just a downer.  Jennifer Connelly is at it again showing her raw talent.

This film is about the descent of a select few people amd the forces around them.",1136592000,,284,4.127272727272727
1669501,5,B00005V1WQ,"I recently viewed the film Requiem for a dream and was extremely shocked. I have never seen a movie like this before in my life. A mix of sex, drugs, and vulgar language make Requiem for a dream not appropriate for a young audience, but i agree with many critics that this film should be viewed by every high school student. It teaches you about reality and how rough it can be when people start to do drugs. Everything is all good to begin with, but then there is a downside to it. No one has an endless amount of money to get drugs so in conclusion you must have to do something to recieve that money. Not everything in life is peachy keen, and some people are willing to do just about anything to aquire this drug money. Thats what makes this film almost like a slap in the face. You almost can't believe that you are seeing it. Your eyes widen and you may have to cover them. All i can say is Requiem for a Dream has made quite and impact on my life, because i learned things that i might have never learned. And i am only fourteen.",1075766400,15,1036,4.133663366336633
1669502,5,B00005V1WQ,"I watched this movie a while back, and it pops into my head when issues that the movie revolved around interlude into my life. I remember take D.A.R.E. when I was younger, and thinking that everything I was taught was worthless, then I watched this movie, and the entire plot and characters and emotion that is portrayed throughout the film had a giant impact on me.

1669503,5,B00005V1WQ,"my brother bought requiem for a dream a while ago and i watched it for the fourth time today. instead of just watching, i really thought about what was happening during the movie and i have never been as shocked by a movie as this one. requiem for a dream shows in plain reality what heroin and amphetamines can do to people and others around them, without glorifying them like trainspotting does. What makes this movie even more powerful is the fact that it can happen to anyone. this movie is like a scared-straight video.",1047081600,19,524,4.526315789473684
1669504,5,B00005V1WQ,"Requiem for a Dream is a directing masterpiece, and all four lead actors give impressive performances. Often directors make their movies confusing with too-frequent cuts, or distract from the emotional impact. But in this case the rapid cuts strengthen the emotional power of the movie, showing the parallel course of the four lead characters' stories, without creating any confusion.
Pi had elements of greatness, particularly in the directing. The paranoia, madness, and mathematical mumbo-jumbo in the story might not appeal to all viewers. (And some people just don't care for black and white.) But the real point isn't the story, it's the emotional effect of the directing. One thing that makes it an important movie is that it shows director Aronofsky's skill almost full-grown. The dirt-cheap credit card budget limited the director to a small story, but didn't keep him from showing directorial greatness. No wonder he got a real budget for his next film.",1040947200,15,963,5.219354838709678
1669505,5,B00005V1WQ,"I simply love this director. His style is so intense and forward that it's almost scary, but with each film here, he leaves you with a movie so powerful and unafraid of itself that you will never forget a single minute of it. They may shock you, they may frighten you, they may nauseate you, but they're never indulging, only giving you the truth. The descent of each movie is not glamorous, but it's bound to impact you. I recommend that even if you have never even heard of either of these, you should buy them both site-unseen. A great deal for such great movies!",1020729600,13,566,4.4
1669506,5,B00005V1WQ,"These are both fabulous movies giving us the world on drugs and the mathematical thriller. Both by Darren Aronofsky, these films rank on my top ten of greatest. Pi, filmed in black and white, explores the world of Max Cohen and his knowledge of the 216 digit number everyone wants. The ending is quite a shocker and wil stay in your head for days. The music accompanied by the movie is also quite powerful. Requiem for a Dream explores the rise and fall of four very similar people on drugs. Ellen Burstyn, who takes diet pills not knowing they are drugs, gives a knock out preformance and should have won best actress. Jared Leto i very real and powerful. Jennifer Connely bares from waist to bottom in an inspiring scene and also gives a powerful preformance. Marlon Wayans gives one if on his only great acting display. The quick cut shots and the fifteen minute ending, will also stay in your head. But the both of them. You will not regret it.",1012521600,16,948,4.517441860465116

It is very much like a true life documentary about all the actors lives during this period of time for them. I feel it can certainly make you put deep thought into actions you consider taking in your life and also look extra close at others lives your involved with. You should witness this film.

Pi : Classic film, it is ! Also a film that may bring depression to you. Mathematical stress example in my opinion. Made me reflect on how I had felt in (Late Game) Chess at times where the 64 squares just felt infinite. I could relate to the pressure . Great Drama film.",1398643200,,714,4.25

1669590,4,B00005V1WQ,"I really enjoyed watching the movie Pi.  I never took the math and the Kaballa aspects of the movie as facts but it was interesting how they were used in the movie.

The big problem with the movie Pi is that it is not anamorphic widescreen and will not play correctly on hi def widescreen TVs.  This movie has the top and bottom black bars encoded into the movie so on a widescreen TV it still plays with those bars on the screen.  The result is the movie appears on the screen with a black ""frame"" around the entire movie.  If you use a zoom feature the movie loses resolution and sometimes cuts off part of the picture.  As far as I can tell this movie was only released in the Letterbox version, although some descriptions of this movie are vague on that.  The two pack of Pi and another movie I bought are described as ""Anamorphic, Black & White, Color, NTSC.""  Only the other movie was anamorphic widescreen.  Pi, listed by itself, was described ""Letterbox"" as it should be.

If you have a widescreen TV be aware of the format before purchasing this movie.  I really like this movie but don't watch it often because of the Letterbox format.  Now I have two copies of it.  Oops.",1340668800,2,1182,4.36697247706422
1669591,5,B00005V1WQ,An all time classic of the new era. Outstanding interpretation and screen play. One of my favorite directors! Must have item!,1322697600,,125,5.0
1669592,5,B00005V1WQ,"While I personally prefer 'Pi' to 'Requiem For a Dream', there's no doubt both are strongly made,
challenging, highly influential films, by one of our bravest, most interesting film-makers.
And should you happen to have neither film, this is a chance to get both at a good price.
I do wish 'Pi' was anamorphic, but for now, this is what is available.

My thoughts on each:

'Pi' (5 stars) I don't know if this is as good as my rating, but it's so odd, brave,
idiosyncratic and haunting, that I want to forgive it it's flaws.

Made on a shoestring, but using those limitation to create a unique
look and style, this is a psychological thriller about paranoia and
ideas, that puts you inside the lead character's head as he slowly
cracks up, trying to figure out the mathematical basis of all life. He
gets mixed up with Hassidic Jews who think he may have found the true
name of god, and wall street traders who want his secret for riches.

Full of surreal touches, it's not always clear what's real and what's
in our lead character's head - but rather than being annoying, that
only pulls you in deeper.

To me it recalled great surreal earlier films
like ""Eraserhead"", and ""Seconds"", but on speed.

'Requiem for a Dream' (4 stars) Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full
of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good
(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).

But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm
ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,

Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really
getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction
is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those
themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with
the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of
depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.

Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.
By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the
top, and a bit illogical.

Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's
bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a
2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in
admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.",1303603200,2,2404,4.622065727699531

Since this is the existing discs, Pi is not anamorphic widescreen.  The Requiem disc is excellent, and it's the uncut version with all of the nifty bonus material (including the easter egg for Tappy Tibbons Rule #3).  But the fact that they just stuck the old Pi disc in there is bad.

1669612,5,B00005V1WQ,"A 'Requiem for a Dream' is about both a mother and son losing sight of their dreams.  They get pulled under by the pleasant advances of their addictions, and they forget who they once were.  It is a beautiful portrayal on others' reflections of reality at large.  It gives you a chance to put your feet in other peoples shoes and experience a 'dose' of the agony they face on a daily basis.  All of this so you can reflect their experience through your memory and perception without living in their own manufactured hell.  After seeing this movie I felt as if I had a better understanding of life.  I could see how we are all like moths to the flame, and happy in our own sympathetically imagined worlds.  This movie shows how a person can lose sight of their goals, if they stumble in their own addictions that only give them temporary happiness and release.

  'Pi' on the other hand is about a man who stumbles on the definition of God.  Max (main character) is an excessively private man that eats pain pills like they are candy, and studies the nature of the stock market from the privacy of his own home.  He is also a whiz with numbers and computers.  Although, he is very self righteous and doesn't like the attention that he gets from any one else.  After he predicts a couple stock standings, his computer crashes and acts as if it had a mind of its own.  Later on he finds out that his computer was trying to communicate with him, but he gets attacked before he can make any good use of it.

  Both of these movies are crafted very well, and give you the chance to understand the world through another persons eyes.  Beware with these movies though, because they will bring you down if you don't watch them with the right frame of mind.  These movies were made so you don't unknowingly fall into their slice of hell at full speed without any attempt to put your brakes on.  It's a sad life when you fall into your own addictions and blindly press on as if you didn't have a care in the world.  Every one is hooked on their own kind of medicine.  Whether it is anti-depressants, TV, books, or sports everyone defines and traps themselves by what they can't live without.  Although, some addictions are more healthy and fluid in order to mesh better with the dynamics of all life.  You just have to be able to identify the hinges as they are, and use control when the time is right, so your sobriety stays on top of things.  And these movies were made as a demonstration of that.",1178928000,12,2488,4.377729257641922
