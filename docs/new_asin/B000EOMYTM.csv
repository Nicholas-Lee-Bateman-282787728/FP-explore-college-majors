These all are special for me because I spent 40 years in Hollywood California, where I first met Rick in 1960, then became great friends for over 25 years. These are also special because I spent a lot time on the set watching filming of many shows. They bring back many fond memories of our times together, and although we both it has been nearly 50 years, Rick is still young in my mind and heart. Sam, his youngest son, is in the process of restoring all 435 episodes, and I look forward to when all are completed, If you go back to that age and time, you'll really enjoy all the available episodes.",1363564800,2,663,4.228346456692913
8111957,2,B000EOMYTM,"I returned this item unopened because I noticed that all of the episodes of the TV Show ""Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" in it were contained in the other product I purchased at the same time, ""Essential Ozzie & Harriet."" It would have been helpful if there had been a way to compare episode titles before purchase.",1196294400,7,316,4.56140350877193
