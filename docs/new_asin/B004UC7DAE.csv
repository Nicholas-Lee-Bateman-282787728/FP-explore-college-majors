The fact that Amazon is charging $295 definitely needs some serious answers!! Plus, it is printed on a DVD-R!! Was this movie simply not released on DVD?? What on earth are they trying to pull charging 295 dollars for it? There is no sense for anyone to pay that much for it. Heck, even $29.50 is too much, but at least it's somewhat acceptable. I'd definitely like to hear what answer there is for this.",1391644800,,529,4.408163265306122
8441403,5,B004UC7DAE,"Du Haibin's 1428 shows the devastation and horror of the Sichuan area after the Great Sichuan earthquake of May 12th 2008. Du visits directly after the earthquake and then again seven months following the tragedy. His film shows aspects of life that cannot be seen on network television. 1428 does a masterful job in showing both the scope of the tragedy as well as the tragedies on the most personal levels. 1428 is extremely gritty and well worth the watch, it will definitely show you a side of China that is rarely seen.",1303084800,2,524,4.645161290322581
