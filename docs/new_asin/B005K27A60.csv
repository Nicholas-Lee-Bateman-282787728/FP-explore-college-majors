8476419,5,B005K27A60,"Oh my Lord! (No pun intended!) Once in a while, albeit much too seldom, one finds oneself utterly blown away by a motion picture experience. It goes without saying that this is true for all genres, but pertaining to the horror genre, the last time I felt this overwhelmed by a work of the macabre has to be when I saw Brad Anderson's sublime Session 9 back in 2002, a film I still to this day rate as the greatest horror film of the 00s. So although it might be a bit early in the game, I coincidently feel as if I may very well have sampled the current decades title winner or at the very least, a close runner up. Yes ladies and gentlemen, Psalm 21 is that damn good.

The young priest Henrik Horneus (Jonas Malmsj&ouml;) is a modern preacher of the New Testament variety, whose interpretation of the good book is one of love and forgiveness - virtues he tries to bestow on the members of his congregation every Sunday morning, while smiling a little too hard for comfort.
In the midst of one of said sermons, he unwisely chooses to tackle his father Gabriel's (Per Ragnar) favorite psalm, the 21th from the book of David or ""Praise for Deliverance from the Enemy"" to be precise and from then on in, it's as if Henrik's path is somehow destined to take a turn for the harrowing and surreal.

Starting while consoling a tormented elderly member of his flock and coming to a head that very evening when confronted with the distressing news of his father's sudden passing, an understandingly distraught Henrik decides to drop everything at hand and venture out into the ominous wilderness his father called home, to further investigate the strange circumstances surrounding his death. It is here in these cold and merciless woods, with only the company of his father's grave followers in the form of the mysterious Lidman family, that he is forced to delve ever deeper into the painful events of utter darkness and dread that make up his own past and the unforgiving sins his Father has bestow upon him.

It's not often that I find myself completely lost for words after watching a movie, as more often than not there are different components that compromise the viewing experience, but nevertheless that's exactly how I felt after watching Fredrik Hiller's wildly ambitious and flawlessly executed feature film debut Psalm 21.
Never mind the fact that the film look like a million bucks, but to have the talent and ability to facture a virtually unblemished script and further execute it with this level of professionalism and conviction, substituted brilliance in my humble opinion.
Rumored to have had a budget of 800.000 Swedish kroner or about 80.000 which, if true, quite frankly boggles the mind, given that the technical aspects of the film are immaculate and wholly on par with any $20 million movie that constitutes low-budget filmmaking in Hollywood these days.
Shot on Red One by first time DP Andres Rignell, who handles the lighting of night and day scenes equally impressive and furthermore never seems to run out of steam in regards to creating interesting and original framings or compositions - a talent with a bright future indeed.

Great praise must likewise go to the effects team responsible for the, quite frankly, horrifying F/X of demonic presentiment on to the film's cast, both practical and digital. I've seldom encountered a more disturbing or frightening representation of hellish incarnations on screen, trickery that's greatly assisted by the director's decision to use it on already established characters (as opposed to unknown beings, jumping out of the dark) whom with a quick somber glance or subtle harrowing expression, forewarns that a dark entity is indeed lurking just beneath their crackling faade. This does wonders for the film's ever escalating sense of tension and the ability to conjure up a feeling of dread and unease in the viewing audience.

The ensemble cast of well established and veteran Swedish actors is nothing short of magnificent, but special mention must go to Jonas Malmsj&ouml; for his portrayal of the tormented soul Henrik Horneus. He excels throughout, conveying a wide variety of emotions onto the viewer without ever resorting to hyperbole or lame theatrical traits. Personally I'll be keeping a close eye on him in the future based solely on this masterful performance.

It's likewise a treat to witness the great performance by Bj&ouml;rn Bengtsson as Olli - the eldest son of the God fearing Lidman clan, and the terrific character actor Per Ragnar, whom horror fans might recognize from the beautiful coming of age story Let The Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008), who played the misguided ""father figure"" Hkan, whom, in the midst of one brief scene managed to install more malevolent menace into the demonic patriarch Gabriel than most screen actors administrates in their entire careers, playing limp bad guys.

Psalm 21 is, as mentioned before, an incredibly ambitious film that tackles grand existential themes such as the nature of evil, the origins of faith and free will contrasting religious belief as a higher power. Some might call pretension but that would be giving in to mediocrity and doing oneself a great disservice as an intelligent and profound horror film is indeed a rarity these days and need to be revered and celebrated as such, rather then dismissed and simplified by the obtuse members of our community.

Some readers might think that I've been a little vague in my overall description of the film, but this is merely a tactic, employed to best ensure that the potential viewer is as unspoiled and in the dark as possible to better help maximize the effects of the terror that await.

Fredrik Hiller has crafted an intelligent yet deeply disturbing psychological horror film about the pitfalls of religion, that will hopefully stand the test of time.

Hope you enjoy it.",1435449600,2,5869,4.907258064516129
8476420,5,B005K27A60,"For quite some time now, Hollywood has seemed quite content to plunder ideas from other countries and remake many of their superior horror movies. 2009's Psalm 21 from Sweden is undoubtedly ripe for the picking.

The passage from The Bible to which the title of the movie refers is very much dealing with a God of the Old Testament. Plenty of fire and wrath and destruction of evil-doers. Fertile ground for those looking for a foundation for their horror movie!

Firstly, allow me to comment on the special effects. As far as I'm concerned, they're top notch. CGI is not overused and the effects are there to enhance the story rather than being the centrepiece of the movie.
Jonas Malmsjo is the focal point of the movie as priest Henrik Horneus and carries this burden well while being ably supported by the rest of the small cast. There are some fairly predictable plot devices in this movie (priest with issues, mysterious family living in the woods, broken down car...) but keep in mind, it is a horror movie and some things require explanation before the film can progress any further!

I generally find the inclusion of religion in a horror movie is a little cliched and has been done to death within the genre. Not so with Psalm 21. This Swedish horror takes a slightly different direction, with the penultimate scenes being particularly powerful. The ending could be considered controversial by those with more conservative views but I would suggest that it is entirely in keeping with the tone of the movie and works very well, and suprisingly for a horror movie, delivers a strong moral message.

Some may be put off by the fact that this is a Swedish movie with English subtitles. If this is your attitude, then you're really missing out on a horror treat that I suspect Hollywood will simply create a soulless clone of. Do yourself a favour and see the original before this happens.

Actor Fredrik Hiller makes his writing, producing and directorial debut with Psalm 21 and does not disappoint, creating a solid horror story with a unique plot and a feel to the movie as if produced in a Hollywood studio although produced for around 75,000. I very much look forward to the anticipated 2012 release of Hiller's zombie horror Zon 261.

From the get-go, Psalm 21 is a creepy, creepy movie. So much so that I genuinely wish I hadn't watched it by myself. This very much put me in mind of how I felt when I watched The Woman in Black on TV when I was a kid. If like me, you can't really recall the last time you got more than a wee jump from a cheap scare in a horror movie, then Psalm 21 is for you.",1352764800,,2609,4.552238805970149
8476421,5,B005K27A60,"I had the opportunity to watch this film yesterday and finish it.
I had already watched a part of it before and liked it.
However , the ending surprised me.
The film presents a speech which will transform your perspective on the very meaning of the concept of Hell in ways no other film has succeeded to do to my knowledge , apart from perhaps the 1990's Faust Movie.
This film deals with the consequences of self - inflicted 'eternal damnation', which is really limited damnation , but only whereas 'the damned'limit themselves.
It reminds me of a painting of demons looking into the mirror while refusing to believe that is really who they are - refusing to face their inner natures.
The truth has no mask , by which it can hide it's actual appearance.
The message of this film is plain and clear; RELIGION CREATED HELL.
The official explanation for the creation of hell is divided generally in two sections - the one which deals with the man - made concept of Hell , but rarely has it offered except in the now myriad books on Satanism and the Left Hand Path and the tons of books on Mysticism already available as well as a long list of not so easily available treasures an opportunity for the viewer to present their case , for and against.
Much like in the overall but sad history of Psychiatric Literature.
This film , is for real.
This film , tells the truth - as it is.
It requires no religious symbolism , no religious or spiritual imagery at all to tell it - that is merely an addendum to add up to it's special effects.
And unlike most films which deal with the concept of a Christian's reflection of Hell , this film goes way beyound that - it shows you the actual meaning of what Hell can become like for you - if you're smart enough to get that.
This film is a Nietzchean epic masterpiece , one of the most Nietzchean film scripts I have ever confronted in my life , and in my opinion so far , the best Nihilistic horror film I have seen this year.
It can be viewed from two perspectives,

a) The perspective that a multiple dimensional reality is unavailable to the irreligious and to most people who do not wish to think about such things - and still explain the vitality of it's message. In that sense , Hell can be a very material place , as opposed to one of healing.
b) The perspective that there are no limits by how multidimensional intelligences can present themselves to the observer - in that case , Hell is merely a temporary state of being.
Think of Hell however in both cases , to be a temporary state of being - as well as death.
Think of every life you have ever lived and every dream you have ever had , as being a temporary state of being.
As of Psalm 21? It's already there...in the Bible , right in front of you.
But does it require you to read a book you don't want to read , or want to?
In case you haven't already read the Bible , the choise is your's.......

No I don't believe in a fundamentalist religious concept of Hell - I am absolutely convinced , that Hell is the place that heals our hurts.......
Hell is in that sense , a place of healing.
If people can't make sense of that , they better read Michael W. Ford's the Gates of Dozak to get their hands on a thorough and modern day interpretation of the meaning of the concept of Hell being a place of healing........

You don't have to make Hell in your life a place of needless and endless , mindless suffering unless of course you choose to.......
Guess I better go read Psalm 21 then......forward AND backward....",1327363200,,3512,4.310136157337368
8476422,1,B005K27A60,"It starts quite well. Good acting, excellent photography, catchy story start. However, as things go further, the story becomes more and more confussing, pretentious and senseless. When you reach half of the movie, you don't really care much about characters and situations, mainly because you're awfully bored. The only thing that I would rescue is the photography and the acting; the rest, you'd better forget it.",1321660800,,414,5.287878787878788
