2876086,4,B000RXZIHK,The workout is great for postnatal.  It is not too intense but enough that you feel it.  I like how you can choose what segments you want and do as long as you like.  You can go up to an hour but often I only want to workout for 30 minutes.  It i snot as intense as something like the ultimate workout but I feel it is great for working at getting your body back.,1204761600,,363,3.8
2876087,5,B000RXZIHK,"I previewed my dvd saturday night. This morning, after feeding my 11 week old at 5 am, I started the workout. Shellie does a great job at a good pace. This post-natal incorporates Taebo moves at a pace suitable for new mommies. I tried doing my old Taebo tapes but found it hard to keep up. This video is a great start to getting back to Taebo advance status. Thanks Shellie! See you again in the morning.",1203897600,18,405,4.2727272727272725

2876089,5,B000RXZIHK,"I got this dvd for my birthday and I tried it out today and LOVED it.  She works every inch of your body and she goes at a great pace.  She also explains all ofthe moves very well so that you know you're doing them correctly.  You can pick the segments of the workout that you want to do, but I was having so much fun I ended up doing the whole 50 minutes and time flew by.  Shelly also talks to you like you're right there, and just like her dad, Billy Blanks, she makes you feel like she really cares about you!  I HIGHLY recommend this workout!  I can't wait to do it tomorrow!",1201132800,15,580,3.956896551724138
2876090,4,B000RXZIHK,"I am actually still pregnant, and have only done the work-out twice so my review may be a bit premature :o) I do intend to use it as a postnatal work-out as well, but in the meantime, wanted something a little bit lower impact than the typical Tae Bo work-out and this fits the bill perfectly. It's an hour long, which may be considered a lot, but it is made up of 4 segments concentrating on different areas - upper body, lower body, core/abs and cardio - so you can mix and match the mini work-outs as you please. I consider myself pretty fit and found this challenging but low impact - so great for later stages of pregnancy as well as an early postnantal workout - as it is designed to be. I would recommend this product highly as a good work-out for the early postnantal months.",1198540800,6,783,4.297297297297297
2876091,4,B000RXZIHK,"Billy Blanks: Postnatal Power-Tea Bo workout lets you regain your body after the pregnancy. I felt comfortable with the tempo of the workout and motivated to loss my baby weight. Although, I would have liked for Shellie to include an advanced workout program as well.",1196467200,13,267,4.955555555555556
2876092,5,B000RXZIHK,I would have preferred just a little bit more focus on getting my belly back to it's former state but found that this was a great effort overall...,1294099200,,147,4.285714285714286
2876093,4,B000RXZIHK,"My daughter will be 9 months in a few days. Since I had a section, despite the okay from the doctor I was worried to start working out. I've always used Taebo to loose weight so thought it was worth a try & I'm happy. Easy to follow & not to tough. I just need the time a teething baby will allow me to do it more often",1290816000,,319,3.7058823529411766
2876094,5,B000RXZIHK,"I got this 12 weeks after having a baby. I am used to Tae Bo Cardio, and I like the familiar Tae Bo moves. You can play the entire 60 minutes or just do individual sections which are about 10 minutes each, which is perfect when you have a newborn.

I agree with the other reviewers who say that it's easy - but after giving birth, we need to be patient! Jumping into hard core exercise after labor can lead to lifetime issues with your body like joint pains. It's actually recommended that you wait 1 year before you start exercising like before. So I think the easy pace is actually good.

Shelly's instructions are easy to follow, perhaps even better than Billy since he tends to go too fast sometimes. I like her narration too, it's encouraging.",1289347200,,748,4.413043478260869
2876095,5,B000RXZIHK,"I bought this dvd a few months ago and was so impressed I bought more copies for friends because as my review heading says, it's not just for new moms.  And now i'm buying more to turn more people on to this dvd.

  I love Shellie's pace, her clear instructions and her attention to form.  It's a low impact yet thorough workout for those of us that have to be a little more careful with our moves yet still wanna sweat.
  I myself have knees that act up from time to time and I'm just really starting to ge back into my fitness routine in hope to take it up a notch.  The friends I've bought this for are dealing with various issues ranging from minor back issues, knees / other joint issues,  to just plain making the decision to get up off the couch.  But we do all have this in common: the desire to take charge of our health.  Also for those of you that want standing ab work, you will not be disappointed
  Please go out and buy this one ( after I get my copies of course )",1287100800,9,979,4.036458333333333
2876096,5,B000RXZIHK,"I am really enjoying the Postnatal Power Tae Bo Workout with Shellie.  My daughter is already 16 months old and it's taken me awhile to get back in the right frame of mind to even want to exercise again.  I'm 250 lbs., and even I can do this workout!  It makes me feel powerful.  I'm amazed that such simple moves can really work your muscles and make you sweat!  I would highly recommend this workout to any mom who has a lot of weight to lose because it just gets you moving.  I lost 70 pounds doing Tae Bo workouts before we conceived, so I know it works.  Love, love, love Tae Bo!  I especially love that Billy & Shellie are believers in our awesome God!",1280361600,7,658,4.166666666666667
2876097,5,B000RXZIHK,"I read the reviews on this dvd before doing the workout, and I have to say I completely disagree that it was too low in intensity. I used to do the Taebo Advanced workout before getting pregnant, and was moderately active through my pregnancy, gaining 30 pounds total, so not obese or anything. And this got my blood pumping and thighs burning!!
If you keep your stomach held the whole time and make sure your legs are bent low enough, I don't see how you couldn't burn by the end. It's an hour long and the cardio segment was awesome, definitely more than ""a walk around the block"" as one user put it. The ONLY thing I would change is a longer ab segment, or the ab work being on the ground as crunches, like in the advanced dvd from Billy Blanks. But all in all, I think it's great!",1273622400,3,784,4.233333333333333
2876098,5,B000RXZIHK,I have been using this DVD video for two weeks and all I can say is wow this is a workout! The fist time I used this my body was hurting all my muscles and muscles I didn't know I had was hurting. This tells me that this video will get the job done in my toning and losing this baby weight.,1271548800,,290,3.693548387096774
2876099,5,B000RXZIHK,"This is an excellent Tae Bo workout for new moms and/or busy moms.  It gives you the option of doing the whole workout at once (which I believe is sixty minutes long), or you can break it down and just do a ten minute workout.  You have the option of targeting certain areas (i.e. core, upper body, lower body, etc.), so you can build your own workout, which is great.",1268006400,,368,4.242857142857143
2876100,3,B000RXZIHK,"I've been a Tae Bo fan since the first video came out (1998). I was so excited to see a postnatal Tae Bo video but was a bit disappointed with the intensity, as I was expecting a typical tough Tae Bo workout. Shelly does a nice job with the videos (there are 4 that you can do separately or all together) but at 4 weeks post delivery and not working out other than walking for the last few months of pregnancy I wasn't very sore after doing the whole DVD the first time. It's probably a good toning DVD but not great for cardio.",1266796800,2,528,4.086538461538462
2876101,5,B000RXZIHK,"I really like this video. I have always done Tae Bo so I was a little worried that this would be pretty fast paced, but it is perfect for someone who hasn't done a ""real"" workout in nine months! I have been doing this video for about a week now and have noticed a huge difference, especially in my abs- I had my baby three weeks ago (easy delivery, no tearing and I did yoga every day when I was pregnant, so I felt like I could start working out again). It is nice that it is divided into sections also, so you can mix it up. I like to run on the treadmill and then do the abs and arms section and its a great total body regime. Definitely recommend to new moms.",1246320000,,663,3.955223880597015
2876102,4,B000RXZIHK,This work out dvd is not too bad. It really is for someone who is a beginner or just off of bed rest. I myself was just off of bed rest and I found this dvd very helpful. I even worked up a sweat! It did help me loose the baby weight. But again if you were working out hardcore before pregnancy or during than this dvd is not for you. All others this is a great post pregnancy work out.,1236384000,2,386,3.7777777777777777
2876103,3,B000RXZIHK,"i have loved tae bo for years so i was excited about trying this. keep in mind, i haven't 'worked out' in years and had just had a baby. i did wait the full six weeks to start exercising again, but i was surprised at how easy this video was for me. usually tae bo knocks me to my knees. this is great for getting your limbs moving and getting reconnected to your body but it truly is easy and i can't see that very many women would get a fat burning or muscle toning workout from it. i only used it a few times before i was ready to move up in intensity. you could maybe save money and just walk around the block and get the same intensity. it would be great for the woman who has never worked out, never done tae bo, is very very overweight, or is going to start on an exercise routine before six weeks post delivery. shelly is as sweet and supportive as ever and they all have lovely realistically fit bodies. and it's not very long, only about 40 minutes, so you can get in a full workout during your baby's nap. good luck!",1232582400,4,1026,4.059113300492611
2876104,3,B000RXZIHK,"I started using this DVD about 8 weeks after giving birth and for me it was way too low intensity. Shelley has two ladies helping her demonstrate and I thought it would have been great if she would have had one demonstrating a lower intensity than what she was doing and the other a higher intensity version...this is a strategy I've seen on many work-out videos and feel it is very worthwhile! I do like Shelley's personality and energy. With a little tweaking this DVD could be wonderful! All that said, if you are starting during your pregnancy or only a few weeks after giving birth...or if you were not very active before or during your pregnancy, this may be just right for you!",1231718400,4,684,4.524193548387097
2876105,5,B000RXZIHK,"I gave this 5 stars because: 1) it's simple and low-impact, but hand weights or resistance bands can be added for women who are more advanced;  2) it has chapters, so you can target certain areas, or do the entire video in a different order.
I'm 5 months pregnant and bought this video because it was getting hard to keep my balance through the Billy Blanks Boot Camp workouts (which I also love- been using that series for over a year).  I've been using resistance bands with this dvd for a more intense workout (my doc gave me the ok to lift weights because I was strength training pre-pregnancy).",1226966400,,599,4.486238532110092
2876106,5,B000RXZIHK,"I've been doing Tae Bo on and off for about ten years.  Every single time I switch workouts, I always come screaming back to Tae Bo.  It's the only workout that works for me.  I've lost inches, sculpted muscles and developed lean muscle and tone with the help of Tae Bo.  Shellie is an incredible instructor.  She's such a motivator and I found myself smiling and laughing throughout the workout.  She reminds us that we're tough!  We're moms, we can do anything and after labor, a workout is nothing in comparison, lol.

The workout itself is perfectly paced for those of us who are just starting to get back into a workout regimen.  It's not too fast and not too slow.  But most importantly the intensity level is just perfect.  You really work up a sweat without feeling like you're on your last legs.

Shellie explains each move and truly motivates you to finish each set without being too pushy or perky.  Each segment targets the typical post-pregnancy trouble spots, ie, hips, thighs, buns, as well as upperbody, abs and core.  The cardio section is a lot of fun and the tempo is just perfect.  Again, the intensity level is what I appreciated most.  You're pushed just enough to huff and puff, but not to the point of sheer exhaustion.  I really felt the effects after just one workout.  And I can honestly say, my abs, arms, and legs have never felt this thoroughly worked out, though I also dabble in power yoga, T-TAPP and various other cardio workouts on a regular basis.

This workout is definitely one of my favorites!",1224892800,5,1532,4.586715867158672
2876107,3,B000RXZIHK,"I purchased this not too long after my 3rd son was born, and although it was an enjoyable workout, I really didn't feel that it got my heartrate going.  I know the purpose of it is to gradually get your body back into the groove of working out, and it does a good job of that.  But I decided to just get back into running and that seemed to get me back to where I was before I got pregnant!",1224460800,4,390,3.8625
2876108,5,B000RXZIHK,"I really loved this workout not to hard for a new mom but challenging to help get back into shape. Its not fast like the other taebo workouts that billy does and I loved that I was worried it would be to fast for me and its not. It goes at a very nice steady pace for a new mom to get back into shape without hurting yourself.

2876109,4,B000RXZIHK,This product does work it helps with women who just have had babies its not to demanding. The sooner you start the better off you will be but always check with your doctor first before starting to excercise after have a baby. I love doing tae bo. Its fun!!,1211155200,,256,4.244897959183674
2876110,5,B000RXZIHK,I am a first time mother struggling to lose my baby weight.  I started using the post baby taebo and find that it's very encouraging.  The woman on the video have all had children and understand the difficulties that post mommies have in losing the weight and getting our bodies back to their original figures.  I would highly recommend this video to any new mommy.,1211068800,,365,4.584615384615384
2876111,3,B000RXZIHK,"This was a nice, easy workout that I started about 8 weeks post-partum (and I had a c-section).

8202945,5,B000RXZIHK,Have used it after two babies and I love it! It helps build those abs from square one unlike other workout videos. Post-natal is SO different it was nice to start at the very beginning.,1471392000,,185,4.314285714285714
8202946,5,B000RXZIHK,"Great post-pregnancy workout - not as hard as regular tae-bo, not too easy for a recovering pregnant lady.  Good challenges to get someone back on track.  I worked out every day before I gave birth and then took about three months off before starting again with this video and I thought it was perfect.  I would supplement with some other strength training exercises, yoga, and walking.",1466467200,,386,4.818181818181818
8202947,5,B000RXZIHK,"It is easier than I expected, but after a very difficult pregnancy and almost 2 years of no exercise, I find it perfect.  In all honesty I would not be able to do anything more strenuous and I did have to stop a few times for water. If you are used to working out regularly, this may not be the work out for you, but I was more than able to break a sweat, feel like I accomplished a good workout and was even sore the next day.",1435622400,,427,3.852272727272727
8202948,5,B000RXZIHK,"I have been doing the Tae-Bo videos for 12 years now so this is one of the first DVDs I purchased when I found out I was pregnant. I am 7 weeks post-baby now, and just got clearance from my doctor to begin working out again so I opened this up yesterday to give it a try. I didn't know much about Shelly from the Tae-Bo workouts, but she is AWESOME as the lead instructor in this workout. She was so personable, and - having given birth 10 weeks before recording the workout - knows exactly how we are feeling and offers adjustments to certain moves in case you aren't ready to do something yet. I was familiar with many of the moves from the Tae-Bo videos, but she walks you through them in case you haven't done one of their workouts before. You can either do each segment individually (I would estimate approximately 10 minutes each) or the whole workout for 60 minutes. If you aren't familiar with Tae-Bo, I would recommend doing the upper and lower body workouts first to get accustomed to the movements; many of the moves from those two segments are just sped up for the cardio portion, so it's important to get the correct form so you don't hurt yourself. Overall the workout kept my attention, got my heart rate up (my arms were so tired by the end!), and was still low-impact enough that I didn't feel like I was overdoing it. Highly recommend for all mommies!",1383782400,3,1369,4.393700787401575
8202949,4,B000RXZIHK,"This was just right for me six weeks after delivery. However, it only had one workout so I was bored after a few viewings. Billy Blanks is a favorite for me and his daughter was super supportive and positive throughout the video. I also liked that this was pretty even on both sides of the body (in some Billy B videos you have to mental track what he's had you do bc he sometimes skips doing the other side of your body). I felt like she was more organized.",1365552000,,458,4.157303370786517
8202950,4,B000RXZIHK,I like this video because it didn't have any jumping around which is annoying when your milkbags have any milk in them. It is a ligher workout them what I am used to from before baby but that is to be expected. You stand the whole time (no floor exercises). I wish I started using it right when my doctor released me. Too bad it is hard to get.,1357603200,2,344,4.0

The full workout takes an hour, but is broken up into managable sections so you have the option to target certain areas each day or utilize the full hour. I've been focusing on 25 minutes a day as I slowly get back into a good workout routine....and this dvd is perfect at taking it easy on your recovering body while still getting you to break a sweat and work your muscles.
