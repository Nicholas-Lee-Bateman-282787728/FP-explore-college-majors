8634047,4,B00HOP50DG,"Distributed for free with issue 155/August 2006 of UK heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer this DVD is a grab bag of official video clips from a range of bands. The title of 'Golden Gods' comes from the awards ceremony Metal Hammer used to run each year (heck maybe they still do!).

The bands/songs/videos are;

1) Bullet for my Valentine : 4 Words (To Choke Upon)
2) Lacuna Coil : Our Truth
3) Children of Bodom : Are You Dead Yet?
4) Dragonforce : Through the Fire and Flames

11) Clutch : Burning Beard
12) Bleeding Through : Kill to Believe
13) Engerica : The Smell
14) Moonspell : Finisterra
15) Scar Symmetry : The Illusionist

Peruse that list people and that's probably the best way of determining if you want this. Given so many clips find their way onto the internet nowadays one way or another it is debatable whether you really want to spend your hard earned on something like this. Particularly as the years progress and if you do decide you want it remember they came out for free in the first place so don't get gouged....

There are no extras here. No interviews. Nothing. Just the clips.",1408752000,,1267,4.424892703862661
