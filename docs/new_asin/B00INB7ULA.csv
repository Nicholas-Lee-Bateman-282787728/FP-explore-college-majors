8643565,3,B00INB7ULA,"Saw this on MHz's website and thought that, as a German program, would be worth view...as so few German mystery/crime programs are available in the U.S. There are six stories taken from  work by Ferdinand von Shirach, a notable defense lawyer from Berlin. von Shirach is the grandson of Baldar von Shirach, head of the Hilter Youth and later Gauleiter of Vienna during the Nazi era. The stories are from the younger von Shirach's experiences in law as taken from his very popular German book Verbrechen (or, Crime). von Shirach has since published two more volumes to equal success in the German speaking world. The six episodes here are all about 43 minutes long and each could stand alone and the later three episodes could justifiably be longer; their only ties being crimes have been committed and the lawyer Friedrich Leonhardt (convincingly and sympathetically played by Josef Bierbichler) to some degree figures in each one. As with all anthologies, the stories are uneven, episodes one through three, less interesting than the much better last three episodes. These are not like the typical American lawyer program where the sequence is: a crime committed, an investigation follows with various twists and conflicts followed by a trial and the bad guy convicted. Here the timeline hops back and forth, there is very little time spent in court (only in the very good episode ""Hedgehog,"") the defendants are not universally admirable, the victims sometimes almost deserve what they get (especially in ""Fahner"" about at wife-killing) and truth is almost relative. At the end of each episode, Leonhardt says that a lawyer does not always want to know what really happened. He only wants to look out for his client. If the first three episodes were as good as the last three, this would get a higher rating but there is one other problem. The fast clip editing does a disservice to viewers as, I think, more people would like to see the beautiful German settings. What's really aggravating is that, combined with the super-fast clip editing, is a hand held, ie., shaking, camera. I suppose the director feels that this gives a verisimilitude of real-time, real life. NO. It is a pain in the ass for viewers and seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the series. Antigone 34, also from MHz, suffers from the same irritating shaky camera syndrome. In German with adequate English subtitles. Unfortunately, Mhz makes English subtitles unremoveable. My guess is that, due to the success of the books, there will be another series or two on dvd but I would be reluctant to buy because the camera work is so aggravating.",1396828800,4,2619,4.938775510204081
