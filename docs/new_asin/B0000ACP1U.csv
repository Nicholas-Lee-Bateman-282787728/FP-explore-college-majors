7996693,4,B0000ACP1U,"This DVD has some of the most extreme brutal crowd violence I've ever seen which is a blast to watch.  You won't see this footage on a court tv special.  I've been interested in football hooligans for quite some time now.  I've read Bill Bufford's book Among the Thugs and it was something else to see events described in the book taking place before my eyes.  Being a yank who doesn't see this sort of sports violence very often, watching thousands of people swarm a football pitch gave me quite a rush.

I do wish they wouldn't have included the techno soundtrack.  It rarely lets up and I found it annoying and distracting.  It would have been so much better if they had included the audio from the riots and fights.

Also I would have appreciated a little more narration from Steve Jones.  While it's funny to watch him commentate from a toilet, he remains silent for the majority of the DVD.  Many times I was confused as to where the riots were taking place and who was involved.

Overrall though, this is a great DVD.  I've been in a riot myself once (San Bernardino, March '06) and while it's impossible to convey on the television the sheer adrenaline high you get while being part of a mob, this DVD comes very close.  I hope they release a second one, hopefully with footage from the 2006 World Cup.",1152835200,3,1310,4.453781512605042
