6748279,5,B00OGQUAU4,"ONE OF THE BEST WESTERN I HAVE SEEN,  THIS IS A DANISH WESTERN PRODUCTION YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, SEE THIS MOVIE YOU LIKE THIS WESTERN MOVIE..SALVATION...YOU WILL LIKE IT....TOO  !!!",1438992000,,184,4.71875
6748280,4,B00OGQUAU4,"Mads Mikkelsen and his brother are Danish soldiers who have immigrated to the West of the 1870s after the disastrous second Schleswig war, a struggle that ended with the Danish duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in German hands. Having built a home and farm on the dusty American wasteland,

War-weary after years of combat, the two men want only to be left alone to adapt to their new land. Unfortunately, the violence and corruption of the Old West offers hostile soil for the seeds of a new life.

Mads sends for his wife and young son to join him. The reunion is brief and unhappy: a pair of drunken outlaws commandeer the stagecoach carrying them to their new home, murder the boy and rape and kill the wife. Mads, takes his revenge -- which puts him in the crosshairs of a vicious and sadistic gunman who works for a shadowy oil combine that is trying to seize the land for its wells.

Revenge follows revenge and Mads ends up in a showdown with the gunman, his entire murderous crew and the mute wife of the original bandit who raped and killed his wife.

The film is definitely a revisionist yarn with a noir twist. The capitalists who are the behind-the-scenes villains get off scot free, the townspeople in the rickety ghost town are cowards who spurn Mikkelsen and turn him over the gunman, even though they know his death will surely follow. The local sheriff, a preacher, is spineless; the town's mayor is a crook on the payroll of the oil tycoons. The only possible justice for Mikkelson is at gunpoint, and Mads, burning with cold rage, is ready, willing and able to be its instrument.

Part ""Unforgiven,"" part ""High Noon,"" part ""Punisher,"" ""The Salvation"" is so hard-boiled you could slice it into potato salad. The film was made in South Africa but it's vast emptiness serves perfectly as a substitute for the America of the late 19th Century. You can seem to smell the dust and gunpowder, and almost feel the heat shimmering off the bubbling tar pools the capitalists covet. The cast is uniformly strong. Mikkelsen is perfect as a mild fellow whose life has been destroyed by evil men and who is intent on making all of them pay for it and Eva Green seethes with the emotion of a woman who has gone from being one type of prisoner to another.

If there is a weakness in the casting, it lies in having Jeffrey Dean Morgan play the gunman. He turns in his best Powers Boothe imitation, but accept no substitutes: if you've seen Boothe as Cy Tolliver in ""Deadwood,"" Curly Bill Brocius in ""Tombstone"" or Senator Roark in either of the Sin City films, you'll quickly realize his cocky, amoral arrogance would make the character Morgan plays much better.

This little bloodletter deserves a better fate than it got at the hands of its distributors. It was hardly in theaters long enough to notice and took a year to make its way to video release. This is a shame; it compares favorably to a lot of revisionist Westerns that have been released in recent years and is a hell of a lot better than films like ""Dawn Rider"" or ""Blackthorn.""

The low def version is available for rental through Amazon for $3.99 or can be purchased from Hulu.  I recommend it. Good westerns are hard to find and this one is definitely worth a look.",1438819200,5,3235,4.563793103448276
6748281,3,B00OGQUAU4,"""We've been hoping, praying that someone like you might come along to save us from our misery."" Jon (Mikkelsen) has been in America for many years when his wife and child finally arrive. What starts off as happiness turns terrible when two men he is sharing a stagecoach with do the unthinkable. After taking revenge Jon returns to his home to get ready to leave the town. When one of the men's brothers (Morgan) shows up he is forced to face his destiny. I was looking forward to this. I love westerns and there really hasn't been a really good one in a while. The cast alone made this one appealing. While this is not one of the best westerns I have seen it is one of the best in recent years. Mikkelsen does a good job of playing a man bent on revenge, but Jeffery Dean Morgan really steals the movie. He is a perfect choice for a rough and unlikable cowboy looking to exact revenge of his own. Western fans will like this OK, and Morgan turns in a movie stealing performance much like Kilmer did in Tombstone. Overall, an OK western that is worth seeing for the performance by Morgan if nothing else. I give this a B.",1429574400,28,1121,4.317535545023697
6748282,4,B00OGQUAU4,"""The Salvation"" (2014 release from Denmark; 92 min.) brings the story of Jon (played by Mads Mikkelsen). AS the movie opens, we are reminded that this is ""American, 1871"", and that Jon and his brother came over in 1864 after the Danish war, to start a new life. Jon and his brother are at the train station , awaiting the arrival of Jon's wife and young boy. Things go horribly wrong in the stage coach on their way to Jon's house, as two sadistic thugs brutally attack and kill Jon's wife and son. Jon is now out for revenge. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a Danish production all the way, as in: most of the crew that worked on this film is Danish, from director Kristian Levring all the way down. In other words, this is a Danish interpretation of what life in the rugged American West was like in those days. In the director's and photographer's mind, that apparently meant a very tough environment, barren and windy much of the time, with stark colors. Furthermore, this western was filmed in very southern South Africa. It all makes for an interesting 'cocktail' of a western. The biggest short-coming of this movie for me lies in the story (or the lack thereof): this is a revenge movie, with few words, literally: Eva Green (in the role of 'baddie' Madelaine) plays a mute woman whose gorgeous eyes do all the talking, and Mikkelsen is a man of few words as well, whose guns do all the talking (reminding me of Clint Eastwood, of course). The movie flashes by as if in a blaze of glory, to quote yet another western, and so in that sense it works well enough. Last but not least, I really enjoyed the orchestral score, composed by Kaspar Winding. Check out the lengthy acoustic guitar solo that plays over the movie's end titles, just brilliant (it gave me the chills).

I saw ""The Salvation"" this past weekend at the Silverspot Cinema in Naples, FL. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay. I can't imagine that this movie will play extensively in the theaters. If you are into westerns and don't mind the quasi non-stop violence and shootouts, this is certainly worth checking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1427068800,10,2305,4.565217391304348
6748303,4,B00OGQUAU4,"Bravo, Bravo!  Now that was a rugged, ruthless western that would have a gray-haired, senior clint eastwood shouting ""kill'em all.""  Just a great, no nonsense movie that walks the walk with its look, actions and minimal talk. Loved it!

He played a bad guy in Zorro, here he is the good guy.....and is wonderful in that role. Mikado Persbrant who,was Beorn as a giant shape changer in the great movie the Hobbit, plays the hero's brother.

6748333,5,B00OGQUAU4,"It's the usual western revenge thing but it's nice to see it from immigrants as it adds to the sense of unfairness that revenge films dish out.  Mikkelsen is great as always, Green is amazing and Morgan is everything you ever expect from him.  Although it does start a bit slow, it quickly leads to the cringy, unfairness you know westerns have and it does slow down a bit but it adds to that last moment of the film.

6748342,5,B00OGQUAU4,"I have stated in previous reviews that I like Westerns. When I saw that this was a Danish flavored Western I was hooked. Why? Because I am Danish. This is an artistic Western. The director uses filters to tint the color of the film in golden yellows and grey blues for the night scenes. A good Western needs a good bad guy and we have one here. When we first him, he kills an old lady, a legless man, and one husband for the hell of it. The hero is a Danish soldier whose wife and son are killed. He is a no nonsense man who has fought a war and knows how to kill in his own way.  I really hated the town people and felt that they got what they deserved.  Big shoot out is like the shoot out for Open Range, It is brutal and bloody. There is a woman here too and she stands out by not saying a word.
I can not leave with out noting the camera work of the director. He uses dolly shots and close ups. There are a lot of them and I found them interesting.  The music is sparse and it works well.  The ending... I am not sure how it really ends.",1478995200,,1042,3.8779342723004695

6748475,3,B00OGQUAU4,"I wanted to love this movie because I am a huge Mads Mikkelsen fan but I have to be honest on this one.  BTW huge spoiler alert.  This was a cast made in heaven and it could have been an exceptional movie if anyone had taken the time to relate to each other for even one minute.  I have to put the responsibility for this on the director of the film.  There was plenty of shooting, riding  and bloodletting, however, where was the romance, the human relationships, the connection that would have made us care about the movie?  Where was the passionate kiss from a man who had not seen his wife in 7 years?  We saw tears from the lead character, but where was the sobbing grief that would have made him take out a whole town in revenge?  Eva Green managed to emote to some degree, though she never spoke a word...but dramatic stares can only go so far.  I found myself comparing this to one of my favorite westerns, Pale Rider.  That is an example of a movie where relationships were built throughout the movie and you feel it all the way until the last ""Preacher, we love you"" echoes through the canyon and he rides into the sunset.  The Salvation did little to deliver that kind of experience for the audience.  Mads is still mesmerizing to look at, so all was not lost.",1462579200,,1271,4.3164556962025316

6748517,5,B00OGQUAU4,"I've been a fan of Mads Mikkelson since I first saw him in Casino Royale with Daniel Craig.  I am no less a fan after watching Salvation.  It is the classic Western theme of 'a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do', only this time it's Mads not John Wayne.  The film opens with Jon(mads) and his brother Peter meeting Jon's wife and 10 year old son after a 7 year separation.  All is well until they board the Stage that will take them home.  The two extra passengers are a salty looking pair with whiskey in their dusters and mayhem on their minds; and naturally one of them has a brother waiting. Horrific events ensue on the coach ride.
***Mild Spoilers***

The town is filled with the same sort of folks from many different Westerns, Open Range, Pale Rider and you get my drift.  The townies are too spineless to stop the sadistic madman who runs roughshod over them, even when all the men appear to have sidearms strapped on and tied down.  Even Eva Greene who plays the new widow and is basically wasted in the movie, is armed. Her problem is she's a 'mute' and must do all her emoting with looks and unfortunately all of her looks look pretty much the same.[You have to watch the movie to understand why she's mute]  Still, her's is only a small sub-plot to the grand theme of 'an eye for an eye' revenge and the rough 'justice' of the old West.

While I am not a purest, those of you who are will immediately spot that we aren't in Kansas or Texas or even AZ, nope, it's Africa, and assorted places 'over there'.  So...no Monument Valley, no red rocks no western landscapes as we know it, but I can live with that, though some purist's might not.  Then  what makes this a 5-star Western you ask....read on.

This movie gets 5 stars from me because of the actors and their performances! All the male leads are strong 'alpha-male' archetypes driven to do what's necessary!  Each and every one brought their A-game to Salvation, and it's a joy to watch as each character is fleshed out, made real and allows us to feel something for them, whither loathing or fellow-feeling and understanding.  So, is this a great Western, no, it is not, but it's a damn good one and if you like to step back into the days of our wild west heritage do so knowing you won't be disappointed by The Salvation!",1457308800,,2294,4.375
6748518,1,B00OGQUAU4,"I watched the whole movie to see how ridiculous it ended.  It was gloomy and the protagonist had a blank face the whole way through, not to mention miraculous healing powers. BORING! There was no plot.  There was a hint at the beginning that indicated it was going to be dumb when the antagonist wanted two people to kill because his brother and one of his men were killed so he wanted blood for blood.  An old lady volunteered and as the rotten devil approached to shoot her in the head, no one behind her scattered, they just stood there.  SPOILER: The protagonist ended up taking the lot of 'em and of course wiped 'em out.  There was a particularly silly part to set up a predictable ending.  One of the bad guys got stuck in the eye with a hunting knife, then shot, then the protagonist stepped out in the clear to finish him off with a knife, which got him shot.  There's no way he would have exposed himself, but it was wrote that way to set up the stupid ending.  So the antagonist would look like he had him dead to rights, then his former woman he turned out shot him.  Wow, what a surprise.  The blank faced protagonist and the gal road out of town together spontaneously.  The guy's shoulder shot and all.",1456963200,,1217,4.317180616740088

6748533,4,B00OGQUAU4,"Four BLOODY Stars! ""The Salvation"" is a grisly movie about love, greed, revenge, odd alliances, and Danish families in 1870s western North America. Starring two of the baddest movie guys in recent years: Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Extant, and Negan in TV's The Walking Dead), as well as Eva Green (Penny Dreadful), Eric Cantona as ""Corsican"" (Switch, You and the Night), and Jonathan Pryce (the first 3 Pirates of the Carribean movies). There are some remarkable scenes and personages in this movie: a wife threatened by outlaws in front of her family on a stagecoach, a ""princess"" rescued from savages who cut out her tongue, a pastor acting
 as lawman, a bad guy who 'doubles down' to avenge his brother's death, and a rare mineral.  Not for the faint of heart. Directed by Kristien Levering.

6748567,4,B00OGQUAU4,"This is one of the best modern westerns that I've seen in a long time.  Mads Mikkelsen does his best ""Squint"" Eastwood imitation by muttering few words and letting his expressions and actions tell his story.  The lovely Eva Green isn't so lovely playing  her character since her backstory involves being kidnapped and mutilated by Indians prior to marrying into the wrong outlaw mob.  You may recognize/remember Eva from her parts as a Bond Girl and appearing as the main character in ""Penny Dreadful"".  Having her tongue cut out by the Indians resulted in her communication being limited to facial expressions, something that this accomplished actress does quite well.

The plot is well thought out and presented, the western scenery is beautiful but harsh, and the brutality towards the towns-people is a bit over-the-top -- but there are reasons for this. It appears that the main bad guy (played by Jeffery Dean Morgan) was recently an accomplished Indian fighter, is now in a unique position of power, and he treats everyone in his fiefdom with the same violent passion.  Only one person among the towns-people has the courage and ability to sort out right from wrong, but his actions take him deeper into a trap where there appears to be no way out.  Fortunately his brother gives him the opportunity to get the upper hand and seek retribution,  to destroy the brutal reign of the outlaws, and to free the non-speaking but still beautiful Eva Green.

Rather than ruin your viewing experience by telling you how everything comes together, and give you spoilers that will help you understand the reasons for all this violence, let me just say that everything makes sense at the end.  This is not a pretty story.  However this movie tells the tale of greed and violence that is still relevant to this day. Superbly under-acted by a great cast.",1447113600,,1846,4.843949044585988

Eastwood has done better on many occasions with that ""weak towns folk"" set up.  Anyway I love Mads but this flic cant beat Rio Lobo or Rio Grande with Wayne.

Here Jon has been waiting to be reunited with his wife and son after a seven year gap. Only as soon as they arrive they befall a terrible crime and the only way Jon is going to be able to re right the wrong is by fighting back.

Now to say any more could be a plot spoiler - needless to say this is a classic western of the revenge genre. It paints the bad guys really bad and the good guys flawed but essentially `right'. There is ambiguity too and there are the townsfolk with their own agendas and greed and power stalking the prairie.

What makes this outstanding is the acting, the musical score, the make up and the fantastic direction. Director Kristian Levring is clearly a fan of John Ford and those of you who know your westerns will see a few shots framed a la `The Searchers'.

This is an example of what true artists can do with smaller casts, great scenery, and good writing.  This is a damn good story, plain and simple.  The kind of story that leaves you wanting to know more about the characters, and sad that movies can only be so long.

Watch it.  It's right up there with Slow West, Echoes of War, 3:10 to Yuma, True Grit, and Appaloosa.",1441324800,,645,4.619469026548672

6748705,3,B00OGQUAU4,"With a genre as saturated as the American western, it can be difficult to reinvigerate the brand. This film manages to do just that. Or does it? Revolving around the timeless and satisfying dynamic of the ""revenge tale"", the movie runs in a fairly predictable pattern. The real character, and the real appeal of the film comes through in some spectacular cinemetography and visual effects. Detail has never been so looked after. From the costumes to the weapons to the set design, one never feels incomplete immersion. Casting was a pleasant surprise here. Mikkelsen plays his lead in the same sincere and intense manner that he always does. And there in may lie the secret here. The entire film smacks of a quiet desperation and some grim certainties that underscore frontier life in the western territories. All in all, there is little to detract from the action, save for the tired and ever staling idea that fossil fuel is the downfall of civilization. See There Will be Blood, etc. All in all, the film was well acted and nicely shot. Definitely worth a look, and must have on Blu-Ray or other HD format.",1440979200,,1109,4.751295336787565

It makes you boil with pain and anger and sympathy for the protagonist who loses in the most vicious ways his ten year old son and wife to a just released couple of ex-cons. Throughout the film, which is shot beautifully much like a piece of art work, you see the constant forces of good and evil fighting to survive.
