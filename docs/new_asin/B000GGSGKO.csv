8132014,5,B000GGSGKO,This is a very innocent older style Bollywood movie and it's fun to watch for its total lack of polish. SRK is very sweet and watchable as always.,1405555200,,146,4.25
8132015,4,B000GGSGKO,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid and I still love it ... It's like the Indian version of ""Annie""",1363996800,,107,3.6956521739130435
8132016,5,B000GGSGKO,My daughter & I saw this movie and Anne and she really enjoyed the kids movie and she (purchased for her 5th birthday) recommends to others her age and their parents who enjoy good kids/family movies to watch.  The print clearly is dated from early 1990s as oppose to movies 20 years later in High Def but this movie is worth watching as a family.,1337990400,,347,4.338461538461538
8132017,4,B000GGSGKO,"I bought this because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. This story has some elements which remind me a little of the Broadway musical ""Annie"". I liked the scenes when Shah Rukh Khan was in the film. I missed seeing Shah Rukh Khan during the big chunks of time he was not in the scenes. This film is worth getting if you are a serious fan of Shah Rukh Khan.",1334880000,,352,3.9027777777777777
