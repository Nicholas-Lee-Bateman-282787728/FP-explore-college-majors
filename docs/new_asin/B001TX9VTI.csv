8342410,5,B001TX9VTI,"""La Zona"" was an eye-opener for me. A gated, highly-secured community in Mexico City is the venue for this masterful view of the walls that separate different strata in our society. Physical walls - but also walls that we construct in our minds. ""Profiling"" is the current terminology for our modern world's paranoia of anyone that doesn't fit into our safe, secure model of ""us"". Extrapolate the goings-on in this community to the world-at-large and one can see what we have created - a monstrous world-view of fear, greed, mistrust and paranoia. A brilliantly conceived and executed film - and extremely disturbing. For further investigation into this phenomenon, watch ""Das Experiment"" - the ultimate depiction of paranoiac insanity (based on an actual university experiment!)",1348012800,,779,5.290322580645161

In the confusion, an old lady is killed, but a young housemaid escapes and warns the security guards. The guards shoot two of the robbers, but the third escapes and remains hidden inside The Zone.
