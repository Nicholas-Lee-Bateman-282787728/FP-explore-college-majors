8288287,5,B00005JCCO,"If you are into wakeboarding on any level, buy this DVD! You'll love the zany antics of Shaft and the rider commentary in Shafted. Plus, you'll get to see Watson, Shapiro, Murray, Parks, and others at their very best. High points include Murray on the Skurfer and the bonus skateboarding and snowboarding sections. Shaft/Shafted will keep you going from beginning to end with a rocking soundtrack and the best wakeboarding action on the planet!",1023667200,,444,5.013513513513513
