296686,3,6300269280,"Disapointed love turns Paul from a hard-working idealist to a cagey brown-noser on the make.  Can defending his one-armed, dipso buddy realign his priorities in a town where straight-laced bluebloods call the shots?  Find out in this slick, but not overaught 50s melodrama.  Robert Vaughn as the disapated playboy is very good and Paul gives an energetic performance -- in the courtroom scenes it's fun to imagine you're watching the young Frances X. Galvin before his fall.  (And just try to watch his climactic courtroom takedown of Richard Deacon with a straight face.)  There's a fun academic commentary as well.",1198281600,7,616,5.12

296689,4,6300269280,"In Warners' ""The Young Philadelphians,"" Newman plays a young lawyer who abandons all values in search of success... Directed by Vincent Sherman, who had made some of Joan Crawford's tough career-woman vehicles, this slick soap opera actually finds Newman in a Crawford role...

Tony Lawrence is born into poverty, and his mother brings him up to believe that social position, good contacts and money are all that matter... At first he resists, but events harden him into a cynical opportunist, and he sets out on an amoral journey to the top of his law firm... He double-crosses, romances and ingratiates himself to success, but loses all his youthful idealism, and becomes unhappy with himself... Finally deciding that success isn't worth, the price, he chooses integrity, risking the enmity of a prominent family by defending an alcoholic friend...

Tony, the ruthless opportunist, is superficially another Ben Quick (""The Long, Hot Summer""), but here the writing is superficially and Newman responds with an appropriately routine portrayal... He goes through the motions well, conveying the smiling, eager innocent at the beginning, and the intense, jaded conniver later on... But it's all on the surface, with no depth of feeling... Tony doesn't even have the underlying devilish charm, only an attractive face... And at crucial moments--when Tony's girl marries another man and when he finds out who his real father is--Newman falls back on heavy breathing, rapid blinking and feverish lip movements...

Barbara Rush gives her best performance as the depressed, cynical, high society daughter of one of Philadelphia's most prominent attorney Gilbert Dickson (John Williams).

Robert Vaughn is excellent as the alcoholic victim, cheated and inherited...

Billia Burke is delightful as the old millionairess whom Tony wins her trust by persuading her to transfer the administration of her possessions to a firm that could save her 'some' taxes...

""The Young Philadelphians"" is Vincent Sherman's best film of the fifties, with excellent supporting cast specially by Alexis Smith as the dissatisfied wife of an aging lawyer collaborating in unifying the arguments of the dramatic action...

With 3 Academy Award Nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Vaughn), Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, the film is gleamingly done and acted with assurance...",1168905600,27,2362,5.437158469945355
296690,5,6300269280,"I read this book years ago.  Movies tend to fall short of good novels because they are too limited in what they can cover.  But this movie does quite well.  In the book there were three generations of Irish.  The hero's grandmother is the immigrant who got the family to America.  Next Tony (the hero) gets a key block in the getting ahead game when his second generation mother finds a crack in society's door but doesn't quite get in herself.  But she keeps her foot in the door in that commitment to the future that our immigrant ancesters had that has done many of us a lot of good.  Her commitment put Tony in a position to belong IF he can graduate from the right school and prove himself in a Society level law firm.
Tony and his mother get behind the scenes help from Tony's real father a successful and politically connected Phila contractor who sounds an awful lot like the famous John Kelly (Grace Kelly's Grandfather).  Once again the Irish immigrant class are working with a commitment to the future of their people and their family. The real father sees to it that Tony can afford Princeton and law school.  And Dad keeps Tony's mother's secret.  They even keep it from Tony himself.
Tony does some bad things. He gets suckered by his sweetheart's father when the lovers decide to marry before Tony has his law degree.  So he loses the girl.  Next he steals a a plum summer job out from under one of his college buddies to advance his own career.
Next Tony does some good things.  His super influential summer employer's young wife thinks she is in love with Tony.  Tony actually turns her down while making her feel good about the whole thing.  He's learning to think on his back as well as his feet.  And he uses his inherited Irish blarney to great effect.
Next he saves his old Princeton Buddy from a murder rap, earning the undying gratitude of a socially very important main line family.  His original girl friend, good looking and also well connected, marries Tony after her husband is killed in Korea.  She wanted him even though she thought he was a sell out.  But when she watches him battle his way through a tough criminal rap, in a high risk situation, out of loyalty to his old pal, she stands with a look of admiration and says something like ""you are the man.  I'm yours for ever""
At that point I was wishing that I was Tony.",1073692800,13,2355,4.432558139534883
296691,5,6300269280,"...is a copy of this movie.
A fifties black and white classic, this movie is everything movies used to be, but, sadly, are not today.
Who's Paul Newman?  Sure, he's devastatingly handsome and burns up the screen as Tony, but it's Robert Vaughn who steals the show.  His character, Chester, is riveting and achingly fleshed.  1959 Vaughn in a white dinner jacket...and the jail cell scene takes my breath away every time.
The soul of the movie is good triumping over evil, even if it takes good a while to get there.  The meandering path the two heroes take on their journey to personal salvation makes us examine our own life choices.
You'll feel better about the human condition (not to mention lawyers) after watching this movie.",1070668800,7,731,4.732283464566929
296692,4,6300269280,"A steamy ""Peyton Place"" style sex story, featuring Paul Newman as Tony Lawrence, an ambitous young man whose soul is twisted by his aristocratic family's unwillingness to let him marry for love.  Forced to play the power game, he plays it to the hilt, cynically using his sex appeal and ruthlessness to bring ruin to anyone standing in his path.  I'm sure they must have toned the film script down quite a bit from what the book was like, but it's still pretty raw.  Plus, Newman was one sexy monkey when he was young... if you wanna see him at his shirtless, hunky best, then this is the film for you.",1041897600,2,602,4.405405405405405

297056,5,6300269280,"Good Film.  Alfred Eaton,(Paul Newman), aspires to achieve wealth and social acceptance. that eluded his Mother and Grandmother.  However, personal weakness as well as the flagrant daliances of his wife Mary result in his downfall. It is a theme as old as the Greeks.(Oedipus Rex) to William Golding,(Lord of the Flies) to Sartre, (NO Exit), among many. We also get a glimpse of the unwritten social graces that are employed by old money to discriminate against those who work paycheck to paycheck.  The novel by John O'Hara is 1100 pages in length. It is sectioned in 4 parts.  The first the life of Mary, Alfred's great Grandmother, the second his Grandmother, the third his mother and finally the last part (about 300 pages) is of Alfred's life.  The film deals with only the 4th part.  For other reading pick up a copy of Ayn Rand's novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" (not available in film).  She teaches that the profits from industrial endeavors belong exclusively to the capitalists.  You can then see the Conservative movements hand in the Great Depression.

Ambition met with brilliance born from the Society mom and secret Irish Immigrant Dad and a work ethic long lost on today's movies and life, Anthony Lawrence ( Paul Newman) succeeds in keeping his character and integrity intact and finds "" I am not at as good as I thought and I'm not as bad as I thought I was. "" successfully defending his life time friend and terribly damaged Korean War Veteran, in a murder trial.
A not so subtle scene of Anthony's (Newman) becoming a tax law specialist led me to becoming one the top CFP's in CA.

This movie follows the undercurrents of high society in stuffy Philadelphia and builds upon the foibles of just about every character. Paul Newman's character faces a number of life conflicts through the film. His personal journey is chronicled from his college days through his successful career. I thought all of the actors in this movie played their characters well. The story is engaging and interesting. What's sort of odd, though, is that the promotional cover of the film (the man and woman in a hot embrace and Newman without his shirt) are barely part of the whole plot. I guess the steamy scenes ""sell"" better than the real story of the movie--which is the challenge of integrity, friendship, success, and redemption.",1415404800,2,804,4.833333333333333

297758,4,6300269280,"Tonight I watched an incredible stage performance of AFRICAN QUEEN at Laguna Woods, CA, with Barbara Rush (really in her mid-80s? looking about 42)...even greater than she is in this somewhat staccato (and very dated) tale of geneerational trauma involving upper crust Philadelphians in the period just after WW2 and the end of Korea.

Newman and Rush play sophisticates at least 10 years younger than their true ages; Newman's Mom has fake gray in her coiff; Robert Vaughn - the soon to be Man From U.N.C.L.E. is the kid with potential who sees deeply...unfortunately, also, a little too deeply..into his scotch tumbler. He looks pretty much within age-range of his role.

It takes quite a while for the under-stated under-achiever of the new Lawyers to really get the plot in gear. Not to give away his catapult into real maturity..against the Newman and Rush descent into confusion and stagnation.

The latter two partiers prove to be the *most* vulnerable. But will Paul regain his confidence after falling for a secondhand bit of legal-career legerdermain by Rush's aristocratic Dad?

A terrific script and black and white photography. But where was Louis Calhern?",1342310400,,1169,5.104712041884817

Paul Newman scorches the screen in bringing this film to life and only because of him does it live. His costars do a GREAT job supporting his superb work in this film.

297825,4,6300269280,"Don't let the title fool you, this B&W film is a campy treasure, and well worth the rental on the cast alone. For starters, the opening scene with the newlywed Adam West going into an emotional breakdown and dashing out of his bridal suite in despair is PRICELESS. The opening title sequence, which consists of an excellent music theme over stark and simple high-contrast animated graphics, is also wonderful.

The affable Paul Newman, who seems right at home in any era, anchors the film as the young attorney Anthony Lawrence (he portrays a man in his early 20's, but when the film was made he was actually 35!). His love interest, played by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Rush -- I couldn't take my eyes off her! Wow, what a luscious woman!

Robert Vaughn is melodramatic and charismatic as Lawrence's troubled best friend; Otto Kruger and John Williams are refreshingly stuffy and avuncular as Lawrence's legal mentors, and the courtroom scene, with Richard Deacon as an arrogant butler testifying on the stand, is indispensable for Deacon fans.

This film reveals a world more obsessed with status, social class, and family names than we are today. It seems very odd, but I guess it was a reflection of the times. I'm not sure times have changed all that much. You can be the judge. This is a wonderful movie.",1289433600,3,1316,4.788546255506608

297829,4,6300269280,"As a native Philadelphian, I found this movie supremely entertaining. For openers, the ""Main Line"" as alluded to throughout the film is not actually in Philadelphia. Rather, it was and is in the Western suburbs of Philadelphia...towns along the ""main line"" of the former Pennsylvania Railroad (now used by Amtrak and the Septa Regional Rail). These would include Villanova, Paoli, Swarthmore, Haverford, Radnor, etc. All very upscale and socially desireable communities. Rittenhouse Square (the opening when the wedding takes place) is in Center City Philadelphia. Also ritzy, but not Main Line. South Philadelphia is...well, South Philadelphia. The stereotypes are well-drawn, quite full of themselves and very over the top. Then again, maybe the rich really are that different. The acting is great, the stereotypes entertaining and the story quite enjoyable.
