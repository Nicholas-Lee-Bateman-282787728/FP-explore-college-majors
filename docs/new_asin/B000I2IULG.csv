8143589,5,B000I2IULG,"Caballe and Carreras gave this concert as a benefit, which is nothing new to either of them.  Blessed be the many beneficiaries of their altruism, as money will flow in!  As much as I enjoy hearing and seeing them, I enjoyed almost as much the obvious appreciation of the Russian audience.  In the USA, such demonstrations of appreciation are generally reserved for rock stars.

As other reviewers noted, the concert is given by two artists with a history.  Part of the enjoyment is recalling when I first heard the pieces, the context, and the feeling that the two artists are reliving their memories as well.  I loved it!

09-02-09 Update: Since I mentioned context in the earlier version of this review, I may as well follow through with it.  Context is more significant than even I realized.  At the time of my first viewing of this DVD, I had been listening to a lot of Caballe and Carreras, especially material recorded in the 1970s.  Silly me for comparing them to themselves--their younger selves, at that.  This morning, for some reason, I dropped this disc into the player.  Having listened to a lot of other singers for the past few days, I found this concert to be a revelation.  Notwithstanding Caballe being 56 years old and Carreras just clean from leukemia, these two were damned good in 1989, especially when compared to the hotdogs of today.

Give the singers time to warm up--this being almost half-way through the program.  Go for the sentiment, and imagine the two Catalans channeling Casals in their touching rendition of El Cant Dels Ocells (#13 on the program), a song of great national significance to Catalunya.  (Carreras once said, ""Allow me to be a good Catalan, and I will be a better Spaniard."")

For me, a particular pleasure was watching and hearing the pianist I can only refer to as The Great Zannetti.  This was special for me during Granados's La Maja y el Ruisenor (#21 on the program).  In this, we have the famous partnership of yore: Caballe and Zannetti as a piano/soprano duo, rather than a pianist accompanying a soprano.  This is characteristic of Granados.  Caballe's appreciation of  Zannetti's solos throughout this piece are visible.  She applauds him at the end.

Carreras was wonderful during the second half of this program.  Enjoy him!",1248220800,4,2288,4.820051413881748
8143590,5,B000I2IULG,"See, and especially listen to, these two Spanish opera stars passed their prime, but still wonderful enough to show that most recent ""stars"" are nothing but an embarrasing marketing product. Worth listening for everybody, indispensable for opera lovers.",1222387200,7,253,5.684210526315789
