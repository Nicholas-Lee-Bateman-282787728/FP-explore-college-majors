8543425,4,B004QXKHF0,"I think it is so refreshing to see a series like this. Characters are varied and human in their hopes and dreams and disappointments.  There is no ""over the top"" expectation of life just an honest attempt to live it the best one can.",1523836800,,233,4.295454545454546
8543426,5,B004QXKHF0,"I enjoyed season 2, catching up with old friends and seeing Janet married. Note that in episode 1, there is male back and side nudity; you can pretty much see everything. And the context of murder is not what you would usually expect from the show. All of the actors are in fine form and give a good depiction of life in late 1940 postwar Scotland",1521072000,,347,4.2727272727272725
8543427,4,B004QXKHF0,"It is always a treat to see Ian Bannen and Annette Crosbie in anything.  The scenery is gorgeous and so are the settings - the old vintage appliance, clothes, etc.  Nice stories that show the humanity and neighborliness of people in small rural areas.  No gratuitous sex or profanity - just entertainment.",1520035200,2,305,4.826923076923077
8543428,4,B004QXKHF0,"This is a weird series. The main actor, David Rintoul is very stiff. Perhaps he is best described as being from the Kristen Stewart school of acting. He is an AC..TOR (I will now smile, now I will show sorrow, and now I will deliver my lines as a sonnet.) You might at this point ask why I gave this series 4 stars. The rest of the cast is sterling! The locations are beautiful and awe inspiring.
One last quirk to mention: the sub plots never have a resolution, so the characters we learn about are dropped along the way. It wasn't a waste of time to watch, but odd.",1519516800,3,567,4.163636363636364
8543429,5,B004QXKHF0,This series is a delight and reminds me of all that is good about British shows complex real flawed wonderful people in the most wonderful scenery living daily lives that feels authenticate.  Life was once more close to the essentials than it is for most of us now.  I want more!,1518825600,,279,4.450980392156863
8543430,5,B004QXKHF0,Excellent acting and stories!  I hope Acorn provides seasons 3 and 4 soon.,1518652800,2,74,4.6923076923076925
8543431,4,B004QXKHF0,Very well acted.  These episodes remind us that our parents and grandparents coped courageously with a completely different life.  They were daily tested to survive in very difficult times.  Our lives are luxury and ease in comparison with what they had to deal.  It is healthful to recall the past and learn from it.  It is very possible that we will not always have our current luxuries to lift us and shall have times of hardship just as these.  How shall we deal with them?  Shall we have the same courage that our old ones showed?,1518480000,,535,4.510416666666667
8543432,1,B004QXKHF0,It was made in England I couldn't watch it here in the U S,1495411200,,58,3.2142857142857144
