8383482,1,B002X0MZDK,I'm about to purchase The Three Stooges Collection and so far I am finding that it will be significantly cheaper to purchase each volume separately thru Amazon at this time :-),1278374400,,176,4.709677419354839
8383483,5,B002X0MZDK,The dvd collection was insured and I could check on its shipping progress online with USPS.,1268006400,,91,4.75
8383484,5,B002X0MZDK,"I have always loved the Stooges, all of them:  Curly, Larry, Moe, Shemp, Joe and Curly Joe.  This set is fantastic and in historical order.  I think that if you look at the personal lives of the boys and what they produced, it would be wrong to stop at Shemp's tour of duty with the Stooges.  Please continue with Joe and Curly Joe and please include the movies.  I would recommend this set for everyone.",1265414400,2,404,4.333333333333333

8383486,5,B002X0MZDK,"This was a Christmas gift. I attempted to buy this set in the stores, but it did not come as a ""set"" and the 7th DVD was not available. Plus, when I added up the cost of each individual DVD and the cost for the set through Amazon, I was $12 ahead with my Amazon purchase.",1262995200,,271,3.857142857142857
