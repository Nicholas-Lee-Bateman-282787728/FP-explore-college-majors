5559792,5,B00B6DTEX4,Love the extras! Never a dull moment with these.,1409011200,,48,4.444444444444445
5559793,4,B00B6DTEX4,"While there is no nudity, the focus of the fan service and the situations around it would make this suitable for audiences 17+.

It's 2 episodes.  If you own the complete first season DVD, you'll need these two episodes (OVAs) in order to actually have the complete first season.  The DVD/Blue Ray combo pack should include these two episodes so only buy this if you already have the DVD.

The first OVA progresses the story line a bit and is worth having.  The second episode is just silliness intended to show cute girls in skimpy outfits.  What prevents this from being 5 stars is Kampfer takes you almost where you want to be, but is censored.  There is no uncensored version available.",1403568000,,690,4.60655737704918
5559794,5,B00B6DTEX4,Awesome and really funny I just wish their was a second season rather than two ova's cause the story is pretty good.,1402704000,,116,4.318181818181818
5559795,3,B00B6DTEX4,A 2 disk OVA set.  Seems like just bits and pieces from the series story line put out to wet your interest in getting the series.,1394841600,,129,3.9615384615384617
5559796,4,B00B6DTEX4,"This OVA set has two ova episodes which is cool. I went ahead and watched it and just as I watched the original released full series Sentai put out earlier without this OVA set, I was laughing practically nonstop. I would recommend re-watching the series incase you've forgotten certain characters or enjoyed the laugh.",1378339200,,319,4.925925925925926
5559797,1,B00B6DTEX4,"Not gonna lie -- ""Kampfer: Fur Die Liebe"" was a huge disappointment. The original 13-episode Kampfer TV series was no masterpiece, but it was a fun and capable little anime. It had a wacky premise, nice artwork, some decent action scenes, a lot of very funny awkwardness (romantic or otherwise), and an endearing cast. Natsuru, Akane, Suzuka, Mikoto, Sakura, and their gruesome stuffed-animal minions were loaded with personality, and getting to know them was a fun romp. The original also featured plenty of ""fanservice,"" but it was dispensed evenly enough that it usually worked in conjunction with the plot (such as it was) and with the humor. Kampfer also managed to end on a fairly strong note, which is something that very few anime can boast. I was looking forward to this sequel, but... oy.

The problem is honestly the fanservice. I'm a straight dude who appreciates the stuff, but it's like cologne -- throw too much on, and everything starts to stink. The first of the two OVAs on this disk is almost an exact repeat of Kampfer's penultimate episode (#12), but with any sense of tension replaced with toilet humor or cheesecake shots. The second involves a part-time job and group date where Natsuru winds up having to be in two places (and as two people) at once. The idea has comedic merit, but it only takes up about 5 minutes of the 25-minute episode, and the rest get taken up by nekkid lesbian antics. Unless you're absolutely starved for fanservice that is constant and overwhelming (without once being visually explicit), I can't imagine you'll find much to like about either episode. Depending on how the writers wanted to handle it, ""Fur Die Liebe"" could have been sexy, funny, dramatic, or romantic; it ends up being none of the above. The whole affair is a 50-minute exercise in bad taste and missed opportunities. About the only positive thing I can say about it is that they didn't completely destroy the characterization, even if they did hypersexualize it into a caricature at points.

That leads to the final nail in the coffin: ""Fur Die Liebe"" is not an especially good value as a product. Unlike most OVAs, the animation quality here is no better than the TV series, and it might be worse. And the whole doo-dad is less than a single hour long! Ending this review, I have to add that I do appreciate Sentai Filmworks bringing it over from a completionist standpoint and don't fault their side of things. The subtitling and video quality are excellent, and they didn't orchestrate this disaster; they just translated it. I just wish Kampfer's creators had either planned a better-after party or known when to call it a night.",1374105600,3,2654,4.792576419213974
5559798,5,B00B6DTEX4,"The previous positive reviews well describe this OVA for this product for a public mostly male.  Thus, I'll just add that now the series makes an usual turn from most harem type series where the girls start looking for options instead of clinging to a single guy. It doesn't seem that they will get too far, but it's something new meanwhile.
The original classification of the manga source was ""shonen"" or for male teenagers, but it's a comic thus I still enjoy a lot. A person can have fun at any age so long as we don't worry about labels.
Again, it'll only spoken in Japanese, this needs to be very clearly stated for much of the public.",1374019200,,640,4.423728813559322
5559799,2,B00B6DTEX4,"I normally don't give negative reviews but I was really disappointed with this DVD.  The animation was good, no complaints there.  It was the story line, it was so weak that it made it impossible to watch.  I was so disappointed with the story that I never finished watching it, and I am an avid movie watcher; so that's saying a lot.",1372896000,,334,4.354838709677419
5559800,4,B00B6DTEX4,"This Kampfer OVA made up of two episodes which the first story picks up the morning following the White Kampfer battle episode in the other Kampfer DVD set.  The first OVA story deals with White Kampfer plot of revenge after what had happened the previous night and previous DVD set. Once again it up to Red and Blue Kampfers working together.

The 2nd OVA adventure deals with Natsuru starting to think like a girl and wanting an adorable bra that cost a bit more money. Natsuru takes a job at the Bunny girl cafe to afford the bra but when his male self goes on a double date the school student president has funny making Natsuru running back and fourth to the booth in both male Natsuru date form and female Natsuru waitress form.",1368835200,5,733,4.462686567164179
5559801,4,B00B6DTEX4,"The adventures of Natsuru the hottest guy/girl continue in these two new episodes.  Poor Natsuru thought after all this time, he would be used to being a boy/girl, but when his female attibutes grow to big for her underwear, she takes a job at a new cafe  with AMane, hoping to earn enough money to buy new bras.  However when the cafe is hosting a school mixer - lead by the sadistic school president, poor Natsuru is pulling double body duty trying to host and work at the same time.  Add a locker and some nosy co-workers and watch the clothes fly.  BUt of course the White Kapfers are still gunning for both red and blue, so Natsuru and Amane are invited to move in with the Red Kamfers, for mutual defense and survival.  Nothing could possibly be suspicious.....right????

Overall the two episodes add to the Kampfer universe and bring on more of the same hijinks from the full series.  Still teen rateing, though the ecchi level is very high.  I hope this is a bridge to being out a full new series and finally put to rest all the questions from the emd for the first series.",1361145600,7,1081,4.41919191919192

8563268,2,B00B6DTEX4,"Only 2 episodes and when watching it it was obviously not like an OVA or anything as the ""last"" episode was supposed to be about the protagonist's friend but never really even gave her screen time.

It also abruptly ends at a weird part indicating there was supposed to be a follow up, there's also no real ending for the animated series.

Doing some reading and research it appears there's low popularity for this series in the west so it did not get completed.",1447200000,,462,4.488095238095238
8563269,5,B00B6DTEX4,These two OVA's were worth every cent I spent to buy them the first of which continues upon the story along with giving a good amount of fan service for those Siziku X Natsuru fans. Then the second episode only reinforced my desire to watch more with the ending line mentioning to what Shiziku shall do to him next,1441238400,,314,4.338983050847458
