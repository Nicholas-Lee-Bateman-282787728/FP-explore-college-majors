8510218,4,B0074UHHGE,"this is the eighth dvd i have bought of grandes pealas series. I love boxing more than any other sport! almost more than any thing in life. I collect anything boxing Dvds,books, and autographs. Before the collapse of the housing market i would buy pay per veiws and had subscriptions to H.B.O. and Showtime. Saturdays were jammed packed with boxing. I would also watch fights on Fox,versus,Espn and any other network that would show them. Now since i work construction and the housing market is very flat i only make a third of what i did during the housing boom. I can no longger afford H.B.O. or Showtime. Nor can afford Cable. Now with Grandes pealas i can still watch Boxing. I might have to wait a couple months after the fight to see it on dvd but it is better than nothing. Antonio Margarito vs Miguel Cotto 2 was one of the fights i was wanting to see but couldn't afford. This D.V.D. made it happen for me. Miguel Cotto is one of my favorites. He is amazing. He can fight like Joe frazier and can Box like Sugar Ray Leonard. Whatever he chooses. Great left hook and he can throw about any type or variation of the hook. it is a thing of brutal beauty. The fight is high Quality and in English commentary. I would rate it 5 stars if it gave the fighter intoductions and didn't cut out the corner work. other than that you pretty much get to see the complete fights not just highlights like alot of boxing D.V.D.s.... The other fights on here are entertaining with Canelo,Chavez,Manfredo,Citron, and Arce. The fight with arce is listed as against angoly but it is against Wilfredo Vasquez jr. instead. the headliner is Foreman v.s. Ali the RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE. I didn't care because i own this fight on three other D.V.D.s but it is the only fight in Spanish wich i do not understand all that well...........This is a great find for fight fans.",1336780800,,1852,4.466076696165191
