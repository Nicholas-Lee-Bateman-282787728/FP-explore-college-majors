I LOVE sanrio characters,I remember always having pencils or stationary sets with my melody on them in the late 70's. This amine brings back such fond memories,and even if it has no subtitles,the story is very easy to figure out. Very enjoyable to watch,even my 12 year old loved it!! Highly recommended for all Sanrio fans,and My Melody fans like myself!!",1209945600,,435,4.891891891891892
