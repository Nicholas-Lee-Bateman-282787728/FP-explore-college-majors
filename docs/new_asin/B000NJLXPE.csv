8178403,5,B000NJLXPE,"I like this DVD because I visited the same destinations on my boat. One of the highlights of this presentation is the music written and performed by John Williams, who is also the captain and the boat owner. For me, the mix of pictures and music is really good and unique. Over the years I watched the disc several times and, especially because of the excellent music, I still enjoy it.",1497052800,,386,4.450704225352113

8178405,1,B000NJLXPE,"i was looking forward to receiving the dvd in order to be instructed in sailing around this area.  however, after purchasing and viewing it i found that it was not an instrustional dvd.  in fact, it had little commentary on the actual sailing, not even mentioning the particulars about the craft being sailed.  it mostly talked about passing shipping and a little on the dry land places visited.",1428192000,,395,4.779411764705882
8178406,1,B000NJLXPE,"Being a resident and avid sailor of Puget Sound, I thought this video would be of interest. I would really like to say there was at least one good quality to this video but, I just can't. Very poor filming technique (home video style). Not one spec of information can be gleaned from the travels of the crew. Nearly all of the video was filmed by hand, standing in the cockpit looking forward over the deck of the boat...OH LOOK, A BUOY!!! Seriously, this is the highlight of the film.

This film is what it would be like to sail with the McKenzie brothers on their fist sailboat ride. Obviously not locals, miss-pronouncing names of harbors and bodies of water these guys are just out for a day sail and happened to have a VHS camcorder that was mistakenly left in record mode.

To add to the misfortune of the boredom, the same music track plays over and over throughout the entire film.",1336262400,11,889,4.447852760736196
