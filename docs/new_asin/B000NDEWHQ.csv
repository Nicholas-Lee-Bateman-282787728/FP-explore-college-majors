There is absolutely no way you can not learn to Waltz!  There is music to practice to for each step and detailed tips I cant imagine finding anywhere else!  My husband and I are learning to dance with grace, style, and confidence.  Dancing together around the living room has been so much fun.

2764856,5,B000NDEWHQ,"My husband and I have been learning to dance, all different styles of dance. We bought this video and it's been non-stop waltzing in our house. I was a bit nervous and a little intimidated at first. You know, doing the waltz is not like just ""shaking my groove thing"", it takes learning and practice. This video answered many of my questions. After watching the video, I really loosened up. I felt like a princess. We've been gliding around our dining room ever since! I DEFINITELY recommend this video! - Jill",1201651200,7,510,4.615384615384615

2764888,4,B000NDEWHQ,"I like that the DVD shows the steps from both the male, and female point of view, then together before adding in music. It slowly adds to a routine step by step. During my review I think it's very easy to follow, and pick up on. The only thing that would make it better is to have a professional there letting you know for sure if you're positioned correctly.",1418947200,,359,4.217391304347826

2764890,4,B000NDEWHQ,This is a step by step video on learning to Waltz. It is easy for the clumsy and layman to learn to be graceful on their feet.,1418774400,,126,3.7037037037037037
2764891,5,B000NDEWHQ,"I received Waltz Volume 1 to review. I need to mention that this is Volume 1, and you'll learn the basic Waltz steps, but for more advanced dances, like the Twinkle, you must purchase Volume 2. I only mention this because the Twinkle is in the description, but not on this DVD volume. But what you will learn are the Box, the Turning Box, the Box with Walkaround Turn, and the Progressive Basic.

The instructors are super-friendly, and I have to add, super-graceful. They start each dance section with a demonstration, then go through the Men's Breakdown, the Women's Breakdown, show it then danced together, then danced to music. They do this for the 4 Waltz variations you'll learn.

Don't be intimidated, they show you everything you'll need to know to look as graceful dancing as they do. They show the footwork, timing, the rise & fall, and the swaying necessary to complete the dance in style, and they'll show you each separately, and demonstrate multiple times.

There is a chapter for each of the 4 dance variants for the Waltz, but there are additional chapters that cover other aspects in detail: Footwork and Rise & Fall, Exercises, Tips, Waltz Social vs. Competitive, and Etiquette.

You will learn how to hold your partner, how to lead and guide (men), how to follow (ladies), what frame you would use on a social ballroom floor vs. what you would use in a competition, how to ask someone to dance (men), or if you're tired, how to politely refuse (ladies). They give tips on how to politely warn your partner of an impending crash instead of shouting (ladies), how to avoid a collision with another couple (men), and so much more.

I love that they go into so much detail, and give you plenty of instruction in repetition. It keeps you from having to grab the remote every few minutes to rewind.

They have portions of the dance Picture in Picture, so that you can see the whole dance, but you can also watch just the footwork in an inset box. They show you each dance from multiple angles so that you can follow along however is comfortable for you. If you've ever tried to reverse-mirror someone on a workout video and failed, this is for you (and me, lol.)

I loved this video. I have wanted to learn how to Waltz since I was a little girl playing Princess! I feel confident enough to get out on a dance floor now and do the basic steps. I wish I would have found this before my wedding! I know it would have made the day so much more special.",1418774400,2,2462,4.506726457399103
2764892,5,B000NDEWHQ,"I have always wanted to learn how to waltz. I always found it interesting. This dvd shows all the basic steps , for beginners to intermediate. I have been having fun with this one. My husband see's the dvd going in the player and he runs , lol. I have been driving him nuts with it. Easy to follow instructions and I have fun while learning at the same time.",1418688000,,358,4.128571428571429
2764893,4,B000NDEWHQ,"I received this dvd in exchange for an honest review.

Before watching and dancing along to this video, I had absolutely no experience with waltz aside from what I've seen in movies. I knew there was a strong element of etiquette and properness to this dance but I was still surprised to find a large chunk of the DVD focused around proper waltz etiquette. I found this portion of the DVD incredibly amusing.  I am not one to follow along with the normal rules of society so reviewing this DVD has definitely reminded me I am too much of a rebel to be dancing the waltz in high society any time soon.

Regardless, I did enjoy the DVD and it will be fun to continue to learn waltz just for something to do. I found waltz more difficult and challenging than other dances which is probably just what I need. There is a lot more to think about with all of the rising and swaying. The heel to toe movements adds some difficulty to this dance which I hadn't expected, and I found it gave a pretty good workout on my weak ankles. I also found it very interesting to learn about the different kinds of waltz.

The instructions are clear, and I feel fairly easy for beginners to follow along. If you're not very coordinated as I am, you may have to skip back a few times to review instructions a few times until you get the hang of it. (I did!)",1418688000,,1335,4.264822134387352
2764894,5,B000NDEWHQ,"The Waltz first became a dance during the 16th Century and continues to be one of the most popular dances today. If you're not a dancer, like me, then you've probably don't know too much about the Waltz, except for what we have seen in the movies and on Dancing With The Stars.

DanceCrazy.com has been releasing dancing workouts to DVD for several years. I've been trying out the Beginning Waltz: A Step-By-Step Guide! Volume 1 for the last few weeks. The 63-minute DVD features a male and a female instructors, whom guides you step-by-step through the basic Waltz steps.

The DVD is broken down into these sections:

The Box Step

Rise & Fall

Turning Box

Box with Walkaround Turn

Progressive Basics

Tips, Exercises & Extras

I would like to start out by saying that I have two left feet with no dancing background, so I don't ever expect to be dancing like Fred Astaire. The production for this DVD is simple with a only two instructors, a dance floor that resembles the linoleum floor in my basement and a yellowish curtain in the background. This could be an off point for some viewers, but I'm here to learn how to dance and not to watch a blockbuster film. The instructors do a pretty good job giving step-by-step instructions; ones that even I can understand. Overall, Beginning Waltz: A Step-By-Step Guide! Volume 1 is a fun easy way to learn how to Waltz. It would make a great stocking stuffer for Christmas!

I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",1418342400,2,1514,4.615671641791045
2764895,5,B000NDEWHQ,What an amazing gift! My husband & I learned to dance for our anniversary. Easy to use & wonderful-even if you're not a good dancer like us! We love this & would recommend it to all couples.,1418342400,,190,4.162162162162162
2764896,5,B000NDEWHQ,"Would definitely recommend this especially if you have a busy schedule and a dance class won't fit.  This is something that you can move the furniture back and begin.  It got my hubby and I off our butts and moving.  We spent about half an hour the first night and we were doing the box step together and giggling,  It made it feel like we were dating again.  We were trying something new and different but it also allowed us to do so at our own pace and when we had the time.  Another advantage to this is if you aren't really into crowds or learning new things in front of a crowd of strangers (or even friends) this allows you to learn even if your partner isn't around to practice with you.  Give it a try and make sure you wear your dancing shoes.  Once you start, you don't want to stop.
I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.",1417564800,,984,4.281081081081081
8176804,3,B000NDEWHQ,"I wasn't impressed with this album.  The ""Ballroom Dancing Basics"" album, in my opinion, was more helpful and still easy to follow.",1456185600,,131,4.954545454545454
8176805,5,B000NDEWHQ,"Great teaching DVD!! I had a horrible experience learning to waltz for an event in high school ages ago, and I was never much of a dancer. This has helped me get over that and prepare for dancing with my daughter at her wedding.  The instruction is repeated from numerous angles and broken down for each part of the waltz ( box, turning, moving across the floor, how the dancers bodies ""rise and fall"") and within the sections are his and her steps, the couple together with instruction, then the couple dancing to music, clear and detailed each in its own chapter on the DVD so you can watch the desired part over and over easily. This has been incredible helpful  and confidence building as we both learn to waltz. After getting my copy and starting to learn with my wife; I bought our daughter her own copy so we can each practice at home learning everything exactly the same before we practice together.  Be sure to watch the tips and extras, beyond just information about ballroom dancing etiquette, there are gems like how the woman lets her partner know he's dancing back into someone, how to recover a missed step (at least helpful for me the never danced much person). If you are great at dancing, can pick up moves watching others on the dance floor and close enough in form and style is ok you might not need this. If you want great confidence building instruction, and/or want to learn the correct form and style get this DVD! Thanks Dance Crazy I am really enjoying learning the waltz.",1450656000,,1498,4.54074074074074
8176806,5,B000NDEWHQ,"loved the discs - went to a wedding oversea last week - used the disc to practice, wanted to make sure we could waltz-named the best dancers on the floor!

8176807,5,B000NDEWHQ,I LOVE THIS DVD. GETS ME UP AND MOVING AND IS TEACHING ME THIS GREAT DANCE. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.,1439510400,,154,4.166666666666667
8176808,5,B000NDEWHQ,"The Waltz is a beautiful dance. I read the history of its origination and by the standards of society back then, it was considered risque and caused quite an uproar. Now by our standards it's considered more proper and full of etiquette - even stuffy! But it has a lot of grace and style and Dance Crazy's Beginner's Waltz DVD is an excellent introduction. It is a 90-minute step-by-step guide that teaches all the basics. Just like their other dance DVD's, this one is easy to understand and before I knew it, I had all the basics down. It doesn't feel like a regular ""class"" because it's so much fun. Would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to Waltz in the comfort of their own home. I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.",1437609600,,833,4.4868421052631575
8176809,5,B000NDEWHQ,SO much fun! super easy and a great couples activity!,1420675200,,53,4.4
8176810,5,B000NDEWHQ,"Love to watch Dancing With The Stars and wonder how they learn to dance like that?  Well of course it is hard work and they do it quickly in a matter of weeks.  But you CAN learn how to dance the Waltz at your own speed and from the privacy of your home.  This DVD will teach you all the basic steps and then help you learn how to put them together from experts.  They show you the steps in a very easy way, so even those of us with NO dance experience at all can learn and this will actually take you to a pretty advanced level.  And unlike taking classes once a week or so you can watch this as many times as you want to make sure you get those steps perfect!  Check out their other DVDs while you are picking up this one - they have Swing, Merengue, Salsa and much more!  Definitely a great program for learning how to dance many styles :)  I received a complimentary product to test.",1420416000,,887,4.0285714285714285
8176811,4,B000NDEWHQ,"I feel like I am very dance challenged so I was very excited to try Beginner Waltz dvd. I went to the menu-then scene selection and picked one movement at a time. Once you pick a movement (like The Box Step for example), then you have the options to learn the step with the demo, mens breakdown, womens breakdown, dance men/women together, and dance together with music. The instructors are VERY clear and easy to follow. They show you the steps from a couple angles, as well as the different breakdowns mentioned above. The background and music are very calming during the dvd-I highly recommend this beginner Learn to Dance set!

What a romantic date to do with you spouse or a fun way to exercise!",1420416000,,700,4.555555555555555
8176812,5,B000NDEWHQ,So I will be honest. I didn't get this because I wanted to learn how to dance. I got it because I want to loose weight. I caught on with this dance pretty quick. It explains exactly what to do step by step. I have now been using the DVD for a month and I've lost 6 pounds. I received this product for free in exchange for my review.,1420070400,2,332,3.8260869565217392
8176813,4,B000NDEWHQ,I love the classic dances. I am sure when I am done with these lessons I will be more comfortable dancing with my husband at weddings and such. I love how detailed they are in the instructions. They really break the dance down and make it super easy to understand. I love the short lessons. We used this as a date night.,1419897600,,320,4.17741935483871
