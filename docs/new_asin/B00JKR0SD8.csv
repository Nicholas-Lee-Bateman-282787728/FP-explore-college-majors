8651873,5,B00JKR0SD8,"Caught part of the conversation on TCM and knew I wanted to see the entire show.  Mr. Osborne's comments at the beginning of the prime time shown movies adds so much enjoyment to the movie being commented on.  It is too bad he can't present a commentary on each and every TCM movie showing.  For me, a lifelong fan of TCM and classic movies, having an insight to events that occurred during both the making of a movie and its' stars adds invaluable viewing enjoyment.  If and when he leaves the host chair, it will be a tremendous loss to both TCM and us fans.  Glad he himself could be the star of such a program and receive such well deserved accolades.",1446336000,,655,4.336065573770492
8651874,5,B00JKR0SD8,"An excellent collection of DVDs comprising Mr Osborne's experiences going back many years in Hollywood. It is interesting, entertaining and informative. If anyone enjoys the old Hollywood movies, the old Hollywood stars, this DVD set is exactly what you're looking for.",1433721600,,269,5.585365853658536
