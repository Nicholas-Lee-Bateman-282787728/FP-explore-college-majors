8640488,5,B00IAR2BL6,"I am a high school science teacher.  I purchased this DVD for my students after seeing the program on TV.  My students loved it!  Not only does this documentary emphasize that animals should not be considered as ""throw away"" pets, it also highlighted how prosthetics  are made, how the work done with animals can help humans and their challenges, how animals can impact people's lives and that each life is important.  It is amazing to see the change in an animal's demeanor when it is fitted with a prosthetic.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1436486400,,547,4.705263157894737
