Not too much to say about this one. It's pretty much the same as those ""scary movies"", ""date movie"", ""epic movie"" types. This is a simple minded dumb movie aimed at young teenagers, and it contains alot of sexual jokes. I don't know how this revolution started with the raunchy sex jokes (maybe American pie), but it really isn't funny. At one point the butter fingers quarterback (Matthew Lawrence) is trying to grab a girls breast. When did that become funny? Sure, I would love to squeeze some breast myself, but not for laughter. Other innapriate jokes include the rival team popping out of a giant condom before the game, and 2 female cheerleaders kissing.

There are several good cameo's from Dennis Rodman, (WWE DIVA) Stacey Keibler, and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed).",1193097600,3,955,4.817073170731708

In your face slapstick comedy. I liked the way ""Rocky"" disintegrated in the boxing ring! A great watch when your laugh reserves are running low. Not for kids, as the suggestive content is more suited for adults. If you are looking for a film to critique, look further. If you want a movie to laugh at and not analyze, this one should work fine.

3053361,4,B0010X8NFK,"I love sports movies.  Good, bad, or indifferent.  The Comebacks is no doubt made by people who share the same passion.  Other than perhaps Brian's Song, this movie lampoons every other football movie ever made (and many other sports movies).  The list is impressive; this is what I saw on the first run:

Radio
Invincible
The Longest Yard
Lucas
Field of Dreams
Friday Night Lights
Wildcats
Rudy
Gridiron Gang
Waterboy
Necessary Roughness
Remember the Titans
Bend it Like Beckham
Mighty Ducks
Dodgeball
Rocky
Hoosiers
Drumline
Coach Carter

The fun in watching this movie lies not in the performances or the script - even if you've never seen the movie you already know it from beginning to end - the joy is that each ridiculous clich is lovingly embraced and then turned on its head (the only one that didn't work was the insertion of Frank Caliendo and his tired impersonations).  Included with the clichs is an great cast and an awesome number of cameos from Stacy Keibler, Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, and Bradley Cooper.  As absurd as this sounds, The Combacks is perfect for not just sports and dumb comedy fans, but all movie-goers.  With tons of homoerotic references (that somehow don't distract) that many see in football, and a three-way love triangle there is something for every fan.  If that's not enough to bring everyone together, then Journey will surely unite us all.  Don't stop believin', it worked for the Untouchables.

3053362,2,B0010X8NFK,"A spoof movie, another product of current stupefying lampoons for a sub-genre heading into the wrong direction.  A spoof is usually defined as a composition that imitates or misrepresents somebody's style, usually in a humorous way.  Therefore, if such composition has no humor to deliver, then the very point of the movie has been self-defeated.  The problem: slapstick.  It seems as though whenever a parody is made, somebody has to get hit by something.  Hear are the highlights of ""The Comebacks"": a football player getting ran over by a bus, and then gets crippled by a cashew, a mentally-challenged inspiration trips from his shopping cart and dry-humps the teacher (isn't ""Radio"" a parody in itself?), a 90-year-old Balboa-ish character got punched and turned into dust, and the running gag of people getting pummeled by opposing football players even when they're not on the field; heck, the movie even went to absurd extremes like in the ""Dodgeball"" parody when the coach shoots a nerd in the chest with a handgun...yet the nerd survives.

Can I get a parody that's actually clever and witty without someone getting hurt?  Fair enough, the movie did tried some verbal pizazz, though they're either people jokingly explaining the premise of the movie it's parodying (""Invincible"") or make easy ironic suggestions, such as the coach telling his team to fail at academics.  Sometimes, the movie just got silly, like a gymnast who balanced a board with her tongue or a rival football player showing his My Little Pony locker.  The jokes are recycled (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/oh-like-the-Lucas-parody-hasn-t-been-done-before/dp/B00005JKMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">oh, like the ""Lucas"" parody hasn't been done before</a>), and what's worse, some of them are throw-aways.  Many of its parodies (like the mentioned ""Rocky Balboa"" parody) exist for for a few seconds and have no impact, cohesion, or comprehension to the plot, like a post-cancellation episode of ""Family Guy"" and just as humorless.

But thankfully ""The Comebacks"" is JUST about physical comedy, it didn't try to cringe me with toilet-related business.  As far as spoofs go, this movie does followed closely to the genre it's making fun of...unlike films by a certain directing duo.  Outside that one bizarre scene where the cast is singing and goofing around to a Journey song (at least it's not a ""Sopranos"" reference), there's no jokes about a popular heiress or an unrelated movie, just jokes revolving around sports films.  It does have one clever parody, and it's a Friday Night Lights spoof ; the humor itself isn't good, but the scene was shot in documentary style like that movie, which I thought was a nice touch.  I admit to giggling a few scenes like the ""Die Sad"" speech regarding a terminally-ill kid's wish, and Carl Weathers is a living saving grace; out of all the deliberate stereotypes and dumb characters, he's the only character I actually underestimated.  See, in the plot, he helped his best friend Fields (David Koechner) coach a usual brand of unusual football players, even though Fields is the most incompetent coach in football history; once the movie explained about Weathers's goal, it actually makes sense.

Here's what I don't understand: how is it that great parodies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" do so well using the same comedy elements that didn't work for this film? Is it because of the times, or maybe because they had old people in it? Or maybe these movies simply follow one parody and go nuts with it?  The latter is probably the right call, since this movie tries to machine-gun many parodies, and ended up missing almost every one.",1278633600,,3696,5.172818791946309

Only difference was, the first time I watched it, I was loopy on fever medication.

So my advice is, watch this when you're loopy on meds and this movie might appear a lot funnier than it really is. This is not a joke as I looked around hours just to find this movie online only to be severely disappointed, thinking I would get a good laugh as the first time I watched it.",1245196800,,591,3.957983193277311
3053368,3,B0010X8NFK,"THE COMEBACKS is one of the dumbest, crudest, foul, uncouth, imbecilic movies I've ever seen (and based on all the films I've seen that's saying something, folks).

But. . .who cares?

This is a film that allows you to sit back and let ribald David Koechner take you on one wild and zany ride as the hapless, inept football coach Lambeau Fields (football fans will adore that name).  Koechner isn't just over the top:  He's practically in your grill as he tries to mold his team of dysfunctional malcontents into a competitive college football contender.  Along the way we're treated to one sophomoric sight gag after another, and the film repeatedly spoofs several contemporary movies with all the delicacy of a doberman in a meat locker.

But again, who cares?  THE COMEBACKS is intentionally bad (and dumb), and definitely worth the handful of chuckles it brings.  The team's music video spoof to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" and Frank Caliendo in the broadcast booth playing both Al Michaels and John Madden are must-see viewing.

Unlike Epic Movie, I actually got a few good laughs out of this one.

This one makes fun of Gridiron Gang, Longest Yard errr... other football movies, as well as a few other sports. A few guest appearances by athletes such as Dennis Rodman and that guy from the NIKE adds 10 years ago (I'm Australian, I don't follow NHL)

3053376,1,B0010X8NFK,"Spoofs of films have been around for some time. They began to make headway with the genre takes on films by Mel Brooks. Then in 1980 it all changed when the film AIRPLANE hit the screens. After that send ups of specific films and the like became a staple out of Hollywood. It seems now that the trend, though not dead, is suffering its last gasps.

THE COMBACKS is a spoof of the sports films seen in the last decade or so. Coach Limbeau Fields (David Koechner) is the losingest coach of all time no matter what the sport. When an old friend lets him know about a college football team in need of a new coach, he decides to give it one last try.

Of course the team is a bunch of malcontents and hopeless ball handlers, with one gifted player who tragedy is certain to strike. Every movie from RADIO to FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS to REMEMBER THE TITANS finds a home in this flick, but not a very funny one. The jokes are lame at best and vulgar at worst. It seems that when a joke can't be found in a parody these days the answer is to resort to the rudest thing possible.

By the films end we discover that the coach's friend (played by Carl Weathers) wasn't a friend at all but using the coach to lead a possible contender against his team down the wrong path. A rallying cry from the team and the coach leads this motley crew to the finals. But will the win? Who cares!

For me a comedy is a film that makes me laugh out loud more than once. I found one thing that made me do so during the 107 minutes that this film ran and that was a pretty weak laugh at that. Koechner can be hilarious and has the potential to do great comedy, but not if he continues to settle for films like this. For a better example of a good job he's done, watch RUN RONNIE RUN.

The previews for this movie made me want to see it. But, as is often the case these days, the previews showed the best parts. And they were shown often enough that once I got to see the movie they were no longer funny.

If you're looking for a good movie to rent this week pass this one by. Look for something else new on the shelf. Or better yet, look for either AIRPLANE or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.

The jokes and sight gags were tired and executed with such ambivalance it was embarrassing. There was nothing engaging about this. From the worn out 'interracial romance' to the attempted homoerotic undertones, to the 'athletes are all bad influences' stereotypes, which are generally perfect fodder for laughs. Not this time. On a grand scale, this thing manages to consistanly gleen unfunny from potential funny.

Not too much to say about this one. It's pretty much the same as those ""scary movies"", ""date movie"", ""epic movie"" types. This is a simple minded dumb movie aimed at young teenagers, and it contains alot of sexual jokes. I don't know how this revolution started with the raunchy sex jokes (maybe American pie), but it really isn't funny. At one point the butter fingers quarterback (Matthew Lawrence) is trying to grab a girls breast. When did that become funny? Sure, I would love to squeeze some breast myself, but not for laughter. Other innapriate jokes include the rival team popping out of a giant condom before the game, and 2 female cheerleaders kissing.

There are several good cameo's from Dennis Rodman, (WWE DIVA) Stacey Keibler, and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed).",1193097600,3,955,4.817073170731708

Other than perhaps Brian's Song, this movie lampoons every other football movie ever made (and many other sports movies).  The list is impressive; this is what I saw on the first run:

Radio
Invincible
The Longest Yard
Lucas
Field of Dreams
Friday Night Lights
Wildcats
Rudy
Gridiron Gang
Waterboy
Necessary Roughness
Remember the Titans
Bend it Like Beckham
Mighty Ducks
Dodgeball
Rocky
Hoosiers
Drumline
Coach Carter

The fun in watching this movie lies not in the performances or the script - even if you've never seen the movie you already know it from beginning to end - the joy is that each ridiculous clich is lovingly embraced and then turned on its head (the only one that didn't work was the insertion of Frank Caliendo and his tired impersonations).  Included with the clichs is an great cast and an awesome number of cameos from Stacy Keibler, Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, and Bradley Cooper.  As absurd as this sounds, The Combacks is perfect for not just sports and dumb comedy fans, but all movie-goers.  With tons of homoerotic references (that somehow don't distract) that many see in football, and a three-way love triangle there is something for every fan.  If that's not enough to bring everyone together, then Journey will surely unite us all.  Don't stop believin', it worked for the Untouchables.

3287859,2,B0010X8NFK,"A spoof movie, another product of current stupefying lampoons for a sub-genre heading into the wrong direction.  A spoof is usually defined as a composition that imitates or misrepresents somebody's style, usually in a humorous way.  Therefore, if such composition has no humor to deliver, then the very point of the movie has been self-defeated.  The problem: slapstick.  It seems as though whenever a parody is made, somebody has to get hit by something.  Hear are the highlights of ""The Comebacks"": a football player getting ran over by a bus, and then gets crippled by a cashew, a mentally-challenged inspiration trips from his shopping cart and dry-humps the teacher (isn't ""Radio"" a parody in itself?), a 90-year-old Balboa-ish character got punched and turned into dust, and the running gag of people getting pummeled by opposing football players even when they're not on the field; heck, the movie even went to absurd extremes like in the ""Dodgeball"" parody when the coach shoots a nerd in the chest with a handgun...yet the nerd survives.

Can I get a parody that's actually clever and witty without someone getting hurt?  Fair enough, the movie did tried some verbal pizazz, though they're either people jokingly explaining the premise of the movie it's parodying (""Invincible"") or make easy ironic suggestions, such as the coach telling his team to fail at academics.  Sometimes, the movie just got silly, like a gymnast who balanced a board with her tongue or a rival football player showing his My Little Pony locker.  The jokes are recycled (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/oh-like-the-Lucas-parody-hasn-t-been-done-before/dp/B00005JKMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">oh, like the ""Lucas"" parody hasn't been done before</a>), and what's worse, some of them are throw-aways.  Many of its parodies (like the mentioned ""Rocky Balboa"" parody) exist for for a few seconds and have no impact, cohesion, or comprehension to the plot, like a post-cancellation episode of ""Family Guy"" and just as humorless.

But thankfully ""The Comebacks"" is JUST about physical comedy, it didn't try to cringe me with toilet-related business.  As far as spoofs go, this movie does followed closely to the genre it's making fun of...unlike films by a certain directing duo.  Outside that one bizarre scene where the cast is singing and goofing around to a Journey song (at least it's not a ""Sopranos"" reference), there's no jokes about a popular heiress or an unrelated movie, just jokes revolving around sports films.  It does have one clever parody, and it's a Friday Night Lights spoof ; the humor itself isn't good, but the scene was shot in documentary style like that movie, which I thought was a nice touch.  I admit to giggling a few scenes like the ""Die Sad"" speech regarding a terminally-ill kid's wish, and Carl Weathers is a living saving grace; out of all the deliberate stereotypes and dumb characters, he's the only character I actually underestimated.  See, in the plot, he helped his best friend Fields (David Koechner) coach a usual brand of unusual football players, even though Fields is the most incompetent coach in football history; once the movie explained about Weathers's goal, it actually makes sense.

Here's what I don't understand: how is it that great parodies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" do so well using the same comedy elements that didn't work for this film? Is it because of the times, or maybe because they had old people in it? Or maybe these movies simply follow one parody and go nuts with it?  The latter is probably the right call, since this movie tries to machine-gun many parodies, and ended up missing almost every one.",1278633600,,3696,5.172818791946309

But. . .who cares?

This is a film that allows you to sit back and let ribald David Koechner take you on one wild and zany ride as the hapless, inept football coach Lambeau Fields (football fans will adore that name).  Koechner isn't just over the top:  He's practically in your grill as he tries to mold his team of dysfunctional malcontents into a competitive college football contender.  Along the way we're treated to one sophomoric sight gag after another, and the film repeatedly spoofs several contemporary movies with all the delicacy of a doberman in a meat locker.

But again, who cares?  THE COMEBACKS is intentionally bad (and dumb), and definitely worth the handful of chuckles it brings.  The team's music video spoof to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" and Frank Caliendo in the broadcast booth playing both Al Michaels and John Madden are must-see viewing.

3287873,1,B0010X8NFK,"Spoofs of films have been around for some time. They began to make headway with the genre takes on films by Mel Brooks. Then in 1980 it all changed when the film AIRPLANE hit the screens. After that send ups of specific films and the like became a staple out of Hollywood. It seems now that the trend, though not dead, is suffering its last gasps.

THE COMBACKS is a spoof of the sports films seen in the last decade or so. Coach Limbeau Fields (David Koechner) is the losingest coach of all time no matter what the sport. When an old friend lets him know about a college football team in need of a new coach, he decides to give it one last try.

Of course the team is a bunch of malcontents and hopeless ball handlers, with one gifted player who tragedy is certain to strike. Every movie from RADIO to FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS to REMEMBER THE TITANS finds a home in this flick, but not a very funny one. The jokes are lame at best and vulgar at worst. It seems that when a joke can't be found in a parody these days the answer is to resort to the rudest thing possible.

By the films end we discover that the coach's friend (played by Carl Weathers) wasn't a friend at all but using the coach to lead a possible contender against his team down the wrong path. A rallying cry from the team and the coach leads this motley crew to the finals. But will the win? Who cares!

For me a comedy is a film that makes me laugh out loud more than once. I found one thing that made me do so during the 107 minutes that this film ran and that was a pretty weak laugh at that. Koechner can be hilarious and has the potential to do great comedy, but not if he continues to settle for films like this. For a better example of a good job he's done, watch RUN RONNIE RUN.

The previews for this movie made me want to see it. But, as is often the case these days, the previews showed the best parts. And they were shown often enough that once I got to see the movie they were no longer funny.

If you're looking for a good movie to rent this week pass this one by. Look for something else new on the shelf. Or better yet, look for either AIRPLANE or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.

The jokes and sight gags were tired and executed with such ambivalance it was embarrassing. There was nothing engaging about this. From the worn out 'interracial romance' to the attempted homoerotic undertones, to the 'athletes are all bad influences' stereotypes, which are generally perfect fodder for laughs. Not this time. On a grand scale, this thing manages to consistanly gleen unfunny from potential funny.
