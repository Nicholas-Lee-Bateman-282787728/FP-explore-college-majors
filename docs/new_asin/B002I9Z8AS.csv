3935970,5,B002I9Z8AS,"After the disastrous first Star Trek motion picture, this one got it right. It incorporates all the elements that made the Star Trek series an enduring one. Moreover, it proffers the audience an intriguing plot, as well as a memorable villain, Khan, a relic and survivor from Earth's long ago Eugenics War. It also does not focus on special effects to dazzle its audience. Instead, the film relies on its cast, coupled with an excellent script, to carry the film. In this, the film certainly succeeds, making the film a success.

The original Star Trek cast give excellent performances, with William Shatner, as the aging James T. Kirk, giving a particularly moving one. Ricardo Montalban, reprising his original role on Star Trek as the augmented human, Khan, who is now seeking revenge upon Kirk, gives a memorable performance. All in all, this film has something for everyone, especially those who are Star Trek fans, to enjoy.",1441843200,,930,4.961538461538462

3935972,5,B002I9Z8AS,"As a 'Trekkie' who saw most of the original Star Trek episodes the first time they were broadcast in the late 1960s (thank heavens my family had a good-sized color TV back then!), I believe that this Star Trek movie is the best one to date.  If you know the story of the Botany Bay and Khan from the original TV episode, so much the better.  But if not, enough of the original tale is retold to make Khan's search for retribution entirely believable.  The film also introduces the audience to one of Kirk's serious ""flames"" from his youth -- and their (now adult) son.  We're also introduced to another Vulcan played by budding actress Kirstie Alley.  Khan is a formidable foe, eventually forcing Spock to go to extraordinary lengths to save the Enterprise.  So in many ways, this is clearly the best Star Trek story ever told on the silver screen!",1436832000,,848,4.546052631578948

3935978,5,B002I9Z8AS,"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is one of the few science fiction films that has a real theme and not in the musical sense. The film is not just about action, adventure, and intrigue, although contains those elements. It is about how people deal with life and death situations and the choices they make.

The film introduces a young female Vulcan captain, played by Kirstie Alley in one of her first large roles, who appears to be at the helm of a Federation Starship which is engaged in a life and death situation. It turns out that the situation was a simulation and the young captain is not yet quite a captain but a cadet in training, and her instructor is none other than James T. Kirk, now an admiral in the Federation. The scenario, it is learned, is called the Kobayashi Maru Test, a no-win situation which tests the character rather than problem-solving ability of a young officer.

The rest of the film becomes a kind of Kobayashi Maru Test for Kirk, where at every turn he must face the un-faceable at the hands of a former foe, Khan, reprised brilliantly by Ricardo Monteblan who used to play villains before granting people's fantasies on Fantasy Island. Eventually a life and death choice is made at the climax of the movie becoming one of the best endings to a science fiction film ever shot.

The script is near perfect, and combines the best of science fiction, action, adventure, and plot with surprising emotion and heart. A brilliant film all around and one of the best performances by the Star Trek cast, especially William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. For those who were let down by Star Trek: The Motion Picture, this movie makes up for it in spades. Maybe the only stipulation is that new viewers may need to see a few of the original Star Trek episodes before seeing this movie especially because so much of the story is dependent upon the empathy that the audience will feel for the characters. An absolute triumph.

Rest In Peace, our ever-living Vulcan.",1421539200,3,1979,4.613636363636363

3935981,5,B002I9Z8AS,"This is the film (not Star Trek-The Motion Picture) that justified the continuing adventures of the Starship Enterprise. It perfectly captures the important ingredients of the original TV series (character interaction and story) without losing them in the size of the production.  Kirk and crew are back together on the Enterprise chasing an old villain who also originated from the TV series.  Ricardo Montalban returns as Khan, a genetically enhanced super-intelligence from Earths 20th century.  It is Montalbans coldly calculating performance that amps up the energy here.  All the Trek regulars are present also, and they do a fine job, especially in the touching final scene.  The movie was clever in how it handled the inevitable leaks of important plot elements in that it had you second guessing yourself until the end of the film.  In my opinion, this was the best of the original cast reunion movies and well worth viewing even in the unlikely case you are totally unfamiliar with the original series.",1410307200,,1012,5.1030303030303035
3935982,5,B002I9Z8AS,"The Wrath of Khan is perfect film. It is the only Star Trek film to transcend the boundaries of the franchise to become not just a great Star Trek film but a great science fiction film in general. So what makes The Wrath of Khan so good? It is hard to pick out a single quality. The script is great and directed brilliantly. The Wrath of Khan moves at a brisk pace that remains suspenseful without feeling rushed. All of the space battles in the film look great (especially considering that they were shot with mid-80s special effects) and are able to stay suspenseful and thrilling throughout the film. Beyond the pure action elements, The Wrath of Khan succeeds on a character level as well. Kirks insecurities are very skilfully written and acted, Khan is a joy to watch on-screen and Spocks stoicism has never been more poignant. Out of all these elements, what makes The Wrath of Khan great is that the director and writers were willing to take risks. Bringing back a villain from an original episode, making Chekov into a brainwashed puppet of Khan, and revealing that Kirk had a son are all great. But the biggest risk of all, killing off the most iconic character of the franchise, makes The Wrath of Khan a rich, emotional and classic film.",1410134400,,1249,4.605381165919282

This one was so much better than the current one playing in the theaters, although I did like that one somewhat, I thought that Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Khan was just perfect.  I'm amazed at how the special effects have held up over time although it is interesting to see that the computer's portrayed in the future are a bit archaic looking compared to what we have today.  If you missed this movie or were too young to have seen it when it came out, make sure you see it and don't let the new movie be your interpretation of the Star Trek and Khan.",1373155200,,642,4.245901639344262
3935994,5,B002I9Z8AS,"MINI REVIEW: I watched this one again after seeing STAR TREK INTO THE DARKNESS and for the record this is A LOT better story/plotting wise than the newer picture. Ricardo Montalban returns in his role as Khan and dominates the screen with his sophisticated yet sinister presence. Of course, the old crew is back from the Original Series (mostly) and this time they're dealing with the Genesis Project and a very angry Khan (it helps if you've seen the episode from the Original Series a la ""Space Seed""). The special effects are a tad dated but otherwise it's a splendid 80s movie. MY GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B plus to A minus.",1372896000,,631,4.592920353982301
3935995,5,B002I9Z8AS,"The Wrath of Khan is so much better than its predecessor, The Motion Picture. In this movie, the viewer actually feels as if things are happening and moving along, instead of the inertia of the first film. I like the delicate balance of action and intellectual problem-solving in this film. While some of the scenes are borderline tacky (such as the weak and fake-looking fistfight), the story keeps this movie on track. Kirstie Alley is fabulous in her motion picture debut, while Kirk, McCoy, and Spock deliver their usual solid acting. Khan is portrayed wonderfully, and is probably the strongest presence in the film. The special effects are good for 1982 and only a $11.2 million budget. The Wrath of Khan is a worthwhile film to watch; it isn't perfect, but it's nonetheless refreshing.",1361836800,,792,4.917910447761194
3935996,5,B002I9Z8AS,"For those of you who like action but thought the Abrams Star Trek was too brainless, loud, and turned up to 11 then ""Wrath of Khan"" is for you. This is a story of Kirk being haunted by his past and having to cope with getting older in the backdrop of the ""Genesis Project"" headed by his former lover and newly discovered son. This is an action-packed movie but interestingly Kirk and Khan are never even in the same room together. Yet this works and there is a lot of suspense. Kirk doesn't find it necessary to beam over to Khan's ship and punch him. Every shot at the other ship has some important function in the story. The crew has disagreements but they don't constantly scream at each other like the 2009 Star Trek. Ricardo Montalban plays Khan perfectly  as a Captain Ahab archetype obsessed with revenge. This isn't just a good Star Trek movie- it is a great movie regardless of genre.",1361404800,,893,4.445121951219512

3936000,4,B002I9Z8AS,"Ebert once wrote that movies like this are only as good as the villain and he is spot on. Fortunately Khan is the best villain in the Star Trek universe, the Borg being the other. That is why Khan and First Contact are the best movies before the re-launch. It is human, almost touching but also full of humor. No coincidence they decided to bring Khan back for the new Star Trek movie.",1339286400,,385,4.287671232876712
3936001,5,B002I9Z8AS,"This movie is thirty years old this year. I rewatched it to see how it holds up, since it was a favorite of my youth. I am glad to say that it holds up quite well. Shatner was never in better form as Kirk. Sure, everybody remembers him yelling ""KHAN!"" but that is his one moment of over the top performing. Ricardo Montalban is also great as Khan, though most everyone remembers him for showing off his chest. The special effects still look good. Model spaceships still look pretty good, especially compared to most CGI work. The Genesis video and cave both don't look that well 30 years later, but that's a pretty small part of the show. The humor and the pathos are still as great as ever. I also like the whole ""literary inferiority complex"" they have as a sci fi story. To make themselves look better, they quote Moby Dick and A Tale of Two Cities. These references aren't shoe-horned it but really add to the theme and story being told. A great flick and highly recommended!",1335916800,,979,4.444444444444445

3936003,5,B002I9Z8AS,"Released in the summer of 1982, the 30th anniversary of the U.S.S. Enterprise's greatest big-screen voyage is fast approaching.  With the famed 1966-69 television series' original ensemble (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, & Walter Koenig) gathered together once more, director & un-credited screenwriter Nicholas Meyer nimbly took up the challenge of reinvigorating an aging cast with a stellar intergalactic adventure featuring the return of Captain Kirk's greatest television nemesis: the imperious genetic superman known as Khan.  As a classy sequel to the first season episode (1966-67), ""Space Seed,"" this movie boldly answers the question of whatever happened to Khan (the late Ricardo Montalban) fifteen years after he and his band of marauding castaways were exiled to a remote planet by Captain Kirk as punishment for their unsuccessful attempt to steal the Enterprise.  And the answer is the Federation's worst nightmare: Khan's superhuman terrorist group seizes its top secret Project: Genesis device, which is capable of destroying and regenerating planets, as the device's possessor sees fit.  The only resistance in Khan's immediate path is the U.S.S. Enterprise, which this time is mostly staffed by cadets led by Admiral Kirk and Captain Spock.

What is perhaps most impressive about Meyer's feat (which is enhanced by Montalban's intense performance) is that one doesn't even have to view ""Space Seed"" beforehand to easily grasp who Khan is and the dark motivations behind his hellish vengeance sought against Kirk for the death of his beloved wife, a former Enterprise crewmember.  With that said, the balanced script for this second Star Trek movie is nothing short of superb in poignantly portraying Admiral Kirk's ongoing mid-life crisis.  We can grasp his initial restlessness supervising the newly promoted Captain Spock and the other veteran Enterprise crew members serving as instructors on an ominous cadet training voyage.  Further, the plotline effectively integrates several new characters, such as Kirstie Alley as Saavik; the late Merritt Butrick as David Marcus (Kirk's previously unacknowledged son); Judson Scott as Joachim; the late Paul Winfield as the ill-fated Captain Clark Terrell; and the late Bibi Besch as Dr. Carol Marcus (who may perhaps be the true reason behind Kirk's failure at long-term romances).  Most notably, Leonard Nimoy's final scenes as Captain Spock are no doubt the best ever filmed for his beloved character, and his last exchange with William Shatner in the Enterprise's engine room is arguably the most poignant moment in the franchise's storied history.

On a side note, one of the film's best underrated elements is the Kirk-Carol Marcus relationship.  Specifically, it is spelled out that Kirk knows they secretly have an adult son whom he deliberately chose to stay away from during the boy's youth, per Carol's wishes.  This mature plot twist is well-played, as it wasn't a clich back then that middle-aged action heroes had long-lost sons.  Years later, TV's ""Six Million Dollar Man"" Steve Austin and MacGyver, DC Comics' Batman, and even Indiana Jones, among others, all would have these long-lost sons, but none of them come close to the poignant believability that Shatner, Besch, and Butrick bring to this subplot.  Then, Khan has his own surrogate son, Joachim, which serves as a skewed mirror image to the turbulent Kirk-David relationship.  As much as the film's unforgettable ending is Star Trek II's legacy, Kirk's mid-life loneliness is what brings ""Star Trek"" closest to real life.

With startling ease and on a modest, streamlined budget no less, Meyer concocts a highly intelligent, literate adventure film that deftly weaves timeless adult themes of untested youth, the inevitability of old age, vengeance, death, grief, and even possible rebirth together.  Despite a major character's climatic demise, the film leaves audiences with a spiritually uplifting experience about graciously embracing old age, with the vibrant enthusiasm of seemingly eternal youth.  Khan's fatal obsession with destroying Admiral Kirk is also reflected by quoting Herman Melville's ""Moby Dick.""  Montalban's seething delivery makes the use of such literary quotes seem perfectly believable.  Additionally, Kirk quotes two famous lines from Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" bracketing the film as bookends reiterating how life and death are not just simply the beginning and the end.  Rather, it is the philosophical manner in which one chooses to face them along the way.  Upon hearing Leonard Nimoy's ghostly echo via the closing captain's log followed by the first bars of the end credits from James Horner's memorable, nautical-flavored score, you will recognize witnessing a first-class, science fiction film that doesn't insult viewers with tedious clich-fests and unnecessarily gaudy special effects.  This is the reason that ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" remains the bar by which all other Trek films have been measured and rightfully so.

Rating: 10/10 stars.  Appropriate for ages 10 and up (for occasional profanity and some mild gore).

P.S.  The numerous special features include vintage cast interviews, trailers, documentaries, etc.  They complete an excellent package for consumers.",1302739200,,5335,5.481074481074481

Wrath of Khan is certainly one of the better entries in the film series. It is vastly superior to the first film, and stands above the two follow up films (although Star Trek IV is not a terrible film). This, along with the Undiscovered Country, is certainly one of my favorites.

From the opening scenes to the final leaning on the railing at the end of the movie, it never fails to entertain. And how HOT is Kirstie Alley in the movie. No one character carries this film. Lots of great scenes for the crew and Khan. My favorites scene is the chess game in the Mutara Nebula.

Star Trek is the best Sci-Fi because it is for the Thinking Man. Todays Sci-Fi relies more on graphic and special effects to entertain the audience. Which when put with a truly great story is OK, but they are few and far between.

I have this on DVD but am tempted to get the restored Blu_Ray, has anyone else upgraded and were you pleased?",1274140800,5,763,4.141891891891892
3936007,1,B002I9Z8AS,"This review is specific to the 2009 version. The good news here is the movie: still the same great film it has always been. The bad news is, this has the lamest special features I've ever seen on a dvd.

The audio overtrack is commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto (who? I had to look him up on Wikipedia). The main reason I enjoy this type of commentary is to hear how things were done, background detail on the actors, how they approached their parts, and so on. Especially in a movie like this, full of legendary characters and on the cusp of cgi special effects, there is potential for lots of fascinating ""backstage"" drama and information. Not so here. I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of times Nicholas and Manny referred to events in the film as they were happening. Most of their discussion centered around how honored Coto was to be in the presence of the great Meyer, and how awesome Meyer was and how great his work was. This is the sort of fact that only needs to be stated so many times, and after that it just generates vigorous eye-rolling. The rest of their chat dwelt on topics like how illiterate the general public is, how terrible television is, and other vague philosophical meanderings. It had the feel of a couple of guys in a bar well into their fourth beers.

The other special features were just as disappointing. The composer of the Genesis theme music has a brief and uninspiring talk to the camera; and there is a ""Tribute to Richardo Montalban"" which consists of a guy going on at length on how great an actor Montalban is. No cute pictures of him in his childhood, no background on his family or upbringing, no clips of previous work. Just a guy talking on and on about what a great man he is. The filmmakers tried to make it interesting by varying the camera angle on the narrator, but it didn't work.

There is also a short clip intended to be a training film from Starfleet Academy discussing the disaster to Ceti Alpha VI that had potential for being interesting and informative. Unfortunately it consisted of a young woman saying vague things like ""It could have exploded...or perhaps there was an impact..."" This could have been a scientifically accurate discussion on the forces that could result in the destruction of a planet or moon, but it had the appearance of a project for 7th grade science class.

The best special feature was a look at the market for Star Trek movie relics, which at least had the benefit of people who were clearly passionate about their achievements in this field. Though it was an interesting look at an unusual topic, the fact that this was the best feature on this dvd should tell you something.

Bottom line is, if all you're looking for is the movie, this disc is as good as any other. But if you're a fan of outstanding special features, look elsewhere.",1260835200,18,2859,4.532945736434108
3936008,2,B002I9Z8AS,"I was glad to see Paramount re-released this movie on DVD since the original print from 2000 was out of production.  After watching this new version against previous releases, I'm somewhat disappointed.  The sound quality is excellent, you can again hear the people speaking in Engineering during the first attack.  But that's overshadowed by the over-use of the blue color-tint: everything seems to have been made more blue.  Check out the white pieces of the uniforms, they look blue.  The ship looks more blue.  The biggest impact was on Regulus - the brown moon is now blue.  I checked this against multiple TVs and DVD players, and got the same result.  I'm not sure what they did or whether this is considered ""enhanced"".  Good to have another copy, but disappointed in the color changes.",1254614400,6,794,4.865671641791045

8370761,2,B002I9Z8AS,"I saw this last night for the first time, or at least I don't remember it. I realize I am in the minority here, but this wasn't my thing. I enjoyed TOS where there was alot of exploration of the human psyche and usually an underlying ""moral of the story"". The characters themselves and their relationships with each other were very important. Not so with TWOK. Although it is shorter than The Motion Picture, it seemed too long and the characters were flat and disappointing. After a fight, the good guys win, but you knew that.
It seems hard to believe that this quality of movie brought the franchise back. I haven't seen all of them, but if this is supposed to be the ""best"", it is disconcerting. I have to remind myself that this movie is more than 30 years old.
I guess there are people who will watch anything with the word ""Star"" in the title, or anything with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.",1482710400,,902,4.4397590361445785
