If yo listen closely you can predict the end but otherwise it has a pretty surprising ending. The zombies in this movie are somewhat different from others: they talk, shooting them on the head doesn't work, and don't have to ""die""to be infected. I wouldn't recommend using a space in your queue for this movie, just use the instant watching.",1201996800,,505,4.75
2963363,3,B000W8OMAO,"This movie is EXACTLY what you think a comedy zombie western movie with Chris Kattan would be like!

1) ACTING: The acting was pretty good, with hardly any noticeable problems from any of the actors.

2) PRODUCTION: Everything here was good as well. This movie obviously had a real budget. Too bad this one didn't get released to the theaters. I could see it making some money. Good filming, good blood and gore, and good western settings.

3) THE ZOMBIES: Again, we get a mixture of zombie types. Some shamblers, some runners, some that can talk, use a gun, ride a horse and even break down a fortress door!

4) THE CAUSE: Mysterious Indian curse.

5) NUDITY: an appearance by both Chris Kattan's and James Denton's rear end.

This was a fun little romp into zombie land. While it isn't near the level of Shaun of the Dead for laughs and entertainment, it's really a pretty good movie! So, just sit back, ask the barkeep to wrangle you up some vittles and drinks and enjoy!

2963370,5,B000W8OMAO,The best comedy/Zombie flick I'v seen in a long time! Great mix of classic western and new zombie FX! Great casting and story line! FUN!!!,1352851200,,138,4.56
2963371,5,B000W8OMAO,A few very very disgusting scenes but all and all a great movie. If comedy and zombies are your variety I highly recommend this movie. Just dpnt eat and watch.,1343088000,,159,4.333333333333333
2963372,5,B000W8OMAO,"I chose to watch this because I love zombies and I was very grouchy, so I needed a laugh. I went into it expecting the film to be a little boring, somewhat stupid, and even a bit obnoxious. I was pleasantly surprised. I had quite a few good laughs, didn't lose interest at all, and thought it was pleasant, clever, witty, and well acted. The plot is really good, too. I liked the twist on traditional zombies and how refreshing and creative the plot was. Chris Kattan usually isn't my favorite because he's so zany and hyper, but not in this film. He's very human and likable, and yet he retains his lighthearted comedy style. I recommend this flick if you're having a bad day, or you just want a good laugh. I say it's akin to ""Shaun of the Dead"" as far as mood is concerned. I'm very pleased!",1341532800,,794,4.3
2963373,4,B000W8OMAO,"Chris Kattan was funny in this movie, it was a random purchase but Im glad I did, nice special effects and make-up, a kinda shocking ending. But overall its a solid movie.",1284768000,,171,4.375
2963374,5,B000W8OMAO,"Nave and clueless ""cowboy"" Luke (Chris Kattan) finds himself partnering up with a U.S. Army deserter named Elmer (James Denton) after they rob one really mean Sherriff in a town slowly falling victim to zombie infestation. As they attempt to elude the zombie posse that is hunting them, they cross paths with a saucy Native American girl named Sue (Navi Rawat) who is out to kill the soldiers who destroyed her people. The trio teams up on a mission to attack a fort they find also has been infected by the undead, and soon they are in the fight of their lives, desperately trying not to be eaten or join the zombie ranks themselves.

Even if you're a big fan of zombie movies, you may not yet have even heard of the direct to video release ""Undead or Alive"". Well, if the idea of a zombie comedy/western appeals to you, then you're in for a treat! ""Undead or Alive"" is just that, and it is hilarious and yet full of great zombie makeup and effects. Good to see a zombie film with such an original take and plot! Of course, much of the comedy comes from Chris Kattan, who proves he is still in top form playing a lovable goofball, but the rest of the cast is excellent too, playing off him and each other perfectly. This is definitely the ""different"" zombie film you've been looking for, and I'm only tempted to knock a star off because the use of the music adds that direct to video feeling that otherwise could have been avoided. Really, otherwise the film seems totally like a big screen release, but there's something about direct to video flicks that they just don't handle the music right, inserting songs in situations when there should have been just music without lyrics, and often they are lame songs at that. I will give props to the main theme song to this flick though, by the same title, as it is cheezy but hilarious and fun to sing long after the movie is over. And you'll be thinking about this movie after it's over, too. It is just too hilarious and the ending doesn't wimp out on you either. If only they'd make a sequel to this one where the surviving characters encounter vampires, ha!

The DVD is an excellent release for fans of the film, as it includes commentary with the stars and director, two featurettes, and the trailer. Plus, you can find this movie out and about for a steal, but even at regular price, you won't regret picking this one up if you are a fan of zombies and Chris Kattan! And if you like this one, check out ""Fido"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", and ""Zombieland"", not to mention anything with Bruce Campbell, but particularly the Evil Dead Trilogy! And the Return of the Living Dead original trilogy as well!",1279238400,5,2646,4.464876033057851
2963375,3,B000W8OMAO,"The subject title captures the essence of this movie. In the beginning of the movie, the movie itself is cast as a ""Zombiedy"" (Zombie + Comedy). This is very much true. If you're looking for your average zombie movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for a horror movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for a ""traditional"" zombie horror/blood fest, this isn't it. If you're looking for a traditional zombie movie in The Old West, this isn't it.

The movie pacing was ok, as were the visual/setting scenes. Acting is ok at best, however this may be because of the nature of the movie itself, not the actors. The dialogue and overall opinion can be described by my comments below:

This is a movie made in the tradition of the ""Not another teenage movie"", ""Not another date movie"", ""Not another scary movie"", ""Not another whatever movie"", etc movie genre. If you watch this movie with this mindset then you should enjoy it. Modern comedy with tongue in cheek quips, western clothes and settings, some visuals that come close to the bare standards of zombie movies.

Personally, an accurate title of the movie would be ""Not another zombie movie"" that happens to be set in the Old West. On a big plus side, the theme song is catchy and in sync with the movie itself.",1275350400,,1263,4.604444444444445
2963376,1,B000W8OMAO,"This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it might be with Chris Kattan in the lead. The end of this movie was poorly written and very much against women. I didn't like the fact that Luke(Chris Kattan), was more broken up about his horse being eaten than the fact that he was going to have to eat the new love of his life to break the zombie curse placed upon him. And I don't believe for a second that Sue(Navi Rawat), had to die. And neither Luke nor Elmer felt very bad that they had just eaten a human being to save themselves. Very poor writing.",1269561600,,548,4.130841121495327

2963378,4,B000W8OMAO,"A unique blend of three genres: comedy, western, and horror. Or more simply a western zombedy which changes a few rules of zombie folklore. These zombies talk, have goals and agendas, ride horseback, love their undead relatives and hate their live enemies.  Very entertaining with more laugh-out-loud moments than shrieks of terror.",1244851200,,332,5.384615384615385
2963379,3,B000W8OMAO,"Upon first appearance this looks horrible.  It's a cross between a western and a zombie movie, and Chris Kattan is one of the main stars.  By normal standards, that's a recipe for disaster.  However, all preconceptions should be thrown out.  This movie is completely ridiculous, but actually somewhat funny.

As the prologue tells us, before dying Geronimo put an evil spell on the white man.  This spell creates zombies that can think, speak, and handle weapons.  The result is a zombie-filled wild west, where the characters exchange witty quips filled with contemporary profanity while dodging brain-obsessed cowboy zombies.  It's the genesis of a genre: a western zombedy.

The three main characters are nearly perfect.  Believe it or not, the cast is pretty good; Elmer (James Denton), the gritty, military deserter who can ride a horse, handle a gun, and spit a mile; Luke (Kattan), the effeminate, incompetent cowboy; and Sue (Navi Rawat) - not to be confused with Sioux - the beautiful descendant of the legendary Apache Geronimo.  After engaging in a scuffle at a saloon, the two men become linked as they run from a posse of zombieboys intent on stealing their money and eating their brains.  Along the way they run into Sue, whose Indian family was murdered by U.S. soldiers.  She now has a vendetta to kill everyone responsible.  The mission is Siouxicide.  Sorry.  Without ruining the ""plot"", the three eventually battle a plethora of soldier-zombies inside a remote fort inexplicably built on the edge of the Grand Canyon.

There are several great aspects of this movie, not the least of which is the cast's demeanor.  No pretenses are made about this being anything other than what it is: ridiculous.  The actors almost appear to revel in it, using each opportunity to be as absurd as possible.  Scenery-wise, it's fairly spectacular.  There are a few shots that I'd put up against any other western...seriously.  Last but not least, the musical score is perfect.  It's campy as well as typically western.  What's best, however, is the faux-Brokeback Mountain guitar riff that accompanies every scene in which the two guys are alone and/or naked.  A few negatives: makeup, poorly done gore, no nudity (which is a requirement for this level of horror).

I know it sounds crazy, but this movie is better than you'd expect.  Give it one try and you'll probably snicker a few times.",1233360000,,2393,4.962216624685139
2963380,4,B000W8OMAO,It's not the best zombie flick I ever saw but it definitely wasn't the worst (that honor goes to Zombiegeddon).  I actually found it to be humorous and entertaining even they didn't follow many of the zombie rules that we see in most other zombie flicks.

2963383,2,B000W8OMAO,I am a zombieophile so I try to see and read all things zombie.  This film was just ok.  I laughed once or twice.

2963384,3,B000W8OMAO,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. A low budget western zombie picture starring B-level actors had me suspecting a huge bomb, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Whether this is due to the movie being entertaining or merely a beneficiary of zero expectations I am not certain. James Denton seemed authentic as a seasoned western soldier, Chris Kattan wasn't as annoying as he could have been, and Navi Rawat was easy on the eyes if not a very convincing Native-American. The effects were decent for a low budget film and wisely used its cheap cgi as little as possible (mostly some explosions.) I have to say that that the ending caught me a little off-guard with enough of a twist to be surprising, but not entirely out of left field. Undead or Alive is a decent enough picture if you like zombies, westerns, and comedies but not necessarily in that exact order or combination.",1206576000,,899,4.625
2963385,3,B000W8OMAO,"Undead or Alive is part of a flood of direct-to-dvd zombie movies trying to milk this new golden age of zombie flick resurgence of the past couple years. It stars SNL alum Chris ""Corky Romano"" Kattan, Desperate Housewives' James Denton and Numb3rs' Navi Rawat. The movie takes the zombie premise and puts it into an Old West setting involving a curse put into motion by Apache warrior and hero, Geronimo. Undead or Alive is not what most would call as an example of film's greatest achievement. The film on the other hand does end up becoming a fun, silly zombie comedy in an Old West setting.

The movie itself doesn't seem to take itself seriously and this shows in the irreverent attitude the actors have. It doesn't mean they sleepwalk through their scenes and just say their lines with rote, but they seem to know how ridiculous a movie they're in and have fun with it. This is especially true with the ever-irreverent Chris Kattan as the weak-link Luke to James Denton's more seasoned Elmer and Rawat's spunky Sue. The dialogue is as silly as the title and the premise with enough Old West cliche in-jokes and out-of-place modern references to make one put their face in their palm and groan with resigned amusement. But this wouldn't be a proper zombie movie if the most important ingredient wasn't mentioned and that would be the gore.

For a direct-to-dvd movie with a cast of barely-known actors Undead or Alive manages to pull off the gore factor quite admirably. Limbs are pulled off and blood splashes against walls. There are times where the effects betray its low-budget roots, but by the time these happen one either has bought into and enjoying Undead or Alive or probably has already turned off the movie and went on to something else.

Undead or Alive won't win many awards and if they do it probably won't be for anything to be proud of. The filmmakers and actors did create a fun little Western zomcom with performances that won't embarrass the viewer for having even seen it. While it's not something to place in one's collection of movies to watch over and over again this little zombie comedy is something that would entertain for a sitting when there's nothing else to do or see.",1203984000,4,2204,4.689922480620155

3197868,5,B000W8OMAO,A few very very disgusting scenes but all and all a great movie. If comedy and zombies are your variety I highly recommend this movie. Just dpnt eat and watch.,1343088000,,159,4.333333333333333
3197869,5,B000W8OMAO,"I chose to watch this because I love zombies and I was very grouchy, so I needed a laugh. I went into it expecting the film to be a little boring, somewhat stupid, and even a bit obnoxious. I was pleasantly surprised. I had quite a few good laughs, didn't lose interest at all, and thought it was pleasant, clever, witty, and well acted. The plot is really good, too. I liked the twist on traditional zombies and how refreshing and creative the plot was. Chris Kattan usually isn't my favorite because he's so zany and hyper, but not in this film. He's very human and likable, and yet he retains his lighthearted comedy style. I recommend this flick if you're having a bad day, or you just want a good laugh. I say it's akin to ""Shaun of the Dead"" as far as mood is concerned. I'm very pleased!",1341532800,,794,4.3
3197870,4,B000W8OMAO,"Chris Kattan was funny in this movie, it was a random purchase but Im glad I did, nice special effects and make-up, a kinda shocking ending. But overall its a solid movie.",1284768000,,171,4.375
3197871,5,B000W8OMAO,"Nave and clueless ""cowboy"" Luke (Chris Kattan) finds himself partnering up with a U.S. Army deserter named Elmer (James Denton) after they rob one really mean Sherriff in a town slowly falling victim to zombie infestation. As they attempt to elude the zombie posse that is hunting them, they cross paths with a saucy Native American girl named Sue (Navi Rawat) who is out to kill the soldiers who destroyed her people. The trio teams up on a mission to attack a fort they find also has been infected by the undead, and soon they are in the fight of their lives, desperately trying not to be eaten or join the zombie ranks themselves.

Even if you're a big fan of zombie movies, you may not yet have even heard of the direct to video release ""Undead or Alive"". Well, if the idea of a zombie comedy/western appeals to you, then you're in for a treat! ""Undead or Alive"" is just that, and it is hilarious and yet full of great zombie makeup and effects. Good to see a zombie film with such an original take and plot! Of course, much of the comedy comes from Chris Kattan, who proves he is still in top form playing a lovable goofball, but the rest of the cast is excellent too, playing off him and each other perfectly. This is definitely the ""different"" zombie film you've been looking for, and I'm only tempted to knock a star off because the use of the music adds that direct to video feeling that otherwise could have been avoided. Really, otherwise the film seems totally like a big screen release, but there's something about direct to video flicks that they just don't handle the music right, inserting songs in situations when there should have been just music without lyrics, and often they are lame songs at that. I will give props to the main theme song to this flick though, by the same title, as it is cheezy but hilarious and fun to sing long after the movie is over. And you'll be thinking about this movie after it's over, too. It is just too hilarious and the ending doesn't wimp out on you either. If only they'd make a sequel to this one where the surviving characters encounter vampires, ha!

The DVD is an excellent release for fans of the film, as it includes commentary with the stars and director, two featurettes, and the trailer. Plus, you can find this movie out and about for a steal, but even at regular price, you won't regret picking this one up if you are a fan of zombies and Chris Kattan! And if you like this one, check out ""Fido"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", and ""Zombieland"", not to mention anything with Bruce Campbell, but particularly the Evil Dead Trilogy! And the Return of the Living Dead original trilogy as well!",1279238400,5,2646,4.464876033057851
3197872,3,B000W8OMAO,"The subject title captures the essence of this movie. In the beginning of the movie, the movie itself is cast as a ""Zombiedy"" (Zombie + Comedy). This is very much true. If you're looking for your average zombie movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for a horror movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for a ""traditional"" zombie horror/blood fest, this isn't it. If you're looking for a traditional zombie movie in The Old West, this isn't it.

The movie pacing was ok, as were the visual/setting scenes. Acting is ok at best, however this may be because of the nature of the movie itself, not the actors. The dialogue and overall opinion can be described by my comments below:

This is a movie made in the tradition of the ""Not another teenage movie"", ""Not another date movie"", ""Not another scary movie"", ""Not another whatever movie"", etc movie genre. If you watch this movie with this mindset then you should enjoy it. Modern comedy with tongue in cheek quips, western clothes and settings, some visuals that come close to the bare standards of zombie movies.

Personally, an accurate title of the movie would be ""Not another zombie movie"" that happens to be set in the Old West. On a big plus side, the theme song is catchy and in sync with the movie itself.",1275350400,,1263,4.604444444444445
3197873,1,B000W8OMAO,"This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it might be with Chris Kattan in the lead. The end of this movie was poorly written and very much against women. I didn't like the fact that Luke(Chris Kattan), was more broken up about his horse being eaten than the fact that he was going to have to eat the new love of his life to break the zombie curse placed upon him. And I don't believe for a second that Sue(Navi Rawat), had to die. And neither Luke nor Elmer felt very bad that they had just eaten a human being to save themselves. Very poor writing.",1269561600,,548,4.130841121495327

3197875,4,B000W8OMAO,"A unique blend of three genres: comedy, western, and horror. Or more simply a western zombedy which changes a few rules of zombie folklore. These zombies talk, have goals and agendas, ride horseback, love their undead relatives and hate their live enemies.  Very entertaining with more laugh-out-loud moments than shrieks of terror.",1244851200,,332,5.384615384615385
3197876,3,B000W8OMAO,"Upon first appearance this looks horrible.  It's a cross between a western and a zombie movie, and Chris Kattan is one of the main stars.  By normal standards, that's a recipe for disaster.  However, all preconceptions should be thrown out.  This movie is completely ridiculous, but actually somewhat funny.

As the prologue tells us, before dying Geronimo put an evil spell on the white man.  This spell creates zombies that can think, speak, and handle weapons.  The result is a zombie-filled wild west, where the characters exchange witty quips filled with contemporary profanity while dodging brain-obsessed cowboy zombies.  It's the genesis of a genre: a western zombedy.

The three main characters are nearly perfect.  Believe it or not, the cast is pretty good; Elmer (James Denton), the gritty, military deserter who can ride a horse, handle a gun, and spit a mile; Luke (Kattan), the effeminate, incompetent cowboy; and Sue (Navi Rawat) - not to be confused with Sioux - the beautiful descendant of the legendary Apache Geronimo.  After engaging in a scuffle at a saloon, the two men become linked as they run from a posse of zombieboys intent on stealing their money and eating their brains.  Along the way they run into Sue, whose Indian family was murdered by U.S. soldiers.  She now has a vendetta to kill everyone responsible.  The mission is Siouxicide.  Sorry.  Without ruining the ""plot"", the three eventually battle a plethora of soldier-zombies inside a remote fort inexplicably built on the edge of the Grand Canyon.

There are several great aspects of this movie, not the least of which is the cast's demeanor.  No pretenses are made about this being anything other than what it is: ridiculous.  The actors almost appear to revel in it, using each opportunity to be as absurd as possible.  Scenery-wise, it's fairly spectacular.  There are a few shots that I'd put up against any other western...seriously.  Last but not least, the musical score is perfect.  It's campy as well as typically western.  What's best, however, is the faux-Brokeback Mountain guitar riff that accompanies every scene in which the two guys are alone and/or naked.  A few negatives: makeup, poorly done gore, no nudity (which is a requirement for this level of horror).

I know it sounds crazy, but this movie is better than you'd expect.  Give it one try and you'll probably snicker a few times.",1233360000,,2393,4.962216624685139
3197877,4,B000W8OMAO,It's not the best zombie flick I ever saw but it definitely wasn't the worst (that honor goes to Zombiegeddon).  I actually found it to be humorous and entertaining even they didn't follow many of the zombie rules that we see in most other zombie flicks.

3197881,3,B000W8OMAO,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. A low budget western zombie picture starring B-level actors had me suspecting a huge bomb, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Whether this is due to the movie being entertaining or merely a beneficiary of zero expectations I am not certain. James Denton seemed authentic as a seasoned western soldier, Chris Kattan wasn't as annoying as he could have been, and Navi Rawat was easy on the eyes if not a very convincing Native-American. The effects were decent for a low budget film and wisely used its cheap cgi as little as possible (mostly some explosions.) I have to say that that the ending caught me a little off-guard with enough of a twist to be surprising, but not entirely out of left field. Undead or Alive is a decent enough picture if you like zombies, westerns, and comedies but not necessarily in that exact order or combination.",1206576000,,899,4.625
3197882,3,B000W8OMAO,"Undead or Alive is part of a flood of direct-to-dvd zombie movies trying to milk this new golden age of zombie flick resurgence of the past couple years. It stars SNL alum Chris ""Corky Romano"" Kattan, Desperate Housewives' James Denton and Numb3rs' Navi Rawat. The movie takes the zombie premise and puts it into an Old West setting involving a curse put into motion by Apache warrior and hero, Geronimo. Undead or Alive is not what most would call as an example of film's greatest achievement. The film on the other hand does end up becoming a fun, silly zombie comedy in an Old West setting.

The movie itself doesn't seem to take itself seriously and this shows in the irreverent attitude the actors have. It doesn't mean they sleepwalk through their scenes and just say their lines with rote, but they seem to know how ridiculous a movie they're in and have fun with it. This is especially true with the ever-irreverent Chris Kattan as the weak-link Luke to James Denton's more seasoned Elmer and Rawat's spunky Sue. The dialogue is as silly as the title and the premise with enough Old West cliche in-jokes and out-of-place modern references to make one put their face in their palm and groan with resigned amusement. But this wouldn't be a proper zombie movie if the most important ingredient wasn't mentioned and that would be the gore.

For a direct-to-dvd movie with a cast of barely-known actors Undead or Alive manages to pull off the gore factor quite admirably. Limbs are pulled off and blood splashes against walls. There are times where the effects betray its low-budget roots, but by the time these happen one either has bought into and enjoying Undead or Alive or probably has already turned off the movie and went on to something else.

Undead or Alive won't win many awards and if they do it probably won't be for anything to be proud of. The filmmakers and actors did create a fun little Western zomcom with performances that won't embarrass the viewer for having even seen it. While it's not something to place in one's collection of movies to watch over and over again this little zombie comedy is something that would entertain for a sitting when there's nothing else to do or see.",1203984000,4,2204,4.689922480620155

At times this movie looks very grand and epic at other times it looks very low budget. This mix is good blend for zombie movies. This film doesn't stick with the classic zombie stuff ( the zombies talk ride horses and shoot guns),so if that's not your bag stay away. If your looking for something entertaining and funny then get this. The actors are spot on. Which is rare in these types of movies. The commentary is very entertaining as well. Because they shot this in new mexico it gives the film an overall quality of grandure. There are not that many laughed but the few laughs it delivers are very deep gut shots. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. And I watch troma films, troma this is not but it delivers some black humor that is unparaleld by anything I've seen so far.( wait till you see the ""love scene"" if that doesn't get you then you have no funny bone to tickle).
