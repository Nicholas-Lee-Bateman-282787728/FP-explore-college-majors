8338083,1,B001RJ1Y5S,"I think Yiyun Li is a good writer, but these people did a terrible job putting the story to film . The film's story line is slow, boring and confusing; and it seems like some students were desperately trying to be creative with the camera work--unsuccessfully.",1419638400,,260,4.673913043478261
8338084,2,B001RJ1Y5S,"I enjoyed his time capsuling of Toisanese accents in old days Chinatown but I never enjoy his movies.

I loved the face of the lead actress immediately but when she opens her mouth - a gift - pure China - authentic Mainland China.  Everything about her hysically is a combination of China and the West and in this person, I feel like we were gifted by the life choices that raised her to be Chinese but possibly she lost something and the other parts of her lost out on her.

This movie is full of it in what the Chinese females say and do but some thigns are pretty ""joot"" as they say in Cantonese such as when a table of Pina Colada couples are parroting elbow patch opinions about Commie China in contrast to the product of such a coupling being very Chinese and automatic in her declaration that they don't know anything about China.  It could just be that they are not being honest in that they are DENYING that China is made up of human beings and misattribute motivations to situations in China that dismiss this fundamental right to be assessed as they assess themselves and others.

is Wayne Wang saying something about how a perfectly nice Chinese child loses out on her right to outrage if raised in an environment that is not outspoken enough and isn't taught to be a little or a lot rude for her own safety.  Because someone needs to dig out that bisexual Beijinger who impregnated her and make him pay.  And she shouldn't be with that returned expat - that's very Sung Yeung - not very Southern.

It doesn't matter if you are more than half notChinese, if you are raised to own your right to be Chinese, you wouldn't be facing this kind of thing.

Also, I find it very unreal and disturbing that no one is asking her right away - hey are you a hybrid?

I heard my aunt and uncle repeatedly ask their Canadian cousins that question repeatedly at dinner as if they couldn't help themselves.  Chinese people are very simple and direct on this matter because to them its not a bad thing to admit to even though it is DIFFERENT - Chinese people always ask, ""hey are you ...?""

that wasn't in this movie at all

She's not being protected enough in this film.  She's not protecting herself enough and there isn't enough fury.

She also looks like my little half cousin who actually was in a similar situation where there wasn't enough fury.

Who's to say that Beijinger didn't toy with her just to SAMPLE a hybrid as if she wasn't as protected as one of regular Chinese girls?

She's so much ours and for scumbags to take secret bites out of her and get away with her because her background neglected to download the mutual enmity between Chinese people - to PROTECT her right - that's upsetting.",1406678400,,2703,4.428282828282828
8338085,4,B001RJ1Y5S,"I've always have been a fan of Wayne Wang and this film is the reason why.  A Young girl finds out she is going to have a baby. Is she going to have a abortion? Is she going to keep the baby? Is she going to sell her baby in the illegal baby market? The beautiful Ling Li
plays the young girl not as a victim, but as a strong vocal person trying to make up her mind. Or is she just bored and every idea that pops in her mind she runs with it for that moment. One moment she can be very sexy and cunning, and the next she can be waif like and innocent. We watch this film as if we are picking into a window. I don't think it was the director's idea to let us fully into her world. It's like listening to a couple of 18 year old girls talking at the bus stop and their ideas and thoughts jumping all over the place. We may think their is no substance to what they say, but to them nothing else matters except what they think and feel. It's slow
moving, but I did not want to be rushed. There is a beautiful moment (one of many)where she looks at herself in a mirror and she is looking at her belly. Her belly bearly shows she is going to have a baby,which by the way helps her when she wants to hang out at bars.
The special features are great. My favorite is the photo gallery on making this film. The photos and there are quite a few of Ms. Li are  breath taking. This woman is mad beautiful.",1264118400,2,1392,3.897887323943662
8338086,3,B001RJ1Y5S,"This is one of those films which requires a great deal of concentration and some intuition to keep up with.  It is a good and well-done movie that treats accidental pregnancy with respect and caring.  It tries to show the emotions and thoughts a young lady would probably go through in living the situation.  The ending is incredibly realistic though very symbolic, enigmatic and perplexing.  The ending could give one a sense of hopelessness, but in reality, it is just another mountain to move or wall to break through.",1247097600,3,521,4.820224719101123
