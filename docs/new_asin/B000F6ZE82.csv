2553484,5,B000F6ZE82,A tragedy that hits very close to home. It was nice to hear of the healing after all these years. I remember as a child being terrified every time the door to the sanctuary opened...my home church was in the same county as this happened.,1438819200,,237,4.288888888888889

2553489,4,B000F6ZE82,"This is a very good dvd. it is also very short. A band called Mortification also did a song about this dvd called ""Martrys"".",1184284800,,124,4.208333333333333
8118293,2,B000F6ZE82,"It was expensive and very short, only a half hour.  Was disappointed.",1517184000,,69,4.75
8118294,4,B000F6ZE82,It had some interesting points about causes and after-effects worth hearing.  However it was excessively dramatic and did not give all the victims equal time.  Pretty biased toward the little girl's family alone.  I would have liked to hear more about the other victims.  The film was painfully drawn out and I was wishing it was shorter.,1510099200,,338,4.87719298245614

8118297,5,B000F6ZE82,This movie reminds me how lucky we are in the US to have the freedoms we have. It also sickens me to see sjw wanting to steal these rights in favor of communism and sharia law. Scary times we live in. This could be our future.,1490745600,,226,3.9347826086956523

8118300,5,B000F6ZE82,"This was a sobering look at the need for security even in churches in these times.  This congregation was truly under fire, but their responses are an inspiration to Christians everywhere.",1473120000,,188,5.064516129032258
8118301,5,B000F6ZE82,"The documentary was extremely interesting and over half was presented in first person. Since my brother and I graduated from Daingerfield High in the early 70's, 3 of the fatalities were classmates' fathers. It was very detailed and presented well. You could feel the raw emotion even 35 years  later.  The healing parts were a tribute to God's presence and the will of the families to carry on.",1461542400,2,395,4.794117647058823
