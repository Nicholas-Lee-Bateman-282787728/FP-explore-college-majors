The video is absolutely worthless, unless you want to watch some dude talking the whole time and seeing no pictures of what they're actually talking about (which was the only reason for purchasing in the first place).",1492387200,,296,4.823529411764706

8668978,4,B00LYHXGFE,"Fascinating ideas but poor quality production. No matter how interesting the topic, it is hard to follow a lecture with poor sound quality and with the speaker constantly referencing a slideshow that is off-screen.",1474243200,,214,5.323529411764706
8668979,3,B00LYHXGFE,"ostensibly based on his book ""Forbidden Archeology"".  Cremo presents his case for an origin of homo sapiens hundreds of thousands if not millions of years older than mainstream paleoanthropology using published papers by distinguished archeologist and paleontologists that don't fit into the dominant paradigm.  These original papers ultimately get filtered out of the common understanding of the subject.

Cremo supplements his talk with a series of informative slides.  Unfortunately, whoever was filming was asleep at the switch since we see Cremo and not a single slide. There is even a moment when Cremo literally moves out of the frame to indicate something in the slide and the camera remains fixed on a blank wall. So, while Cremo reads projected texts and refers to photographs of archeological digs, graphs, and the like, we never see any of it. Very frustrating.  But seems to be par for the course for some of these Reality TV presentations.

My rating is essentially based on a zero for videography, and a 4 for Cremo's lecture.",1471305600,,1041,5.094117647058823
8668980,2,B00LYHXGFE,"An interesting lecture was totally ruined by a very poor attempt at videoing the event which focused on Cremo and couldn't even include the slide display. It was equally ruined by some idiot in the audience who kept coughing and clearing his throat throughout the entire lecture which, I suspect, included the ""cameraman"" who at one point was talking to someone nearby. Having filmed weddings, I know that one golden rule is that you must keep as quiet as a mouse behind the camera when you are recording or else the camera mic will pick you up!

I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. The other features are nonsense. I didn't even get 5 minutes into them when I turned off. If, like me, you are fascinated by this subject, then get the books by Cremo. They will be much more informative. Or buy The Mysterious Origins Of Man DVD which is far superior to this DVD with much more information and is professionally produced.",1467244800,,928,4.624242424242424
8668981,2,B00LYHXGFE,Poorly presented lecture of bizarre and poorly put together dubious information,1422489600,3,79,6.2727272727272725
8668982,1,B00LYHXGFE,"IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO ONE MAN SPEAK AND LECTURE, AND WHATCH A SECOND MOVIE ABOUT THE SEPENTS
WHERE YOU WATCH 2 DIFFERENT SCENES INTERMINGLED THIS IS THE DVD FOR YOU. THE DVD ABOUT SERPENTS HAS ACID
ROCK AS MUSIC. THIS TYPE OF MUSIC IS NOT FOR AN EDUCATIONAL DVD. GIV E IT A PASS, SAVE YOUR MONEY.
ALL REALITY DVDS ARE LIKE THIS. HAD I HAD NOTICED THIS I WOULD  NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT. THERE  ARE MUCH BETTER DVDS ON THE MARKET. THEY NEVER ADVISE YOU THAT IT IS 90 LECTURE BY ONE MAN IN A DINGY LITTLE HALL",1415404800,3,506,4.0
8668983,3,B00LYHXGFE,"Ok, this is yet another mish-mash job from Reality Films.  For every good release from this company, we have to endure 3 or 4 bad ones.  This ""comprehensive multi DVD set"" (per the cover blurb) contains exactly TWO discs--a DVD-R of a 90 minute lecture by Michael Cremo (which is the only reason to get this ""set"") and a pressed DVD of the abysmal ""Secrets Of The Serpent,"" which has seen multiple releases over the years (made in 2006, the copyright on this disc is 2009).  What this psychedelic throwback to 60s Eastern Religion crap has to do with Cremo's talk is beyond me.  Since ""Secrets"" is a 51 minute film, and the ""set"" contains ""three hours"" of programming, I guess the worthless music videos for Serpent and a short film round out the program.

Reality: you do some good things, but putting together ""sets"" like these is not good for your repeat sales.  I've purchased several of your ""new releases"" over the years, only to find inclusion of previously released (and mostly worthless) programs.

Amazon: thanks to your cheap bubble envelope packaging BOTH discs were loose in the case and scratched.  Of course, it is in part Reality's fault for using those crummy cheap DVD cases that they're famous for that wouldn't hold a disc in place if it was touched by a feather.

Sorry for the rant.  If you want to see Cremo's videotaped lecture, this release might be worth it for you.  Just expect to use the Serpent disc for a Frisbee, or watch it when high on drugs.  That's about the only way it will make sense!",1414627200,7,1523,4.5793357933579335
