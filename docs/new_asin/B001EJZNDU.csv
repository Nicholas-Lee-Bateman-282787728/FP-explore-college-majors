3555219,5,B001EJZNDU,I have read all the Phillip Pullman novels and this second of a trilogy of TV movie versions is true to the book.  I especially like Billie Piper in her role and I was not disappointed.,1233532800,4,185,4.138888888888889
3555220,2,B001EJZNDU,"I watched this on PBS because I enjoyed Billie Piper's acting on Doctor Who and I'm also a fan of BBC mystery shows in general. My overall criticism is that Billie was miscast. She is very talented, but I believe her acting strengths come from her youthful energy and playfulness--her character in this show had neither. I didn't want to see Rose Tyler in a Victorian dress, mind you, but I did want to see her explore another character in depth. I think she fell flat. I really enjoyed the character of Axel, which was acted wonderfully by Jared Lewis, and that is what saved the show from being a one-star affair. I thought the ending was predictable and unlikely. I've only seen this one episode, but if the other 3 are like it then comparing this series to Nancy Drew is accurate. It would be acceptable as an introductory ""Mystery 101"" class for teenagers.",1231804800,4,861,4.561290322580645
3555221,2,B001EJZNDU,"I am sure that this is great but having seen the BBC version versus the PBS version, let me just say that the very critical scene of Fred proposing and her accepting is not in the PBS version.  It isn't like you saw anything bad.  But you did get to see Fred and Sally having a romantic moment, when she confesses that she didn't realize she is more with him than without.  I refuse to buy this version.",1223424000,20,403,4.141025641025641
3555222,5,B001EJZNDU,"""The Shadow in the North"" is adapted from the 2nd book in Philip Pulman's ""Sally Lockhart Mysteries"" series, which cast an intrepid young woman as an unlikely detective in Victorian England. It takes place in 1878, 6 years after ""The Ruby in the Smoke"". Sally Lockhart (Billie Piper) is now in her early 20s and has gone into business for herself as a financial consultant. Fred Garland (J.J. Feild), meanwhile, is officially in the detective business with Jim Taylor (Matt Smith). An elderly client of Sally's suspects fraud when she loses her savings on a seemingly solid investment, so Sally sets out to determine if there is something sinister behind the Swedish businessman Axel Bellman (Jared Lewis) who walked away from the bankruptcy. A conjurer named Alistair MacKinnon (Julian Rhind-Tutt) insists to Fred and Jim that he is being pursued by a murderer he saw in a vision, who is none other than Mr. Bellman.

This BBC production of ""The Shadow in the North"" allows for much more intricacy of plot and character development than its predecessor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ruby-in-the-Smoke/dp/B000NIBUP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ruby in the Smoke</a>, which had to devote most of its time to introducing characters. Sally is reluctant to give up her hard-earned independence so shuns any thought of marriage to Fred Garland, who is obviously in love with her. Glimpses of the popular spiritualist movement and Bram Stoker at the Lyceum Theatre are fun historical references. The ""steam gun"" at the center of the mysteries was apparently inspired by the real Nordenfelt Gun, a multi-barrel machine gun produced in the 1870s by Thorsten Nordenfelt, whose name resembles the fictional inventor of the steam gun, Arne Nordenfels. Sally is more worldly, confident, and perhaps more stubborn than she was at 16, and overall this mystery is less rushed, more satisfying, and the mix of characters from all walks of life creates a nice balance.",1222732800,24,2003,5.3789808917197455
3555223,4,B001EJZNDU,"""The Shadow in the North"" is the second Masterpiece Theater installment of the Sally Lockhart Mysteries, based on the novels by Philip Pullman.  Sally Lockhart (Billie Piper from ""Mansfield Park"") is a very independent, and very unusual, self-employed female living in Victorian England.  Sally bills herself as a financial consultant, but she and her photographer boyfriend Fred (JJ Feild from ""Northanger Abbey"") and their would-be playwright friend Jim are really a private detective agency.

The case begins with two separate threads, a old woman seeking restitution for the bankruptcy of a shipping firm, and a Scottish magician seeking protection from a mysterious man whom he saw commit a murder in a vision.  Sally and Fred pursue their respective investigations, only to find them intertwining in the person of an exceedingly ruthless businessman named Axel Bellman.  Bellman does not take kindly to being investigated, and will threaten Sally's reputation, her friends, and her life, before making her a shocking offer.  The ending of this complicated and hard-boiled mystery features more than one plot twist.

The story is richly populated with a variety of Victorian-era characters, including a wealthy heiress, a woman who conducts surprisingly insightful seances, a seamtress who hides from the light, a mystified patent clerk, and a few dangerous thugs.  The narrative is melodramatic and sometimes awkwardly modern, with an ending that would seem contrived were it not for the studious attention paid to the occult aspects of the story.

""The Shadow in the North"" is highly recommended as an entertaining and different installment of Masterpiece Mystery.",1222560000,13,1671,5.445736434108527
3555224,2,B001EJZNDU,"Not up to the usual PBS standards. Too short of a film to do the story justice.

However, I highly recommend the book upon which this film was based.",1405900800,,149,4.137931034482759

and Surprise, surprise  the Star is a Woman whose smart, beautiful, and totally
handles all the obstacles the vicious men in this mystery throw at her
it will keep your interest and attention till the last scene oh and it has
close caption for those who need help with the english accent--loved it!",1393372800,,372,4.636363636363637
3555227,2,B001EJZNDU,"I don't know whether it was the fact that there are so many characters, some of the actors were poor in elocuting, thus losing parts of the script.  I am a great fan of English Mysteries, but this one fell short.",1383004800,2,212,4.170731707317073
3555228,5,B001EJZNDU,"I love period pieces that are well done. This series is well done and Shadow in the North is my favorite of the two mysteries. Billie Piper does an excellent job of player the character of a young woman who smart, determined to get to the truth, and equally determined not to be told by society what her limitations as a woman are. Her friends are great additions to the ensemble cast.

Part of what makes this episode so good is the villain in the mystery. He is amoral and frightening. When he discovers how intelligent Sally (Billy Piper) is and that she has been able to track him as the person responsible for her client's missing investment money, he decides to offer a proposal of marriage. He offers a few threats along with the proposal and thinks that she will cave in to him.

Thanks to the villain someone close to Sally is killed. She is determined to make him pay for her loss and she does it in a very clever way that he doesn't see coming. Sally is courageous in many ways, especially for the time period she lived in. The character of Sally Lockhart makes for compelling television.",1376438400,,1099,4.435643564356436
3555229,1,B001EJZNDU,"I remember a time when PBS and WGBH, and Mystery in particular, produced adult entertainment of quality. I took a flyer on this based on the blurb. Seemingly scripted by a teenager whose moral development does not exceed her knowledge of Victorian England. The acting, if so it may be called, rises to script.",1372291200,4,309,4.7407407407407405
3555230,5,B001EJZNDU,"I thought that Billie Piper did a pretty good job in this.  After all she does want to show that she can protray other characters than Rose Tyler, which she also did a pretty good job in.  I can understand her not wanting to get married, even though she loves him.  A woman still gave up mostly everything.  If this took place later like after women got the right to vote and got other rights, such as keeping own money etc, if would be different.  After reading one review, I didn't know that he proposed to her and she accepted. That review said it was in the BBC version. It must be that he had no attention of changing her and taking her money, etc and would even have it be put in writing, making it legal.  What a shame (for those of you who have not watched it, don't read this any further) that he died, but it's great that she is having his child.  But maybe she can say it's someone else's and she adopted it, not that she would care what poeple would say about her, but this takes place in the 1880's where children not born in wedlock as they put it were treated badly by so-called christian people.  So do I recemmend this? Yes I do.",1338336000,,1146,4.153846153846154
3555231,4,B001EJZNDU,"THE SHADOW IN THE NORTH is the BBC's second (and sadly the last) of their ""Sally Lockhart Mysteries"" series, based on the novels of Philip Pullman.  The story picks up several years after the events of ""Ruby in the Smoke"", and much has changed in the lives of Sally and her friends.

Setting herself up in her own accountancy business, Sally (Billie Piper) has little time for crime-solving... instead handing over that mantle to Frederick Garland (JJ Feild), who now dabbles in amateur detectives along with Jim (Matt Smith).  Rosa (Hayley Atwell) has married Reverend Bedwell (David Harewood), so naturally Fred wishes to know when Sally wants to set their own wedding date.  Even if Sally wanted to, the events that are about to unravel will delay their plans...

Fred and Jim are asked to help protect a magician, Alistair MacKinnon (Julian Rhind-Tutt), who believes he is being stalked by a person he has seen committing a murder in a vision, which is also experienced by clairvoyant Nellie Budd (Dona Kroll); whilst Sally's latest client has lost thousands of pounds in a bankrupt shipping firm.  Could the two incidents be linked?

SHADOW IN THE NORTH is a deliciously darker, densely-packed story which in many ways is more satisfying than the earlier ""Ruby in the Smoke"".  Populating SHADOW... are some fascinating characters, and there is a moodier edge to the events in this film.

I'm not sure why the BBC decided to cut short their series of ""Sally Lockhart Mysteries"".  One suspects it was mainly a budgeting problem (design-wise it seems that nothing was spared on the screen in either ""Ruby..."" or ""Shadow..."").  The way things are left at the climax of SHADOW..., however, there is a satisfying closure.  Despite this, author Philip Pullman beautifully continued Sally's story for two additional books, filling in the fate of vanished orphan Adelaide in the fourth instalment, ""The Tin Princess"".",1332547200,2,1913,5.018987341772152

3555233,5,B001EJZNDU,"We saw this on Masterpiece Theatre--or was it Mystery Theatre--whatever.  What a nice job they did on bringing the books to television.  We bought the books immediately.  The family devoured them.  As soon as the videos came out, we grabbed them.  If you have kids, be sure that you have these in the house.  I hope BBC will do all the Sally Lockhart books.",1248393600,2,357,4.5

8298407,5,B001EJZNDU,"This Masterpiece Theater production adapts the first book in the Phillip Pullman mystery series. It retained the elements of economic intrigue, feminism, and mystery in the Victorian era. One of Pullman's many great talents is creating believably intelligent, strong, brave, and flawed female protagonists. The casting was truly excellent, which is what you expect from Masterpiece. Doctor Who's Billie Piper is excellent as the young heroine. You'll also recognize fellow Whovian actor Matt Smith, and Captain America alums JJ Feild and Hayley Atwell pre-Avenger movies. And the villain is devilishly played by Harry Potter's Mrs. Weasley, Julie Walters. The film is a terrific stand alone mystery even if you're not a fan of the author, the books, or the setting. A second film was made of next book in the four-book series that is also well-worth watching.",1426118400,,859,5.2773722627737225
