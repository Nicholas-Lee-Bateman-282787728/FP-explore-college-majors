436647,5,6302215730,"If this can happen to me, a freshman, it can happen to you. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is one great movie that I suggest every cynical person out there should sit down and watch. Mr. Kaye is hillarious and he'll make you a believer. I never thought that anyone was as funny as Ryan Stiles (one of my favorite actors), as talented as Mark Hamill (another favorite), and as lovable as Michael J. Fox (another favorite). The best number in this movie is...well, which could I choose from? I'd have to say that the scene where Mr. Kaye is imitating an old teacher of his. It got my class laughing...tell your kids to watch this movie. The younger ones may not get it, but you should still let them watch it. To this day, every time I read my Walter Mitty story in my reading book, I always think of my research teacher saying, ""So, how's Walter Mitty doing?"" I have to get this movie for my friends to see!",977097600,6,909,4.290697674418604

436649,5,6302215730,My grandfather adored this movie when it was released. So did my father a few years later. So do I now. This movie has a grace and an irny that is hard to find nowadays.

436741,5,6302215730,Watched this movie when I was a kid and it was one of my favorites.  When the new remake Secret Life Of Walter Mitty came out I bought this so I could have a good comparison between the two movies.  Most movie remakes loose the spirit of original.  This movie now is a bit outdated with the slapstick comedy but I would recommend watching this first and then watching the new version afterward.  The story line is different but the spirit of the first movie comes through.  Both would be good to have in your movie collection.,1508457600,,526,4.381443298969073

Other than the characters sharing the same name and getting lost in day dreams, these two movies are nothing alike.

437021,4,6302215730,"I don't think anyone nowadays really thinks this film is a true blue 'Classic' (is it even considered a minor classic? Witness the lateness in showing up on DVD, showing up only on the Warner Archive Collection and even then only in full screen ratio.) Nevertheless it is a fine fantasy comedy which manages to bring in some hearty laughs.

The structure it's built on would make for a typical Hitchcock suspense/adventure/romance, in fact, the inclusion of Dutch treasures could very well be a nod to Foreign Correspondent (1940), and the daydreams themselves are basically an opportunity to have Kaye 'do his stuff,' whether it's bits of funny business, (musical instrument) mimicry or songs. You could take out the daydream sequences and it would not affect the story itself one bit, even if later there is an instance of 'is it real or not,' which is a natural development that arises from them.

As it is there are lots of elements used in the language of genre films, the use of Karloff, the 'drive the hero/heroine insane plot,' and the film uses the pulp magazine work setting cleverly, constantly alluding to pulp fantasies in the daydreams. The daydreams have some ties to one another (most all sharing the taccata, taccata rythm and narration,) using the actors from the 'real life' sequences in different parts, and are obviously inspired by what Mitty is doing or the situation in which he finds himself at the time.

The (1947) too late-in-the-game pulp publisher offices are fantastic probably in their scale, a real life Astounding Stories office of the time would probably be a more humble affair, but it's fine as it is they do acknowledge the transition to pocket size publications (equivalent to paperback, I guess.)
In the final scenes the 'let's permit the rescue' plan strains credibility, but allows also for actual funny bits (the hand helping the foot along up the tree,) and also becomes the nudge that inspires the worm to finally turn.

The film has also been influential (though one might say that it's actually the Thurber source story that is so) probably inspiring the Ralph Phillips WB cartoons From A to Z-Z-Z (1953,) and then Boyhood Daze (1957,) these have a different tone, Mitty is always effortlessly successful whereas Ralph Philips is somewhat of a victim; possibly The Daydreamer (1966) and ultimately remade as a Ben Stiller vehicle.
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) remake is not really a bad film, although it takes the story in absolutely a different directions (even if still publishing house related - LIFE is the magazine this time) but proved unpopular upon release - a shame really.

Despite (very minor) stumbles it remains a funny Kaye vehicle and I give it a full hearted recommendation.",1447286400,,2748,4.913793103448276

This film was recently remade sadly with a slightly different plot and newer actors and I'm sorry to say it did not honor the original.

Danny Kaye shines in this film as he always does with clever voices, faces, and general quirky-ness. He's a joy to watch. And when you put jim along side the beautiful female star and the collection of obscure or interesting characters it makes for a great film.

wife, and this was one of the central points of the story.  Perhaps the heavy club of Feminism altered things.
Also, Danny Kaye is very annoying when he gibbers.  Back in the day, I guess, this was considered very
amusing.

437343,5,6302215730,"Watching the Danny Kaye version after having watched the Ben Stiller remake is a fascinating experience.  The modern remake has definite virtues - notably Stiller's little-boy-lost performance in a sophisticated world of New York advertising, as well as the subtext offering an elegy to LIFE magazine, now doomed to appear on the internet only.  On the other hand Norman Z. Mcleod's Technicolor version of the Thurber story contains one of Danny Kaye's best performances on film.  He was nothing short of a genius - a brilliant slapstick comedian, with an apparently limitless range of facial expressions, with a natural instinct for delivering comic songs full of verbal pyrotechnics.  Structurally speaking, the film has a story of sorts, but is basically a star vehicle for Kaye to show off his talents, playing a distressed sea-captain, an English flying ace (complete with cut-glass RP accent), a brilliant card-sharper (complete with cheroot) and a cowboy storming into a studio-set bound western town.  His wife Sylvia Fine provides the music and lyrics for two specialty tunes; in one of them he plays a mid-European professor impersonating most of the instruments of the orchestra.  With all this verbal and visual wizardry going on, it's hard to concentrate on the plot; but it doesn't really matter, as Kaye is such an endearing performer that he can quite easily win his way into the audience's affections, especially when he plays direct to camera as if performing in the live theater.  The film contains one or two good supporting performances, notably from Virginia Mayo as the love-interest playing several roles in Kaye/Mitty's fantastic dreams, and Boris Karloff as a crooked psychiatrist trying to push Kaye/Mitty out of the window of an upper-floor skyscraper, and then putting him under psychological influence in an attempt to extract vital information out of him.  But basically the film belongs to Kaye, a superb star vehicle for a fantastically talented actor and performer, who was as much at home in front of a live audience as he was in front of a movie camera.",1406419200,3,2089,5.105571847507331

Not many movies that my kids will watch with me all the way through. The humor of Danny Kaye and the special effects are terrific even considering the era this movie was made in.

Until watching this now, as an adult, however, I didn't realize the tremendous talent as an actor and brilliantly and naturally humorous man that he was.  Love him even more now.  Didn't really plan on liking the movie, just wanted that walk.  I got much more than I bargained for.  As a child, I also didn't notice how good looking he was, so now as I'm an adult, it was an added treat to find him appealing to watch as well as humorous, AND a brilliant actor.",1395446400,2,597,4.342342342342342

several generations I can honestly say that there are few and far between really good movies being made
as in the past.  You have your really good ones, but across the board quality is in the pits.  And the remakes

The colors are beautiful and accurate - it's perfect. This film has never looked better
on home video. I suppose a Blu-ray release would show some improvement,

Danny Kaye is wonderful as an innocent, accident prone milquetoast with a rich fantasy life. And the supporting cast is just, wow! The color and images are stunning.

The script is brilliant...tongue-in-cheek and witty in the manner of some of the best writing from films in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Ever see The Women? Same kind of laugh until you drop writing. You often get the impression there are two meanings...the ""obvious"" meaning for the general public, and the inside double meaning for the script writers and their little inside circle.

Some think Danny Kaye was gay and that his scripts have a gay double-entendre. The evidence for Kaye's queerness is much contested (lots of debate about his supposed affair with Olivier) but either way I think it's clear that screenwriters of the time were so comfortable in the invisibility of gay culture that they had fun dropping a lot of double meanings in that back then went mostly unnoticed and today are just hilarious.

Too bad this is out of print. Maybe they'll remake it. I paid $140 to get it used and I don't regret it.",1377734400,2,1168,4.71078431372549

437961,5,6302215730,""" The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty "" is defiantly a comedy classic. For all those Danny Kaye fans this movie will land in your top 5 favorite Danny Kaye.

For all those who are unfamiliar with Danny Kaye and have yet to see this movie, allow me to enlighten you.

  The plot: Murder. A book of hidden treasure. Is it reality or a dream when adventure comes knocking,or in Mitty's (Kaye's) case driving up in a cab.

  Story Line: Walter Mitty is an executive in a big billboard commercial company, who has a habit of slipping into daydreams. Mitty's life is run by his boss, his mother, his fiancee, his soon to be mother-in-law, and his fiancee's want-to-be suitor. To escape his reality, Walter Mitty's imagination takes off, altering him into the man he wishes he could be.
  Each dream phase has a different storyline with Mitty in the spotlight.
Though the back ground theme changes,three things remain; Walter Mitty has a man of action, his theme song
"" de-pock-it-tit de-pock-it-tit de-pock-it-tit,"" and the girl of his dreams(Virgina Mayo).
  Walter Mitty is taken for a spin when the girl of his dreams and he, end up sharing a cab and the girl's companion ends up mysteriously dead. Things get interesting when Mitty's dream girl (Virginia Mayo) starts seeking his help to solve the murder and catch the villain known as "" The Boot "". If that is not bad enough the situation steams up when romance between Mitty and his dream girl starts to bloom, as "" The Boot"" closes in on them and a hidden treasure.
Mitty starts to question reality verses his dream world when Mitty's dream girl disappears.
Is Mitty able to become the man of his dreams to safe the woman of his dreams, or will he walk down the aisle and say ""I do"" to his controlling fiancee?

Laugh your worries away with this hilarious Danny Kaye classic!!!! This movie is good for all ages, and as a late night movie. Watch it once and you won't be sorry. Miss out and it will TRULY BE your loss.",1351641600,,1964,4.516949152542373
437962,5,6302215730,"We loved it,hilarious,endearing,Danny Kaye was such an amazing performer, quite extraordinary how he was able to speak & sing his way through difficult complicated words so fast!! He has always been a huge favourite of ours, so now we hope to collect all his films if possible! Our favourite ones are 'The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty', & 'Hans Christian Andersen', which we have ordered & received, so we can't wait to watch it!
We received it on time, very pleased with the picture & sound, so thank you very much for the efficient postage & packaging.",1349308800,,553,4.711340206185567
437963,5,6302215730,"The problem facing the director of photography (Lee Garmes) and costume designer (Irene Sharaff) when designing this film was to transform Virginia Mayo's standard blonde sweet girl next door image into the larger than life figment of Walter Mitty's imagination. And later, when she enters his real world to turn the beauty factor one notch higher to the totally irresistible level.

The images I've uploaded show how well they succeeded.  I can't think of any other ""star"" with a complexion as perfect as Virginia Mayo and maybe this is why attention is always drawn to her head not her body.  As can be seen by looking at some of her different personas she ably plays his ever faithful dream girl but looks even more enticing as a contemporary (40's) glamour girl.

Of course it's great fun watching Kaye being bewitched during their first 3 encounters but Mayo's acting is also so effortless one hardly notices how well she plays her different characters. Best demonstrated when the Gaylord Mitty riverboat gambling dream quickly transitions into their second meeting outside his office where from being his besotted southern belle she morphs into modern seductress - instantly reversing the roles they played 2 minutes earlier.

One incongruity I still find just as bemusing as when I first saw this movie in 1948 is where did Mayo change into her perfect ensembles if she's not living with her wicked uncle in the suburbs (of California)?  Did she even have a life of her own beyond always being available to play parts in Walter Mitty's dreams?

Now I'm older the more relevant issue would be who'll figure in his dreams when they are married? Thankfully Hollywood and Jane Austen are not worried about matters connected to mundane reality.  Maybe it was purely accidental but only in the last ""just-married"" scene does Sharaff return Mayo to human-scale normality by giving her a strange half-white dress covered by an enormous black fox fur - which appears to be larger than her.

Nevertheless Mayo's earlier resplendent images and one question remain - how many other Hollywood film stars have ever looked this irresistibly feminine - in glorious Technicolor - at any time in the last 67 years?",1337212800,5,2203,4.948509485094851
437964,5,6302215730,"Once you get past the subtitles (unless you manually turn them off, they'll begin with Korean subtitles), you realize that they just don't make movies like this anymore.

437968,5,6302215730,"Although author James Thurber had serious misgivings about MGM's adaptation of his story, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947) turned out to be undeniably terrific entertainment. The wonderful Danny Kaye is perfect as Thurber's hopelessly daydreaming character as his fantasies open up visually into amusing heroics (the ""tipocketica"" sound effect thematically running through each fantasy). Seemingly, the daydreams are the only way of escape from milquetoast Walter's oppressive life, complete with a domineering mother, demanding fiance, and redundant job (writing suspense stories). The fun really begins when a woman (blond bombshell Virginia Mayo) bursts into his life, and suddenly, poor Mitty is thrust in the middle of a very real espionage situation, frought with danger. It's then fun to watch wide-eyed Kaye get tugged & pulled between what is his normal, henpecked existence, and his wobbling chance to beat the odds and become a true hero.
The supporting cast (including the sinister presence of Boris Karloff) is top notch, and the story (particularly the fantasy sequences) benefit from the bright sparkle of a glossy MGM production.
Definitely a Kaye classic that should be included in any fan's collection!",1321228800,,1228,5.502645502645502

437970,5,6302215730,"Loosely based upon James Thurber's short story.  It is said Thurber did not like the script, rewrote portions of the script, but those rewrites never saw the silver (actually color) screen.  The original story could have probably been done in thirty minutes.  This production, however, more or less, encapsulates the original story within a larger story involving Naxis and the realistic possibilites of murder and torture. The film works well as a post WWII comedy starring Danny Kaye complete with a happy ending and is, indeed an enjoyable watch.  (Read the amusing short story also.)  The picture and sound was fine.

438012,5,6302215730,"There are dozens of great Danny Kaye movies, but Secret Life of Walter Mitty to me is the best.  Some Kaye movies get a little overdone with either him doing his nutty acts or with long musical pieces (which are good but sometimes there's just too much of it), but Secret LIfe has neither of these to deter from his great acting or the fun sub-plot of him trying to prove his theory about the bad guys who are trying to kill him.  This movie is fun, fun, fun.  I had an impossible time trying to find a DVD of this movie, and I finally settled on a Korean import purchased through Amazon.  I was hesitant about this version, but to my surprise the DVD is perfect.  I think Korean subtitles appear by default, but they're easily turned off.  I understand one reason this movie is not available on DVD is because a remake is planned for 2012, so obviously a reissue will appear to promote the new movie.

438016,5,6302215730,"Danny Kaye was a comedic genius. He made many movies which highlight his tremendous skill, but none so broad in scope as this. Walter Mitty is a classic ""milktoast"" character, henpecked by his mother, his fiance and his future mother-in-law. He is also absent minded, for he is constantly dreaming up new characters for the serial fiction company at which he works. In these delightful daydreams, Mitty creates adventure stories built around his larger-than-life heroic alter-ego.

Danny Kaye plays the absent-minded milktoast character so well that you believe that this must be Kaye's true personality. But then, during the day-dreaming sequences, Kaye plays the heroic legends with such bravado, such pinache, that you realize the full scope of Danny Kaye's talent. This is the perfect showcase for a man of his enormous skill.

I have always believed that comedic acting is more difficult than dramatic acting. Our modern times have seen the proof of this, with the invention of the come-drama, and with so many comedic actors making the transition to drama and scoring multiple Oscars for their preformances. Comedy requires a range of acting skills from subtle to flamboyant in order to be truly successful at it. Danny Kaye was a brilliant performer, on a par with any we have produced today, and this was one of his proudest moments.",1259712000,3,1341,5.0633484162895925

438074,4,6302215730,"One of the all time classic comedic actors, Danny Kaye gives a charming and varied performance as day dreamer Walter Mitty. A helpless hopeful who works for a publishing company and constanly gets himself into trouble by dreaming his life more fantastic. Whether it be doctor, fighter pilot or gambling gentleman, he becomes the man he wishes he could be but is absolutely not. Charming, debonaire, brave and sophisticated. The real Walter Mitty posesses none of these attributes.

Things take a turn for him though as he finds himself mixed up with a beautiful woman who's in trouble and involved in a dangerous plan to retrieve a book containing locations for some hidden WWII paintings. A former nazi named ""The Boot"" is also aware of the book and will kill anyone in the way of securing it for himself.

Unfortunately for Walter, no one knows or believes his story as these people who constantly call on him for help are never around when anyone else is. His Boss, co-workers, and family all chalk it up to his wild imaginations and story writing career. This all makes for some funny moments where Walters secret life soon becomes his real life. But nobody knows it but him.

Danny Kaye does a wonderful job of selling every performance he's asked to. Every character he plays is totally different from the other and is a tribute to his versitility. He absolutely sells this movie and makes it work. A great performance. Keep an eye out for Boris Karloff in his psychiatrist role as well.

The disc works well for what it is. The color looks very good and natural. Overall, it's pretty clean and doesn't cause any unnecessary distractions. The audio is typically mono and focused to the front speakers. Everything is clearly heard and distinguishable. The score and dialog come across loud and clear.

This is a fun film for all ages. It works very well and can easily be watched again and again. Highly recommended.",1200614400,30,1921,4.756756756756757
438075,2,6302215730,"This film was inspired by the short stories of James Thurber. Walter Mitty drives to the train station in a small NJ town that resembles southern California. Mitty works for a publishing company in Manhattan that prints racy detective stories and other popular magazines (classified as ""escapist"" literature). Mitty's daydreams are interspersed with his real life. An imagined operation has comic touches. His fiance's dog doesn't trust him. His furnace has logs that burn quickly (unlike in the real world). Mitty's comic musician seems quite outdated. On his morning train he meets a strange woman who ask for his help. Mitty's life quickly becomes complicated, far more than in any daydream. He has become involved in dangerous situation. Will he survive?

The story continues with comic scares and scenes. They now seek a missing notebook that was placed into a woman's corset. Scenes switch from reality to fantasy. Does Mitty need a psychiatrist? Does his job affect his imagination? The film runs on with more scenes of comic terror. At the end there is a surprise. This film tells what Hollywood thought would please customers. Did it? This isn't a good parody of suspense thrillers where an ordinary man stumbles into danger.",1193184000,,1234,5.108910891089109
438076,5,6302215730,"Yes! We all have been in a state of imginary circumstances, because at the time real life didn't hold our interest. The comedic skills of Danny Kaye as Walter Mitty lets us view a few of James Thurber's scenarios into a stage of dreams and then into a bit of reality. I too am dreaming of being a reviewer.",1189296000,,306,4.203389830508475
438077,4,6302215730,"I have been in love with this film since I first saw it on TV when I was a child. It is one of those classic Hollywood comedies that just makes you happy. It's got so much going for it: the incomparable Danny Kaye, a hilarious premise involving dangerous jewel thieves, lovely Virginia Mayo, wonderful fantasy/daydream sequences, and the sinister Boris Karloff.

Danny Kaye is completely in his element here, playing a nervous wimp who escapes his dull life (controlling mother, and tedious job at the paperback publishing company) through daydreams of romance and adventure.

Until I saw this movie I had no idea how very gifted Kaye was. He can make a reaction to toast popping up seem hysterically funny. His timing and acting are brilliant, and his physical comedy is formidable.

I just wish that he had made more comedy films in the 40's and 50's. But I suppose it's better to have done a few brilliant gems than a whole bunch of decent movies.

I also recommend his films ""Wonder Man"", ""The Court Jester"", ""The Inspector General"", and also ""Knock on Wood"" (that last one is basically impossible to find anymore, so I wish they'd do a box set of his dvd movies!)...",1179964800,36,1171,4.669902912621359
438078,5,6302215730,"For you Danny Kaye fans, well you know all about this anyway.  For those looking for a good family movie, this is it.  Perhaps not Kayes best work, but near the top.  Great screen adaptation of Thurbers short story.  Movie stands alone and is easily identified with by us ""dreamers"" out here.  Do recommend a read of the original short story for a more complete understanding of where this character came from and how well Kaye protrays this mild mannered man and brings him to life.",1149465600,,483,4.569767441860465
438079,5,6302215730,"Need someone to save the girl from a vicious blackmailer in a western? Walter Mitty is here. Need a highly skilled doctor to perform a nerve-racking surgery while up against the clock? Walter Mitty is the man. Need an expertly skilled air pilot to fly in World War 2, or a comedian/entertainer to help all the boys forget about the war with his little musical number? Yes, you guessed it: Walter Mitty.

This is by far one of my favorite stories to read and best loved films. Based on James Thurber's story, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty stretches this story into a 100 minute feature film. Reportedly Thurber didn't like the movie too much, but, honestly, I believe there is little not to love in this movie. It does a superb job projecting the character Walter Mitty Thurber seemed to want to create. There is quite a deal more depth given to this character in the movie, and this is a good thing. Instead of just being a simple-minded man who dreams away from his uneventful life and wife to bigger and better things, this Walter Mitty leads two lives-the real, and the dream-which seemingly interconnect during the film.

There are subtle differences from the short story. For instance, Walter's wife (in the story) is replaced with his nagging mother in the film. He is going to be married, and is not only nagged by his mother but also his fianc?. However, after he witnesses a murder, he begins to question what is real and what illusion is, including the girl of his dreams (Virginia Mayo).

Another superb aspect of the film is simply the performance by Danny Kaye. Kaye embodies the very essence of Walter Mitty so well-there are the goofy moments when he nervously struggles to get away from danger, the entertaining parts where he is singing about musical devices, or showing the latest fashion, and the adventurous scenes where he is trying to help his damsel-in-distress escape countless villains (one of which is played by none other than villain legend Boris Karloff).

Another great thing about the film is its quality. The DVD is in excellent quality, sound, transfer and color are fantastic. I'm so glad they brought this classic to DVD.

This is an exceptional movie for the family to enjoy, or just a movie to cheer you up. It definitely has the comedic flavor that we expect from Danny Kaye films.

I think we can all associate with the dreamer in Walter Mitty, because we all want to be heroic in some way.",1146528000,116,2431,4.655011655011655
438080,4,6302215730,"When I saw this in 1947 or '48 I thought it was more hilarious than anything I'd ever seen before. I thought the same of Up in Arms, Knock on Wood, The Court Jester, and all Kaye vehicles. I must have been more innocent in those far-off days, and, sadly, it is now not quite as good as I then thought it; in fact, memory had enhanced the classic scenes and the dream sequences had got even better over time, so that when I saw them again they were faintly disappointing. Still, anyone viewing the film for the first time should find it hugely enjoyable; and it is famous enough for the Walter Mitty Syndrome to have entered the language. The Thurber story is a greater work of art, and it is unsurprising that he disliked the way his wistful and ironic little invention had become distorted. The most memorable parts of the film were those wonderful, heroic fantasies: ""I'm taking her through: my arm is broken, but it's nothing""; ""Ach, Himmel, it is Valter der Mitty: I'm done for""; Walter ""Slim"" Mitty (the Mitty Kid) ""I wouldn't do that if I were you""; ""Coreopsis has set in""; ""Swallow 'em up, ole Mississippi --- mah regiment leaves at dawn"";  but none of them quite matched up to the way I remembered them. Too bad --- it's still a classic, and I won't be garnering too many votes in agreement. Kaye was still some sort of genius, though.",1125446400,,1343,4.437246963562753
438100,5,6302215730,Danny kaye was a gifted physical comedian and Walter Mitty is one of his best roles.  He dreams because his life is not too exciting. I think lots of people can relate to this. Walter is brave when in his real life he is not. Then he meets Virginia Mayo (a beautiful blonde) who just happens to be his dream girl come alive. The story is universal and makes the viewer laugh 90% of the time. For all ages. Terrific!,1111190400,3,415,4.1875
438101,5,6302215730,"While WONDER MAN and THE COURT JESTER might be more consistently wacky, I thought THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (TSLoWM) brought out the vulnerable side of Danny Kaye, one of my faves since childhood (I never missed any of Kaye's movies on WPIX when I was growing up). It usually gets on my nerves when I see movie characters allowing themselves to be as put-upon and henpecked as Kaye's Walter is here, but there was a sweetness about him that made me root for him instead of merely growling, ""Oh, tell 'em all to go to hell already"" -- and as a result, it's that much more satisfying when Walter finally does tell off his obnoxious so-called friends and loved ones (unlike such ""comedies of cruelty"" as MADHOUSE, where the last 10 minutes of Revenge Against The Oppressors are the only entertaining parts of the movie)! Although James Thurber, another of my faves, reportedly tried to buy off producer Samuel Goldwyn to keep the film from being made and hated the finished product, I think perhaps Thurber wasn't being quite fair.  First off, books and film have different storytelling requirements, and second, the first 10 minutes are almost straight from Thurber's story (except it's Walter and his nagging mom instead of a nagging wife), and it seemed to me that the characters and performances had very Thurberesque qualities about them. Boris Karloff and Konstantin Shayne are delightfully unctuous villains (Fun Fact:  their henchman, Henry Corden, later became the voice of Fred Flintstone!). As Walter's literal and figurative dream girl Rosalind van Hoorn, frequent Kaye co-star Virginia Mayo was thoroughly beguiling and never looked lovelier (and hey, the radiant Mayo was a size 12 and nobody considered *her* a ""plus size,"" thank you very much! :-). TSLoWM also contains two of my favorite Kaye/Sylvia Fine musical numbers: ""Symphony for Unstrung Tongue"" (am I the only one who finds the line ""He gets so excited that he has a solo passage"" to be subtly salacious? :-) and ""Anatole of Paris."" To top it all off, it takes place primarily in my hometown and favorite city, New York City, and is set in one of my favorite milieus, pulp magazine publishing!  My hubby and I like to think that Uncle Peter's grand home must be located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where we used to live, since it looks like the kind of houses we used to see while walking around in the Fieldston area and it didn't seem to take horrifically long for Walter and Rosalind to drive there from the Flatiron district of Manhattan! :-)  (Interestingly, the interior of the van Hoorn home looks a lot like the interior of evil Bruno Anthony's home in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN; anybody know if these scenes might have been shot in the same house/set?) I wish the DVD extras had included deleted scenes (there's a bit in the trailer with Karloff and Corden in a pub that I definitely don't recall seeing in the finished film), but it was nice to see Virginia Mayo still alive and well (and bigger than ""size 12,"" but on her it's pleasant plumpness, in my opinion! :-) in the intro and outro, even though she only had time to say one line about most of her co-stars (""Ann Rutherford was delightful...Fay Bainter was a consummate actress..."").",1101254400,33,3234,4.749110320284697

438103,4,6302215730,"Probably one of Danny kayes best known movies, and never seems to lose it's charm. A very thin story line is beautifully padded by the multiple personalities played out in the daydreams of our erstwhile anti-hero. A wonderful cameo from Boris Karloff adds to the comic excitement of a fast paced story, and Kaye delivers brilliantly with impeccable timing during each sub plot. Almost a multiple picture in picture movie, the ending really holds no suprises, but gently jogs the viewer along, without some of the kitch so prevalent in other movies of the era. Danny Kaye really was a comic genius, and in some ways the picture reflects his own life which was widely believed to be that of a painfully shy and reserved man. A great family film, my daughters aged 12 and 14 actually stayed glued to the film throughout, proving that ""old fashioned"" homely family films can stand the test of time with contemporary audiences.
