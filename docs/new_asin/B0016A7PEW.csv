3155218,5,B0016A7PEW,"This beautiful Qi Gong practice is a natural continuation of Lees first video in this series, Qi Gong Flow for beginners. . . Lee Holden has a peaceful, gentle, presence, and his slow flowing movements bring a sense of calm as he leads you to gently increase your range of motion and improve muscle tone, while improving the flow of blood, chi and lymph.  This video series is extremely well produced and the movements well-paced with the rhythm of the breath. The natural setting that forms the background is truly spectacular...and adds immeasurably to the overall quality and benefits of this production.
The photographer blends in views water and the surrounding beauty in a way that makes you feel like you enjoying a retreat, immersing yourself into the beauty, peace, and deep relaxation of this practice.
I've practiced yoga for many years and done some Tai Chi, but Lee Holden's Qi Gong videos have taken me to a new level, improving my physical comfort and sense of well-being.  Lee is an excellent teacher.
 I also recommend Lees other excellent Qi Gong videos:  Deeper Flow, Qi Gong for Joints and Bones and Moving Meditation.  I rotate among these and other Lee Holden videos from the Exercise to Heal series as part of my daily practice.  Highly recommended  my very favorite Qi Gong Instructor!",1385337600,4,1309,4.86936936936937
3155219,4,B0016A7PEW,"for a senior student like me, Lee keeps the feet and legs pretty much static throughout with a few exceptions--this means about 30 minutes of standing in one place though the arms torso  and hands move a lot.  it would be nice to have a little more tai-chi-type movement of feet and legs just to keep it a little more active.",1381795200,4,325,4.311475409836065
3155220,4,B0016A7PEW,"I saw him on PBS.  I have limited movement in my back and some of the movements I cannot do.  But the rest of it is extremely helpful.  It brings great peace and revitalization.

 I like him. He really loves what he's doing.  He's for real.",1380326400,2,240,4.108695652173913

3155223,5,B0016A7PEW,The Flow Continues is a wonderful DVD.  The exercises are executed beautifully and the narrator gives pointers that are very helpful in letting you know if you are doing the motions correctly.  I did the program with two friends as a morning practice and felt a definite increase in energy and a decrease in tension in my body upon competion.,1263686400,5,342,4.683333333333334

8261983,5,B0016A7PEW,"I stumbled upon Qi Gong and Lee Holden more or less accidentally (on YouTube) and am so glad I did.  This is the most enjoyable form of exercise I have ever found - more like a moving meditation than exercise.  The slow, flowing moves just feel good to do.  His voice is pleasant.  The movements are generally easy to follow.  I have several Lee Holden DVDs; they are all good, but this one is my favorite so far.",1517443200,,413,4.243589743589744

8261988,3,B0016A7PEW,I would rate this higher if you could select another program after the first one is over.  The DVD ends and you have to start over watch all the info screens AGAIN before you can select another program.,1458950400,,202,4.315789473684211
