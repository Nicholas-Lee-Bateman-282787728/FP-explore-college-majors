8599285,4,B00DYWI97M,"Vile, crude and intensely human, this film captures how a lot of groups of people work when it comes to debasing individuals. This film allows the viewer to think for itself and offers no easy way out. Well made, but too unfocused for my taste, in the end.",1392768000,,256,4.354166666666667
8599286,4,B00DYWI97M,"Written and directed by Michel Franco, After Lucia (Despus de Luca) follows the story of a middle-aged chef Roberto (Hernn Mendoza) and his 17-year-old daughter Alejandra (Tessa Ia). They have just left Puerto Vallarta and moved into Mexico City, in order to shake off sad memories and start a new life.

Things go well at first, apparently. But Robert barely manages to suppress a fit of violent emotion, and though he is a loving father, he seems caught up with his sadness, not noticing what is happening to his daughter. In the meanwhile, a video of Alejandra and her friend Jose (Gonzalo Vega Jr.) making love is posted online by someone, and Alejandra is subjected to bullying by other pupils. Determined not to worry her depressed father, Alejandra chooses not to report it to school or her father, but her action makes the situation even worse.

This is Mexican director Michel Francos sophomore work as a feature director, and his camerawork (he prefers longer take) and matter-of-fact approach to the disturbing subject matter may remind you of such director as Gus Van Sant (especially Elephant) and Michael Haneke. Michel Franco tells the story with confidence, describing violence with realism. Tessa Ia (The Burning Plain) and the entire cast all did a great job.

After Lucia is a film that is not easy to sit through. Its a chilling look at reality of life. Frankly this is not my cup of tea, but is stull fascinating.",1387065600,,1434,4.844897959183673
