8319487,5,B001LQFI2C,"This DVD is great for someone like me who's just starting out in Parkour. The directions are easy to follow, & you learn several different moves.",1386028800,3,145,4.615384615384615
8319488,4,B001LQFI2C,"Being the only video i could find in Parkour, i didn't have much of a choice when i bought it.  I was hoping to use it to help my meetup group figure out how to perform some of the moves.  It did help a little, but i felt it could have been so much more.",1258588800,4,254,3.6
8319489,5,B001LQFI2C,"Despite the previous comments on this DVD being too basic, I found it perfect as a mature beginner. The commentary was totally intelligent and gave a high level of tuition. If the moves are ""basic"" that's exactly where the beginner starts. Great work and exactly what the title promises. Now... how about something similar on parkour conditioning? I look forward to it.",1256083200,16,369,4.967741935483871
8319490,5,B001LQFI2C,"I found this DVD to be very disappointing. Ofcourse I've been doing parkour for 6 years so, you can see why.

Let me explain. This DVD is WONDERFUL if you are a newcomer to the Parkour scene...Get it, I wish I had this DVD when I was a newcomer, it discusses what to do and what NOT to do, VERY ACCURATELY. Its a VERY well compiled DVD.

This DVD is recommended for beginners, especially if you want to learn the basics. Be warned its only 45 mins long, its very detailed though.

I DO NOT recommend you getting this if you are an experienced freerunner, You will just be reviewing the basics of parkour.

This could potentialy become a newcomers necessity.",1255392000,37,657,4.404958677685951
8319491,3,B001LQFI2C,"This is a well made, ultra basic guide to parkour.  It is only 45 minutes of repetitive basics anyone can do.  If you do parkour or have confidence in your body this one is useless.  They don't even have any footage of decent freerunning.  Would someone with some skill please make a decent parkour dvd?  Jump London and Journeys are unavailable in the US.  So far the market is wide open for someone here to make a truly inspirational piece.  From B-boys to Freerunners America seems to be out of breath and lookin' tired.  What's up with that?  If the material world has got you down invest in something spiritual, or at least invest in your potential.  True Parkour like dance,yoga and martial arts is a high level practice that expresses the ultimate in human endeavors.  To express one's whole self into something without thought of reward or compensation is the greatest of human attributes. Now will someone make a freerunning dvd with some soul?  This one is like a ""dummy's guide"".  If you are brand new to this and haven't done much agility training however, this one is definitely helpful.",1243641600,8,1100,4.696335078534031
