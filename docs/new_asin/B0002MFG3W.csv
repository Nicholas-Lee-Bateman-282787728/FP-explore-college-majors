This is a great, great documentary.  You will learn about the religion of candomble, which is a blend of catholicism and African rituals in Bahia, Brazil.  This was a big influence for David Byrne during the ""Rei Momo"" period(and probably continues to be).  The rhythms and dances these people do are nothing short of the DNA of rock and roll. You will also learn more about what makes David Byrne tick. As an example, it suddenly makes perfect sense why he would choose Whitney Houston's ""I just wanna dance with somebody"" as a cover song in concert. Finally, I dare say, you'll learn about life.",1099008000,35,744,4.56390977443609
8029273,3,B0002MFG3W,"This film is very interesting to watch. It presents a lot of different traditions, rituals, and cultural practices of the Candombl and how it has influenced the people of Brazil in their own practices. It is very evident of the impact that the Candombl has on the people of Brazil. The film has different clips focused on dancing, rituals to different gods and their meanings, as well as interactions of the people in their community. I found it very interesting how women were respected and given such an important role and men also had their own traditions and roles in the community. I really enjoyed watching this film. I loved that people talked in their native tongue and they weren't shy of showing their culture.",1522281600,,720,4.768
8029274,3,B0002MFG3W,"I have really mixed feelings about this film; though it very well may be because of my social/cultural biases as a westerner. I found it really confusing/strange that the majority of the documentary isn't presented in the typical, structured way as pretty much every other documentary Ive seen. Its not really narrated, so much as a random array of images that don't make much sense to me personally. But then again, after watching it again more carefully, I realized that maybe that was the point  because thats how the Candomble convey their religion, through music and dance, not words. I find the documentary to respectfully, artistically, and most importantly, accurately reflects the tribe being studied, and prompts the viewer to humanize what seems a world a way in a new, beautiful light. Would definitely recommend for older audiences that can try to consciously go into the film with as blank a slate as possible!",1522281600,,924,5.0
8029275,4,B0002MFG3W,"Admittedly this film was more than interesting, it was immersive. This makes me think that the musical part of the entire experience plays a huge role, especially in the possession aspect. The music may signify and trigger some trance-like state in which this possession may first take place, however it was a good change of pace to see actual religious possession that does not involve demons or a little girl's head doing a complete 360-degree spin. Byrne really captured the essence of the Il Aiy and their Afro roots in combination with Catholicism. Also, particularly the way he formatted the films in these sort of compilations helped to focus on one area or subject at a time.",1522281600,,683,4.846153846153846
8029276,4,B0002MFG3W,Wonderful documentary.,1453680000,,22,10.5
8029277,2,B0002MFG3W,"This was quite disappointing. I'm famliar with the religion and this video was just boring. There are definitely other sources available (for free on youtube) that have better depictions of the rites that are practiced, as well as explanations.",1412467200,,244,5.282051282051282
8029278,4,B0002MFG3W,This video gets straight to the point. It opens and closes with a bang and was worth every penny. Any age group can watch it.,1354147200,,125,4.04
8029279,3,B0002MFG3W,"There is some very good information in this film but it lacks chapters or scenes making it very difficult to locate that information on replay. It is also not really a documentary in the ordinary sense, falling somewhere between an Art Film and a compilation of shorts about various aspects of Brazilian religious beliefs. The visuals and music are interesting but often, as is the case with the first song, they run longer than your interest in the subject given the limited explanation provided. Chapter headings would also have given the viewer a better idea of how the parts relate to each other. I don't doubt that David Byrne was very well versed on this subject. Unfortunately, having that knowledge can make it harder to see the gaps in understanding experienced by a less well educated audience.",1306368000,3,804,4.875912408759124
8029280,3,B0002MFG3W,"Maybe ""Ile Aiye"" is some kind of code for David Byrne took his camcorder to some of the most remote parts of South America and filmed lots of dancing, drum playing and trance like singing.

No Talking Heads, no David Byrne, no subtitles, no translation, no music you would even understand... You're on you own on this one and you'll find yourselves looking numerous times at your airline tickets saying ""when does this jet depart so I can get the hell out of here?""

Unless the theme of this video is something you are ABSOLUTELY familiar with, don't waste your time or money.

You can save your money and watch programs like this on the ""foreign culture channel"".",1266105600,4,664,4.610169491525424
8029281,2,B0002MFG3W,I watched this once and yawned. I love David Byrne but this didn't do much for me.,1237075200,,82,3.8823529411764706
8029282,5,B0002MFG3W,"To me, Kandomble represents one of the best ways to experience and share religious feeling - a spiritual path where the entire body celebrates through music, rhythm and trance. Clearly, Byrne has been hooked as well.

This DVD represents a collage of images, syncopations, sweaty bodies, images of saints and possessed old ladies, filmed and collated with affection and deep sympathy. At times I thought I glimpsed a sparseness in the spaces between the narrative and the image, a holding back from being swept from holding the camera into the dance frenzy, that sort of reminded me of Werner Herzog. Ile Aiye's narrative is removed out of the ordinary into a place which is neither here nor there. Some might attribute such an approach to lack of concern with craftsmanship, but Byrne pulls it off relatively well. This film makes me want to BE THERE, in Salvador de Bahia, moving together with those bodies that were designed to move and to worship, to celebrate the ecstasy of being  filled with the force of life. The words themselves, Oshun, Yemaya, Exu, Xango, Omulu...  dance away effortlessly from the tongue...

Well worth seeing.",1196640000,15,1139,4.947643979057592
