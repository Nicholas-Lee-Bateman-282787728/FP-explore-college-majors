4336996,4,B004EFX35G,"I am a fan of JJ's workouts (she's second to Jillian Michaels IMHO) so I was excited to cop this DVD.  It's a total of 60 minutes in length.  The first 30 minutes are pure cardio in boot camp style.  It's intense and is a good workout for a low-intermediate and up fitness level.  The final 30 minutes is all strength - I used 5 lbs. weights.

Very straightforward workout that you can alternate on busy days (30 mins of cardio on Mondays & Weds; 30 mins of strength on Tues & Thurs).  If you really want a challenge, do all 60 minutes.  Either way, JJ is going to work you out!",1341273600,2,578,4.107142857142857
4336997,5,B004EFX35G,"I just completed this workout for the first time and it is amazing! Jeanette Jenkins is a great instructor and keeps you motivated through this hour long intense workout. The first 35 minutes include a warm up and cardio portion. The cardio portion includes kickboxing, basketball inspired exercises, and several unique moves such as a burpee to pushup to side plank, and several high intensity cardio moves that were new to me and believe me I own a lot of exercise dvds. The best thing about this dvd is that the moves are never repetitive and the time really flies by. It's an intense workout but it is so much fun that it makes it easy to get through the full hour. The last portion consists of toning. Jeanette uses combination exercises with 3 to 5 pound dumbbells to tone your entire body. Then she takes it to the mat for some leg and ab work. My heart rate was elevated the entire time. At the end there is a great stretch segment to cool down. Of all my 70 plus dvds this is definitely a new favorite and I will use it often. I'll have to buy more Jeanette Jenkins workouts.",1337904000,6,1084,4.371287128712871
4336998,5,B004EFX35G,"Jeanette keeps you moving with this total body, non-stop workout. If you've done any of her other videos you'll recognize many of the moves but believe me when I say the intensity and consistent pace are present and make it tough! The one-on-one instruction is a nice change from her usual format. This is now one of my favorites.",1327622400,,330,4.610169491525424
4336999,5,B004EFX35G,"I know everyone likes Jillian Michaels, but her workouts are not as productive as Jeanette Jenkins.  Yes I said it.  With Jeanette's bootcamp you receive an HOUR workout and it is intense.  It is non-stop cardio!  It also features a variety of moves and really gets your heart rate high.  The weight section is equally as nice.  Not the few reps Jillian does.  You will see results if you use the correct amount of weights.  I like all of her DVD's because you get a good cardio workout and weight workout instead of the cardio and weights put together in a less than 20 minute program.  Also try the bikini beach body and blast the belly fat workouts.",1304035200,6,652,4.4576271186440675
4337000,3,B004EFX35G,"I have several Jeannette videos and was disappointed with this one. It seems as if the entire aerobics portion was recorded without the music, with music being randomly selected an added in the editing process.  The music is completely inappropriate for most of the moves and Jeannette certainly does not have an internal metronome; she is not able to keep a steady pace. Very disappointng. The strength training portion is good.

There are tons great, inexpensive videos out there. If I had it to do over again, I'd pass on this one.",1299542400,3,534,4.793478260869565
4337001,3,B004EFX35G,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

I have quite a few other workout DVDs from this instructor --- she usually delivers a challenging workout and this is also good (although not as tough as some of her others.)

Why does this workout have no audible music?  It is weird.  Not motivating at all.  Instructor is good but does not have the voice for shouting and her voice gets whiny/shrieky, so a music only option would solve a lot of problems.",1298419200,2,463,4.530120481927711
4337002,4,B004EFX35G,"Hi Amazon,

I've heard about Jeanette from a youtube video about ""The Hollywood Trainer"". I did my research and found out that I liked Jeanette's style and push when it comes to her workouts. I purchased this workout wishing that it had a video along with it to see some moves or music which would be on the DVD. Unfortunately, there weren't any offered my Amazon, so I had to just bite the bullet and hope for the best.

This workout is pretty tough. I am a mid twenties lady with a history of working out- gym classes, weight classes, and Jillian Michaels workout DVD-user. This DVD was a challenge. The toughest move for me was the burpee, into a push up, side plank to the sky (holding hand up), then repeat. Boy, I haven't mustered the energy or will for that move yet.

She really just keeps you moving. No breaks, no water, no stretching in between moves. I guess that's what the PAUSE button is for :) She elevates your heartrate, lets you do a more low impact move, then repeat. LOL.

This DVD is an hr and it is split into kickboxing and then a weights portion. I haven't made it to the weights portion because I've always been too tired....but next time- it's happening.:)

PS- This DVD is different in the way that Jeanette is the ONLY person you'll watch and see in the video, no backup exercisers, no people with modifications. She's the only one.",1297036800,11,1361,4.428
4337003,4,B004EFX35G,"Thought it was a great workout.  Liked Jeanette Jenkins, she is not annoying like some of the trainers are. However, didn't really like the ""basketball drills""  Thought they were kind of boring and didn't really feel like I got anything out of that part which I now fast forward through.  Loved the boxing and toning with weights segment as well as the abs segment.  It is a good DVD to switch things up from my usual work-out routines.",1296000000,,436,4.551282051282051
4337004,5,B004EFX35G,"Jeanette Jenkins is like the personal trainer you've always hoped for: cheerful, fully engaged and pleasantly surprising. She mixes up the moves with basketball, football and classic cardio-inspired combinations without being overly chipper or ""cardio video"" predictable.  She keeps your body guessing while she sweats it up with you. No breaks, sarcasm, or faux effort; just a great, well-guided workout.  She's the real deal and really, really excellent at what she does.",1293840000,10,473,5.555555555555555
8426846,4,B004EFX35G,"This is a good video, and it is tough.  My first DVD from Jennette Jenkins and I will purchase another.",1483833600,,103,4.15

8426850,4,B004EFX35G,"I purchased this due to the great reviews it had and I'm glad I did.  The first time I did it, I thought it was a little too easy.  I must not have been doing it right because the 2nd time really kicked my tail.  I like Jeanette's personality very much.  She's motivating without being annoying.  The reps are longer than reps in some of the typical workouts I do (Jessica Smith, the firm), but it wasn't boring long (like Jeri love IMO).  It's long, so I can't do it on weekdays because I rarely have 60 minutes before work, but it is in my weekend rotation.  I think she is in amazing shape and enjoy seeing instructors who are healthy and strong in appearance.  Other reviewers complain of the music, but I didn't notice music at all.  Which is agreeably not ideal.  I also felt like her counts were off at times and not consistent.  But these aren't deal breakers.  All in all, it's not my favorite, but I think it's a really good workout.",1387843200,3,943,4.295454545454546
8426851,4,B004EFX35G,I would give this 5 stars but there is too much jumping for me. At 52 my knees cant take it. The rest of the vid is fun and really gets the breath going. Jeanette is a fun instructor.,1382659200,,183,3.717948717948718
8426852,4,B004EFX35G,"Seems like it will be a great workout when I get to that level.  I'm a beginner and this is SOOOOO out of my league, I don't know what I was thinking.",1377993600,2,150,3.6875
8426853,5,B004EFX35G,I just love Jeanette Jenkins workout DVD's.  This is a great workout and she makes it fun to do as well.,1373673600,,104,3.9523809523809526
8426854,5,B004EFX35G,"I know some people state she can be a little brash, I like Ms. Jenkins. I get a GREAT workout with her dvds, I own four of them, I
think they're DEFINITELY worth the money! Beware: they are expensive!",1367452800,,200,4.153846153846154
8426855,3,B004EFX35G,"I've had this video for over 2 years and last night was my second time doing it because of a serious dread factor I experience every time I put it in.  I'm an intermediate when it comes to fitness levels and with this dvd I am drenched with sweat and thoroughly exhausted after the full workout, which I like so the problem isn't that.  I initially thought it was because there's just ""one of her"", lol.  I like a group setting much more but that wasn't the problem either.  It was the god-awful background music with her being completely out of touch with it.  It makes her pace ok and then wicked fast and I just can't deal.

When I did the dvd last night though I enjoyed it a great deal and welcome it into my dvd rotation.  It's only because I smartened up and turned on the radio to listen to other music, that it was enjoyable.  It's the only way to make this dvd less insufferable, I'm sorry if that's harsh.

On a brighter note, the moves were unique and worked me out and I adore Jeanette's personality.  I agree with the reviewer who said Jeanette is better than Jillian too.  Her dvds seem to be a much more solid, intermediate-advanced workout.  Jillian does nothing to elevate my heartrate where Jeanette kills me in the first 10 minutes.",1360195200,3,1252,4.372294372294372
