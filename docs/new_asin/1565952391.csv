7796691,5,1565952391,"Let's all go back to 1999.  This is a thoughtful, thought provoking introduction to sensuality. A reminder for some about what sex should be.  For young and old and just plain bored, this a good film to add to your collection, or begin it.  I ordered more for friends and family.",1409788800,,279,4.431372549019608
7796692,1,1565952391,"Seriously, we were laughing but only for a couple of minutes. Hairiness less us to think that this was a very old attempt at helping couples but it was just not a good DVD - period. We gave it away to my brother.",1391385600,,212,3.953488372093023
7796693,4,1565952391,It's not much of a secret but it's a decent general overview of ideas you should consider as a couple.  It's best to get this after you're in a relationship with some already to benefit from it.  Not recommended if you're just looking for a porm video.  The video quality is old 1990's but alright as long as you can appreciate the content.,1189036800,7,340,4.365079365079365
7796694,4,1565952391,"""Playboy - Best Kept Sex Secrets"" (or at least it claims to have the ""best kept sex secrets""), is the greatest Playboy video I've ever seen, but not the best instructional video (it doesn't even come  close).
From watching this video, I get the impression that it is geared  more towards women. There are some sex tips for guys and for both couples,  but it seems more of the tips are for women on how to please men. Some of  these tips for women can also be used by men. Overall, the tips are very  informative (although in some cases, they are not enough...).
The couples  shown in the film are very attractive (which makes it hard to follow what  the narrators is saying, due to the fact that your attention might move  from the narrators to the couples). In fact, some sex experts complain that  Playboy hires only attractive couples to do these sex videos for them. It's  almost as if Playboy is saying that only attractive people have sex, when,  in real life, both attrative and not-so-attractive people have sex. The  attractiveness of these couples made me wonder if they are real, or just  actors. I think I found several hints which made it point towards them  being actors (e.g. there's one scene where a woman repeated what the  narrator just said... Coincidence? I think not!). There are also several  hints that point to them being real couples, but there are way too many  hints that suggest these people are acting.
When they get to talking  about oral sex, genitals are not shown. It is not surprising really, as it  has become obvious, through their past videos, that Playboy is not into  that sort of thing.
I really enjoyed watching the video. The film  quality is excellent, even on VHS. The music chosen for each scene blends  well with those scenes, and the narrators (both man and woman) seem to know  what they are talking about. I learned something from this video that I  didn't know before.",962841600,40,1919,4.592920353982301
