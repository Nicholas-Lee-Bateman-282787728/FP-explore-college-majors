6493588,4,B00LNMJL72,"This is sort like Charlie's Angels but in Korea during the Josean period. It's a cool movie about female bounty hunters who are assigned to retrieve a mystical object for the king. The action is good and the girls are beautiful, smart, and awesome! The story also has a twist in the end that concerns the leader of the girls. In all the movie is great, only the dvd is in widescreen and the subtitles are a little off just a couple of times. But if you can over look that it's fine.",1421366400,6,482,4.193548387096774

6493591,3,B00LNMJL72,"A 2014 Korean film The Huntresses features three female bounty hunters in period costumes: Jin-ok (Ji-won Ha), Hong-don (Ye-won Kang) and Gabi (Ga-in Son). Led by their John Bosley-like leader Mu-myeong (Chang-Seok Ko), the three huntresses next job is to retrieve a special instrument that contains a secret  secret that might change the fate of the royal family and the whole country.

The action comedy is in short a Charlies Angels in the historical setting (probably around the seventeenth century Joseon Dynasty). The Huntresses starts out promisingly with a few action/comedy set-pieces with several silly and enjoyable gadgets, but the film gets bogged down by slow pacing and poor storytelling.

The Huntresses attempts to give a new twist to the genre conventions (one of the female warriors is married, for instance), but these ideas are not fully explored, sidelined by the darker (and more boring) story about the past of one character. The action scenes are decent, and three leads are all very good, especially Ji-won Ha with a sword, but don't expect the intense martial action of Donnie Yen here.",1409097600,3,1113,5.138121546961326

If you are not used to Korean movies or dramas, then you are not versatile to other cultures and thoughts. Take a seat and enjoy. Its funny and has a good plot.just like Charlie's angels.
