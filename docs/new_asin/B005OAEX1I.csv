8481064,5,B005OAEX1I,"I have bought many steam videos here on Amazon in the past. They were invariably shot on home 8 mm cameras without sound and were chance shots taken near railroad tracks.

This one is completely different (not in the Monty Python sense). All of the film was shot on 16 mm cameras and most of them were sound types and used color film.

Over half of the time is a BBC documentary series. It has a lot of detailed technical information. Since the BBC and the railroad were government agencies, they cooperated. The camera crew went into areas that the public was excluded. The trains were run past in come cases a few times so that different shots could be taken.

Other parts of the 15 hours is a modern photography of different scale model real steam powered railroads.(engines and cars being two or three feet high)

Two hours is about steam railroads in Europe.

One hour is about a steam engine that is still run on the Union Pacific railroad.",1330473600,18,946,4.508771929824562
