4260269,4,B004478YJY,"As others have noted, the quality of the production is lacking and the music is not just a little nerve shredding, but the volume of techniques is considerable, which isn't always the case with MA DVDs. Kris Wilder is a wonderful martial arts teacher who has put out some fantastic books, as well a highly polished DVD titled The Way of Sanchin Kata: The Application of Power.

Sensei Wilder knows his stuff and it shows in this DVD. He doesn't talk in it at all, but simply shows slow and fast versions of 121 goju techniques from the system's many kata.

This is a fine DVD for the goju stylist and other practitioners of traditional martial arts.

4260270,5,B004478YJY,"I'll keep this short.  I do not practice Goju Ryu karate, but I do practice a southern Chinese system and was able to find similar applications found in my forms.  If nothing else, this dvd sparked my imagination to go back again and look at my sets and take them apart bit by bit.  Worth the money just for that!",1288483200,,313,4.183333333333334
4260271,5,B004478YJY,"First off, this video is not fancy.  In fact, with its sometimes grainy shots, occasionally washed out lighting, techno-based soundtrack, and complete lack of dialogue or discussion, it seems purposefully designed to be reminiscent of an underground video that you might expect to find hidden away in a dusty attic along with a stash of super secret martial arts material or passed furtively from friend to friend with the admonition, ""Dude!  You've got to see this!""

And the admonition would be correct.  You do have to see this.  Why?  Because the content is, just as the title advertises, killer.  Once again, it is nothing fancy.  Just application, after application, after brutal application - first at full-speed and then in slow motion.  And even though no sequence from a solo kata is ever shown, the material is not hard to follow.  This is because of the video's structure.  The applications are presented one kata at a time, and even within each individual kata section, the applications are shown chronologically, starting at the beginning of the form and moving to the end.  It should be noted, though, the applications presented are not meant to be exhaustive.  Oftentimes, there will be several applications taken from the same sequence of a form, as variations on a theme, while other times, certain sequences from a kata will not have an application represented in the video at all.  However, this is purposeful.  The video is not designed to be a catalog or encyclopedia of techniques but rather as a springboard for the practitioner to use in diving deeper into his or her own study of the karate kata and their applications.

Clearly, this video is a must-own for any Goju-Ryu practitioner, as it is designed for a viewer that already has a knowledge of the Goju-Ryu kata.  However, I believe that the audience for this video is much larger.  To begin with, although forms are somewhat style-specific, the movements found within them often cross across forms and styles.  As a result, any karateka, regardless of style, is likely to be able to take applications from the video and find where they can be applied in his or her own kata.  Even beyond karate practitioners, though, this video might be of interest to kata nay-sayers of all stripes, as it is a quick and accessible presentation of exactly what the fuss is all about and why the traditional forms are considered so valuable.

Obviously, I recommend this video highly.  It's fast, fun, and full of useful information that can be applied by any karate practitioner who wants to better understand the kata in more than just a superficial manner.",1287878400,5,2625,4.891402714932127
4260272,5,B004478YJY,"Excellent demonstration of Goju-ryu kata bunkai (applications of solo forms) in an easy to watch and reference format.  These applications are easily generalizable to any karate student regardless of style.  These are useful techniques and tactics for beginner and advanced students alike.

4260273,5,B004478YJY,"This is really an excellent investment for anyone interested in Goju Ryu bunkai. Rather than detailed technical explanation that drones on, or complicated sequences you are bound to forget, this is straight up simple and effective applications one after another from Goju Ryu kata. Watching them as a whole, you can see the underlying principles at work.

Aside from the sheer quality of the material itself, it also makes a great companion piece to Kane and Wilder's The Way of Kata, you can see that methodology at work on this DvD. What's here is simple, effective, and adaptable.",1286409600,3,583,4.948979591836735

8415938,3,B004478YJY,"I thought it was useful. Expected more application on the higher rank kata though. However, not a bad dvd for the price.",1379894400,,120,4.5
8415939,2,B004478YJY,"First, I'd like to say that the martial artists seen in this video are very well respected and known globally for their spectacular books and insight into kata application. However, this video fell short of my expectations. The special effects I felt, practically drowned all chance for a professional approach, but this change in the feel of the conveyance can be overcome. Though it does distract and remove seriousness, I felt as if they were there to cover up for the quality of the tapes. The scrawled writing and retro look, combined with music makes it appear as though the sub par quality was intentional. Lighting at times, made it difficult to see anything, grainy shots everywhere, and shaking pictures were found everywhere in this video. With the footage and tape being the entire product here, I felt it should have at least been better quality. At the very least to have the same quality throughout rather than a display of various bad qualities. There are no auditory comments to help explain anything at all. Its up to the viewer to make sense of the techniques, so this is intended for advanced gojuryu practitioners only. However, the techniques displayed were all extremely basic. There is no advanced commentary or direction for advanced study. So, only advanced practitioners can understand it, but there's nothing advanced about it? I feel there is no great info in here that an advanced karateka wouldn't already know. There are some various viewpoints and applications presented, but even then I felt there were large pieces of the kata left out of their analysis. This is not an detailed study of kata application at all.
I fully support and look to Lawrence Kane and Kris Wilder as experts, but I was extremely disappointed by this product. In my opinion, it was a video thrown together to make some money with some very basic application and detailed special effects to make it look better. Please, buy every book you can get your hands on by these guys, especially if you're a gojuryu practitioner, but this is not one of their best products.",1328054400,2,2071,4.853107344632768
8415940,1,B004478YJY,"doesn't even rate one star...the only thing likely to be killed by these pseudo-bunkai is the credibility of goju ryu....probably my most disappointing spend in 2011. I had hoped for something at least congruent with Wilder's wonderfully informative ""Way of Kata"" in terms of exemplification of the principles of kata analysis/bunkai. Basically 121 responses to traditional oi/gyaku tsuki thrown by a ridiculously static and somnabulistically compliant partner.i survived 15 years working doors and backstage security...trust me... NONE OF THESE WOULD WORK IN A REAL FIGHT. No wonder boxers and MMA fighters hold traditional karate in contempt. GIVE THIS ONE A BIG SWERVE...",1317168000,2,674,5.617647058823529
8415941,3,B004478YJY,"This is a very fast shorthand version of a technique on DVD with zero fanfare or verbal explanation. 121 of them, one right after another with no stopping.

To glean anything, you have to really watch to figure out how the technique is being used.  I would NOT recommend this to a beginner.  The reason I say that is because you have the basic knowledge of the kata, the bunkai and alternative bunkai before you start thinking about going outside the box.  Thus I'd probably recommend it to brown belt or higher ONLY.

Most techiniques are good, some aren't, and a few I think leave you wide open for trouble. But in fairness ~ when learning any technique, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE if it'll work for you. Since not all practitioners can pull off the same technique, you do have to FIND ONES that work for you!

Before anyone thinks I'm slamming the guy ~ I am a fan of Kris and think I've every book he's written in my collection, which I praise highly.  The biggest issue is the filming style and presentation of the techniques combined with the flashy special effects that are pretty boring after the first 10 minutes. A couple of times the special effects even blur out the video at crucial moments making it difficult to see what is happening......oh, and the rave disco music in the background is real cheezy.

Again, since there is no verbage, any beginner will find little help here. As the review title suggests, this is good or okay ~ but not a homerun by any means.  I might share a technique or two with fellow doshi, but doubt I'll recommend anyone rush out and buy this unless they know what they are getting.",1316304000,3,1616,4.469387755102041
8415942,5,B004478YJY,"Arrived on time.  This is a great DVD, different than any other I've viewed on Kata applications.  It's a great companion to Mr. Wilder's ""The Way of Kata: A Comprehensive Guide for Deciphering Martial Applications""

8415943,2,B004478YJY,"I'm a fan of Kris Wilder, and have read several of his books. I thought his work to be insightful for Martial Artists, especially for those of us who practice Goju Ryu. 121 Killer appz. I think not. 121 elementary applications are more like it. I was not thoroughly impressed and found the applications to very basic. This DVD is not on par with his other fine works.",1313884800,,367,4.411764705882353
8415944,4,B004478YJY,"I think that this is an excellent Dvd, it touches on a subject neglected by many. I enjoyed the content and the no frills presentation. I even enjoyed the way in which it was filmed almost as if it was some old hiden film transfered over to modern times.

8415945,5,B004478YJY,"This is an unusual DVD in several respects. While many kata bunkai DVDs are long on kata and short on bunkai, this is the opposite: there are 121 bunkai and no kata. The viewer is expected to recognize the movements from the kata, which means this DVD is really made for the advanced Goju Ryu practitioner.
The production values are quite different to Wilder's previous work. 121 Killer Appz! is released by Aiki Productions and, perhaps in an effort to set it apart, it has been given an `underground' vibe. The hardcore graphics and garage music feel at odds with what is, despite the brutality of the techniques, still a traditional martial art. However, this is a minor concern considering the sheer wealth of techniques on display.
And that's where the real value of this DVD lies: 121 bunkai taken from the entire Goju syllabus - Gekisai, Saifa, Seiyunchin, Seipai, Shisochin, Sanseiru, Kururunfa, Seisan and Suparinpei. The pace is fast and furious. Each bunkai is presented once at full speed and once more in slow motion before moving on, with no verbal explanations. Don't blink or you'll be hitting the rewind button!
Essentially, this is a `download' of Sensei Wilder's bunkai filmed in a continuous sequence, and if you are a Goju practitioner it will make fascinating viewing. Even if you're not, you'll discover themes and concepts at work to inspire you in the exploration of your own kata. It's also worth noting that Sensei Wilder is ably assisted in his demonstrations by his long-time associate and co-author of several great books, Lawrence Kane.
