825372,4,6304263457,"Released in 1983, Valley Girl stars Nicolas Cage as a Hollywood dude named Randy who develops a relationship with a girl from the San Fernando Valley, Julie (Deborah Foreman). Their sub-cultural clash excites them but turns off some of their friends. Julies three friends are played by Elizabeth Daily (Loryn), Heidi Holicker (Stacey) and Michelle Meyrink (Suzi). Lee Purcell plays Suzis overheated stepmother while Cameron Dye plays Randys best friend and Michael Bowen Randys nemesis. Frederic Forrest and Colleen Camp are on hand as Julies parents.

I don't usually list so many cast members, but I make an exception here because the characters are so notable. Believe it or not, Colleen Camp (Julies mother) was the Indian playmate in 1979s Apocalypse Now.

The term valley girl is a socio-economic stereotype of a class of young women characterized by the colloquial dialect Valleyspeak and the corresponding vapid materialism. While it originally referred to the upper-middle class girls of the Los Angeles commuter towns of the San Fernando Valley in the early 80s, it later applied more broadly to any woman or girlprimarily in the USA and Canadatypified by ditziness, airheadedness, and greater interest in conspicuous consumption than spiritual or intellectual accomplishment.

The movie was quickly thrown together in response to Frank Zappas 1982 hit Valley Girl, notorious for 14 year-old Moon Zappas monologue, which popularized Valleyspeak like Gag me with a spoon. Whatever the case, the film works well for what it is, a coming-of-age drama about Southern Californian youths. Stacey and Loryn stand out, as far as the girls go, particularly during the quasi-slumber party sequence. The music, however, is disappointing, particularly the so-called rock played at the Hollywood nightclub. Its more akin to new wave pop than anything genuinely rock/metal, which is strange given that this was the era that gave birth to kick-axx Hollywood hair bands like Van Halen, Motley Crue, Dokken, Ratt, WASP and, shortly later, Guns n Roses, not to mention a gazillion more. Other early-to-mid 80s teen movies had the same problem, like Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink. If you want an excellent rockin soundtrack check out 1982s Fast Times at Ridgemont High and 1993s Dazed and Confused.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area with the mall scenes shot in Stockton.

825952,4,6304263457,"Like, this movie should have been called like ""Valley Boy,"" or maybe ""Valley Dude,"" instead.  'Cause like Nicolas Cage is in it, and like Nicolas Cage is like totally bitchin'.  Like the way that he combs his hair, and like the way that he shaves his chess hair in like a Y, and, you know, just how overall bitchin' cool he is.  Or at least like he was.

It really is too bad that Mr. Cage has done so many stinker films since this one.  I believe that he got into some tax trouble, and so, more than likely, he had to make garbage action films to pay for those taxes.  He did really redeem himself in ""Kick Ass"" though, playing Chloe Moretz's father, and I was very disappointed that he didn't make an appearance in the sequel.  Well, I guess it's hard to show up when your character's dead, although ""Melrose Place"" used to do it all of the time.  How many times did the dead Sydney character come back, as an example?  So why not do the same in ""Kick Ass 2""?  The writers could have at least written in some kind of dream sequence for him.

But Mr. Cage does make a real ""dreamy sequence"" here, even though I'm a guy, and even though I'm not gay.  Hey, he's very cool -- or he used to be -- so he should get his kudos.  Most of the rest of the characters are a little blas though, I will admit, and most of the acting is pretty wooden.  Well, maybe that's the way it should be, because perhaps teenagers, at least in the valley, and at least in the early 80s, were probably pretty stupid overall.

I watched this film shortly after it first released; I would have been in my late teens myself at the time.  But I watched it again today, in its original uncut 16 x 9 HD 1080i glory (up converted to 1080P).  I've written before how much I like to watch some of these older films again, in HD, since so many of them I watched originally on TV in 480i and letterboxed 4 x 3, which ruins the overall movie experience.  And this was on MGM I believe, so I had to record it.

Well, I wish that Mr. Cage would do more films nowadays that are good, and where he is good himself, just like ""Kick Ass.""  And thinking about it, man, he really rocked much earlier in ""Moonstruck"" with Cher.  Ah, that film was a thing of pure beauty.  Well, we can like totally hope.  It would be like righteously awesome if he ever did.",1407456000,,2311,4.143820224719101

826139,5,6304263457,"This movie is a cult classic for very good reason. The movie's backdrop shoots back and forth between the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, and in doing so offers some great social commentary on the difference between the two closely situated but culturally opposing Los Angeles cities. The acting is loose and authentic, offering both funny and dramatic moments. The soundtrack is pretty revolutionary in the sense not many movies then had incorporated an actual rock soundtrack that runs throughout the movie. The dialogue is also excellent; as it offers up a lot of the Valley lingo during that time.",1390608000,2,604,5.05

826223,5,6304263457,"Once upon a time, Nicolas Cage was a very good actor...no really! Now if you have trouble believing this (and who wouldn't...this is the guy who brought us ""Knowing"" and the worst affected ""accent"" ever in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"") then you must watch the eighties gem ""Valley Girl"" and see Cage as Randy, the hip and hot Hollywood New Waver who falls in love with totally fer sure bitchin' chick Julie from the Val.  It's a Reagan era ""Romeo and Juliet"" with one of the best soundtracks ever, featuring on screen performances by Josie Cotton (""Johnny are you Queer?"") and The Plimsouls (""A Million Miles Away""), and additional music by Modern English, Men at Work and The Psychedelich Furs, among others.

Martha Coolidge directed ""Valley Girl"", a brilliant beginning for what would become a prolific but marginal directing career (""Real Genius"", ""The Prince and Me"").  The original concept for the film came from the truly awful affected manner that eighties girls everywhere copied from Frank Zappa's great single ""Valley Girl"" (""Okay fine, fer sure fer sure, she's a Valley Girl and there is no cure..."").  Having been barely twenty when the movie debuted, I am all too sorry to say that I can personally attest to the truth of the obnoxious-ness of this fad.

I loved ""Valley Girl"" from the first time I saw it.  Nicolas Cage has never been better, and Deborah Foreman (Julie) gives an amazingly touching and realistic portrayal of a young woman in love, torn between the world where she is at home and that of her dashing (and definitely pre-capped teeth) dark lover.  The movie has actually gotten better with age, and stands out as one of the best of the eighties films of its kind.  Gnarly to the max, fer sure.",1373414400,7,1719,4.74496644295302

The commentary and interviews with the director, stars and even musicians(!) are priceless.

Director Martha Coolidge just keeps going on about how she had no budget and couldn't waste even a few frames of film.  Instead being tiresome this gives you a very genuine sense of the challenges that go into directing a budget constrained movie and how they can be overcome.

The musician interviews are also pretty striking, where did they find these people after all these years and why are they bothering to discuss this movie?  Well it doesn't matter, it just works and it's really nice to hear how the movie impacted their careers.  One glaring omission is Bonnie Hayes who isn't even mentioned, although her songs totally rock and are featured prominently.  One can only assume she was not available, but it would have been nice for them to at least talk about her contributions.  Ironically they did such a great job with the other interviews it raises your expectations and it's like, ""hey where's Bonnie?""

The actor interviews are also insightful and even though I sort of wanted to dislike Nicholas Cage I think he did a fine job.  He conveys a lot of respect for the movie and the director and seems quite sincere.  Well done!

Anyway, while the movie alone is worth the price of the DVD, the extras definitely seal the deal since you probably won't get those elsewhere.  Why does Randy's chest hair look so strange in the beach scene?  Well apparently Martha asked him to remove some of it off to appear look more like high school boy (although he was just 17).  You'll have to hear Mr. Cage explain the rest!",1357344000,2,1673,4.662116040955631

From the scene in the bar with ""A Million Miles Away"" playing, I swear my heart skip a few beats in the perfectness of that scene, to the passing of time as ""I'll Melt With You"" forever echos in my head as I dream about that 80s bad boy and a simpler time.

The plot is lacking a little but it's none the less a great movie. Only real down side I see is the ending. I thought it was pretty silly the first time through. But after a few more times, while it still is, I laugh because it's also kind of sweet.

826576,5,6304263457,"since my teenage years were spent during the 80's, this film is near and dear to me psychologically (just like the John Hughes' films of the 80's).

this story if sort of a romeo and juliet romance set in the early 80's.  Julie is a upper middle class preppy and Randy is a hard-living punk of the streets.  It is the classic story of forbidden romance, updated for the 80's.  Simple formula:  boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to win back the girl.

The film features a young Nicolas Cage, before he became a super-star.  Deborah Foreman plays Julie.  All the other actors are excellent.  In fact, the cast and chemistry between the actors is what makes this such a special film that has stood the test of time.  This film is NOT just an adolescent teen movie about dating.  It is much deeper than that.  Very adult themes of friendship, love, loss, betrayal, conflict, & alcohol abuse are presented.

The film strikes a great balance between drama and comedy.  There are funny moments in the film, but the dramatic pieces are very ""real"" and touching, for anyone who has ever fallen in love with someone and has experienced a break-up.

Also worth noting is the excellent soundtrack.  The songs fit perfectly with the script; in fact, some scenes were filmed inside a bar with the actual band ""The Plimsouls"" performing their music.

The great script, actors, and music makes this a treasure of the past that you must own; especially if you are a Gen-Xer like myself.

The supporting characters are superb, and the story has heart. There's a great lesson to be learned here about following your heart vs. following what's expected of you. Applause! Applause!

826578,4,6304263457,"This movie really doesn't make any sense. Nothing that happens in it really should happen, least of all the attraction between the cute-as-a-button titular character and the pug-ugly who intrudes on her well-ordered life. None of the main characters, from Valley Girl Julie (Deborah Foreman) to Hollywood lowlife Randy (Nicholas Cage), has a real clue about anything that's going on, but that doesn't stop them from blundering along into and eventually over obstacles that largely exist only their own culturally prejudiced minds.

One obstacle, Julie's Valley boyfriend Tommy (ex-boyfriend if you buy early developments), has a serious territoriality problem, but for the most he's almost beside the point. He's merely Randy's mirror image, no more flawed than his rival except in being smug instead of disarming. Far more daunting are Julie's friends, a gaggle of giddy girls who apply the peer pressure like nobody's business, and seem incapable of learning from experience. The one friend who knows too well what Tommy's about makes only the vaguest swipes at warning Julie about him, and ultimately gives up to no purpose.

There aren't many anchors attached to the proceedings, least of all the few adults in the vicinity. Julie's father still deeply feels the passing of his era (the late 1960s), while her mother could just as well be her big sister. There is, however, a wonderful sense of affection among them, and the parents do have a genuine grasp of what a generation gap is all about. They would be the very last people to have a problem with their daughter going with a guy like Randy, so long as he was what she really wanted.

What puts this film over is the sense in the narrative that life really isn't about things that should happen, that the choices it places before us are never fair, and that we're almost never equipped, at any time of life, to deal with them when they arise. The script gives you the impression that it's wrapped things up at the end, but if so it's only in terms of momentary events. The movie leaves the real choices that have to be made, and not just by Randy and Julie, for that hazy future that lies beyond the closing shot.",1288569600,2,2173,4.789333333333333

826580,5,6304263457,"The studio bean counters were probably chomping at the bit when they were pitched this film whose title was spun-off from Moon Zappa's novelty hit song.  They were rewarded with a film of great poignance and intelligence about a love story between two kids from opposite sides of the tracks.  Director Martha Coolidge delivers a film that is very knowing about class envy and peer pressure and how it effects relationships.  What I liked about this film is it shows the vulnerability of the teen years and not as all-knowing adults.  Nicolas Cage and Deborah Foreman project dynamism and your heart breaks when their love hits a bump in the road.  Two scenes stand out as smart homages to other films.  One where Cage and Foreman are nuzzling under the marquee of a movie theatre where ""Romeo and Juliet"" is playing and at the end where the two escape from the prom and sit safely in the back seat of a stretch limo which recalls ""The Graduate"".  My only reservation here is some gratuitous nudity which seemed to be a staple in films at that time.",1264032000,2,1048,4.602150537634409

I have watched this movie numerous times- it's sort of my HAPPY PLACE! And Nicolas Cage is absolutely gorgeous in it!

  This movie captures the lighthearted teen scene in the 80's... things that are considered ""taboo"" now in teen movies (a.k.a doing drugs in the bathroom, or a teen girl's mom trying to hook up with the boy her daughter has a crush on) are perfectly normal and acceptable in this movie- which makes it so great! It's a good love story as well as a trip back in time! It also has the BEST techno-rock soundtrack; I would recommend that as well.

  If not for any other reason, watch this movie for the totally 80's fashions.. Very entertaining!!  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves the 1980's as much as I do. Trippin -Dicular!!",1231718400,3,1066,4.326633165829146
826674,5,6304263457,"Julie's cool, Randy's hot. She's from the Valley, he's like so not! Nicolas Cage(Randy) and Deborah Foreman(Julie Richman) star in this ""sweet, fast, unpretentious & funny"" romantic comedy drama that mixes preppies, punkers and a ""hit-filled soundtrack"" including The Plimsouls and Modern English into an iconic cult film that's ""entertaining"" to the max! Julie is, like, so over her preppy boyfriend, she dumps him on the escalator at the Galleria & when she meets punker Randy, her eyes practically bug out because she thinks he's sexy even though he makes her friends gag, but even if Randy's ready to stop the world and melt with her, can Julie risk her losing her friends and her super-popularity at school just to be with him?

VALLEY GIRL was released in the Spring of 1983 was loosely based on Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet about a foxy high school teenage valley girl Julie who seems to have it all such as good looks, popularity, and a handsome valley dude & sleazy boyfriend Tommy(Michael Bowen)whom Julie breaks up with since she gets fed up with Tommy's arrogance & lack of respect towards her, but then ends up meeting her new love interest Randy at the beach & ends up getting acquainted with him at a party he & his Hollywood punk buddy Fred Bailey(Cameron Dye)end up crashing at Julie's friend Suzi's house one night.

Julie's blossoming romance with Randy disgusts her friends, simply because Randy isn't from the valley like they are, so they threaten Julie with the loss of her popularity & their friendship unless she dumps Randy, so Julie goes to her era hippie father Steve Richman(Fredric Forest)for advice who tells her to just follow her heart & then Julie ends up caving into peer pressure by tearfully breaking up with Randy & reluctantly reconciling with Tommy, but then Randy ends up winning Julie back after a brief scuffle with Tommy.

The subplot involves Suzi Brent(Michelle Meyrink)and her stepmother Beth Brent(Lee Purcell)prying for attention of their grocery delivery boy Skip(David Ensor), but Skip finds himself attracted to Beth & goes out of his way to see her without Suzi finding out & even even turns down Suzi's invitation to go to her house during an unsupervised slumber party since Beth is out on a date, but then 1 day Skip enters Suzi's house apparently looking for Beth, but ends up finding Suzi in Beth's bathroom showering in full frontal nudity and then Skip and Suzi end up making love & Beth comes home walking into her bedroom catching Skip & Suzi in bed together.

In fact, I just suddenly noticed that Michelle Meyrink(Suzi)is also the gal who played Gilbert's nerdy girlfriend(Judy)in the movie REVENGE OF THE NERDS with Robert Caradine(Lewis), Anthony Edwards(Gilbert), and Julie Montgomery(Betty Chiles).

VALLEY GIRL also had numerous popular hit songs from the 1980's in it too like ""I Melt With You"" by Modern English; ""Electric Avenue"" by Eddie Grant; ""Don't Put Another Dime In The Jukebox"" by The Flirts, ""Who Can It Be Now"" by Men-At-Work; ""Girls Like Me"" by Bonnie Hayes, etc; along with the fact that this movie had launched Nicholas Cage's acting career and made him a star.

This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time, which was another reason why I used to get so fascinated watching various scenes of this movie that took place in the L.A.

""Awesome"" is one obvious example, and it is difficult to imagine teenagers today conversing without the use of ""Like,"" where it is not used to connote ""similarity."" At the time of its release, these were rather novel. This film does have a good soundtrack and it is a pretty decent love story of a popular, middle class girl, who falls for a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. In the title role, Deborah Foreman is quite irresistible. Nicolas Cage is fine as the rough-hewn Randy, though he is never very believable as the favorite son of his tough neighborhood. It is embarrassing to the point of laughter as he interacts with his homeboys during a cruise through his neighborhood. Another aspect that does not ring true is some of the dialogue. A prime example of this is the conversation among Randy, Julie, Tommy and Stacie at the club in Hollywood, where they sit down and immediately begin discussing their statuses and degrees of authenticity. Not only is it not convincing in its content, the transition to it is non-existent. Gripes aside, this is not a bad film. However, I would not go so far as to say it is great either. As a comedy, it isn't very funny. As a romance, their love seems to be based on physical attributes rather than commonalities and, as such, not very compelling. Nonetheless, Elizabeth Daily is always a delight, and her role here makes this a must for fans.

This type of girl usually dressed in preppy colorful clothes, had their own slang terms, cared about their social status, and were always seen at the Galleria.  In 1983 Valley Girl, the movie was released, and became a cult status film, depicting the Valley Girl lifestyle. The movie stars Deborah Foreman, as Julie Richman, a valley girl , and Nicolas Cage as Randy, a young punk from Hollywood. After dumping her val boyfriend, Julie attends one of her friends parties and ends up meeting Randy, even though they are from 2 different worlds, these two show that opposites do attract and instantly become an item. Julies parents parents are cool with their relationship, her friends aren't, and pressure Julie into dumping him, so she can get back with her Ex, leaving Julie to decide who she should choose, her popularity or true love.

It makes me laugh that people are so smug to think that the ""present"" is perfect. Well, I have news for you. The present is far from perfect and there's a whole lot about the past that was MUCH better than it is today. The movie ""Valley Girl"" is a wonderful example of how COOL the early 80's were!

I won't offer a review of the film itself, because that's already been done by much better reviewers than myself. I will simply say that this is a great youth movie from a very positive time in America. It's always great to be young... but it was TOTALLY AWESOME to be young in the early 80's!

The DVD features a great transfer with a few nifty ""extras"" (80's trivia track and audio commentary by director Martha Coolidge). As noted by a few other reviewers, a few of the songs have been removed from the film (and this is not noted anywhere on the DVD package). Also, for some reason the sound was remixed and some of the music has been placed in the ""background"" when it was originally quite loud and ""up front"". Since the music is such an integral part of this film it's a shame that it has been altered in any way.

Remember:

If you should ever find yourself making fun of 80's fashions or haircuts just put Valley Girl in your DVD player so that you can be reminded of how FUN and COOL that time really was. Those who truly understand what the 80's were all about make no apologies and have no regrets. The 80's were a TOTAL blast, and Valley Girl is a wonderful testament to that fact!

Unlike The Last American Virgin, however, this film has an awful sountrack, and it didn't really end in a notable way.

From a filmmaking standpoint, this seems amateurish. Apparently this is where director Martha Coolidge cut her teeth, because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film, Real Genius, just two years later.

The big problem with this film is shallowness. We never learn much about any of the characters, so it's not easy to care about them. I still can't figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other, since the only way they ever describe each other is ""hot"". They never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other. There's no depth to the relationship at all.

Another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about 18-22 years old, while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under 30 years old herself. A whole subplot that revolves around the mother (Beth, played by Lee Purcell) is unsatisfactorily resolved about half-way throught the film, then never mentioned again. Even so, I like her temptations a lot more than Stifler's Mom in American Pie!

Lisa Foreman's lead character, Julie, behaves less like a ""Valley Girl"" of the 1980's than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in Overland Park, Kansas. If you're familiar with Moon Unit Zappa's song, ""Valley Girl"", you'll find almost none of that kind of language in this film. Nicolaus Cage's character, Randy, is likeable enough, but he looks more like a member of Jefferson Starship than a ""punk"" (his almost mullet-like hair is blown upward on top--that's it!). Unfortunately, for an ""odd couple"" story like this to work, you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters. But these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood. They don't seem at all from the other side of the tracks.

The obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song, ""I'll Melt With You"". A montage is meant to compress time, and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose. They should have faded it out after 45-60 seconds for more effect.

The most entertaining characters in the film, by far, are Julie's parents--a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for Berke Lander's parents in the hilarious 2001 teen film, ""Get Over It"".

The soundtrack, too, is terribly inferior to The Last American Virgin, and doesn't represent the early 1980's well at all. Only the aforementioned ""I'll Melt With You"" stands out as a great song. Meanwhile, a tune that repeats the question ""Johnny Are You Queer?"" seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom.

From a nostalgia standpoint, I didn't feel like I was watching an 80's movie at all. In fact, the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table (even though the characters didn't smoke), which reminded me for the first time in years that California was once part of a free country, and wasn't always ruled by neurotics. Frankly, I was surprised that the Orwellian thought-police hadn't airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film. Today, every surface in California is littered with a fear-mongering Proposition 65 warning stickers instead. I'm so grateful I was a teenager in the 1980's, rather than today!

Overall, this film fails on too many counts to recommend it, but I wouldn't blame you for checking it out. It's good enough fun for 99 minutes. The Special Edition DVD adds quite a few features that make the DVD worthwhile, if you can get it cheap!",1143590400,7,3900,4.826347305389222
826877,5,6304263457,"Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman star in this great movie from the 80's about a girl from the Valley and a guy from Hollywood.  Foreman stars as Julie, a valley girl who, along with her boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen) are the most popular couple at Valley High.  However, Julie is getting bored with Tommy because she thinks he's ignoring her.  So, she breaks up with him (on a mall escalator, no less).  After the break-up, Julie and her friends Samantha (Tina Theberge), Loryn (Elizabeth Daily), and Suzie (Michelle Meyrink) head to the beach.  It is here that Julie gets her first glimpse of Randy (Cage).

Unfortunately for Julie, she and her now ex-boyfriend Tommy are both supposed to go to a party at Suzie's house.  Randy's friend Fred overhears the plans for the party, and he and Randy plan to crash the party.  Sure enough, Fred and Randy show up uninvited at Suzie's house, but Julie is immediately intrigued by Randy.  The two start talking, but Tommy and his thug friends interfere and throw Randy out of the house.  Now very mad, Randy and Fred go back to the party.  Randy waits in the bathroom for Julie to come in, and the two decide to leave together.  Julie convinces Samantha to come along.

Randy takes Julie ""over the hill' to Hollywood and shows her some of his favorite places to hang out.  The sparks soon begin to fly between Randy and Julie, and they start going steady, much to the disgust of Julie's friends.  Their relationship goes along very well for a while, but one night at a sleepover, Julie's friends tell her that she must make a choice between them and Randy.  They convince her to get back together with Tommy and dump Randy.  Julie goes along with it, and starts to be very mean to Randy, but does she really feel that way, or is she just covering up her true feelings for the sake of her friends?  Will Julie and Randy get back together, or will Julie do what her friends want her to?

This is a great movie.  I've seen it several times on VHS, and I was thrilled to find it on DVD. Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman are great in their roles as Julie and Randy.  The supporting actors are very good as well.  This movie was released when I was in high school, so it brings back a lot of memories for me.  The great 80s music played throughout the movie is a huge plus, too.

I give this movie my highest recommendation. The story is excellent, and the acting is very good.  Take a trip back to the 80s with this great movie.  ""Its awesome"".",1143072000,3,2484,4.428256070640177

826881,4,6304263457,"""Valley Girl"" is a gem of a movie. While the dialogue is stilted and the acting is pretty questionable (except for young Nicolas Cage), one cannot help but smile at the film's utter embodiment of everything early 1980's, including clothes and catch-phrases. The plot is a familiar one: two kids from different social groups fall in love and noone wants them to be together (ala ""Pretty in Pink"").

Nicolas Cage is good as Randy, a loud but sweet punk rocker who falls for the girl from the Valley, Julie. His is the best performance in the movie by far.

The movie is almost worth watching for the soundtrack alone. The soundtrack features Modern English, The Plimsouls, and Josie Cotton. Josie Cotton is the singer at the prom in the movie, too.

For those who grew up in the 80's, or are just fans of the decade, this movie is a must-see. And, hey, any movie that has a food fight at the prom can't be all bad.",1118966400,4,912,4.449101796407185

I'd previously only seen this movie on an ex-rental VHS tape, circa early 1980s, because ""Valley Girl"" appears never to have been re-issued on VHS in Australia. As well as being an obvious improvement on the VHS version in technical terms, the DVD has the added attraction of Martha Coolidge's audio commentary.

  Her commentary on this DVD is considerably superior to that of Amy Heckerling and Cameron Crowe on the DVD of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", which I found overly casual and less informative (sorry Amy, I still love your films). Although I'd seen ""Valley Girl"" many times, Coolidge's commentary gave me a lot more insight into the film. She communicates at a level that the general public can understand, but doesn't neglect to discuss technical and business factors that importantly influenced the end product. Coolidge's commentary on ""Valley Girl"" is collected, engaging, detailed and very informative. The insight she provides into matters such as the work put into the film's colour scheme, the organisation of the brilliant party scene and the way budgetary constraints determined some aspects of the film is exemplary. Although this film is without doubt an icon of 1980s popular culture, it's also a remarkable accomplishment in filmmaking more generally: a movie that derives its premise from exploitation film but emerges as a more appealing and ideologically sound piece of youth entertainment than anyone expected of teen movies in that era.",1101513600,13,1643,5.169172932330827

The disc has no label and there are no leaflets or other material that you'd expect with a DVD entitled SPECIAL EDITION. I thought that would at least warrant a disc label. Pathetic for a major league film studio. Makes me wonder if they're going to replace the MGM lion with a hand puppet.

NEway, the film quality is clear and sharp, the sound OK and the songs are great to hear again. The disco bathroom makeout scene blows the doors off Enrique's Escape Video for sheer steaminess. How is it that low budget indie movies always look that much more credible?

Nicolas Cage shows his future promise in this early role, and the climactic fight scene, where he whips Julie's boyfriend, hijacks their prom limo and then takes her to the hotel room the boyfriend had reserved is still one of my favorite movie scenes.

Its not even romantic. Its not funny. Not even her Hippi-parents. Its just shallow. Might

be useful if you are a teacher to show it in class. It is interesting as a 80s study and shows your children how innocent they ought to be.

His movies since this film seem to have taken some of the qualities that Randy possessed & use them over again.  In particular, City of Angels when Cage's character has just turned ""human"" and is skipping in the street, singing.  It reminds me of the scene in Valley Girl where Randy has just been rejected by Julie & is seen leaving her house, shouting ""Like F... Y... totally"".

So, this film was a wonderful piece of escapism for our emotional teenage girl minds!! The film is, like another reviewer said, a classic Romeo and Juliet plot. West Side Story even? But, it's Preppies versus New Wave/Punk. As a story line, perhaps it's not as slick and polished as a John Hughes film but the rawness - that's what makes this film honest! I still watch this movie and get caught up in the main characters' romance and angst - it all rings true, even today. I watch the teenagers are the screen - the way they're dressed, how they act, the music - and I remember - that's how my friends and I lived! Oh, and the music. How can you not like a movie whose soundtrack includes The Plimsouls? And not to mention, this was the first time I ever heard, Modern English sing I'll Melt with You. Not to mention, Pat Travers! The soundtrack itself is reason enough to buy this movie.

 If the film is rough around the edges at times, it just adds to the nostalgia. I think this was one of Nicholas Cage's first roles and it just reminds me how far we've all come from those early 80s days.

 Compared to any John Hughes movie, I would say this was one of ""THE 80s"" movies. Checkout ""Say Anything"", too, if you like 80s films.",1091491200,6,1485,4.236749116607774

If your kid watches this movie, they'll be scarred for life. I recommend this one for desperate men that dig Internet teen-porn. Cage is sort-of-Elvis like as a bad-boy punk. He meets non-grody to the max Deb Foreman and a good girl-bad boy crush begins. The beach scene has bikinis and young bods, but then the camera shows teenager Cage in swim trunks.

Notice that all actors shave their chest these days, but I guess body hair was in in 83. Thank goodness for director John Hughes.

Then, the day after my birthday last summer, it came out on dvd.  It seemed like perfect timing..I thought for sure I'd get it as a gift. I didn't.  I did get a late Christmas present from my husband a few days ago, and this was it.
It is the most romantic gift he gave me next to the sparkly diamond stud earrings.  I think this movie belongs in the class.
Why? Well, first off, I am 34 yrs old, which make this movie one of many of my generation.  It brings me back to those glory days of 1980's high school.
""Valley Girl"" is a romantic comedy/drama, that has so much heart and such a clear and simple message of it's what inside that counts.  Frederick Forrest, who plays the father to Julie, who is played by Deborah Foreman, and is Valley Girl extradionare, delivers some of the best lines of the movie in the scene where he talks to her about what really matters in life.
This is a very 80's version of Romeo & Juliet instead it's Randy & Julie.  Randy, who is played by a very young Nicholas Cage, is the punker dude type that Julie falls in love with.  Their's is a typical teenage romance with phony friends and a jilted ex boyfriend trying to tear it all to pieces.
""Valley Girl"" has a bittersweet quality to it. I always cry when I watch it, and my heart swells up like a balloon.  It sounds corny, but it's true.  I still adore it after all these years.
The dvd had some good extras, I'm still checking some out, can't comment on all of them. One really good bit of trivia I learned is that Michael Bowen, who played Tommy, the Valley dude boyfriend of Julie, has appeared in a few Quention Tarentino films. It seems QT is a fan of this small, indy film..Gee, I wonder why?  It's totally cool to know that now.  I am only sad that Deb Foreman is not among the stars that came back after 20 years to be interviewed for this special edition disc.
I highly recommend this to fans of 80's films, or even just films about the 80's, or fans of love stories...Oh to heck with it, all movie fans will find something to appreciate in the movie ""Valley Girl"". My husband did.

He falls for the lovely, adorable & innocent Julie (Deborah Foreman, who, if any of you grew up in the '80's & stole your older sister's teen mags, you remember her in the Shine-Free ads for Maybelline). Deborah Foreman proves that some models (yes...gasp...it's true) can actually act extremely well in movies.

The film is very gutsy. It's stars mainly a bunch of unknowns & they all do a great job & it was shot in a mere 22 days (the budget was so low that director Martha Coolidge had the cast provide their own wardrobes).

A lot of people call the film a modern-day version of Romeo & Juliet & a lot of people have asked if the R in Randy & J in Julie was intentional as well as Randy & Julie standing under a sign of a movie theater that reads Romeo and Juliet. On the DVD commentary, Coolidge answers yes.

Julie's parents are the most unique & hysterical ones you'll find in this genre. One of my favorite parts is when the father is so nervous about his daughter going to her prom that he ducks into the bathroom to smoke a funny cigarette. ""Steve, where are you?! his wife asks. ""I'll be right there!"" he calls from the bathroom. ""I'm looking for the camera!"" Another great moment is when Julie comes home in the morning from going out with Randy & the parents kindheartedly advise her to protect herself  & she freaks out. ""Just 'cause we were out all night doesn't mean I did anything!""

Yeah, the plot isn't very original: The boy from the wrong tracks falls in love with the popular girl & her friends give her crap, but the film is so much fun, it doesn't really matter.

The film has a certain kind of innocence that we don't see in today's teen flicks. Julie & Randy just have fun being with each other, walking hand in hand, and talking and laughing. The topic of sex never comes up in the film between the two of them (or if it does, they're in no hurry). It's only brought up by one of Julie's best friends & Julie replies ""It hasn't gotten that far yet."" Any time she's about to go inside after one of their dates, they continue talking & laughing & kissing & then she closes the door & then, suddenly, opens it again it the whole
process begins again. Ah, makes me miss those times when I was a teenager in love.

The DVD features are excellent. The woman that played Suzie's stepmom hasn't aged a bit. How sickening! It must be nice to be her. Elizabeth Daily (Lauren) has gotten so much plastic surgery, she's hardly recognizable. I thought she was fine the way she was. I'll stop there. I don't want to spoil the DVD for ya.

I've never really cared for in the film's open ending. What's gonna happen with Julie & her friends? Is Tommy going to keep giving her hell? I also think both of the soundtracks could've been better. While they have a lot of great songs on them, poppy songs from The Flirts and, especially, Josie Cotten just grate on my nerves. Inspite of this, who could forget the film's theme song by Modern English ""I Melt with You"" that'll leave you humming the tune & feeling like you're on cloud nine long after the film's over.",1069113600,13,3246,4.327302631578948

Julie (Deborah Foreman) is the ultimate Val Girl who breaks up with her boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen).  While at the beach with her friends, she spots a cute guy, Randy (Nicolas Cage), a punk from Hollywood who crashes her friend's party.  Randy and Julie talk and seeing this Tommy gets jealous. Randy and Tommy get into a fight and Randy is tossed out.  He sneaks back in through the bathroom window and hides in the shower until Julie comes in.  He asks to leave the party and then takes her to Hollywood and his world.  The two fall in love, but Julie is pressured by her friends to break up with Randy and get back with Tommy as Randy doesn't fit into their world.  Julie gives in to her friends and breaks up with Randy.  Finally at the Valley High Junior Prom, Randy again crashes the proceedings, beats up Tommy and takes Julie back.  The film was shot on a shoestring budget by a then unknown director Martha Coolidge and featured a virtually unknown cast including Mr. Cage who of course went on to superstardom and an Academy Award.  The rest of the cast is enjoyable including Ms. Foreman who is the quintessential So Cal teenager of the early 80's, Heidi Holicker, Elizabeth Daily & Michelle Meyrick are fun as her Val Gal best friends, Cameron Dye is steady as Randy's sidekick Fred, Lee Purcell is lusty as a Mrs. Robinsonesque mother and Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest are great as Julie's hippie parents.  Another major component of the film was its soundtrack that drives the film.  Featuring new wave artists like The Plimsouls ""A Million Miles Away"", Josie Cotton's ""Johnny Are You Queer?"" and most importantly Modern English's ""I Melt With You"", it gave the film an anthmatic quality.  Valley Girl is perfect snapshot of an era from which was spawned.",1061856000,2,1868,4.658536585365853

Those who know the film will agree, this thoroughly entertaining ""Romeo and Julie"" story is fun from beginning to end and will transport you to a beautiful,1980's pink and aqua world of mallrats, hollywood punkers and mean ... jocks. Just a couple of complaints though. During the scene where Randy waits for Julie in the shower stall during the party, what happened to Men At Work's ""Who Can it Be Now?"" Also very glaringly absent from the DVD's 20 year look back on the film is Deborah Foreman. ...",1060992000,5,623,4.426086956521739

The interviews are great though it is interesting, almost comical, that Deborah Foreman couldn't take time out of her ""busy schedule"" to contribute to the DVD.  Seems like if you only do one film in your career that anyone remembers you for (apologies to ""My Chauffeur"" fans) you would leap at the chance to discuss the movie with anyone that will listen.  Cage is a great sport to contribute and he contributes a lot, as he genuinely has become a movie star and all that connotes. The option to watch the film with 80s trivia poping up on the screen is fun.  All in all those who liked the movie will not be disappointed and should enjoy the DVD.  The only let down is Foreman's failure to contribute.",1060387200,6,850,4.423076923076923
827086,5,6304263457,"This meaningful romantic comedy is finally back on dvd with special features this time around. This modern day Romeo & Juliet type of love story with a happier outcome is set to great music. It's an intelligent emotional romantic drama with comedy thrown in throughout it. Some of the funny lines & actions ad-libbed. Many unknowns at the time were cast with the most well known being Nicolas Cage who is showcased in the extra features. It is great to see Nicolas Cage before with a full head of his own real hair at 18 with his own real teeth before he had them capped. Unfortunately, the valley girl of the movie: actress Deborah Foreman is very ABSENT from the Extra Features to great disappointment as the rest of the main cast is all there. All the extra features leave out the valley girl of the movie. There is NO Deborah Foreman in any of the extra features on this dvd after watching all the extras in intense detail:an Interview with director Martha Coolidge and Nicolas Cage just mention her,the pop-up 1980's trivias simply state she was a Maybelline Makeup Model,the director commentary track says more of the making of-filming of the movie rather than the small personal details about the cast's behavior or other interesting tidbits we would never know unless the director told us & she didn'.Deborah Foreman was absent from all the featurettes and even the front cover of the dvd. Anyone know why the lead actress was left out of all the extra features of this 20th anniversay special edition ? The charmingly pretty actress Deborah Foreman co-starred with Emilio Estevez & Martin Sheen in ""In the Custody of Strangers"",co-starred with Val Kilmer in ""Real Genius"",co-starred with John Travolta,Kelly Preston & Ayre Gross in 1989's ""The Experts"" & Ted Raimi in 1990's ""Lunatics: a Love Story"" so where is she now ? Recent pictures online show her to look good at 38 in 2003. Nicolas Cage ( Face/Off,The Family Man ) and Deborah Foreman ( My Chaffeur, Real Genius,The Experts ) are the teens in love. One is from the valley and one is from Hollywood. Frederic Forrest ( ""Whatever"" movie ),Colleen Camp ( ""Sliver"" ) as Foreman's parents. Michael Bowen ( Jackie Brown,Echo Park )as the valley girl's ex-boyfriend. An assortment of actresses( Michelle Meyrink also of ""Real Genuis"" is one, Elizabeth Daily of ""No Small Affair"" is another )as her friends who exert peer pressure on her to be with the boyfriend who is socially correct ( a valley dude ) yet makes her unhappy. Lee Purcell ( Eddie Macon's Run ) as the young stepmom who tries to entice her stepdaughter's to-be-boyfriend as a spin on ""The Graduate"" still looks the same after 20 years in the reunion interview. A wonderful movie loaded with extras. The romance is beautiful. The comedy is funny. The drama is heart-breaking. The acting is excellent. The extras are great except for the lack of Deborah Foreman being involved or any update on her now-a-days. The widescreen clear picture shows things you would never notice before. Just don't be disappointed if you are a Deborah Foreman fan as there is no extra footage of her. The movie is in it's second release on dvd. Perhaps next time we will get the 2nd takes ( outtakes ) & the interview with the main star other than Nicholas Cage who is readily available in this special edition. If you want to re-live or get to know the 1980's romantic comedy- this is your meaningful movie. This started the California Surfer talk ""Radical"",etc. along with sporting great songs like ""That's the oldest story in the world"" & ""A Million Miles away"" by The Plimsouls as one of it's love themes- the other being ""I Melt with you"" by Modern English. The way the teenagers talk in 1982 when this movie was filmed is certainly modern english that is a million miles away from nowadays way of talking. Nicolas Cage & Deborah Foreman have LOTS of GREAT KISSING SCENES which look even better on dvd. This is a wonderfully dramatic romance with just enough comedy set in the trendy early 1980's California that Hollywood can be proud of. This may remind you of your first love. It may just show you what being in love can be. Valley Girl is a movie of quality that is best seen ready to laugh and cry.

This movie is as much 80's as Easy Rider was 60's. It defined the times is what it did.
As silly as it sounds, Valley Girl is actually a very good film. It's put together extremely well, and is original, fresh, and personal all at the same time! They simply do not make teen films of this calibre anymore.
This DVD release is long overdue, but well worth the wait! There are a score of fabulous extras, a commentary track with the director, conversations between the director and Nicolas Cage today, two music videos and much much more!
The picture is high-quality with a tad bit of grain, but the sound is 5.1 surround, and is in widescreen. Valley Girl has never looked or sounded better.

It seemed like they both had chemistry working closely together as the two main stars of this movie.  Deborah Forman unleashed the beginning of a new fashion and language era that could be seen and heard for almost the entire 80's era.  Of course anyone that grew up in the 80's won't ignore the fact that the soundtrack for the movie is unforgetable as well.  I say this is one of my favorite movie of it's time.,1055980800,3,547,4.44

There are many great 80's movies out there...Fast Times, Sixteen Candles and the Last American Virgian.  But this is the ultimate 80's movie.  If you put this movie in a time capsule and opened it 50 years from now (keep in mind this movie is already 20 years old) anyone who watched it would not have one question about what it was like to be a teenager in the 80's.

I have a copy on VHS and I am afraid to watch it because I may never get the movie again.  Nicolas Cage was at his best and I was in love with Deborah Foreman and that smile of hers.

I remember sitting in those same seats in the food court as they did in the movie. When I saw Vally Girl for the first time I was surprised to see a scene from a place I always hung out at. Also the scene where they are going down the escalator, that leads out to the parking garage! This is and always will be an awsome movie! GET IT ON DVD FAST!!!!!!!!",1043712000,,645,3.785185185185185

I was only in Jr. high when this movie came out, and I remember wondering why there was a different girl on the poster that who was actually in the movie after I saw it. I remember reading about it in a magazine, but I'm sorry to say I don't know the exact cicumstances, but the movie was recast at some point, and they had all these posters and album covers made already, and I guess, didn't want to redo them. I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. But if not, feel free to email me and enlighten me. This is one of my favorite 80's movies too. I also read somewhere that the mall scenes were filmed at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, Calif, which is the mall I grew up shopping in,(And scamming guys) with my friends. I thought the food court looked familiar. (In the scene with Julie and Randy eating, you can see Hot Dog on a Stick in the background.) I know a lot of malls have one, but I'm positive it's Del Amo. Anyone that knows this mall, check it out, and tell me what you think. Anyways, I think that Deborah Foreman was ""like totally"" gyped out the credit she deserves for being so great in this movie, and she is much cuter than that other girl, whoever she may be.

Like Julie's dad says- ""Things were different back then.  Different priorities. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll."" (not sure that's an exact quote, but it's close).

Julie, the main character, has a good-looking boyfriend, but feels the relationship is getting old.  Plus, Tommy (the name of her boyfriend) is a complete jerk. Julie meets this guy named Randy at a party and immediately takes a liking to him (and vice versa).  He's a Hollywood punker, he may not be a part of their group, but he's really a great guy--sensitive, caring, and above all, he loves Julie.  Julie is smart enough to see past his appearance and love him for the person he is, but her shallow friends can't see beyond that.  They want her to be with Tommy because he's ""so good-looking"".
