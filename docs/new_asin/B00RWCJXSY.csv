8696100,1,B00RWCJXSY,The package was empty when I unwrapped the cellophane wrapper. I will have to return the empty case for a refund.,1509062400,,113,4.428571428571429
8696101,3,B00RWCJXSY,OK if you can get past the machine-gun delivery of the instructions.  I find her voice and delivery to be stress-inducing.,1486339200,,122,4.809523809523809

8696103,5,B00RWCJXSY,I thought this would be scaled down and it is. But the nice thing is she let's you decide how far you go. Really nice yoga and she's very gentle and inspiring. A genuine person.,1444953600,,177,4.085714285714285
8696104,4,B00RWCJXSY,"Abby is a really great instructor for people who are older and/or heavier than the average yoga student. She puts viewers at ease and modifies some of the more challenging poses. I have bought other yoga DVD's that claim to do what Abby does, but they just go through the yoga poses like any regular yoga class. I am heavy with back problems, but I feel wonderful after these short sessions and relaxation cool down. I love her longer sessions on her other DVD's, but this one is great for those with limited time.",1438128000,6,514,4.4787234042553195
8696105,5,B00RWCJXSY,"I have this DVD, and it is a key component of my health goals. I love the shorter sessions, and can easily do two of them back to back if I have more time.  I love her other DVDs because they are in a class environment, and it is good to see how each move looks on a variety of bodies.  This DVD is great for a different reason - it is just Abby on the screen, and each session feels like a one-on-one session.

Yoga in a larger body is a different animal, and the logistics are important to a healthy, pain-free work out.  While it is possible to make these adjustments with typical yoga videos, I rarely need to make adjustments with Abby's videos because they are already built into the routine, with options to make certain moves easier or more difficult.  If you're in the Austin, TX area, you should check out her live sessions, which are just wonderful.",1435190400,6,860,4.283950617283951
8696106,4,B00RWCJXSY,"I've owned the original Heavyweight Yoga DVD for a while now, and liked the idea of doing a 25 minute routine.  There are 5 sessions to choose from, each with a different focus (e.g., core strengthening, flexibility, etc.)  Though I haven't tried all 5 sessions, the 2 I have tried are really good.  Don't expect them to be easy!! Abby is amazing and these are really good workouts.  There is 1 aspect of this DVD that that I find a little unpleasant.  Because of the shortened time, things do seem to move at a pretty quick pace.  Abby talks virtually throughout the entire session, giving directions for each of the moves.  I definitely recommend it though.",1428796800,7,659,4.629310344827586
