4262364,5,B0044XI15U,I love WWE and this video shows a lot of great moments. Thanks for sending it on time with the correct item.,1355616000,,108,3.9545454545454546
4262365,3,B0044XI15U,"In support of WWE's latest film called ""Legendary"" starring John Cena, WWE quietly released a DVD called ""Legendary Moments"" that Cena also hosted. This is pretty much a ""no frills"" set in that it goes for around an 90 mins. with no bonus extras & is just strictly highlights & video packages of past moments in WWE history.

Now it should be noted that there were no moments on here that happened BEFORE the ""Attitude Era"" which means moments like ""The Boyhood Dream Has Come True For Shawn Michaels"", ""Hulkamania Is Here"", ""Superfly Pearched 15 High!"", and other moments that older WWF/E fans would still regard are legendary to this day aren't listed here. It should also be noted that some of these clips are just repeats from other sets like the SmackDown 10th Anniversary DVD.

Anyways, here's the listing for the various moments featured:
-Steve Austin wins his first WWE Championship
-DX Invades WCW Nitro
-Chris Jericho's WWE Debut
-Mankind's ""This Is Your Life"" With The Rock
-Arnold schwarzenegger Appears On SmackDown
-Austin vs. The Rock At WrestleMania XV
-Steve Austin Gives Vince, Shane & The Rock A Beer Bath
-Steve Austin & Kurt Angle Sing To Vince McMahon
-T.L.C. II From WrestleMania X-7
-The Rock's Greatest Punchlines
-Triple H's Return From Injury At Madison Square Garden
-The 9/11 SmackDown Tribute Show
-John Cena's Debut
-Chris Jericho Becomes The First Undisputed Champion
-Brock Lesnar & Big Show Destroy The Ring On SmackDown
-Kane Unmasked
-John Cena Wins His First WWE Championship & Creates The ""Spinner"" Belt
-The WrestleMania 23 ""Battle Of The Billionares""
-Eddie Guerrero's Championship Celebration On SmackDown
-The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan At WrestleMania X-8
-Edge's First Money In The Bank
-DX's Greatest Hits
-Rey Mysterio Sets A Royal Rumble Record
-John Cena Returns & Wins The Royal Rumble
-Steve Austin Goes In The WWF Hall Of Fame
-Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker At WrestleMania 25
-Bret Hart Returns To The WWE
-Shawn Michaels Retires
-Tribute To The Troops

In the end, this list will always be debateable (again, the fact that they had nothing before the Attitude Era makes that clear) but just talking this DVD for what it is as a nice look of highlights from a little over the past decade and the fact that you can buy this at the retail store for just $10...it's worth getting if your a newer fan who wasn't around or seen most of these but if your a long term fan then I would suggest getting this if you don't already have most of these moments elsewhere.",1287878400,4,2503,4.82983682983683
