6681138,5,B00NVMDIBC,Mia is awesome in class and on the video!  So glad she made one for when I travel.,1420243200,,82,3.5555555555555554
6681139,4,B00NVMDIBC,"I really like the yoga programs, but they are too difficult for someone who is older and not in good shape.  I'm sure they are fine for someone who does yoga everyday and has been doing so for years.  But I cannot complete them.  I need to find something a bit easier.",1420070400,9,268,4.115384615384615
6681140,5,B00NVMDIBC,I agree with Ira (whom I do not know!)  I practice with Mia in Santa Monica every chance that I can and am completely spoiled by her teaching style.  She is compassionate while gently encouraging us take risks.  She focuses on form and continually connects how to use what we learn in yoga in our everyday life.  I adore her and HIGHLY recommend this video.  You will not want to take yoga from anyone else.,1418515200,,407,4.373333333333333
6681141,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I have almost all the Element DVDs.  I have enjoyed every one I own and this one is no excpetion.  This DVD has two segments.  One for AM and one for PM.  They are each about 35-40 minutes.  This DVD is not to be confused with Element's AM & PM yoga DVD, which I also have.  There is a big difference between the two for me.  The earlier released video is more for relaxation.  I feel very calm, centered, and flexible after that DVD.  This one hits hard.  It seems more for strength and stamina.  Although there are many traditional poses, there were a few sequences in the two segments that seemed unique enough that I am glad I bought the video.  I recommend.",1418083200,22,662,4.25
6681142,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I am very privileged to be able to practice with Mia when Im at home in Santa Monica.  Her instructions are lucid, she understands yoga on many different levels, and her heart is in the right place.  She is an immensely gifted teacher and always inspires me to explore my practice from fresh perspectives.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to practice with an authentic, compassionate teacher - Im taking a copy of it on the road with me when I travel!",1417305600,7,468,4.482352941176471
6681143,2,B00NVMDIBC,"DVDs of this collection are not as wonderful as the video trailer implies. For instance, the moves are always the same, there no useful explanation about why she is doing this move and not another one. I wanted to have a routine before going to bed, but 40 minutes is far too long. The one for the morning is a bit too challenging and again 35-40 minutes.
On the good side, moves are easy and accessible to beginners.",1438300800,,417,4.358974358974359
6681144,3,B00NVMDIBC,"I like the yoga content of the DVD, it just seemed like (at times) that she was trying to copy Kathryn Budig's style... maybe that's just me? But I noticed it so much I wondered if maybe they were related?",1429228800,,205,4.15
6681145,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I have various yoga dvds and this is a great addition that I will be using frequently. As in all the Element dvds, the setting is lovely. There are two workouts approximately 36-38 minutes each. Mia is a really clear & calm instructor and her poses offer some nice variety to what you typically find in a yoga program. The AM practice has a few challenging poses, but you can always modify them. Overall, it's very do-able. The evening is just wonderfully relaxing and stretchy. I hope this instructor puts out more practices.",1428883200,,526,4.666666666666667
6681146,5,B00NVMDIBC,Great workout! Loved outdoor setting! Very happy! :),1428192000,,52,5.625
6681147,4,B00NVMDIBC,Mia Togo is extremely talented. I'm a little old for her workout but she gives a great and strenuous session,1427500800,,108,4.45
6681148,5,B00NVMDIBC,"Bought this for our (leaderless) yoga group, and it's a hit!  Mia has a very nice style and instructions are clear.  Appreciate getting 2 programs.  Our group ranges in age from mid-40s to 70, and we all enjoy this DVD.  It's interesting without being too difficult, and I especially like how she transitions smoothly between poses.  I'd love to have more of her DVDs.",1424908800,4,368,4.6875
6681149,3,B00NVMDIBC,For people whith lots of condition very goed option,1424736000,,51,4.777777777777778
6681150,5,B00NVMDIBC,Yes She is Amaizing!! I Enjoy it everyday!!!!,1424563200,,45,4.75
6681151,3,B00NVMDIBC,"this is not a beginners DVD.  I did the morning session and it has some very challenging moves.  I work out every day with Kelly Coffey, Paul Katami, and others and I found this to be more of a solid intermediate workout.",1424131200,3,221,4.238095238095238
6681152,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I have alot of exercise dvd's and really love this one. So far, I only did the morning outine twice. It is approximately 40 minutes. Great yoga poses and her instruction is right on target. I find it easy to transition from one pose to another. The only pose I probably can never do in my lifetime 9besides head stand) is 3 legged dog. I started to hold on to a chair for this one. Great dvd at a great price.",1421193600,3,409,4.061728395061729
8680487,1,B00NVMDIBC,too much talking,1523145600,,16,4.666666666666667
8680488,5,B00NVMDIBC,I only did the evening practice and it was nice.  She has a nice calming yogic presence. Will do this one again!,1514419200,,112,4.090909090909091
8680489,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I have several Yoga DVD routines and I'm in love with this morning routine, easily my top routine. Not only is it intense, but it's also fairly short (~38 minutes if you don't count the last 5ish minutes of resting pose) which is perfect for getting done first thing in the morning. I love the flows and Mia provides fantastic guidance.",1504915200,,336,4.524590163934426
8680490,5,B00NVMDIBC,Very complete and instructive video. Pose names and an extensive workout for morning and evening. Intermediate level.,1475971200,,117,5.9411764705882355
8680491,5,B00NVMDIBC,I love the Element Yoga series. Mia Togo is great.  I wish she had another DVDs.  I can't wait until she makes another one.,1464825600,,123,4.083333333333333
8680492,5,B00NVMDIBC,Very soothing and worth getting. I love this.,1456790400,,45,4.75
8680493,5,B00NVMDIBC,I enjoy this DVD. Mia's voice is soothing & the instructions are clear. I am a beginner and particularly enjoy the p.m. session. When I am feeling energetic I do the a.m. session and enjoy it. My back & shoulders in particular feel better & stronger. I find the gentle P.M. stretches really relax my mind and muscles.,1455062400,,317,4.482758620689655
8680494,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I have quite a collection of yoga DVDs but this is my all time favorite. Her voice, philosophy, and the superb poses make me reach for it a few times a week.  You won't be disappointed.",1447372800,,185,4.138888888888889
8680495,5,B00NVMDIBC,"LOVE this video!  The two routines that Mia Togo teach are invigorating and relaxing, and have been my go to workouts for AM or PM yoga routines.  Mia has a great instrutive voice that both teaches and directs as well as encourages and invigorates.",1441411200,,248,4.613636363636363
8680496,5,B00NVMDIBC,"I loved this yoga video! Mia is a fabulous instructor and really ensures that alignment is key in this flow. I am an advanced beginner and I was challenged, but not way out of my comfort zone. I am hoping she makes another video, perhaps a longer vinyasa flow.",1440806400,,260,4.326530612244898
