He remains true to the folkloric sources, yet the stories are grounded in realism. Though the production values are simple, the quality of the storytelling and acting held the interest of the children I teach. These are kids used to movies loaded with special effects. Davenport's work is a testimony to the power of a good story, simply told.",1436486400,,468,4.8625

8153762,5,B000K14LMW,"This film is so different from the ordinary TV or Hollywood fare.  It is not slick or flashy but has a raw edge that gives it an authentic feel.  Despite being a low budget production, there was some fine acting especially by Robbie Sams, the girl who played Mutzmag, the girl who played Poll who played a mean sister of Mutzmag and, the actress who played the witch.  I have the film on VHS and was considering buying it on DVD though 39.95 is a little steep.  This should give you an idea how much I like it.  UPDATE:  The film can now be purchased at https://squareup.com/market/davenportfilms for $19.95 or as part of a set of 7 films by this same producer for $95.00.  I bought the entire set recently.",1299369600,,707,4.392307692307693
8153763,5,B000K14LMW,I love Davenport Film's Tales from the Brother's Grimm.  Mutzmag was one of my favorites when it was on PBS in the 1990's.  I would love to buy this on DVD but $39.95 is way too expensive for a single episode 52 minute DVD.,1232496000,2,223,4.045454545454546
8153764,5,B000K14LMW,"I was so excited to find the Appalachian folktales for sale on DVD.  My kids who are all now teens and beyond, wathched these on PBS when they were little and thought they were the greatest.  This one is a little scary for the little kids but it is all in fun and very memorable experience. I think all kids should see each one of these before they grow up.",1175817600,2,357,4.085714285714285
