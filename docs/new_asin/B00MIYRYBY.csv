6583429,5,B00MIYRYBY,"I missed this the first time it came around,so glad it is now in DVD.  The series tried to combine high fantasy with low-level comedy and it didn't quite succeed.  Should have kept to high fantasy, since the costumes and characters were good.  Best is Prince Blackpool (Duncan Regehr) who ,although a villain, is a compelling character! Julia Duffy is annoying as the spoiled Princess. Wizards are good! Regardless, it's good entertainment, and I wish they had made more than the 8 1-hour episodes.",1410566400,10,498,4.904761904761905
6583430,4,B00MIYRYBY,"Another reviewer said it, and I agree - Duncan Regehr is the best thing about this series.

Even if you forget for a moment that he is easy on the the eyes, his acting is superb. Julia Duffy does a nice job; actually they all do except one... I am sorry to say that Jeff Conaway is as dismal an actor as he ever was. His acting is one-dimensional and, for this role, ineffective.

But it is a (semi) forgotten series of the 80s certainly worth a peek....",1489190400,,454,4.1477272727272725
6583431,4,B00MIYRYBY,"Wizards and Warriors: The Complete Series,"" a fantasy that combines adventure and humor, is set in the time of King Arthurs Court, when gallant knights battled the forces of evil with magic, sorcery, and sheer derring-do. The prize was the legendary kingdom of Camarand, ruled by King Baaldorf and Queen Lattinia. Their daughter, Princess Ariel, was betrothed to Prince Erik Greystone (Jeff Conway, Taxi) who, along with his strongman sidekick Marko (Walter Olkewicz), is the primary defender of the realm. Evil Prince Dirk Blackpool (Duncan Regehr) and malevolent magic-user Vector (Clive Revill) seek to conquer Camarand through the black arts.

The light touch applied to the episodes prevents Wizards and Warriors from becoming yet another spectacle that takes itself too seriously. Conway uses his comic timing and delivery to get in some witty quips amid the action, grounding the program and making it a lot of fun. It delivers with its cool visuals  ghosts, demons, fiery swords, magical amulets  and imaginary production design, as well as with well-placed humor.

Wizards and Warriors aired from February 28 through May 14, 1983. All 8 episodes of the short-lived series are contained on the 2-disc unrated, full-screen DVD set. There are no bonus features.",1486944000,,1267,5.288557213930348

6583437,5,B00MIYRYBY,"This series was amazing, When it was canceled I was pretty upset. It seems the network executives wouldn't know a good show if it bit them on the behind. I thought I would never see it again but when I saw it advertised I had to scoop it up. I only hope they will release the Phoenix with judsen scott.",1469145600,2,302,4.05
6583438,5,B00MIYRYBY,This brought back great memories for my husband. It was my first time watching it and I thought it was better than I expected.,1467244800,,126,4.291666666666667
6583439,1,B00MIYRYBY,"This show did not age well. I only saw one or two episodes when it first aired, but I remembered it as very funny. I'm fond of several of the actors, so I ordered the series. I started with the first episode, but it was so trite and long-winded that I skipped over to three others ( the ones that looked funniest). Sadly, they were awful and I could only watch parts of them before giving up. I sent it back for a refund, but because I had opened the package, I got back approximately $8.00 out of $25.00.",1466726400,,505,4.111111111111111
6583440,5,B00MIYRYBY,"I have been looking for this for YEARS. We had recorded it, back in the day, on VHS tape, but this is ever-so-much better.  I love watching all the stars and the tongue-in-cheek dialogue.",1465776000,,187,4.5
6583441,5,B00MIYRYBY,"I remember racing for the TV those eight short weeks this was on when I was a kid. This was a show before its time, before a generation of kids grew up with Harry Potter and made fantasy a mainstream genre. A mix of a hilarious spoof of the medieval fantasy genre and actual exciting adventures (great swordfighting scenes!) and an underlying plot of a war between two kingdoms that many no longer knew the origin of, or why they were fighting it. The show was elevated to something special by the fantastic three dimensional 'villain', Dirk Blackpool, played by the talented, tall, dark and handsome Duncan Regehr. Black leather never looked so good.",1465430400,7,651,4.719298245614035
6583442,5,B00MIYRYBY,Saw this as a child.,1465344000,,20,3.2
6583443,5,B00MIYRYBY,"I watched this as a kid when it was originally aired in 1983. This is very much a show from the 80s.  The plot was always a tad silly but it worked.  I bought this for nostalgia and to try and preserve some of these great shows.  I would think the only reason you would want to buy this is that you saw it when it originally aired and liked it.  It is family friendly but there may not be much for a modern child to enjoy.  It's enjoyable to me but the poorly designed sets, flat acting, and ridiculous story lines will not be enough to entertain most others.  The DVD set does not include anything special, just the 8 original episodes.  There is not episode listing or additional information within the case, discs only.  The episode titles are printed on the discs.  The episode quality is pretty standard for these releases.  It's listed at a resolution of 480p, full-screen, but given the original broadcast it's probably the broadcast standard of analog TV which at it's best was 240p.  It looks blurry on my 50 inch plasma when viewed close, but from a distance it's decent enough.  I've watched through the limited series and it is still as fun as it was 33 years ago.",1461110400,7,1176,4.393518518518518
6583444,5,B00MIYRYBY,One of the most intelligent series ever written. That's why it was discontinued.,1458864000,,80,5.230769230769231
6583445,4,B00MIYRYBY,"Pretty much as remembered when I watched it on TV you wanted originally aired it is your typical good offering of 1980s TV show worth owning and watching again, and realizing how TV has radically changed over the years",1458518400,,218,4.615384615384615
6583446,5,B00MIYRYBY,"Loved this series as a kid - great humor, campy and fun, really wish there had been more episodes.",1455926400,,98,4.2105263157894735

6583448,3,B00MIYRYBY,"I watched this show in the 80's when I was in high school.  I love fantasy, and this was the closest thing to it on television at the time.

Well, now I'm much older.  I find the show barely watchable now.  The stories are paper-thin, the writing is mostly bad, with lots of empty conversation designed to fill up an hour time slot.

The king in this show rules over a realm, but apparently a realm consists of 10 people.  The sets are bare bones.

The only bright spots are the occasional witty lines, perhaps 2 or 3 per episode, Julia Duffy, and Duncan Regehr's leather outfit.

I really don't understand all the 5 star reviews.  People think this is great entertainment?  The only value it holds for me is nostalgic.

If you didn't see this show in the 80's, I doubt you will like it now.",1451001600,2,791,4.312925170068027

6583455,3,B00MIYRYBY,"I loved the series and couldn't wait for this to become available.  I gave up watching after three episodes because the fight scenes were consistently DARK!

6583463,5,B00MIYRYBY,The best part if this is Blackpool with Vector second.  I know it was a spoof but the good guys are really annoying.  Blackpool's dialogue is so funny because he seems such a cut above yet he can't win.,1417046400,6,202,4.153846153846154

6583467,5,B00MIYRYBY,"I have been waiting many years for this to come out on video.  The best part of the show is Duncan Regeher,  It is this show that has influenced me in watching most of the other things he has been in - including V.  Great actor !!  Seeing the show once again has reminded me how the blingy costumes were also appealing. I think this is the show Jeff Conaway did after Grease - never liked his character - too rigid for a hero,",1411776000,18,426,4.035714285714286
6583468,4,B00MIYRYBY,"Loved the series. Had some episodes on tape from my VCR and found some eps on YouTube. Quality was just not that good. The whites especially were washed out in some scenes. I was hoping the series would surface on DVD and surprisingly it did.
DVD packaging is bare bones.  No extras, No trailers. Nada.. Just the episodes. No booklet or any other info about the series. Packaging looked cheap. The good news is that it did have 2 DVDs with the episodes.
I was able to play the DVD in my computer although the packaging did state that it might NOT play in a computer drive.
Picture quality looked good. Scanned some of the scenes that had been washed out and they looked good.
I don't buy many DVD series anymore but this is one that I was willing to put my money down for.
Now waiting for some other non- releases such as VR5 and She Loves Me (BBC Musical).",1411603200,7,857,4.290123456790123

8672694,2,B00MIYRYBY,"The copy I got was defective and one disk did not play

The setup of the disk is TERRIBLE.  Once you start watching, there is no way to go back to the episode menu; you have to watch the whole thing.  Going back was not allowed (it showed the little prohibited sign you get when you can't fast forward TV shows because they want you to watch commercials) On the second disk I was unable to choose an episode, but could only choose to watch the whole disk. There is no scene selection.

Basically, you can plug in the DVD and watch it from start to finish, all four episodes on a disk, and nothing else.

There's no excuse for design like that in this day and age.

Love the TV show (hence the second star) Hope they fix the quality issues",1528588800,,738,4.161971830985915
