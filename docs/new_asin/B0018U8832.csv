We have now had a chance to watch the series twice. In both viewings, episode 12 through 16 are failing and cannot be played. They freeze up and the disc has to be ejected. We have tried this on two different players with same result.",1460332800,,314,4.413793103448276
8271202,5,B0018U8832,"Krniken is an ideal addition to any DVD collection. Krniken tells the story of the Nielsen family between 1949 and 1972. A wealthy Copenhagen family whose head is Kaj Holger, a businessman who owns a radio manufaturers. Kaj Holger has two children, Ss, the aspiring actress and Erik, who seems to never be able to please his father. Their Swedish mother Karin holds the family together as they endure life in the Fifties and Sixties, times of change for all the family. We also meet the Froms and the Nrregard family who establish firm connections with the Nielsens.
A fantastic regular cast featuring performers from the best of Danish acting talents produce nearly 22 hours of quality drama. Regulars include Ken Vedsegaard, Stina Ekblad, Anders W. Berthelsen, Dick Kays, Pernille Hjmark, Waage Sand, Maibritt Saerens and Anne Louise Hassing. There are some fine performances from the many guest actors in this too including Mikael Birkkjr, Lars Mikkelsen, Nicolas Bro, Bjarne Henriksen, Finn Nielsen, Pernille Agger, Lars Knutzon, Bodil Jrgensen, Peter Schrder, Peter Gantzler, Thomas Levin, Mads M. Nielsen, Troels Lyby, Michael Moritzen and Jesper Lohmann among many others.
This Krniken boxset is a beautiful collection of ten discs featuring the whole series along with bonus features. The set is exactly the same as the individual volumes but does not feature the 19 track CD which is included in volume 11. All the other extras, behind the scenes material and DR newsreels as on the volumes is featured here. The boxset really is a treasure to own and looks like a book. It opens out into pages detailing the episodes with fantastic pictures, with each disc securely slotted into the every other page. The episode details are in Danish, and are the same as on the individual volumes.
Just as the volumes with English subtitles are now quite rare, this boxset is just as rare, but is a fine addition to any DVD collection.
Enjoy!",1340236800,9,1937,4.981481481481482
