2961996,4,6301286510,"In THROUGH NAKED EYES, David Soul (TV's 'SALEM'S LOT, TV's STARSKY AND HUTCH) plays a flautist (!) named William Parrish, and Pam Dawber (THE GIRL, THE GOLD WATCH, AND EVERYTHING, TV's MORK AND MINDY) plays Anne Walsh, an aspiring photo-journalist. The two live directly across from each other in opposite high-rise apartment buildings. At night, they watch each other through binoculars and a camera respectively. After coincidentally crossing paths several times, the two decide to meet. They hit it off right away, and Bill entertains Anne w/ his instrument. Meanwhile, a maniacal murderer is killing off residents w/ a big knife. The police begin to suspect Parrish, after he is the last to see one of the victims alive. This could really interfere w/ his flute practice! THROUGH NAKED EYES is a made-for-TV thriller from 1983. As such, it tends to drag a bit in spots, and bog down in romantic cheeeze, but rebounds quite well in the end. If you are a Soul or Dawber fanatic (and who isn't?), then you won't be disappointed...  P.S.- Watch for Ted Levine (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, TV's MONK) as a uniform cop!...",1382227200,2,1135,4.850515463917525
2961997,3,6301286510,"Not a bad show, but it was a bit slow in parts. If I wasn't so smitten with Pam Dawber, I might have taken off one star on the rating. Still, I think it is worth watching. Even though it was not great, it is better than many current titles. The old fashioned sets etc. add to the interest for me.

What about the blue an the beige? It seems that most of the characters wear light blue and/or beige in almost every scene. It must have really been in style. If you want to have some extra fun with this not-so-great movie, sit down with your favorite beverage and take a sip every time you see a character wearing blue or beige - and take two sips if they are wearing both. You can always pause it every time you need to use the restroom.",1377648000,,736,4.041095890410959
2961998,3,6301286510,"The movie was shot in an apartment building on Marine Drive in Chicago, facing Lake
Michigan.  I was performing as an extra in front of the building during the day, and
the director, John L. Moxey, a nice Englishman with a Levi jacket decorated with
alot of buttons, asked if I could stay until late that night to shoot the last
scene.  I agreed, and went to the ballroom to try to sleep.  Finally, about 2 a.m.,
I was summoned up to the unit where they were finishing.  I went for makeup in the
bathroom and met David Soul, who smiled broadly and was most kind.  Then I stepped
up to my video camera and enacted the scene, in two takes.  Unfortunately, you
can't see my face, just the top of my head and my shirt.  This was in Sept. 1983.
I enjoyed doing it, although the film proved to be watered-down ""Rear Window.""",1348876800,3,818,4.2727272727272725

I like David Soul and Pam Dawber and that's why I decided to watch the movie.  Yes, there are some slow parts to this movie.  David Soul almost seems uncomfortable playing his role in some of the scenes.  So if that's what he was suppose to do, he did it well.  I will probably watch this movie again somewhere down the road.",1432080000,,468,4.32183908045977
8221408,1,6301286510,"This is loosely based on Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 ""Rear Window"" with Jimmy Stewart and (Princess) Grace Kelly. That was a 4+ out of 5. This is a stinko bomb 1- . David Soul is no Jimmy Stewart. Pam Dawber is no Grace Kelly. It was a made-for-TV mess thrown together without the care and magic of a Hitchcock pulling the strings. There are so many creepy slow sections... It's just boring bad acting and bad pacing. Don't waste your time.",1419379200,,436,4.4625
