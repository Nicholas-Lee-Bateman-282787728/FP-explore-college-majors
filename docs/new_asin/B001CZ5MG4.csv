I  got this one about the same time as I got the 2012 tattoo however, so it did get a bit overshadowed.  This is definitely a great video and worth watching over and over.  My husband is very fond of the Royal Marine's Band so what can I say.",1417219200,,317,3.890625
8290447,5,B001CZ5MG4,"We enjoyed it thoroughly and reminded us of the pleasant time we spent at the Tattoo. Of course, the editors had to leave out quite a bit and we would have been pleased to see some the performances we enjoyed in person, but were left out.
We will share it with others who might enjoy seeing all the different groups from around the world.

8290448,5,B001CZ5MG4,"The Edinburgh Military Tattoo happens every year at the Edinburgh Castle Esplanade! Bands from all over the world are invited to come and perform in front of thousands of people each night during the month of August!

This particular year, I had the opportunity to perform with my college band, the Golden Eagles Marching Band! Having experience with the tattoo prior to performing in the show, I still say this was one of the best Tattoo years!

This particular year featured The Massed Military and Pipe Bands from entire show, The Golden Eagles Marching Band featuring a variety of American music and dance, The King's Guard of Norway (always a delight to see perform), The Singapore Police Bands with the dancing lion (always fun to see!!), Queen Victorian School Dunblane (group of young boys and girls that gave up their summer holiday to perform an amazing show based on the Red Hot Chili Pipers), Indian Army Chief of Staff Band (interesting Indian martial music), and the New Zealand dance and drill team among the many other talents there! My favorite part of the show was the finale where a tune called ""The Gale"" is featured from the Last of the Mohicans.

Truly an amazing show! I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in seeing a variety of music from around the world in one amazing show!!!!",1357430400,,1317,4.767543859649122
8290449,5,B001CZ5MG4,"This is probably one of the better Tattoo years.  The massed bands of the Royal Marines play a rather modern medley of music, but their display is still great.  They were not long ago featured in the 2005 Tattoo.

Guest bands include the Indian Army Chief of Staff band which provides for a really interesting display of Indian martial music.  This band still looks and sounds like the days of the Raj almost.  The music has significant British influences.

The King's Guard of Norway makes yet another appearance this year as well.  The band and Drill Team are always a delight to see.  Their program was also more modern than in recent years.  This band seems to visit the Tattoo almost every few years now.  As much as I enjoy seeing them is there a reason why another foreign band could not be seen instead?

I would say one of the major highlights of this year's Tattoo was the spirited display by the Victorians from the Queen Victoria School Dunblane.  These young boys and now a few girls are offspring of British servicemen.  Their pipe band and dancers performed a traditional and very spirited Broadswords Medley to the delight of the audience.  This is real Scottish tradition being kept alive here by these young students.  They gave up their summer holiday in order to perform in the Tattoo and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the school's foundation.

One of the better Tattoo years despite some repeated bands from not too long ago.  Great extras and behind the scenes info. are included.",1317686400,3,1510,4.702290076335878
