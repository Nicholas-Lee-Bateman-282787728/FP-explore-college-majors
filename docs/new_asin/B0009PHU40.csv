Sexy chick with leathers and a leopard print flimsy top makes you want to view the movie, but don't be fooled!  The slip cover art is the best part of the whole movie.  In my day, the movie would be called a ""barker"" or a ""dog"".  I give it a ""10"" on the ""Biker Scale"".  The Biker Scale means how many real bikers it would take to drag me to my couch and make me watch it again.

The bikes are crappy, the bikers are wannabees, the story line is lame, the hep talk is corny, the chicks are desirable - but only after a 12 pack.  I love biker movies, and usually find some redeeming quality in the worst of them.  But seriously, this one is BAD!",1273881600,,711,3.923076923076923
