Film = barely three (3) stars; production design = three (3) stars; subtitles = three (3) stars; music = two (2) stars; cinematography and lighting = two (2) stars; restoration/preservation = two (2) stars.  Director Mikio Naruse provides a slice-of-life shomin-geki (home drama) statement on the status of post-war contemporary married life.  The Director's assessment is far from optimistic.  Aging parents (who have their own lingering marital difficulties) are saddled with the marriage problems of aging children who either refuse to leave home or keep moving back in.  There is a son (a philander with a mistress following in his father's footsteps) and his wife (who is little more than a child-like housemaid) in residence and a daughter (with two kids, one a baby) who keeps leaving her husband and turning up.  This goes on to the point where the parents decide to leave home themselves (and move back to the country) to escape this mess (most of which seems to stem from inadequate past/present parenting and being poor roll models).  Thrown into the pot are the emotional impacts of abortions, a "" jimusho-geki"" (office drama) as a subplot--the father and son work in adjourning bank offices with ""office flowers""--and the sub-rosa lechery of the father's extended parenting of his daughter in-law.  Naruse's pace is plodding and often close to boring.  His many nuances are hard to capture in subtitles plus the Kansai-ben dialect used for line deliveries may be a challenge for the viewer.  The Director's actresses and actors turn in mostly solid (if unexceptional) performances (but one child actress steals every scene she is in!) except for his star Setsuko Hara.  Hara's delivery is disappointing and ranges from embarrassingly phony child-like sugar sweet to overly stoic.  Sadly her makeup and lighting are far from flattering and a major distraction.  Interior and exterior sets may look familiar, since they are been used in many Toho productions.  Music is mostly continuous and continuingly boring.  Subtitles try their best given the circumstances (see above). Cinematography (narrow-screen format, grey and white) is nothing great.  It seems unable to clearly photograph objects against bright backgrounds like the sky.  Lighting continuity between shots is terrible.  It looks like it was ignored on the set and during editing.  Interior scenes can be as foggy as exterior ones (the latter with real fog)!  Restoration/preservation is okay for audio, but inadequate for video (see above).  In case you were wondering if the film's title was picked out of a hat (since it is meaningless!), the script was apparently derived from a contemporary book and the same name was used to piggyback on the popularity of the novel.  Mildly entertaining melodrama.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1515801600,,2960,5.242553191489361
