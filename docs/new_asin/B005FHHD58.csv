4673909,5,B005FHHD58,"If you love Craig, even if you just like him, get this freaking DVD now! I've had it for a few days and I've already watched it three times. I went to his live show in Oklahoma at the Winstar Casino and he did this same show there, so techniquely I've heard this material 4 times, and I'm still laughing at everything until my side hurts and I start crying. And I'm probably annoying my dad because I'm laughing so loud. I love Craig Ferguson so much and if it wasn't for him, I might be here right now. I have depression, so whenever its really bad to where something really bad might happen, I either watch his nightly show, watch ""A Wee Bit o' Revolution"" or, now, this DVD, and I literally feel a million times better. This DVD is so hilarious and I highly recommend you get it. You know, I heard a man in London died because he laughed 25 minutes straight. I don't believe this because I laugh through this entire show, and I'm still here. And I'm pretty sure this show is longer than 25 minutes. GET THIS DVD NOW!!!!",1319414400,50,1022,4.246153846153846

4673959,5,B005FHHD58,"Does This Need to be Said? Craig Ferguson.
Score: 100 Why I liked it. I favor stand up for about an hour before bed, it leaves me with a pleasantly smooth endorphin wash.  Unlike a negative euphoria, such as may be present with oh, hey...2 grams of coke, but let's ask Craig for his opinion. There you have it.... Ferguson not only delivers , he does so with a subtle tone, body language, twinkly eyes and a dash-all smile-I think, if you're reading this little review, good; however, he is ON all the way through. I laughed so hard, my face muscles actually began to ache...I adored his take on Kevin Costner more than I ever thought I would, in non-situational comedy.
Craig is a uproar in and of himself, and YES!
It Does Need to Be Said, NOW!

If you were a fan of him on after Letterman, this is from his prime during that time. Eventually some of the celebrity jokes will get a bit dated, but like all professionals he seems aware of it and its not his focus, which makes this show great to enjoy no matter when.",1461715200,,418,4.109756097560975

No, Craig Furgeson didn't die, he just left CBS's Late Late Show... and possibly tv entirely... Ohhh Nooo!  But have no fear, he's still cranking out stellar standup specials every year and this one is a standout from a few years ago.  Unfortunately, Craig was the last talk show host who had the cajones to do real TALK... Off script, totally unpredictable, and often shockingly candid, he was the last jewel in an industry now completely given over to dull soulless empty heads who desperately grovel in service to the celebrity promotional machine.

The film is a little dated, but not by much, and Ferguson's way of telling a tale, beginning at the start of his performance, then meandering (or running!) away from the original premise, them coming back to it at the end, is what intrigues me about him.  He does offer some belly laughs and there's a hint of homophobia in some of his gestures--however, having known some very manly Scots who would wear their ladies' lingerie if caught without their own clothes at hand, I think it's more cultural 'geste' than that,  Summary: good bit not great.",1447113600,,605,4.583333333333333

I was worried for the first few minutes because I thought all he was gonna do was stand around for an hour and say the ""F"" word a million times. But he gets past that and I really liked the show. I love the Scottish accent and his continued to get thicker the longer he talked. For me it was fairly unique humor and not at all offensive, unless the cursing bothers people. It doesn't me, but he certainly cussed up a storm. I guess there was some sexual humor, but I also do not find that offensive unless it's the only thing the comedian has to offer.

4674422,5,B005FHHD58,"This was the first performance of stand-up by Craig Ferguson that I have seen apart from television.  Hilarious!!!  He drops the F-bomb a lot but it's not really gratuitous.  I laughed my ass off!  Seriously, I had to pick it up and glue it back on.  Craig Ferguson has a unique grasp of humor that I've not experienced in decades.  The way he totally deconstructs the whole talk show genre is brilliant.",1377475200,,404,4.541666666666667
4674423,5,B005FHHD58,"Great show,  if you like Craig you'll love this show...

It's a full show of Craig doing standup routine,  clean enough for teenagers but it not completely safe for work...",1377302400,,172,4.666666666666667
4674424,2,B005FHHD58,"Having the freedom to swear seems to have stunted his humor.  Perhaps on his show, it's having a quick witted guest to play with that makes his humor really soar.  Solo on stage, not so much.",1372550400,,191,4.277777777777778
4674425,5,B005FHHD58,No OOO LALA's here not even a little flag over the mouth so be ready for full on raw Scotish American Humor Craig is AWESOME!!!,1368403200,,127,4.12
4674426,5,B005FHHD58,"Very funny. If you only get one, Buy this one! Better than his tv show because he is not sensored.",1368057600,,98,3.95
4674427,5,B005FHHD58,i came across mr ferguson by accident a couple of years ago. i have to watch the late late show every night and his stand up is even better. i love him,1366156800,,151,3.75
4674428,5,B005FHHD58,"Craig Ferguson is just a funny man.  Not always language friendly for the little folks, but it's okay to have adult thinking humor at times.",1365984000,,140,4.6
4674429,5,B005FHHD58,I love everything by Craig Ferguson. He is so naturally funny and I could listen to his voice all day long.,1364688000,,107,4.142857142857143
4674430,4,B005FHHD58,What can you say when it comes to Craig Ferguson?  Intelligent; a crack humourist and so very original; does it really need to be said?,1361059200,,135,4.4
4674431,5,B005FHHD58,This is a great DVD from Craig Ferguson.  Saw it on TV a while back and wanted to purchase the DVD to watch it a few more times.,1359849600,,128,3.5714285714285716
4674432,5,B005FHHD58,Craig Ferguson dishing it out in front of a live audience while he is on tour.  It's so much fun as he cuts on and makes fun of almost everything worth taking about and maybe not !  Lets hear it for good old Craig!!,1358812800,,215,3.8636363636363638
4674433,3,B005FHHD58,I have seen Craig perform twice and read his books...I was surprised at the tone and language of this performance. I still like him ...just bought copies of his book to give away.... He did warn that he likes profanity and would be profane...so...perhaps it's all on me.,1358208000,,270,4.645833333333333
4674434,5,B005FHHD58,It's not like his TV show its just stand up. But it's pure Craig just the way you like him .... Naughty naughty naughty!  If you like Craig you'll like this video. He's very funny as usual!!!!!,1358121600,,193,4.216216216216216
4674435,5,B005FHHD58,My best friend really likes Craig Ferguson. I purchased this for her and she was ecstatic -- she says it is wonderful. It's a must-have for any Craig fan.,1355097600,,154,4.344827586206897
4674436,5,B005FHHD58,He's all grown up and wants to be able to swear when he feels like it.  Too bad he has to pay a quarter each time to do so.  The lessons he's learned he's more'n willing to share.  And you should all follow his advice.,1351987200,3,218,3.8
4674437,5,B005FHHD58,"Brilliant comedy. Simple as that. What can I say more about it? Craig is hilarious and this is just another standup DVD showing how that is true. I still think there should be behind the scenes things on these DVDs... The standup itself and Craig himself are 1000000+ stars. The DVD's features not so much. Still defiantly worth getting! If you're a Craig fan you should already have this. If you like to laugh but aren't a fan... get this, laugh, then become a fan!",1342051200,2,466,4.4941176470588236
4674438,5,B005FHHD58,"I Love Craig Ferguson!! He is one of my all time favorite's. If you are a female who loves this sexy, hilarious Scotsman, you will love this. It delivers Fergasm's galore!!",1336780800,,172,4.580645161290323
4674439,4,B005FHHD58,"Mostly this is hilarious, but in 2 or 3 places Craig is REALLY contemptuous of women. One place is just after the toads/sex education segment. It is absolutely cruel and offensive.

Take it to your analyst, Craig.",1334016000,4,213,4.756756756756757
4674440,5,B005FHHD58,"What can I say about Craig Ferguson, other than he is one of the funniest comedians around. I have enjoyed all of Craig's standup shows on CD and continue to watch them many times over. The man just makes me laugh! Love his style of comedy!",1333843200,2,240,4.239130434782608
4674441,5,B005FHHD58,"Craig Ferguson is one of a handful of original-styled comedians. He makes me laugh, he's just too much! The handful of comedians I love and respect are, Craig Ferguson, Ron White, Bill Engval, Dennis Miller... I'm sure there may be a few I have missed but these guys are GREAT and the important thing is they make me laugh and that's a GOOOD THING in this day and age!",1332892800,,368,4.3478260869565215
4674442,5,B005FHHD58,"I'm going to preface the review by saying that I'm a huge Craig's fan and think he is the most brilliant comedian/late-night host alive so the review is highly biased. Nonetheless, I've watched other specials featuring Craig and I sincerely think this one is the best of all. Now, you may have caught this particular show on Comedy Central (CC) few months ago and think that I'm crazy rating it at five stars and I wouldn't blame you ;) I watched it first on Netflix and decided to DVR CC's piece and couldn't be more disappointed. What censorship did to this show is nothing short of a crime! Please don't judge this based on what you saw on CC - it really is A DIFFERENT show when enjoyed in the raw form, as Craig intended. After the DVR'ing fiasco I decided I NEED to get this DVD. If you like Ferguson's style of comedy you will simply love it! From the first second to the last bit. Imo, priceless! It would be better if there was a Blu-ray version but come on, this is comedy not sci-fi. GET IT AND ENJOY!",1332460800,12,1012,4.303664921465969
4674443,5,B005FHHD58,"We love Craig Ferguson, so there is almost nothing he could do that we would find fault with.  Even if he did nothing, we'd laugh as soon as we saw his face.  So I guess this review is not that helpful, but he is just intrinsically funny.  He likes to curse but apparently we don't mind cursing when done by a person with a slight accent.",1330905600,7,338,4.090909090909091
4674444,5,B005FHHD58,The dvd was very funny. I did see this show three years ago in Boston. He is a very talented man and you will enjoy this dvd.,1329004800,,125,3.6666666666666665

4674446,5,B005FHHD58,This one is his BEST yet. I'm a LONG time fan & a Craig Watcher. If you like his Late Late Show on CBS you will LOVE his videos even more. Craigy LOVES to 'cuss' & he has a flair for it. I'd listen to him read a phone book & die laughing.,1325376000,7,238,3.509433962264151
4674447,5,B005FHHD58,Absolutely a must buy!  Even better than his 1st DVD; he gets funnier everytime I watch him either on TV or his standup shows.  I just think he's great!,1324944000,,152,4.206896551724138
4674448,5,B005FHHD58,"Ferguson brings his realism and honesty to the stage. His wit is outrageous with a clarity that does not select a specific group, but rather holds a mirror up to our society showing us what is both good and bad about ourselves in a way that helps us laugh. Great video worth seeing again and again.",1320883200,25,298,4.339285714285714

8469940,3,B005FHHD58,It was good but I didn't have any LOL moments. I wouldn't watch it again - his humor just wasn't for me,1510444800,,103,3.727272727272727
8469941,5,B005FHHD58,Always fun to sit back and just enjoy Craig Ferguson on DVD.  He never disappoints.,1506643200,,83,4.533333333333333
8469942,5,B005FHHD58,"This is so funny.  I love Craig Ferguson.  I never missed his Late Night show when it was on.  If you are a fan then you really need to watch this stand up show.  If you are Scottish then you need to watch this stand up show.  If you are American, oh, it doesn't matter, you really should watch this show.  Craig Ferguson, in my opinion, is one of the funniest people on stage & T.V..  He makes fun of everyone, including himself.  Yes, he swears a lot, but it works with him.  I have seen him in live in person and we all never stopped laughing!  This will help you lighten up about life.  So worth your time.  ENJOY!!",1504483200,,619,4.066666666666666

I don't like stupid comedy (which is just stupid, and people are supposed to laugh at it), so I don't get the two guys dancing around the stage before and after. The actual comedy show, however, is awesome.",1498780800,,286,4.627450980392157

8469948,5,B005FHHD58,"This is such a funny set - the best of his shows that I've seen on Prime and EPIX. He's clearly having such a great time on stage, and his mood is infectious. He tells great stories drawn from his life as a Scotsman, and he's in much more in his element here than he ever was on late night tv. Start to finish, this is a funny, entertaining show, and stands up well to rewatching.",1492992000,,380,4.0131578947368425
