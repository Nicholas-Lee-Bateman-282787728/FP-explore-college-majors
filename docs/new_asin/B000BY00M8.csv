8108948,5,B000BY00M8,"My first exposure to Frank Green's work was his terrific film ""Forest Through The Trees"".  ""Counting Sheep"" is another stellar effort, painting the picture of ecobalance that beautifully illustrates and conveys the broader social, political and environmental dialogue taking place amongst conservationists and preservationists.  Where other documentary filmmakers follow Fox News' lead on being ""fair and balanced"", ""Counting Sheep"" presents thoughtful and intriguing insights into all sides of the bighorn sheep debate and leaves the viewer not only more intelligent about this particular issue, but with a broader and deeper perspective on all topics of conservation and ecology.  A first class effort.",1184284800,,704,5.882352941176471

I found myself in awe of these creatures and captivated by the story of unlikely allies working to save them. This is a hopeful film that doesn't shy away from controversy and complexity.
