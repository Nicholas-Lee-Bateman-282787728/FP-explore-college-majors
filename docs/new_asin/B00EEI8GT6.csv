8604764,5,B00EEI8GT6,"BOY, did this bring back memories of the old Sunday morning Southwest Championship Wrestling show on the USA Network.....WAY before RAW.
These guys were WAY ahead of their time with their heel tag team gimmick. Its almost refreshing to see such generic finishing moves such as Flying elbows, Body Splashes and Suplexes. Tully is THE BEST Heel of all time and Gino was lost way before his time. He could have been right by Tully's side in the old Mid Atlantic and Crockett Promotions. The match in the old Sam Houston Coilseum with Ernie Shavers as referee is the highlight here. Many people will complain about the quality but not me. Old school wrestling and the old school in general, deserve to be seen in its originality. Sometimes certain remasters don't come across well. This is a treasure. Thanx a lot High Spots!",1435449600,,821,4.748251748251748
