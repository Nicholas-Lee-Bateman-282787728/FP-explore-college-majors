7669483,4,B01BUQ72H6,"Pretty good, hopefully more comes out soon. This really gives me hope that anime is slowly starting to get better dubbed again. Only problem I have is that there's very little variation in character design but that's pretty common in anime.",1465344000,5,240,4.878048780487805

7669486,5,B01BUQ72H6,I pre-ordered the Limited Edition last month and I love it!!! Can't wait until FUNimation releases part 2 so I can slip it right into the box ^_^,1464134400,3,145,4.214285714285714

7669488,3,B01BUQ72H6,"Great series, so why 3 stars? Blame a poor excuse for a collector's edition from Funimation.

For your extra dollars over the standard edition, you get a glow in the dark box - compare this to the list of extras in the UK release from Universal : Art box, poster, postcards, trading cards and art book, all for roughly the same price as the Funimation version and only lacking the DVDs....",1463961600,7,389,4.47887323943662
7669489,5,B01BUQ72H6,This is different from other but it was strong,1473465600,,46,4.222222222222222
7669490,5,B01BUQ72H6,This is a great show. The characters are very well thought out and the story has plenty of twists to keep you coming back for more. Give it a watch on Funimation before you buy if you are not sure.,1472083200,2,197,3.95
7669491,5,B01BUQ72H6,I was very satisfied with the product.,1471996800,,38,4.571428571428571
7669492,5,B01BUQ72H6,"Came with 4 discs: 2 DVDs, 2 Blurays. I don't know about the Blurays, since I don't have a Bluray player, but the DVDs had lots of extras on them; episode commentaries, trailers, textless opening and ending, and what looks to me the whole first cour of the ""Seraph of the Endless"" comedic shorts. Also episodes 1-12 of the series proper. There was also a nifty little ""marathon"" option in the menu, which I haven't seen before, which allows you to play the episodes one after another, but cuts out the previews and the opening and ending themes between episodes (the opening will still play before the first episode, and the ending will play after the last one), so you don't have to see them ad nauseum.",1470614400,9,704,4.551181102362205
7669493,4,B01BUQ72H6,I've heard of this anime before but never saw it. So when i was walking through wal-mart and happened to see this in with the dvd series (yeah i only got it in dvd) and Tokyo ghoul i was torn to which i should buy. I ended up choosing this anime. I loved it from the start to the end (not the series end cause a second part is coming out in September that i can't wait to get!!!) I really did enjoy it the whole time watching. Now i can't wait for the second part and i'm remembering my rule on how i don't buy new anime unless released in a complete collection for this express reason.,1470528000,,586,3.9745762711864407
7669494,1,B01BUQ72H6,I love the series. But the cover was dented. I'm just gonna buy the collector's edition when it comes out.,1470096000,,106,4.35
7669495,5,B01BUQ72H6,it was great i cant wait for the next part,1469232000,,42,3.3
7669496,5,B01BUQ72H6,"Headline says it all. I love the storyline of this anime. It's meaning, it's connections to other characters, the english voice cast, etc. Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out!",1468195200,2,190,4.617647058823529
7669497,5,B01BUQ72H6,This is by far one of the Best Anime's I've seen In Years. From the beautiful art style to the great emotional story and action is bar none. Also one of the best dubbed Anime I've seen in a bit. I hope that the second season comes sooner rather than later. I highly recommend this to a true lover or Anime or if you're starting to watch Anime this is great either way!,1465430400,6,368,4.054794520547945
7669498,5,B01BUQ72H6,"awesome anime to add to the collection

came on time
5/5",1465344000,,85,4.375
8751540,5,B01BUQ72H6,"This is a love story about two dudes who are supposed to kill each other. The postapocalyptic stew of occult horror, teen drama, and military SF may be derivative -- what anime series isn't? -- but it's the bromance between vampire Mika and vampire slayer Yu that brings a spicy new seasoning to the mix and turns SERAPH OF THE END into a very special horror-fantasy dish.

From the moment that childhood friends Yu and Mika are tragically separated, it's the agonizingly slow buildup (for all the blood, monsters, and action the show throws at us) to their inevitable reunion as enemies that powers season one's first story arc. It's a kind of emotional foreplay; we know we're being manipulated, but it just feels so good.

The show doesn't cross over into BL territory, although our two male leads are clearly in love with each other (platonically or not), and there's something very Montague and Capulet about the political machinations on both the vampire and human sides that serve to keep them apart. A Bill Evans piano recording of ""My Foolish Heart"" turns up on the soundtrack in a couple of episodes: not the most subtle of audio cues, but very  propos.

I don't want to give short shrift to the supporting cast: Shinoa, Guren, Yoichi, Mitsuba, and Kimizuki are interesting characters with significant issues of their own to work through, but this show really does belong to the boys who take the term ""blood brother"" to another level.",1517270400,,1445,4.791164658634538

8751542,5,B01BUQ72H6,from a collector's perspective this is probably the best thing on my shelf. the story though is mostly a school/teen drama with vampires thrown into the mix and very similar to God Eater...,1491436800,,189,4.757575757575758
8751543,5,B01BUQ72H6,This is the second best anime ever I wish the second season would come out soon so I could get it I love this anime,1487635200,,115,3.64
8751544,5,B01BUQ72H6,"One of the few animes I can watch.  This Anime is so well written, with heart wrenching moments, and a well thought out plot.",1487203200,,125,4.208333333333333
8751545,3,B01BUQ72H6,"Most anime have a complete story that wraps up in 26 episodes, but not this one. The dub is horrible, there are times where characters mouths move with no words like an old foreign film. The animation for the demons is crap. Nothing in the story is explained. I just sat through 10 hours and wasted $70 on this half baked show to tell you to go elsewhere. If you want blood and action, go watch hellsing ultimate. If you want the story of war and brothers fighting on opposite sides, watch code geass. This is the show for people who thought Guilty Crown was the best thing on earth, and even that story was better than this cash grab.",1483315200,,635,4.3

8751549,2,B01BUQ72H6,"Just weird. So many obvious boy-love themes. I have no interest in that and having the main hero being called ""princess"" by the other dude was just weirder then anything iv seen on mainstream shonens. Ruined a great rage moment in ep 12. It annoys me to no end when people play this down and make the people who question this feel like idiots and homophobes for pointing out the obvious. I remember researching this and everyone was like  ""its no more boy-love then naruto"". Yeah freaken right! Nowhere it lists this either. $45 bucks to watch a dude cry about another dude, while making zero attempts to actually explain anything going on. Go watch hellsing ultimate or Blood Blockade battlefront. Vampires done right there",1473811200,6,724,4.792
