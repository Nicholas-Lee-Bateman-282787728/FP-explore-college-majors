2154309,3,B0002ZYDZQ,"Very disapointing.  I found the DVD of the calendar shoot interesting only through the eyes of a photographer.  Other than this, i found the dvd to be long and dry.  the calendar may be erotic, but the DVD, not at all.",1142812800,3,218,4.2682926829268295
2154310,3,B0002ZYDZQ,"Yes, all these men are beautiful, but unless you're happy with torsos & butts with maybe 3 (yes 3!) ""Full Monty"" shots (that you'll need to pause to really see) you may be disappointed.  That's full frontal shots of 3 models TOTAL not 48!  95% of the time there's a hand, sock, knee, table, another model, etc. blocking the view.

The videographer seemed somewhat intent on showing us the good stuff and the editor seemed determined that (at the last second) he wouldn't, over and over again, then BAMM! a fattie shows up.  It would be a bit of an exaggeration to call these the ""Swinging Bratwurst"" shots, but still they were nice.

The models often seemed uncomfortable with their nudity.  Maybe it was having the video camera constantly leering about.  Some of the poses are very provocative.  I can't imagine the NFL putting out something like this.

The 2005 version is nicer, in color, but has maybe 4 shots where they escargot all the way (full-frontal).  The 2006 version is apparently even more disappointing than either 2004 or 2005.  If you find Greenwood/Cooper films dull (and really, who doesn't), you may wish to think twice about this purchase.",1136764800,20,1160,4.778894472361809
2154311,5,B0002ZYDZQ,"This DVD is obviously homoerotic, tasteful, artistic, and reveals the comfort level these men have regarding their sexuality and nudity.  This comes recommended for anyone who is interested in the perfection of the male form.",1123459200,11,225,5.428571428571429
2154312,4,B0002ZYDZQ,"This documentary was shot while photographer Francois Rousseau was photographing 46 beautiful nude young athletic Frenchmen for a 2004 calendar. The calendar sold 1 million copies.

The documentary is all in French and is not subtitled. It is filmed in black and white, which actually heightens the contracts between light and dark and shows the male body in the most flattering light.

The documentary focuses on the models rather than the photograhpers and support staff. I guess this is the whole point, but while watching it you wonder what the make-up artists, the hairdressers, the lighting technicians were thinking. Some of the young men were obviously heterosexual whereas a few shots had homoerotic tension during the photography, but not overt sexual play takes place. The most interesting thing to me was how relaxed these nude men were around 6 or 8 photography staff.

This 140 minute DVD is a tribute to young male athletic beauty. That is all you get, nothing more.",1108944000,33,981,5.04320987654321
2154313,5,B0002ZYDZQ,"This is one of the sexiest, most erotic dvd's I have come across.  It is an import from France and it's great to see the playfulness and sexy interaction between these french atheletes.  A definite must have!",1101254400,9,208,4.594594594594595
8035418,5,B0002ZYDZQ,"My wife asked me to buy this for her as a birthday present.  She is now in love with the rugby stars (gods) Carroll, Segoire, Deltour, James, and Cermeno.  She has no use for me any more.  These men are works of art.  They are sheer physical perfection.  Who can blame her?
I will be careful that my girlfriend never sees this film.  She still thinks I am adorable.  My girlfriend is young and pretty, my beloved wife is plump and middle aged, so overall it is a good outcome for me.
The music is perfect, the presentation is tasteful and artistic.  I believe that if Michelangelo Buonarrati and Leonardo DaVinci were alive to day they would be doing artistic work exactly like this film.",1379894400,,688,4.448
8035419,5,B0002ZYDZQ,"This DVD is testament to the fact that French men are not known around the world as a good-looking lot, for no reason. This film is tastefully done,so if you are looking for porn,forget it. Black & white photography,good production values and lighting all combine to show these men looking their best.  The highlight for me was the stunning Frederic Deltour, who won the title of Mr France 2003. No surprise there. Other greats are Bastien Siepielski, James Carroll, and Mirco Birgamasco.

If you bought the calendar this behind the scenes look would be of interest to you. Even if you didn't get the calendar, buy this.",1255564800,,620,4.785046728971962

8035422,5,B0002ZYDZQ,"These are young athletes who have been sharing locker rooms and showers for years. They know they are beautiful and that people like them. However, they are not porn actors. Their bodies and faces are chiseled by gifts of nature, and a lot of sacrifices (extensive trainings, missed parties, and periods without sex). They are not porn actors that pump themselves in the gym just for the pleasure of making easy money, and often going against their real nature for this purpose.

This video is high-quality. The guys are beautiful and sensual. There is domain for erotic fantasy -- fantasy, I say. You will never be able to see enough, and you will never be able to know what is going on behind the curtains. If you like beauty, harmony, and aesthetic, then this is video is really worth a lot. If you are looking for erotic action, then probaly you should consider browsing somewhere else.....",1179446400,5,894,4.730769230769231
8035423,2,B0002ZYDZQ,"Erotic quality is there and the models are willing to show it off. Sadly for several reasons most of the ""making of"" is sensored to show almost no [...]. The models are obviously not embarrassed or shy and more than willing, on the contrary it is the producers/directors/editors that wanted to keep things G rated. I didn't expect [...] or sexual content, but I certainly didn't expect the film to stop when the pubic hair started. Judging from the BOOK, there was more [...] to be seen as it is a very important part of the male body and absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I do understand these are real people but I can't believe they are all prudes.",1177459200,4,654,4.458333333333333
