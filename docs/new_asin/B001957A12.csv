3422617,5,B001957A12,"There just isn't anything better than a good ole belly laugh. You know the kind. The ones that makes your insides hurt, pop come squirting out your nose and maybe other places that you hadn't planned on.

I usually resort to regular comedy.  But then you have to either get a filter to weed out all the profanity, or just deal with it.

The problem with getting a filter to get rid of all the bad language is that most regular stand up comedy is so filled with profanity that you are left with 1 word out of 10. It's hard to find a joke funny when all you hear are bleeps.

I love Comedy, but good Christian comedy has always been a challenge. In fact, it is almost an oxymoron. If the comedy does not have the name of Jesus in every other word, it just wasn't considered Christian. I don't know about you, but I call that a sermon, not comedy.

This flawed thinking, I'm happy to say, has been overcome by ""The Apostles of Comedy.""

When I heard about this video, I was very apprehensive, to say the least. If it had not been for the fact that it came recommended by a very good friend of mine, (Shameless Plug here....Eric Wilson writer of Fireproof the book, and Field of Blood among others .) I would not have taken the chance. I have been burned too many times by Christian comedy that was supposed to be good, but turned out to be like watching paint dry or worse.

Even as I was putting the DVD in my DVD payer, I was expecting it to be a flop. Boy was I was surprised! In fact, my wife and I laughed harder than we had in a long time. This comedy is relevant to our current times, fresh, clean and just plain funny.

I think one of the strongest reasons for the success of this Comedy Dynamic Duo is their diversity. Each comic brings something completely different to the stage. After each one completed his bit, I expected to see that giant foot come down and hear those words again ""And now for something completely different.""

My personal favorite was Anthony Griffith. One of his best jokes, at least to me, was one that poked fun at the Church and Church goers. It seems that his mom was well adept at signing hymns, while at the same time, administering punishment to Anthony, who was at the time, a small boy. (This joke sounded much better in my head and on the DVD.)

Anthony's stand up was largely about real aspects of life growing up in the south side of Chicago. He reminded he a little of Bill Cosby, which up until this point, was my favorite comedian.

Next up was Brad Stein. Now Brad does not look like the stereotypical Christian Comedian at all. You know the ones I'm talking about. They look like they just swallowed a Bible, and come dressed in 2 or 3 piece suits.

Brad does not fit this at all. He looks like a Red Neck or perhaps a Red Neck Hippie, or a Red Neck Hippie Mountain Man. I expected Jeff Foxworthy to come join him on stage. Together, they would go off on those famous Red Neck jokes. He was certainly the most unique of the 4. And his humor, well...you just need to hear it for yourself. It's among the best I have ever heard, Christian or not.

Then there is Ron Pearson. Ron's humor spanned from the Church to family to education. I thought the parts about our educational system were very funny. However, I have to take a little bit of an exception to them. Ron is poking fun at the fact that what we learned in school is of no value in real life. In my opinion, this is sending a bad message to kids. Perhaps I'm overreacting. After all, the very nature of stand up, is to poke fun at things.

Last, but in no ways least, there is Jeff Allen. His humor is largely about his home life with his Wife and Son. One of his main catch phrases is ""happy wife, happy life."" Allen has a DVD by this name as well. There is a wonderful review of this DVD written by Richard Lanoie.

Allen has a smile that is reminiscent of a Looney Tunes or Warner Brothers character. (My favorite was Bugs Bunny, which is Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers used to have those wonderful stores, until they were taken over by AOL, and Time Warner, which bagged em.) Even if for some odd reason Allen's comedy does not make you laugh; an odd reason like, maybe you're dead, his smile will do the trick.

My only real criticism of the DVD pertains to how it was put together. The appearance by each to the comedians was broken down into very short segments of just a few minutes. After each segment, we were taken to a clip of behind the scenes footage. This footage consisted of get togethers of the 4 comedians and some family life. My wife and I tried to watch a little of this, but we got bored, so we found ourselves fast forwarding through them.

After this footage, instead of going back to the original comic, which had been disrupted somewhere in the middle of their routine, we were taken to a different comic. So the film flow went something like this; Jeff, then Brad, then Anthony, then Ron, then back to Brad, then Anthony....well, you get the picture.

I would be just starting to really get into one of the comedians routines, when suddenly it was over. I would have much preferred to have seen each comic's routine in its entirety before moving on to the next one.

Bottom line. If you want a good belly laugh, and you don't like cursing every other word, then this video is for you. It doesn't really matter even if you're not Christian cause, these guys are not out to shove the Bible down your throat. However, this would certainly be a wonderful video to send to you unsaved friends.

After all, if they are unsaved, they need a good laugh.",1237852800,5,5581,4.307251908396947
3422618,4,B001957A12,"This comedy DVD has lots of great humor.  There is no shortage of laughing while viewing this one.

It features two comedians with whom I was already familiar (Brad Stine and Jeff Allen) and two that are new to me (Anthony Griffith and Ron Pearson).  Each has a different style, but all are extremely good.  This is a comedy show that one can comfortably watch with the whole family.  There is no foul language or off color humor.  These comics demonstrate that great comedy need not be crude.

The only reason that I rated it with four stars rather than five is that there is a lot of non comedy time on this disc.  It contains interviews and other commentary.  Although there is nothing wrong with that, it is not quite what I was expecting.  Nevertheless, it is a great time.  I recommend it.",1236816000,4,795,4.451388888888889
3422619,4,B001957A12,"Let's face it. Christian comedy is often inferior in quality of delivery and production, and the need to appeal to a conservative audience lends itself to tacked-on sermonettes that feel forced and...well, un-funny. Regardless, I decided to give this DVD a chance after a recommendation from a friend.

What a kick in the pants! Anthony Griffith is a soft-spoken comic, with routines that deal with growing up and life, delivered in an understated manner that had me in stitches. Jeff Allen has a Munster-like appearance and delivery that won me over more slowly, yet had me laughing out loud as he related real-life situations of parenting and marriage. Ron Pearson's honesty about modern worship, education, and teachers had me busting up despite myself. While Brad Stine's style is more abrasive, over the top--and for me, sometimes a bit fundamentalist to the point of distraction--he, too, had some funny observations about political correctness.

All of these men have resumes that include network TV, Jay Leno and Letterman, the Comedy Channel and so on. Their professionalism is evident. My only real complaint is that the routines were broken up by chat sessions with the men and their wives. These sessions were enjoyable, even poignant, but could've been done as a separate feature that didn't break up the laughter. All in all, this is the best DVD of Christian comedy I've seen, and had me laughing as much as I do at some of my favorite comedians on TV.",1231718400,14,1467,4.959349593495935

3422621,1,B001957A12,"This was disappointing.  We got this as a gift, assuming it would be like ""Bill Cosby"" clean comedy with Christian themes.  The DVD is about 1/2 interview/commentary, and 1/2 staged comedy.  Except for the ending statement about the comedy being intended to encourage the (Christian) audience, the little encouragement in it came primarily from the struggles shared during the interviews.  Although much of Brad Stine's material could have been funny, his fire&brimstone yelling-preacher delivery conveys his apparent ignorance.  I also found Brad's (and his wife's) goal for him to be immortalized a bit vain.  The team in general had mostly funny material, though where's the creativity in constantly degrading family members, church groups, or other people-groups ?  Ron Pearson's material seemed the most creative, and was very well delivered.  Jeff Allen and Tony Griffith also had some good material and good delivery.",1231113600,7,924,5.457746478873239

Its really smart stand up comedy that you CAN watch with the whole family. I think that's the most amazing part of it for me - that these are really high quality comedians (they really should be up there with the best) - but they poke fun at stuff that is safe (There are absolutely no jokes about sex, drugs, drinking etc.) Your kids can watch this - its one of the few examples of stand up comedy that the whole family can watch.

3422725,4,B001957A12,"""Apostles Of Comedy"" dvd centers involves 4 comedians and respective themes:

1.  Jeff Allen - relationship with his wife and son.
2.  Brad Stine - various social issues and political correctness.
3.  Anthony Griffith - lessons learned while growing up in Detroit.
4.  Ron Pearson - mainly about family life.

While most of the dvd shows the different comedians on stage, there are scenes when the comedians are off stage and discussing the various struggles they have faced:  losing a child, health, financial, career, etc.

In my humble opinion, the dvd is extremely funny and proves that you do not have to be profane or dirty to be funny.

The dvd is little more than 1.5 hours but the time quickly goes by.

Highly recommended for good, clean, wholesome entertainment.

3422760,2,B001957A12,"This is a mixed bag, as you'd expect with a dvd that features four comedians.

Jeff Allen puts in a great performance with outstanding content and delivery. Whilst not being revolutionary, his material is very warm and I would recommend his act to people of all ages and creeds. 4 stars.

Similarly, Anthony Griffith has a great, understated style, making him the most instantly likable comedian, imho. Like Allen, the material is of a fairly standard fare, appealing to a wide audience e.g. childhood, relationships etc. 4 stars.

Ron Pearson has obvious talent for comedy but I find that his material doesn't quite work. It's far from the worst Christian comedian I've ever seen, but it seems to lack the authenticity of the aforementioned performers. As I said, he's a funny guy but I think he can alter his routine a little to come up with something that is more well rounded. 3 stars.

Brad Stine is an awful impersonation of Dennis Leary (who is himself an awful impersonation of the wonderful, Bill Hicks - which isn't to say Hicks is the start of that routine, by any stretch, but just that there's a clear lineage between these comedians). He is incredibly grating and I find that the 'angry man telling the truth' only works when the chutzpah is met with logic and accuracy. Stine fails at this and his act comes off as bitter and unnecessarily divisive. Not only would his material only appeal to Christians, but it would take a specific kind of Christian who is not only conservative but also relatively close-minded and mean-spirited, in order to cheer along with this buffoon. Whilst his material does not contain blue language, it is so vitriolic that I'd question whether it's really 'family friendly' or sufficiently aligned with Christian values. 1 star.

So, as I said at the outset, it is a mixed bag. Interspersed with the routines is documentary footage that provides an insight into these comedians. The first three come across as very likable gentlemen whilst Stine seems to, unfortunately, resemble his on-stage persona.

I would recommend this dvd, with some reluctance, and would suggest perhaps searching out the work of these comedians, individually, to see what works for you, and take it from there.",1266883200,6,2230,4.886243386243386

3422764,5,B001957A12,"I asked my wife if she would get me this for my birthday, and she did. The truth was, she wanted to see this just as much as I did. We wanted to see this because we've seen 3 out of the 4 comedians featured on this DVD, and we wanted to see more. The result? The 3 comedians we have seen, Brad Stine, Jeff Allen, and Ron Pearson, I gained a whole new level of respect for each of them! And while this was my first experience watching Anthony Griffith, I certainly hope I get more chances to see this guy.

There were 4 comedians featured in this treat. And I will comment on all of them, THEN give suggestions on 3 of them.

Brad Stine was the comedian we knew best out of all of these guys. When it came to buying comedy DVD's, PUT A HELMET ON was among the first. And this man's loyalty to his country, combined with a love for Jesus Christ makes him a force to be reckoned with when he's on stage! He packs an aggressive punch, and is zealous about what he believes. He is always welcome in my home. NOW FOR MY SUGGESTIONS...Brad Stine has at least 4 DVDs out, (hopefully a lot more in the future) at least as far as I know, and I'll list them all. PUT A HELMET ON!!! This is a trademark for Brad, and it was his debut DVD. We've stuck with Brad ever since. A CONSERVATIVE UNLEASHED is #2, TOLERATE THIS!! is his 3rd DVD, and last year he came out with WUSSIFICATION. I recommend ALL of these. You'll find that I recommend EVERYTHING I list that comes with this review, so be aware!

Jeff Allen is another great comedian who brings reality from his own home to the stage. If it weren't for the ministry of BANANA'S Comedy, I believe I would've missed out. Jeff Allen sometimes reminds me of my own dad, with a great comedic twist. He's not afraid to use the word BOY, in reference to his son, and brings a great sense of humor that is hard to ignore! I have his BANANAS DVD's, he has 2 out, and I recommend both of them. And I can't wait to get his other 2 DVDs, HAPPY WIFE, HAPPY LIFE, and MY HEART, MY COMEDY. I love this guy, and I feel like I've known him all my life!! Can't wait to finish my collection with this guy!

Ron Pearson brings EVERYTHING to the table. An explosive sense of humor, along with a hilarious look at our education system, it's hard not to like this guy. Now aside from this DVD, here's what you are missing... Ron Pearson, like Jeff Allen, happens to be featured on BANANAS. And let me tell you, watch the extended performance of Ron on DVD, and you are in for a treat. In the BANANAS DVD he offers juggling, along with other treats as well. This is a man you don't want to miss!!

Anthony Griffith was the one I'd had yet to see. And I was pleasantly surprised when I finally did get to see him. Soft spoken, he always keeps the audience and viewer on the toes. He really made me laugh, especially his bit about Mama singing a hymn while pulling out the belt to whup his butt at the same time. Anthony Griffith also has MS, and he is an amazing man. Now, aside from this DVD, I have nothing else of this man, and I wish I did. This guy is hilarious, and I'd buy his stuff in a heartbeat.

Along with great comedy, you get some great testimony from each of these men. They all love The Lord, and they all show a witness that a Christian should envy!

My suggestion (along with the others I've given) is to get this DVD. I loved it, and gained a whole new level of respect for each of these warriors!! Worth every penny, and that's saying something these days.",1242691200,,3491,4.140117994100295

These are four very talented men, each with a different style so if one does not appeal as much to you, one of the others likely will.  Well worth the investment.  Appropriate for family viewing.  Kudos for making this DVD available.",1239408000,,314,4.362068965517241
