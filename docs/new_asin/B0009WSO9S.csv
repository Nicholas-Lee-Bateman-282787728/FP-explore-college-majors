8068778,5,B0009WSO9S,Excellent DVD and service.,1424822400,,26,5.75
8068779,2,B0009WSO9S,"The video is simply not instructional. He is simply playing licks and chords so quickly you have no time to form the notes in your head yourself. He doesn't start at the beginning, simply indicating with slowness and methodology what and how he is playing these licks. That leaves the owner of this video very frustrated; I simply have no use for this product in the form that its currently in. Vassar seems to take more pleasure in playing for his audience these quick licks than he has in bringing it to light for his less experienced listeners.

Very displeased indeed....",1388707200,2,575,4.693069306930693
8068780,4,B0009WSO9S,"What a great way to learn from a master. This DVD was filmed in a casual conversational manner. It's like sitting in on a chat between two musicians. Vassar learned fiddle like players of decades past...by listening. Here's a great opportunity to listen and emulate. Though the DVD comes with sheet music resist the temptation to use it. Tune your ears and watch the fingerboard, you'll be glad you did.",1246060800,2,403,4.771428571428571
