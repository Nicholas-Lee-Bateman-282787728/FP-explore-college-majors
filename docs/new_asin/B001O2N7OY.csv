Each time I listened, I learned something new.  They are awesome.  So when I saw that Chip had a DVD, I was both curious and elated.
I sat down to watch the DVD and about 5 minutes into Chip's presentation I had to push the pause button so I could run and get my notepad, as I knew I was going to need to take some notes.  I'm glad I did!
Chip is an awesome presenter communicating timeless truths with passion and packages them with a great deal of humor.  I found myself laughing along with the audience.  Best of all, I learned some things and was reminded of things.  I loved the DVD and I highly recommend it to all.",1238025600,,785,4.315068493150685
