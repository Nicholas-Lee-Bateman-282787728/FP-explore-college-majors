4572238,3,B00555ZTGU,"You would certainly be excused if somehow Disco Worms came and went without making so much as a blip on your computer generated film radar.  Like many CG feature films available on Blu & DVD these days, this one makes use of the international approach: namely it begins life as a fairly large release in its native country (in this case Denmark followed by Germany) then gets imported to the States & redubbed with a domestic vocal cast, then receives a pretty modest direct-to-video release.  In fact from there it's pretty much relegated to discount DVD bins at your local shopping center, the Netflix catalog, the $1 rental territory of the Redbox.

For the record- the international CG film route has, to date, never amounted to much.  And it shouldn't be too surprising.  When you look at a Pixar film or a DreamWorks piece, a good portion of the success comes from the sheer cleverness of the plot. Whether confirming our suspicions that our toys really had minds of their own or teaching us that the reason monsters scare is that they collect the energy within human screams to power their city; the common thread is a noteworthy prose that just so happens to share the common medium of computer generated imagery.

If the cleverness of the plot itself isn't enough to keep you entertained, solid acting and humor should fill in the gaps. The visual gags may have the attention of the little ones but it's the pop culture references and the layered wit that keeps adults enthralled.  Because of this, most foreign-turned-domestic CG movies fail.  They either lack the initial cleverness, fail to connect with social reference or drop the ball on acting/ delivery (since matching mouth flaps to sync up with another language pretty much destroys any chance of decent dialog).  The worst examples of the genre (Dolphin The Story of a Dreamer or Doogal to mention a few) are actually guilty of all three crimes.

All of this ranting brings us to Disco Worms, the 2008 film originally titled Sunshine Barry & The Disco Worms.  Believe it or not, an argument could be made that this is one of the stronger indie CG films on the market.

As far as cleverness goes- the concept of talking worms isn't too bad.  A Bug's Life, Antz, the Bee Movie and a few others have proven there's lots of room in the marketplace for some personified insects doing what they do. In this case the lowly earthworm is given an opportunity to exhibit the fact that being the bottom of the food chain is no picnic and getting no respect, even from creatures as insignificant as the mosquito, is equally troubling.

To make matters worse, our protagonists happen to be worms reaching the age where it's time to move out of their parents' homes and get jobs at the local compost factory.  Logically one might expect working worms to do such tasks as tunneling, hauling dirt or something to that effect; apparently here compost duty involves wearing a small shirt, tie & sports coat and stapling forms to leafs.  A spoof on office-life undoubtedly, even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  I think the moral you're supposed to take from this is that worms have no chance for advancement even in such working conditions as the bosses happen to all be insects.

Fortunately, just as all hope looks lost... In this case Barry taking a job at the compost factory like the rest of the worms in the neighborhood, a long forgotten disco record resurfaces and forever changes Barry's destiny.

If this sounds a little weak on plot to you, rest assured, it is in action as well.  However the gimmicks of revisiting the disco era provide ample opportunities for humorous clich&eacute;s: afro wigs, disco balls, funky guitar licks, they're all here.  And speaking of, the soundtrack is surprisingly tight.  Dancehall classics like Disco Inferno, the Villiage People even some Michael Jackson make the grade.

Pacing moves along quickly if plotted quite predictably.  With a 75-minute runtime, scenes rarely drag on unnecessarily and believe it or not, some of the jokes actually hold up surprisingly well.  Others fair less favorably; like some metal references and a little inappropriate language earning the PG rating.

The dialog does flow better than it has any right to, all factors considering.  Mouth flaps are right on and the comedic/ conversational timing is decent as well.

In all viewers going in expecting legit Pixar or DreamWorks competition are going to be disappointed with the linear plot structure and fairly simplistic nature of the material but little ones will likely be entertained and adults should be able to find a bit to enjoy as well.  All this one really lacks is a bit of cleverness; a good reason for disco to resurface to tie it all together.  For example, how is it earthworms came upon a record of human disco tunes anyway? Were the original songs supposed to be ours or were there little earthworm equivalents making the same songs/ cutting records back in the 70s? Nitpicking? Maybe.  But it's the small attention to details that separate the great films from the mediocre ones.  This one manages to avoid most of the pitfalls however and is certainly worth a rental when the kids have gotten tired of everything else in the Redbox.",1342915200,7,5240,4.7877777777777775
4572239,5,B00555ZTGU,"Of course it's a kid's movie and you may be able to predict what is going to happen. However, it is so adorable. C'mon singing and dancing worms that use their tail to make up for their lack of hands and feet to mimic some of the most popular moves of the disco era. The Village People transformed into warms...hilarious. I'm 21 years old, but watched it with my younger siblings and thoroughly enjoyed the film. There's the theme of the underdog, love, determination, never giving up on your dreams, and true friendship. After watching this movie you will never find your children dissecting a worm with a twig in your backyard again.",1342656000,,635,4.628318584070796

4572246,5,B00555ZTGU,"I love this movie! I originally came across it on Netflix, but now I must have it for my very own. It's the story of a young man (worm) struggling to find his way in the world, when his way is off the beaten path (his way is actually the path with a beat!) This movie will only appeal to viewers with a great sense of humor and terrific rhythm. Boogie down!",1453420800,,357,3.9722222222222223
4572247,5,B00555ZTGU,"I purchased this film about a month ago from the bargain bin at Walmart and little did I know that viewing it would change my life. I view this dazzling film every night to reflect on my day and put me in the right frame of mind to greet the morning sunshine that is ahead of me. Everything about this fine film is remarkable. The brilliant costume design, animation, passionate romance, darn fine voice acting, clever intricate plot and cheerful upbeat tone really brightens my day. If it wasn't for this film I don't know what I would do because the pills my mom gives me aren't working anymore and this film is the only thing that prevents me from throwing a noose around my neck and calling it a day!

I strongly relate to the titular character Barry as I also work in a dead-end office job and have a disco band. Perhaps I also need to assemble a tough rag-tag group of worm friends and we'll really be on our way to getting that record contract. I think there is a strong message in this film and it is to be yourself and more importantly to boogie. If everyone boogied to disco, the world would be a better place and there wouldn't be war. I also think that the notion of unapoligetically being yourself is clearly there. So what if i like to hang with worm friends, listen to disco and am a strong independent black woman who don't need no man. I'm bold and beautiful and this little motion picture helped me realize that life is precious and God and the Bible too.

Gather your family and friends, make some disco gummy worm dirt cake, pop this DVD in the video player and strap in and prepare for the best night of your life! Listen to disco, watch worm movies and get down wit ya bad self.
God bless ya'll

4572248,1,B00555ZTGU,My daughter and her friend love this movie for some reason..probably because it's great in it's awefulness. It's not that there is anything actually wrong with it..but it just isn't the quality you get from top animation these days and the storyline is kinds lame. The music while of the disco era is limited and also kinda lame. If you noticed I used the word lame a few times. That is the best description of this film.,1420848000,,421,4.48051948051948

8457535,3,B00555ZTGU,"For an animated kid's movie, ""Disco Worms"" is certainly one of the more unique in recent memory, and being different is good. Not ironically, that's one of the themes of the film as well, as it's a story of outsiders trying to fit in. Should Barry, the young worm pursue his dream of being a disco star or follow his father's fate and work in a compost factory? Along the way there are plenty of ups and downs, most of them easily predictable to adults, but which children (who aren't grossed out by worms) will likely enjoy.

There is an obligatory love story with the beautiful blonde worm Gloria (Jane Lynch, the one modestly big name attached to the project) and Barry struggling to hit it off. The characters put their hearts into their disco band and endure lots of challenges that bring them closer together (the ""live bait"" scene being particularly noteworthy) and enter a contest promising a reward of $10,000 and fame. I won't reveal how that works out except to say it's touch and go until the very end.

I thought the subplot about Gloria being utterly unable to sing (though mysteriously that's overcome in the big finale) worked well and the music was priceless. I mean just ponder cartoon worms performing ""Boogie Wonderland"", ""Disco Inferno"", ""Upside Down"", I Will Survive"", and ""Play That Funky Music"" in the climactic showstopper. It's so incongruous that I have to give the movie three stars simply for the surrealistic blending of worms and disco. It's not the greatest movie I have ever seen and while there are incongruities and holes in the plot, it will likely distract most young children although it may have the side effect of provoking them to sing disco hits incessantly.",1473552000,4,1700,4.759322033898305
