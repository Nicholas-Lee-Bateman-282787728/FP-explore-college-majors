What I got was a 30 minute DVD with badly edited ,or I should say,hacked to pieces songs. The audio on the CD is quite disappointing. Not worth the money they're asking.",1463616000,4,277,4.56

Glad this has been released legit,so I can finally throw out those awful-quality boots Ive had all these years! Must-have for all Rainbow fans!!!

7682686,5,B01CEWRASG,"Here is an update to the Rainbow - 'Monsters Of Rock' Live at Donington 1980 cd/dvd released April 22nd, 2016.

Firstly the complete show on audio does NOT exist at present. Two tracks still remain missing to this day...

'Love's No Friend' and 'The Man On The Silver Mountain'

The European release has all the other tracks bar two. 'Pomp & Circumstance' and 'Kill The King'/'Guitar Smash'/'Long Live Rock N' Roll' (reprise). This is 1 cd.

The Japanese release comes as a 2 cd set....and includes the last two tracks....and has everything that is available.

Both the European release and the Japanese release has the 30 minute DVD highlights in pristine condition.

The sound in the audio cd is exceptional and fantastic quality ..considering it's over 35 years old. As I write this The Official Ritchie Blackmore Facebook page is reporting that this release is #5 in the UK charts. Not bad considering it has been on the charts 3 weeks now!

As for the video of the COMPLETE concert ..it doesn't exist any longer unfortunately.
It is either lost ...or has been wiped!

In saying that ..many thought the audio was lost until recently ...so.........

7682687,4,B01CEWRASG,Killer release by Rainbow pretty good quality and a fantastic set list on both the Cd and Dvd,1462492800,,93,4.222222222222222
7682688,4,B01CEWRASG,"I love it, but I've been a huge Blackmore fan for 40+ years.

I listened to the CD first. I am sure I will be listening to this over and over for the next few months, though the sound is only acceptable. By that, I mean it's kind of noisy.

As a fan, I really liked the DVD too, but it doesn't quite meet expectations. There are times, for example, when you see somebody singing, but don't hear a corresponding vocal. Also, even though less songs are listed than for the CD, even that is exaggerated. Some of the songs listed are only played as brief parts of a medley.

Overall, it's great for a true fan, since there is so little out there for the Graham Bonnet lineup, but this isn't what I would buy for someone who only had 3 Blackmore CDs. It's a shame, too, because if this had the same duration and quality of the 1995 Doogie White-fronted DVD (though on the first song on that one, you can actually hear people talking), it might be my favorite Rainbow DVD.",1462320000,,966,4.239130434782608
7682689,2,B01CEWRASG,"I was excited to see this coming out, I have owned the Catslt Donnington Sampler LP since it cam eout. I was not expecting much from the DVD and it was awesome to witness the Glory of Rainbow and get a glimpse of the tour I saw in Seattle.
Well, the music on the DVD is stellar, the playing and it sounds like the band is enjoying themselves but the sound quality sounds horrid, especially when turned up. When comparing this with the new Bad Company live release of the two 70's shows and sonically the sound is superior.
Makes you wonder if they even mixed the tapes",1462320000,,568,4.268518518518518
7682690,3,B01CEWRASG,"I knew this was coming out...knew the DVD portion was not the complete show so I thought OK still worth the shot.  While the concert itself is pretty good (audio CD anways) the DVD is a let down.  I mean it is only around 25 minutes and NO bonus nothing.  You'd think in this day and age at least an interview of some participating members looking back or something!  So lets begin, the audio CD represents the entire show I believe.  The band start out strong.  Eyes of the World, Since You Been Gone show just how strong the band are live and how good Down to Earth album is.  Graham is in full force on Stargazer and Catch the Rainbow.  He does an excellent job, and easily has the pipes to match Dio's gusto given to those songs.  Lost in Hollywood is next, again strong performance, leading to the groups virtuoso skills.  Keyboards, guitar and drum solos all intertwined with Difficult to Cure being played somewhere all the way, with Lazy being noodled out by Blackmore and the band.  Graham returns for All Night Long, and vocally it sounds like he is loosing steam.  Solid performance but again another jam segment for Blues.  Will You Still Love Me is next, and Graham belts it out, leading to LLRNR, which to me is unspectacular really.  Graham goes gonzo along with way and it just loses interest.  All together a solid concert, definitely listenable repeatable on CD...the DVD however not so much.  What erks me is the $20.00 price on this set.  Definitely not worth that much.",1461888000,20,1490,4.541353383458647
7682691,3,B01CEWRASG,"Having been a Blackmore fan since the early 70s and having only heard the two tracks available on the original Monsters of Rock LP I couldn't wait to order this DVD/CD set. To say I was disappointed would be the understatement of the year. Mind you I have only watched the DVD so I can only hope the CD is better. The editing is atrocious...bits and pieces of songs chopped together, tracks out of sequence, tracks listed on the jacket but not even played. Im not sure if even one song is played in its entirety. The only thing the editor got right was cutting Bonnet's ridiculous whistling on ""All Night Long"". As for the audio and video quality, they are about what you would expect from a 1980 concert however they still could have been  better. All in all it gives a glimpse of what could have been had Blackmore not decided to go top 40. Bonnet's vocals though not in the same league as Dio are head and shoulders above Joe Lynn Turner's. Maybe someday Blackmore will put out the entire show on DVD..we can only hope.",1461801600,12,1022,4.407407407407407
7682692,3,B01CEWRASG,"I am a little disappointed in this one.  I bought it mostly for the DVD and thought there would be more there, but it really is a lot of abbreviated songs.  Total running time for the DVD portion is 30 minutes, and it really felt shorter than that.  I would still recommend any Rainbow fan should get this, just know that there isn't much to the DVD.",1461369600,17,350,4.1940298507462686
7682693,5,B01CEWRASG,"Look, this ""review"" was written over a month before this set even comes out so of course I don't own it........YET! I was stationed in Germany in the early 80's and this concert was available on an LP which I bought because I am a Blackmore fanatic. OMG, this concert is stunning. Graham shines on vocals and Cozy, well Cozy will always be Cozy. Roger and Don added the right stuff to Blackmore to make it even better than ""Made in Japan"" or ""In Concert."" But Blackmore shreds his solos like a man possessed. Catch the Rainbow is beyond words and will leave you gasping for air while Stargazer is the ultimate guitar solo of all time, and THE NOTE at 4:57 minutes is beyond epic. Over and over I listed to that until the record was stolen.

I was able to find some knockoff on Ebay that just sounded horrible a few years ago but never anything to compare to the German album I had. I have been looking forward to this for decades and it is finally time to CATCH THE RAINBOW!!!!!!

I received this set today and all I can say is ""THE NOTE"" has ARRIVED!!!!! Is it the complete show? no, is the sound quality matching the album I had all those years ago? BETTER!  The CD is incredible and the sound is pure heaven. Stargazer and Catch the Rainbow are mind blowing experiences that will forever thunder through my speaker system, only now they sound killer. The DVD is good thought I could not get the song select screen to work. The major deal is that this picture does not look like Frosty the Snowman being hit by a train going 80 mph like the knockoff I bought  a few years ago on ebay. Weighed in the balance, I'll take a non-functioning song select to a blizzard anyday and feel like a total winner. Dudes, if you are a guitar buff or Rainbow follower or even a Purpleite, GET THIS SET!!!",1457481600,16,1790,4.318452380952381

7682695,3,B01CEWRASG,"This is an historic album in that it was Cozy Powell's and Graham Bonnet's last Rainbow performance. Bobby Rondinelli took over the drum throne and Joe Lynn Turner the Mic after this show. I give it a three only because the sound is not the best, nor the video. Actually, I think the two tracks my old ""Monsters of Rock"" LP are of better quality. However, the playing is great. It's too bad it is NOT a complete show. There are one or two songs that were played on the night that are missing. If you are a fan of Rainbow, this was an inspired performance, but don't expect DDD digital quality sound and video.",1473811200,3,609,4.304347826086956

7682697,3,B01CEWRASG,"RAINBOW LIVE DONINGTON 1980
It's Great that this Historic Rainbow concert is now officially released
which was previously a bootleg
this Donington concert only goes for 30mins and yet Rainbow headlined this festival
so i assume Rainbow played a 60mins set
so there's alot of tracks edited out for some reason you can tell when you play the dvd
the tracks have been edited, pretty pathetic i think, the dvd should have the full set
infact the CD soundtrack in this Jewelcase has the full concert 12 tracks
here the tracks that are not on the dvd Since you been Gone, Stargazer, Lost in Hollywood, Drum solo, Blues & Long live rock'n'roll
well Eagle vision has released it as DVD not Blu-ray
the picture quality is only Digital remaster which looks very Good but not excellent
in my opinion this concert should've been given a new HD transfer, not a Digital remaster-big difference in quality
if it was given new HD transfer the picture quality would look about 10/10 for sure
so i would rate the dvd quality about 6-7/10, still better quality than VHS bootleg
the sound quality is only 2.0 stereo mix which should've been a 5.1 master mix
originally released in 1:33:1 ratio but Eagle vision managed to re-fix that to make it fit any widescreen TV
so there's no black bars on either side of the screen
there's also new booklet included with new liner notes by Malcolm Dome
as i said Rainbow Headlined this Donington show so the concert would've been 60mins or longer for sure
for some crap reason Eagle vision only produced this edited 30mins set
pretty pathetic effort i think 2-3 stars for this DVD based on edited concert & only Digital remaster picture, not HD",1473120000,,1663,4.659863945578231

7682700,4,B01CEWRASG,"I have been a Blackmore fan since 1980 and this concert is something i have waited for a very long time. I have it as a bootleg with very poor sound and it was a relief when i heard that it was to be released officially. The concert is good and especially Catch the rainbow is something extra. What i don't understand is why they have cut Man on the silvermountain and Kill the king. Why?? Otherwise this is Blackmore at his peak and Graham Bonnet's voice is as good as Dio ever was. Enjoy!!

7682701,2,B01CEWRASG,"Yeah I know, I'm being fairly harsh here, and as a big Rainbow fan it pains me to say this, but.... look, I said it before and I'll say it again: you DON'T sit on a release for 30 some odd years and hope for the best, EVER! Chances are content is going to get ""sadly lost"".... as has been already discussed (here and elsewhere), this release lacks 2 full songs from the actual show, namely ""Love's No Friend"" and ""Man on the Silver Mountain"".... what has NOT been discussed up to now is that in addition to those 2 lost songs, this release chops off 10 additional minutes of the latter half of the show.... how do we know this? Because the Japanese edition of this very same CD is actually a 3-disc affair: 2 CD's, one DVD, and by making the comparison, some diligent DP/Rainbow fans picked up on that....

So what do we have here, really: a 30 minute, fairly useless DVD with poorly edited video content, and a heavily edited audio CD of the concert.... I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to pass on this....

I want to believe that the intention behind this release was finally to give the fans one of the most sought after items from the Rainbow catalog, and not simply put together a quick cash-in to benefit from the renewed interest in Rainbow/Ritchie, in light of the upcoming shows in Europe this year....

Anyway.... unless someone, somewhere miraculously comes up with a long lost copy of the master tapes and/or a decent soundboard tape of the show, I'm afraid this is the best we'll ever get.... too bad.... you've been warned....",1465257600,,1540,4.473309608540926

Cozy is on fire on the drums, with his solo 1812 Overture piece just nuts! There are a few improvisational passages on this recording that are about as sophisticated and rocking as anything they've ever done, making the full switch to a pop/metal band afterwards even more strange. Anyway, yeah, the video is short, but what is there is great. Certainly any Rainbow fan should have this. And certainly, Ritchie is never going to play like this again.",1508976000,,572,4.73

8752861,4,B01CEWRASG,"While what's included in the DVD is great audio/video speaking, I must state that the butchering of songs that were included is brutal.  Only the first verse of Eyes of the World is included before the disc cuts to Blackmore jamming in front of his amp with the band gone (i.e. No EofW soloing).  Only the last solo section of Catch the Rainbow is included, missing 80% of the entire song. Difficult To Cure, while it's listed, is not included, etc.  29 minutes is just way to short.  Also, last minor gripe is that what's there is out of sequence from the actual setlist played at that gig.",1497830400,,591,4.444444444444445
8752862,5,B01CEWRASG,"This review is for the 2x CD Import version of the Donnington 1980 concert. As an other reviewer pointed out on the US issue (CD + DVD) only the import version has all that is available: ........... The Japanese release comes as a 2 cd set....and includes the two missing tracks: ""Pomp & Circumstance"" on CD1 and ""Kill The King'/'Guitar Smash'/'Long Live Rock N' Roll' (reprise)"" on CD2.
I've had the Video of this performance in various forms over the years; VHS; Bootleg DVD; official release DVD (from ""Light in the Black"" Box set). Unfortunately the video of the show has remained untouched, semi bootleg quality that was originally shot by BBCTV, It is incomplete, but it is all that had survived over the years. Reading the reviews of the US release (CD+DVD) the DVD quality is the main source of the low ratings. Since I already own the video, I decided to fork out the extra $ and acquire the complete audio on 2 CD's. For me it was more than worth it! The audio quality is reasonably good, 8/10, I would say, like a very good soundboard recording, warts and all, it is not polished, but that is what gives it it's true value. It has a feel of a complete show, even though there are 2 tracks that were never released: the complete show on audio does NOT exist at present. Two tracks still remain missing to this day.. 'Love's No Friend' and 'The Man On The Silver Mountain'. It is a shame since it has become a legendary performance, we have to accept it THIS is all that is available. The two extra tracks available on this set provide a nice ""book-end"" to the performance, and the farewell to Cozy and Graham.",1493942400,,1619,4.472972972972973
