1535805,4,B00005JOD1,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I was seven years old at the time. I remember that I thought it was great movie. Of course, at that age, I had total suspension of disbelief. I wanted to have one of those capes that turns you invisible. I was also terrified by the dragon in ""The Singing Bone."" I was in real distress for the Buddy Hackett and Terry Thomas characters as they tried to avoid the dragon. The ending of that story made me sad.

I did see this movie once again on television as an adult. I laughed at how I had been totally affected by it as a seven-year-old.

I've signed up to be notified if and when this is released to DVD. I hope they do it justice when they do release it.",1195257600,4,699,4.0215827338129495
1535806,5,B00005JOD1,"This is a Wonderful Movie. It is excellent story telling. It is a treasure, showing a persons courage to hold on to a dream, and the struggle that he, his brother and his family go thru to keep that dream.unfortunately there is no swearing or sex or drugs, no nudity either, just a Good Story! What a concept!!!  It was one of 7 movies made in PanaVision, this is where 3 cameras are side by side filming a movie.",1146873600,6,413,4.227848101265823
1536007,2,B00005JOD1,"The Wonderful World Of The Brothers Grimm is a fantastic movie to watch, but has anyone found a good quality version of this in DVD format?
The DVD I have purchased appears to be video & audio extracted from a VHS tape, or something of the sort.
A point in the direction of a DVD with greater quality would be very much appreciated.",1380758400,2,332,4.285714285714286
1536008,4,B00005JOD1,"I was a fan of Cinerama from the very first time I walked into the theater and saw the size of the screen. In fact, I remember saying something about it at the time (10-years-old or thereabouts)around 1956. I had already seen CinemaScope, Todd-AO and Vista-Vision, but Cinerama really enthralled me. I went to the theater to see Cinerama every chance I got, which wasn't that often. Then, came the bad news. The Cinerama theater in downtown Minneapolis would no longer show Cinerama. They would revert to the old 70 mm. projections. Then, a year or so later, came the good news. Cinerama would be building a brand new theater for nothing but Cinerama out on Wayzata Boulevard. I couldn't wait to see it, and was impressed with the completely round building. Again, I was impressed with Cinerama, although this time I was considerably older. I still enjoyed the first movie shown there, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. Not knowing Cinerama was in its demise, only one more movie would be made using the three-strip process, I still was impressed with Cinerama at the new theater. In fact, the program notes for both Brothers Grimm and the subsequent picture How the West Was Won said this would be only the start of continuous Cinerama movies for years to come. HTW3 was the last in the three-strip process, however. Cinerama's name would continue to be used for another seven or eight years, but it was not the same. You did not have the same feeling of participation in the picture as you did with the old Cinerama. WWBG made full use of the process, especially in the fairy stories the Dancing Princess and the Singing Bone. The ride down the mountain in the old carriage was as good as any Cinerama thrill shot before, bringing back memories of the rollar coaster ride and the bobsled ride from earlier productions. HTW3 continued with several exciting action sequences built into the story. No other movie even came close. It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, the first movie without the three-strip still to be called Cinerama, tried hard, but failed miserably. Grand Prix, the racing picture, probably gave the best effort at it, and in fact was considered to be ahead of its time with the special effects photography.
I was therefore especially deligted when Flicker Alley decided to release the first Cinerama This is Cinerama and Windjammer to coincide with Cineram's 60th anniversary last year. While Windjammer wasn't exactly Cinerama, it was done in a similar process called Cinemiracle and it still had the quality of Cinerama. Both TIC and W were released on dvd in what they call the smilebox process which simulates the curved Cinerama screen and gives you some idea of how the process worked. The 5.1 stereo sound gives a pretty good idea of the seven-channel stereo sound, the first ever to be successful.  One would hope the other four pictures including WWBG would be released in this manner. I understand HTW3 is in smilebox on dvd, but I haven't seen it as yet. So, here's hoping we see more of these releases on dvd, especially including WWBG.",1361664000,5,3073,4.776315789473684
1536009,5,B00005JOD1,"This is one of the best fairy tales to hit the screen. And the original cast simply can not be replaced. I'm hoping that somehow with all of the tech we have, we will be able to release it to DVD for all generations to enjoy. It brings out the kid at heart. Simply timeless. Recently I found the movie on dvd, however the digital upgrade quality is lacking. Again, with all of the wonders of high-tech, one would think that someone would devote more to the enhancements of this timeless classic. Still I am grateful to have a copy that will outlast video.",1296259200,2,555,4.346153846153846
1536010,5,B00005JOD1,This was the first movie my mother and grandmother took me to see. I have never been to a indoors movie before. I enjoyed watching all the stories but the one who took my heart away was elves! I have the album that was sold from the movie. This is a keeper!,1257206400,,257,3.9615384615384617
1536011,5,B00005JOD1,"I saw this in cinerama back when it first came out (yeah, I'm THAT old!) LOVED it!  Fifteen years ago, I purchased VHS for my stepdaughter to watch -- and she loved it (despite the hack job when they crammed it into full-screen mode).  I still have the old, worn, and much loved VHS version, but am hoping that DVD will come out soon, and hopefully at least in letterbox format.  I suspect that my 6-year-old great neice will also love the movie.  Special effects are dated, but still fun, especially the cobbler's elves.",1257120000,,521,4.51063829787234
1536012,5,B00005JOD1,"This beautiful movie was just shown on TCM at 6 in the morning. It was the first time I had seen it since it was released in theatres over 40 years ago.
When is it going to be released on DVD? It will delight children of all ages! And lots of older folks too!",1251763200,,259,3.814814814814815
1536013,5,B00005JOD1,"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm was filmed in Cinerama, with three cameras to provide a true panoramic view of the world.  The only important Cinerama film to have survived in a watchable version is How The West Was Won.  Unfortunately there are NO cinemas anywhere equipped to project Cinerama properly.  One of the last ones standing was the Dabel Cinema in Dayton, Ohio, which was closed decades ago.  :-( That said, you CAN watch How the West Was Won on a ""widescreen"" TV and enjoy it thoroughly. Too bad, the same can't be said of this treasure.

I saw this as a child, and still remember the Terry Thomas/Buddy Hackett sequence (The Singing Bone) as my favorite movie segment of my entire youth.  The Dancing Princess segment is noteworthy as well.  Unfortunately, I saw it, not in true Cinerama, but in a 35mm print that was made so the movie could be shown in smaller movie houses.  About a third of the material captured by each of the outside cameras was sacrificed.  Then, as a result of years of careless storage on the part of the owners, the only surviving 70 mm print of the entire three-camera version was damaged beyond repair.

The 35mm versions weren't treated much better.  When VHS came out, there was enough left to patch together one reasonably watchable print for transfer to video.

Many comments here complain about the shabby 35mm-to-vhs conversion, but the problem is that the remaining 35mm versions are actually THAT BAD.

We've seen other movies that were restored by computer to like-new condition, or in some cases, better-than-new.  I would love to see whoever owns the rights to this now cough up $10 million or whatever it takes to have someone reconstruct EITHER the 35mm version or what's left of the true Cinerama version frame by frame.

In the meantime, if a DVD of this that's even REASONABLY watchable is ever produced, you owe it to your family to get it just for the fantasy sequences.  Special effects fans love to point out that those sequences pushed the state-of-the art in every direction back then. But I'll add that, because of the quality of the acting and direction, they are just as charming today.

Five stars for the original content. Zero stars for the studio's 'management' of this unique property.

Are your ears on, Ted Turner?  Stephen Spielberg? Anybody with money and respect for good content?

1536014,4,B00005JOD1,"Although this may be considered a B Movie and not the very best effects by todays standards, it still is a good deal of fun for most families. As a child I saw this with my family and we found it entertaining. Since I am still entertained by most fantasy and science fiction movies I enjoyed as a child, I think most will agree there certainly is a niche for this type movie for families today. If for no other reason it is family friendly, and lots of fantasy and scifi today are not. The movie is loosely based on some of the fairytales told by the Grimm brothers. Good quality DVD with minimum of extras.

1536016,5,B00005JOD1,"I have loved this movie since I saw it in the 1960s.  A few years ago, I was flipping through the dial and came across a wide screen version that had introductory material about the Prussian War.  It was shown on Turner Classic Movies.  I would love to have a DVD copy of this version.  Anyone know where I can find it?",1210809600,,319,4.096774193548387

7940938,5,B00005JOD1,"This is NOT a review of this DVD since my copy on Laserdisc is probably much better.  I'm wondering if this wonderful film will ever get a restoration such as the other Cinerama films have received.  I have heard rumors that the original negatives were destroyed in a fire at MGM and, supposedly, only one remaining print survives.  David Strohmeier has worked miracles on the other Cinerama films, so I'm wondering if he is secretly working on this one.  He is our only hope of ever seeing this great film again, so let's ""keep the faith!""",1493856000,4,540,4.59375

7940942,4,B00005JOD1,"Because of the lack of attention given to this film by both MGM and Cinerama, I was glad to find this Italian release. Both my computer and DVD player are zone-free (it's easy to get both, as zone-free softwares available to download), so I had no reason not to buy it for not living in Europe, and the more so since until today (July 10, 2015) there has been no release of a restored version. One has to admit though, that beyond the complaint for the division lines of the Cinerama projection, the full experience of inventor Fred Waller's system (opposed to Abel Gance's Polyvision) could only be achieved in a cinema with curved screen. On a flat screen, no matter if the motion picture has been ""smileboxed"" or not, the image is always slightly distorted. So buy it, it is as good as when you saw it in 1962. If you had never seen it, be warned of the slight distortion, the two lines and the lack of restoration. But to my surprise this Italian release has an acceptable image quality. I enjoyed it again very much. I did not know there were many persons who thought this is a better film than ""How the West Was Won"". I also believe this. There is no propaganda here, no patriotic hymns and the script is tighter: instead of the story of three generations (Karl Malden's, Debbie Reynolds' and George Peppard's, in ""HTWWW""), in ""TWWOTBG"" you only have the life of two brothers with three fairy tales inserted along the writers' partial biography. If you expect CGIs from George Pal's animation, see something else, and if not, enjoy his puppets and dragon. The cast, on the other hand, includes various cult players, as Beulah Bondi, Terry-Thomas, Martita Hunt, Ian Wolfe and Oscar Homolka; popular comedians as Jim Backus, Buddy Hackett and Arnold Stang; young stars of the 60s as Yvette Mimieux, Robert Crawford Jr. and Russ Tamblyn, and a good leading cast: Laurence Harvey, Karlheinz Bhm, Claire Bloom, Barbara Eden and Walter Slezak.

7940944,5,B00005JOD1,"How the West Was Won as most people know has been available in a SmileBox format preserving the effect of the deeply curved Cinerama screen. They had a nearly pristine negative to work from. David Strohmaier has done an excellent job in preserving and restoring all of the original 3 strip Cinerama travelogues and making them available on bluray utilizing the SmileBox format. Hopefully WWOFBG will be added to this list if possible. One 70mm film released as a Cinerama film, Holiday in Spain is available on bluray in SmileBox format. A lot of Cinerama purist thumb their nose at labeling any 70mm film as being Cinerama. It is true that 70mm cannot truly replicate 3 strip Cinerama but it is part of it's history that they did make the switch to 70mm with It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. I have seen many 70mm films on the deeply curved Cinerama screen, even 70 mm blowups and they all looked impressive. Yes it is NOT true Cinerama but to criticize a 70 mm film being shown in SmileBox  format on home video is a much as saying that 70 mm ""Cinerama"" never existed at all. Mike Todd Sr. tried Cinerama ""out of one hole"" with Todd AO on  120 degree curved screen and it looked good. I personally welcome such films made available in SmileBox format. It allows a whole new generation an opportunity to see how movies were presented in the 1950's and '60's and preserves a wonderful part of film history.",1417824000,2,1403,4.519685039370079
7940945,3,B00005JOD1,It was great to see this movie on dvd. But the picture quality was poor It was originally a Cinerama movie and there were lines on the screen where the from the projectors met.

7940946,5,B00005JOD1,"Disclaimer! You have to have a system which can actually let you view a Region 2 PAL DVD.
If you don't know what that means, PAL is the video format for other countries - the USA uses NTSC (Never The Same Color according to my Eurofamily), so you may not be able to even watch this. Furthermore, DVDs are often encoded to be viewed in specific regions of the world. The USA is Region 1, this is Italy.
Possible solutions: You CAN tell your computer to change your DVD drive to region 2, but maybe only once or twice.
The DVD has English, so you can then watch it once or twice.

As for the movie...This was a Cinerama classic. If you remember seeing it as a child, you will want to see it again. Yes, That IS Barbara Eden as Lawrence Harvy's love interest. Buddy Hackett trying to do a British accent will make Dick VanDyke feel better about Mary Poppins. Good memories - don't know how today's kids will take to it, but we'll see what the grandsons think...",1397606400,4,958,4.292817679558011
