3667295,5,B001KOYXBW,"""Wednesday"" is a new kind of movie for a Bollywood production.

The only way I can describe this movie accurately is to compare it to the fast paced cut-scenes seen in the 'Bourne' series of movies. The pace of the plot is relentless and no time is wasted in any of the useless singing and dancing and other ridiculous times wasting activities that one sees in the usual Bollywood fare. Brainless dialog also typical of Bollywood movies is non-existent.

Stuff said in this movie usually has a direct effect in subsequent scenes.

The movie is about the frustration felt by the ordinary person in India who has to live at the mercy of terrorist outfits running loose and unleashing indiscriminate terror on average people and the slow pace of delivering justice to captured criminals (it is a fact that India has been suffering from terrorist activities for several decades now in various forms).

Well, one ordinary guy (Naseeruddin Shah) is fed up and decides to do something about it.

Long story short, this movie is great! The movie is primarily carried by Anupam Kher however Naseeruddin is precise and authentic in delivering his role.

There are some slight Hindi movie type ""issues"" with excessive violence but its only a light sprinkle considering the movie was made for Indian consumption.

I hope ""Wednesday"" sets a trend and being a trend-setter this one deserves 5 stars.",1233705600,,1385,4.8931623931623935
3667296,5,B001KOYXBW,"A lone terrorist has planted bombs at different locations in Mumbai, and threatens to blow them up unless certain terrorists are freed. Is he bluffing? No. Can he be caught? Not likely, given that he is super smart. The Mumbai police commissioner receives information about a bomb supposedly planted in a police station opposite the police headquarters. When the bomb threat turns out to be true, the police have to take the caller seriously. He has demands, and won't negotiate, nor be placated, nor agree to any delays.

It has no songs. The pace never slacks. Editing is tight. The plot does not get sidetracked into parallel lines. The acting is superb. The dialogs are not cliched, nor preachy.

Given the terrorist strikes of 26/11 that took place several months after its release, the movie seems prophetic.

Watch it for the acting prowess of Naseeruddin Shah and Anupan Kher. Shah for most of the movie, sits behind a desk on the roof of an under construction building, speaking on the phone. So he has to use his facial expressions and voice to act. Yet it is a performance that would be beyond the capabilities of all but less than a handful of actors today. Anupam Kher is effortless in his performance. Jimmy Shergil and others are competent too.",1231372800,3,1259,4.76605504587156
3667297,5,B001KOYXBW,"A WEDNESDAY.

This is written by a US viewer for the benefit of anyone unfamilliar with Indian movies.

Indian movies are currently the quality of the best production movies of Hollywood regarding plots, acting, filming (lighting, focus), direction, acting and everything else. They often follow the 1940's formula requiring one or two irrelevant musical and dancing scenes (with full orchestra). Hence the sobriquet ""Bollywood"". Technology is up-to-date. Customs reflect the former British rule. Dialog is often bilingual, with Hindi and English in the same sentence (like English & Spanish in some US cities) and the viewer may have difficulty keeping up with the sub-titles.

Three caveats: (1) scenes are limited to prosperous areas of modern cities, (2) police procedures are not according to US tastes (don't even think of breaking a law in India), and (3) political/social concepts are not according to US political correctness. (This movie apparently was not intended for release in the US.)

That said, this movie is an unrelieved fast-action police story, set in Mumbai (Bombay), and regards a terrorist bombing plot. There is an extended political dissertation at the end (hence the disclaimer #3 above). Nothing more needs to be said. If you like this sort of thing, then definitely this is the sort of thing you will like.",1371254400,,1335,5.224299065420561
3667298,4,B001KOYXBW,"I hear that Bollywood cranks out an enormous number of films each year but that they essentially work 7 plots over and over. I've seen a few that would be considered world class. They have been great films. Here they enter the crime thriller genre and do a real stand-up job of it.

Here's the scoop. An older man on a rooftop phones a police official and tells him he's planted six bombs throughout the city, all set to go off at the same time. His demands are simple. He wants four known terrorists released from prison and brought to a particular location. The official has little choice but sends his people to work to find out who the caller is and avoid a possibly bleak outcome. It's a game of wills and wits.

This is a really cool flick. Who is this guy? What are his motives? He doesn't seem like the cold-blooded criminal he makes himself out to be. But he's planned things down to a ""T"" and has the officials running around gathering every bit of intel possible. I don't know many Bollywood actors but the police chief looked familiar. The acting is decent overall but two of the police officers on the case are alluded to as being worth note and they weren't. Their characters needed some big time fleshing out. The plot moved well. The villain kept everyone jumping through hoops in a logical fashion. When they deliver the punchline it's pretty cool. I half suspected it but it was neat none the less. Music and shooting were good. I suppose what it comes down to is how you feel about the villain's motives. Yes. He has his reasons but are they sound? This is a judgement call to be sure.

This is a heck of a movie. It plays well to western sensibilities. And it's appropriate to what is happening in the world now. If you're into intense crime thrillers, this is a good road to travel.",1365120000,,1803,4.408408408408408
3667299,4,B001KOYXBW,"""A Wednesday"" is an action thriller. The movie takes place over just a couple hours. A man calls the police and threatens to detonate four bombs scattered around Mumbai unless four terrorists are released.

This is not your typical Bollywood movie. There was no singing and dancing. It is also a short 103 minutes, but it is well done and moves quickly.  It has a few surprising twists, but they are reasonable.

The Commissionar of Police is Anupam Kher who was the father in ""Bride and Prejudice.""",1349136000,,499,4.712643678160919
3667300,3,B001KOYXBW,"Rented because of Naseeruddin Shah. I have to say that this was quite a surprising turn given my initial introduction to the man as the sweet spiritual cabbie in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Today-s-Special/dp/B004K4FUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Today's Special</a>'.

Still, despite the near one-hundred-eighty-degree difference in the performance, I liked the movie.

Like so many films that are produced outside of the US market, the screenplay, in particular the characterizations, are sometimes difficult to adjust to. If this were a US film, it might feature a star like Steven Seagal.

Every character seems to be a hyper-version of the actual person or position, more symbolic rather than an attempt at a genuine captured reflection. Pure archetypes, with no possibility of subtle variance. Police and security officers are handsome, swarthy, bold and brave - their only duty to justice. Common criminals are weak, cowardly and easily bullied; apparently slapping them in a variety of situations renders quite a positive result. And their true enemy are the terrorists - who are cold calculating heartless monsters.

Films like these tends to border on societal browbeating wired to a pounding soundtrack. But if I understand India, her politics, daily life and challenges - it's reasonable in that context. Pure blacks and whites, no gray allowed.

In 'Wednesday' - we start the film as the former police commissioner reflects on the most memorable case of his long career. In fact, other than the immediate participants, who were sworn to secrecy, no record exists of the actual incident. All the evidence and events covered up under the guise of less malicious crimes and terrible accidents. But what really happened was...

So begins the cat-n-mouse game between a master bomber and the five devices he's planted across Mumbai. Will the authorities find the fiend before it's too late - or will they capitulate and release four terrorists?

I would be lying if I said I wasn't looking for another Naseeruddin performance similar to my first exposure to the man, but this film only enhances my belief that his skill and range is formidable. A superior actor that I will continue to seek out.

A decent movie that moves along a quick pace, but one that I feel could use a bit of bolstering in the reality department. Not a lot, just a touch of sprucing up the edges and tightening the script to accommodate more depth to the characters. Additionally, I felt the use of two 'top cops' was distracting and lessened the impact of both characters. I know there's a cultural aspect here that I don't get, but I still think it would've improved the focus of the film to have one single badass.

3667303,4,B001KOYXBW,"Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher have given stellar performances in this movie which caused quite a sensation everywhere.

An exasperated retired suburbanite of Mumbai (Naseeruddin Shah) revolts against the terrorist bombings of local trains in Mumbai in 2005 and becomes obsessed with how the culprits evade final justice for these heinous crimes. He embarks upon a plan to `take the law in his own hands', and mete out like punishment to the perpetrators.

The single-mindedness of this `amateur' is astonishing and his simple but brilliant plan, which looks `oh so plausible' as it unfolds, is chilling.

The police are coerced to do his bidding and the protagonist succeeds in swiftly delivering `an eye for an eye', on a Wednesday, and hence the title.

The narrative is taut, blunt and throws all punches. It is an edge of the seat thriller, and a `must not be missed' category movie.",1296864000,,890,4.993243243243243
3667304,4,B001KOYXBW,I had seen this movie prior to purchasing.  It is has good suspense and mystery until the very end.  Acting is believable and the actors are attractive to watch.  The reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because some scenes are very violent.  The violence contributes to the story but it just a lot.

3667306,4,B001KOYXBW,"As this movie was produced PRIOR to the 2008 Mumbai bombings, I can see why folks consider it prophetic.  Draws some eerie parallels.

I've watched way more Bollywood movies than most American gals (and some without subtitles), so my opinion here is not without basis for comparison.

This movie's thought provoking plot did well to touch on the deep rooted assumptions, stereotypes and mistrust/hate that are the undercurrent of Indian politics and culture.  In A Wednesday, the familiar tension between Hindus and Muslims was employed to bait the viewer into assuming how the story would end.  However it delivered a twist that was quite good.

I didn't appreciate the seemingly 20-minute monologue at the end, but I can swallow it.  It was no worse than watching Heath Ledger drone on in The Dark Knight.

While this movie was good, it was far from raising goose bumps as came with the true mortal terror one senses when watching Mr. and Mrs. Iyer.",1242518400,,951,4.863354037267081

8315638,1,B001KOYXBW,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. In fact, it was so terrible that I am not even sure where to begin. Let's ignore the plot for now and just talk about the production quality. The camera work was so amateurish and jumpy that this wouldn't even be good enough for cheap TV drama. The fighting scenes were so ridiculous with odd cartoony punching sounds. The one scene containing an explosion actually showed outlines of three burning humans (looking more like burning scarecrows really) flying in the flames in midair! I realize that the film was probably low budget but that doesn't have to preclude good taste. Speaking of the plot, Dick Cheney would love this movie. The answers to terrorism problems are all apparently simple - simple ordinary patriots just coming up with simple solutions. Our legal and justice systems are slow and inefficient, why bother with them? Let's just use vigilante justice and kill the ""cockroaches that have entered our house"" (their words, not mine). The police commissioner makes a meek attempt to reason with this simple ordinary patriot but the simple man is only ""concerned about the end-result, not the way to achieve it."" Apparently, we actually want police brutality towards citizens (the assumption being that it will always be directed at the ""others"", not at us or our friends or families). Yes, having to account for brutal violent behavior in a democracy can be such a pain - just gets in the way of everything, doesn't it? This is basically a poorly made piece of trash that is trying to legitimize the use of brutal force and violence by governmental agencies when there is any security situation. It isn't even intelligent right wing propaganda. I would mostly describe it as xenophobic and an insult to basic human decency. What Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah are doing in this film is really beyond me. Don't waste your time.",1432944000,,1893,4.827692307692308
