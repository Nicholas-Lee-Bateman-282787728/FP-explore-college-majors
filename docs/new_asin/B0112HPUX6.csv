7320232,3,B0112HPUX6,"Not the best of the series by any means.  I had some pretty high expectations because our household really liked the first one and loved the second one!  So this one was a let down unfortunately.  The animation is still well done, the story itself just doesn't seem that well thought through and the 'Friendship Games' themselves are a bit odd since it is actually a competition between two rival schools.  And without giving too much away it definitely has a similar overall feel to it as the first but with some role reversals in the mix.  Overall, this is one that my daughter still enjoys because she likes just about anything MLP but it is one that I won't really sit down and watch with her as much as the first two.",1461628800,,722,4.398496240601504
7320233,3,B0112HPUX6,"Our family loves the MLP series. Even my husband will sit and watch episodes with us and we ALL enjoy them. The first two movies with the Equestria Girls were totally worth buying, this one left a bit to be desired.
We bought the first two, and have had watched them over and over and overthe songs, the story, the charactersyou just cant help but fall in love and sing along. This movie felt like it was trying too hard. The songs weren't as catchy, and the story just didn't feel as fun. We bought this when it first came out (Sept 2015) and my kids have only watched it 2x
Save the money and watch it on Netflix. The first two were worth buying even if on Netflix, but this one just hasn't quite been as much of a favorite.
But it wasn't all bad. The story is cute, the characters are what you expect from MLP and the lessons learned are still valuable from your kids favorite pony pals.",1460678400,,890,4.2105263157894735

7320309,4,B0112HPUX6,"I thought the inclusion of the deleted scenes and the developer commentary were good, and it was more bonus content than the previous titles in the series, though having so many deleted scenes in and of themselves and some of the words from the commentary tells its own story about the production of this movie. Maybe they also could've included a vocal-less instrumental sing-along like in the first EG.

I felt they could've expanded more on the other characters that were widely used in the promotional material, merchandise, and in the movie's intro sequence, but much of that was shafted in favor for the actual antagonist who doesn't really have much to show for beyond the movie itself; not even toys. Instead, said characters are just...there. May as well have used them, like they'd already done when introducing new toy-characters in the previous two titles.

If you really liked Rainbow Rocks, then this one may disappoint you a tad, but in my opinion it's still better than the first EG. Timeline-wise, this movie should take place after the Season 5 finale of the main Friendship is Magic series, which aired this past weekend, and I think honestly should've been released after the season ended; you can watch it after finishing the main series up to this point and it'd fit. Plot-wise, the major changes they made to the original only show how it isn't held together as well as it could have been, but I personally never expect anything groundbreaking from this series considering it's more of a merchandise-pusher than the main series is.

The songs on the other hand were very nice, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Little-Pony-Equestria-Girls-The-Friendship-Games-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0159585GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Little Pony Equestria Girls: The Friendship Games (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>&nbsp;is worth having a look at.",1449014400,2,1936,5.578231292517007

7320351,5,B0112HPUX6,"My daughter has been watching the Equestria Girls movies since they first came out and was anxiously awaiting the release of this movie.  In this movie we get introduced to the human version of Twilight when Crystal Prep comes to Canterlot High for the Friendship Games.  Twilight, a student at Crystal Prep, is forced to participate in the games by her principal.  She doesnt want to compete and is much more interested in the magic readings she is getting from the school.  While at Canterlot High, Twilight manages to capture enough friendship magic to become magical herself.  She feels the power of the magic and opens the path to Equestria in hopes to take all of that magic as well.  Sunset Shimmer is about to conjure up enough friendship magic to defend Equestria and Canterlot High and convince Twilight to stop what she is doing.  In the end Twilight gives in and stops capturing the magic.  She then decides that she wants to transfer to Canterlot High.  All of the girls are sitting around and then Pony Twilight comes through the portal and sees her human self.  That is how the movie ends setting it up perfectly for another movie.",1448064000,,1146,4.685

7320354,5,B0112HPUX6,"Yet, another great entry to the Equestria Girls film series!
Obviously, these movies aren't for everybody. However, they are ""family""-oriented, with a story for kids to understand, and dark tones for the adult fans of the series. Sure, Friendship Games doesn't top what Rainbow Rocks did, but it is still a solid film in the series! It wraps up the ""SciTwi"" story arc in the most clever way possible, and leaves it open for all-new possibilities to the story! Plus, the DVD/Blu-Ray release comes with some excellent extra content for the hardcore fans to enjoy, including audio commentary and deleted scenes!

Pros:
+Human Twilight
+Shadowbolts have very unique personalities!
+More fantastic music from series composer Daniel Ingram
+Excellent Writing
+Very interesting extra features!

Cons:
-Ending is a bit ""flawed"".
-Leaves some plot holes open.
-No ""real"" interaction between the two Twilight Sparkles.

Nevertheless, Friendship Games is fantastic, and I encourage everyone to watch it if you're a fan of Disney or other animated musicals, whether you're new to the series or not!
Let's go, Wondercolts! :D

7320400,3,B0112HPUX6,"(warning, psuedo spoilers) Eh. It wasn't as solid as the first EQG film, and definitely wasn't even close to how great Rainbow Rocks was. I DID enjoy how smooth and well animated it was, which is expected as they continue to refine and improve. However, the story killed a lot of it for me. It felt very rushed and just kind of thrown together. It was VERY typical and obvious. The main antagonist was too over the top and stereotypical ""evil schoolmarm"" for my liking. The villainous 6 that oppose the Mane 6 in it also felt too forced. I feel like they could've had a good presence, but the film didn't allow them any time to be developed. At the end of the film, we get a 'psuedo' change in character from them (but they stay mostly antagonist still), which left me thinking ""Okay, they're not actually changed, they just threw their leader under the bus, because they knew they'd been beaten."" - And the huge showdown (which I will NOT spoil at all) was just waaaaaaay too cheesy for me.

Don't get me wrong, because it was beautifully executed in its animation and appearance. It just... it felt like they just yanked from the first film. It didn't feel original or interesting to me at all, beyond the visuals they put in. --- Bear in mind, I'm criticizing because I love the series and want to see it be the best it can. Rainbow Rocks blew me away, and after expecting another big step forward, this felt disappointing. I can't say it was terrible, but it's definitely my least favorite of the three films. I wish they spent more time on a better story, or at the very least extended the film by twice the time to allow the story to be flushed out the way it should've been to let it be something worthy.

Breaking it down into simple numbers, I'd rate it a 3/5, or a 6/10. Compared to Rainbow Rocks, which I give a 5/5 and 10/10. Or the first EQG which I'd give a 4/5 and a 9/10.",1446768000,5,1887,4.327683615819209

7320432,4,B0112HPUX6,"Although the ""My Little Pony"" brand has been around since the 80s, it wasn't until it's newest incarnation, ""Friendship is Magic"", that the toyline-turned-TV show saw an explosion of popularity all around the world, with it's complex and relatable characters, eye catching artwork, great music, and mythical world. So when fans began drawing artwork of what they would imagine the ponies to look like as regular humans, the showrunners took notice and gave us the movie, ""Equestria Girls"", in which Twilight Sparkle discovered an alternate universe where all the characters we love on the show are human beings. The movie did well enough to garner a sequel, ""Rainbow Rocks"", in which Sunset Shimmer had to prove to her school that she'd reformed from her evil ways. And after being super impressed with the sequel, I was hyped to see this third outing into the humanized alternate universe.

While I very much enjoyed this movie, and found it better than ""Equestria Girls"", sadly, it didn't quite match the brilliance of ""Rainbow Rocks"".

Taking place not long after the events of the second movie, Canterlot High prepares to take on their rival school, Crystal Prep Academy (this world's version of the pony-verse's Crystal Empire), in an Olympics-style competition called the Friendship Games. By this point, the humanized Mane 5 have begun to learn how to access their magic powers beyond simply playing music, to which Sunset Shimmer is tasked with keeping magic out of the competition to keep it fair (while also trying to discover how and why the Elements of Harmony seem to be changing and growing stronger). All seems to be running fairly smoothly...until Sunset and the Mane 5 are confronted with their world's version of Twilight Sparkle, who is not only unintentionally hurting and tampering with the Elements of Harmony as she tries to study them, but acts extremely different from the princess they (and the audience) know back in Ponyville. Will Canterlot High be able to win the Friendship Games? And can Sunset and the Mane 5 teach their Twilight the magic of true friendship?

Much like the first two movies, the film likes to play the ""Where's Waldo"" game, and point out all of the various background ponies of the show, but in human form. Some fans felt that having Technicolor humans was weird, but I myself think it was a wise choice. For one thing, it makes spotting the characters easier, and for another, there's no argument as to what ethnicity/race any of the characters are. Other new ponies that appeared on the show in between this movie and the last get their humanized debut here, including Shining Armor and Cadence.

As for the plot, it pretty much belongs to Sunset and Twilight, with Sunset having to take on PonyTwilight's role of teacher and mentor, and use the lessons she learned in the first two movies to help ""SciTwi"" (as the fans call her) basically go through the same story arc she went through on the TV show. But SciTwi is far from being a carbon copy of pre-show PonyTwilight.  While PonyTwilight was much more stern and proud of seemingly not needing anyone, SciTwi, on the other hand, is much closer to Fluttershy in terms of personality. It's clear on a few occasions that she DOES desire friends, but doesn't quite know how to go about making any, and lacks a lot of self confidence to do so. This is largely to blame because of her villainous principal, who only desires to win the games and the reputation of her school, and isn't above threatening to flunk Twilight to get what she wants. And back to the subject of Sunset, the situation also helps her learn to have more faith in herself and her abilities, especially when the portal between universes is cut off for a time, and she realizes she won't have PonyTwilight to constantly bail her out when things go wrong.

However, the movie DID have it's fair share of things that kept me from liking it as much as ""Rainbow Rocks"". For one thing, the music/songs, while great, aren't nearly as memorable as they were in the second movie. (I'm reviewing this after having just watched it, and I already can't remember any of the songs...I remember WHERE there was a song, but not how it went.) The rivals from Crystal Prep (who are there to basically be jerkish mirrors of the Mane 5) don't get a whole lot of characterization, and are also forgettable (I guess it doesn't help that they're not based off of any pony we know in the other universe). Fans of the pony world will also be disappointed that we don't get to visit it at all, unlike the first two films (save for tiny glimpses dotted here and there). But most of all, the ending, while touching, is pretty much a retread of the ending to the first movie, with only a few minor differences.

SPOILER ALERT

The film also ends with SciTwi joining the humanized Mane 5. While this is okay, personally, I felt SciTwi should've returned to her own school to help spread the magic of friendship there (with the ManeCrystalPrep5 becoming her friends). After two movies, I've grown to like Sunset Shimmer acting as the human world's Twilight, and having her complete the Mane 6. Having both her and Twilight together seems to make one of them almost a third wheel to the Mane 5. Or if SciTwi was going to stay, then have Sunset return to Ponyville with the new knowledge of friendship she's gained. Because thinking about it, they still haven't explained where the original HumanSunset went to...meaning there's still two Sunset Shimmers running around in the human-verse.

END OF SPOILERS

Bottom line, I still enjoy these occasional peeks into this alternate universe. But looking at the Equestria Girls trilogy as a whole, the first movie was a nice introduction; the second movie was superior, with more and better character development, and this third movie contained even more interesting developments...but also recycled a bunch of ideas from the previous films and the TV show. Never the less, if they do decide to make more movies with the ""Humane 6"", I can't wait to see where they take these people next...or if some of the new characters will make an appearance in the pony world.",1445299200,,6147,4.779661016949152
7320433,5,B0112HPUX6,"If you're expecting Equestria-Twilight to play a role in this movie, you'll be disappointed.  What we have instead is human-Twilight all the way, and is she ever endearing!  (E-Twi does make a brief appearance at the very end.)  This movie continues Sunset's growth.  She battles her EG desire to blow up at people, and needs her friends to help calm her.  But ultimately, she shows herself to be a leader and helps save them all again, as she did in RR.  We really like how these movies, altogether, show how someone can do bad things, learn from them, and do good, and this one shows you can slip up, but still be good.

FG-Twilight represents a bullied nerd, which is something many kids deal with in real life.  When I was a kid...  Let's say I could have used a role model like her.  She's dealing with an educational need being pitted against doing what's right for others.  In this film, they didn't merge for a while thanks to the principal of her own school being cruel to her (Vice-principal Cadence is sweet though).  In an interesting twist, she is the creator of the device that causes a lot of the problems in the movie!  It's the sort of device we would expect from an antagonist, even though she's a protagonist in this movie!

Ah, but how's the music?  The first song is strange if you're expecting the grand scale they usually are, but it works for the scene since Dash is leading a pep rally song.  It sounds like something a high school band would play, which is awesome!  The melodies of several songs are very sweet.  Twi's first song gets across very clearly her feeling of not being challenged (she does say the school's not at fault for that), of being an outsider, and not even knowing who she really is, and it's very touching.  I really appreciate how it ends with her resolving to take her future into her own hands.  We've got another song that's surprisingly dark, but fantastic.  All in all, the music lives up to the first two.

I know this is supposed to be the third and final film, but I hope they will decide to do more.",1445212800,4,2057,4.429333333333333

7320452,5,B0112HPUX6,"After two series consisting of seven seasons, almost 200 episodes and two movies, people might think the series is getting old. But, I think it is not even half way over. The third installment in My Little Pony: Equestrian Girls does not disappoint My Little Pony fans of all ages.

This movie is an adventure about the main characters. However, with most My Little Pony titles, friendship is a magic related thing. There is also a good amount of silly humor that viewers can enjoy and a small dose of drama which makes it more entertaining.

The story follows Twilight Sparkle, the only pony who seems to be able to go between the human and pony world. She hasn't been in contact with any of her human friends and one day she arrives there.  However, it isn't the Twilight they know. Additionally, the six friends are starting to get better control of their hidden magic powers which they need to learn to control for the friendship games (an athletic and academic competition between rivalry schools). If you would like to find out what happens, you have to watch the movie or read the book.

This film continues developing the positive reputation for the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic movies. The story is exciting, with many twists, and you still learn an important message. For this film, there are many. One of them is that, when help comes, accept it. The animation looks very tidy and, even though this is 2D animated, they are very creative with adding some 3D camera shots. The voice talent for Ashleigh Ball, Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash are spot on. Tara Strong who plays Twilight Sparkle makes us love the character, hate her and pity her all at the same time. The rest of the cast are also great at projecting the emotion of their characters. For example, in one scene with Applejack, she is helping her competition with archery and you don't hear pity in her voice, you hear a kind, friendly tone, which Ashleigh Ball is so known for.

My favorite scene is when two of the main characters are fighting the enemy high school on a dirt bike course. It includes my favorite character, Rainbow Dash and another main character, Fluttershy. The race goes well at first. However when the other Twilight Sparkle accidentally releases some strange magic, the race goes haywire.

There is something you should be aware of. You don't need to follow the TV show that the film is based on in order to understand the storyline of the film. However, it is probably best if you watch the first movie, My Little Pony: Equestrian Girls, in order to understand this story.

Age rating is surprising for My Little Pony. A lot of people think this show is meant for 2 to 6-year-olds. But really, it is suitable for older kids and event adults. Many of this show's fans (including me) are 12 years old and older so, I recommend this for ages 2 to 18 and adults as well. Small children will enjoy the fun, bright, colors and the funny characters. But, older kids and adults enjoy the show as a fans. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars because it entertains people while teaching important messages. This film is out on DVD/Blu-ray on October 13 so check it out.

7320455,2,B0112HPUX6,"I waited a long time for this movie, so I was disappointed because I expected so much more.

The music was not nearly as good as the music in the first two movies.

My favorite song from the first movie, ""Equestria Girls,"" was the cafeteria song, ""Helping Twilight Win the Crown.""

My favorite song from the second movie, ""Rainbow Rocks,"" was ""Shake Your Tail.""

Applejack is my favorite character.

Rarity is my least favorite character, although I did enjoy seeing the sports costumes that she designed.

There was too much sports in this movie.

I didn't like it that Spike did not talk, and then all of a sudden he did.

I didn't like the brand new character of the principal.

The story was all over the place, with no real coherence.

Vinyl Scratch never does anything, and so I would have appreciated if she did something, because I really like the character.
In the second movie, Vinyl Scratch got the Mane Six out from underneath the stage, where they were trapped, and then she helped them to defeat the Dazzlings by setting up a DJ Station.
But, in this movie, she didn't do anything.
In one of the eight animated shorts which came before ""Rainbow Rocks,"" she walked around town, listening to her headphones, like a reference to the beginning of ""Saturday Night Fever.""

Derpy didn't do anything in this movie either, except for making her usual cameo.
I would really like to see her have a story.
She talked a lot in ""Slice of LIfe,"" the hundredth episode.
The only other time that she talked was in ""The Last Roundup"" when she helped Rainbow Dash.

I am still looking forward to the next movie, and I certainly hope that there will be one.
I heard that there will be another movie in 2017, which does not yet have a title.
In the next movie, I would love if one of the Mane Six, such as Fluttershy, would fall in love and have a storybook romance to make Cinderella jealous.
Fluttershy would look great in glass slippers and a flowing gown.
She should fall in love with a brand new character, a bad boy.

I hoped to see more of Fluttershy in this movie, she hardly had any scenes.

The scene of the magic transformation was amazing.

7320497,5,B0112HPUX6,"Touching and sweet but honestly kind of similar to the first Equestria Girls movie in story.

Here's the short minimal spoiler version:
It's basically the first Equestria Girls movie in plot except a bit more different (there's more stuff happening all around than the first EG). However, I still enjoyed it a lot and it was touching. Personally, I love both EG #1 and EG #3 equally (Rainbow Rocks I also liked but movie #1 and #3 were more touching to me, personally at least).

For the review below, I'll call the Twilight in this movie ""EG Twilight"" (since she is from the Equestria Girls universe), while Ponyville Twilight, I'll call her FIM Twilight (Friendship is Magic Twilight).

(Now here's a bit more in-depth review. There will be some spoilers in the Positives and Negatives section, and then major spoilers later).

Positives:
1. I think the pacing and progression of plot is great in Friendship Games (FG). At least for me, there was never a dull moment and I was invested in the scenes (and interested in finding out what happens next). The first Equestria Girls had few dull moments. Rainbow Rocks (IMO) while I did enjoy, it didn't have as much sense of progression in plot or conflict.

Compared to the other two, I find that Friendship Games good progression in conflict. What I mean is, conflict is presented - attempt to resolve conflict - conflict now resolved - then move on to next conflict. The conflict could be a character struggling with something or something that needs to be accomplished, etc. I found that Friendship Games did a good job at doing that.

2. EG Twilight is an extra character to explore. She isn't an exact copy of FIM is Twilight. More characters are always more fun for me.

3. The story is touching. Although, it really does feel like a repeat of the first Equestria Girls in story except with a few minor changes. However, it was still fun all the way through and I was really invested in EG Twilight.

Neutral:

1. The songs are more ""plot oriented"" type songs. I mean, I sort of didn't remember any song standing out (I did love one of the songs near the end with EG Twilight). They may not be the song that you'll listen to whenever. However, I did enjoy them (it fits the scenes and the plot). I liked all the Twilight songs (since it does explore her character), so that's at least good IMO.

2. Like I said, the plot is really similar to the first Equestria Girls. I mean, Rainbow Rocks is new, had new villains and characters, etc. However, this movie is basically like Equestria Girls #1 except with the Mane Six and Sunset Shimmer interacting with each other from the very beginning. Even the ending of Friendship Games is similar to EG #1. Despite that, I loved the movie but I can understand why people may dislike this.

There are even some scenes where EG Twilight meets the EG Mane Six (with Sunset Shimmer) for the first time that are kind of similar to the first Equestria Girls where FIM Twilight meets the EG Mane Five for the first time. So, you may get a sense of ""this has been done already"". Despite that though, I still enjoy exploring this Twilight in terms of character (though I can understand if others dislike this aspect).

Negatives:

1. The Crystal Prep characters weren't explored as much as EG Twilight. I mean, they were there but they didn't really have any big moments. The Sirens from Rainbow Rocks were probably a lot more explored and developed compared to any (outside of Twilight) Crystal Prep character in Friendship Games.

2. While I can understand the ending, I kind of didn't like the fact that EG Twilight changes school to Canterlot High. In the future movies, I would have liked if EG Twilight stayed at Crystal Prep. Obviously, that would mean they'd have to balance the characters and situations a lot more but it would add a lot to the story IMO.

I liked Crystal Prep a lot and would have liked to see more in the future but the ending kind of implies we may not see them again (since EG Twilight moved to Canterlot High).

Anyway, that's the movie summarized in positives, neutral, and negatives categories.

Some spoilers (more in depth review), what I think of the Equestria Girl movies and the series, and what I liked and didn't like:

Honestly, this movie is basically like the first Equestria Girls except instead of Friendship is Magic Twilight, you get Equestria Girls Twilight. I won't detail what happens exactly (because if you seen the first movie, it is almost like that). I'll point out the specific parts that stand out though.

The ending is almost identical to the first Equestria Girls too. Still though, I really felt invested in EG Twilight. I found that I love her a lot. Seeing EG Twilight's conflicts in this movie, really touched me.

I love My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic but at times I feel the series doesn't present conflicts that really explore the characters enough in the regular series (IMO). What I truly loved about the first Equestria Girls was because you get to see another side of FIM Twilight. FIM Twilight is usually confident of her abilities (she gets nervous at times) and always find some way to succeed but in the first Equestria Girls, she really struggled and you get to see her be sad, and it really touched me. I really felt for Twilight in the first movie (the specific scene that did it for me was the scene where Twilight couldn't figure out how to use a vending machine and she looked so sad and said how she didn't know much about this world or if she can find a way this time; that's the scene that did it for me).

Now I admit, later (in the first EG movie; specifically after the EG Mane Five find out and accept the FIM Twilight), that the movie didn't have that sense of struggle anymore but the parts that did really touched me, I loved every moment (where Twilight struggled in the first movie).

Through that, you get to know Twilight better and you get to really feel her trying to succeed. It really touched and resonated with me.

Now with Friendship Games, I find that EG Twilight (this movie's Twilight) does a good job at presenting her conflicts and making you feel touched too as she tries to succeed (or as the Mane Six tries to help her). It's better than the first movie IMO.

In the first EG movie, how the movie would end became somewhat predictable as soon as FIM Twilight and EG Mane Five got together (I still loved it though).

However, in Friendship Games, I wasn't exactly sure what would happen in the next scene or how the next conflict will be resolved. So in that aspect, I think Friendship Games does a good job at least not revealing how it would be resolved later on (in fact, the ending of Friendship Games really surprised me, I didn't see that coming).

In terms of pacing and surprise, Friendship Games get a good score.

Not only that, but in the first EG movie, the sense of conflict with FIM Twilight was lost after she joined with the Mane Five. So, you didn't get to explore her character that much after that point.

However, in Friendship Games, EG Twilight is conflicted and struggles throughout the entire movie (until the very end).

In terms of sense of conflict and progression, Friendship Games get another good score.

Despite that though, Friendship Games is basically the first EG movie in terms of plot (at least it feels like it to me) except with some differences. And it is important to note that FIM Twilight is definitely not the same (at least not exactly) as EG Twilight. EG Twilight is a bit more shy, reserved, and she doesn't seem as confident as FIM Twilight (FIM Twilight, even before she met the Mane Five, seemed way more confident than this EG Twilight who was nervous and shy and kind of struggled all the way through).

Overall, I can really understand if people don't like this movie as much (compared to Rainbow Rocks) because this is basically the first EG movie in terms of plot (except with a few differences). However, I think the movie did a good job at exploring EG Twilight and presenting her conflicts for people to at least enjoy this movie. I definitely found that this movie touched me more than Rainbow Rocks (Rainbow Rocks I enjoyed but there wasn't a specific character moment where I felt that character struggling and really wanted them to succeed; the other two movies did a better job IMO).

Anyway, that's my review of the Friendship Games movie.",1443312000,6,8404,4.585723815877252

If you've never seen My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic you can feel free to skip these. On their own they will make zero sense to you. Speaking as someone who loves MLP:FiM I did my best to give these tie-in movies a chance but the scripts are lackluster compared to the show. I think the longer running time causes them to suffer. The writers seem better able to construct a well-paced story in the shows shorter running length compared to the movies which need to be twice as long (or two parters) to construct a story that makes any sense. Friendship Games feels like it's missing entire scenes and much of the plot either makes no sense, contradicts itself or has the characters acting in very out of character ways.

About the only thing good about these movies are a few of the songs and the voice acting. The main cast are seasoned pros who put a lot of heart into their characters which is why I can't totally hate on these movies but the characters deserve better. Whereas the main show's writers usually don't have to worry about forcing characters to do stuff just to sell toys it feels like this entire series is Hasbro's attempt to compete with Bratz. These movies are a huge waste of potential. As much as I really appreciate the people behind MLP:FiM I can't recommend people spend money on Equestria Girls.",1443312000,5,1469,4.5643939393939394

8723350,4,B0112HPUX6,"This third entry continues the Equestria Girls' habit of putting more effort into a high school film for young girls than one would expect. Again, this film does a strong job of using history and characterization from previous films. Former villain turned supporter Sunset Shimmer has become the leader of the group and it was a nice choice seeing the stress of her dealing with the aftereffects of the magic she released in the world of Canterlot High.

The plot, characters, and dialogue are all fun. The idea of the characters involved in a crazy competition worked well. Keep your eyes open for the obstacle course that can only exist in a children's film.

Liked the competing students, the Wondercolts. Yeah, they were probably created to sell more dolls and they don't have quite enough time to juggle them all, but the girls have personality. The main villain Principal Abbacus Cinch is one of the MLP universe's best villains. So delightfully prideful and manipulative. Special credit to should be given to her voice actress Iris Quinn who really nails it.

Animation is decent. Some of the character movements seemed a little awkward, but in fairness they were working on a straight-to-DVD budget. They did try to make the film as theatrical-looking as they could, especially during the musical numbers.

Speaking of the songs, they were all good, though not very memorable. The one highlight is the sinisterly, seductive, and chorus-heavy villain song ""Use the Magic."" In fact, I think it might be the best of all of Daniel Ingram's songs for the franchise.
