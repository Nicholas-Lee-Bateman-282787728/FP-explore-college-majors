7978034,3,B00007L3R4,"TV movie that moves kind of slow. Anthony Perkins pulls off his role very well. The ending is not much of a surprise, but there is a twist.",1449014400,,139,4.0
7978035,5,B00007L3R4,"i saw ""in the deep woods"" years ago when it was first on television.  it concerns a serial killer who murders people following nursery rhymes.  anthony perkins, in his last movie role, plays a man who is investigating the case.  it keeps you guessing until the very shocking end.  this movie aired soon after anthony perkins passed away.",1406332800,,337,4.758620689655173
7978036,4,B00007L3R4,"Entertaining mystery with a very talented cast. Arquette & Perkins are both wonderful to watch and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Drama,action,mystery it has it all. Have it on vhs but would definitely get it on dvd as well.",1366502400,,239,4.454545454545454
7978037,5,B00007L3R4,"This seller is wonderful, she goes above and beyond for her customers. The movie is very good, if you like suspense movies about women being murdered. I've never liked Rosanna Arquette better as the imperiled heroine. There were solid performances all around, especially by Chris Rydell, as the brother. I enjoyed Will Patton in a sympathetic (or was he?) role for a change. As for Anthony Perkins, maybe because it was the last role he did before his death, his energy was down. He was still very compelling.",1347667200,2,509,4.795454545454546
7978038,3,B00007L3R4,"This movie dragged a bit. I will not toss this one, just because I like Rosanna Arquette and Anthony Perkins",1242432000,,108,4.45
7978039,4,B00007L3R4,"As TV movies go, this one is a notch above others, thanks to a fine
performance by Rosanna Arquette as an illustrator of children's books
who finds herself in over her head when a serial killer takes over her life.  Fine support by Anthony Perkins (his last film), D.J. Moffatt,
and Will Patton in an amusing turn as the detective on the case. The
film springs some surprises, and the script stays on course.  Arquette
makes you believe that human lives are at stake here.  She stays inside
this character and inhabits it immaculately.  Highly recommended!",1186272000,8,556,4.760416666666667
7978040,3,B00007L3R4,"Anthony Perkin's last movie is as intriguing as his characters, specially Norman Bates, the one that took him into stardom. In this OK made-for-TV film he portrays Paul, a private eye supposed searching for the killer of your client. However,  he's in fact following Joanna Warren (Rosana Arquete). Because of his attitude, he becomes the # 1 suspect of a series of murders that are taking place in the woods. Is he the psychopath? While you are guessing, think about the great actor Mr. Perkins was. Certainly there will never be another psycho so convincing.",973555200,5,560,4.894736842105263
