720493,5,6303861377,I thank you for having all of these nostalgic dvd's I've bought lot's in the past and think they are great thanks again....mike martucci,1178928000,3,136,4.708333333333333
720494,3,6303861377,"This three episode collection issued by Alpha Video contains the same three episodes that have been issued by various companies specializing in public domain material; in fact, if you already own any DVDs of the Chuck Connors Western ""The Rifleman,"" be sure to compare the episodes on your discs with those contained on Alpha's so as to avoid possible duplication.  The episodes include ""Outlaw's Inheritance,"" ""Day of the Hunter,"" and ""Mail Order Groom.""  For casual fans of the series who would like to include a few episodes in their classic TV collection, this DVD will fit the bill nicely.  But serious fans of  ""The Rifleman"" will want to check out the various official DVD box sets issued by MPI for the best episode selection and best audio/visual quality.

Trivia Note:  John Anderson guest stars in two of the episodes, ""Day of the Hunter"" and ""Mail Order Groom.""  These two episodes were originally broadcast just a week apart!",1130284800,84,938,4.936305732484076
720495,5,6303861377,"I first saw "" The Rifleman "" series in Singapore in the mid 1960s. My family enjoyed watching this show. In particular, my elder brother and I grew up with the western films - on screen and TV. After more than 40 years, I still remember  vividly Chuck Connors as the super-hero Rifleman. I really enjoyed this DVD and saw all 5 series in a row. I long for more, as the Rifleman is a different kind of hero from the modern hero I see today. The Rifleman balances both compassion with justice in withholding right values against wrong. There is a sense of genuinness when he fought for justice compared with today's heroes.
The 5 shows are very clear with superb sound and voice clarity. Till today, Chuck Connors remains my favourite hero and justice icon.",1037059200,9,755,4.510948905109489
720496,4,6303861377,"""The Rifleman"" was on TV before I was born, and though I dimly remembered the show growing up, I really became acquainted with the program when it was carried for a time on the Family Channel a few years ago.  I enjoyed the program immensely, attracted by the relationship between Lucas McCain and his son Mark.  Wonderful acting by the tough as nails Chuck Connors, and the adorable Johnny Crawford.  Time really flies watching this program, it seems that it has only just begun, and then suddenly it's over.  The same can be said of this DVD, as the episodes seem to quickly slip by one after another.
McCain is a single father, trying to find a new life with his son in North Fork.  His goal is to teach his son what he needs to know to survive in the old wild West.  McCain's methods are basic ""tough love"", and may seem harsh by today's standards.  But underneath the gruff exterior, is the true warm love of a father for his son.  A similar treatment is applied to others undergoing life crisis, like the alcoholic Micah Torrance, and Michael Landon's outlaw character, as well as many others in future episodes in order to help them see the error of their ways.
Issues of morality are typically presented as black and white, compromise is usually out of the question.  Justice is often administered by McCain's tricked out Winchester lever-action rifle.  Some episodes (particularly Peckinpah's), not necessarily in this collection, are particularly violent.  The violence is treated as necessary, but the dead are not dwelt upon, and therefore the effect is softened, and passes as we fade to the commercial break.  McCain kills only when forced to, and as a last resort.
Others may not agree, but ""The Rifleman"" is a show about men, primarily for men.  Sure, it will find an audience with some women, but this show definitely has a masculine view of the world.  In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks, there may more of an audience for a program where moral issues are clear, and justice is swift.
My only complaint is that there is not enough material included.  Five episodes is good, but six, seven, or eight would have been better.  Sorry, but I'm greedy, and don't want to buy an excessive number of DVD's to complete a series (like Star Trek or Twilight Zone).  Volumes 3 and 4 already scheduled for release, so we can look forward to more Rifleman DVD's.  Picture quality is excellent, and Elmer Bernstein's moving music comes in at all the right moments.
Whether you are not familiar with this series or not, this is definitely the place to begin.  And thanks to MPI Home Video, there will be many more adventures on DVD to look forward to.  This collection is highly recommended, and the best is yet to come.",1008201600,29,2731,4.65
720497,5,6303861377,"Once you get beyond the kitschy intro and the occasional schmaltz, you get some outstanding early work by Sam Peckinpah and other western writers. Three or four out of the five episodes in this first series were written and in some cases directed by Peckinpah. None are simple good guy/bad guy stories, and the acting as well as the scripts are above average.",995068800,5,359,4.714285714285714

Not sure why.  Would not expect this from such an old program.  I did not read the description closely.  If I had I would have noticed ""run time 73 minutes"", which would have told me not many episodes.

721215,5,6303861377,"Was okay, but wish there were more episodes included.

721278,4,6303861377,"I like the series and still watch it a lot.  It was well done as were many shows of that era.  The one problem I have with old Lucas is that he is always meddling in other people's business--setting things ""right.""  I guess that is to be expected of such a character, but it did get thick sometimes.  I love rifles (and have several myself), but that damn rifle seems to be his security blanket--he can't step into the next room without it.  Another little problem is his body count.  He's always teaching Mark values, but manages to kill about six men a week.",1325721600,,560,4.336538461538462

721280,1,6303861377,"If you are just looking for a few random episodes, this DVD is peachy. However, the episodes you get are apparently different depending on which Rifleman Volume 1 DVD they decide send you - will you get 3 or 4 episodes? Which episodes will they be?... Who knows. Good luck.

This DVD was supposed to have 4 episodes: ""The Sharpshooter"", ""The Marshall"", ""End of a Young Gun"" & ""Home Ranch"", two of which written by Sam Peckinpah. Those are on the OTHER Rifleman Volume 1 - which is the one I ordered. But what is really on the disk I received is 3 episodes: ""Mail Order Groom"", ""The Outlaw's Inheritance"", & ""Day of the Hunter"".

Looking through the customer reviews, there are reviews from people who got the 3-episode disk, as well as the 4-episode disk, and then one review from someone who got 5 episodes! Ridiculous. Apparently, somewhere in the system, there is a drunk monkey randomly assigning which Volume 1 you will get. Just be aware, you might not get what you think you are getting.

I wanted 4 episodes & got 3. If you want the 3, you might get the 4. If anyone wants to swap, let me know.",1324252800,23,1102,4.41871921182266

It would have been nice to have a few more of the shows for the price, and don't know who selected the three, they are okay but none that I remembered.  Plus the transfer is grainy and lined.
