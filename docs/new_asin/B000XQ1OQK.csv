Shot in black and white with a tight focus and odd angles, everything in the film is distorted, including the voice of the narrator, who interviewed Lucretia a number of times before her final disappearance.

According to Lucretia, she, and all other girls ""properly named"" Lucretia are cursed by the witch Latimer. They are immortal, but doomed to die a horrible death, over and over again. Each time they are reborn, they lose their memories, but glimmers slowly come back to them, making it impossible for Lucretias to tell reality from a past reality. They are driven mad by this, and by the knowledge of their impending, terrifying death. This time around, though, Lucretia has a plan. If she can kill the witch Latimer, she believes the curse will be broken, and Lucretias will be allowed to live a normal life and die a natural death.

As this narrative unfolds, we watch a grim montage of loosely connected images of Lucretia going about her plotting. She spends her time in a barn that is filled with all manner of weapons, manacles, tools, and other gruesome implements. Lucretia's symptoms are worsening as her rebirth draws near, and her hallucinations become part of the montage.

The Rebirth of Lucretia is bizarre, surrealistic, and disjointed...and indescribably satisfying. The story is unique and holds together despite the odd telling and use of loosely connected visuals. The enigma of Lucretia is mesmerizing.",1293580800,,1536,4.9921875
