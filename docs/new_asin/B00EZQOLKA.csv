5959382,3,B00EZQOLKA,"Since Bridesmaids, arguably Melissa McCarthy has been one of the funniest comedians period. For not only does she know how to say vulgar and hilarious things, but her style of physical comedy perhaps hasn't been seen since maybe when Chris Farley was alive. Unfortunately though, Tammy seems like it maybe one of McCarthys first real disappointments.

Characters & Story

Imagine getting fired from your job, finding your husband Greg (Nat Faxon) is cheating with your neighbor Missi (Toni Collette), and you no longer have a car to get away from everything. Well, that is how we are introduced to Tammy (Melissa McCarthy). Someone who you don't really feel sorry for at first. For on the shallow end of things, Tammy comes off like most of McCarthys characters since Bridesmaids in which she plays what almost seems like the major negative stereotypes of heavyset people. However, as with most of her films, she turns it around by humanizing the character. For this tale, the main one who helps her do so is Tammys grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon), as well as Pearls cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates). Together, while Tammy certainly doesnt change overnight, they help Tammy face this sorry life she has and try to inspire her to make it better. Even if it requires a road trip from hell.

Praise

To be quite honest, I was surprised at how funny Susan Sarandon could be. Not that I think she is a square, but her acting, at least in movies Ive seen her in, never made her seem like she could be consistently funny. But, then again, in the movie she plays an old alcoholic. And while she is nowhere near Betty Whites level of using her age to make situations funny, she does get quite a few good laughs in, especially when it comes to Pearl having sex with Earl (Gary Cole).

As for McCarthy, admittedly the best parts were in the trailer. But, there are still a few moments not in the trailer which will give you a chuckle. For the most part though, it seems like McCarthy, who wrote Tammy with her husband, was more so trying to develop the character than make Tammy someone trying to deliver joke after joke. For while Tammy certainly is a mess, in more ways than one, throughout the film we more so are treated in trying to get to the root of Tammys issues rather than watching McCarthy and Sarandon try to give birth to a Thelma and Louise inspired film.

Criticism

I must say though, in the pursuit of trying to make her character serious, this leads to a lot of boring moments in which I was checking to see if the film was close to the end of its running time. For one, as noted, the best moments are in the trailer and what is left over will certainly not make you laugh that hard. Also, some of the jokes McCarthy has in the film go on too long and are so bad that Id argue they should have been cut.

Then, when it comes to the story, it does feel a bit aimless for quite some time, even with us knowing the plan is going to Niagara Falls ultimately. But the true root of the films issues, I feel, are because McCarthy isn't at that place yet in her career where she can really, consistently, humanize a character while balancing out the fact they are supposed to be funny. Which perhaps is the main pitfall of McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone writing, and Falcone directing, this film. For when it comes to films McCarthy has been in thus far, you can see that those involved knew how to utilize her talents. But with McCarthy being so close to this film, you can see she is more so giving the people what she thinks they want, while trying to mix in her own ideas into the production. Neither of which turns out well for both the story and jokes were subpar when it comes to what you expect out of McCarthy.

Overall: TV Viewing

Quite honestly, even though I laughed 35 times, they were all weak Ellen DeGeneres sort of chuckles. It was rare for a joke to not feel like something recycled from McCarthys past movies, and Id argue this movie was more so made for people to see the characters she played in the past with more detail than her really looking to write something original. So, with that said, Im definitely saying this is a TV Viewing type film. For not only is it disappointing, but it really does make me question if McCarthy should ever write her own material again.",1404518400,,4296,4.461146496815287
5959383,5,B00EZQOLKA,"Don't compare this to Bridesmaids because that movie wasn't even funny. If you don't appreciate Her humor and crudeness, then don't go to this movie. I thought it was hysterical, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. I didn't see a character in this movie that wasn't funny. I would definitely plan on seeing this again!",1404518400,8,326,4.637931034482759
5959384,1,B00EZQOLKA,"I went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy full of hilarious hijinx with Tammy and her grandmother.  Of course, none of this happened.  This had to be the lamest road trip anyone has ever taken in a movie.  There were so many pointless scenes devoid of any humor.  Tammy did change over the course of the movie, becoming a more serious and respectful person........and maybe that was the point of the movie........to see Tammy evolve...... too bad we had to watch 1.5 hours of crap to get to see it happen.

People walked out of the theater.  That should tell you how great it was.",1404432000,2,593,4.394495412844036
5959385,1,B00EZQOLKA,"In the few years since Bridesmaids catapulted her to stardom with a surprising Best Supporting Actress nomination, Melissa McCarthy has made the absolute best of it. Always a funny and talented actress relegated to supporting roles, she's now having projects designed specifically for her and they've all been huge hits thus far. But Tammy is her first chance to indulge in a true passion project, one she's been developing for years with her co-writer and director husband, Ben Falcone. Essentially a road movie it gives McCarthy the chance to do pretty much the exact same thing she's been doing in exactly the same way, and it makes one wonder why this was such a big deal project for her in the first place.

Maybe a good place to start is the titular character, a lumbering tangled mess of sorrow and rage, like so much of what McCarthy has done before. Was there not even a hint of desire to do something....new? Different? Tammy is suffering one of those abysmal days that often launch this type of comedy of the spirit, one we know will end with insights and epiphanies galore. Having lost her terrible job at a fast food joint (Falcone plays her overbearing boss) because she was late after hitting a deer in the road and totaling the car, Tammy comes home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) having an affair with the neighbor (Toni Collette, given zero to do). Basically everything that can go wrong does can wrong, so trudging over to her parents' (Allison Janney and Dan Akroyd) home, which is like one door down and was probably meant to be a joke but isn't funny, Tammy just wants to get out of town. Fortunately, so does her boozing grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon), and with a wad of cash and grandma's car they decide to hit the road for a journey both literal and emotional.

By this point Tammy has probably fallen flat on her face, crashed into something, or caused some sort of wreckage at least a dozen times until it becomes obvious this is the extent of the humor, and it grows tiresome very fast. Maybe it's the relative inexperience of Falcone as a director and the pair as writers but they do a terrible job of sketching out Tammy's world and the relationships she shares. What they do is portray Tammy as something of a half-wit who hasn't heard of Mark Twain and lacks any shred of social grace. She's mean, aggressive, and generally disagreeable to the point that it's hard to feel anything for her, and the script isn't crafted well enough to change our perception of Tammy no matter how hard it tries. So what we get is essentially lip service to a troubled upbringing, and some brief altercations with Pearl that hint at something deeper. But there's no commitment to any of it, in favor of getting to the next ridiculous set piece where McCarthy can pull whatever stunt she can think of. She's a funny lady but with only Sarandon to play off of you can sense McCarthy struggling to come up with something to do that might get a laugh. So we get numerous overlong and laugh-free scenes where McCarthy labors to kill time: one in which she sings nearly all of the Allman Brothers' ""Midnight Rider"", and another where she dances unprovoked to hip-hop because....well, that's never really made clear. It just kind of happens. That's probably the best way to sum up Tammy as a whole: it just kind of happens.

By the time a love interest is introduced (played by the utterly wasted Mark Duplass), it feels like an afterthought and considering his character's lack of personality it probably was. We're at a loss to figure out what Tammy's drive or motivation is meant to be, and any lessons learned only come when, you guessed it, after the slovenly Tammy gets a physical makeover. Even as she gets some hard words of wisdom from her lesbian aunt (Kathy Bates), it never really registers as meaningful because Tammy just goes on doing what she's been doing, which makes us wonder what this was about other than lazy and predictable slapstick. If you guessed there might be a stint in jail for Tammy at one point then you are a winner!

So what was the draw for McCarthy to do a movie like Tammy in the first place? Obviously there's an appeal to developing her own movie when Hollywood isn't always so forthcoming, but there's a real missed opportunity here for McCarthy to show what she's really capable of.",1404345600,24,4336,4.619974059662775
5959386,5,B00EZQOLKA,"I'm not sure why people are putting this movie down. My family came
away happy, my son is still mentioning how funny it was.

I won't go into detail like most, all I will say is that the whole
theater was laughing hard and loud throughout most of the movie, which
is what most people want when they go see a comedy, to laugh NOT think.

For those that already know Melissa McCarthy, you know what to expect
and you will not be disappointed. Add Susan and Kathy and I don't see
how you can go wrong. I really think people are putting too many
expectations on this.

If you don't know Melissa McCarthy then you must live under a rock lol.
But still it is funny so just enjoy it like my whole family did!",1404259200,121,701,4.139705882352941
5959387,3,B00EZQOLKA,"There isn't a movie star out there right now who I love more than Melissa McCarthy. Her unique brand of take-no-prisoners comedy can be a truly remarkable thing. But just because an actor is as good as McCarthy is, does that mean that she should start writing her own material? In the case of her latest feature attraction, Tammy, the answer, unfortunately, is no.

Tammy (McCarthy) is a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her clunker car is totaled because of a suicidal deer, her husband is cheating on her and her nasty boss fires her after being late from work for a totally legitimate reason. Needing to get out of town, and needing a reset button pressed on her life, Tammy embarks on a road trip to who-knows-where with her heavy-drinking grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon.)

""Tammy"" has a pedigree to die for - so many great actresses - McCarthy, Sarandon, Kathy Bates, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Sandra Oh, and it only uses about half of them. Collette, Oh and Janney have barely anything to do, each of them only appearing in a few scenes, and mainly in thankless roles. Dan Aykroyd, Gary Cole and Mark Duplass also have supporting (mostly thankless) roles.

""Tammy"" tries to be two kinds of movies - the hilarious over-the-top comedies that McCarthy has become known for, and a soulful, poignant character study. Im not going to say this attempt failed, because I truly enjoyed spending time in the world of Tammys character. But I wish it would have stuck to one of those archetypes.

The second one. McCarthys great in comedies like Bridesmaids and The Heat, but her fanbase, and audiences everywhere, deserve to see that she can be a very good dramatic actress, if the material calls for it. I know she can do it, because she makes the dramatic and sensitive moments in this film work. But the script itself is kind of all over the place.

McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone wrote the film. Their effort doesnt fail, by any means, but I just wish Tammy had a better idea of what it wanted to be. Like all of us, Tammys character is full of questions about what the future has in store for her. So, it makes sense for Tammy to be uneven.

Theres one bit of miscasting that I need to address - Susan Sarandon plays McCarthys grandmother. Sarandon is 24 years older than McCarthy. Shes game in a gray wig and old age makeup, but one must wonder - was Betty White not available? Sarandon seems like an odd choice, not just because of her age, but because she never really seems comfortable with comedy. McCarthy carries more on her shoulders than she should need to, with a cast this talented. Alas, she guides the movie through occasional narrative bumps in the road effortlessly.

In the end, Tammy is no vanity piece for McCarthy. Its half poignant character study and half typical R-rated comedy. Its all over the place, but thats not a consistent negative. Even with the contrivances of the story, McCarthy is immensely appealing and charismatic all the way through.

Grade: B",1404259200,7,3005,4.667296786389414
5959388,2,B00EZQOLKA,"For more of my reviews head over to: www.thescreencave.com

From Director Ben Falcone comes an adventure comedy as Melissa McCarthy (Tammy) who gets fired form her job and then loses her husband, sets out to love and find herself before its too late. As she travels with her diabetic grandmother on the road to Niagara Falls, Tammy struggles to make ends meet. But when she meets a stranger at a bar, soon she will realize that being happy from within is the key to her success.

Going back to Bridesmaids back in 2009, Melissa McCarthy stormed onto the big screen and would go on to be a major hit. After recently being in the movies: The Heat and Identity Thief, McCarthy would make a name for herself for her energetic and zany performances. Only this time she teams up with Susan Surandon, grandma Pearl, to help deal with their ailing issues. Their chemistry was great as was the rest of the cast; including an appearance by Kathy Bates, who has a touching moment with Tammy when things seem to be at their worst.

The movie sort of reminds me of a time when Zach Galifianakis did The Hangover, and from the success of it, went on to make Due Date there after. In the film, he was raunchy and unfavorable as the movie progressed. Same can be said here as McCarthy rules the screen but her character is just too unlikeable to begin with. From the time she did Bridesmaids, her character was strange but had a likability to her that was balanced amongst the rest of her companions. Its disappointing to see this actress be utilized to the lowest extent because of the amount of talent and enthuse she brings onscreen.

Again, bringing up Susan Sarandon and her role in the film was amazing. I really enjoyed her character even with all the baggage she carried in her life. As Tammy and Pearl were on their road trip it almost felt like a Thelma and Louise adventure that brings back memories from back in the day. Tammys mom, Deb, played by Allison Janney was good; however I would have liked to have seen her more.

In the end, the film barely has a plot and is driven by McCarthys antics that cheats the movie from having a better story. A great cast is there but aren't treated well with the script. There are sporadic moments of laughter and fun that mostly take place in the first half of the film. By the end of the movie it tries to be serious and have a resolution but you never quite get the feel of it.",1404259200,4,2415,4.417977528089888

I watched this on a whim and wasn't disappointed - it has some moments you sort of have to eye-roll your way through, but all and all it has some HILARIOUS bits and a bit of a running theme that's heartwarming in the end.

5959469,1,B00EZQOLKA,"This movie is a rip-off of the movie ""Grandma"" which is so much better.

This movie was not at all funny.  I saw a few opportunities for jokes, but the movie missed them.

Tammy is beyond stupid.  We are supposed to believe that she never heard of Mark Twain?

I love Kathy Bates, and she was really good in this movie, and so my one star goes totally to her.

SPOILER ALERT.....
The sudden happy ending for this movie was pathetic.  We are supposed to believe that this loser turned her life around completely (but we don't get to know exactly how that happened).  She ends up living in her own apartment - - how is she paying rent - - she said at the end that she had a job, but I would like to know what kind of a job she could get that could pay enough for her to live alone (with experience in a fast-food dump and with a criminal record).  Why would she let her cheating husband get the house?  She ends up in a relationship with that guy, which is unbelievable.  And, of course, her cheating husband gets cheated on and dumped.  The happy ending was ridiculous - - it would have been a believable ending if she just had a conversation with someone at the end, talking about her goals, and then the credits should have rolled.",1490659200,,1232,4.217948717948718

So with all that, what could go wrong?...........in this dud: EVERYTHING.
The script did not have one effective joke in it. Sarandon apparently didn't get paid, because she clearly didn't care to participate. Her character is so unlikable, you're actually disappointed she's still alive. Either that or Sarandon's humorless. McCarthy and Bates' wasted talents are almost tragic to watch.

It seems to have very little purpose, except being an ""A day in the live of..."" Well, not an actual day but several months.

Tammy appears to be the female loser. She's separated from her husband who has his girlfriend move in to take her place; she has an alcoholic grandmother who's been arrested for buying drugs...she robs a fast food place get the money for Grandma's bail in one of the most ludicrous and inept robberies in history, then returns the money at Grandma's orders, in a second even more ridiculous return-the-loot scenes.

5959581,2,B00EZQOLKA,"A great cast could not overcome a dull script. Random, ill developed characters popping in and out of a storyline that was all over the place. If we laughed more than a couple of times I'd be surprised.
I guess you could call it a drama-dy but it fails at either. A silent theater during a Melissa McCarthy comedy? Say it ain't so! Oh wait...we did laugh .... At my husband groaning about how awful it was. Sad because I was looking forward to this one. I give it 2 rather than 1 just because it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I would advise waiting for an out of theater option if you feel you must see this because you love Melissa. It's pretty disappointing.",1474243200,,673,4.265625

I was afraid of seeing a Dumb and Dumber movie, but there was a better plot, and a better message, and a not so happy but happy ending with a moral to the story. So I enjoyed it. Could have done without the F bomb and sexual undertones, but it made it funny. I liked the acting of both main characters and the scenes of Kathy Bates (a fav of mine).

Sure, it has funny moments and there are some pretty good laughs. But, this movie does not rate as a true comedy. Okay, it has some emotional, true-life situations but they are intertwined in a crazy like plot. I was waiting for either some heart-felt dramatic ending or some outrageous comedic finale. I was pretty disappointed since the movie tried to mix the comedy with some, so-called, happy ending. I think the final outtakes made this movie more worth watching to the end.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is I love Kathy Bates and Susan Sarandon and now Melissa McCarthy as a talented actor.",1468195200,,751,4.604477611940299

5959757,4,B00EZQOLKA,"Low four, High Five.
I watched this movie thinking it would be a typical Melissa McCarthy movie- lots of swearing, a wild and crazy ride and not much substance.
I have to agree with others who rated this low in that regard- If you are looking for a low subtsance, crazy wild ride kind of movie- this is not the one for you.

In Tammy Melissa McCarthy shows her ability to play someone who needs help, needs to grow up, needs to own her own problems. She travels from a seemingly spoiled little girl to an adult. This movie also tackles problems like alcoholism and touches on issues of families, divorce, etc.
There is some humor but it is limited.

I really enjoyed this movie. I would watch it again but it is not my favorite. The whining and drama at the start was a bit much for me.

Was it the best movie I've ever seen?  No, not at all.  But there were quite a few really great moments.  Susan Sarandon played Tammy's grandmother.  Sarandon is an outstanding actress in my opinion, and she gave another wonderful performance in this movie as the grandmother that .

5959927,4,B00EZQOLKA,"I think the main problem with this film's rating, as listed, stems from a lack of clarity in the way this movie is presented.
I confess, I had assumed that this would be some sort of 'fried green tomatoes' chick flick (it's just the term that best matches my incorrect assumption!)...  to watch the trailer, you would think it is some sort of thug gangster white chick version of Ice Cube's 'Friday'...  (again, just speaking in conceptual shorthand)

The pleasant surprise for me was in finding out it is far more reminiscent of a sort of John Candy movie comedy that I always enjoy...  I found myself thinking of the Candy/Martin classic 'Planes Trains and Automobiles'...

In true modern style, it does feature more foul language than was usual at that time, but I was reminded of similar amounts of sexual content, in the same spirit...  and I couldn't help but think that the participation of Dan Aykroid was something of an endorsement...  if the inclusion of so many notable actors wasn't already significant!

As a single guy in his 30s, I did not expect to like it as much as I did.

It made me laugh many times, from start to finish. I felt I got my money's worth. I didn't feel I'd wasted the time I spent in the seat.

Perhaps the most succinct review I can give it is to say that ""Tammy"" deserves to be ranked somewhere between ""The Hangover"" and ""The Hangover II.""",1440115200,,633,4.319327731092437

5959973,3,B00EZQOLKA,"Tammy
 Fans of Melissa McCarthy hopefully waited for Tammy to hit the big screen, funny bones eager to be tickled.  Comic actress McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone had total creative control of this film.  The husband and wife team wrote the script.  Melissa of course took the starring role of the overweight Tammy who discovers her husbands affair and flees town.  Falcone and McCarthy also produced the film.  And husband Ben Falcone directed, which pretty much sews up the entire creative process between the pair of talented entertainment professionals.  Fans quite properly expected something extraordinary.
 They received something only middling, a great disappointment.  We wanted wet-your- pants laughter but got only giggles and the occasional snort.
 The utterly dysfunctional Tammy gets fired from her fast food job, hits a deer and has her car clunk out on her.  We call that sort of thing a bad day.  But when she comes home she finds than her husband has made a lovely lunch for the neighbor lady, a considerate and caring act that he never bothered to award her with.
 She escapes town with her alcoholic grandmother and several thousand of grannies dollars and embarks on a road trip of self discovery as she transitions from a self centered trauma magnet into something close to a functioning adult.  I found the story always interesting and watchable.  Some truths came into focus that anyone could appreciate.  But the laughs came too slowly and too infrequently.  We can get philosophy from Woody Allen.  We want laughs from Melissa McCarthy.
 McCarthys stock in trade is the put upon, beaten down, zero self esteem overweight and often none too clever woman who by the end of the film has some sort of a redemptive experience.  Ok, all well and good, but we have seen this unroll several times in a row now.  Perhaps the whole idea now leaves the audience unrewarded, a tired trope in need of renewal.
 McCarthys co-stars are a problem also.  She is on screen with both Kathy Bates and Susan Sarandon who play her aunt and her grandmother respectively.  McCarthy in the past has produced the laughter that we crave in a comedy motion picture.  But putting her up against two Oscar winners (Bates for Misery; Sarandon for Dead Man Walking) some would find unfair but all find a bit jarring.
 Ben Falcone has a tiny role, as is his custom in his wifes films.  Dan Aykroyd also has a small role as Tammys estranged father.  In a casual pantomime he also shows his exceptional acting chops.
 Tammy can only muster a below average two and a half saw-blades, disappointing her fans.  The film lasts only one hour and 36 minutes.  The producers allowed $20 million to make the R rated (language, situations) film and should do fine.  Tammy made $36 million at the box office worldwide in the extended 4th of July opening weekend.",1438905600,,2847,4.806185567010309

5960013,1,B00EZQOLKA,"Going in you know Melissa McCarthy plays pretty much the same character every film, a foul mouthed bully who thinks she's morally better than those her character comes across. This one though with the Tammy character turns all those characteristics up to their maximum, and Tammy has no redeeming qualities, there's not even a small part of you hoping for any success for her.  She's like a bottom of the food chain social status young school child, trying to come up with comebacks for those who have put her down (for legitimate reasons most of the time, such as ruining food, or destroying a jet ski) but who just doesn't have the ability for a good verbal comeback, but of this child is in an adult's body.  Teamed up with her grandmother who likes to drink and sleep with anyone she comes across (while Tammy listens in at the rear of the vehicle banging on it, or outside the motel door), there's nothing clever about the plot at all.  This is marketed as a comedy but there really aren't any laughs here.  Give Tammy a miss!",1435622400,,1031,4.526881720430108

5960025,2,B00EZQOLKA,"After becoming the break-out star of Bridesmaids with her puppy hoarding and sink stools, Melissa McCarthy likely had her pick of comedy projects to choose from in the years that followed. Based on the 50/50 track record of those choices, however, its unclear whether she squandered or took full advantage of the boost Bridesmaids offered. For every decent follow-up flick (The Heat and St. Vincent), we get a dud like Identity Thief or Tammy, and the shortcomings of the failures tend to outweigh the highlights of the successes. Case in point: Tammy, the roadtrip comedy co-written by Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone (who also directed), which fails to generate laughs at every stop and which seems to be nothing more than a bunch of poorly executed and written jokes strung together by a very loose premise.

In what might be the films sole funny sequence, Tammy (McCarthy) has the worst day of her life as she totals her car by hitting a deer, loses her job, and then arrives home to discover her husband loves another woman by finding him midway through a meal with another woman. Thats not a euphemism. While the piling on of circumstances is somewhat comical, whats unfunny throughout is McCarthys wholly unlikable character who never once gives us a reason to suspect shes anything other than a loud, obnoxious slob who fully deserves whats coming to her in one form or another. In an act of desperation to get away from it all, Tammy agrees to head out on the road with her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) if thats what it takes to get out of that town (and her life). As the roadtrip progresses, so too does Tammys relationship with her grandmother (who is all at once a good and bad influence).

Despite all the miles they cover, the story and the laughs never go far if anywhere at all. Tammy starts out with four flat tires and try as it might to push itself down the road, its just dead in its tracks and so decides to just indulge in Adam Sandler-esque infantilism until the credits roll. Its not a pretty sight, and its one of the more painfully unfunny comedies to come out in recent memory.

Blu-ray Bonus Features

The combo pack includes the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and as a digital copy, with extras on the Blu-ray ranging from an extended cut of the film, to deleted scenes, to a Tammy roadtrip checklist, and finally a gag reel that just makes things very awkward as its clear the cast and crew were having a laugh riot making the film, but none of that translated to the actual movie.

5960044,1,B00EZQOLKA,I decided to give this movie a chance.  By the time it ended it appeared to me the movie was confused about what it wanted to be.  Trying to be a comedy it completely failed that there was at most one or two funny lines.  If this is supposed to be an actual comedy it has to be one of the worst comedies I've seen and there's been some bad ones.  I've never found McCarthy to be funny in any of her movies.  It seems she tries too hard.  On the drama side of the movie it also fails.  The characters are just not likeable and you don't ever feel sorry for them.  Tammy comes off as a bad representation of a person that's obese and comes across as stupid and angry.  It seems the ending makes all her problems whisked away which is not even an ounce of believability.  McCarthy is just not a good lead for a movie.  At best she is just a part of a group character kind of like one of the friends of the main character.  If you're looking for a decent comedy/drama its best to skip this one.  You won't be missing anything.,1433289600,,1022,4.05

McCarthy veers between surprisingly muted scenes and annoying shrillness, but there are scattered moments when she demonstrates some range as an actress. Sarandon in her role as McCarthy's grandma isn't particularly likable, just sort of pathetic. I'm willing to guess that isn't the sort of effect the filmmakers were reaching for.

5960179,3,B00EZQOLKA,"To be honest, Tammy isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  I was prepared, based on the commercials I've seen for this, to see a total collapse of anything remotely considered interesting/quality storytelling and humor.  Sometimes the movie does venture down this unforgiveable road unfortunately, such as whenever Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon deliberately screw up singing (more like mocking) a classic Allman Brothers Band tune, the scene where Melissa's rolling over a countertop during a robbery attempt which mocks overweight people and should most definitely offend them, and lots of uncreative nonsense and boring cussing parts (like everything in the beginning when Melissa gets fired from the fast food restaurant because of her incompetence/ignorance- every WORD she says here sickens me in its lack of creativity).

However, the movie much to my surprise doesn't *completely* focus on Melissa McCarthy being belligerent and obnoxious all the time.  Even though she's clearly the main character who's not only overweight, but is also very directionless in her life and clueless in how she approaches people, she sometimes comes across as a very well-meaning person when she wants to.  This attribute of her personality saves the movie in my opinion.  Doesn't save the movie enough for me to recommend it, but saves it enough to make it better than I feared.

Basically the story is that Melissa's character and her grandmother played by Susan Sarandon travel around through roadtrips to bars and Niagara Falls, getting involved in parties, accidentally going through with a robbery to save the grandmother in prison, hitting on two different men that both Melissa and her grandmother are attracted to (and the feeling's mutual for Melissa's potential boyfriend interestingly enough- I thought for sure this guy was going to pick apart Melissa and poke fun at her in many different ways, but instead the opposite occurs and he offers support and generosity) and causing all sorts of mischief.

Some of this stuff is surprisingly funny such as the robbery scene at the fast food restaurant.  Melissa places a brown bag over her head to cover her face while pointing something shaped like a gun at the cashier lady while carrying on normal and innocent conversations with her and other employees while obtaining food.  This scene is one of the best I thought.  While other parts are ignorant and disrespectful towards the overweight population.

One thing that bugs me however, is... probably two things.  Make that three.  The film gets worse as it goes along.  The humor gets pushed aside once Kathy Bates enters the picture so a more romantic drama-driven story can develop.  Sorry but Melissa's character isn't likeable enough to illustrate a believable romance, and the same can be said for her equally obnoxious grandmother.  Also Kathy Bates is limited to a very small role, and I seriously strongly dislike her character being treated with such a total lack of respect.  Kathy's an AMAZING actress and deserves better.  I did like the meaningful part where she tells Melissa she needs to get her crap together.  Also I think it's odd how Melissa's mother played by Allison Janney doesn't tag along with Melissa and Susan's character on this little adventure.  I think it would've been better for all three to go on crazy adventures together.

There's other humorous segments too, such as the bar scene and grandma rolling around in a backseat having some fun with a guy, haha.  So gross!  Also Melissa having to sleep outside the hotel room right there on the sidewalk while wild animals walk by is pretty entertaining due to grandma not quite done with the man she met at the bar, and they lock Melissa outside so they can continue their fun and games on top of the hotel bed, hehe.  There's even a pillow and blanket tossed out for Melissa!  How generous!

Overall not a film I'd recommend other than for VERY cheap comedy reasons.  Too much dislikeable characteristics with Melissa McCarthy rub me the wrong way, and would probably downright offend others.  Weak writing and wasting/underutilizing better actresses like Kathy Bates adds to this films misery (hehe, sorry for the pun).",1426723200,6,4217,5.044733044733045

I thought I was going to like it at first but it was just too over the top for me. Being overweight, dumped, having an alcoholic grandma had so much real-life potential to be funny--why add so much unrealistic shock value, crudeness, stupidity and swearing to what could have been a much better movie. Why this character has to destroy two cars and a jet ski - c'mon, really?  Alcoholic grandmas can be embarrassing but that was just too much.

 It's a sad case where a comedy turns into a dramady and becomes a tragedy of a movie. Neither Tammy nor the people  around her are interesting enough to write a movie about.

5960481,2,B00EZQOLKA,"This movie seemed to have a lot going for it - stellar actors and a premise with hilarious possibilities, but almost from the beginning, it took a depressing turn and on top of that, it added a layer of gratuitous vulgarity, particularly from Melissa's character which was totally unnecessary and did nothing to contribute to the development of her character.  We kept watching hoping that the comic elements would eventually win out, but every time the plot provided the opportunity to transition to comedy, it seems that the writers, director, producers, etc. chose instead to focus solely on the most depressing elements in the storyline.  We ended up being terribly disappointed with this film and felt that Melissa McCarthy, Susan Sarandon, Allison Janney, Kathy Bates and just about every other actor in the film was completely squandered on a supremely depressing story.",1422921600,,877,5.169014084507042

5960505,1,B00EZQOLKA,"I was coerced into watching this film (Out numbered).  First, I really like Melissa McCarthy in general, however I found this film to be more sad than humorous. The film lacked a clear purpose (Just a series of random high school 'gags') and the characters appeared to be without motivation or direction. At one point, I was convinced there was not actually a written script for this movie, just ad-lib and improvisation along the lines of, ""Let's turn on the cameras and see what happens"". Honestly, I could not explain what I had just seen, nor describe the intended 'plot' of the movie to someone else.",1422489600,2,605,4.7075471698113205
5960506,2,B00EZQOLKA,"If you are into Melissa McCarthy and her schtick, you may like this.  I'm on the fence generally with her films.  I think she is funny, but the movies themselves tend to be a drag.  This is no exception.  I get a sense that she does alot of impromptu riffing with her co-stars.  As much as I hate to do it, I think I have to give Sandra Bullock a compliment...apparently, Sandra could hang with Melissa making Heat watchable (barely...it's a stinker too).  However, Susan Sarandon doesn't appear to be able to improv at all.  All jokes fall flat quickly, instead of the typical back and forth you see McCarthy engage in.

Tammy, my God, why have you made me compliment Sandra Bullock???  WHY????

Anyways, it's a dud.  My wife was kind enough to grant me permission to turn this off about 2/3 through.  She watches Kardashians for God's sake and even she found this mind-numbing.  The good news for this movie is that we got ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" after.  Suddenly this movie looked like Citizen Kane.  That's how it got the 2nd star...by virtue of it not being that rotten McFarlane film.  Wow.  It's awful.  But enough about me...watch Tammy if you have an aching for subpar comedy.",1422489600,,1197,4.514018691588785

I SO dislike all the cursing, it just looks like a angry robust woman who has no self control... Did I mention that I hated it. Keep it clean, Hollywood!

Other than, perhaps, Susan Sarandon, none added much to the movie and I would assume all would be embarrassed to admit they were in it.

She's excellent in this bad movie, she's on FIRE in a great movie. I'd rather see her in excellent projects she doesn't develop with her husband, or that they develop with the input of a more experienced team- this WAS their first project. Sorry, Melissa. You know I love you, girl!

Maybe with more experienced hands, their next project will be more assured. I'd watch MM read the phone book. But not twice.",1419984000,,683,4.544715447154472

5960850,2,B00EZQOLKA,There were a few laughs... But the problem was they made thick girls seem disgusting and white trash and essentially unlovable. The movie gave the leading man nothing to like about her and yet she was having to convince him they would not work. Crazy!! I was so disappointed! Melissa normally does such a beautiful funny job but they went to gross with her character that she really could not recover. And then at the end they would not even do an up close kiss shot??? Why because they didn't really kiss and like everything else in the film it came across fake. I was just totally disappointed......,1419984000,,601,4.574074074074074

First off Susan Sarandon didn't fly as the old grandma! The whole this was a bit all over the place, and strangely a bit dark at times.
This movie had it's moments of being funny, but somehow didn't pull together too well.
I give it 3 stars because of Ms. McCarthy's talent. Susan Sarandon it amazing even if the role wasn't quite right for her. You just have to love her!",1419897600,,526,4.489583333333333

5960979,2,B00EZQOLKA,"I love Melissa and I find most of her films pretty funny. This is because she's a natural comedian. There's just something hilarious about the way she delivers lines.

I read many reviews and they say it is more ""sad"" than funny. Spoiler alert. It is because Tammy starts the movie off being cheated on by her husband, fired from her job and her car broke down and non fixable. so there you have it, the reason the people find this movie ""sad""but it stil has fun to it and or a good watch.",1418947200,,359,4.0

I kept wondering why name it/her 'Tammy' after the classic films about the naive country girl played best by Sandra Dee.  Was someone trying to make a statement about human preconceptions?

It's debatable whether the film is a comedy with dramatic elements or a drama with comic elements.  I side with the latter.  Melissa McCarthy is a smart intuitive actress who's playing for keeps.  In ""Tammy"" she departs from the abrasive types she's played in films like ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" and portrays a character who is more vulnerable and sad.  The fragility shown by McCarthy demonstrates growth on her part as an artist and defies the stereotypes that are placed on actors of certain body types.  McCarthy is abetted here by Susan Sarandon in a terrific turn as Tammy's randy alcoholic grandmother.  This is a good part for Sarandon who like McCarthy mines the pathos of the character.  McCarthy co-wrote the script with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed.  If this is the end result of their working together McCarthy and Falcone should collaborate more in the future.",1418515200,23,1230,4.985294117647059

Granted it was funny but not that gut wrenching laugh out loud belly ache laugh that you find with a really good comedy.  I must admit though that this movie did play my emotions pretty well.  I did do some crying in spots.

Melissa McCarthy is truly funny and does a good job at what she does but I just think the script held her back some on this storyline.  She was however more than convincing in the sad parts and you just can't help reaching for that Kleenex.  Tammy was very much well worth watching just for it's comedy that was done and for the intense play of emotions.  If you like comedy, watch this.

5961330,5,B00EZQOLKA,"I'm sixty-five.  I have always hated slob humor.  I think the Three Stooges are stupid and most of the popular ""comedies"" aren't.  I didn't even like cartoons as a kid.  I've worked in L.A. theater all my life and people call me a ""stage snob"" because I believe most of the talent is on the stage rather than the screen.  But.  I love Melissa!

This girl has timing and talent oozing from every pore.  Her physical comedy is remarkable.  And whether she's doing comedy or drama, you feel for her character.  You understand why she blows air into the deer's nose.  You get why she runs from Grandma Pearl after being insulted.  You GET her ... she's human and real.

After spending decades watching elitist movies, I've just fallen in love with Tammy.  When I get angry or depressed, I put this film in the DVD player and Melissa and the rest of the wonderful cast just suck me in.

Tammy does not deliver on that level.  Great cast including Susan Sarandon, Kathy Bates, Alison Janney, Dan Aykroyd and Gary Cole as the heavy hitters.  The plot gets a little too serious without becoming a black comedy which takes away from the potential humor factor.  Excellent acting, entertaining film, but bad script and mediocre directing.

I've liked Melissa McCarthy since the Gilmore girls, and Bridesmaids was hilarious, but I really didn't care for her last two movies. They seemed too scripted instead of letting her do her own improvisation maybe? This movie seemed to bring back the hilarity that so many of us loved in Bridesmaids. It is also just heartwarming enough without being too cheesy, and there's a cute romantic twist. Also, it's always so much fun seeing Melissa's real life husband.

One such message (which can be mentioned without spoiling the story) is that women can really move away from the self-hating image of the Barbie doll. It is also genuinely funny in places.
 At times however I found it hard to buy into the story; it was just too far-fetched. A better job by the writers would have made the whole movie more authentic and its messages more powerful.",1417478400,,499,4.659090909090909

5961593,2,B00EZQOLKA,"Melissa McCarthy is generally good in her films.  However, this is an exception.  ""Tammy"" has no plot.  It is a collection of disjointed scenes depicting Tammy and her drunken grandmother getting into trouble.  For the most part, a lot of time is spent watching the grandmother get drunk, hook up with an old guy in a bar, or talk about drinking or past sexual encounters.  It's pretty dull.

There are a few jokes that play off McCarthy being a big woman.  It was slightly funny seeing her stand up to her fast food boss and hold up a similar fast food restaurant.  That said, the humor was really predictable -- almost to the point of being annoying.

Overall -- the movie could have benefitted from tying the plot together better, editing out extraneous scenes involving Tammy's ex-husband, and including some funnier scenes that are not just drunken escapades (i.e. Harold and Kumar is a good example of how to weave together disparate plot elements).

I would avoid this movie.  Do not rent or buy just because you think that McCarthy will make the movie funny.",1417219200,8,1066,4.708108108108108

This isn't a movie I would watch again. Once was enough and I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it.

5961781,2,B00EZQOLKA,"Tammy,"" starring Melissa McCarthy, is a road trip geared to showcase the actress willingness to go to any lengths to get a laugh. When Tammy is having a tough day, she gathers her belongings and trudges two houses away to her Moms (Allison Janney), where she pours out her problems and eagerness to get out of town. In the next room, Grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) overhears the commotion and is already packed. She has a car and a bankroll, and together the women strike out for brighter opportunities.

The two traveling companions make numerous stops, where they encounter an assortment of colorful folks and get themselves into one predicament after another. Pearls drinking attracts trouble and Tammys aggressive manner puts people off. They are the perfect nightmare on wheels.

Co-written by Ms. McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone, Tammy becomes a retread of McCarthys antics from previous and better films, such as Bridesmaids and Identity Thief. The script doesnt live up to McCarthys talents. For a comedy, its unfortunately short on laughs. The picture rests largely on her shoulders and the burden might be too great. With such pros as Allison Janney and Kathy Bates on hand, some of the comedy should have been spread around.

Ms. Sarandon is entirely miscast as Pearl. A phony grey wig and raunchiness make her drunken rantings and awkwardly flirtatious escapades more pathetic than funny. A heavy-drinking, promiscuous senior citizen palling around with her neer-do-well granddaughter may have seemed hysterical, but script, actors, and director cant breathe comic life into the premise.

The Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a gag reel, digital HD copy, deleted scenes, and a featurette that follows Melissa McCarthy and director Ben Falcone on a real-life cross-country adventure.",1416787200,2,1794,5.2622377622377625
