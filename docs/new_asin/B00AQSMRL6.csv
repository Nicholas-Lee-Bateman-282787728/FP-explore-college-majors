8556604,5,B00AQSMRL6,"If you're looking at this set, I'm going to assume you already know what Ranma 1/2 is. Considering the price point, I can't imagine a non-fan is browsing this entry!

What we have here is a Japanese import featuring the first 54 episodes of Ranma 1/2 in crystal clear high definition. This is the first of three box sets that the distributor intends to release in Japan. While I do not own the set myself -- nearly $500 is way too rich for my blood -- I've seen footage from the episodes, and I've seen a number of side-by-side comparison shots with the various DVD and VHS versions that have come before.

A lot of time has clearly gone into the production of this set. The interlacing issues that are present on the old region 1 DVDs is gone, the color timing has been adjusted to offer warmer, more naturalistic tones, and the aspect ratio has been corrected. The picture quality is really astounding!

Having said that, I now come to the main reason I'm writing this: if you're thinking of forking over nearly half a grand to import this thing, maybe you should wait. Viz Media -- the company who originally released Ranma 1/2 in the United States -- recently announced that they will be reissuing Ranma 1/2 on both DVD and Blu-ray beginning in 2014. Presumably these new sets will utilize the new HD masters, and considering Viz will probably break the show up into seasons as opposed to the three lump-sum box sets being released in Japan, the price point is likely to be a lot more user-friendly.

So be patient. 2014 sees the return of everyone's favorite gender-swapping martial artist and his group of wacky friends. It's never been a better time to be a fan of Ranma 1/2!
