8361896,2,B000CBRX8Y,"As a fan of John Femia, I was thrilled when I came across this rarity online.  I paid a small amount of money for it...and let me just say that I am glad I only spent what I did.  This movie (an afterschool special of sorts, I believe) is not particularly good at all.  It focuses on the Henderson family, who have recently inherited an island that is on the US/Canadian border but has not been claimed by either country.  A reporter erroneously states that they are the ""royal family"" of this ""nation"", and...madness ensues.  The problem with this film lies not in the perfomances of the actors, however, who all did a noble job with what little good story they had to work with.  The entire premise for the film is absolutely absurd, and its 45 minute length does not allow for development of any kind.  Each event that takes place seems forced to happen in order to resolve the story, and none of it is believable.  Collectors may be interested in buying this because of a post ""Pegs"" performance from Sarah Jessica Parker, as well as the equally talented but far less noted John Femia.  But for pure entertainment value, it's best to look elsewhere than here.",1158710400,,1163,4.526315789473684
