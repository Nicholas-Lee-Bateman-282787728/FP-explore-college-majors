7902548,5,B000003K7A,"""The Jem'Hadar"" stands as one of DS9's most intense episodes, introducing the viewers to the one-dimensional ""policemen"" of the Founders in the form of the title characters and the conniving and sinister Vorta. Both would be a staple for the duration of the show's run.
The kamikaze attack during the installment's final minutes still remains one of the most shocking scenes in Trek history.",1050364800,,391,5.125

At this point you know its going to be one big old treat to see just what happens on this so called science project for Jake and Nog. Ha! You know your about to get some scientific laughs outta this one ... Then Sisko says the coolest thing"" lets get going before anyone else shows up"" Ha! And zoom thru the wormhole they go! As soon as they land on the planet Sisko is singing the blues having to deal with a good idea gone bad and poor Quark is covering his lobes in some green goo...something about he is allergic to nature! ha! Then a little time passes, darkness falls and O NO! A campfire scene, it might not be row, row, row your boat material, ha! In reference to Star Trek: 5 with Bones and Captain Kirk trying to teach Spock an old earth song, but its funny enough seeing old Quark complaining about bugs and bad food and getting himself caught on fire! Suddenly bad gets worse...THE JEM'HADAR! Captain Sisko and Quark are taken as prisoners, Jake and Nog take over a shuttle and its funny to see those two taking command.. You would swear Jake had been into a case of Romulan Ale with his horrific flying. The tension builds rapidly because of certain events that take place at DS9 and the present situation of Captain Sisko and company. DS9 to the rescue, but at what cost? Jailbreaks, starship fights the action builds! What will happen? Set a course for this episode a must see for any Star Trek fan !",984441600,3,1489,4.340501792114695
7902550,5,B000003K7A,"This episode centres around Sisko and Quark and how they are forced into camping together on a lonely planet, a comical account that really kicks  into high gear when an alien with a personal cloaking device emerges from  the trees and reveals himself as a Jem'hadar. Sisko, Quark, Nog and Jake  are kept in a prison camp surrounded by a deadly forcefield, in there they  encounter another trapped individual who reveals fascinating information  about the Jem'hadar and a powerful new force... brilliant!",966643200,,504,5.097560975609756
7902551,5,B000003K7A,"This episode starts like any other slow, character driven episode and ends with awesome action and a new 'bad guy' to menace the Federation!  This finally shows the rumored Dominion who then became one of the more  interesting enimies in Star Trek lore.",941846400,,253,4.8604651162790695
