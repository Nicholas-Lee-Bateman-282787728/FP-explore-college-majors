1330827,5,B00003ETMM,"I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SILK MANNING HAS MORE VIDEOS AVAILABLE.
I NEED AN INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCE TAPE. PLEASE NOTIFY ME VIA EMAIL.  STEPHANIE",1024876800,2,143,4.72
1330828,3,B00003ETMM,"There are no suggestions in this video to avoid injury (e.g. on deep bends, don't let your knees extend beyond your toes), and you can't just rewind the dvd by individual sections if you want to extend the warm-up or cardiovascular section.  However, the beginner and intermediate workouts can be used one right after the other if you fast forward through the intro.  I prefer Kick Butt Kombo, because you can just skip to each section you want to repeat to extend the cardio, warm-up or abs workouts.",1014940800,16,501,4.681818181818182
1330829,2,B00003ETMM,"The only good thing I can say about this video is that I got it on sale.  I consider myself to be on an intermediate/advanced work out level. This workout was just not enough, you warm up, do the cardio part of it (about ten minutes) and before you know it you're at the cool down portion. I read a few reviews about this DVD, and the one about the lump in his shorts is actually true... its so distracting, and the blond girl in the back doesn't have a clue what she's doing. The only person that seems motivated is Silk himself. I think i'll stick to my Tae Bo, even if its double the price.  After i'm done, i don't feel worked out at all, this is not a good buy if you're a good athlete, nor if you are a beginner. The moves that are put together are too confusing. ...",1012780800,71,773,4.012987012987013
1330830,5,B00003ETMM,I really enjoyed the workout. It is not too tough and gets your cardiovascular going. The bulge in Silk's shorts is great to look at. He is really well endowed and the shorts he wears is really tight which accentuates it.,986169600,11,221,4.414634146341464
1330832,5,B00003ETMM,I disagree that this workout is awful. Its a good step into kickboxing or any type of martial arts based workout. You can modify the movements for harder or less intense workout and its not boring or a bunch of double time this and jog that like some of the other dvds that make it as though you must kill yourself to exercise. If you do this in addition to a regular fitness routine to maybe use when you want to stay indoors on a rainy day or if you have just had a baby and need to be home and exercise it is a good addition to your home workouts. I use it about 5x/month when I cannot leave home for 1 reason or another. I use leg weights when I do the movements for more advanced technique or use my exercise step and do the movements on that. A good buy if you are mature enough to get over some of the visuals that other people mentioned.,1295568000,2,845,4.005917159763314
1330833,1,B00003ETMM,I was disappointed to watch this exercise DVD. The expectation was that the exercises were based upon kung fu and it was fairly retarded. I could find these exercises in the local gym just as well so I do not recommend this product to anyone expecting what is advertised.,1288656000,,271,4.551020408163265
1330834,1,B00003ETMM,"Just not impressed.  Bad camera angles, poor positioning of the background people and a terrible attempt at a bon bon joke...just not worth the money.  I like kickboxing, but would recommend trying one of the many other kickboxing dvd's out there as this is a waste.",1257292800,,266,4.760869565217392
1330835,5,B00003ETMM,"My friend gave me Khi Bae in a VHS tape about 7yrs ago.  At first I was not so sure.
I had made a bet with a friend to lose weight, so I got out all the different Videos I had.
After I got into a routine I loved Khi Bae.
Now 7yrs. later I have moved from my home on Oahu and live in the Bay Area.
It has taken me 3yrs to adjust.
I am now having to work on my health again and I remembered that I had lost 38 pounds the first time, so I decided to by Khi Bae on DVD.
For those people that like simple and repetitive moves this DVD offers it.
For me I enjoy his voice and the simple moves.
I like working on my stands and positions.  I also do Tai Chi and Akio.
If you like Aerobic style movements and are not interested in improving you martial art stands than it may not be for you.
For those people like me that need to take it slow again its a good starting place.
I believe that you must like the teacher to enjoy the workout.  So if you like his voice and his looks then it might be easier to stay with the program.",1251504000,,1019,3.730232558139535
1330836,4,B00003ETMM,"This is an extremely CORNY workout, but I like it. I find myself reaching for it when I want to do some cardio a lot more than my other DVDs. It's simple jabbing, punching and kicking. I agree with the other reviewer, the introduction that you can't skip past is nauseating, but just push play go get your water and come back. He's an interesting guy. Ladies, the shorts he wears will kepp you laughing/staring. That's got to be a sock in there.",1213574400,,445,4.373493975903615
1330837,5,B00003ETMM,"I find this workout to be a better kickboxing workout than tae bo. If you are just purely into aerobics, tae bo may be right for you. If you want to do actual kickboxing moves, khi bae is a better choice. I like how it actually puts emphasis on footwork and basic form. The warmup and cooldown are approprate for a cardio workout. Though the main workouts are short (you can replay them you know)for well conditioned people, the combos are progressed nicely instead of sporadically going from one thing to another like tae bo. I like how making windmill motions with you hands (as in tae bo) are replaced with uppercuts (that you actually use in kickboxing). I've been in martial arts for years and recommend this for anyone who wants to learn some basic kickboxing and get a cardio workout.",1212883200,,791,4.577464788732394
1330838,4,B00003ETMM,"This video is years old by now, so maybe there are better ones out there - or aerobics studios that offer cheap classes - but I rather liked the 20 minute version of Khi Bae that came with my 8 minute abs.

If there are beginners out there who are put off by all the snippy comments about this video, don't forget that these people all say that they are advanced. Therefore, what is ""too easy"" for them may very well be challenging and a great place for you to begin.

I would ordinarily be as annoyed as they about the blonde woman in the back (who is clearly no expert). It's not a good idea to teach bad form, after all. But in this video, the instructor is very clearly the one to watch for form, so that is not, I don't think, the issue.  What you so-called advanced exercisers may not have realized is that people who are not fit or particularly coordinated may actually see the blonde woman as inspirational - not someone to aspire TO, but rather, as someone who is willing to give it her best (ON CAMERA, no less), so they may feel just a little less self-conscious about getting up and trying it.

And finally - it says BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE on the box - what were all of you ""advanced"" exercisers doing with it to begin with?",1211414400,4,1235,4.28755364806867
1330839,5,B00003ETMM,"I know there are mixed reviews, but I really like this DVD. I've been teaching fitness classes for a long time and I got lots of great choreography to steal for my class. He builds the routines well, so it is easy for a beginner to understand the correct form. Plus - I like his music. I bought his other DVD as well. My BIG complaint is that the routines are MUCH too short. I do both of them in a row and then do something else afterwards. So it's a great cross training workout. I also like Kathy Smith's kickbox videos as the complexity of her routines are interesting, challenging and fun.",1194220800,,594,4.265486725663717
1330840,5,B00003ETMM,"To be honest I didn't even watch the beginner part of the DVD but went directly to the intermediate portion, I'm in fairly good shape and even being a short workout time-wise if you really do the leg and upper body work this is a really intense workout (granted if you do it with the same intensity the people in the background are doing you might as well not bother). Silk is a very commanding presence in this video and to reiterate the comments of a couple of other reviewers he is VERY conspicuous in those shorts, actually I think it makes it more interesting if you don't get hypnotized to the point of not concentrating on the workout, of course when he does some of the roundhouse and side kicks its all but impossible not to catch your breath as it looks like a softball is stuffed in there somewhere...even with my more prurient observations aside a great video and a nice change of personality from some of the more ""plastic"" exercise video gurus.",1173225600,,958,4.48
1330841,5,B00003ETMM,"I have the Tae Bo videos and although Khi Bae is a bit cheesy, I find it to be fun and actually look forward to the workouts. This is a great DVD for beginners because it's not as difficult and fast

as Tae Bo and you still work up a pretty good sweat. The intros are

annoying if you're in a hurry but they aren't a big deal for me. The only negative is that Silk Manning never made any new Khi Bae workouts for when you advance past these two.",1156291200,,445,3.879120879120879
1330842,5,B00003ETMM,I love the workout.  I find it to be about 30 minutes a good workout when time is limited.  I found the moves easy to follow but really worked up a sweat.  I don't like the layout of the dvd.  There is no way to skip the intro of Silk doing a little kung foo show except fast forward.,1140652800,4,284,3.76271186440678
1330843,4,B00003ETMM,"Fun, a great challenging workout that's empowering.  The basic workout is ok, but the intermediate is greaaaat.  I'm a middle-aged woman and can keep up with this terrific workout.  Try it!",1126569600,,189,5.032258064516129
1330844,4,B00003ETMM,"This is a great dvd for beginners. Silk takes the time to explain the moves and keeps you motivated. If you're deciding between this and Tae Bo and you are a beginner, get this one first.

There are only 2 minor complaints.

1. The introduction you have to sit through of Silk Manning showing off his kickboxing moves is a bit corny. He's a model so I guess he couldn't help the urge to grab the spotlight for a minute.

2. Once you start getting comfortable with the intermediate level you begin to wish it was longer. Again, if you're a beginner the length of the workout is perfect, but once you move into intermediate you want more. Thats when I'd recommend you move to Tae Bo.",1103932800,10,681,4.346456692913386
1330845,5,B00003ETMM,"I tried various workouts at home and did not stick with any of them. Khi Bae workout is very good, if you are busy to do anything else. It is easy to follow. I did not like Tae-Bo workout, it is too fast and requires too much time to learn all the moves, where Khi Bae is much easier to follow",1095206400,7,293,3.819672131147541
1330846,2,B00003ETMM,"Just by his name, Silk Manning, you can tell how cheesy the workout is. The music is so annoying and he is even more so. With a background in kickboxing, I found his movements incorrect and his instructions lacking. I can see how a newcomer could hurt themselves because he does not instruct properly how to follow through with the movements. It DOES get your heart rate up and you will sweat. However, it won't be the workout that you are dying to do.",1092614400,15,452,4.392857142857143
1330847,4,B00003ETMM,I like the instructor. He keeps you coming back for more. Would have gotten 5 stars if not for the dvd structure that prevents you from going straight to the workout part instead of having to fast forward every time. Maybe i'll reburn it with chaps. :),1077235200,3,252,4.382978723404255
1330848,4,B00003ETMM,This was a much more enjoyable workout for me than Billy Blanks. The moves felt more realistic and Silk Manning was not out to work people to death. This does not include any ab work (just so you know).,1069372800,3,202,4.205128205128205
1330849,3,B00003ETMM,"Anyone who is interested in purchasing this DVD, I have to tell you, don't. (Not because it's a bad workout, it's a fantastic workout. It got my heart pumping and I felt completely energized when I finished.)The intermediate workout on this DVD is a bonus workout on the DVD ""8 minute arms and abs"". This is also a excellent workout, plus on the ""8 min.."" DVD you don't have to put up the Silk's endless posing in the intro.",1069200000,6,424,4.379746835443038
1330850,5,B00003ETMM,Craig was not kidding when he wrote his review below.  Silk is gorgeous. His bulge is awesome. Huge one. Great view to watch him bouncing all around in them tight white shorts.  Even if you do not want to do the workout. Just buy it for the bulge watching.,1056844800,3,256,4.204081632653061
7918867,5,B00003ETMM,Love this workout!!!,1411257600,,20,6.0
7918868,5,B00003ETMM,"I can actually do the moves, and it really gets my heart pounding! I had soooooo much fun the first time I used it that I did a video blog about it on a Sparkpeople! I never thought I could enjoy kickboxing. I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried something new.",1400371200,,274,4.0
7918869,4,B00003ETMM,I've been using this video off and on for 10 years and I love it . Manny is great ! The people he used suck and don't know how to do the workout .. But overall I'm a fan,1396742400,,169,3.358974358974359
7918870,4,B00003ETMM,"I like this workout!  It is fun and entertaining.  Silk gives very clear instruction and is easy to follow.  I would suggest this DVD for sure.  The only complaint is the 90 second intro to each workout,  Seems kinda ""show-off-ish"".",1388620800,,232,4.7
7918871,4,B00003ETMM,I had this workout when it first came out on VHS! I loved it because it was easy to follow and yet it made you work up a sweat.  Sure the video was short but it was perfect for beginner like me.  Just one thing I did not like: the music was so corny!!,1367193600,,251,3.6296296296296298
7918872,3,B00003ETMM,I thought the product would have been better. Silk is to busy trying to be sexy instead of working people to the point of sweating.,1364083200,,131,4.28

7918875,2,B00003ETMM,Didn't really care for this DVD. My husband and I did it a few times and if you're not careful you could hurt yourself.  We are seasoned walkers and had never tried kick-boxing. We will stick to walking!!!Try some of Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's if you want a good workout without getting hurt!,1327276800,2,296,4.584905660377358
7918876,4,B00003ETMM,"I have always liked Khi Bae.  I bought the VHS about ten years ago at Target.  My tapes got ruined so luckily the dvd was available.  I read some comments saying you can't fast forward, but that's not true.  You are able to fast fwd, rewind, and pause.  It's quick and fast.  Yes the ppl in the background are kind of off with the routine ... but who cares!  I'm watching the instructor.  Do you watch others for guidance in an actual class?  No...you watch the instructor.  It's fun, and fast.  It's a good vid for beginners. I choose this over Tae Bo.",1309737600,,553,4.271844660194175
