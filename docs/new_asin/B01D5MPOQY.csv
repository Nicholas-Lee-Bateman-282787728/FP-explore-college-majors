7697794,5,B01D5MPOQY,"The movie was very suspenseful and touched on alot of feelings viewers could identify with and stay held throughout the film, and Nikki,  that chicka was crayyyyzeeeeeee!!!...",1468800000,,175,5.481481481481482
7697795,2,B01D5MPOQY,"Brave Cornelius Williams (Alexander C. Mulzac) is an upstanding person. He is a successful real estate person who gives back to his community, is good looking, and loves his mamma. We meet Nikki (Erin Sanderson) as a lying determined woman who wants to get her hooks into Brave. There is an instant dislike for a woman known to her co-workers as ""Sister Strange."" Soon they are married and we find out how strange she is, but no background on her life until the end.

The film intends to show us the value and impact of good parenting, and in doing so, makes the characters overly good and bad, i.e. unrealistic. I was bored for much of the film.

7697799,5,B01D5MPOQY,"Where Hearts Lie, is unparalleled to anything I've seen in a long time. Clifton Powell gave a riveting performance of what it's like to live with Alzheimer's, his performance alone deserves an award. Alexander Mulzac portrayed a positive role model as a loving son and caring father; one that's isn't depicted enough. He's surely to become a household name, the cast and crew were exciting to watch. Kudos to Malik Yoba and Taral Hicks for blessing us with their presence. Mr. Tony Lindsay is a visionary to say the least, his directing is unmatched by far. I look forward to seeing more of his work. This movie will make you smile,cry and feel good all at the same time. Tanya Thompson and Tony Lindsay: Bravo!",1467331200,3,711,4.696
7697800,1,B01D5MPOQY,"The movie didn't give time for the craziness to creep in on us. The character was shown immediately to be crazy. When she came to visit the parents it would have been better to have made her someone lovable especially to the mother. That would have been more powerful because mothers intuition would sense something wrong but in this case the mother was a clueless woman. There was no suspense, a very predictable movie.",1466899200,,420,4.6891891891891895

8755040,1,B01D5MPOQY,I am surprised by the good rating this film received. This movie is horrible; subjects are introduced and not followed up on. It is poorly written and filmed and at times does not connect. Waste of my time...so bad couldn't stop watching it to see if it could possibly get worse!!!

In some ways a little scary as a single black man navigating the dating scene.",1493251200,,246,4.25531914893617
