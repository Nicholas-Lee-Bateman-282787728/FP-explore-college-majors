8100938,3,B000CR7R66,"Y'all remember Rahsan-Rahsan from Brown?  He's in this film.  If you want to support alums trying to make it in film, then peep this.  On campus, Rahsan was high-achieving (sp?), well-respected, nice, and an alpha male.  It's a bit hard to suspend one's disbelief and see him playing a brotha who might as well chant, ""Everyday I'm hustling!  Everyday I'm hustling!""  To be honest, you will never say this film in the same breath as ""The Color Purple.""  Still, see it to see ol' Rahsan-Rahsan on the screen!",1304985600,,507,4.693181818181818
