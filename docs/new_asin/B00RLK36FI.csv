6931905,3,B00RLK36FI,"Following the death of mom, Rose (Miranda Cosgrove) and her father (Donal Logue) move from sunny California to snowy Chicago. Dad is married to his work. Rose takes psychotic meds and has trouble with the house with a history. She has dreams, hears noises, sees stuff move, has issue with the neighbors, stuck doors, and a doll's head that likes the view in different rooms of the house.

The film builds slow, in fact a bit too slow as I grew bored over stuff moving. When we figure out the mystery, which wasn't too hard to do, we realize the film is one of an overcrowded genre which gave us better productions. This was done perhaps for the kids who grew up with Miranda and never saw those other films. Not a bad film, but that will bring deja vu to seasoned viewers.

6931907,2,B00RLK36FI,"I cannot recommend this movie.  I didn't like the opening murder scene.  If there had been a trailer I probably would have passed on this movie.  I started watching for errors at one point.  The lead girl goes to sleep in a normal black tank and wakes up in a gray string tank top.  That made me laugh. The old potato she found in a dresser looked too well preserved and if it was rotting it would have stunk.  I thought her acting was bad/ wooden and hard to watch.  There was no chemistry between any of the characters.  If a character was going to try to open a stuck drawer, the first attempt look phoney.  The neighbor girl thought the house was so creepy that she couldn't understand how anyone could live there, and yet she let herself in without knocking and started roaming about.  The stand out was the blond young man.  I don't know if he can act, but he was fun to look at.  I would like to see him again.  Over all this was just a boring not very well done, even annoying movie.  The writing/directing and staging did not do the movie any favors either.",1425081600,,1066,4.2388059701492535

6931910,2,B00RLK36FI,"Like everyone else I'm sure, I was brought here due to the presence of Miranda Cosgrove. I heard this was her first live action appearance in a role since iCarly ended back in 2012. This is also her first ""mature"" role since getting out of Nickelodeon. However, I do think this role is just simply way too odd for Miranda and her acting in the film shows that. Now, I do not in any sense think that Miranda HAS to be in a kid-friendly role with everything she does. No, since she is 21 now it makes since she would want to go out and do something that people her age would respect her in. However, the horror genre????? A movie that doesn't even get released to theaters??????? Come on, i think most fans of Miranda can agree that she deserves way better and should be in something that can show off her true acting abilities. Aside from Miranda, the films plot comes off so cliche and something we have all seen before in every other horror movie ever made. The story isn't anything to really get invested in, the most enjoyable part of the film was just simply seeing Miranda on screen. For all we could know Miranda just did the role for the money since she has fallen kind of out of the spotlight quite a bit. Hopefully, she doesn't completely fall out because I think there is more she can do.",1424822400,,1298,4.323770491803279
6931911,3,B00RLK36FI,"Miranda Cosgrove makes a respectable transition from her zany television program iCarly to serious horror with this uninspired but watchable horror flick about a troubled young woman named Rose who starts seeing and hearing strange things as soon as she moves into a new house with her dad.  The problem for Rose is that she was forced to take a leave from Stanford and also flushed the pills her psychiatrist prescribed for her down the toilet, so she doesn't make for the most credible witness when weird things happen.

Rose eventually finds out that a previous girl about her age who lived in the house was thought to have disappeared, although an e-mail somehow managed to eventually convince the police that she was actually alive and well and had left on her own.  Nobody quite seems to know what happened to the old church-going woman who previously owned the house either.  She was supposedly a pillar of the community but Rose eventually finds a journal written by the missing girl which suggests that the supposedly devout and sweet old lady was actually an abusive monster.

The official story is that the old lady's son and the homeless girl they had taken in ran away together (although the only evidence of this anyone ever refers to is an e-mail) and that the old woman subsequently disappeared herself.  Since she was a volunteer at both charities and her church you would think that if she suddenly was no longer around some people might actually be concerned--but that's just one of the problems with the script which really doesn't seem to be all that well thought out.

It doesn't make much sense that Rose never tries to track down the previous owner of the house, especially since she knows which church the old woman was a member of and volunteer at, meaning it would have taken virtually no effort and might have yielded some answers concerning what actually happened in the house before Rose and her dad moved in.  It also makes no sense that the police would close a missing persons investigation based on an e-mail that was supposedly sent by the missing teen, or that nobody would wonder what happened to the previous owner of the house when she was so well known in the community that a front page newspaper story was written about her charitable act of taking in the runaway teen.  It's also hard to understand how Rose's father came to purchase the house in the first place considering the fact that nobody actually knows where the previous owner is.

The Intruders never rises above the level of being watchable.  The movie looks suitably ominous, the acting is fine, things move along just quickly enough that the film never actually becomes boring, but the script does very little with its premise, has too many elements that don't make sense if you stop to think about them and ultimately telegraphs its big twist so that the audience will very likely figure out what's going way before Miranda Cosgrove's Rose does.  The Intruders should have done a lot more with its supernatural elements and also with the idea that Rose may not be able to trust what she sees and hears since she might be mentally ill.  The movie also could have used another twist besides the obvious one that many viewers will see coming.

The Intruders isn't ultimately very suspenseful or interesting but it is easy to sit through and qualifies as a decent time waster if nothing more--it's made with a lot of polish but unfortunately has a script that could have been greatly improved by a rewrite.  If you choose to watch this one make sure to keep your expectations low.",1424736000,12,3583,4.719551282051282

6931919,4,B00RLK36FI,"This wasn't that bad a movie, it's light on scares, violence, gore for a creepy thriller genre movie. You could even I guess call this a kids target market aimed family movie thriller.  It obviously doesn't have a big budget and like most made for TV or straight to DVD budget movies, it uses a big name from a once highly popular TV show (in this case iCarly's Miranda Cosgrove) as a draw card to get viewers.  Fans of Sons of Anarchy and other TV shows will also recognise the actor playing her father Donal Logue, albeit he doesn't have a great amount of screen time.  But compared to other budget thrillers, it isn't actually that bad.

Basically a twenty year old hasn't coped with the suicide of her mother who she had been the primary carer for while her father coped with her illness by spending his time at work.  He has moved them to a new town into huge house that is badly in need of repair.  He has some big plans to renovate the place but copes with dealing with his daughter' issues the same old way by leaving her alone in the house and going away to work.  The movie starts off as sort of a low budget version of the Conjuring, with a bit of Rear Window thrown in.  Miranda's character is being frightened by weird stuff happening in the house, she's asked by the neighbour how she could live there after what happened, she does some online investigating and finds out something disturbing about the house's prior occupants.  Being that she has stopped taking her meds though, is it all in her head?

The only real thing that I kept thinking of was, if the past owners just left and there was only an e-mail explaining that they are okay, who did the father buy the house from?",1476230400,,1694,4.36624203821656

I enjoyed how they portrayed her slowly going crazy. But is she really, or is there something else going on.

A big trail of crumbs were left so it wasn't a surprise when you find out what exactly is going on. There was a red herring thrown in, but it was so obvious, that unless youve never watched a horror movie in your life, you know its nothing/nobody to worry about.

The ending was very rushed though. It was just, BAM! I would have liked to have had more story as to why they turned out that way.

The one thing that annoyed me, just because nothing ever came of it, was the emphasis they put on their furniture having not arrived yet. And then at the end, once again on the furniture But there was no need for it. Its not like someone got ran over by the moving van.",1452816000,,860,4.076923076923077

She was all right (not great) in this film that asked little from her as an actress. In fact, the entire cast was just okay. A couple were less than okay, but I put that on the script. The dad and the neighbor dad had nothing to work with. What lines they had were stupid and their reactions to certain situations were ludicrous. What man would just stand there quietly while the obnoxious new neighbor accuses him of being a serial killer? As we watched, we came up with a number of great ideas as to what was going on, all of them better than what turned out to be. After the movie we discussed numerous plot holes and the number of missed opportunities to develop something. Ultimately, as others have written, this is a watchable movie and fairly enjoyable, but without much effort, it could have been much better. Miranda really was given nothing to work with to demonstrate her worth as a dramatic actress. Sigh. Probably better as a rental because it is doubtful we will watch it a second time.",1430524800,3,1098,4.413793103448276

6931982,3,B00RLK36FI,"So I rented this movie for 24 hours because I knew it wasn't going to be good enough to purchase.  That being said, it wasn't horrible.  I wanted to see what Miranda Cosgrove could do in a different setting than the unchallenging ICarly character she's been doing for years.  To be honest, I thought she did a decent job in the second half of the movie.  The first half was a bit slow, and didn't really give her much to work with as far as dialogue.  Honestly though, the character of the father was probably the worst actor.  His scenes weren't even believeable, and when placed next to him, Ms. Cosgrove's acting was actually fairly good.  Austin Butler was just alright.  The girl that lived across the street didn't say much in the movie, and didn't seem like an actual part of the story.  The bad thing about this movie for me was the quick and abrupt ending.  I saw the time stamp, and at 1:24:00 of a 1:32:00 length movie, you still haven't been introduced to the antagonist yet. (except for a newspaper clipping shot which was fairly quick)  Also, was it necessary for this director to have the T & A shots of Miranda?  It had nothing to do with the movie, and although she obviously agreed to it, there was no point to it.  She changes into a shirt and shows her bra, then gets up and walks away in underwear.  Hopefully, this isn't the end of her career, because I just think the movie was flawed, not her acting.  If she had been given a romantic comedy or action movie first, that may have been better than your standard horror flick.  That being said, this still wasn't too bad, but I would only get it through rental, and not expect a whole lot.  The movie = 4/10, Miranda Cosgrove's acting = 6/10",1426636800,3,1712,4.367088607594937
6931983,3,B00RLK36FI,"RENT DON""T BUY i watched the trailer for this movie and i thought this was going to be a realy scary movie but no only one part made me jump i mean the story and the script was so good but the way they left out the terror made me wana scream and i rarely even say these things about movies and also it is moving realy fast and in the end your heart will be beating with pain wondering what""s gona happen next",1426550400,,408,3.869047619047619
6931984,4,B00RLK36FI,"I was in the mood for something creepy, that wasn't a blood fest and this fit the bill.  There is nothing new, no surprises, and the last scene was an unnecessary cliche but Miranda Cosgrove carried the movie and made it watchable. It was refreshing to see a female character fight back.  If you are looking for something original, I would pass, but if you are a fan of this genre with low expectations, you will enjoy it.",1426377600,,422,4.397435897435898
6931985,2,B00RLK36FI,"Fairly hum-drum thriller/horror with some new Tv faces, Miranda Cosgrove, Donal Logue (SAR, Vikings, Law & Order SVU & Gotham) some guy from the Carrie Diaries, and a few fine actors like Michael Luckett and Tom Sizemore sprinkled around. I would have liked it better if the doll head had done just ONE supernatural thing but it never did. You know, an eye swivel, an evil laugh...

Miranda did ok but I read she's going back to TV. She's very obnoxious in this. it's hard to have any sympathy for her character when she's just shouting at everyone. Jenessa Grant is like a baby Anna Kendrick.

All the snow made  the house look cold and the clothing ridiculous. There was no hint of a central heating system, heavy curtains, double glazed windows, a fire, ugly sweaters, thermal underwear,  in short whatever you would need not to become a Popsicle.  These people were from California, please. They'd be feeling it.

SPOILERS**************

What the film reminded me of most was those real life news stories of people hiding in the walls. Those never end well.",1426291200,7,1061,4.7650273224043715
6931986,3,B00RLK36FI,"While the acting was okay, the main problem was how slowly it took for the story to build up. Half way through you wonder if the film is going any where. Austin butler's acting was wonderful, but his character's role was basically purposeless. The ending ten minutes we finally get some action. At least it ended on a good note. If you are searching for a good scary movie search else where.",1426204800,,391,4.444444444444445
