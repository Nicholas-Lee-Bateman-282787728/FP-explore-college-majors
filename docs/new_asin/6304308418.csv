Treat yourself to classy entertainment with ""Separate Tables"".",1030233600,2,249,5.25
843157,5,6304308418,"Mr. Niven, quite simply, walks away with this film! Billed third, after Kerr and Hayworth and with less screen time than Lancaster he steals the film! Honestly folks, I've tried several times to review this film but I can't get past Niven's sublime, beautifully understated performance! For once the Academy got it right and gave him the Oscar!",1012953600,3,344,4.948275862068965
843158,2,6304308418,"I love this wonderful movie. ""Separate Tables"" is a very, very good movie, the acting in it is superb. But I am very displeased with the sound. On my DVD the sound is awful.

843159,5,6304308418,"When Separate Tables was released, the agents of Deborah Kerr and Rita Hayworth fought for top billing in the opening credits.  It's easy to understand after viewing this powerful film.  Separate Tables is a great study in human nature and relationships among people who are far from faultless.
Burt Lancaster displays both intense anger and hopeless longing as his former wife Rita Hayworth comes back into his life.  David Niven (who won an Oscar for this role) is superb as the military man with a past.  Watch Niven as he is confronted with the truth about himself and how he interacts with his friends and those who once were his friends.  The strength of the film is in its casting.  In the hands of lesser actors, the film would turn into a very sappy melodrama.  I am anxious to view the film again just to catch all the subtle facial expressions that these wonderful actors use to make their characters even more believable.  A great ensemble, a great film.",972345600,114,966,4.674556213017752

843309,5,6304308418,"A hit on the stage; I think the film even better. An all-star cast with Deborah Kerr triumphant, extraordinarily sympathetic (in the original sense), and David Niven, equally so. Set in an English seaside town with longer term stays for its guests. Delbert Mann was an outstanding director and he brought the most out of an ensemble that includes Burt Lancaster. I admire this little film and if you're receptive to a theme that was daring in its time, watch two really fine actors transform from meek and anxious to small lives that seem heroic. Lawrence Harvey and Margaret Leighton played the roles on stage. Gone too soon, each in their own way, very very good. Kerr's character was required to play against her beauty. Niven, in real life, was the wit of Hollywood insiders. He wrote two books incidentally - not ghost written, I highly recommend. Few great raconteurs with self-deprecating wit in Hollywood - Niven was one. A jocular man, see him in this and think about the art of acting.",1478822400,3,995,4.757225433526012

It was as if she really became the person she portrayed, not only by the way she spoke but also by her body language.  I enjoy a good drama as long as it doesn't pull too hard at my heartstrings.  So this DVD is a welcome addition to my collection.  I'm glad that it has subtitles.  Otherwise, I would not have bought it.",1472601600,,452,4.439024390243903
843313,5,6304308418,"Love this fantastic classic story. Stars Burt Lancaster and Rita Hayworth as ex-spouses who end up in the same British seaside hotel where he has been living, and is engaged to the lady who manages the hotel. She arrives seemingly by happenstance, but not the case, she definitely has an agenda that clearly involves getting him back!!!!  Other hotel characters (including Rod Taylor, David Niven and others) provide interesting back stories that unfold over the course of a few days. Fantastic black and white movie from a time when movies really did tell a story worth watching.  Excellent movie for anyone who truly loves the old classics!!!",1470873600,2,644,5.009345794392523

843431,4,6304308418,"If Lancaster had allowed Mann's work to stand untampered with (listen to Man's commentary on the DVD), AND had been less heavy-handed in his acting, especially in his scenes with the wonderful Hiller (although I recognize that the character he was playing was heavy-handed), I would have given 5 stars.  The Niven-Kerr-Hiller portion would rate 5-plus. Sad that in the conflation of the two original plays, the Second Team was written as Americans (Gee, I wonder why); I never saw the original performance of the plays -- I'm old, but not that old -- but as I read ""Table Seven"" I can only picture a more subtle narrative than what resulted in the film; and when I hear that co-producer Lancaster cut fine introductory scenes by Kerr, no doubt to put more focus on himself later in the picture, I could cry -- I admire Susan Hayward and her Oscar-wnning work in ""I want to Live"", but can't help but think that her role there was an easier one to pull off than Kerr's very difficult, brilliant and effective work, accomplished in great part by the subtlest, most nuanced of changes in expression and even posture, I have to feel that the wrong actress won that Oscar. And lastly, like Mann, my reaction was somewhere between anger and nausea at the banal song that Lancaster stuck on the beginning of the film, over the credits -- I guess he had thought that a silly song and Frankie Laine was a great start to ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" a year earlier -- that made me cringe, too. but at least it wasn't marring a very fine, complex drama for grown-ups. Still, I forgive Lancaster a lot for his  under-recognised, superb work in ""Atlantic City"" -- a shame that other considerations sent the best actor Oscar elsewhere that year.",1454544000,2,1729,4.6103896103896105
843432,4,6304308418,"Like ""Sunset Boulevard"" a real film noir movie. Like anything I write on these pages I won't write the story line only to say to get that you have to watch the ""play"". If you do you are seeing a cast of actors whose abilities cannot be assembled or equaled in today's world. Pretty strong statement but I believe it to be true. The setting is strange to us now in the States but continues in the rest of the world. A retirement hotel where guests come and stay for long periods of time even terminal periods. Meals are served and you eat at Separate Tables. You are, yet not, family. There is humor; there is romance; there is cruelty; there is superb acting. please watch it.",1454284800,,676,4.330708661417323

Niven unwavering in his portrayal. Worth it to see all these wonderful actors playing against type with such fluid technique. Working off of each other and supporting each other. We have to keep recommending these real works of art for generations to come. I hope they never die out as there will never be Actors and or stories like this again.

Stellar performances by Burt Lancaster, Rita Hayworth, Deborah Kerr, David Niven, Wendy Hiller, Gladys Cooper, Rod Taylor, Audrey Dalton, Cathleen Nesbitt, Felix Aylmer and May Hallatt, brilliantly directed by Delbert Mann (based on the fabulous story by Terence Rattigan). Set in the quaint 'Beauregard Hotel' in Brighton, England, this 1958 televisual feast of a film offers (and indeed engages the viewer in) a truly masterful philosophical treatise on the often overlapping and conflicting dynamics of intrigue, love, attraction, resentment, shattered confidence, betrayal, control, emotional exploitation and manipulation, misrepresentation, shameless opportunism, altruism, innocence, forgiveness, self-discovery, self-assertion, etc, all tempered with just the right doses of subtle and sophisticated humour and cynicism, laced with considerable wisdom (by one or two of the characters). Apart from the fact that you will greatly enjoy this film, it will awaken certain emotions within you (perhaps even relating them to some of your own vaguely or not-so-vaguely similar experiences, trials and tribulations). It will also leave you with two or three timeless lessons in life (... for life)! I cannot think of many films that achieved so much on such a low budget or even great budget. This film can be enjoyed alone or with others, but demands the absence of distractions. It requires focus and 'decorum' during the viewing process, for it is a dignified film that commands as much respect as it does admiration.

844064,5,6304308418,"I loved this film, even whilst cursing the actions of some of the characters in it.  So many stubborn and obstinate personalities, with self-defeating self-will rather than common sense taking charge.

But isn't that the human condition ?

The subtle tension was sustained throughout the film, with a perfect lead up to a classic underplayed dramatic very British ending.

But what next ?  The film leaves this question in the air.  Will the friendship of Sybil (Kerr), and the acceptance by the others (except Mrs Maud Railton-Bell) of the Major (Niven) help the Major to overcome his problem ?

This is a dilemma as old as humankind, and still unsolved today.

So, in my opinion, this film is as relevant today as it ever was, with the question still up in the air.  If we were in that dining room that morning, what would our attitude be ?",1417824000,,842,4.635135135135135
844065,5,6304308418,"I love older black and white movies...especially this one. My dvd arrived quick and in perfect condition. Its really amazing that David Niven won the best lead actor Oscar for this when he appears in only 16 minutes of a 100 minute film...whats with that? Its clearly an ensemble acting film and his role is supporting. Oh well, my favorite is the great Gladys Cooper playing an obnoxious snob perfectly!",1417305600,,404,4.785714285714286
844066,5,6304308418,"I only recently discovered this very interesting and suprisingly dramatic film - and I liked it a lot! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in England, in a little hotel, lives a group of mostly unrelated, very different people who actually could fit quite nicely in an Agatha Christie book...))) The main characters are:

- a retired, middle aged, flamboyant British officer whom everybody calls just Major. He is played by David Niven, who very deservedly got an Oscar for this role.

- John Malcolm (Burt Lancaster), a heavy drinking American with a past...

- Lady Matheson (Cathleen Nesbitt), an absolutely charming, gentle, dove-hearted old widow

- Miss Meacham, a very energetic and strong opinioned woman, about whom we know little - this is a secondary character but she totally steals every scene she appears in. Incredibly she is played by veteran actress May Hallatt, who was 86 at the time - but you would never believe that!

- Mr Fowler (Felix Aylmer), a retired teacher, a rather likeable albeit weak willed man

- Mrs Maud Railton-Bell (Gladys Cooper), whom I can only describe as The Wicked Witch of West Hampshire...))) She is a very, very distinguished old lady - and we want to kick her in the butt 30 seconds after her first appearance...

- last, but definitely not least, is Sibyl Railton-Bell, a vulnerable, suffering, shy, mousy, prematurely aged spinster, daughter of the Wicked Witch of West Hampshire; she is played by Deborah Kerr, who gives here an AMAZING performance. When you see Sibyl, you simply cannot imagine that this is the same woman, who also played barely a couple of years earlier smoking hot women in ""From here to eternity"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""King Solomon's mines"" or ""King and I"". The fact that Deborah Kerr never got a real Oscar, just a honorary one in 1994, is one of great injustices in history of world cinema...

The woman who owns and manages the hotel, Pat Cooper (Wendy Hiller), also plays an important role in the story - Wendy Hiller actually also got an Oscar for her role (Best Supporting Actress). A little bit after the beginning a new guest checks in - Ann Shankland (Rita Hyaworth) a rich and famous American woman.

What follows is a study of relations between those people, especially after some disturbing information becomes known about one of them - I will not say anything more about the story, you really deserve to discover it by yourself.

The film is carried by excellent dialogs and the great talent of all actors, with David Niven and Deborah Kerr giving the best performances. Although there is no violence or death, the film is surprisingly dramatic. In fact, even if only words and an occasional newspaper are used, many scenes are actually battles - with the words ""Good morning"" being the supreme weapon, which carries the day...

I liked this film A LOT and I will definitely keep my DVd for another viewing in the future. A most excellent thing! ENJOY!",1416528000,2,2965,4.81496062992126

Who could have guessed how painfully relevant this obscure old B&W film would be in the brave new age of facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.?  My guess is, Kerr, Hayworth and Lancaster were cast to bring in the fans, and their performances are solid in a 1958 style, but Niven gets uncomfortably close to our own reluctant half-truths and self-deceptions.

Like Olive Films , KINO has begun releasing classic films on BR.  The first one I received was ""The Scalphunters"" and it was like Olive films... over priced, not a great print, without any restoration or even moderate cleanup.  Separate Tables, an award winning film from Burt Lancaster's own production company is a different story however, perhaps it is that black and white film is more stable than color, but the transfer on this BR is sharp , contrasty, with brilliant mid tones... in a word fantastic!  Unlike the other film this does feature a commentary and trailer so .... bonus features are a plus.

Burt is big, ungainly in a sweet english country hotel that he nearly does not fit it physically. Hayworth is less than good as her acting seemed out in left field at times. There were however some great scenes with Kerr and Hayworth that were memorable.

844498,5,6304308418,"Burt Lancaster's legacy as an unforgettable actor from the 1940s to 1990s is an inextricable part of popular culture. But his legacy as a pioneer producer is less well known. The high artistry of one modest film ""Separate Tables"" (1958) produced by the great actor and star, firmly puts Lancaster in the group of the greatest actor-producers in Hollywood History. He and his close friend Kirk Douglas led the way for other great leading actors to complement their successful acting careers with a turn to producing inspired independent films that changed Hollywood forever.

The cinematic genius  of Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, and Clint Eastwood in 1960s and 70s, as actors and producers, was influenced by the career moves of independent producers like Lancaster and Douglas in the 1950s. Marlon Brando's short but brilliant foray into production, with his formation of Pennebaker Productions, and the making of perhaps the greatest western made in America in the 1960s, ""One Eyed Jacks"", while a class of its own, owes much of its sensibility of dissent to a breed of movies from the 1950s, like ""Separate Tables"", that dared to be different, when it was terribly hard to do so.

Where did Lancaster get the insight to produce those stunning gems in the 1950s? He had an eye for getting underrated actors and directors together. Ernest Borgnine and Tony Curtis got to do original and deeply moving work in ""Marty"" (1955) and ""Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957) thanks to the genius of the directors of these classics: Delbert Mann and Alexander Mackendrick.  Lancaster was also behind bringing Audrey Hepburn from her customary urbane and sophisticated roles to her first role in a western: the original ""Unforgiven""(1960), another underrated western. But in my book, ""Separate Tables"" (1958),  which he produced with his collaborator Ben Hecht, is his best film. This intense film brought together David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Rita Hayworth, Wendy Hiller and Delbert Mann together in one movie, and the result is unforgettable. Has David Niven, Rita Hayworth, or Deborah Kerr been any better? And Lancaster himself in a stunning turn on screen as a lost soul in love with the Rita Hayworth and Wendy Miller characters in the film easily holds up to the intensity of his best roles.

The movie is a masterpiece and a showcase for the acting range of these major stars. David Niven and Deborah Kerr are in roles that are atypical for them: neurotic, pathetic, marginalized, characters deeply afraid of life.  Lancaster is good as ever but his real accomplishment is putting this project together to get these inspired performances from key actors. Dame Wendy Hiller's intense but quiet performance as the inn keeper, Deborah Kerr's performance as a neurotic girl in love with Niven's portrayal of the tragicomic ""Major"" are invaluable moments in cinema, and invites repeated viewings.

Wendy Hiller (as Pat Cooper) and Burt Lancaster (as John Malcom) are two solitaries, one the owner of a quaint inn separate from the world, the other a drifter struggling with his demons. He is a long-term resident in the inn. The desperate purity of both these characters bring them together. But there are bumps along the road as we witness Lancaster spiraling out of control with his drunkenness. Unexpected guests change the course of Pat Cooper's relationship with John Malcolm as Delbert Mann stages a haunting return of star Rita Hayworth in the role of a faded beauty, Ann Shankland, John Malcom's ex-partner. Her faded beauty is not without the allure that drew Malcolm to her. She enters his life and she proves irresistible once again. This time Malcom sees in Ann something deeper. Her fabulous beauty is no longer skin deep; he is drawn to her differently. The scenes that show the pull between Malcolm and Ann, with Pat on the periphery, create tortuous moments of divided loyalties in Malcolm. Pat's resolve, and Ann's helplessness, create confusion and remorse in Malcolm. The rousing drama created here is a testament to Mr. Mann's brilliance as a director. The contrasts and similarities between doomed and blessed couples is agonizing to watch. But when Dame Wendy Hiller as Pat Cooper intervenes with the quiet moral loftiness she customarily brings to screen, we see the moral depth of this extraordinary film come alive.

Rita Hayworth's screen presence is something to behold. Even if she is portraying the role of a faded and tragic beauty her magnetism has hardly diminished. Lancaster and Hayworth have a resonant chemistry. Hiller, too, as Pat, never disappoints; she has a way about her, graceful, always in control, despite being hopelessly in love. Her sort of loneliness appears self-sufficient compared to Ann; indeed the theme of loneliness takes several guises from Niven's Major Pollock character, which is as compelling as Hiller's to Kerr's Sibyl. Niven's departure from the roles he is known to play, is courageous. The elegance and polish of his screen presence takes a back seat to this inspired portrayal of a lost, pathetic, but ultimately tragic soul. He is part Inspector Clousseau, and part Prince Myshkin, a curious saint condemned to buffoonery. He is a bumbling character who desperately wants to be seen as a man of the world even if he is condemned to his idiosyncracies, fears, and his utter cluelessness to that world. He is scared of the world as much as the neurotic girl Sibyl who is attracted to him. Kerr too has ventured far from her ""comfort"" zone as an actor in her role as a helpless, and utterly nervous girl, completely in love with Major Pollock.

I have seen this film many times and every time I see the scenes between Hayworth and Lancaster, Kerr and Niven, I am convinced of the film's unique place in film history. This little gem transcends melodrama. This is one of those  forgotten classics from the 1950s that I cannot recommend highly enough. Movies like this tend to go ""off the radar"" and remain tragically unwatched.  If you are in the mood for a Hollywood classic see this 1958 version of ""Separate Tables"". It will be a rewarding and nostalgic look at the heights that cinema had attained in the 1950s, when great ""maverick"" filmmakers and stars brought their sensibilities to bear to a wave of independently produced films. Forgotten classics like ""Separate Tables"" uniquely bear the stamp of the old Hollywood classics while also being infused by a bold artistic spirit that would decisively change Hollywood forever with the influence they had on the creation of a new breed of movies in the 1960s and 70s.",1359158400,5,6601,5.001821493624773

I knew that this was an adaptation of a play (by Terence Rattigan) going in, and seeing director Delbert Mann's name made it all the clearer that this was going go be one of those ""classy"" American films of the 50s about a ""serious"" subject that got a bunch of award nominations - something in the same category roughly as the DRIVING MISS DAISY a generation later, or perhaps A BEAUTIFUL MIND from this era.  Typically, not the kind of film that I find myself enthralled in, though just as typically watchable enough.  And I was more or less right in my assumption.

The characters for the most part struck me as one-note. It doesn't surprise me really that Deborah Kerr was nominated for playing the repressed, borderline hysterical, browbeaten spinster daughter who forms a devotion to the (Oscar-winning) David Niven's exaggerated British military character - Kerr's role is the flashiest, along with Niven's, and the least interesting I think. I really did like Wendy Hiller as the hotel's manager - she brought real warmth and empathy to this rather understated role and she, too, won an Oscar for it - this one well-deserved. There's so much emotion there in the scene where she's telling the American writer who she loves (Burt Lancaster) that he needs to go to his ex-wife (Rita Hayworth, in maybe the best performance I've seen from her) because she needs him, needs him far more than the lonely but basically accepting hotelier.

Delbert Mann was one of the many directors of that period who specialized in such work - Joshua Logan was another - but though he was quite successful both commercially and critically (his MARTY won him a Best Director Oscar and Best Picture 2 years earlier), many of his films seem rather stodgy and un-cinematic now; a director like Vincente Minnelli or Richard Brooks, both of whom made excellent dramatic adaptations in the same year (SOME CAME RUNNING and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, respectively), might have brought this some needed energy and panache.  Then again, it's fairly low-key stuff and those flashier filmmakers might have overplayed it.  In any case, it feels to me overall a bit static and lachrymose.

But Hayworth and Hiller bring this up to some extent from the tepid and stagy camerawork and the rather obvious and predictable direction the characters are moving in, and the last scene with all the main characters gathered in the dining room as Kerr finally breaks (if only for a moment) from her domineering mother is also fairly powerful, so on the whole I can recommend this though I think you'd probably have to be a fan of some of the actors here to really get into it.  Perhaps I'll get more out of it too when I've gotten closer to the ages of most of the characters (and I'm not far off now); this really is a story that will work best, I think, for those who have lived a lot - and have filled up with regrets that make looking forward almost impossible.",1288915200,3,2951,4.670520231213873

844613,5,6304308418,"I've let this one mull around in my head for a while, because quite frankly I wasn't sure what I thought of it when I saw it all those months ago (it's been nearly a year).  In fact, I think I let too much time go by, so much so that I actually rewatched this the other night to refresh my memory and confirm my sentiments.

David Niven deserved the Oscar, just not in that category.

The film is one of those that I didn't really remember too fondly, but as I watched it again the other night I found myself remembering liking it.  You know those films, the ones that you really enjoy only to find that time (and your memory) was unkind to them, and then, as you watch it a second (or maybe even a third, fourth or tenth time) you realize that you liked it more than you remembered.

That was this film for me.

The films takes place on a seaside hotel that hosts a slew of very different and very interesting characters who all happen to become a major part of each others lives.  As scandal breaks out on all ends (most notably with a rumor involving a respected war veteran) the guests begin to fester and their relationships begin to fray and soon the controversy engulfs them all.  Loyalties are tested, emotions are bared and truths are accepted.

For me, half the enjoyment from a film of this nature is experiencing all of the twists and turns with a naivety that comes from walking in blind, so I'll refrain from giving away the plot any more than I already have.  I think that the less you know the more you can become swept away by anticipation and suspense.

I will say that the films final frame may be its finest.

The acting (for the most part) is outstanding.  The only sore point for me was a shocking one.  I usually ADORE Deborah Kerr, but I found her portrayal of the seemingly simple-minded Sybil to be clichd and aggravating.  I hated her handling of her character.  The rest of the cast was phenomenal.  Like I mentioned, Niven deserved that Oscar, but I have a hard time considering his performance a Lead performance.  I would have placed him in supporting myself (this is a true ensemble piece with no definitive lead character).  Hiller, Hayworth (scene stealing for certain), Lancaster and the devilish Cooper were all spot-on perfection.  Cooper is a hoot as the demanding and intrusive old-woman, and Hiller is devastating in her portrayal of a woman wanting what she fears she'll never completely attain.  While I personally give my supporting award to MacLaine in 1958 (I know the Academy went with Lead for her as well, but that performance has SUPPORTING written all over it) I cannot fret over Hiller's much deserved Oscar!

In the end I have to say that I am so glad I disregarded my ill-advised memory and watched this film again before reviewing it.  I fear that in a year I may have the same misconceived notion that this is less than I remember, but I will have no problems putting it back on and proving my memory wrong once again.",1262563200,3,2973,4.454713493530499

Every major character, however, is living his or her personal drama.

But the movie might very well belong to Deborah Kerr, who portrays a woman manipulated by her possessive mother.

844616,5,6304308418,"Another reviewer named this type of film, popular in the 50's as ""group therapy.""  I had to laugh at that because there is a certain amount of truth in it.  A varied group assembles in a site and each one, with his/her own personality defect gradually interacts with the others and a certain transformation occurs, at least in the main players.  Personally I love this format--find it much more satisfying than a lot of stuff that passes for art nowadays.

The setting is charming to modern eyes---a small, apparently modest residential hotel, located three minutes away from the sea in an unremarkable English town.  These people all seem to be suffering from something yet they keep up appearances grandly, and the hotel supports their various illusions.  It's a perfect place for secrets to be exposed as the folks encounter one another.

The cast is first rate.  David Niven is lovely as a fellow whose hearty old-style British bravura hides a desperate secret.  I'm usually bored by Niven but this performance is wonderfully done...especially the last scene.  Deborah Kerr is probably miscast as the frightfully repressed woman of an indeterminate age who is dominated by her scarey mother.  Kerr is too robust and healthy and naturally gorgeous to get away with portraying such an unfortunate person and her attempts at shy awkwardness border on charicature.  Rita Hayworth is very good as the aging but still glamourous model whose unexpected shows of kindness endear her to the audience.  Burt Lancaster is perfect as the failing writer turned alcoholic whose passion for Hayworth still flares up even after a terrible marriage.  Wendy Hiller plays the competent, smart woman who runs the hotel and has fallen for Lancaster.  All the others are well cast and played.  The only characters who didn't seem to add anything were the young couple who were on the verge of marriage.  Perhaps they were there to portray ""normal"" against whom the others played.  I thought they could have been eliminated.

This could have been terrible in the hands of lesser artists, including the director.  Fortunately it was so well done that a fine, sensitive, and satisfying film emerged.  The attitudes are dated so perhaps younger viewers may have a problem appreciating it.  Read the other reviews and make up your own mind.",1245715200,3,2317,4.994778067885117
844617,4,6304308418,"Some peculiar overtones in this film

I'll let you read about the plot in other reviews. Suffice it to say, although overtly this is a sweet film about lonely people finding each other, it has some decidedly peculiar overtones. It belongs to a type of drama popular in the mid 20th century, which I personally call ""group therapy.""  A group of relatives or friends--in this case the inhabitants of a residence hotel--has a status quo which hides their most secret feelings, acts, and incidents in their pasts. A catalyst occurs--in this case the arrival of a stranger (to all the residents but her ex-husband). Everyone reveals their secrets (voluntarily or not), and then enters into tears, recriminations, accusations, etc. By the end of the drama there is a new status quo--one that is not guaranteed to solve any of the characters' problems, but which enables life to go on.

But the most peculiar aspect of this film is the assumption that males are so hormonally driven that women owe them sexual satisfaction. Before the drama begins, one man's wife's sexual denials have led him to assault and a stint in a mental hospital (plus she divorced him). Her ""selfishness"" in not wanting to spoil her figure by having children (she is a successful fashion model) is castigated, and she has to show up at the hotel and repeatedly plead to resume their relationship, and this time, she has to agree to . . . well, you know. Early in the drama, another man's lack of a partner leads him to grope strangers in a movie theatre, which in turn lands him in jail. He is rewarded with a shy, younger, more upper-class woman he's always liked, but never had the courage to approach.

And sexual satisfaction is not all the film says males are entitled to--they're entitled to children, too. Another couple consists of a medical student who is perpetually exhausted by his incessant study of anatomy either in books, or on the girlfriend who keeps dragging him into bed. But that's not enough for him; he proposes marriage a couple of times a day. The girlfriend loves him, but is not sure she wants to be tied down by marriage. At the end _she_ has to agree to marry him and furthermore, have numerous children.

Meanwhile, a very nice woman (much nicer than the ex-wife) who is engaged to the first man, is completely left out in the cold when his ex-wife shows up. She wants him, but the ex-wife is much more beautiful and desirable, so she has to be generous and gracious. The filmmakers certainly aren't worried about the urges of any _females_ landing them in a mental hospital or jail.",1237334400,3,2582,4.6784140969163

Wendy Hiller is completely heart breaking as someone who is so afraid of loving (and with good cause it turns out) and yet so full of love for Burt Lancaster. Deborah Kerr, IMO, over-acts here, but has her finest scene in the final dining room scene when she finally separates herself from Mommy-dearest (who is also afraid of losing the one thing she has left). But the movie belongs to David Niven. OMG. The final scene where he comes into the dining room and tries to blend into the woodwork, make himself small and tight, drops his fork, tries to hide behind the menu...have you ever seen a performance that gave you as much pain to watch?

844660,2,6304308418,"This is Terrence Rattigan's character study of five individuals staying at a resort British town of Bournemouth. The setting of this motel is a symbol of a refuge for these five desperate characters trying to make their lives better, and staying out of troubles. The movie, directed by Delbert Mann, casts some of the best actors in Hollywood. David Niven won an Oscar award for his role as a retired Major (Angus Pollack). Mann is known for great comedic movies such as, Lover Come Back, and That Touch of Mink. His modest directorial role in this film is insufficient to make this movie interesting.

Ann Shankland (Rita Hayworth), a former model comes in search of her ex-husband John Malcolm (Burt Lancaster), who is currently engaged to Pat Cooper (Wendy Hiller), the manager of the motel. Other residents of the motel include, Sybil Railton (Deborah Kerr) an unassertive and frightfully repressed young lady living with her wealthy mother Mrs. Railton Bell (Gladys Cooper). She is casually befriended by Angus Pollack (David Niven) who has been charged with a minor sexual infraction in a public theater. As the lives intersect, emotions grow tense, providing all of the characters with their big dramatic moments. While David Niven offers a fine performance in this otherwise boring film, the viewers are some what bored by the role of Ms. Kerr who is known to have made some of the best movies Hollywood could offer. This movie is far from the magic of ""Here to Eternity"" that showed Deborah Kerr's love-making scene with Burt Lancaster on the Hawaiian beach.

Rita Hayworth and Burt Lancaster shine as ex-lovers forced to examine their pasts. Hayworth plays a passive woman in a reconciliatory mode who has not lost love for her ex-husband in spite of the fact she is engaged to be married again. Gladys Cooper is interesting to watch as she uses her status as a wealthy woman to control the opinion of the rest of the residents of the motel to throw Major Pollack out of the motel because of his run in with the law. The movie moves slowly in spite of some penetrating character study of the five individuals.

Instead of allowing this confinement to be too visually deadening, he makes beautiful use of mise-en-scene to keep the viewers' interest in the action of the work. Although it does seem stagebound, the film seems purposefully so: this is a film, after all, about the kinds of roles people play for one another when they know they're on display.

Mann's unwise decisions were not to take a stronger hand in the performances of several of the film's stars, particularly those usually excellent actors Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr who both here seem berserk. Lancaster is given the very stagey role of the character who rips others' illusions from them, telling them hideous truths while he clings to his own illusions, and he hams it up quite a bit, though not to the extent of Kerr. Although she made a career of superlative performances as hysterics (particularly in BLACK NARCISSUS and THE INNOCENTS), she shows none of the restraint an actress needs, and which she has elsewhere shown, to play a histrionic character effectively and believably. Surprisingly, Rita Hayworth, an almost staggeringly inferior actress to the other two usually, is much more effective as a sexually predatory and deceitful woman who can be capable of human decency; unsurprisingly, Wendy Hiller outshines everyone, in a thoughtful and beautifully modulated performance, as Lancaster's rock-steady fiance.

844735,5,6304308418,"This movie is a sensitive and refined treatment of the subject of Loneliness. The 'separate tables' are located in a small English resort hotel. The main characters live in their own little worlds, and their efforts at communicating with each other falter and fail. Most memorable is the character played by Burt Lancaster a formerly successful somewhat discredited writer who is engaged to the hotel's owner ( Wendy Hiller) but is troubled at the appearance at the hotel of his former wife( Played by Rita Hayworth)

There is a certain quietness and edgy bleakness in the movie.

It is an impression of life winding down in sadness, tastefully, politely, but nonetheless in loneliness and despair.",1147824000,16,698,5.060869565217391
844736,4,6304308418,"Wendy Hiller perhaps preserves best what we love about Rattigan's stage works, her dignity, her bitterness, the ""insideness"" of her despair, and her unfailing good manners and diplomacy.  She's excellent.  Most of the others, even Gladys Cooper and David Niven, seem to have been injected with essence of ham and turned loose on the set.  They are way over the top!  It's as though the actors were each trying to out-act the others in a giant free for all.  Rita Hayworth is probably the most obvious case of bad acting, but she is actually quite moving in her part.  Ann *knows* she's from a different world, *knows* that the others will resent her beauty, glamor and flame, so she's defiant.  And Haywrorth can break your heart even in her beauty, particularly as it began to fade after the Aly Khan years.  Here she's trying to whip Burt Lancaster (John, her former husband) into a sexual frenzy, and all of a sudden Rita--not Ann--doesn't really feel up to it.  Some say she should not be receiving top billing in this movie, but I disagree.  Watching her is the best reason to see this show.

The other reason is to see how American filmmakers tiptoed around homosexuality in the late 1950s.  Niven's character is a retired soldier who hangs around the hotel acting terribly British and stiff upper lip, while Deborah Kerr's Sybil hangs on to his every word though he doesn't seem to encourage her affections.  Then a small newspaper article appears claiming that he is in remand for a sex crime.  In the movie you never really find out what Niven has done.  All we know is that he was bothering girls in a cinema.  In a sense it doesn't matter what he's done, dramatically the point is that this crime separates him from respectable society, and the boarders of the hotel make up a petition to get Wendy Hiller to ask him to leave, and the plot hangs on whether or not Deborah Kerr will join the haters, or whether she'll forgive Niven for his attentions to the young girls and cast her lot with his, or whether her hateful selfish mother (Gladys Cooper) will prevail.

In the play, the crime Niven committed was picking up boys--underage boys of 15 ot 16 I guess.  Well, not picking them up but ""groping"" them.  I wonder how this would go down today.  Obviously it was too strong for moviegoers of 1958.  Would Niven have won the Oscar if he played some kind of homosexual deviant?  Would Deborah Kerr have pledged her love to him nevertheless?  What about Megan's Law--wouldn't all the other boarders have been able to track his comings and goings on the internet?  Rattigan's plea for tolerance is a loaded gun standing in the corner just waiting to explode.",1123545600,5,2667,4.625531914893617
844737,5,6304308418,"For lovers of this movie, keep an eye out for the alternate print, available only in the long-out-of-print 1987 CBS/FOX issue.  This version of the film has a different main title, with Rita Hayworth getting top billing, plus a new prologue at the end of the main title, before the film starts.",1097452800,11,294,4.653846153846154
844738,5,6304308418,"Produced in 1958 by Harold Hecht and directed by Delbert Mann, Separate Tables takes place at the tiny Beauregard Hotel, a seaside resort on England's south coast, which serves in the winter as ""a refuge for the lonely, resigned, and desperate."" The main feature of the hotel is its separate tables, rather than ""family style"" dining, for the guests. The cast is a who's who of fifties stars--David Niven (who won an Oscar for his role), Deborah Kerr, Bert Lancaster, Rita Hayworth, and Wendy Hiller (who also won an Oscar)--all playing characters who live as separated from the world as their tables are in the dining room.

 The Major (Niven) sets the action in motion when he is reported in the local newspaper as having been guilty of ""insulting behavior"" in a movie theater, and his war record is published. Niven is worshipped from afar by Sybil Railton-Bell (Kerr), a pathetically neurotic woman, subject to hysteria, who is totally controlled by her demanding mother. John Malcolm (Lancaster), was once married to former model Ann Shankland (Hayworth), who has suddenly come to visit him at the hotel, possibly to rekindle their flame, but he is already secretly engaged to Pat Cooper (Hiller), the manager of the hotel. A variety of eccentric subordinate characters add color, and occasionally humor, to the action. These isolated characters soon begin to find their lives intersecting and overlapping, and they eventually come to a poignant reckoning in the hotel dining room, as everyone arrives at his/her separate table.

 The cinematography (Charles Lang) and music (David Raksin), both nominated for Academy Awards, provide subtle emphasis for the character dramas going on in the hotel, rather than calling attention to themselves. Character dramas were less common in the plot-driven 1950s than they are today, and these characters will now be seen as stereotypes by today's audience, and their actions predictable. Sybil (Kerr) seems particularly unrealistic now, her constant refrain of ""Yes, Mummy,"" an insistent reminder of how times have changed. Lancaster seems a bit out of his element as a character actor, and Hayworth, in her buttoned up blouse, seems a bit uncertain about how to handle such a subtle role. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful study of actors and acting from the 1950s, and the writing (by Terence Rattigan and John Gay), direction, and cinematography, which showcase the cast, are superb. A classic film. Mary Whipple",1091232000,68,2460,5.157894736842105
844739,5,6304308418,"These separate tables and that discreet hotel I think are the equivalent to the abbeys of the Middle Age in Europe. In effect, not all people are strong enough to affront usual, daily life, with his defying , and some found by then a quiet way of life professing religion, believers or not, escaping of wars, abuses of the noblesse, etc. The lodgers of this film aren't religious, but excepting the writer played by Burt Lancaster the mundane personage of Rita Hayworth and the proprietary of the hotel, all others are people with a weak ego, unable for common life and some practically touching the tragedy, as the pathetic retired major who truly never fought, living of pure fantasy played by David Niven who has to find sex in dark cinema halls, and the poor girl represented by Deborah Kerr, annulated by her malignant castrating mother.
This movie moves me as I think people as these are more common than Herculean, steel heroes as usual, and at last, in his way, they are heroes also.",1088035200,8,991,4.668571428571428
844740,5,6304308418,A great film with perfect casting. The sound track was beautiful and particularly wonderful when Rita Hayworth is introduced to the viewer. The story is unique and has such a good message: The hateful mother is a warning to those who never see the plank in their own eye but see the splinter in their neighbor's. It was good to see that the majority of the characters were able to forgive the sins and bad choices the main character had made in his life. A truly fine film.,1076544000,9,473,4.386363636363637
844741,3,6304308418,"A varied assortment of guests sling gossip, secrets and loads of melodrama liberally around the rooms and grounds of an English boarding house. Profound? No.  Entertaining? For the most part.
""Separate Tables"" is what results when you mix ""Peyton Place"" and ""Clue.""  Everyone's a suspect for Most Noble Sufferer, and mostly the cast does well with the material given, even if in many cases the material doesn't deserve the quality of the actors delivering it.
Inevitably, some of the stories are more interesting than the others.  The Burt Lancaster/Rita Hayworth love-hate plotline grew tiresome in record pace---and too bad, since obviously this is the story the screenwriter and director were most taken with.  It definitely dominates.
I wanted more of the Deborah Kerr/Gladys Cooper storyline.  Deborah Kerr is a bizarre woman-child, unrecognizable in frump garb, dominated by her overbearing mother, Gladys Cooper doing her withering old biddie routine for the umpteenth time.  Cooper is a riot, an old lady with WAY too much time on her hands, eager to go witch-hunting at every available opportunity.
Poor David Niven is saddled with the role of a lonely British man pretending to be something he's not and trying to hide an embarrassing secret from the group. He wanders around in a smoking jacket doing his best Colonel Mustard impersonation, saying things like ""Wot, wot"" and mumbling lines to the point of unintelligibility. He inexplicably won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance (must have been a weak year), no doubt more for his body of work up to that point than for this performance specifically.  He has maybe 20 minutes of screen time altogether and for most of them is required to do nothing more than look uncomfortable.
The best cast member is Wendy Hiller, playing the proprietress of the hotel.  Her acting is natural and low-key, and she gets the chance to play a fully rounded character, one with some implied history, and not merely an assemblage of mannerisms.
The end of the film is a like a stuffy version of ""Dead Poets Society.""  I would have given anything to see Deborah Kerr jump onto a table and start clapping, but I guess these guests are a bit too reserved for that sort of thing, wot, wot.

844742,5,6304308418,"The production team of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster made film history by winning the first ever Best Picture Oscar by an independent with an offbeat film, ""Marty"", in which Ernest Borgnine secured a Best Actor statuette.  Some three years later the group with a penchant for strong but highly unconventional stories scored again with ""Separate Tables.""
Set in a boarding house in a British seaside resort, ""Separate Tables"" appraises the lives of people who often are seeking to escape from the real world, as well as those who attempt to oversee and manipulate others.  Two of the chief characters in the film fall into those distinct categories, David Niven, who won a Best Actor Oscar as a man who has manufactured a glittering military career and harbors a tragic secret, and stellar British character performer Gladys Cooper, a meddlesome presence who unearths that secret and seeks to have Niven evicted from the premises.  The chief reason for her determined venom is that Deborah Kerr, her tortured daughter who suffers from her suffocating domination, is attracted to Niven.
The drama also has a fascinating romantic triangle as an indigeouns element of its plot.  Co-producer Burt Lancaster plays an American writer with a tragic past who seeks to bury it in alcohol, spending the greater part of his time at a nearby pub.  His romance with the establishment's proprietor, Wendy Hiller, who secured a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her brilliant effort, is suddenly threatened with the arrival of a guest.  Rita Hayworth, wife of co-producer James Hill at the time, is from a more socially upscale society and appears out of place at the decidedly middle class boarding house.  She is a glamorous internationally renowned model.  Though she attempts to deny it, Hayworth is there to rekindle her old romance to former husband Lancaster, who in a fit of rage once attempted to kill her, doing prison time for his attempt.  We also learn that Hayworth's life has diminished from its earlier aristocratic pedestal.
The film was a melding of two Terence Rattigan one act plays, which he adapted to the screen with John Gay.  Delbert Mann directs with steadiness, allowing the drama to flourish without anyone going over the edge.  The sparks are there, but never in incredulous suberabundance.  The final mystery which is brilliantly unraveled is whether Gladys Cooper will prevail in getting Niven to leave the establishment after it is learned that he has been involved in a local scandal at a cinema.  The resolution is deftly handled, dramatic without histrionics, which was the hallmark of the entire cinema gem.  Deborah Kerr's future also hangs in the balance with her ultimate decision.",1040428800,30,2703,5.085972850678733
