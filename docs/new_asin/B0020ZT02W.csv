But for some reason it has had a poor release on all home cinema formats,however in the uk,we do have some good private sellers who have copies in widescreen and up to dvd standard,so I have been lucky to purchase a mint condition version,as for MGM`S ltd edition collection series I have 3 of thier dvd movies and so far all have been great,ok no chapters or subtitles and few details on the cover but great picture and sound,maybe I have been lucky,also I have a top of the range LED tv which is unforgiving of poor standard dvd`s and do not view vhs tape on it,so if anyone is not happy with what arrives,SEND it back.",1312588800,,775,4.426573426573427
8348766,4,B0020ZT02W,"This is not a review, but I have seen the movie on TV.  It's good.  As a matter of fact I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD for a long time.  Now I see it is finally out but only in a non-USA format.  Does anyone know why it is available elsewhere but not in the USA?",1263081600,,277,3.4918032786885247
8348767,5,B0020ZT02W,"When you think about John Sturges GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and THE GREAT ESCAPE immediately come to mind.  This thriller from the mid/late 1960's with George Maharis, Anne Francis and Richard Basehart is engrossing from start to finish.  In a small part as enemy agent is Ed Asner and an FBI agent James Doohan.  Why this isn't available on region 1 is beyond me.",1248566400,,410,4.589041095890411
8348768,5,B0020ZT02W,"The Satan Bug, starring George Maharis (of Route 66 fame) and Anne Francis is a very well made, taut thriller from start to finish.  Filmed in the 1960's, it managed to capture the edge of your seat tension not usually found very often in this genre from that era.  Based on Alistair MacLean's bestseller, it opens at a secret desert lab, housing experiments in germ warfare.  Along the way, a deadly virus with total lethality, the Satan Bug, has been developed.  So potent is this virus that, once unleashed, it has the ability to end all life, from micro-organisms to humankind, on planet Earth.  There is no antidote.  Worst of all, the Satan Bug has been stolen, along with six vials of life ending viruses effecting higher forms of life (ie. humans) before they dissipate.  George Maharis, a former CIA agent, is called in to investigate, track down the culprit, who is now blackmailing the world, and return the viruses intact.  The pace, dialog and action make this a very worthwhile addition to anyone's DVD collection...., IF ONLY IT WAS AVAILABLE ON DVD!  So far, it is not.  It is available on VHS tape, and can be copied, by those lucky enough to have DVD recorders, whenever it's shown on one of the cable movie channels (TCM has show it most recently).  I highly recommend this film to all those interested in action/scifi thrillers.",1238630400,2,1348,4.717948717948718
