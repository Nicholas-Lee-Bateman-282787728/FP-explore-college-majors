8426755,4,B004ECBSQA,"This Collection is over priced FT13 1-8 are all bare bones (first printing)
also these early dvd's were horrible in terms of PQ
FT13 1-4 look like the laserdisc's
the ""then"" newly commissioned art for 5-8 is cool but, that's it

The Friday the 13th series is great and timeless but, this Complete Collection is super over priced
But, what do i really know I'm a silly american consumer",1449619200,3,385,4.579710144927536
8426756,5,B004ECBSQA,I know if I had the money to pay for the Whole complete collection of Friday the 13th. I would pay the Price it is a steal. It is worth more.,1449532800,2,141,3.5806451612903225
8426757,5,B004ECBSQA,My son was tickled not only did they arrive quickly but they were in perfect condition and he could not be happier thank you so very much,1416268800,2,137,4.111111111111111
8426758,3,B004ECBSQA,"I watched all of the movies and all of them except one I thought was the dumbest,most stupidest one ever. The ninth movie,Jason goes to Hell,the final Friday was the worst one. It is NOT like the others where it is all at camp crystal lake. The people that worked on the ninth one could have done a much better job at filming and directing it. They could have come up with a better version. I would have liked to have seen behind the seens of the third film.",1407283200,,458,4.157303370786517
