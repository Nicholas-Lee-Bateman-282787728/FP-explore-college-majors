8488112,5,0933621027,Harrod Blank is now known as one of the most important driving forces behind the concept of the artcar. You will see in this video how there are many colors or flavours in the artcar world and that the artcar is an important medium accessible to all people. You need not be a trained artist or you can be a professional it makes no difference. The dream powers us onward. It is so wonderful to have a video which documents the amazing wonder of the way artcars relate to the society around us as personal expressions that everyone can plug into and enjoy. The interesting thing is that all this happens in personal garages and back lots in parking spaces on the road and on street corners. One of the few truly free artistic mediums left - there are far too many plain cars on the roads today. After you view this video you too will find your path to the dream! This is a great movie to introduce you or your organization to the artcar. A good way to begin planning an event or activity. For more on artcars visit the artcar epicenter on line. Search for hutman artcars and explore this dynamic world further. By all means purchase this video today. Buy a few for your friends interested in unique cars.- Conrad Bladey,986947200,3,1218,4.417777777777777
