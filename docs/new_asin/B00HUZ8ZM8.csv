8636148,5,B00HUZ8ZM8,"I'd give 10 stars if i could.  Francois Vecchio is a master craftsman and does things with pigs that I never imagined.  Good things, not gross things (get your mind out of the gutter).  He can debone and de-sinew a pork shoulder in minutes leaving clean, perfect salami meat.  His technique to remove and debone a ham was inspiring.  This is a great video for all hog butchers looking to improve their craft, and a must-have for all salumieres who don't have a master to learn from first-hand.",1451952000,,493,4.556818181818182
