7916684,2,B000035X8J,"Don't buy this, unless you've never heard of the Icelandic Horse. If you've ridden one before and are looking for actual riding tips etc, you won't find anything here.

Example: ""To do the tlt, the right move of you seat tells the horse to go into tlt"" - errr, ok? What kind of move? How? Where? When? Why?

It's only about 40 minutes long and it's just basically people riding around a barn with a voiceover that tells you the Icelandic horse is superspeshul and everything. Not actual information, tips, explanations of any kind (except maybe a tiny tiny bit on conformation).

The rest is just a very basic introduction. I'm not an expert, have only ridden a dozen Icelandic horses and don't speak Icelandic - and I knew much much more than what was said here. Too bad I bought it to get extra information. The cover says ""it will change the way you think and feel about horses and riding, you won't want to miss it"". Wow. I can't believe anybody wrote that with a straight face.",1401753600,,982,4.4748603351955305
7916685,5,B000035X8J,"I wish this DVD had been available before my trip to Iceland, which had included a few riding tours. For those use to the English or Western styles of riding it is a good introduction to the differences in the Icelandic riding style and the ""extra"" gaits. There is also a very information section showing the horse's conformation and explaining why certain traits are desirable.",1220054400,,378,4.8307692307692305
7916686,4,B000035X8J,"Anyone who wants a fundamental understanding of The Icelandic Horse and its natural gaits should buy this video.  It is chock full of ""light bulb moments"" for the novice Icelandic Horse owner.  The captions showing the varying gaits on a typical trail ride are a terrific learning tool.  Even Kristjan's accent is amusing.  You won't be disappointed!",1191888000,8,350,5.087719298245614
7916687,4,B000035X8J,"This video is a wonderful advertisement for the Icelandic breed of horse. It is a little expensive for the amount of time offered, but I would recommend it for most equestrian video libraries.
 I would also  recommend it for people with an interest in touring Iceland. The  explanation of the tolt and the pace are helpful, and the viewer can get a  good sense of just how fast the horses can travel.
 I've had some  experience with riding these horses in both Iceland and in the U.S., so I  was looking for more ""technical"" information. There is good  information on how to sit in the saddle, what is considered good  conformation, and a brief history. However, I would like to see more about  rein contact. I ride both balance seat (dressage) and western, and am  comfortable with the appropriate styles of holding the reins for those  disciplines. However, I still do not understand correct rein contact for  the ""higher"" gears of the Icelandic. Riders who have a saddle  seat (park seat) background may be at the best advantage for the Icelandic  style of riding.
 As stated, this is a nice showcase for the breed. The  film presentation is excellent.",963187200,21,1155,4.723618090452261
