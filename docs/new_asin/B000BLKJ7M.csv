In short he does not walk nor talk. This video was on constant play in his room and he LOVES it. If he is having a bad day of pounding his head or biting his hand, then this movie would bring him back around to the sweet boy we all know him to be. Before his mother passed away last year, she purchased EVERY SINGLE COPY of this movie she could find. Unfortunately, they have all been worn out now to the point that they drag. I am really, really, really hoping to be able to find just one more copy that we could convert to DVD's for him so that the tape will always stay good and wear out the DVD's instead. Any ideas of where to look would be so appreciated.  Thank you for your time.",1477353600,,858,4.017543859649122
