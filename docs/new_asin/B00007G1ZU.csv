7975987,5,B00007G1ZU,"We love this dvd. I must say this was a great find! My daughter and I really enjoy watching this. It has a nursery rhymes section which she loves!!! The way the nursery rhymes are presented are in the form of a play and the songs are very jazzy which gives it a twist to how we are used to hearing nursery rhymes very entertaining! a storytime section with all our favorite children's stories like the little red hen, the lion and the mouse and more, bedtime section is quieter and singing time section is very upbeat. My daughter and I love the storytime section and nursery rhyme section! It captures my daughters attention and she watches it during quiet time. Love it and recommend it for anyone who has a two year old when you both need quiet time.",1326585600,,753,4.385714285714286
