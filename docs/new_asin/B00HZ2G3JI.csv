6243779,4,B00HZ2G3JI,"Swimming videos for adults are hard to find and this is a decent one.  It seems a labor of love.  The instructor is clearly skilled and the demonstrating student is patient and composed.  If you are a beginning student or have issues of fear or comfort, this video should be great.  It shows basic drills on one disc and more advanced drills on the second disc.  The video is shot in a small pool, acoustics were not the best but very decent.  The video is well shot.  If you've had any lessons, this video will feel familiar.  Because the pool is small and the student is instructed to swim across the pool, I found myself wishing I could see more of the stroke.  The DVD, played on more than one machine, had a few freezes.  The instructor has a delightful accent that sounds like a mix of French and Australia, doubtful that's it, but that's as close a description as I can muster.  Very occasionally, she's hard to understand, but even less so when played on my computer rather than my TV.  I can recommend this video for all the positive reasons that people have expressed.  I can also recommend that you look into the Total Immersion DVDs, too.  They are not as hand-holding, but would be a good supplement. They have an amazing approach to swimming, but you need to be pretty comfortable in the water before you attempt Total Immersion.  I took a Total Immersion class once and could have drowned.  They gave me a refund and I realized that I wasn't as far along as I needed to be for the class.  I was at the level of this Learn How to Swim video.  We need more videos like it.",1415491200,7,1585,4.351535836177474

The instructor is clear and concise with explanations of technique and why it works.

6243781,5,B00HZ2G3JI,This video was very helpful.  The pacing of the instruction is excellent.  I am currenlty taking lessons and this DVD filled in a few gaps.,1403740800,4,139,4.52
6243782,5,B00HZ2G3JI,"I am very thankful I bought this video. My husband nearly drowned as a child, and as a result, never learned to swim.  As we are going to Lake Tahoe this summer, we figured it was time he stop being afraid and learn. This video was well organized, and the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. My only regret is that you cant watch a DVD while in the pool, but I just made notes on each section and took those with us to the pool where I became the teacher! Each technique was sound, and my husband picked it up really quickly. He used to be scared to death of the water, now he cant wait to try water skiing on the lake this summer! We actually loaned  it to our friends for their teenage daughter and now shes swimming too! Will definitely buy from this seller again. THANK YOU!",1396224000,6,791,4.163398692810458
6243783,5,B00HZ2G3JI,"Swimming is a year-round activity, from indoor swimming in winter, family vacations, to beaches and pools in summer. Swimming was not exactly my thing; when I took my first lesson I failed. I have not had this DVD for long but but I can see progress and the natural progression of one lesson building on the previous one. it has changed my whole thinking about swimming and has improved my swimming tremendously. it is a great way to learn for adults. think of it as swimming for grownups. It taught me how to breath, position my body correctly, and to relax and enjoy swimming. The program itself teaches basic swimming skills and you will learn to love the water.  So no matter what age you are if you want to learn how to swim this 2 Disc DVD would be very helpful for anyone wanting to learn how to swim.",1394150400,7,808,4.386666666666667

8637384,5,B00HZ2G3JI,Learning how to swim as an adult can be overwhelming and sometimes a little embarrassing. But Im glad I took the time to check out this lesson.
