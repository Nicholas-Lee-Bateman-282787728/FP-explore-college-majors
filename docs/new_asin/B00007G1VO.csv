1808637,4,B00007G1VO,"If you're not familiar with the Bellydancer Rania and her Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series, she is an AFAA certified Fitness Instructor and internationally renowned bellydancer. Her four part workout series fuses bellydance moves with a variety of different Western musical rhythms in her belief that bellydance can be done to any kind of music. With soundtracks not always coming off as authentic sounding as one may like, you'll have to use your imagination a bit when you hear the `Disneyesque' and sometimes cartoonish sounding strains of Hip Hop, Salsa, and R & B. The Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series are a set of fun workouts and a great way to interject life into a dull and stale workout routine.

Before beginning each workout it's important to keep in mind what these are -- workouts. Although you will learn some bellydance, as all of the routines are nearly completely comprised of bellydance moves, don't expect to buy this DVD and have it be your one-stop shopping for instruction and workout. They haven't made anything like that yet. The pacing required for instruction is way too slow to get your heart rate up for a cardiovascular or fat burning workout. Rania does a very good job of  creating routines with moves using similar muscle groups, starting with a slower tempo to teach the move and then returning quickly to full tempo, layering all the movements together to create an interesting routine. Lots of repetition will give you plenty of great bellydance practice.

Each one of the four follows a similar format and vary only in specific content and theme. Pure Sweat is the ""Latin-esque"" flavored bellydance workout and, of the four in this series, is by far the lightest workout. Try this one first if you're really out of shape. If you're no stranger to excercise, save this one for your 'light' excercise day. The music is more `tropical' sounding than Salsa as it claims; you could imagine the soundtrack being written by Disney. A couple of the bellydance moves featured here are similar to Salsa moves and with slight styling variations could easily be transposed -- further proof that learning one dance will help you in the learning process for another. The Bonus section features Rania's veil and cane dance as well as her Turkish 9/8 count Rompi Rompi dance from ""Bellydance Divas"" and has the 10 minute Abs Isolation segment from ""Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss: Daily Quickies...5 Ten Minute Workouts.""

The workouts are set in a studio and Rania is backed up by a small group of dancers in matching workout attire w/ hip scarves -- similar in look and feel of the Crunch workout series but without all those annoying logos. The back up dancer's bodies are all variations on different female body types with some being curvy and some skinny, and at least one should look how your body could look if it were in a little better, but not rock hard, shape.

Each of the four workouts has a warm up of roughly  5 minutes. 20 minutes is spent on each disc devoted to instruction and routines. All four finish with a cool down and stretch segment of approximately 5 minutes in length. My biggest complaint is that I wish workouts were longer in length. 30 minutes just isn't enough for me to keep the fat molecules at bay. I would rather the workout be an hour in length and I could always quit part way through on days I have only 30-40 minutes to workout. Also, studies show that the body does not even begin to burn fat until after 20-30 minutes of sustained cardiovascular activity.

Not a lot of explanation is given to the individual bellydance moves but nearly everything is done in half-time to start before moving up to full tempo. Rania's voiceover often gives pointers as to how the moves are done but one would need to either be a little bit familiar with bellydance, or have a dance friendly set of coordination skills. Nearly anyone could eventually pick up most of the bellydance being done on these DVDs with enough patience and practice. Even without doing the moves perfectly you'll still have fun and get a good workout. Only the beginner absolutely new to all forms of dance would be truly lost. Some of the names Rania gives to certain Bellydance moves are different than I've heard them called before but this is common in the dance world where dancers come up with a move and patent the only part people can't `steal' -- the name. Don't let this bother you; it happens in Bellydance, Hip Hop, Salsa, et all. The move is probably the same thing you learned in class just with a different name.

Probably the biggest complaints about Rania's DVDs are concerning her stiffness, often vacant look, and inability to sustain a heartfelt smile. The look and smile I just consider window dressing for a video; I'm certainly more concerned with her ability to dance and teach. As far as her stiffness goes, it does have one advantage here -- a slightly stiff body is actually easier for a beginner to follow because lots of extra movement is distracting to the beginner who is merely trying to get the essence of a move down pat. While it may irritate an intermediate to professional dancer to watch, the beginner will benefit, and although Rania is certainly not the most fluid of dancers, the routines in the bonus section will attest that some, but not all, of her stiffness comes from making the workout moves look simpler. This is, of course, a fitness video for beginners.

In all, each of the four workouts are fun and you'll learn a little bit of dance. I just wish they all were longer.",1109462400,3,5564,4.710174717368962
1808638,2,B00007G1VO,Rania's tapes are well-produced but this one did not make me sweat and it was much harder to follow than the Hip Drop Hip. I felt more like a club dancer than a belly dancer. Maybe it was my lack of connection with or inspiration from the music? I did not like this one very much. A fun fitness workout and I like the fact that she repeats things but I felt that some of the movements weren't explored/explained or done slow enough or enough times before trying to choreograph them into a tempo routine.,1106870400,2,503,4.3052631578947365
7976000,5,B00007G1VO,I ordered this DVD after already owning the VHS version. The DVD is more affordable on amazon than the actual website where they are sold. If you want to learn to do some basic belly dancing in the privacy of your own home...this is for you!,1395792000,,241,4.260869565217392
7976001,5,B00007G1VO,"I've owned this workout for a long time, and from reading some of the reviews, I don't think people got the point of this DVD.  It's not a solely instructional DVD, it's a workout.  The moves still get broken down, but the point is to get exercise, not so much to learn moves for a performance routine.  However, I will say that over time as you do the workouts, you DO start to remember moves, and you can put them into your own sort of routine, if you wish.  Something I like to do is also dance to the additional performances that she puts on her DVD's.  To each their own, of course, but I think people would find this workout more enjoyable if they look at it as getting a workout than an instructional how-to in belly dance.  I personally like it because if I've stopped working out for a while and then get back into it, this is a nice DVD that doesn't wear me out, but still makes me feel like I did something.",1394323200,,918,4.15819209039548
7976002,2,B00007G1VO,"there was hardly any instruction whatsoever - the workout was good, but you'd need to know all the moves already or you'd be lost.  she doesn't break down any of the moves before bringing them up to speed either.",1232496000,,212,4.435897435897436
7976003,4,B00007G1VO,This is a moderate workout. It gets your heart going and you will sweat. You will work your back and your calf. This is a good DVD for beginners. This is NOT a corny DVD and it's a lot of fun! There's also a bonus abs workout on the special features. It just shows you how to do variations in crunches.,1231200000,,302,3.9672131147540983
7976004,1,B00007G1VO,"Skip to the end if you want to watch belly dancing, and if you want to learn belly dancing skip to another video.  It really was a waste of 30 minutes in which the only belly dancing move taught was the shimmy.  The worst part of the video is how Rania shows off at the end with an actual belly dancing routine, nothing of which was taught in the video.  I've heard about her before, but with this video as my first impression, I fail to see why anyone would buy her videos.

She is a terrible instructor.

IN COMPARISON....
Although Dolphina's belly dancing instruction fell short of what I was hoping for, I actually walked away having a better understanding of belly dancing and belly dancing basics.  With Rania, it was just complete disappointment.  Dolphina at least instructed while she danced and had a smile on her face.  Rania unenthusiastically danced, with minimal voice over instruction.

Basically, Dolphina's video is something I will watch again and I think I'm sending Rania back to the yard sale I bought it from.  I can only hope the next belly dance video I buy doesn't get worse than this.",1218240000,,1110,4.588832487309645
7976005,2,B00007G1VO,"I own about 115 workout videos, and I bought this one last night, and it is almost horrible.  I couldn't believe how short it was, I didn't sweat at all, and Rania's VACANT expression and mediocre at best dancing skills were really irritating me! lol  I feel like I wasted my money, I hate that!  I usually read reviews on here before I buy, but for some reason didn't on this one, unfortunately.  I can't imagine even the most inexperienced person enjoying this video.",1194825600,,469,4.5476190476190474
7976006,2,B00007G1VO,"The moves are done to generic ""Latin music""; I usually find this kind of fusion to be fun, but this video's music sounded cheesy to me (though it may suit some other people's tastes).

The moves didn't feel or look great.  Not only were the moves not interesting, they were not strenuous, and they were very repetitive. So unless you're a slower learner that likes to practice the same move over and over again, you will likely find this video very boring.  The only other advantage to this repetition is theoretically you are working your muscles more intensely.

I feel that she lacks personality & stage presence, which makes also makes the workout boring. A strength of this video is that the 4 other dancers in the video are pretty good, and they do the moves well and look like they are having a good time (instead of Rania's blank stare).

The MAIN WORKOUT includes the following moves:
*  Warm Up including Hip Slide & Hip Twist
*  Grapevine (this video is not for you if you have limited floor space), Step Twist, Side Step then Hip, Travel fwd l w/ Side Step Hip, walk back with shoulder shimmy, Duck Walk, Double Back/Front, Hip Shimmy.
* All Together Dance Routine
* Cool Down/Stretch

BONUS SEGMENTS:
*Abs Isolation (This was the BEST part of the video - Very effective 11 min segment includes Ab Squeezes(very interesting), crunches, oblique twists, revese crunches w/ legs up, legs extensions, leg scissors, leg bicycles)
*Rania performs Egyptian veil dance & traditional Turkish folk dances
*Workout to music w/o narration",1183939200,,1538,4.799242424242424
7976007,1,B00007G1VO,"The concept of using bellydancing moves to salsa music is an interesting one, but with this video it just doesn't work. And I don't understand where the 'Pure Sweat' comes from. I've broken out more of a sweat sitting in the shade on a summer's day than I did with this. The workout is as slow as the warm-up, and it didn't last long. Rania herself is kind of scary, with (as someone else put it) her deer-in-the-headlights look, and her obvious lack of actual bellydance training is annoying. Another reviwer stated that Rania's stiffness in her dancing is helpful to beginners, and I could understand if that was her goal, but she is stiff in the final part where she dances full out on her own, so it comes across that she is someone who took a few bellydance classes and decided, ""Hey, I could make a video that people will think is fabulous, and I'll get lots of money!"" And that's disturbing to me.

So, if you're looking for a video that either instructs bellydance, or is a bellydancing workout, I highly recommend the 'Bellydance - Fitness for Beginners' series by Veena and Neena. They have a grace and fluidity of movement that shows they know what they're talking about, and their Slim Down video really does get my heart pumping.",1122422400,5,1242,4.569506726457399
7976008,2,B00007G1VO,"I recently started working out again after having had a slipped disc.  I needed to start with something light yet exciting enough to keep my interest.  So, naturally I thought this dvd would be perfect.

I barely broke a sweat in this workout, so everytime I see the cover, I break into a laugh.

I expected to have some authentic belly dance moves.  I've taken a class of beginner's belly dance and I guess I expected something along those lines.

This dvd left me feeling cheated out of my money.  Now, I feel hesitant to buy another belly dancing dvd workout.  Maybe I just need an intermediate dvd workout.....Hope this helps.",1109808000,4,630,4.612612612612613
7976009,1,B00007G1VO,"I enjoy bellydancing classes and I wanted to be able to practice at home.  This was not the right DVD to accomplish that goal.  In fact, I am not sure what this DVD would be right for.

The music is terrible--canned, tinny, and unenthusiastic at best.  The idea of doing bellydance moves to Latin music is interesting, but the least they could have done is get some real, electrifying Latin music.  This is bellydance to Muzak.

As others have mentioned, Rania does not appear to really enjoy being in this video.  Her blank expression led my husband to ask whether she was the person doing the voice over.  I paid more attention to one of the background dancers who seemed to be far more enthused to be in this video than the ""star"".  Another of the background dancers was definitely enthusiastic; however, her shimmies looked more like a cartoon character ""vibrating to a stop"" than a dancer performing a technical move.

The moves themselves bore little resemblence to the bellydancing I have seen or been instructed in.  Oh, some of the basics are there, but to call this a bellydancing workout is giving it airs.  The most bellydancing I saw was when the dancers entered the studio before the workout began.  The actual workout steps were much more basic dance steps.

Finally, I failed to work up any sweat doing this video, and I am not fantastically in shape.  After losing patience with trying to sweat to the instruction sections, I skipped to the end where the simple sequence of moves is repeated several times.  Perhaps I was too annoyed by the other things listed above to do the steps with the intended vigor, but after completing the entire ""set"" twice, I still wasn't breathing hard.

I suppose if you are looking for gentle dance motions set to nondescript music, this video might be for you, but don't expect to learn bellydance or hone your technique with this one, let alone find a serious cardio workout.",1109548800,13,1926,4.684523809523809
