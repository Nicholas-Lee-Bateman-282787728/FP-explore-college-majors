In this DVD it does have more information in it that was not shown on public television. Also, in the DVD they did interview a bear hunter and go to their home. I didn't realize that there was the possibility that this could happen (feeding bears and petting them), not that I will be trying it any time soon. Hopefully other people are smart enough to realize that this is not something that the every day person should be trying.",1470182400,,586,4.241071428571429
8636361,5,B00HVBFJF2,"We started watching this while our 7 & 9 year old grandsons were visiting; They are into computer games and somewhat violent although science based videos, but the next thing we new, they were sprawled on the sofa and the floor, transfixed!  We bought this CD so they could finish watching it at home and they have now watched it through 3 times.  I loved it, think it is phenomenally educational about black bears and as we live in the country with black bears around (Goldilocks came up on the deck, put her paws on the window ledge and looked in the dining room window) guess how she got that name.  We all need to learn to respect these bears and let them live in peace.  Incidentally, contrary to the adage ""a fed bear is a dead bear"", black bears do not normally raid trash cans etc.  Although bears that have little natural food will look for food else where - wouldn't you?  Check out bear.org for accurate information.  This is the place where Mr Buchanan based his filming.",1440547200,,983,4.4581005586592175

8636364,1,B00HVBFJF2,"First off, this film presentation does not deserve even a single star!
I know many people are interested in wildlife, and nature as a whole. Quite a few of these folks have very worthy intentions in protecting The Great Outdoors, but the program ""The Bear Family & Me"" produced by the BBC does not serve that end. It was recently broadcast on many PBS stations across the United States. You would have been best served if you had missed the show. Don't waste your money purchasing the program!

Admittedly, I have an unabashed respect and fascination with bear species of all kinds. Sure, I like lots of different animals, but I was interested in seeing what this particular show was about, having personally seen quite a few bears out in their natural surroundings over the years. I am aware that the bear researcher Lynn Rogers {who is an associate/contact in this three part film presentation} is a very controversial fellow, but this show with its special host [Gordon Buchanan], a cinematographer from Scotland, takes controversy to a whole new level. While the guy initially expresses some very, very minor hesitation toward being intrusive to the subject of his film, he charges right ahead, full bore, and makes a blathering fool of himself. This guy is the Timothy Treadwell of black bears!  I might have hoped that P.B. S. stations would have come out with some sort of retraction/clarification regarding the irresponsible actions portrayed in this three (3) hour program, but I rather doubt that that is to be. Will some members of the public now find it in their benefit/danger to pursue the actions presented by this fellow in this bizarre and problematic program?
Does Gordon hesitate to feed the bears? No! Does he withdraw from invading the personal space of the bears? No!!  Does he allow the bears to get very close to him and then touch them? Yes!!! Does he ever mention in his film that black bears have killed more people than grizzly bears {sure there are more black bears around today than grizzlies, but still there is a significant danger in habituating any animal}? No! Gordon and Lynn apparently have no problem with habituating these bears. Feeding wild animals is an extremely unhealthy and unwise thing to do to any wild animal, of any sort. Gordon has the same pathetically naive, simplistically juvenile, attitude that got Timothy Treadwell (and his girlfriend) killed and eaten! How sweet that Gordon brings his family to Minnesota to meet the bears in one of the segments of the program... I'm rather surprised he doesn't ""paint"" some peanut butter on one of the kid's faces to get that precious film footage of a bear coming in to lick off the goo. [Is that actually just an urban legend of a situation that once took place at Yellowstone?] Aaahhhhh, as I write this it's just one of the first days of summer, time will tell what irresponsible behaviors the ignorant might conduct against wild animals in their habitat! I'm NOT suggesting that bears (of any kind) are ""monsters"", but they most assuredly deserve our respect and a very healthy distance for their own well-being and ursine satisfaction in the environment.  Yes, protect their habitat, but don't do really, really, really stupid things to endanger their own sovereignty, threaten any sort of retribution against them, and also, in the process, bring harm to humans too.

This is a very irresponsible and regrettable film program and people should be warned about its potentially harmful aspects. It's magnificent to spend time outdoors getting to know the true essence of the natural world, but it is more than a silly playground and holds some very serious consequences for those possessed with erroneous perspectives about what exists out there. More people need to become familiar with the story of Timothy Treadwell as ""Grizzly Man"" to know what possibly evolves out of naivety.
I would hate to see the public be further exposed to dangerous attitudes concerning animals in their environment. We are not dealing with Yogi Bear and precious creatures out on an incredible journey. If we in the modern age attest to being truly concerned about the essence of the outdoors, there is a responsibility toward forwarding programs that do well for the world. The program ""The Bear Family & Me"", filmed by Gordon Buchanan and produced by the BBC fails completely in taking that mission seriously.

8636366,3,B00HVBFJF2,"The run time is listed at 150 minutes while the UK copy of the same Is listed at 176 minutes, which is actually rounded down a smidge. In addition, the UK edition includes a 59 minute bonus episode of the series Natural World entitled Bearwalker of the Northwoods, while there is nothing in the US product description about this. Can anyone with a US copy confirm the running time and whether the bonus documentary is included?

I prefer to buy US copies so I can lend them to friends who don't have all region gear, etc., but if this product description is accurate, then we're better off with the UK copy.",1398211200,5,607,4.468468468468468
