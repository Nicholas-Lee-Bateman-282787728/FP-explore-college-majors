4107031,3,B003BLPEHY,"Here's hoping the picture quality is better than this
shoddy-looking packaging. I was pleased that Warner
has already upgraded their MOD dvd-r releases to look
more like a first-rate release, with original release
artwork that spreads out over the entire package.
These ""generic"" covers, with their plain text titles
look more like the ""home brew"" or even pirated variety.
Come on MGM/Fox. Don't go cheap on us now!
  As for the quality of the actual print used, I will
be surprised if it isn't the same as the Orion VHS prints,
just bumped-up to dvd quality. We will just have to wait.
In Japan (country of origin), this series was completely
remastered, but had no dubbed English audio and was very
expensive! I watched this series on streaming on
my Netflix account back in 2008 and it looked terrible!
Pray it is mercifully better than that muddy looking mess!
*update: June 2012-Two years after being announced, MGM has
finally locked a price for the 7 disc set: $24.99 (currently).
I have already put in my pre-order and will be anxious
to finally have this long lost 70's series from my youth!",1269820800,9,1100,4.7539267015706805
4107032,5,B003BLPEHY,"I'm really happy that Amazon and MGM(The owners of Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot) are officially releasing
this series to dvd. This will be the first time the series has made it officially to dvd here in the United States.
Please give us a reasonable price point-I'd say not more than $30 tops for the entire series(I'd prefer it to be between $19.99-$29.99). Especially when the Ultraman box set for 39 episodes only costs around $10-15!

Thanks Amazon and MGM!

Come Giant Robot!!!!",1269648000,8,488,4.7976190476190474
8393766,5,B003BLPEHY,"Dammit,now what's the holdup? Its been one delay after another. Can't we get it right? When is the release date for this?",1349827200,,121,4.545454545454546
8393767,1,B003BLPEHY,"Grab a hold of something. Your bubble is about to go..............POP!!!!.
Go to AV Maniacs DVD forum and you will see that MGM has ended their MOD for a second time!!! Please notice, that Amazon is no longer taking orders for this. More bad news. MGM has started leasing some of their catalog titles to the worse budget label ever-----TGG Direct  AKA Tiger Direct. Check out Amazons listing for The Dr. Goldfoot Double Feature DVD, the company releasing info lists MGM/TGG. These are already in some Walmarts and K-marts.
Now the good news.  MGM has licensed ""some"" of their catalog to the great DVD label Shout Factory. ""Terrorvision"" is one of the titles. AV Maniacs and a few other DVD forums have a more complete list.
My suggestion is to send a email to Shout Factory and asked them to release this great fun show. I would also suggest that if they can get the rights from MGM, to include ""Voyage Into Space"" which is a movie version of Johnny Sokko made up from the first few episodes. ""Voyage Into Space"" is how some of us got into Johnny Sokko since where I lived in the 70's we didn't get the show.  MGM has truly frustrated many fan , like me, with the constant ""we're going to release this, OH! no we're not"". I wish studios that use the MOD method of releasing their older films on DVD would wake up and realize that charging $19.99-$24.99 for DVD-r's is too much. $9.99-11.99 is about right for a MOD DVD-r barebones release.",1347667200,6,1439,4.505747126436781
8393768,5,B003BLPEHY,This was the best fiction movie of all time. When I was a child i would really cry when he had to fly into space and kill him self. Every time was a tear jerker. (lol) Great movie for family time.,1346025600,,196,3.8048780487804876
8393769,5,B003BLPEHY,This brings back the memories! First watched the movie (Voyage Into Space) on Creature Feature back in the 70's. I believe the plot and concept of the Power Rangers sprung from this series which became a movie. Giant Robot is cool!,1345334400,,231,4.658536585365853
8393770,5,B003BLPEHY,"I saw this in the 70's as a Kid and LOVED it as well as Ultraman. Give me a break I know you can release this so just get off your kester and let's get a move on!! People are waiting?? I'll be one of the first in line. I am 45 and not getting any younger, if you can re-release frickin Footloose and Fame ect, ect. You can find the Japanese Masters and get a move on? Thanks and get it out SOON.

8393771,5,B003BLPEHY,"MGM, please let's get this on DVD!  It is a small but dedicated asset in your vast Film and TV archives.  You'll sell lots of units.  Please provide a release date.

About these reviews, well, other fans have a lot to say.  They still remember how much they enjoyed it.  Therefore, providing reviews is not a bad idea.  This was a great childhood TV series for me and I'd like to share it with my kids before they get too old.

MGM, a release date please!",1311897600,,455,4.209302325581396
8393772,1,B003BLPEHY,"Yes, I have to ask again how six people can add a review for this DVD set when there isn't even a release date listed yet?  You are reviewing a product that doesn't exist just based on the generalities surrounding the source material.  This should not be a review of show itself but of this DVD release of the show.  There are several different listings for Johnny Sokko DVDs and these reviews would be applicable to any of them if you are just reviewing the series.  These reviews should be about the specific products listed so people can deceide if they want to buy them or not.  They most likely already know if they like the show or not or they wouldn;t be here in the first place.",1276992000,5,686,4.328125
8393773,5,B003BLPEHY,"I really can't give a lot of information on this release, with no release date. But I would comment on the series. Johnny Sokko has been one of my favorites next to Ultraman. I know this is being release on dvd-r, so what. Also it won't have the Japanese language on it, but prefer the English version anyways. I'll say this the only way I'll buy this set if its within 25 dollars range. If more, then they could shove-it.",1270944000,4,422,4.2875
8393774,5,B003BLPEHY,"I hope this actually becomes available soon. I ordered it for download
and, after charging me, Amazon informed me that it was not compatible with my Mac. (What century are you guys living in, half the population owns Macs.)  Now they are saying a DVD-R release is coming. No regular release? Why? I'll tell you why. Because whoever is in charge of these decisions is probably 25 - 30 years old and has no idea that this Sokko is popular and personally thinks its terrible. The fact that BCI's Ultraman DVD's didn't do as well as hoped may also be a factor. Of
course the the fact that the Ultraman DVD's were of bootleg quality,
and that BCI fed the buyers all sorts of lies explaining why they were so bad, is probably not known to MGM/Fox.
I know that they have good prints of Johnny Sokko. I have seen a couple.
They are not exactly the same as the original broadcast versions, but they were definitely taken from the same prints or inter-negatives
that the originals were.
I really, I really want this. Johnny Sokko, and Ultraman are my favorite show's of all time, and I know a lot of other people who feel the same way.
Why do the keep cheating us?
I'm praying that we don't get cheated by Fox, the way that we got cheated by BCI.",1270252800,17,1236,4.35064935064935
8393775,1,B003BLPEHY,"I was VERY excited when I saw this up on DVDDrive-in! However, when I discovered it was going to be a MOD DVD-R I was very upset indeed. MGM/Fox have really dropped the ball here. This could have been a deluxe box set, maybe a Bandai type mini figure could have been included, bonus features - Photos, commentaries..NO! The packaging looks like ""I don't care, it's only a Japanese TV show"". Heaven knows what the picture quality is going to look like? Take a look at what other studios are putting out Fox. Sony have been doing superb work with their titles. While some of the indie studios are doing superb work, too, Severin and Synapse comes to mind here! Please get your act together and do these films justice. And how about another Vincent Price box set???",1270166400,9,762,4.528985507246377
