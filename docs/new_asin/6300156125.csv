7803403,5,6300156125,"I loved this video as a child, and now my kids love it too! It really helped them learn the nursery rhymes that we now sing together! And the visual learning of it helped them understand what the words meant, and the words are on the bottom of the screen while they are sung which is great. They love mother goose in the video, she has a really sweet grandma like voice.",1344902400,2,370,4.152777777777778
