977932,5,6305161879,"I first saw A Fish Called Wanda ages ago and thought I was going to hurt myself laughing! I have watched it numerous times since then. And each subsequent time the film did not disappoint! John Cleese is a master of comedic timing, whether it is the classic ""Double Take"" his wonderful control of a ""Pratt Fall"" , ""The Department of Silly Walks"" or his classic "" Lumber Jack"" routine. He most surely is a Master. Jamie Lee Curtis has many facets as an actress but she most surely hits her stride in comedic roles. She is terrific as the conniving unscrupulous manipulating ""Gold Digger"" she portrays in this film. Kevin Kline is the perfect foil for her! His paranoid and delusional character portrayed exceptionally well by him IS perfect for this film. He too, blossoms in this comedic role. There are very few actors alive who could have portrayed this character and carried it off so well. Finally we are ready for Michael Palin who is also a true Master. So-o-o-o . . . . .With a mix like this and stars of this caliber you can't miss.having a laugh fest! I love it, and this film will end up being a ""cult"" classic. Enjoy!

978099,5,6305161879,"As I post this review (on 12/11/17) I see 500+ reviews posted under this listing. But, that is because Amazon has a weird policy of gathering ALL versions and formats of a film and putting them ALL under the most recent version. Hence you will see reviews doung back to 1999! (Yep, the VHS version). So I always recommend they people sort by the most RECENT first (not by stars) and look to see which version is being reviewed.
Yes, you can use older reviews for the plot and acting but thats it. This review is of the NEW Completely restored version of the film by the British Arrow Home Video imprint in their Classics series. (Distributed in the US by MVD Distributors).

Not only does this fill look great, but there are HOURS (literally) of bonuses  some old, some new. The 108-minute film, which was written by and stars John Cleese (Monty Pythion/Fawlty Towers) and was  co-directed by Cleese and Charles Crichton (responsible for great Ealing Studios comedies of the 1950s), looks and sounds GREAT. There is a full length commentary by Cleese (I haven't gotten to that yet),  48-minute British documentary from 1988 on making of film, a 15th Anniversary documentary from MGM also on making of film and running about 40-minutes, Another documentary on Location filming and then a new 18 minute appreciation by BFI Vic Pratt. Oh yeah, the trailer, a gallery of photos and a trivia track. And a booklet with two detailed essays on the film.

I think I last saw this film on VHS (in addition to seeing it in a theater) and only remembered a few scenes (mostly Jamie Leigh Curts seductions). What I didn't remember was how much graphic language was ion it. Its common today but be prepared. Only nudity is Cleeses rear end. And there is violence but its cartoon violence as if Frank Tashian or Chuck Jones directed the film.

If you love this film and want to see it again as close to the condition it was in when it was released in 1988  and enjoy the HOURS of bonuses, youll want this one. Next up for Arrow is a newly restored version of The Apartment

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

978102,4,6305161879,"Fish Called Wanda / Dirty Rotten Scoundrels / Throw Momma from the Train.  This compilation DVD set of three popular 1980s comedies, greatly appealed to me because I love Fish Called Wanda and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, had to replace VHS tapes I gave to charity.

Fish called Wanda, of course, has a trio of talented  comic actors: John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline plus: Michael Palin, also of Monte Python fame, enacting a wacky plot.  An American woman flirts with a crook, a barrister and a mercenary to find diamonds in London. Kevin Kline took home an Oscar for his performance as a self-absorbed lothario who prepares for lovemaking by drinking in his own ""manly"" musk. However, the entire cast of this hilarious comedy is perfect: John Cleese as the conservative barrister defending a member of sexy Jamie Lee Curtis's gang, Ms. Curtis as the conniving crook out to grab the haul for herself, and Michael Palin as the stuttering, animal-loving hit man whose attempts to murder a little old lady only decrease the size of her poodle pack. Cleese cowrote the  script with British comedy veteran Charles Crichton (The Lavender Hill Mob), whose smooth direction balances Monty Python farce, hysterically tasteless gags, and an unexpectedly romantic subplot with style and confidence.

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels also has a trio of three talented comic actors playing off each other: Michael Caine and Steve Martin, both of whom I adore, the late Glenne Headley, who may be a bit overmatched in this company, and as bonuses Anton Rodgers, Barbara Harris, directed by  Frank Oz. A rich little town on the French Riviera in season is too small for Caine and Martin, both conmen who prey on nave American women: they hilariously fight it out.

Throw Momma From the Train stars  Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kate Mulgrew, was  directed by Danny DeVito.  This is a comic take on Patricia Highsmiths brilliant Strangers on a Train. De Vito is studying writing in Billy Crystals adult education class; as in the Highsmith original, he wants Crystal to kill his bullying mother; in return, he will kill Crystals inconvenient wife. This lackluster comedy always fell flat for me, still does.

But the price is great, and to quote Meatloaf, two out of three aint bad.",1511395200,,2278,4.93455497382199

Crude, not funny. Wooden dialog. Kevin Kline's character was of course a bad guy, but so irritating and stricken with ADHD that any scene which included him was unwatchable.

978207,4,6305161879,"Id forgotten just how funny A FISH CALLED WANDA was. Yes Id seen it when it was released, watched it on both video and disc but it had been a while. With this new releases Id thought about the film as being funny but didn't remember how funny it was. I found myself having to pause the film on occasion because I was laughing so hardand then backing up moments to watch and laugh at them again.

The story revolves around a group of thieves who have successfully pulled off one of the biggest armed robberies of all times. Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) is the head of the gang, Ken (Michael Palin) his stuttering relative, Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) his girlfriend and Otto (Kevin Kline) the muscle of the group and Wandas brother. Except that he isn't really her brothers but her boyfriend whos there to help her steal the entire haul.

Setting up Georges to take the fall he is arrested. Unbeknownst to the pair he took precautions and moved the jewels from the safe they were in and passed on the key to its new location to Ken. Ken hides the key but Wanda finds it. The only problem is she has no idea where the safe deposit box is that the key belongs to. To find out she decides to seduce the barrister handling Georges case, Archie Leach (John Cleese).

While all of this is going on Georges tells Ken he must help by taking out the witness who claims she saw him commit the robbery, an elderly lady who owns three yorkies she holds dear. His attempts and failures at trying to follow through with this leads to some of the funniest moments in the film though the dark comedic nature of what happens will undoubtedly upset some viewers.

Wandas seduction of Archie goes as planned with a few hitches thrown in thanks to Otto. Otto is one of the funniest characters in the film. Not quite a dim witted as some might think but definitely close, Otto considers himself an intellectual because he reads things like Nietzsche and takes high offense to anyone calling him stupid. His jealousy of anything involving Wanda leads to some more hilarious moments.

As the movie progresses you begin to wonder just who will end up with the jewels by the final credits. Characters found to be living in situations they're unhappy with (both Wanda and Archie) will find resolution while others will be left to face the consequences of what they do. None of them will come out unscathed in one way or another and along the way all will provide so much laughter youll find yourself like me, pausing to recover from time to time.

Fantastic acting is found by all here with special note to both Kline and Palin who create two memorable characters that will make you laugh when remembering them. Cleese has written a comedy masterpiece here and was even nominated for an Oscar for this work. Curtis displays a flair for not only playing the femme fatale but showing she has the acting chops to pull it off. In all the movie shows that the right combination of wit and slapstick can be combined to make one of the best comedies of all time.

Once again Arrow Video has outdone itself offering a 4k restoration of the film for the cleanest look possible. Extras abound here and include a commentary track with writer and star Cleese, an appreciation by Vic Pratt of the BFI National Archive, interviews with composer John Du Prez, production designer Roger Murray-Leach, executive producer Steve Abbott and makeup supervisor Paul Engelen, a 1988 documentary on the making of the film called JOHN CLEESES FINAL FAREWELL PERFORMANCE, SOMETHING FISHY a 15th anniversary retrospective documentary featuring numerous interviews, FISH YOU WERE HERE a documentary on the films locations hosted by Robert Powell, 24 deleted and alternate scenes with introduction by Cleese, A MESSAGE FROM JOHN CLEESE a hilarious short recorded for the films original release featuring Cleese, a gallery of stills, a trivia tack, the theatrical trailer and for the first pressing only a booklet with writing on the film by Sophie Monks Kaufman.",1508716800,,4017,4.705547652916074

978209,1,6305161879,This movie was recommended to me as being hilarious...I don't see it. Only watched the first 15 minutes of it.,1507939200,,110,4.55
978210,5,6305161879,"Having all the wit of a Monty Python film (how could it not with Cleese writing, starring and member Michael Palin in the case) but also a surprisingly effective romantic subplot (not exactly Monty Python territory and I can imagine that director Charles Crichton probably helped with this), ""A Fish Called Wanda"" remains the high point of Cleese's movie career outside of the Pythons.

Cleese plays barrister Archie Leach (Cary Grant's real name) who finds himself dropped into the middle of a robbery gone wrong, hidden jewels and two American con artists (Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline--both delightful) who are trying to rip off the gang they were a part of by finding out where robbery suspect Tom Georgeson hid everything. Cleese's character falls for Curtis' character while Kline's character thinks that he and Curtis are together and Michael Palin's character is put in charge of killing the only witness who can identify Georgeson--bungling it at every attempt.

The Arrow release marks a big upgrade compared to the MGM. The MGM was a singularly unimpressive high definition transfer so Arrow went back to the original negative restoring it in 4K. This is a nice looking transfer and the audio sounds quite nice as well with an uncompressed 5.1 DTS-HD transfer.

The special features truly put this into five star territory (the film itself is five stars by itself).. We get ""John Cleese's Farewell Performance"" a documentary on the production of the film. We also get vintage interviews and a 15th anniversary retrospective documentary. ""On Location"" focusing on he shooting locations for the film. 26 deleted/alternate scenes with introductions by Cleese and ""A Message From John Cleese"" a amusing introduction released in 1988. A trivia track, theatrical trailer, reversible sleeve and a booklet with an appreciation and essay on the film. Finally we get a commentary track from Cleese. The film features optional English subtitles.

A marvelous comedy, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" receives the deluxe treatment that it has always deserved so you can get rid of the lackluster MGM disc.",1507852800,,2097,5.140762463343108
978211,4,6305161879,"A Fish Called Wanda stars John Cleese (Monty Pythons Flying Circus, Fawlty Towers) as Archie Leach, a weak-willed barrister who finds himself embroiled with a quartet of ill-matched jewel thieves  American con artists Wanda Gershwitz and Otto (Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline), stuttering animal-lover hitman Ken Pile (Michael Palin), and London gangster Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson)  when Thomason is arrested. Only he and Ken know the whereabouts of the diamonds, leading to plenty of farce and in-fighting. Archie is hired to defend Thomason.

Essentially a caper film with oddball characters, the movie was filmed in England, but financed by an American company. What should be a modest little comedy is made to look grander than it is. The humor is quirky, much like its characters, but its given a lavish production that clashes stylistically with the script. The attempt to blend droll British humor with broad American farce is a difficult mix. Not meant to be the greatest caper flick of all time, it relies on offbeat characters as its primary attraction.

John Cleese is probably one of the funniest comedians in the world. But not in this film. Instead of the stiff upper lip, supercilious manner combined with heavy doses of silliness hes so great at conveying, hes not given material to tap into these strengths. We expect a Pythonesque performance, but instead we get a fairly tepid portrayal. He does get some laughs, but they're nowhere near the kind his Ministry of Silly Walks, Dead Parrot or Cheese Shop sketches have elicited.

In a plot lifted from The Ladykillers, Palins Ken Pile spends a good deal of time trying to kill the only witness to the robbery, a little old lady (Patricia Hayes). The humor derives from his repeated failure to complete the task. Palin is effective at conveying a loopy, eccentric character  the last person youd want for a partner on a jewel heist.

Bonus materials on the R-rated widescreen Blu-ray release include commentary by writer and star John Cleese; a 1988 documentary on the making of A Fish Called Wanda containing interviews with actors Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and director Charles Crichton; a 15th anniversary retrospective with interviews; a look at the films locations; 26 deleted and/or alternate scenes; tongue-in-cheek introduction from John Cleese recorded for the films original release; trivia track; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1507075200,,2477,5.192982456140351
978372,5,6305161879,always awesome,1505606400,,14,6.5
978373,4,6305161879,"Comedy is often a matter of taste...or lack thereof.  John Cleese was an innovator in bad taste as part of Monty Python, brilliantly mixing rude humor with polite British wit.  But as the decades passed, humor caught up with his genius, even surpassing it in terms of lowbrow laughs with BBC shows like The Young Ones.  As timeless as Python's sketch material was, it just didn't feel fresh anymore.  But the unexpected success of A Fish Called Wanda (1988) proved that clever comedy and vulgarity could still co-exist; in fact, they felt fresher than ever.

Cleese plays Archie Leach, a sad sack of a British barrister stuck in a loveless marriage, whose life is re-invigorated by the appearance of Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), an American law student who finds him inexplicably attractive.  Wanda's motives, however, are professional not personal.  As part of the jewel heist that kicks off the film, she's milking Archie for information about his client - and her lover - Georges Thomason - who's hidden the loot somewhere in London.

But the situation is much more complicated than that.  Wanda's been playing everyone against each other, including her other lover, Otto (Kevin Kline), a hired gun with an IQ in the single digits, and Ken (Python alum Michael Palin), a stuttering animal lover who's been charged with eliminating the only witness to the crime:  a cantankerous old woman and her three vicious Yorkshire Terriers.  The film's finale becomes a race to see who will double-cross whom and make it to the diamonds before the rest.

But as nasty as some of the humor can be in A Fish Called Wanda, it's also a throwback to the ensemble Ealing comedies shepherded by its director, 78-year old Charles Crichton (who handled the technical side of things while Cleese handled the actors), with dialogue bouncing back and forth like a well-choreographed tennis match.  Cleese, who also co-wrote the screenplay, is working from his sketch comedy roots, imbuing each character with easily recognizable quirks and catchphrases that pay off from scene to scene.  And he casts himself in a far more adult - and romantic role - than he'd ever played before.

In that sense, he relinquishes the biggest laughs to Kevin Kline, whose enthusiastically idiotic performance is the most amusing aberration in his career.  Otto's interrogation of Ken, which involves him eating a tankful of tropical fish, is (PETA be-damned) one of the funniest 5-minutes ever-captured on film.  It's the characters' reactions that punctuate the jokes, from Archie's shock at being caught naked in a stranger's flat to Ken's continuing agony as he accidently kills one innocent Yorkie after another.  A Fish Called Wanda proves an old dog can learn new tricks.

Although it's never been hard to find on home video, Arrow offers up a whopper of a special edition that starts with a brand-new 4K restoration from the original negatives and several bits of new supplementary material to go along with extras carried over from previous editions.  As far as the new stuff goes, there's a video appreciation by Vic Pratt of the BFI National Archive and interviews with composer John Du Prez, production designer Roger Murray-Leach, executive producer Steve Abbott and makeup supervisor Paul Englelen.  Recycled material includes a Cleese commentary track, 1988 Making Of, 15th Anniversary retrospective, 24 deleted / extended scene with Cleese introductions, still gallery, trivia track (remember those?), theatrical trailer and collectible booklet.",1505606400,,3519,5.13859649122807

978776,3,6305161879,I just watched this again a few days ago when it came on one of the cable channels.  I hadn't seen it in awhile.  And it is still just as funny.  Kevin Kline Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cleese are all excellent.  But Michael Palin who at the time was the least known to me is hilarious.  As a stuttering hit man. And him and Kline together have the best scenes.  When he tries to kill the lady  witness and kills her dogs.  How can you not keep a straight face.  Especially the third one who dies in a loony toones sort of way.  This is a great movie that holds up all these years.,1490054400,,579,3.9565217391304346

The plot involves a diamond robbery.  Jamie's character, Wanda, had conspired to keep the jewels completely for herself.  She was sleeping with both the man who planned the robbery - George, and weapons expert needed for it - Otto.  She had Otto turn George into the police, then planned to Leave Otto with nothing.  To her shock they found George had moved the diamonds without telling anyone.

Michael Palin's character, Ken, was George's right hand man. He loved animal animals to the point of fanaticism.  He was tasked with eliminating the main witness for the trial.  In the process he kept mistakenly killing her dogs, one by one.  Though he hadn't any problem killing an old lady, he was heart broken over every dog that died.  Hilariously when the last died, the old lady dropped dead from a heart attack.

Cleese played George's lawyer, Archie.  Wanda proceeded to seduce him to get more information, but they genuinely fall for each other in the process.  Otto was violently jealous of them.  His jealousy resulted in several hilarious attacks on Archie, both before and after Otto located the diamonds.

981290,5,6305161879,"A Fish Called Wanda is a heist-comedy film about an ambitious con artist who uses her sexual wiles to obtain a fortune in jewels stolen by George Thomason,her gangster lover. The movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis together with Kevin Kline,Michael Palin and its co- screenwriter and director,John Cleese.

London-based gangster George Thomason and his right-hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist. They bring in con artist Wanda Gershwitz and ""weapons man"" Otto West, a loud- mouthed Anglophobe who fancies himself an intellectual. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but they hide this from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them. The robbery goes well, and the thieves get away with a large sum in diamonds. But the ambitious con artist uses her sexual wiles to obtain jewels. First, she romances Georgeson's dimwitted but deadly henchman. Then, to clear the path for her getaway with , Jamie woos Georgeson's starched- shirt attorney whom she genuinely falls in love with.

No question about it that this film will definitely provide the viewer a great viewing experience. It has strong performances from its solid cast especially Kevin Kline,who won an Oscar in it. Also,the screenplay was smartly written and engaging. The change of genre in the story is what is definitely surprising as it started as a heist movie and later turns out to be more that what it appears to be as it becomes more complex afterwards as we get to see the goofiness of the characters afterwards. It is definitely a vintage classic comedy.",1432598400,,1592,4.892592592592592

981778,4,6305161879,"I avoided this blu-ray transfer for quite awhile, with quality concerns based on several o the review here on Amazon.
Not to fear - it was perfectly adequate, in fact, OK (one you got past the opening scenes on the first ""reel"")

The transfer was actually on par for other low-budget films of the 80s. The audio track, despite its DTS transfer, remains fair. It's all front end loaded with poor differentiation between speakers. Volume had to be turned up for speaking, then turned down for those synth outbursts in the soundtrack.

As noted, the film contains no extras - these would have necessitated a DVD to accompany the blu-ray.

I didn't feel the need to make any additional adjustments on either my player or projector. The picture quality, contrast, saturation (surprisingly) were all good. No one will ever mistake this for a transfer on par with, say, Finding Nemo, but then again - anyone who is expecting that is a bit naive.

Hmmwhat does Nemo go well with? AAaahhhh..chips!",1423353600,9,988,4.794117647058823

981780,4,6305161879,"Only the second half of this farce is funny, so is it worth enduring the leaden first half? Absolutely. There isn't a single laugh until John Cleese shows up to stay, which he doesn't really for quite a while. But once he becomes the center of the film, and once all the supporting characters' ticks have been primed for callbacks, the laughs arrive and they are persistent. A farce has to escalate, through unlikely coincidences and misunderstandings, to the point of sheer madness and then beyond. ""Wanda"" does that. By the grand finale every character is deeply enmeshed in his or her own particular neuroses and has taken them farther than seemed possible.

The big one, the ripe target that Cleese must have had foremost in mind when he wrote the film, is Kevin Kline's perfect caricatureno, perfect encapsulationof a Nietsczhe-reading, Ayn Rand-worshiping, ugly American Libertarian. His arc, which culminates in the most incredible set piece ever played out on an airport tarmac and is capped off by a wicked reference to Apartheid as the credits roll, is the most delightful takedown of that kind of person ever likely to be committed to film. He even has the douchey hat and soul patch that make up the unofficial uniform of America's most unjustifiably hubristic keyboard warriors.

But Kline is not the only great element of the movie; merely the greatest. Michael Palin's dogged quest to assassinate an innocent old woman is probably one of the boldest things I've seen in a comedy, because what he murders instead is even more outside the bounds of cinematic fair play. It is the kind of thing that could lose the audience and make the movie an unpleasant experience regardless of any other consideration, and for some sensitive viewers that is probably the effect. But most will forgive it, because the utter excess of it all, and Palin's horrified reaction to his errors, turn the darkness into rich dark comedy. Palin's character has a stutter, which is another dicey area to tread, but the jokes involving his speech impediment are meant to be at the expense of others.

Rounding out the cast, Jamie Lee Curtis plays a double-dealing jewel thief with a quirky fetish. Hers is probably the silliest and least funny of the movie's threads, and the awkwardness of seeing her lock lips with every character and several inanimate objects never fully wears, or pays, off. But she serves as a catalyst for Cleese's own antics, which include a Basil Fawlty-esque scenario in which, for reasons that are all quite logical, he is found dancing stark nude and speaking Russian at the top of his lungs by a proper middle-class family who looks on in horror.

It takes a while for ""Wanda"" to come to that and to the other juicy bits, but they are worth the wait.",1423094400,,2766,4.816842105263158

My first opportunity to laugh came in at about 50 minutes in.  John Cleese does a bewildered frightened stare like no one else.  The dialog in that scene was funny.

From a stuttering would-be assassin with a soft spot for animals (Michael Palin) to a wickedly opportunistic American femme fatale (Jamie Lee Curtis), we meet the funniest rogues gallery in modern film history. Kevin Kline delivers a tour de force with his Oscar-Winning portrayal of Otto, a self-important hothead whose jealous rants, misquotations of philosophy and smug bullying could power any three comedies; no less impressive is John Cleese as a desperately unhappy barrister whose long-embalmed passion for life (the 'loveless-marriage-personal-grooming-before-bed' scene is as brilliant as it is off-putting) may be about to get a blood transfusion. File this one next to Blazing Saddles on your 'best comedies ever written' shelf.",1403568000,,844,5.76

982932,2,6305161879,"I've heard praise for this movie, and heard about how it was supposed to be a fusion of Monty Python and 1950's-60's Ealing comedy.  Unfortunately the end result was as appealing as chocolate-covered bacon (yes, I saw that featured in a restaurant I went to).

The basic story is about a group of diverse people-two Americans, two Britons-who rob a British bank, and inevitably betray one another.  One gets arrested and Cleese plays his defense counsel, initially believing him innocent.  But to the frustration of the others, the one in jail has managed to conceal the robbery's takings, and the others scheme to find out where they are.

Unfortunately the comedy depends on shock humor including crass stereotypes of loud, obnoxious Americans and comatose Britons, and overacted so that the movie tends to be more annoying than genuinely funny.  As a crime drama, it isn't very clever either.  In the end, the movie is barely passable and certainly doesn't live up to the hype it received.",1402876800,,992,4.9397590361445785

983047,5,6305161879,"Virtually no movie deserves five stars. Then why did I give this film five stars? Because so many of the movies listed here have four stars and plainly don't deserve four stars, and I needed some way to differentiate. To be more precise, I'd still give Wanda four and a half stars. But that is not an option in these Amazon reviews. I've watched this movie multiple times and it stays as funny as ever. The plot is absurd. A few scoundrels have cooked up a plan to rob a bank. John Cleese as a barrister mocks British formality better than just about anybody. Jamie Lee Curtis is both as funny and sexy here as she is in Trading Places. Of course she and Cleese fall in love. Very few actors could pull off the surreal insanity of Kevin Kline in this role. The story is filled with absurdities and coincidences you would find totally unbelievable if you saw them anywhere else, yet somehow they manage to stretch your disbelief to within a hair's breadth of breaking, but not a millimeter further. What makes this movie so ""watch-able"" is that, unlike so many other ""caper"", ""chase"", and serious crime movies, after the robbery the thieves turn on each other. It's fun to watch from the first frame to the last.",1400284800,,1211,4.509090909090909

Kevin Klein has a knack for playing anybody's foil.  This is even more evident paired with John Cleese.  Jamie Lee uses her womanly wiles to distract even the most reserved.  Cleese's ability to write, act and direct (although uncredited), allow for him to slip on the persona with ease.

A Fish Called Wanda is not for everyone.  You might not want to watch it if you have no sense of humor... or you're dead.",1399939200,,622,4.5
983049,5,6305161879,"Released in 1988, A Fish Called Wanda was hailed by critics as a very funny film. And they are correct; the movie is extremely enjoyable. John Cleese and Kevin Kline play off of each other very well and are easily the best part of the film. The film has a plot, which isn't as common as you'd think when it comes to comedies, and it's a good one. The final ten minutes are some of the funniest ten minutes I have ever witnessed in a comedy.
The DVD, which was released by MGM/Sony in 2004, is a well-made 2-disc set for fans of the film. The transfer is good, and the extras, which include a documentary, tons of deleted scenes and a ""farewell performance"" for John Cleese, are good as well.

It was very interesting to watch cleese character come to the conclusion that his marriage was a failure, and it was time to make an exit.

Kevin Kline updates the shoot-first-ask-questions-later, crude, American cowboy routine to an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Animal lover, Michael Palin, accidentally kills three small dogs.  And Jamie Lee Curtis proves that all men can be hypnotized by a little cleavage.

""A Fish Called Wanda"" is one of those movies that never really caught on, oddly. Part of the
reason is John Cleese's popularity for Life Of Brian. And all of those outrageously funny, and
yes, fairly blasphemous films.  Jamie Lee Curtis also has so much competition from her own
countless films, like ""Perfect"", that her other movies also overshadow Wanda. Kevin Kline
has made so many popular films that a lot of people don't know this Charles Chrichton flick.

I don't previously know some of this other great supporting staff in A Fish Called Wanda. Michael
Palin should have been noticed for his stutter in the movie, which is an impressive acting feat.
Some stutter for the camera better than others, and Palin has it down to an art.  So everyone
of the main characters including Palin is a criminal. Kline is  a crook, too, but he is also a
sadomasochistic type, with a bizzare and dangerous ego. Kline got Best Supporting Actor,
but he always wins some kind of an award. It's just my opinion, but the awarded actors
seem to be in some kind of club.  Sophie's Choice probably put Kline in that club. I thought
that Palin deserved something, if not just for his zany revenge on someone with a steamroller.

Cleese plays the barrister, an English attorney. Who hates the protocol of his
profession, and is not thrilled with his personal life, either. The barrister(Leach) becomes
involved in a hilarious situation involving some jewelry that is very important in
the story.",1359763200,,1492,4.782101167315175

984393,5,6305161879,"""A Fish Called Wanda"" is considered a classic British comedy with American stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline as Wanda and Otto, two American con-artists, along with British actors and Monty Python alums, John Cleese, and Michael Palin. Cleese played British barrister, Archie Leach, who is enticed by Wanda Gurwitz. Wanda and Otto have even their partners conned into thinking that they're brother and sister as well. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken whose main mission is to off Ms. Coady played by the wonderful actress, Patricia Hayes. The film was written, produced, and co-directed by John Cleese and the late Charles Crichton.

Anyway, the cast is first rate and the writing as well. The direction is brilliant. Of course, BAFTAs went to John Cleese (lead actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor) and an Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role to Kevin Kline's unforgettable performance as Otto. In my opinion, Kline steals the film most of the time but they're all scene stealers. Kline's Otto believes he's smarter than everybody else especially the British. Jamie Lee Curtis is also unforgettable and believable as the woman who is crossing everybody else in the film for the jewels.

The first CD is the film. The second CD is the special features which include the making of the film; a message from John Cleese when the film was released; Robert Powell exploring the locations where the film was shot; the inception and completion of the film; alternate and deleted scenes with John Cleese pointing them out.

984459,3,6305161879,"It is extremely annoying when a title is re-released in Blu-ray format with no restoration, or for that matter with no improvement on the image quality provided by the original DVD.

This Blu-ray edition is far inferior to the original DVD edition, which used to have a number of interesting extras and the Blu-ray has absolutely none!

As to the film itself, in my opinion, it still rates as one of the best comedies ever to be produced for the cinema. A very clever story, by John Cheese, with tremendous dialogue and very good acting from all the principals. There are some exaggerations in the plot, but this is true of most comedies.

I noticed that the Blu-ray edition of this film will be released in the UK in August. I hope that after this long delay, this release will have the necessary improvements, especially in image quality, to make it worth a 5 star rating, and possibly induce one to acquire once more.",1329436800,6,1212,4.685446009389671

984464,5,6305161879,"A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is for comedy what Citizen Kane is for drama, Godfather Part 1 and 2 for gangster epics, and 2001: Space Odyssey for science fiction  - it is one of the best in its genre. This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath.  The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from:  ""Disappointed!"", ""Don't call me stupid"", ""You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works"", ""You British think you are so superior"", ""What was the part in the middle?"", ""Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet."" ""When you say ""friendly"", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?"" There are many more.

A Fish Called Wanda is a real ""treasure"", and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. :) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review: ""The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does."" I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with.  John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the ""key"" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to ""meet with an accident, even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces ad her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, ""the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people"" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto.

You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more.  I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment.  I envy such death.

And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', ""If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the ""Marriage of Figaro."" (Translation is mine)

I just would add - or watch again ""A Fish Called Wanda.""",1290988800,5,5140,4.559046587215601

Unfortunately, this film falls into that category and while there are a few scenes especially between Palin and Cleese that drew a smile from me in remembrance of the great Python days the rest of the film was desperately dated and had me looking at the clock wishing it would end.  1988 must also have been a very bad year for films as that would explain how Kline could win his Oscar.  Cleese is a funny actor but he is certainly not a scriptwriter.  From the opening credits that were in an off-putting deep blue to the horrible score and background music this film doesn't even begin well.  Highly overrated and a film that ages very, very poorly it isn't helped by this very poor dvd version with horrible mono sound quality and even worse picture quality that is full of white spots and other imperfections.  There are no special features to speak about like interviews or making-of documentaries as well.

It's actually embarassing that Cleese and Palin could actually put their names to this film given the vastly superior output that they were involved in from their Python days.

984653,5,6305161879,"I didn't think that I was going to adore this movie as much as I do; don't really know why, but my expectations were rather low.  I know, Kline had won the Oscar and so maybe that should have sparked a little more interest, or at least faith in me, but I still saw this as a movie I was going to be mildly enthused about at best.  I was so wrong, for as the film started rapidly drawing to a close I found myself uttering aloud ""this movie is outrageous"" and I meant that in a wildly good way.

The film tells the story of American jewel thief Wanda who uses her charm to seduce men whom she needs in order to get her hands on some very valuable diamonds.  Her lover Georges and his stuttering companion Ken help Wanda steal the jewels with the aid of Otto, another man whom Wanda has seduced and is passing off as her brother.  She has deceived each man into believing that her intentions are to share the jewels with them, when her intention is to take them for herself.  When Georges is captured by the police after moving the diamonds away from their initial hiding place Wanda begins to set her charms on Archie Leach, Georges barrister, hoping to find out the new location of the diamonds.  All the while she continues to string along each individual man, adding layer upon layer of lies to keep them pacified until she has all her ducks in a row so-to-speak.

But nothing ever works out as expected.

The film is hilarious from start to finish, a complete laugh-riot, and the performances by the entire cast are Oscar worthy.  Jamie Lee Curtis is adorable here, delivering what may be her finest performance ever.  She is sly, conniving, sexy and charming; never allowing her characters tricks to overshadow her performance but always playing to her strengths and delivering a brilliantly crafted comedic performance.  Michael Palin is also rather great as Ken, and Maria Aitken has a very memorable supporting role as Archie's wife Wendy.  John Cleese is golden as Archie, the lovelorn barrister who falls for Wanda's undeniable charm; but it is Kevin Kline (Oscar winner Kevin Kline) who steals this movie with his comedic delivery.  He is one-hundred percent on the top of his game here, delivering a strangely perverse yet fully fleshed out character who is unforgettable to say the least.

Oh yeah, and he is so the leading male character here, regardless of whose name gets top billing.

`A Fish Called Wanda' is, without doubt, one of the best films of 1988, and it is seriously one of the greatest comedies I have seen in a long time.  It hits every mark beautifully and creates an eclectic cast of characters who all feel real and all feel complete.

Written by Cleese and set in London, this comedy has the drama of a bank robbery and subsequent legal proceedings and a romantic twist.  Yet, this is not a ""chick flick"" by any means.  Cleese's Monty Python buddy Michael Palin delivers a stellar performance as the stuttering hold-up sidekick, as JC plays the barrister (defense lawyer) for the man who organized the robbery.  Again...since Cleese wrote it and sets it in London, there are only 2 American main characters (which in typical British form) Cleese busts on by giving them playfully negative American stereotypes: Jamie Lee Curtis plays a girl who will (let's keep it clean) ""hook up with"" and then stab in the back anyone who can make her rich.  And Kevin Kline plays an obnoxious, loud-mouthed vulgarian who pretends to be smart and classy, but truly shows no intelligence and is gauche and tasteless.  Don't take it too seriously though, my fellow Americans....this movie is great fun!  The story unfolds beautifully, and the subtly developing romance between Cleese and Curtis (which begins as an opportunistic ruse by Curtis that blossoms into something more) is handled quite well.  For fans of British comedy, there are also small appearances by other British stars such as Geoffrey Palmer and Steven Frye as well.

We follow them as they plot, and counter-plot against one another, leading to what is possibly the most hilarious torture scene ever filmed, and a number of awkward, aborted attempts at adultery.

984660,5,6305161879,"This is probably Cleese's best work, post-Python and post-Fawlty Towers.  It's still hilarious today, and it has something that most modern comedies don't even come close too...consistency.  Almost every joke works.  There isn't a dull moment in the entire film.  It is meticulously done by John Cleese and Charles Cricton.  Cleese wrote the screenplay, and Crichton directed it.  Crichton is best known for the great Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob (which is a wonderful film starring Alec Guiness).  I really like the digs that Cleese gets at the expense of Otto, here portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Kline.  Kline is so reminiscent of the pseudo-intellectual babbling that permeates many parts of our society today.  The scene where Wanda (Jaime Curtis) berates him for pissing off Archie Leach (Cleese's character, and Cary Grant's real name) is my favorite scene in the film.  Jamie says the line ""apes do read philosophy, Otto, they just don't understand it"".  Many read, many watch art films, important films, read big books, but don't understand a damn thing.  But Otto is so naturally stupid that his pseudo-intellectualism is funnier.

All of the players here are excellent.  Kline won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role (one of the few times a comedic performance won), and Palin is wonderful as K-K-K Ken (as Otto affectionately calls him), the killer who loves animals.  The film gets a bit nasty, but then it's British, so this is to be expected.  This film, despite a modern setting, is really reminiscent of Crichton's Ealing comedies, and I think that's what makes it very funny and special.

One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, ""Oh do shut up, Porche!""  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very ""Monty Python"" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.

Twenty years later, I still laugh out loud at his performance.

I believe Michael Palin won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well--and he's hilarious as well!

(I've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged: Peter Sellers should have won for DR. STRANGELOVE and Steve Martin should've been at least nominated for ALL OF ME and then nominated for Best Supporting Actor for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.)

The film has a decent amount of big names, such as Kevin Kline, John Cleese, and Jamie Lee Curtis.  However, I just never really got into this.  The plot is well twisted so that is not the problem; however, I just lack the interest in the characters.

First of all, Michael Palin is just going off of the stuttering bit he did in Life of Brian. Moreover, and I never understood how anyone could be, every male character is heads over heels for Curtis, which just seems so unrealistic to me even in a plot.

Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) - feisty, the brains of the outfit, she can talk herself around anything; she's turned on sexually by foreign languages.

Otto (Kevin Kline) - the dumbbell of the group who reads philosophy and practices martial arts; reads Nietzsche's ""Beyond Good and Evil"" as if it were a CIA manual; so dumb he thought ""The Gettysburgh Address"" was where Lincoln lived.

Ken (Michael Palin) - has a terrible stutter and loves animals; spends the whole picture trying to kill an old woman who is a key witness only to wipe out her pet poodles one by one.

After all kinds of incredible and improbable twists and turns, the barrister wins Wanda and off they fly to Rio with the loot.

This is not a Monty Python film, even if both John Cleese and Micahel Palin act in it.

The first time I saw it I was disappointed: was this it? Then I saw it a second time, and could not stop laughing. Other people, including my wife, have reported the same experience. It improves with time, and you cannot say that about many films!

The acting is superb. Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis even steal the film from Cleese and Palin, which is a feat in itself. Kline has reportedly claimed that it was his favourite performance.

I think that the viewer has to be prepared that the humour might be inspired by the classical Ealing comedies, which moved in a border between the bizarre and the realistic. It is not quite Monty Python, but it is not quite mainstream either. Just take the absolutely absurd characters played by Kline and Palin: they just could, barely, exist in real life.

The story and the characters are more complex than one would expect from an ordinary comedy, and it might also be a reason why it takes a few watchings before the laughter erupts. Then, on the other hand, it becomes one of the truly funniest film ever made.",1112054400,2,1231,4.381578947368421
984940,4,6305161879,"John Cleese, of Monty Python fame, co-wrote the screenplay for this hilarious comedy caper along with director Charles Crichton, who also directed ""The Lavender Hill Mob."" Cleese is totally irreverent and has absolutely no clue as to the meaning of political correctness. Everyone and everything is a target for satire. Cleese also performs here one of the most side-splitting stripteases I have ever seen. I literally doubled-over with laughter!

A  twenty million dollar jewelry heist is pulled off in London's Hatton Gardens by four eccentric misfits, two Brits and two Americans. George (Tom Georgeson) is the ringleader, the man who masterminded the theft. He is the only one who knows where the jewels are hidden. His partners in crime include animal lover, Ken Pile, (Michael Palin), a socially inept bumbler with a stuttering problem. He loves his goldfish, Wanda, (named for the movie's heroine), with the passion most attach to their significant other. Wanda Gershwitz, (Jamie Lee Curtis), is George's girlfriend, who uses her formidable seduction techniques to get what she wants, and she wants all the money! Wanda finagles to bring Otto West, (Kevin Kline), into the gang, telling the others he is her brother - although like most other men in the film, he is her lover. And Kline is brilliant as the manic, Nietzche-reading, ex-CIA agent and Anglophobe. He is a self-styled intellectual, but is so stupid that he thinks the London Underground is a political movement. As Wanda remarks, ""He's so dumb he thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived.""

The ploys, dirty tricks and double-crosses Otto and Wanda use against their partners, to prevent their receiving a share of the loot, are classic. When George's lawyer, Archie, (John Cleese), falls in love with Wanda, her formidable skills at juggling men are seriously challenged. Cleese brings an endearing romantic touch to the smitten Archie. The situation grows more and more convoluted and the laughs build right along with the escalation. Otto is extremely jealous of any man who looks twice at Wanda, and obviously Archie takes more than two glimpses. Madcap madness!

I don't want to disclose any more of the plot here, but ""A Fish Called Wanda"" contains some of the funniest scenes I have viewed on film. Director Charles Crichton keeps the pace moving at a nice clip and the satire involving the cultural clash between the very proper, if somewhat stuffy English, versus the uncouth, aggressive Yanks is pure delight. At one point, Archie says to Wanda: ""Do you have any idea what it's like to be English? We're all terrified by embarrassment. That's why we're all dead!""

This flaky farce is a must see! A definite 5 star film, I am rating this only 4 stars, however, because of the poor quality of the DVD. I advise renting the movie and waiting for the re-release before buying this comic masterpiece.

My absolute favorite part, which doesn't give anything about the movie away, is near the end when John Cleese imitates an American accent.  Usually we see comedians here making fun of British, French, and other foreign accents, so it was fun to see someone try to imitate us here in the States.

Interesting to see how things lightened up in comedy in the 90's compared to this 1980's flick about crime.  There were definately some very funny scenes, Kevin Kline showing up all the time was really fun, wondering what he would say when he did, and the gem to me was Michael Palin chasing after a witness that he trying to off.  That had me in stiches.

985040,4,6305161879,"John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline for...being in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called Wanda
Curtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her ""brother"" Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.
A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit. It's actually very funny.
Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.
Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis (one of my favorite actresses)was excellent in a comedic role. Of course, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.
It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.
A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.",1044057600,5,3105,4.647272727272727

Even after a nearly a century, Charlie Chaplin is still cutting edge as far as British humor goes. That's what makes this movie such a delightful surprise. Just like in ARTHUR, British humor is fully realized when Americanized--just like Black humor is best when written by Jews--- and this, combined with John Cleeves's finsest hour, makes this a comedic classic that can go yuk for yuk with any flick!",1041292800,,571,4.607843137254902
985133,5,6305161879,"This classic 1988 British comedy, which was written by and stars John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, Monty Python), has got to be one of the funniest films of all time, and it is certainly one of my favourites.
Briefly, the story involves four criminals who steal a fortune in diamonds.  One ends up in prison (having been ratted on by two of his not-so-loyal mates); ironically, just prior to his arrest he had secretly taken the jewels and rehidden them.  So the film revolves around the attempts of the others to discover the location of the jewels.
The plot is indeed a good one, but what really makes this film exceptional and so hilarious is the colourful cast of characters and the splendid performances of all involved.  There simply isn't one weak performance here.
The central character is a beautiful and spirited American woman named Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), the lone female in the gang and the only intelligent one of the lot.  Wanda's one weakness, however, is her penchant for hearing foreign languages--it's something that really turns her on!  This makes for much hilarity between her and her fellow gangster, Otto (whom Wanda has been trying to pass off as her brother), as Otto rattles off every known Italian food dish, type of cheese, and so on, in his attempts to seduce Wanda.  Otto (Kevin Kline), by the way, is a highly paranoid, Nietzsche-reading yet empty-headed, Anglophobic, trigger-happy lunatic who thinks he's an intellectual and enjoys sniffing his armpits.  He's a flamboyant personality to say the least, and one which Kline manages to carry off wonderfully--I simply cannot imagine anyone doing a better job.  These two are the real powerhouses of the gang.
Then there's poor Ken (Michael Palin (Monty Python)), who's an avid animal lover--a fact which provides the basis for some extremely funny scenes.  He's a humorously pathetic character--a little bit on the simple side with the worst stammer ever, and if  there's a show-stealer (and I say ""if"" for they're all so good), for me it's Ken.  He's simply hilarious, and the interplay between him and the nasty Otto is simply priceless.  (It's a bit like watching a cat relentlessly toying with a poor, helpless little mouse).  Lastly, one mustn't forget John Cleese, who portrays Archie, the rather reserved barrister representing George, the incarcerated gang member, and who, I just have to add, has Wanda in a fit of ecstasy (unbeknownst to himself) in one hilarious scene when he starts spouting Russian.
In conclusion, the film (which has a running time of 108 minutes) is definitely a must-see for fans of British comedy or, for that matter, for anyone looking for a thoroughly entertaining not to mention hilarious film.  I've seen it a number of times and certainly don't regret purchasing it.  It's definitely one to watch and rewatch.  And if you've enjoyed the film, by all means check out Fawlty Towers (also co-written by and starring John Cleese and also featuring an abundance of visual humour).  You'll not regret it--it's simply one of the funniest shows ever made.  And so is this film!

John Cleese in fact sought out Chrichton in hopes of a collaboration for A Fish Called Wanda.  Starting out with only a rudimentary idea of the story, and Chrichton's request that he wanted ""...to see someone steamrolled"", the final result was a film that somehow struck a humorous chord all over the world.  The film just somehow ""worked"", and it's been a cherished classic ever sense.
Kevin Kline as the violent, idiotic, and egotistic Otto indirectly steals the film, but it is John Cleese who is the genius behind the scenes.

985136,4,6305161879,"Starting with the commonplace idea of a jewel robbery gone maniacally wrong, actor John Cleese and director Charles Crichton manage have created a madcap comedy that remains fresh, even after 10 years.  George (Tom Georgeson), assisted by his girlfriend Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), his best pal Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's 'brother' Otto (Kevin Kline) has orchestrated a robbery that has only one fatal flaw - none of the participants have any intention of sharing the loot.  In short order, double-crosses seem to grow on trees and George finds himself under arrest.  It is only fitting that Wanda and Otto simultaneously discover that the jewels have been moved 'for safekeeping.'
It doesn't take very long for Wanda to figure out that her only hope of regaining the loot is through George's barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese).  Wanda works at seducing Leach while fighting of Otto's psychotic fits of jealousy.  Ken, in the meantime, attempts repeatedly to kill the only witness, an elderly woman.  Unfortunately, he manages to assassinate all three of her dogs in the process.
This is a set up for the combination of slapstick, vulgarity, and tongue-in-cheek comedy that British films are noted for and Americans love and it is delivered with an almost evil verve.  Cleese is determined to take no prisoners, and the landscape is littered with car crashes, fallen masonry, savaged canines (fake savaged canines, please) and hapless victims.  Only the fish (also called Wanda) has no funny lines, and fares no better than her companion 'Lunch' does.
The film has an R rating, which I think is exaggerated.  In reality, its vulgarity and sexual innuendo are hardly noticeable when compared to what is accepted today.  I certainly think teenagers can handle it without permanent damage, although you may have to explain to them that certain phrases don't bear repeating.  At this price, expect a bare bones DVD.  No added games, no interviews, just the film in French and English, in both wide screen and standard presentations.

985141,5,6305161879,"What makes this special is the interplay between American and English attitudes that is at its heart. This is a pet area of co-writer and star Cleese who has had three American wives and nurtures a fascination for the differences between the two cultures. This can be seen both in his work with Monty Python and in the Fawlty Towers episode The Americans. The conflict created between the characters' backgrounds creates much of the magic and gives the picture its transatlantic appeal. Cleese gives a career best performance as an actor, being surprisingly vulnerable in the love scenes and making us believe that he has fallen in love with Jamie Lee Curtis. Kline won an deserved Oscar for his very very funny supporting role, but all four stars contribute equally to this post-modern Ealing comedy. This leads me to mention director Charles Crichton. In his last feature film, Crichton was in his late seventies when this was made. Having directed classic Ealing comedies The Titfield Thunderbolt and The Lavender Hill Mob, Crichton had retired from feature films in the 1960s and since then had turned in many well received episodes of television series such as The Avengers and The Professionals. His return to feature films marked a return to the form which had made him so successful in his Ealing days, garnering him commercial success and his only Oscar nomination.",1008547200,,1374,4.978260869565218

Yet somehow, every single one of them made me snigger, laugh, and once even gasp for breath from laughing so hard. John Cleese plays a barrister (He's well suited for the role) who is defending the boss of three jewel thieves, played very well by Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin. The boss is being arrested on charges of animal cruelty, of all things. The title comes from the name of Palin's character's favorite goldfish, Wanda.

985205,5,6305161879,"A Fish Called Wanda may be crude, but it is really a romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense of the word. It contains all the neccesary romance elements: an unlikely couple (Cleese and Curtis); a love triangle (in this case a love hexagon); and just about the right amount of sentiment sprinkled in, But it also posseses a wicked sense of humour the perfectly balances and compliments the romance. In a way, something to please everyone.
 The old fashioned whimsy of the tale combined with a sense of the macabre is heightened by the presence of Charles Chichton, one time director of many of the similarily dark Ealing comedies who masterly handles this story of a jewell robbery aftermath, with all it's backstabbing and bed hopping. In fact, Wanda could very much be considered an eighties desendent of Ealing.
 The cast is sublime. Cleese gives his usual but still enigmatic stuffy British suit performance as barrister Archie Leach, brilliant in the early scenes where he is stuck in his stale upper class marriage with an uncaring wife and a spoilt daughter. As Leach, defending gangster George (Tom Georgeson) on robbery charges begins an affair with chief defence witness and George's girlfriend Wanda (A gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis).
 Kevin Kline performs a comedy masterclass as the ignorant, philosophy reading, violent tempered Otto, Wanda's ""brother"", and he seems to have a problem with any men that show his ""sister"" too much attention.
 But Kline is just pipped to show stealing honours by Michael Palin, as the stuttering, animal loving getaway driver Ken. He's George's best mate, and also fancies Wanda, but thinks Otto is gay... oh, and he has a fish that's also called Wanda, which Otto doesn't like. Confused? You won't be, as this near note-perfect comedy fits together piece by piece as all and sundry double cross each other, before reaching a happy climax.

John Cleese is excellent as the typical English lawyer, who is dying to break out of harness of Englishness, Jamie Lee Curtis is the most sexy gangster girl ever and Kevin Kline is the most cliche American hitman you can imagine. There are numberous brilliant and classic scenes, varying from John Cleese who is being disturbed while stripping and spreaking Russianby the new owners of a house he has hired from a friend to Jamie Lee Curtis explaining to the ultra-stupid Kevin Kline that the London Underground is NOT a political movement. And you also learn how to torture a person using only French fries and a pear. So watch it, enjoy it and laugh yourself to pieces.",998956800,,761,4.602941176470588

985208,3,6305161879,"Given that ""Wanda"" is way up there in my personal ""Top 25"" list, I eagerly anticipated its release on DVD and picked it up as soon as the opportunity presented itself.
Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed in the DVD version.  Were there no deleted scenes or outtakes that could've been added?  Was there no behind-the-scenes documentary footage to show us?  Could Michael Palin and/or John Cleese not be persuaded to add any commentary to one of the audio tracks?  And speaking of the audio - why on Earth is the soundtrack in MONO??!?  When I saw that on the box, I thought that _had_ to be a misprint - but no, the soundtrack is indeed in bloody single-channel monophonic.

We finally rented it and, about a half hour into it, I  turned to her and asked, ""When does it get funny?""  Seriously.  I  saw nothing funny about the whole beginning of the movie.  About an hour  into it, we finally get to a scene that made me laugh.  There were a few  others after that, but not many.
Not only wasn't the movie funny, it  wasn't very well done, either.  The movie starts with these people planning  a burglary.  Then the burglary occurs and the so-called hijinks begin.  Who  are these people?  Why are they robbing this bank?  We get no background on  these characters, how they met, or what their relationships are to each  other.  That might have helped.
Finally, what's up with the title?  What  does robbing a bank have to do with the fact that one of the guys has a  fish with the same name as Jamie Lee Curtis' character?  I don't get  it.

Kevin Kline pulled off one of the greatest movie performances of  all-time. He definately deserved his Oscar award for his role as  ""Don't Call Me Stupid"" Otto.
John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis  & Michael Palin were magnificent.
Even animal lovers will laugh  hysterically at Palin's attempts to ""rub out"" Cleese's  witness!

985284,5,6305161879,"Excellent comedies that really work are so very few and far between, but this beauty ranks among the best ever!  Never before has John Cleese thrown so much humanity into a character; when he's smitten with Jamie Lee Curtis'  character, he is absolutely head over heels in love, and it shows, and even  more, it's believable!  His character goes through and exhibits the full  range of human emotions, and Cleese pulls it off masterfully.  Kevin Kline  is at the top of his game in this one--never again will I ever call anyone  ""stupid,"" lest they react like Kline's character does!  Really  one of this country's most under-rated actors (despite the Best Supporting  Actor Oscar for this movie).  And not to be left out, Jamie Lee Curtis and  Michael Palin are SO perfect for their roles--what a riot!  Palin's  character in particular is a real study in bodily disintegration!  No  offense to dog lovers, but Palin's reaction to his attempts at knocking-off  the elderly witness that actually results in the reduction of her band of  pets is comedy at it's finest!  Hilarious and touching all at the same  time, Wanda is a rare gem among recent movies; excellent cast, great  characters, hilarious story line, and dead-on dialogue.  You'll be  snickering long after it's over.  And never again will you look at  fishtanks, fish and chips, or old ladies out walking their little dogs, the  same!

I love this movie  because the plot twists and turns; you never know who's going to end up  with Wanda or the fortune until the very, very end. It's so well acted,  too. Kevin Kline deserved the Oscar he won for it!  You'd never guess Palin  didn't have a stutter in real life, he acts so well.

985372,4,6305161879,"I love the movie ""A Fish Called Wanda"".  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  If you haven't seen it, go rent/buy it - there is no better time to see it, now that it is on DVD!
Therefore, this is a review  of the DVD - not the movie.  The DVD has a very good presentation of the  movie - the best you can watch at home (as mentioned above).  However, the  sound is lacking - dull mono.  Maybe this movie was originally recorded in  mono, but I would be surprised.
Next there is the lack of extras - you  get the trailer and ""cast notes"" but virtually nothing else...  just a dumb fish screen saver.
I don't mean to be so down on this DVD, it  isn't terrible, it is just a disappointment to think of all of the  unrealized potential.  First of all, there is the sound.  Then, there was  no behind the scenes featurette, no comentaries, no deleted scenes,  nothing.  With Kline, Cleese, Palin and Curtis in the cast, there could  have been all kinds of killer extras.  But there wasn't...
At this point  I would give this DVD 3 stars.  However, it earns an extra star because MGM  bowed to pressure and put it out in Widescreen.  They originally planned on  P&S only.
So thanks a lot, MGM, but now get busy on a  ""Collectors Edition"".
