880340,3,6304411375,"Not much happening in this psuedo, comedy western from 1970. How Frank got talked into this farce would make good coversation over a drink or two.  If he was trying to follow up for SERGEANTS THREE, or 4 FOR TEXAS, he missed the bullseye.

However, if you have free time of a few hours to spare, and if like me have never seen this film before, then you might want to watch it.  I remember when they were filming it from some outtakes shown back then, but had never seen this one in theatres or on cable.  Thanks to Encore Westerns I have finally been able to view the film, albeit 38 years later with most actors in the film now dead and buried.

I read many westerns and enjoy western movies so I don't find this movie as objectionable as some may.  I also enjoy the work of many of the actors in the film, so overall I give it a medium rating of 3 stars.  At certain points in the film I did laugh aloud, and while it will never become my favorite film, it is worth viewing.  Certainly Frank left us with some much better films, but I'll bet ole blue eyes had a 'gas' making this 'ring a ding, ding', one.

880341,3,6304411375,"This movie was made as a comedic sexual comedy at a time when such things were really pretty tame by todays standards.  The script is mediocre but the cast is great.

The Chairman of the Board demonstrates adeptness at broad comedy which is genuinely surprising showing a side of himself that I've never seen before.

880764,3,6304411375,"Frank Sinatra as Dingus Magee, George Kennedy as Hoke Birdsill, Anne Jackson as Belle Nops, Lois Nettleton as Prudence Frost, Jack Elam as Wesley Hardin (spoofing real-life outlaw John Wesley Hardin), Michele Carey as Anna Hot Water, John Dehner as General George, Henry Jones as Reverend Green, Harry Carey, Jr. as Charles Stuart, Paul Fix as Chief Crazy Blanket, and Terry Wilson as the unnamed Sergeant.
This is meant to be a comedy farce and yet offers better than expected costuming, sets, cast, & continuity of theme.  On the other hand, had Jerry Lewis of 1966 to 2010 MDA telethon notoriety been the title star, this movie wouldn't have been worth a pinch of spit.  Not bashing Jerry Lewis necessarily, just pointing out that Frank Sinatra was a better fit.  Tim Conway wouldnt have been as good as Frank Sinatra, and I am a huge fan of Tim Conways character acting and humor.  Similarly, Don Knots wouldnt have been right for this film either.
That said, I also admit that Frank Sinatra didn't put much effort into this film, letting the supporting cast carry the film instead, as if he were deliberately holding back.
The film is loosely based upon a book, negatively mocks the military, comically idealizes whores and a whore house, and the best part of this movie is the American Indian maiden named Anna Hot Water.  This isn't meant for easily offended die-hard fans of serious westerns.  It is a slapstick spoof of ridiculously absurd situations meant to be viewed without engaging much of your intelligence, in fact the less intelligence you use, the more you will be able to relax and just laugh.  It also helps to keep in mind this is a 1970 film.  There isn't any reason for this movie to be rated R, however, parts of it may not be appropriate in a strict Christian home with impressionable children (are there any of those really?).
Not quite up to par with Support Your Local Gunfighter (James Garner) or Trinity Is Still My Name (Bud Spencer / Terence Hill), or Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks), or  F-Troop (Forest Tucker / Larry Storch / Ken Berry), or some of the spaghetti western comedies of forty years ago.

Someone who had never read the book might get a few chuckles out of the movie, but it was dull, plodding, and hideously miscast.  Really, it doesn't even deserve a one-star rating.

7871661,4,6304411375,"Review of Dirty Dingus Magee
Hot Toasty Rag, September 13, 2017

If you liked Frank Sinatras Tony Rome, youll like Dirty Dingus Magee. Its a ridiculous, silly sex comedy with an abundance of gags about sex and cleavage, like many 1960s comedies. In the 60s, the restrictive Hays Code was lifted, so films were able to make jokes like that, and show a moderate amount of nudity. So, when you look at it from that perspective, of course Hollywood would go a little nuts making T & A jokes!

Dirty Dingus Magee is the name of Frank Sinatras character; hes a womanizing thief who talks his way out of many sticky situations. The film starts as George Kennedy reunites with Frank; hes not happy to see him, and we soon find out why. Frankie talks and talks, and before we know it, hes robbed George of his nest egg and his favorite hat! The rest of the movie is a tug-of-war between George and Frankie, trying to rob, fight, arrest, and get ahead of the other. Its set in the Wild West, so there are cowboys, Indians, stagecoaches, and babes in brothels galore!

As silly as it isand it is really sillyI actually thought this movie was very funny. George and Frankie have great chemistry together, and both their comedic timings are excellent. Its fast paced and doesnt milk the same joke over and over. Once a gags been done, Joseph Heller and Tom and Frank Waldman write a new one, equally light-hearted and funny. If youve had a hard week, rent Dirty Dingus Magee and take a load offjust hold on to your hat!",1505260800,,1506,4.469090909090909
