427779,5,6302098491,"This movie is simply wonderful. It is hard to believe that a movie that was made in 1938 would be in color. But it is, and the acting is great.  It is a good old-fashioned story and movie.  Great for the whole family!!!",1041206400,13,219,4.069767441860465
427780,5,6302098491,"Young Tom Sawyer is a troublemaking boy being raised by his Aunt Polly in pre-Civil War America. His best friend is a wandering outcast of a boy named Huck Finn. Tom is a bit of a ladies' man, and his newest pursuit is the new Judge's daughter, Becky Thatcher. Through the course of the story we see his adventures with Huck, his troubles with Becky, and his encounters with a villain by the name of Injun' Joe. See, Tom and Huck witnessed Injun' Joe commit murder, so Joe is determined to shut them up permanently. Tom has to decide whether or not to break his oath with Huck and testify against Joe to save the wrongly accused Muff Potter(the friendly neighborhood drunk)'s life!
  I picked this up on VHS a while back for around 5 bucks or so at my local retailer. I snatched it up because I LOVE Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn movies! For my money, the most enjoyable is Disney's Elijah Wood Film, from the early '90's I believe, called The Adventures of Huck Finn, though it doesn't have Tom at all. It's actually one of my all time favorite movies! Though, for a wonderful and more true to the book Huck movie you should go with the Patrick Day version. As for Tom Sawyer, this is the best version I've seen so far (and I have yet to see a good animated version of any of these stories, though I seem to recall seing a good Anime as a kid about Huck on Nickelodeon, years ago). This version is just so charming thanks to the time period in which it was made! It was odd that Jim was just a kid in it, but it doesn't prevent this film from being a masterpiece! I wouldn't have liked that in a Huck movie, but for Tom it was not a problem. The entire cast plays perfectly. Since I bought this movie a year or so ago, I've enjoyed it many times and hope it gets a DVD release someday. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Tom/Huck movies for the same reason as I do, not necessarily for their loyalty to the book, but more for the adventure and mostly carefree fun these stories portray!",1020816000,31,1983,4.257294429708223
427781,4,6302098491,"Mark Twain's immortal story of a boy in a Mississippi River town in the 1840's must, by now, be familiar to most every American. Those who know and admire the book will be pleasantly surprised with this mostly-forgotton (and unjustifiably so) Technicolor gem from 1938. In its day, this version had all that money could buy (most notably Technicolor!) The previously unknown child actors amazingly look just like Tom and Becky should look; it just misses greatness (Tommy Kelly was no Freddie Bartholomew) but its still a film filled with endearing, nostalgic scenes, faithfully reproduced.......... After whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence, Tom and Huck visit the cemetery on a strange, nocturnal errand. Huck has a dead cat in a bag and a theory that by heaving it after the devils who carry off the corpse of a newly buried sinner, a boy can get rid of worts. In the cemetery, Tom and Huck witness a murder by Indian Joe; they sign in blood an agreement never to tell. Tom and Becky go exploring and get lost in a limestone cave, then there's the sequence where the pirates return to their own funeral..........Incredibly, more than 25,000 kids were interviewed in the search for suitable child actors to fit the roles of Tom and Becky. Tommy Kelly was found by one of Selznick's talent scouts in the sixth grade of a Parochial school in the Bronx; Ann Gillis hailed from Little Rock, Arkansas.",1005264000,15,1394,4.8125
427782,5,6302098491,"Produced by Selznick, this is one of the truest versions of  Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.  Though liberties were taken with the character of Jim, the richness (done in color) and the acting are superb.  From painting the fence to Becky Thatcher's hero to attending their own funeral to Injun Joe and the harrowing cave scene, this version still brings tears to the eye and a smile to the heart.  The actress playing Aunt Polly hid her age from Selznick because she was afraid if he knew she was in her 80's, she wouldn't win the coveted role.  Great for Kids of all ages, it's a wonderful introduction to Tom Sawyer and the world of Mark Twain's books.  Rent, buy, and borrow.  Watch it with your favorite child at heart.",995500800,21,717,4.511627906976744
427783,5,6302098491,"While David O. Selznick was making ""Gone With The Wind"", his studio was creating this wonderful adaptation of Mark Twain's unforgettable book.  Included in the film is a wonderful Max Steiner score that is  reminiscent of his work on GWTW.  I've shown this version in my juvenile  hall classroom many times over the years and it never fails with this  hardcore audience.",940464000,11,370,4.903225806451613
427784,4,6302098491,"The book and this movie became the staple of my childhood,  Growing up less than 50 miles from where all this took place, I was enthralled with the museums, the cave and the other houses in Hannibal..This movie truly  captured the romantic boyhood of Tom Sawyer (Sam Clemens).  It is hard  sometimes to know where the book stops and the movie takes over.  Other  Hollywood adaptations of this story have turned out silly, but this one  will always hold up well.  Buy it, watch it, treasure it, and go back to it  again and again!",918691200,7,529,4.484210526315789

427909,5,6302098491,"I've loved this movie since I was a child (and now I'm an old man with children old enough to start being grandparents). I previously owned a VHS tape of it but transferred it to DVD because video tape wears out eventually. I don't know if the manufacturers of this DVD attempted to restore the movie or just did what I did and transferred t from video tape to DVD. But at least I have a DVD of the best version of Tom Sawyer that has ever been filmed, and that's a lot. My primary gripe about this DVD is that, except for the title, all the rest of the cover is in Korean. I found it very offputting and unfriendly. You'd think they could have spent a few extra cents and provided a cover that American consumers could read. It just comes across as cheap. That aside, this is still the 1936 version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and it doesn't get any better than this.",1479254400,2,872,4.196428571428571

428081,4,6302098491,"Arrived quick!  My kids loved the movie, but the sound was off slightly.  Speaking on the movie was in English, but writing on packaging was in Chinese.  That's okay, but speaking on the movie was slightly off from mouth movement of the characters so maybe it had previously been in another language and English was dubbed over.  Don't know the correct terminology, but I'm sure you get what I'm saying.  It was indeed the 1938 version I was looking for and family loved the movie.",1435881600,,481,4.6117647058823525

428131,5,6302098491,"In spite the fact that this is not a restored film, I still enjoy this old movie classic. And the picture is clear enough to be enjoyed. I had seen it several times as a kid, and now as an adult I still find it enjoyable. The memorable whitewashing scene, Sid's ridiculous behavior, falling in love with Becky Thatcher, his dear aunt, witnessing a crime along with Huck Finn, the trial over this crime, and his final encounter with Indian Joe are all included. The scene where Tom Sawyer coming out of the cave is unforgettable. The Mark Twain feeling of the story is left intact here albeit its minor alterations for the purpose of the film. I wonder why any American company hasn't bout the rights for this film, a United Artists release back then, for the purpose of selling and distributing it.",1418428800,6,798,4.548611111111111

After watching about 10-12 minutes of the film, I stopped the DVD player, extracted the disc, and threw it away.  The images and sound are simply a horrible abomination.  Especially when you consider the great story, the terrific cast (and what should be) some of the most spectacular early Technicolor images of their day - and beyond.

I presume somewhere out there, is a respectable copy of, or the original nitrate print I was fortunate-enough to view many years ago.  What a treat that would be to see that again.  This ""copy"" is worthy of nothing more than a drink coaster or trivet.",1387152000,2,762,4.641791044776119

428222,1,6302098491,"Although we can all agree the film, itself, is a wonderful version of the famous story - the print quality is far from acceptable.  For those of us lucky-enough to have viewed an original Technicolor print of the film, this one pales by comparison.  While it may be ""acceptable"" in that the print is complete and the sound is as good as any from 1938, the original muted, Technicolor colors are nowhere to be found in the atrocious color palette that's standing-in for the original.  This print will merely continue the rumor that the film was colorized, rather than serve as an example of what beautiful Technicolor can be.  Additionally, the print is far too grainy, more resembling a 16mm print - and a poor quality one, at that.

If it's the story and acting you're after, this version will serve that purpose just fine.  But if you were hoping for capturing the wonderful production values, you'll have to provide those yourself, as the distributors of this DVD were merely looking for a quick buck.",1382313600,,1004,4.708571428571428

I started the movie when my great-nieces, ages 5 & 7, were over & they had to take it home in order to finish viewing; they were fascinated & properly frightened.

Hollywood, especially during it's Golden Age, was notorious for editing classic literature, ""improving"" it for film editions; happily, this film is a pretty faithful rendition of the original book. (That is, for me, a vital detail.) It includes many familiar and popular scenes from the novel, such as the white-washing of the fence, Tom and Huck's attendance at their own funeral, the murder trial of Tom's friend, the drunkard Muff Potter, and the climactic chase of Tom and Becky Thatcher through the caves by Injun Joe. The script, by John V. A. Weaver, is witty, adventurous, nostalgic, and in parts, quite chilling. It does a very good job in capturing the elemental spirit of Twain's book. The cast, mostly unknown to today's audiences, is wonderful. Tommy Kelly is surprisingly good and effective as Tom, as are Jackie Moran as Huckleberry Finn and Ann Gillis as Becky Thatcher. But I must give special kudos to personal favorites May Robson as Aunt Polly, Spring Byington as the Widow Douglas, and Walter Brennan as Muff Potter. Also, Victor Jory, in the small role of Injun Joe, is appropriately menacing. It is also visually very pretty to look at - early movie eye candy.",1347148800,2,1321,4.875555555555556

But I suspect that it will never happen. So I decided to buy this available Korean copy, risking receiving an inferior print of the film that I've cherished over the years. Don't be mistaken into believing that this film was ever colorized after the fact. It was released in sparkling color. The error arises from watching a thoroughly degraded, washed out copy that has never received the necessary repair work that other lesser-quality movies have experienced. I wish that UCLA or some other technical professionals could get a copy of the original nitrate negative to give this film the critical and painstakingly careful makeover that it truly deserves. But I suspect that my hope will never come to pass.

The Korean DVD is watchable but the sound isn't synchronized to film. The lips are moving ever-so slightly after the words have been spoken. That can be annoying. And the print, like I said, needs a serious overhaul. But if you are a fan like me, you'll tolerate the major defects to enjoy this childhood fantasy. The technical expertise to repair this film exists. Just watch ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz,"" or ""Casablanca.""

To ensure that I received the proper DVD, I bought directly from Amazon, not their marketplace, in the remote event that some of the dealers sold different copies (this is pure speculation only on my part, and no blame is directed toward any individual seller).

The mischief of Tom and Huck is captured better in this version than most (with the exception of the Canadian series a few years afterward that i remember fondly)

  You know the story of Tom Sawyer likely as not. A young lad who has his first crush (on Becky Thatcher), stops a serious villian (Injun Joe), and manages to get into mischief (Jane Wyatt of all people gives him a good spanking in this version). Anyone who likes childhood adventures will like the story. And anyone who grew up in a small town can still relate to some of the scrapes our hero gets into and out of. I can at least. I've always liked Tom Sawyer as my favourite of Mark Twain's books.

428403,5,6302098491,"There have been countless versions of this classic over the years, but none of them can compare to the 1938 original.  The way I see it, Tommy Kelly IS Tom Sawyer, and always will be!  He really spoiled the role for all that would follow.  He's absolutely brilliant!

I'll admit the movie can be a bit campy at times, but charmingly and unapologetically so.  Tom's fencewalk, in trying to impress Becky Thatcher, is hokey and predictable, but at the same time, it is so poetic.  I'll never tire of Sid's sappy, pathetic whining cry of ""Aunt Polly!!!"" throughout the film, and the slap he receives is the most memorable and satisfying moment of the entire movie.

There are also a few puzzling changes from the original story, but they're minor, and don't really detract from the telling of Twain's tale.  It's a mostly faithful representation of Twain's wit, satire, charm, and humor.  It definitely does the book justice.

428438,5,6302098491,"""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" was made in 1938 by that legendary
showman David O. Selznick who once said ""There are two types of
class - first class and no class"". Well, this movie is first class
all the way. If you are looking around for the best movie version
of a Mark Twain story, then look no further because this is it. The
classic Mark Twain story now becomes a classic motion picture and
it has never been done better.

The production values and the casting are excellent. Filming
originally commenced in black and white but this was scrapped when
a color unit became available at the last minute and the entire
movie was then filmed in technicolor.

The impeccable cast includes:
  Tommy Kelly as Tom Sawyer
  Jackie Moran as Huckleberry Finn
  May Robson as Aunt Polly
  Walter Brennan as Muff Potter
  Victor Jory as Injun Joe
  David Holt as Sid Sawyer
  Ann Gillis as Becky Thatcher

Tommy Kelly's portrayal of the main character is perfect and
everything you could wish to expect. He is the definitive Tom
Sawyer.

I do not wish to elaborate on the story which most people already
know as it has been told many times over the years in various
movie adaptions. All I wish to say is that it is a sentimental
tale of boyhood in 1850 Missouri.

The picture quality of this disc is excellent and the Dolby
Digital 5.1 sound is very impressive.

428442,5,6302098491,"This is my favorite Tom Sawyer adaptation. I watched it on Youtube a few months ago. You might want to check out the film on Youtube before you purchase [see commments section for URL].

Seriously, this film should be released in the U.S. region 1 media market because it is very interested and accurate to Mark Twain's novel by the same time. For example, that adaptation is far MORE accurate than Disney's ""Tom and Huck.""

I would like to emphasize that the film is not perfect - it still leaves out a few good scenes. Yet, it does keep a large number of the important scenes, especially those humorous ones between Tom Sawyer (Tommy Kelly) and Sid (David Holt).

Additionally, Injun Joe is not Disney-fied into an idiot as he is in ""Tom and Huck."" This Injun Joe (Victor Jory) is pretty similar to the characterization by Twain.

BOTTOM LINE:

I highly recommend this film. However, you may also want to check out the 1979 miniseries ""Huckleberry Finn and His Friends,"" which is the best rendition of any Twain's novel ""Tom Sawyer.""

While I am grateful for this Korean DVD, the picture quality is actualy a little less stellar than previously reviewed by other customers.  I found the picture quality not only a terribly faded technicolor, but extremely grainy as well, as if mastered from a 16mm television print.  As reported, the sound was not a terrible distracton, but did contain a consistant hiss which reveals that it is not ben remastered from restored materials or even from the most recent VHS or laserdisc releases.  Still, objections aside, an imperfect DVD is better than no DVD at all.  I will at least have this version until a restored version is released by the rightful copyright owners.

In the past 15-20 years, the rights to this film have passed from one distributor to another, yet no official DVD to date has been released.  MGM, whose DVDs are now manufactured and released by 20th Century Fox Home Video, may hold the rights to this Selznick gem along with most of the other Selznick titles in MGM's coiffers.

Tommy Kelly plays Tom in this David O. Selznik Technicolor classic. A mischievious boy at heart, he causes commotion in the town when he runs away to play pirates, and returns to find that he has been assumed dead. When he reveals himself, he does not stay out of trouble for very long. He and Huckleberry Finn (Jackie Moran) become involved in a murder trial. After that, Tom and girlfriend Becky Thatcher (Ann Gillis) find themselves lost in the caves nearby.

The child stars are surprisingly unimpressive. Their antics seem natural enough, but Kelly nor Gillis have enough charm or spunk to cement themselves in the memory. The film is also uneven; the most exciting parts are the scenes in the caves, but everything before is mediocre.

428505,5,6302098491,"There have been numerous film adaptations of Mark Twain's beloved story, ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" but few capture the boyish wonder and childlike bliss which permeates the classic yarn. Luckily, this 1938 rendition is one of the select few that do. The acting is first class; the directing often innovative, and the whimsical screenplay is faithful as possible to the novel.
The novel itself is entertainingly superior to Huckleberry Finn in its lack of a political agenda or societal commentary. Its sole objective is to return us once more to the naivety of youth when our life was far simpler and, in many cases, far happier.
For the older generation of film aficionados, child actor Tommy Kelly was the definitive Tom Sawyer. His winning smile, visible freckles and bright eyes encapsulate the literary character to a tee. After watching this film and re-reading Twain's novel, it is impossible to remove the image of Tommy Kelly from one's mind as he or she remembers Sawyer's antics.
It is in the supporting characters, however, that this film truly shines. The grade-A performances of Walter Brennan as the likeable Muff Potter, a make-up smeared Victory Jory as the menacing Injun Joe and Olin Howlin as the violent schoolmaster are highlights of the film. Brennan seems to infuse a perpetual helplessness in his inebriated character that epitomizes the small town bum of a forgotten America; Jory makes Injun Joe the personification of evil and a red-faced Howlin is superlative as an authoritarian teacher who makes the audience cringe when he canes Tom. Australian-native May Robeson, who portrays Aunt Polly, is able to make smooth, believable transitions from harsh severity to tender leniency as the script demands.
Remarkably, the numerous child stars in this film were destined for unhappy lives. David Holt (Sid) spent his early life as a child actor in poverty as he, much like Tommy Kelly, waited for star-making film roles which never came. Jackie Moran (Huckleberry Finn) soared briefly higher towards elusive stardom when he was cast as the energetic sidekick of Buster Crabbe in a ""Buck Rogers"" (1939) serial. Immediately afterwards, Moran's career plummeted into oblivion. Perhaps the only exception to this streak of bad luck was Ann Gillis (Becky Thatcher) who found herself always in demand to portray a screen brat. Upon coming of age and legally capable of making her own decisions, Gillis wisely left the film industry to find happiness elsewhere.
""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" (1938) is also significant in that its talented screenwriter, John V.A. Weaver, died shortly after its release of tuberculosis. His successful but altogether short career included writing screenplays for such cinematic classics as King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" (1928) and ""The Saturday Night Kid"" (1929). In a sense, this film was his last hurrah and it is only fitting that Weaver's last project in his old age should be subtly based upon the universal human longing to be young once again.
Film Rating: *** out of **** stars.
A must-view for all devout Twainians!",1071360000,32,3076,5.117296222664016
