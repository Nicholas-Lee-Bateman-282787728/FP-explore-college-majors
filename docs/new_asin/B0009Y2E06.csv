8070270,5,B0009Y2E06,"Journey Together is a film made with a lot of the acting talent that was still in the Royal Air Force in 1945. In that respect it was like the David Niven film The Way Ahead which was done while Niven and the rest of the male members of that cast were still in the service. In this case Richard Attenborough who had made a big impression in a small role in In Which We Serve got to star in this film about a young enlistee in the RAF who wants to be a pilot.

From the days of Eddie Rickenbacker to the days of Tom Cruise in Top Gun the glamor spot in the Air service of any country is being a pilot. You get the commission, the rank, and the best of the female groupies around. Attenborough's no different, but he does not make it as a pilot.

However while training in Arizona he gets to work with instructor Edward G. Robinson who washes him out as a pilot, but says he can make it as a navigator. As Robinson puts it the pilot is just glamorized driver, he was the whole show in those single engine biplanes from World War I, but in this war he's just the head of crew and they all have jobs to do.

Particularly the navigator and Robinson and I agree it takes brains to be a navigator, to read those charts and instruments and plot a right course. He fails, everybody fails.

Attenborough gets a chance in combat to show how important navigators are and what he does is what you see Journey Together for.

The presence of Edward G. Robinson albeit in a small role insured a few more dollars for the American market. But the film is Attenborough's and he does a fine job in the lead. Journey Together is a nicely plotted war film and aviation buffs will love seeing those vintage British airplanes.",1524700800,,1702,4.208588957055214

8070278,3,B0009Y2E06,"""Journey Together"" is a short B&W  WWII-era propaganda film of the type made to show the folks back home the nature and difficulty of the war effort and buoy their spirits during the ongoing struggle. It stars well-known British actor Richard Attenborough as a young pilot in training and Edward G. Robinson as the crusty American instructor trying to whip into shape another batch of fledgling pilots aiming to take their places at the helm of the greatest war engine of the day, the B-17. The movie details the ups and downs of these brave lads, centering around the exploits of young David Wilton, played by Attenborough, who, despite an inability to master landing an airplane, finally earns his wings.

I'm a fan of old movies in general, and old war movies in particular. But the real reason I bought this, after years of searching, is that my Dad is in it. During WWII, he worked on a ""crash line"" at Shepherd Field Air Force Base in England, where much of this was filmed. His job, with the other members of his ambulance crew, was to meet incoming B-17s as they returned from one of their endless bombing runs over Nazi-held territory on the Continent.  First responders, they retrieved the dead and wounded from the bullet-riddled hulks, and then rushed the survivors back to the surgical wards. He proudly told us about this movie and even owned a few still photos showing the stars. Indeed, about a half-hour into it, there's a scene where Attenborough crash-lands his trainer, and the ambulance (and everybody else) rushes out to retrieve him. Sure enough, there's my Dad standing right behind Edward G. Robinson as he admonishes the young pilot for a job not quite well done.",1357344000,17,1689,4.757679180887372
8070279,5,B0009Y2E06,"Despite its vague, easily forgettable title, Journey Together is yet another fantastic war film to have come out of wartime Britain.  It is principally a tribute to the Royal Air Force.  Not only is it produced by the RAF film unit, many of the cast members actually served in the RAF at the time.  A notable exception is Edward G. Robinson, who is really just superb as an American flight instructor who takes charge of the film's main characters during part of their pilot training.  If you've ever wondered how a guy got to serve aboard a bomber in World War II, this is your movie because it takes you through the whole training program and, in the end, into combat over the skies of Berlin.

The story follows three young servicemen as they work their way through the training program of flight school and beyond.  I lost track of the third character along the way, though, because the focus is almost completely on young David Wilton (Richard Attenborough) and John Aynesworth (Jack Watling).  Wilton has a young Mickey Rooney quality to him - he's boyish and excitable, and when he gets down on himself, he really goes all out.  All he wants to be is a pilot, but he's lucky to get in to flight school at all.  Aynesworth, meanwhile, is a natural-born pilot.  Wilton knows his stuff, while Aynesworth doesn't learn all that much and even tries to cheat on his exams - I would have thought the RAF frowned on that kind of thing, but we all know they needed good pilots during World War II.  The two buddies eventually make it out to Arizona to train and earn their wings (under the tutelage of an American instructor played by Edward G. Robinson).  These RAF men enjoy a surprisingly personal relationship with all of their instructors up and down the line, I must say, as learning seems to be stressed over discipline.  In any event, Wilton hits a brick wall in his training - he's an excellent flier, but he can't land a plane worth a diddlysquat.  Landing's sort of an important part of the whole flying equation, and Wilton eventually finds himself transferred to navigation school.

Wilton wants to be a pilot, not a navigator, and he basically mopes around and doesn't pay strict attention to his studies.  If his superior officers didn't go to great pains to change his outlook on life, this guy would have been booted out completely or gotten some fellow crewmen killed.  Personally, with Aynesworth's cheating and Wilton's lack of commitment to navigation, I would have given both of them the boot.  Navigation is incredibly important; if you're flying a bombing run deep into Germany, you sort of want to avoid the trouble spots, find and hit your target, and get home safely - which is something Wilton learns first-hand when he finally goes out on his first combat mission.

With all of this training and a distinct lack of females, this film might sound a little boring.  It's not.  Journey Together is blessed with some great characters you can readily identify with, and each stop along the training pathway proves to be quite interesting in and of itself.  The final scenes are nothing short of gripping, as there is plenty of suspense - not to mention danger - built into Wilton's first taste of actual combat.  From start to finish, Journey Together is just a terrific wartime film that gives you at least some idea of what life in the RAF was like for the heroic men who carried out the bombing raids over Germany.",1137715200,6,3439,4.647933884297521
