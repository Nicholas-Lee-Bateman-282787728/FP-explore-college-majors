1920633,5,B0000D151U,"THIS is a quality martial arts (or is it yoga?) training video!
I've been a martial artist for 20 years, in arts ranging from karatedo, to various gung fu, south-east asian systems, jiu-jitsu and even crazy-ass full-contact, no-rules stick fighting (the infamous Dog Brothers).  And I've seen all manner of crappy training videos - I suspect the same people who make pornography also produce martial arts videos in their spare time.
I could only WISH that other martial arts videos could do as well as this one.  Not only is this a valuable reference in terms of content, it is, quite simply, very well made. Clean editting, professional camera work, tasteful settings, and even pacing set a standard that is to be envied.
Past the introduction, the structure and pacing of the material is very well suited to self-training at home in front of the television. Enough time is given to allow study and practice with minimum rewinding and pausing during the presentation. Unlike some videos that either seem devoid of real material or present far too quickly and discontinuously, it is clear that the author has given careful consideration to his audience and the challenges of training from video.
I have been a yoga convert for several years already so this isn't a hard sell to me.  The content is a natural fit as far as I am concerned.  I'm just thankful it comes in a worthwhile package!",1064966400,14,1390,4.803347280334728

I'm just realizing how important YOGA is especially when  practicing BJJ.",1522800000,,86,5.615384615384615
7999919,5,B0000D151U,"I got this video in order to pick up some example routines that I could use to warm up before combative class. (As I get older, Im less naturally flexible and want to avoid injury and do martial arts long term.)

The DVD is about 65 minutes long and has a number of routines. Im not a yoga expert but I have been going to yoga classes at multiple places with 4-5 different instructors for at least a year and I saw at least two or three moves that were new to me. It was also helpful to see the moves I was already familiar with since in class I cant stare at the instructor. The demos of the moves are shown and explained very methodically which is helpful to refine my yoga practice. Stephan is quite flexible but Josephine is the pro so when they both demo moves you see the less flexible and most flexible range of moves / motion. After an explanation of relationships with martial arts and benefits to a martial arts practitioner, there are 5 sections to the DVD:

- (1) Breathing exercises to work on breath awareness and control, mental focus and concentration, and increasing lung capacity.
- (2) Cat series is intended to awaken the body, work on spinal flexibility and articulation and core stability.
- (3) Sun Salutations
 Sun Salutation 1 is a warmup sequence focused on leg and back flexibility and breath-movement integration
 Sun Salutation 2 is a traditional whole boy warmup focused on core stability and flexibility as well as hamstring flexibility
 Sun Salutation 3 focuses on core stability and flexibility, hip and leg flexibility with balance development
 Sun Salutation 4 focuses on should strength and stabilization, leg and hip flexibility with balance development
- (4) Seated flow works core strength and stability, hip and leg flexibility, and left-right balancing (some challenging twists and tough moves like boat)
- (5) Supine (on your back) flow works core stability and flexibility, hip and back flexibility and ended with a suggested position for deep relaxation

I would recommend this for those who would like to do yoga at home or learn some routines to have them in your repertoire for when you want to work on different areas (or warm up!).",1487376000,2,2180,4.736147757255937
7999920,4,B0000D151U,"I primarily study defensive arts (hapkido), and I picked this up to increase my balance and flexibility. After going through the routine once or twice a week for several months, I can't imagine my weekly workouts without it. It's not an intense yoga series by any means--it definitely focuses on stretching and flexibility--so if you're looking to build strength, this probably isn't the right video for you. But after a few days of weight lifting and cardio in the gym, my muscles and joints begin to scream at me if I don't give them a yoga day, and I always turn to this video. I can honestly tell a significant difference in my flexibility.

The core of the practice runs about 45 minutes and can be performed easily without any previous yoga experience because Josephine is probably the best video instructor out there; she calls out even the smallest motion, tells you where and how to execute each pose correctly, and reminds you to shift your weight into the appropriate places. She and her male counterpart on the video also demonstrate both a beginner and a slightly more advanced posture for each pose. There is no chit-chat in this video, either; she only speaks to instruct, which I love. So many video routines are cluttered with the instructor's ""motivational"" talk, but Josephine just allows you to relax and concentrate on the stretches. The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is I wish there would have been a series in the video for more advanced strength/balance poses. (Josephine, please make a follow-up DVD!) But overall, this is an excellent buy. (In fact, I just came back and bought another copy as a gift for my training partner.)",1469577600,,1665,4.7612456747404845
7999921,5,B0000D151U,I didn't expect I could combine the two forms - yoga and martial arts.,1433289600,,70,4.071428571428571
7999922,5,B0000D151U,I got this product because I was hoping it would help me with my BJJ.  Doing the yoga in the dvd has helped me with my flexibility and my recovery.  I use some of the yoga poses in this dvd as a part of my warm up before I train and as a part of my group class warm ups as well.  A must see for any serious martial artist.,1433289600,,322,3.5714285714285716
7999923,5,B0000D151U,"This is an excellent Yoga DVD specifically geared for the martial artist.  It progresses smoothly and explains the details of the techniques demonstrated.  Stephan Kesting is an excellent expositor on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and his involvement in the project is quite reassuring, though after going through the DVD, its quality speaks for itself.

The quality of the film itself is also somewhat dated if you are accustomed to HD or Blu-Ray quality, though quite adequate for what is needed.

It is, however, rather expensive compared to many other Yoga DVDs.",1421366400,,556,5.144444444444445
7999924,3,B0000D151U,As someone that has been in the martial arts for yrs and never really did yoga i thought it would be a great place to start.  The pace of the DVD is a little fast for beginners.  There are no subtitles so slowing the video down is pointless since you can not hear what they are saying.  There is a lot of good info but not really a first yoga DVD.,1361577600,,347,3.859154929577465
7999925,3,B0000D151U,"As a longterm martial artist, I bought this DVD, seeking yoga instruction that would bring me a combination of strength and flexibility.  I've since studied more Yoga on the net, exploring different poses, etc.  As such, I've found this tape okay for a beginner, but really limited.  Where are the balance poses, which would make alot of sense for a martial artist?  Also, this DVD is broken into different modules (4 different Sun Salutations, Seated poses, etc.)  It would have been helpful if there had been some instruction as to combinations of modules to use in one session (ie: one sun saluation, two other modules, or similar.)  So...I give this a qualified recommendation, but only for basic yoga beginners.",1180828800,6,716,4.974789915966387
7999926,3,B0000D151U,"Most martial artists who train regularly would be a lot better off with any of Baron Baptiste's hot yoga tapes or Bryan Kests Power Yoga tapes.  There is nothing wrong with this tape, but I think most athletic martial artists would enjoy the balance, breathing, strength and relaxation opportunities of a fuller, deeper, more challenging practice.  After all, a lot of M.A. people are already pretty flexible and athletic.  Just wanted people to know there are more interesting videos out there.  Also, the price is outrageous given the content.  The tapes I mentioned are less than half the price of this one.",1103155200,24,610,4.9411764705882355
