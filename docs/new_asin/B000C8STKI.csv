2453903,5,B000C8STKI,"We LOVE this movie. Don't understand why it was not a mass release. It's a great heartwarming story of how love can change a life. I wish that all kids could see this movie and learn its lesson.

The acting is great and the story wonderful.",1169424000,2,240,4.217391304347826
2453904,5,B000C8STKI,"Well I knew nothing about this movie.  Turned on the TV and there it was.  Was captivated by Jonathon Lipnicki.  What an adorable little boy.  Reminded me of a nephew of mine.  The movie also had Eric Stolz in it, good as he always is.  It's a cute movie about a boy who is billed as the Fattest boy in the world, that's Zachary coming into town.  It's a movie with a good message about life and innocence.  Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.",1165276800,12,449,4.1395348837209305
2453905,4,B000C8STKI,"I'm the last person to take kindly to any overtly religious promotion or overtones.  In this case, my take on the baptism deal is: it was important to the poor kid, a kid who had little to grasp except for what his mother said and that was that he'd need to be baptized to see her in heaven.  Yes, I almost cringed when the kids were reading passages from the bible.  But, as said, it was something important to the kid and his friends sought a solution.  (This, nonetheless, did result in a reduced star in my rating.)  But I didn't feel the movie was preachy or overly moralistic. Overall, it was a treat, well acted with darling kids, a message of tolerance, portrayals of unfairness in life, etc.  I thought the flick was a gem.",1156291200,4,732,4.345588235294118
2453906,2,B000C8STKI,"The people making this movie made a decision that it was more important to impart a moral than to be entertaining. That's unfortunate. In fact, that's my biggest complaint when it comes to ""family"" movies and movies aimed at kids. I think that a movie should be entertaining first and that any moral should flow naturally from the story, not be forcibly squeezed from it! That being said, this movie was for the most part pleasant and on the verge of actually being entertaining. The unnatural thing about this movie is how the characters decide that baptising Zachary Beaver is so overwhelmingly important. The whole baptism thing is sort of a non sequitur. The only saving grace here is that there was at least a small morsel of humor thrown in every now and then to keep the movie from getting disproportionally serious. In some ways this movie comes across more as a propaganda piece than as an actual attempt at honest entertainment.",1145145600,7,938,4.7607361963190185
2453907,3,B000C8STKI,"A cute predictable story based on an old novel, When Zachary Beaver Came To Town is the story of two boys and the summer that changed their lives, which just happens to co-inside with the arrival of the world's fattest boy visiting their small Texas town. This movie isn't bad, but the story is inconsistent and jumps around quite a bit. At times, it seems as thou Zachary is just a quirky side character rather than the focus of the film. Both the young leads are fantastic thou and the young southern belle character was just hilarious. It's a cute movie, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for something fun and simple, check it out.",1361664000,,659,4.5
2453908,5,B000C8STKI,"Good flick
No missiles or explosions or super-villians so it's definitely a different read for most boys but very good.",1358467200,,119,5.0
2453909,5,B000C8STKI,"Zachary Beaver Comes to Town is a wonderful book for pre-teens, especially boys, who might need to begin to recognise some of the deeper issues that other kids have to cope with (Or perhaps for kids who themselves are dealing with uncomfortable issues). This book touches upon many thought provoking ideas, what is love? Who is ""cool"", how does one judge others who might be over weight or ""different"" than the general population? The book shows us how although we might at first tend to pass judgement rather quickly, we are often wrong and perhaps it's best to investigate before moving on to the decisions we make about others. And what if someone chooses to live a life that may seem odd or not as stable as our own? Are they wrong? This book makes one think but at the same time as they are laughing, and what better way to learn than while having a good time? Read this book! You'll have a good time and learn a few things about human beings at the same time.",1350777600,,965,4.426966292134831
2453910,5,B000C8STKI,Great movie.  My 13 year old son read this book as part of a reading class assignment.  Afterwards we bought the movie to help him see the book.  No bad language and had a nice moral about acceptance.,1308268800,3,200,4.2105263157894735
2453911,4,B000C8STKI,"I purchased this movie to use in my 6th grade special education classroom as a follow up to our read-aloud of the novel, ""When Zachary Beaver Came to Town"".  The movie was cute, it followed the novel plot line pretty well, and brought the characters to ""life"" for my students.  It allows great discussions about how student's images of the characters from the novel compared to the actors who portrayed them in the movie.  They all agreed that Zachary's personality in the movie was very different from how we perceived it in the novel.  I enjoy being able to share a movie version of a text with my students and this one was not a disappointment!",1278288000,2,647,4.551724137931035
2453912,5,B000C8STKI,"Like another reviewer here, I am a teacher who purchased this movie to go along with reading the book ""When Zachary Beaver Came to Town"".

The film is a great compliment to the book, and a good family movie in it's own right.

There is plenty here to discuss - prejudice, loss, friendship - for either the classroom or a family film night.  Keep a little Kleenix handy, though.  There are some tear jerking aspects.",1227657600,4,415,4.493333333333333
2453913,3,B000C8STKI,"Interesting coming of age film with the story centering around two friends who befriend an obese boy in a makeshift sideshow. The film is a cut above most juvenile fodder with some funny and interesting characters. Amanda Alch is a stand out as a pint sized southern bell! It's clean and short and the story isn't dumb-ed down, so adults can enjoy this film too. I caught this on cable, so I don't know what the DVD quality is.",1225843200,2,427,4.417721518987341
2453914,5,B000C8STKI,"I was looking for a DVD film of the book ""When Zachary Beaver Came To Town"" to tie into a lesson plan for a literature unit for that novel. The first place I always check is Amazon and low and behold I located the DVD and at a great price!",1200096000,2,239,3.8
2453915,5,B000C8STKI,Wonderful movie for families.  Depicts prejudice in a small town and the lessons learned by a boy and his friends.  Very well done.  Our family thoroughly enjoyed it!,1195776000,2,166,4.857142857142857
2453916,5,B000C8STKI,We watched this as a family and we all enjoyed it! Even the youngest granddaughter who is only four was able to stay with it. I loved the dynamics of the of the developing relationships between the boys. How special to see kids showing empathy and being sympathic at such a young age.  I especially enjoyed the Baptism scene in the lake and what it represented to Zachary! Overall I thought the whole movie was fun and entertaining for all!,1176681600,4,440,4.5

8096328,5,B000C8STKI,I had read the book (When Zachary Beaver Comes to Town) and loved the book.  It was fun to see the characters come to life.  The movie followed the book pretty much but did make a few changes.  Well done.,1470614400,,204,4.05

8096330,4,B000C8STKI,"I bought this for my 6th grade literature class.  We read the book in class, and I thought it would be fun to watch the movie too.  First, the plot is very jumbled up-events happen in a different order than in the book, and of course, with most movies made from books, other plot points are added to make the movie interesting.  While this isn't that big of a deal, what is a big deal is the language in the film.  There is unnecessary curse words that are making me wonder if I can show the film in class (i.e. the g-d word, fat a**).  I was excited to watch this with my class, but now I'm just glad I previewed it, since I'm worried if I show it, I may have some angry parents to contend with.

It's too bad the language is in the film:  it's unnecessary, and it doesn't help the plot of the film move forward.",1445644800,3,813,4.04375
8096331,4,B000C8STKI,"This is a low-key but very well done, character-driven movie.  The plot moves along, and nothing is perfect at the end, but we do see the difference kindness makes in the lives of others and in our own lives.  Catch it if you can!",1436745600,,230,4.204545454545454
8096332,5,B000C8STKI,It was perfect for connecting the novel to characters on screen.,1433289600,,64,4.909090909090909

8096336,5,B000C8STKI,"A delightfully ordinary slice of life family drama. Toby (Jonathan Lipnicki) and Cal (Cody Linley) are best friends growing up in a small Texas town, who learn, for the first time, to face the trials of life. Just as Toby's mother leaves town, and Cal's brother leaves for the army, fourteen year old Zachary Beaver (Sascha Joseph Neulinger), the self styled ""World's Fattest Boy"" rolls into town with his sideshow act.",1388016000,,419,4.915492957746479
