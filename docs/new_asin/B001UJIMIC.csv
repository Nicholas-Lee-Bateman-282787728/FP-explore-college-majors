The cast are all good looking and likeable and almost too perfect, even the cheating husband.  I also think the movie was played for laughs, and not at all serious. But it wasn't a total let down.

3802050,2,B001UJIMIC,"I have watched this film twice. The first time I wasn't able to jump into it and really give it an objective view but watching it a second time, I come to the same conclusion. I know that its an independent film and the budget was sub-par at best but it still could have brought a greater depth to it. Reading the synopsis for the film, I was thinking that things would unfold like a Lifetime movie and we wouldn't know he had another wife until halfway in and from there it would be a deeper plot unfolding of trying to confront him about his wife or plotting against him in general.

Yet, not even 10 minutes into the film and we have found out he's already married and she is feeling like a fool. After that, the plot just goes in a crazy direction with her hearing the thoughts of men and it never being explained how it happened. They gave more depth into this with the film What Women Want with Mel Gibson hearing women's thoughts after a freak accident. That was more believable than this film's star simply going to sleep after doing research and all of a sudden hearing men's thoughts.

It just doesn't make much sense. If the cast wasn't attractive, I would have stopped watching it and not giving it a shot. The music was poorly selected. The opening credits made no sense. The only scene that made me laugh out loud was when Kayla is speaking with Sean and Sean has a passenger in his taxi and he and the passenger begin yelling back and forth. That made me laugh. The rest of the movie left me wondering how Kayla is able to just travel without a moment's notice as a teacher and why the one girlfriend comes across like a 3rd wheel throughout the film. All the way around, the movie could have done better and allowed the actors/actresses to really act versus the foolishness that I watched. Like, her level of crazy with the kids was ridiculous. I have worked in the public school sector and no way she would have been able to act like she did with the boys. I was really confused when she went on that field trip with no other adults and leaving the kids unattended. It was just all non-plausible.",1457222400,,2113,4.346835443037975

3802135,4,B001UJIMIC,"OK so this movie was so bad its kinda good. There are a lot of things that can be attributed to bad acting. Like when the lead was writing with her left hand and it was obvious she wasn't even making anything close to letters let alone words, or how in the only sex scene the people having sex were fully clothed, zippers closed but moaning like they were still doing it, the lady also keeps moaning after the guy gets off her... but it's not like they took an amazing script and ruined it even the story left a lot lacking. But when you put all that mess in a pot what you get is a movie you want to watch again with someone who can point out all the terrible stuff to you so you can laugh. By the way it seems like the acting got better near the end, not sure why but maybe they should have gone back and redone the first hour idk...",1431302400,,835,3.9761904761904763

This is definitely a good film for friends to watch together or with that special someone - and no I don't write for Hallmark!

Children and sexual content should never be portrayed in movies. The child's mother and father were very irresponsible for allowing their child to be portrayed in that image (which is why I gave it 2 stars). When will the media set a standard?

I could see this being a good mood lifter after a breakup or just a fun movie night with friends....I look forward to seeing more from this cast.",1369612800,4,511,4.483870967741935

3802230,4,B001UJIMIC,"Though this movie is not full of familiar faces, it is still worthy watching. It is such a sweet story. The acting especially with the kids is so innocent and pure. We need more of this kind of movie out there....it gives a nice form of raw acting which many A-listed Hollywood movies lack lately. Kudos to the producers and actors. Good job!",1367020800,3,342,4.444444444444445
3802231,4,B001UJIMIC,A movie for a great laugh and talented cast given a basic script. The lead character singing was impressive and a natural talent. A girly movie. Enjoy,1366502400,,150,4.592592592592593
3802232,1,B001UJIMIC,"Wow that was pretty bad. I was hoping it would get better but it just sucked. If the cast weren't attractive, I wouldn't have made it to the end of the movie. It was very unrealistic.",1365379200,2,183,4.111111111111111

3802235,1,B001UJIMIC,This movie's storyline seemed interesting (at first) but after the initial hotel room scene I could not get pass the semi-professional acting.,1362528000,,142,5.5

3802237,3,B001UJIMIC,I liked it.  It needed more spice.  You can't blame all men because of one man's mistakes or bad ways.,1357516800,,102,4.05
3802238,1,B001UJIMIC,This movie was a waste of time. The acting was amateurish and the story line was very predictable. I kept doing other things  on my computer just so the story could move along. I wouldn't recommend it to be honest. Spend your time on something else,1357084800,,248,4.391304347826087
3802239,4,B001UJIMIC,"Its a little budgeted but aside from that, the situation is realistic and the leads are attractive. That little boy had me laughing. I definitely laughed quite a few times. Id love to watch this again with a group of people.",1345334400,,224,4.487804878048781

3802241,5,B001UJIMIC,This movie starts out a little rough. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the acting and quality. This film is HILARIOUS!!!!!! I had a blast watching it and recommend this to any one who needs a quick tickle. It is real life situations and real life solutions. Watch at your own risk but enjoy at your leisure.,1344643200,3,321,4.366666666666666

Its better than any of the tyler perry theatrical releases. Anyone who gave this movie a bad review has below average intelligence. Please see this film.",1321142400,2,321,4.75
3802244,2,B001UJIMIC,"Is it Sundance, that little logo I see on the cover? Ten minutes into the movie I started searching for movie reviews to see if I was being too hard on this movie. Most reviews are pretty bad. Acting is close to horrible and obviously there was not alot of money to make this movie but still it could have easily been much better. Two stars is a gift. Wishing for the days of Love Jones, The Best Man, or Two Can Play That Game...",1311811200,,430,4.070588235294117
3802245,5,B001UJIMIC,"This movie was a wonderful portrayal of life from the perspective of a young teacher, whose love in life is taken away quite suddenly. What was at stake and how she manages the stress of working, playing, finding relationship and staying focused was a true challenge. Kayla brings to light a character of such richness and wisdom. She has the courage to keep moving in space, protected by what new awareness arise,  and while in the process she receives many gifts and gives gifts as well.

 How do you bridge your work life with the values you are trying to teach to students? I loved the themes that threaded this whole piece together. Her students...their own struggles and triumphs carried so much about community and growth. I loved that she found a way to work through the trauma and the gift she was given to help herself and her students.

I loved this movie, the characters and how the story was played out. It was rich, interesting and fulfilling. Just when you thought you knew what was going to happen next, a new twist took you someplace unexpected. Kareem Molake's story is a love story and a very human story, romantic, compassionate and uplifting. And just plain hilarious at times, with a few sad moments too!

The only issue I have: Where is the soundtrack? I would love to have the music.

3802246,4,B001UJIMIC,"One could tell that ametuer actors were used. Some acted better than others. Ayo (new boyfriend)did a good job. The first male actor was not so good. The story line was nice and I'm sure it's every woman's wish to hear the thoughts of a man. Sure would save time. Overall, a good film if you just want something interesting to pass time.",1286582400,,337,4.365079365079365

3802248,2,B001UJIMIC,"Ok the acting was horrible, it was definitely an amateur work but I guess exposure for the lead actress Sherial McKinney et al. She looks so much like a younger Halle Berry, without trying but also seemed to try to act like her as well. the story reminded me of a cross between Boomerang with the Eddie cheating on her and coming back and it reminds me about a reverse role of the movie where the guy can read women's thoughts. It doesn't explain how that happened for her to hear men's thoughts other than she woke up in the library and read a bunch of books. It was predictable in that you knew how the movie ended.  I can't believe I watched this  but I skipped through this after the first five minutes. I surfed the net most of the time.",1269043200,24,742,4.21830985915493
