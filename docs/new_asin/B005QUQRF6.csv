8483770,5,B005QUQRF6,"Well, these 2 have seen enough of each other, and can't get enough of each other, because both of them want to obliterate the other! Gray Maynard beat Frankie Edgar by a unanimous decision on a UFC Fight Night, and before UFC 144, it was Edgar's only loss. At UFC 125, these 2 put on an unforgettable performance, and there was a lingering GASP that left fans breathless when a DRAW was announced. So at UFC 136, let's do this again, this time for all the marbles, somebody take the other out already!! That is the Main Event for UFC 136. Gray ""The Whiner"" Maynard wants Edgar's title.

The Co-Main Event features Jose Aldo defending his Featherweight belt against a man who's already fought for the belt twice and come up short, Kenny Florian. Will Florian finally take what he wants?

Oh yeah, and Big Mouth is back! Big Mouth hungry, want Anderson Silva, fight Brian Stann. Big Mouth get wish? Yep. Chael is back.

What can I say? This is UFC 136, there are 11 fights on this card, and I'm listing all of 'em below!

Steve Cantwell vs. Mike Massenzio: You figure this couldn't be too incredibly tough for Cantwell. Right? Well, if Mike has anything to disput such a statement, he's going to make every attempt to prove that Cantwell's in his way. And it is a unanimous decision.

Aaron Simpson vs. Eric Schafer: ""Red"" can certainly tap people, and the ""A-Train"" always comes to dominate. This is 30-27 across the board. Unanimous decision.

Tie Quan Zhang vs. Darren Elkins: Both of these guys have their strengths, but one of 'em has a little more strength than the other. And this is a unanimous decision too!

Joey Beltran vs. Stipe Miocic: You know that Beltran loves to bang it out with the best of them, but this Croatian is ready to introduce himself to Joey, and to UFC fans. This is a great performance, and a unanimous decision!

Anthony Pettis vs. Jeremy Stephens: Ok, it's Stephens, and it's Pettis! Expect a scrap, and if these guys can't knock each other out, expect a split decision. That's exactly what happened!

Demian Maia vs. Jorge Santiago: Both of these guys are crafty, but one of them is a lot better, dominating the other with a unanimous decision.

Melvin Guillard vs. Joe Lauzon: These guys ain't afraid of each other! And one of 'em stuns the other, and gets a submission within less than a minute!

Leonard Garcia vs. Nam Phan: Who was pissed off when Nam made his debut at his TUF Finale? I know I was, and Garcia is pissed that people think Phan won. This is an awesome FIGHT OF THE NIGHT performance, and it's a clear cut unanimous decision, NO QUESTION who won this one.

Chael Sonnen vs. Brian Stann: I suppose regardless of Chael's big mouth, he has respect for Stann, but the intentions are clear. People can enjoy or dislike the outcome of this one, and the post-fight interview is obnoxious, but all him. He gets a 2nd round tap, a first for this fighter in the UFC. And then Anderson Silva shows him at UFC 148 why he shouldn't run his mouth so much. Good performance, just gets on the easiest of nerves sometimes.

Jose Aldo vs. Kenny Florian: This is a tough scrap the whole way through, but Aldo keeps his belt, and Florian eventually announced his retirement afterward. Now he does some announcing! But this is a unanimous decision, and memorable.

Frankie Edgar vs. Gray Maynard III: Gray Maynard got knocked out in the 4th round! Yes, I am being a spoiler, because Maynard never fails to get on my nerves. He may have gotten a 3-round decision back at a Fight Night, but Edgar knocked him out, and Maynard probably sucked his thumb after it happened. Too bad for him!

And I walk away happy after this one. You don't like it? Too bad. I LOVED IT!!!",1361750400,,3696,4.52023988005997
8483771,5,B005QUQRF6,"If you are a big frankie edgar fan like i am, this is a must have. Gray was frankies only loss, there meeting in january was bullshit. Edgar won that fight, and frankie knocks out gray. Gray is a low life, i say go frankie",1346544000,,222,3.9555555555555557
8483772,3,B005QUQRF6,"The main fights I wanted to see on this card was Edgar vs Maynard 3, Aldo vs Florian, and Lauzon vs Guillard. I was also excited to see Chael Sonnen come back. I think the main event of Edgar vs Maynard 3 deleivered as did the Lauzon vs Guillard match; but from top to bottom this card was just average compared to the rest.",1339632000,,324,4.078125
8483773,2,B005QUQRF6,"there were too many judges decision in this event.

i liked first round finishes of knocks and submission more than judges decisions.",1327363200,,133,5.045454545454546
8483774,5,B005QUQRF6,"This is the one pay-per-view of the year that as I saw the finalization of the main card come together I began to think to myself, ""This card doesn't need anyone hyping it for it to sell"" and that is exactly what I got.  The talent pool alone for this card made it a must see from start to finish.

Starting things off are Melvin Guillard fighting Joe Lauzon.  I'm a fan of both fighters, each having unique and exciting styles to their name and guessing how these two would play out was a really interesting prospect.  This fight started out fast and ended just as quickly in a finish that had me stunned.  Needless to say you'll wanna watch this fight and don't blink cause it's a short one.

Most would agree that Nam Phan was screwed in his last fight against Leonard Garcia.  In my opinion he clearly won that fight but the decision was given to Garcia.  Phan and Garcia met once more to set the record straight and it was one hell of a fight.  In the first two rounds a technical boxing clinic was put on with what looked like a clear shut-out in terms of ability and then, in traditional Garcia-style fights, we see an insane third round with a lot of the technique witnessed earlier in the fight going out the window.  If you're like me this is one of those great fights where although there's obviously someone who goes home with the victory this is the kind of fight where both guys walk away winners with love from the crowd and a well deserved standing ovation.

Personally this was the fight that I had picked for fight of the night, cause win or lose I was gonna be treated to a war where both guys would come in and fight.  Chael Sonnen is the man who nearly dethroned middleweight champion Anderson Silva last August, in what is one of my favorite fights ever, and he hasn't fought since with a tirade of legal woes keeping him from competition.  Unfortunately his return fight isn't against an easy opponent either, that man being Brian Stann.  Stann has been on an absolute tear of the middleweight division as of late and was looking extremely scary coming into this fight.  Thankfully I was not disappointed when it came to this fight, although being something of a one-sided domination, it was excited from beginning to end with a second round finish.  Make sure you watch the post-fight interview for this one people because this is in my opinion the moment that many will come to define this pay-per-view in the coming months by.

Jose Aldo didn't look incredibly strong in his last outing against Mark Hominick at UFC 129, mostly attributed to a tough weight cut, but I was really looking forward to this fight, eager that the man who had shown such amazing technical striking and finishes would return to take on the newest challenger to his throne, Kenny Florian.  If you've been following since the first season of the Ultimate Fighter you know that Florian has had a crappy streak when it comes to title shots.  He was shut down twice by Sherk and Penn respectively in their lightweight bouts and was now looking to test his luck against Aldo in the featherweight division.  The fight itself followed along a much more grinding pace than I had anticipated.  I really thought that this would be a striker's game but it ended up playing more along a battle in the clinch, which led to some really frustrating periods but overall it was a decent fight that went to the decision.  I definitely think the right person walked away with the belt.

In the main event we get the third bout between Frankie Edgar and Gray Maynard.  Their last fight will likely go down as the best fight of the year so far and is absolute classic.  Unfortunately it ended in a draw, leaving the question: what happens next?  Thankfully Dana put together Edgar/Maynard III so we could put an end to the debate.  As for the fight itself, it lived up to the hype and then it didn't.  This is truly one of the rare fights that had me experiencing all of the many emotions I tend to associate with a great and boring fight: ""jumping-out-of-my-seat"" joy, ""screaming-at-the-screen"" frustration, and then stunned silence.  It's gonna answer most of the questions left behind from the last fight and then some.  Definitely a fight ya need to see to believe.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this card, a lot of exciting fights and finishes wrapped together and boy did the anticipation pay off for this one.  May not be the best overall card of the year but a definite buy for myself anyways.",1318118400,8,4491,4.5334987593052105
