Haven't laughed so much in ages. Would recommend to anyone in need of a laugh.",1351209600,,173,4.40625
8462292,5,B002XG74QW,"The DVD's arrived promptly and in good condition. We have put that code that you can find into our DVD player, so we can play any British DVD.
We have just watched one of the DVD's so far, as they were both supposed to be for Christmas, but I couldn't wait. It's Peter Kay when he started out.
Very pleased. We chose these DVD's as the other reviews said they contained original material and not rehash of other DVD's , so this is why I bought them. Like the content and it's not too blue, so you can watch it with the kids.",1291680000,,524,4.097087378640777
