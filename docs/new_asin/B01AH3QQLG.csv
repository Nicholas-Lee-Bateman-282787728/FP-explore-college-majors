7600910,1,B01AH3QQLG,"This movie is in a foreign language with Subtitles - NO WHERE in the trailer (they spoke English in the trailer) did it say you would have to 'read' the movie.  No indication it was a foreign film, will be requesting my money back",1462320000,,230,4.2272727272727275
7600911,5,B01AH3QQLG,"this was very suspenseful and well acted.  No special effects, no ridiculous plot twist where we find out she's a man or every one in the morgue comes to life.  Just a straight out suspenseful cool movie.  Oh yes it's Spanish and not in English which seems to have upset several reviewers.  the thought of other countries making movies in their own language threw them for a loop.  but it's a great movie.",1462233600,8,405,4.493150684931507
7600912,4,B01AH3QQLG,"A bit short, but suspenseful enough.",1461888000,,36,5.166666666666667
7600913,5,B01AH3QQLG,"This was surprisingly a very dark and interesting movie.  Despite the fact that I had to follow reading the English subs I enjoyed this sick, twisted story line.  Be aware that there is nudity and graphic violence and sexual scenes, but even though that's not my thing when it comes to a good flick the story in this is just bizarre, and sickly it could happen.  Imagine, an A list actor/actress, movie star winds up in the morgue, and the morbid curiosity of seeing such an out of touch to the general public person so close (yet unfortunately dead). What would you do?  Take a selfie? Tell your friends? Whatever your moral compass this is the story of just such a scenario and what three friends do with access to the body of a superstar.  Even though there were parts that I had to cover my eyes or look away and say, OMG! I still found the dilemma these guys found themselves in interesting.  Very surprisingly sick twisted film, with excellent, believable actors.",1461628800,14,969,4.572254335260116
7600914,5,B01AH3QQLG,very good movie would have liked it in english though,1461369600,,53,4.4

7600916,1,B01AH3QQLG,Not very good,1460937600,,13,3.6666666666666665
7600917,4,B01AH3QQLG,The movie was good but the dvd leaves a lot to be desired. The picture has a jerky quality during playback. It appears to be a interlaced transfer.,1459814400,5,147,4.285714285714286
7600918,5,B01AH3QQLG,I saw this movie last year at SXSW. It was my favorite film of the festival! It kept me on my seat the entire time! A must watch for thriller fans!,1456790400,8,147,3.774193548387097
7600919,2,B01AH3QQLG,A psychological thriller which delves into some pretty dark places.  Definitely not for the squeamish.,1508630400,,102,5.8
7600920,2,B01AH3QQLG,"actually i had watched autopsy of jane doe before i did this so i thought this was some spanish version, i was wrong.
my problem with this movie is it lacks of explanation of what happened, so i can also therefore think of it as a joke that a famous actress maybe just passed out but then she was sent to morgue and she became awake because some perverts just screwed her. then she was pissed off.... a pervert joke. nothing spooky.",1501372800,3,432,4.280487804878049

7600922,1,B01AH3QQLG,Subtitles..and just plain stupid actions..a real low budget movie...,1483920000,,68,6.666666666666667
7600923,4,B01AH3QQLG,I really liked this movie...,1483833600,,28,4.8
7600924,4,B01AH3QQLG,"Fantastic movie.  I love horror that tackles the dormant lizard brain inside of us all.  Hunt or be hunted.  Survive or perish.  A 20 something works in the morgue on the night a famous actress is brought in after her tragic death.  He snaps a few pics and sends them to his buddies who jump at the chance to see her naked.  Looking, turns to touching, which leads to even worse.  It's a horrific story about three friends who get in over their heads very quickly.  Honestly the whole scenario seems quite plausible, and the acting is top notch.  There are a few missed opportunities to add tension but overall, the script is lean and mean and if you like stories about the horror that man is capable of, this is well worth a watch.  I'm sure there will be an American remake, and maybe that's a good thing.  It's too good of a premise to not enjoy a wider audience.",1482883200,2,866,4.316770186335404
7600925,5,B01AH3QQLG,"Or dear Lord, what an adventure in girl power. We don't do these stories in the U.S., not like this. You won't know what's coming next!",1474243200,,135,4.230769230769231

7600927,1,B01AH3QQLG,"Don't waste your time or money on this very predictable movie. It was ok, but nothing setting aside time for...",1472169600,,111,4.6
7600928,3,B01AH3QQLG,"wasn't sure weather it should be 3 or 4...well made, written, and acted, but so horrible i felt traumatized.
smart movie though: the horror wasn't blood and gore but came from an accurate presentation of some of the worst parts of the human psyche, particularly the ugly way many men look at women.
but there also was a good portrayal of the leader/follower relationship which ultimately leads basically decent people to commit atrocities under the influence of a strong, psychopathic leader.",1471392000,,492,5.08641975308642

7600933,4,B01AH3QQLG,Thankfully I know some Spanish...but you have to read subtitles the whole movie... Not overly fond of that.,1468108800,,107,5.0
7600934,5,B01AH3QQLG,Intelligent thriller which is actually a horror story for Anna. Original story.,1467849600,,79,5.666666666666667
7600935,4,B01AH3QQLG,"A movie about Necrophilia, well almost (Spoiler Alert) silly idea but delivered with impact. Three guys wanting to party, one alpha male, one wimp and a geek that happens to be working at the hospital morgue. After some typical drug paraphernalia interaction between the three, the alpha decides to have a little fun with the freshest piece of meat that has recently arrived at the morgue, that would be of course Anna. The wimp, skips his turn as expected and the geek ends up with sloppy Anna seconds. We guess he has a ""magic wand"" because for some unexplained reason, Anna is no longer a corpse because she comes back to life. There is never a real explanation as to how Anna became a corpse or how she was able to cheat death, there were no signs of any zombie related reanimation, Anna had no interest in brains. The interaction between the three males and what to do with Anna gets completely out of control as expected, as is the ending, a bizarre yet, entertaining late evening flick, just make sure you can read or speck Spanish since this movie non-English speaking with subtitles.",1467590400,5,1092,4.634020618556701
7600936,1,B01AH3QQLG,I could not watch.  Stopped watching a few minutes after it started.  Disgusting!,1467244800,,81,5.153846153846154
7600937,4,B01AH3QQLG,This is a pretty good horror flick. I like it.,1466553600,,46,3.7
7600938,3,B01AH3QQLG,"When necrophilia is the starter for your movie's engine, one would expect something a bit depraved or at least perverse. ""Anna Fritz"" starts off that way. Three coke-snorting friends ogle the body of the beautiful and recently deceased actress Anna Fritz. One admits that he had sex - only once - with a dead woman and a second male suggests that they take a ride on Anna Fritz. Friend One seems aroused as Friend Two mounts and violates the dead woman. Friend Three is having no parts of any of it. But when Friend One takes his turn on Anna, well, Anna wakes up. And that's when the fun begins. At least, it should have. But it doesn't. Instead of continuing down the perverse road it's begun, Anna Fritz becomes a paint-by-numbers thriller. There's nothing here you haven't seen before and most of it you will see coming long before the characters do. Shame! Because the premise is ripe with opportunities for cheeky fun. Unfortunately, what we are given is devoid of suspense or horror. We should be glad that Anna woke up. But the truth is she was more fun when she was a corpse.",1466121600,2,1084,4.535714285714286

7600944,3,B01AH3QQLG,"I had low expectations going in based on the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Acting was good, shot decently, with a delightfully disturbing plot (if you're into that kind of thing, which I am).",1463875200,,202,4.8
7600945,1,B01AH3QQLG,This is a Spanish language movie......There are bad subtitles,1463616000,,61,5.888888888888889
7600946,1,B01AH3QQLG,"A slow build leaves you with no payoff. This is a film that you've seen before and it is not that good. I don't know where these stellar reviews come from. The ""dead girl"" is not believable at all and the decisions made by the men are realistic. They are so scared to be caught that two people are thought murdered yet blood spilled on the floor isn't even wiped up? And what about the biological evidence left with Anna? All in all there are a lot of plot errors. Not tight at all. Perhaps another editor could improve things. It was one of those films were you hate a character because he is just soo stupid! A definitive waste of money!",1463616000,2,639,4.245901639344262
7600947,1,B01AH3QQLG,"After seeing the previews I thought it might be a good choice.  I was very unhappy to find that it was not in English.  I hate subtitles.  Why doesn't Amazon give movies some type of code for customers to know before purchasing a movie that it is not in English!! Well, if that wasn't enough, after 5 minutes the movie stopped playing.  Although I restarted it several times it would stop to buffer and not come back on!! That was almost 6 dollars totally wasted.",1463270400,2,463,4.411764705882353

8747380,4,B01AH3QQLG,"This is a dark, intense horror movie that runs under 80 minutes, wasting no time with build up and jumping right into a tense, riveting experience. Atmosphere and polished visuals are the main draws. Visit my site for a full review!",1534896000,,232,4.682926829268292

8747384,4,B01AH3QQLG,"I'm a huge horror buff and I've always liked foreign horror, especially spanish horror.  Spain always seems to have some very original and creepy concepts.  This was one of them.  No special effects or huge twists with super natural elements, etc.  It's just a story of three friends who get themselves into a jam and keep digging themselves deeper and deeper.

I would recommend this to any horror fan.  It's not a movie i'd watch again, but it was definitely worth a watch.",1523750400,,475,4.662650602409639

8747387,1,B01AH3QQLG,"Literally only 3 minutes in, and the main characters spew a bunch of racist comments about Asian/Chinese women about how they're all ""submissive"", ""ugly"", ""flat chested"", ""only good for pimping"" and worships whites. This wasn't even remotely connected to the plot. This part of the movie had nothing to do with anything, yet the scriptwriter/directors saw fit to use this movie to further their own racist agendas.

Spain, Britain/Australia, and soon, amerikkka, will all be has-been, failing countries overtaken by a rising dragon, China. It's so painfully obvious whites are trying to hold on to their past glories by stereotyping, dehumanizing, and insulting Asians in any and every way they can. It's not enough any ""news articles"" by the white media attacks Asians in every way possible, whites also try to use their movies to dehumanize Asians.

Yellow peril 2.0 in the 21st century, everyone. It's only socially acceptable to be racist to Asians these days.

Also not surprised non of the other 34 reviewers said anything about the blatant racism, just proves my point even more - whites are normalizing anti-Asian sentiment and hatred.",1514246400,,1143,5.167567567567567
