3105564,5,B0013F60IW,"As someone who's been interested in & involved with the sustainability movement for a long time now Mike Reynolds (the ""hero"" of this documentary) is the type of individual I wish I could have crossed paths with, worked with & learned from in person!  This film documents his evolutionary journey from his first buildings in the New Mexico desert to his entrance into the legal arena facing an uphill battle to pass a bill that would allow architects the freedom to experiment with building designs in a controlled environment, to make mistakes & learn from them.  Michael presents a compelling case, both to stodgy legislators as well as the audience that this is not only a good idea but absolutely necessary.  The essence of his message is that we must redesign society (not just the building codes) to be able to adapt forcefully & gracefully to rapid change.  It's a story about unexpected obstacles and the power of an adaptable & persistent spirit in overcoming them.  The film takes us to India's Andaman Islands where Mr. Reynolds uses his unconventional building technique to rebuild a community devastated by tsunami and demonstrates how swift positive change can be when not hampered by ideological resistance and red tape.  The pacing & flow of the movie are perfect, the musical score is great as well, complimentary to the action & powerful without being overwhelming (or overdramatic).  It is even humorous at times like the ""romantic"" tune playing while Mike's newfound ally (a converted knight for his cause from within the system) works her way through a sea of resistant & skeptical senators to help try to get his bill passed.

Garbage Warrior will not give you the latest cutting edge information about sustainable design (though it certainly is a great primer), nor is it a full biography of Mr. Reynolds (though it covers the period of his life relevant to the film superbly) or of the ins, outs & tangents of the Earthship movement.

3105570,5,B0013F60IW,"Garbage warrior chronicles the story of Michael Reynolds, an eco-architect who left the traditional world of architecture in order to follow his dream of building homes that allow people to take care of themselves in a fully sustainable way. Although depicted by his wife as stubborn, unusual and one-track minded, dismissing Reynolds as an idyllic hippy is difficult after the focus shifts from Reynolds eccentric nature to his creations. Earthships are off-the-grid, 100% sustainable homes built out of what modern society throws away in abundance, such as bottles, cans and tires. While the initial idea may bring to mind images of garbage huts, the homes are beautifully crafted oases intended to provide everything the inhabitant needs for survival. The homes sit on 6,000 gallons of water from collected rainfall, have internalized sewage, grow food, and use no energy. Reynolds presents the homes from a very idealist perspective, speaking of creating tropical farm havens with abundant wildlife. While the idyllic representation may at first seem unrealistic, the film continues on to show how conceivable the self-sustainable concept of living actually is.
Throughout the film Reynolds hammers in the importance of trial and error in his process, as his bold endeavors are indeed experimental. In fact, the experimental nature of his projects has led to many lawsuits from clients who were disappointed with the outcome of their homes. Because of this, Reynolds has a history of running into the law.

The film focuses on the issue of the low level of sustainability in humanity's modern way of living. Reynolds describes his feeling that all humans on earth are running as part of a herd, headed for the edge of a cliff. As part of the herd, Reynolds feels that it is necessary to affect others with a new consciousness of sustainability in order to save himself. The majority of Americans are dependent upon the government and outside resources such as plumbing and food controlled by corporate industries in order to survive. In the film, Reynolds asserts his belief that people in cities are not able to support themselves, which makes cities vulnerable to disaster. Reynolds presents his method of totally sustainable living in the form of Earthship houses as the necessary alternative.

While the film functions as a way of following the life of Michael Reynolds and uncovering the relevance and importance of his method of building and living, the lens from which the film is shot is rather biased. The story focuses mainly on his perspective and the perspective of those within his circle. However, a large portion of the film covers the political and economic obstructions he faces in continuing to build sustainably. The first opposing entity introduced into the film is Shauna Malloy, the attorney who first had legal dealings with Reynolds. According to Malloy, what Reynolds was doing fell ""out of the scope of what New Mexico considers legal construction,"" and according to traditional architecture, ""standard design is what is considered safe."" Reynolds is then interviewed with his response, admitting that he was ""breaking every rule in the book,"" and the problem, according to one of Reynolds crew members was the planners and politicians inability to see past the established mode of design and construction which allowed for little room for designing in unregulated ways.

A major argument in the movie is the incompatibility of modern law and politics with a process of quick evolution and progressive movement towards sustainability. Reynolds' attempt to design according to the governmental system resulted in him losing his freedom to immediately act upon an idea and in turn stifled the evolution of his designs. This led to Reynolds decision to infiltrate  the system, drafting a law to allow for experimental architecture in the name of sustainable growth. However, the Senators didn't understand the need for it, and one is quoted as having said ""America already has safe and affordable housing."" The entire film sheds a very negative light on American politics, showing slow images of politicians sleeping and moving slowly in order to emphasize the incompetence of the legal process.

The issue of the Western unsustainable lifestyle and rejection of the reality of climate change is magnified tenfold when Reynolds is called to the Andaman Islands in India post hurricane destruction. The film juxtaposes the closed-mindedness of America with the grateful reception of those who need his help most. The town benefits substantially from the Earthship designs, as it allows residents to control rainwater and control internal temperature with natural geothermal technology. Reynolds and his crew help rebuild the Andaman society from the ground up, and show local residents how to use local, low tech materials for building. The film shows how open people are after a disaster, and warns that the Western denial of environmental degradation is keeping necessary lifestyle shifts from occurring quickly.

While the film is shot from the perspective of Reynolds disbelief in the future of cities, few alternatives are presented for those currently living within urban systems. In the film cities are made out to be doomed, and yet for those who live in metropolitan regions, not many have the immediate ability to move to an Earthship. I would like to have heard Reynolds thoughts on how cities should go about making changes, as his radical thinking is very inspiring.

Overall, the film is an incredibly inspirational work that challenges the current mode of Western thinking and offers examples of those who are paving the way in using what is already available to shift to a more progressive consciousness. I was moved by the wisdom of Reynolds and those he works with from start to finish, and I now have an entirely new perspective into the state of housing and what it will take to transform our greatest necessity, home, into a system of self-sustenance.

3105571,5,B0013F60IW,Very interesting story about someone that is trying to to make fundamental changes to how we build houses. What interests me the most is how State legislators and bureaucrats tried to stop him and the lengthy battle that ensued to allow him to spend his own money exploring his ideas.,1394323200,,284,4.7
3105572,4,B0013F60IW,"Kudos to Reynolds for his major contribution: consolidating all the green architecture ideas into a single building design. Anyone who has subscribed to Mother Earth News or Grit has come across these same ideas many times in piecemeal form - although some of the green houses documented in these and other publications incorporate more than one ""green"" technology.  And it's not only hippies and subsistence farmers who live completely off the grid. Lots of ranchers, farmers, and other country folk have no access to organized utilities.

Sierra Club published a book back in 1975 called ""Other Homes and Garbage"" which describes many of the technical principles and data required for self-sufficient housing, so not much of this is really new, it just isn't very popular with tract house developers. They have to sell their houses to housewives who are more interested in impressing their peers than saving money or sustaining the environment. The wives are the people who set the styles and requirements; just watch HGTV ""House Hunters"" and notice how many want stainless steel appliances, granite counters, and crown molding.

There are also some obvious flaws in the green gospel. One is the idea that electricity gathered from the sun will be free.  Not so; the $ investment required is quite high just for solar panels alone (about $20K for a minimum 5KW system) and if you want to have electricity when the sun doesn't shine, count on quite a lot more for batteries and their maintenance/replacement. Septic systems (which I have in my own home) aren't cheap either, especially when the leach field needs to be replaced ($6000) and in areas with insufficient rainfall count on many more $$$ to dig, pump, and maintain a well. Growing all the food you need inside your house is not very practical either. Even if you are a strict vegetarian you would need lots more plants (and fruit/nut  trees?) than you can fit into one row along your front wall. If you want meat or eggs, count on adding a barn/henhouse and a pasture plus plenty of water for the animals, not to mention veterinary care. All of that expense is not chickenfeed (pun). There is good reason why humans banded together into communities with division of labor and money systems instead of barter.

That is not to say that Earthships are impractical, only that a well-built one isn't necessarily cheaper than a well-insulated stick-built house that appropriately uses those principles espoused by Reynolds which make economic sense in a particular situation.

As far as fighting City Hall goes, building departments can be sued if they failed to enforce code requirements when somebody gets hurt, and inspectors can lose their jobs. They are enforcers not engineers and don't have the time nor technical skills to evaluate new or unorthodox ideas. On top of that, lots of code requirements are written by employees of companies that make the products used in building construction and this builds a lot of inertia and complexity into the codes. The legislators who approve the codes are most often lawyers, and what do they know?

The movie is certainly worth viewing but don't get too evangelical about it.",1394236800,,3180,4.975517890772128

The Garbage Warrior

Why self-sustaining housing? Not only are self-sufficient homes, also known as autonomous homes, environmentally friendly but these recycled earth machines are known to save a stupendous amount on housing costs. Initially these green living dwellings began as a project for radical architect Michael Reynolds, from The Garbage Warrior filmed in 2008 and directed by Oliver Hodge. For thirty-five years Reynolds has been experimenting with sustainable housing in New Mexicos desert.  These homes are often built with cast-off materials, using recycled garbage such as old beer cans and used water bottles to create homes. Within the film The Garbage Warrior, Reynolds calls attention to issues within traditional modern architecture. This film creates an image for communities to unify the environment and architecture together. Homes Reynolds designed and created relied solely on themselves for heating, cooling, electricity, and more. As well as being beneficial infrastructures these homes are perceived as visions of art. Self-sustaining housing is important because many families cannot afford typical housing; Michael Reynolds brings attention to the importance of key issues in the environment utilizing it within urbanism in a creative, inexpensive way. Reynolds ultimately brings a twist to building.
 Not all American housing authorities have welcomed Reynolds work; many actually strived to shut his work down. These reasons varied for why authorities had wanted an end to self-sustainable housing. Some reasons include minor infractions of leaking or heating, or others insisting there had been issues not following all regulated laws for building. Many of New Mexicos authorities held animosity towards Reynolds work because it threatened traditional architecture. Aside from possible regulation breaches sustainable housing sheds thousands and thousands out of the picture, as Michael Reynolds expresses you couldn't care what it looked like, you just cared that it worked. These houses have much value to them for they save the environment as well as people. Reynolds argument of building a home to be effective at the lowest cost possible is reflective in his passion of creating a home with the people in mind, not of the appearance.
Sustainable housing may have its flaws but overall would be very beneficial if it were to be encouraged. Many areas, especially in third world countries should provide this type of building so families can actually afford living. Sustainable housing offers many perks such as self-sufficient lighting, heating, as well as including green houses so these homes provide food and water along with the apparent need for shelter. Reynolds homes are built throughout trial and error it is apparent that these homes will have minor problems but with permission to continue and expand sustainable housing these problems will be sorted out, ultimately creating safe living environments for the public. Michael Reynolds may come across as a radical energetic hippy but that is the exact person sustainable housing needs to campaign its growth.
Throughout the film, The Garbage Warrior, one could learn much about the struggles of a planner. Witnessing the struggle Reynolds challenges it has characterized the strictness of modern architecture well and the difficulty to change it. As Reynolds stresses various times,
People do want to see out of the book, but if they did theyd see a solution to these problems.
A solution to environmental and living issues cannot be found if one is unable to explore the possibilities. An interesting aspect of New Mexicos inability to work with experimental housing was surprising due to its history of allowing the atomic bomb to be tested within the state. It is peculiar the state could allow testing of bombs initially killing much land but not allowing the creation of self-sustaining housing communities due to concerns of it affecting the people? Taking risks for planners is not easy for many regulations are withheld on most of their ability to design. If regulations could be easily worked with planners and architects would be able to exercise the ability to change housing. With exploration of new housing outcomes homes will be built in a more affordable and efficient way.",1382486400,3,4341,5.40768094534712

3105576,5,B0013F60IW,"Mike shows a lot of determination and heart in doing something that is so taboo and seen as strange in a wealthy and supposedly developed country like America. His innovative homes are comfortable, off-the-grid, warm in winter with no heating, and cool in summer with no air conditioning. Why other developers aren't looking into this is because the system is about profit, and not well-being or the beauty of life. The power companies are greedy and don't want people living off the grid. They'd rather us all continue to be dependent on coal, oil, gas, resources so they can fill their pockets further. It's incredibly short-sighted, and exactly what Mike was trying to go up against...he wanted to get people thinking longer term, which will be needed increasingly in the future.

His team went and built an amazingly sustainable and tsunami-proof home in an area wiped out by the 2004 disaster. They didn't even need drinking wells (which were polluted with sea water and dead bodies) because the home was built to catch rainwater and store that in its own well...more than enough water in a place seemingly with no drinkable water.

These ideas need to get out for the betterment of humanity. Mike said that it seems like people only look at new ideas after a disaster. Maybe it will take one or more disasters in America for people to break out of their shortsighted stupor.",1294617600,3,1380,4.818565400843882

3105579,1,B0013F60IW,"As I watched this ""movie"" I found myself thinking, ""So this is where all the old hippies went."" (And just as foul-mouthed as ever). All the talk of ""global warming"" and the disclaimer at the end that ""all the carbon used in making this film was compensated for by planting some rainforest"") tells you right off what you're getting into. New Age/Eco-cultists rejoice! This is your film!

In this film we are shown all sorts of communal construction scenes of ugly hippie-type housing, like dugouts with appendages sticking out all over (windmills, water collectors, solar panels), interspersed with scenes of communal guitar-playing and group games with pretty hippie girls swinging awkwardly at balls and giggling when not cuddling their cute kids and singing. Utopia! (Well, maybe not quite utopia. Got to go tend to those solar batteries, and shovel some more compost).

The garbage hero tells us about how his houses collect all the water the occupants ever need from the sky (even in the desert of Taos, somehow) and tells us how there is no sewage going out either, without explaining how this is possible. Great if it works! But does it really work? Too many questions go unanswered. How do you purify the stagnant water you collect from the sky? How do you flush away human waste, which is a crowning achievement of civilization (the Minoans had the first flush toilets 3500 years ago)? What must it smell like in one of these ""self-sufficient"" houses? (I'm not sure I want to know). I have lived around sewage in third-world countries, and it is not pleasant. Who carts off the real garbage of daily life? (Apparently nobody, you just pile it up and live with it).

And why all the lawsuits from buyers of these houses, so many that fighting them cost this ""architect"" his license?

Another thing I kept asking myself as I watched this movie: where is all this money coming from? The ""warrior"" speaks casually of buying hundreds of acres of land to pursue his developments, and always seems to be driving a big new pickup truck while his crews use the latest power tools (OK, I'm jealous, my own pickup is 22 years old with 240,000 miles on it, and my tools are decades old).

I guess there is something in all of us that yearns for the simple life, away from the crowds and the traffic and the stress, with no utility bills to pay, and this film panders to that yearning, and makes it seem easily possible. But a close look at those dingy, run-down little shacks full of batteries and collectors of all sorts, along with the idea of having to account for every drop of water going in or out, and live with your own sewage, gives the lie to this sort of life. Like most things that seem to good to be true, it is.

We are civilized people, and civilization means that your basic needs can be taken care of and taken for granted, not obsessed over like these ""garbage"" people have to do. I set my propane furnace's thermostat and forget about it--I do not have to run acres of shades up and down on my solar windows trying to adjust the temperature. My well pump sees that when I open the tap, water comes out for drinking and cleaning, and my waste is flushed away at the touch of a lever. Our free-market (for now) society provides places to buy food, exchanging the profits of my work for the sustenance I need. I don't have to grow what I eat. With my basic needs thus taken care of, I can pursue higher things, not spend all my time just trying to subsist, like people did in Neolithic times, and in 3rd world countries today (and in these ""garbage houses""). That is civilization, and we're all in this together, not each hiding out in the desert with a guitar trying to make it entirely on our own.

And the language these people use, well, it reminded me of the things that repulsed me about the hippies when I went to college with them in the 1960's. These are still dirty people with dirty mouths, and if you look closely in the film at the interiors of some of their ""houses,"" they still live in the squalid clutter we saw in the communes of the day. Back then, they (and at one point in my youth even I) thought this made them ""authentic"" people. But I am grown up now, and I know that they were (and usually are) just sad, grungy, self-absorbed lowlifes, afraid to join civilization.

However, all that said, these house-building hippies can do great work with their ""garbage housing"" in devastated third-world countries where people have nothing better to live in, and that is where the ""garbage warrior's"" real contribution to humanity lies. So I will give the ""garbage warrior"" credit where it is due. (Now if he and his uncouth friends will just stay overseas, out of sight, and especially earshot. . . ).

This film documents his evolutionary journey from his first buildings in the New Mexico desert to his entrance into the legal arena facing an uphill battle to pass a bill that would allow architects the freedom to experiment with building designs in a controlled environment, to make mistakes & learn from them.  Michael presents a compelling case, both to stodgy legislators as well as the audience that this is not only a good idea but absolutely necessary.  The essence of his message is that we must redesign society (not just the building codes) to be able to adapt forcefully & gracefully to rapid change.  It's a story about unexpected obstacles and the power of an adaptable & persistent spirit in overcoming them.  The film takes us to India's Andaman Islands where Mr. Reynolds uses his unconventional building technique to rebuild a community devastated by tsunami and demonstrates how swift positive change can be when not hampered by ideological resistance and red tape.  The pacing & flow of the movie are perfect, the musical score is great as well, complimentary to the action & powerful without being overwhelming (or overdramatic).  It is even humorous at times like the ""romantic"" tune playing while Mike's newfound ally (a converted knight for his cause from within the system) works her way through a sea of resistant & skeptical senators to help try to get his bill passed.

Garbage Warrior will not give you the latest cutting edge information about sustainable design (though it certainly is a great primer), nor is it a full biography of Mr. Reynolds (though it covers the period of his life relevant to the film superbly) or of the ins, outs & tangents of the Earthship movement.

3340067,5,B0013F60IW,"Garbage warrior chronicles the story of Michael Reynolds, an eco-architect who left the traditional world of architecture in order to follow his dream of building homes that allow people to take care of themselves in a fully sustainable way. Although depicted by his wife as stubborn, unusual and one-track minded, dismissing Reynolds as an idyllic hippy is difficult after the focus shifts from Reynolds eccentric nature to his creations. Earthships are off-the-grid, 100% sustainable homes built out of what modern society throws away in abundance, such as bottles, cans and tires. While the initial idea may bring to mind images of garbage huts, the homes are beautifully crafted oases intended to provide everything the inhabitant needs for survival. The homes sit on 6,000 gallons of water from collected rainfall, have internalized sewage, grow food, and use no energy. Reynolds presents the homes from a very idealist perspective, speaking of creating tropical farm havens with abundant wildlife. While the idyllic representation may at first seem unrealistic, the film continues on to show how conceivable the self-sustainable concept of living actually is.
Throughout the film Reynolds hammers in the importance of trial and error in his process, as his bold endeavors are indeed experimental. In fact, the experimental nature of his projects has led to many lawsuits from clients who were disappointed with the outcome of their homes. Because of this, Reynolds has a history of running into the law.

The film focuses on the issue of the low level of sustainability in humanity's modern way of living. Reynolds describes his feeling that all humans on earth are running as part of a herd, headed for the edge of a cliff. As part of the herd, Reynolds feels that it is necessary to affect others with a new consciousness of sustainability in order to save himself. The majority of Americans are dependent upon the government and outside resources such as plumbing and food controlled by corporate industries in order to survive. In the film, Reynolds asserts his belief that people in cities are not able to support themselves, which makes cities vulnerable to disaster. Reynolds presents his method of totally sustainable living in the form of Earthship houses as the necessary alternative.

While the film functions as a way of following the life of Michael Reynolds and uncovering the relevance and importance of his method of building and living, the lens from which the film is shot is rather biased. The story focuses mainly on his perspective and the perspective of those within his circle. However, a large portion of the film covers the political and economic obstructions he faces in continuing to build sustainably. The first opposing entity introduced into the film is Shauna Malloy, the attorney who first had legal dealings with Reynolds. According to Malloy, what Reynolds was doing fell ""out of the scope of what New Mexico considers legal construction,"" and according to traditional architecture, ""standard design is what is considered safe."" Reynolds is then interviewed with his response, admitting that he was ""breaking every rule in the book,"" and the problem, according to one of Reynolds crew members was the planners and politicians inability to see past the established mode of design and construction which allowed for little room for designing in unregulated ways.

A major argument in the movie is the incompatibility of modern law and politics with a process of quick evolution and progressive movement towards sustainability. Reynolds' attempt to design according to the governmental system resulted in him losing his freedom to immediately act upon an idea and in turn stifled the evolution of his designs. This led to Reynolds decision to infiltrate  the system, drafting a law to allow for experimental architecture in the name of sustainable growth. However, the Senators didn't understand the need for it, and one is quoted as having said ""America already has safe and affordable housing."" The entire film sheds a very negative light on American politics, showing slow images of politicians sleeping and moving slowly in order to emphasize the incompetence of the legal process.

The issue of the Western unsustainable lifestyle and rejection of the reality of climate change is magnified tenfold when Reynolds is called to the Andaman Islands in India post hurricane destruction. The film juxtaposes the closed-mindedness of America with the grateful reception of those who need his help most. The town benefits substantially from the Earthship designs, as it allows residents to control rainwater and control internal temperature with natural geothermal technology. Reynolds and his crew help rebuild the Andaman society from the ground up, and show local residents how to use local, low tech materials for building. The film shows how open people are after a disaster, and warns that the Western denial of environmental degradation is keeping necessary lifestyle shifts from occurring quickly.

While the film is shot from the perspective of Reynolds disbelief in the future of cities, few alternatives are presented for those currently living within urban systems. In the film cities are made out to be doomed, and yet for those who live in metropolitan regions, not many have the immediate ability to move to an Earthship. I would like to have heard Reynolds thoughts on how cities should go about making changes, as his radical thinking is very inspiring.

Overall, the film is an incredibly inspirational work that challenges the current mode of Western thinking and offers examples of those who are paving the way in using what is already available to shift to a more progressive consciousness. I was moved by the wisdom of Reynolds and those he works with from start to finish, and I now have an entirely new perspective into the state of housing and what it will take to transform our greatest necessity, home, into a system of self-sustenance.

3340068,5,B0013F60IW,Very interesting story about someone that is trying to to make fundamental changes to how we build houses.

3340069,4,B0013F60IW,"Kudos to Reynolds for his major contribution: consolidating all the green architecture ideas into a single building design. Anyone who has subscribed to Mother Earth News or Grit has come across these same ideas many times in piecemeal form - although some of the green houses documented in these and other publications incorporate more than one ""green"" technology.  And it's not only hippies and subsistence farmers who live completely off the grid. Lots of ranchers, farmers, and other country folk have no access to organized utilities.

Sierra Club published a book back in 1975 called ""Other Homes and Garbage"" which describes many of the technical principles and data required for self-sufficient housing, so not much of this is really new, it just isn't very popular with tract house developers. They have to sell their houses to housewives who are more interested in impressing their peers than saving money or sustaining the environment. The wives are the people who set the styles and requirements; just watch HGTV ""House Hunters"" and notice how many want stainless steel appliances, granite counters, and crown molding.

There are also some obvious flaws in the green gospel. One is the idea that electricity gathered from the sun will be free.  Not so; the $ investment required is quite high just for solar panels alone (about $20K for a minimum 5KW system) and if you want to have electricity when the sun doesn't shine, count on quite a lot more for batteries and their maintenance/replacement. Septic systems (which I have in my own home) aren't cheap either, especially when the leach field needs to be replaced ($6000) and in areas with insufficient rainfall count on many more $$$ to dig, pump, and maintain a well. Growing all the food you need inside your house is not very practical either. Even if you are a strict vegetarian you would need lots more plants (and fruit/nut  trees?) than you can fit into one row along your front wall. If you want meat or eggs, count on adding a barn/henhouse and a pasture plus plenty of water for the animals, not to mention veterinary care. All of that expense is not chickenfeed (pun). There is good reason why humans banded together into communities with division of labor and money systems instead of barter.

That is not to say that Earthships are impractical, only that a well-built one isn't necessarily cheaper than a well-insulated stick-built house that appropriately uses those principles espoused by Reynolds which make economic sense in a particular situation.

As far as fighting City Hall goes, building departments can be sued if they failed to enforce code requirements when somebody gets hurt, and inspectors can lose their jobs. They are enforcers not engineers and don't have the time nor technical skills to evaluate new or unorthodox ideas. On top of that, lots of code requirements are written by employees of companies that make the products used in building construction and this builds a lot of inertia and complexity into the codes. The legislators who approve the codes are most often lawyers, and what do they know?

The movie is certainly worth viewing but don't get too evangelical about it.",1394236800,,3180,4.975517890772128

The Garbage Warrior

Why self-sustaining housing? Not only are self-sufficient homes, also known as autonomous homes, environmentally friendly but these recycled earth machines are known to save a stupendous amount on housing costs. Initially these green living dwellings began as a project for radical architect Michael Reynolds, from The Garbage Warrior filmed in 2008 and directed by Oliver Hodge. For thirty-five years Reynolds has been experimenting with sustainable housing in New Mexicos desert.  These homes are often built with cast-off materials, using recycled garbage such as old beer cans and used water bottles to create homes. Within the film The Garbage Warrior, Reynolds calls attention to issues within traditional modern architecture. This film creates an image for communities to unify the environment and architecture together. Homes Reynolds designed and created relied solely on themselves for heating, cooling, electricity, and more. As well as being beneficial infrastructures these homes are perceived as visions of art. Self-sustaining housing is important because many families cannot afford typical housing; Michael Reynolds brings attention to the importance of key issues in the environment utilizing it within urbanism in a creative, inexpensive way. Reynolds ultimately brings a twist to building.
 Not all American housing authorities have welcomed Reynolds work; many actually strived to shut his work down. These reasons varied for why authorities had wanted an end to self-sustainable housing. Some reasons include minor infractions of leaking or heating, or others insisting there had been issues not following all regulated laws for building. Many of New Mexicos authorities held animosity towards Reynolds work because it threatened traditional architecture. Aside from possible regulation breaches sustainable housing sheds thousands and thousands out of the picture, as Michael Reynolds expresses you couldn't care what it looked like, you just cared that it worked. These houses have much value to them for they save the environment as well as people. Reynolds argument of building a home to be effective at the lowest cost possible is reflective in his passion of creating a home with the people in mind, not of the appearance.
Sustainable housing may have its flaws but overall would be very beneficial if it were to be encouraged. Many areas, especially in third world countries should provide this type of building so families can actually afford living. Sustainable housing offers many perks such as self-sufficient lighting, heating, as well as including green houses so these homes provide food and water along with the apparent need for shelter. Reynolds homes are built throughout trial and error it is apparent that these homes will have minor problems but with permission to continue and expand sustainable housing these problems will be sorted out, ultimately creating safe living environments for the public. Michael Reynolds may come across as a radical energetic hippy but that is the exact person sustainable housing needs to campaign its growth.
Throughout the film, The Garbage Warrior, one could learn much about the struggles of a planner. Witnessing the struggle Reynolds challenges it has characterized the strictness of modern architecture well and the difficulty to change it. As Reynolds stresses various times,
People do want to see out of the book, but if they did theyd see a solution to these problems.
A solution to environmental and living issues cannot be found if one is unable to explore the possibilities. An interesting aspect of New Mexicos inability to work with experimental housing was surprising due to its history of allowing the atomic bomb to be tested within the state. It is peculiar the state could allow testing of bombs initially killing much land but not allowing the creation of self-sustaining housing communities due to concerns of it affecting the people? Taking risks for planners is not easy for many regulations are withheld on most of their ability to design. If regulations could be easily worked with planners and architects would be able to exercise the ability to change housing. With exploration of new housing outcomes homes will be built in a more affordable and efficient way.",1382486400,3,4341,5.40768094534712

3340073,5,B0013F60IW,"Mike shows a lot of determination and heart in doing something that is so taboo and seen as strange in a wealthy and supposedly developed country like America. His innovative homes are comfortable, off-the-grid, warm in winter with no heating, and cool in summer with no air conditioning. Why other developers aren't looking into this is because the system is about profit, and not well-being or the beauty of life. The power companies are greedy and don't want people living off the grid. They'd rather us all continue to be dependent on coal, oil, gas, resources so they can fill their pockets further. It's incredibly short-sighted, and exactly what Mike was trying to go up against...he wanted to get people thinking longer term, which will be needed increasingly in the future.

His team went and built an amazingly sustainable and tsunami-proof home in an area wiped out by the 2004 disaster. They didn't even need drinking wells (which were polluted with sea water and dead bodies) because the home was built to catch rainwater and store that in its own well...more than enough water in a place seemingly with no drinkable water.

These ideas need to get out for the betterment of humanity. Mike said that it seems like people only look at new ideas after a disaster. Maybe it will take one or more disasters in America for people to break out of their shortsighted stupor.",1294617600,3,1380,4.818565400843882

3340076,1,B0013F60IW,"As I watched this ""movie"" I found myself thinking, ""So this is where all the old hippies went."" (And just as foul-mouthed as ever). All the talk of ""global warming"" and the disclaimer at the end that ""all the carbon used in making this film was compensated for by planting some rainforest"") tells you right off what you're getting into. New Age/Eco-cultists rejoice! This is your film!

In this film we are shown all sorts of communal construction scenes of ugly hippie-type housing, like dugouts with appendages sticking out all over (windmills, water collectors, solar panels), interspersed with scenes of communal guitar-playing and group games with pretty hippie girls swinging awkwardly at balls and giggling when not cuddling their cute kids and singing. Utopia! (Well, maybe not quite utopia. Got to go tend to those solar batteries, and shovel some more compost).

The garbage hero tells us about how his houses collect all the water the occupants ever need from the sky (even in the desert of Taos, somehow) and tells us how there is no sewage going out either, without explaining how this is possible. Great if it works! But does it really work? Too many questions go unanswered. How do you purify the stagnant water you collect from the sky? How do you flush away human waste, which is a crowning achievement of civilization (the Minoans had the first flush toilets 3500 years ago)? What must it smell like in one of these ""self-sufficient"" houses? (I'm not sure I want to know). I have lived around sewage in third-world countries, and it is not pleasant. Who carts off the real garbage of daily life? (Apparently nobody, you just pile it up and live with it).

And why all the lawsuits from buyers of these houses, so many that fighting them cost this ""architect"" his license?

Another thing I kept asking myself as I watched this movie: where is all this money coming from? The ""warrior"" speaks casually of buying hundreds of acres of land to pursue his developments, and always seems to be driving a big new pickup truck while his crews use the latest power tools (OK, I'm jealous, my own pickup is 22 years old with 240,000 miles on it, and my tools are decades old).

I guess there is something in all of us that yearns for the simple life, away from the crowds and the traffic and the stress, with no utility bills to pay, and this film panders to that yearning, and makes it seem easily possible. But a close look at those dingy, run-down little shacks full of batteries and collectors of all sorts, along with the idea of having to account for every drop of water going in or out, and live with your own sewage, gives the lie to this sort of life. Like most things that seem to good to be true, it is.

We are civilized people, and civilization means that your basic needs can be taken care of and taken for granted, not obsessed over like these ""garbage"" people have to do. I set my propane furnace's thermostat and forget about it--I do not have to run acres of shades up and down on my solar windows trying to adjust the temperature. My well pump sees that when I open the tap, water comes out for drinking and cleaning, and my waste is flushed away at the touch of a lever. Our free-market (for now) society provides places to buy food, exchanging the profits of my work for the sustenance I need. I don't have to grow what I eat. With my basic needs thus taken care of, I can pursue higher things, not spend all my time just trying to subsist, like people did in Neolithic times, and in 3rd world countries today (and in these ""garbage houses""). That is civilization, and we're all in this together, not each hiding out in the desert with a guitar trying to make it entirely on our own.

And the language these people use, well, it reminded me of the things that repulsed me about the hippies when I went to college with them in the 1960's. These are still dirty people with dirty mouths, and if you look closely in the film at the interiors of some of their ""houses,"" they still live in the squalid clutter we saw in the communes of the day. Back then, they (and at one point in my youth even I) thought this made them ""authentic"" people. But I am grown up now, and I know that they were (and usually are) just sad, grungy, self-absorbed lowlifes, afraid to join civilization.

However, all that said, these house-building hippies can do great work with their ""garbage housing"" in devastated third-world countries where people have nothing better to live in, and that is where the ""garbage warrior's"" real contribution to humanity lies. So I will give the ""garbage warrior"" credit where it is due. (Now if he and his uncouth friends will just stay overseas, out of sight, and especially earshot. . . ).

8250584,3,B0013F60IW,"I have always hated waste and so the notion of ""Earthships"" is intriguing to me.  However this movie leaves some things to be desired.

It is difficult to watch this without being blood boiling angry at the injustice of ""authorities"" who abuse their power and squelch people who are trying to explore cheaper and better ways to build housing.  The folks in this community have some truly innovative ideas that deserve to be explored and perfected. I am convinced that we haven't even scratched the surface of what is possible in the area of sustainable off-grid living and in this day and age it is unconscionable that this kind of architecture is being suppressed by those who should be supporting it.

Having said that, I feel that this movie is very one-sided in the way it presents the story.  After watching this, I was thrilled with the amazing and simple ideas that seem to work so great, and there is truly some good ideas here.  I was so inspired that I looked further into the possibilities and found out that building homes from garbage has some inherent problems - not the least of which is that discarded tires are made of potentially toxic materials, and when used as the main matrix of a structure, they emit toxic gasses that can make people who live in these buildings very, very sick.  It might not be an issue for everyone, but it isn't a healthy environment for those who are sensitive.  And for people who are prone to cancer, it can be deadly.  Not to mention that many of these homes have failed to live up to their initial promise - some leaking, some too hot, some too cold and others that have been disappointing in a number of other ways.  Also, the low cost promise doesn't always pan out as expected.  When done right, these houses end up being as costly as their traditional counterparts - and being experimental, the potential loss if it doesn't work out is enormous.

So, on the one hand, there are ""powers-that-be"" who are committed to the status quo and might even have something to lose if better housing can be made more efficiently at a lower cost.  There is a huge architectural and building industry that will fight tooth and nail to protect their own special interests.  On the other hand these housing pioneers are creating buildings that are far  from proven for their long term structural viability and health implications.

I do wish we had freedom in this country to proceed with experimental projects like this.  The lack of it holds us back in a day and age when this kind of innovation is most needed.  However, as in all experimental projects, we need a balanced view and the ability to go into it with eyes wide open.",1460160000,2,2667,4.590717299578059

8250588,3,B0013F60IW,"Let me start by saying that this is by no means a criticism of Mike Reynolds, and the important and amazing work that he and his crew have done and continue to do both in the evolution of Earthships and in sane housing where it is needed most. I feel I should explain the three star rating. I first heard the word Earthship mentioned in an NPR piece with no description or explanation. I immediately Googled ""Earthship"" and within the hour had purchased Mike's three book set, here on Amazon, and had put Garbage Warrior at the top of my Netflix queue. The books and the documentary are excellent !!!!.Five stars with no hesitation. So here's the rub. I ordered the DVD only to find that it's a much abridged version of the documentary that I had previously seen, with much of the good stuff, and many of the interviews omitted. It's still a decent story, told well, but it lacked content that I really enjoyed and expected. Aside from the structures, Mike has also built a community, and an extended family, that are an important part of his legacy. Also missing was the technical content and  the sections on the electric and water system technology that they have developed, which is both important and fascinating. The year round production of food is understated in this version as well. Again, kudos to Mike and his team for their important contribution to saving this fragile and battered ecosystem that we lovingly call ""Mother Earth"". Please release the full documentary !! As a counter culture builder of ultra energy efficient dwellings, I would buy the revised full edition in a heartbeat to use as a learning tool for my crew.",1421366400,4,1639,4.690972222222222

Soon the county questions weather what he is doing is legal and if it works or not so he has to prove himself which does not go well. A big storm in India occurs and he is called upon with his expertise to build homes from the products he uses and helps the locals, inspiring. Later he helps in Mexico.

Then he takes his efforts to the state level in hopes of getting approval and again if is a difficult situation. Fear of the unknown. His plans sound crazy. Swearing throughout. Insightful.
