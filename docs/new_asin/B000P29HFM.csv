8188387,5,B000P29HFM,"As a library worker at an arts college, I found myself watching this the night it aired on PBS to keep up to date with the art world. Chuck is a great interviewee, first off, and secondly he's really funny. He had me laughing about his urge to sharpee an exhibition catalog or destroying his work. Some of the topics he touched on applies to multiple crafts: artist, musician, actor/actress, etc. such as knowing when to stop the art process and inspiration for his work. And I would say this interview is helpful for artists with disabilities or at least inspiring. Great interview, great artist, and Charlie Rose is always good at knowing when to pry and when to allow the interviewee to speak.",1177891200,,696,4.620967741935484
