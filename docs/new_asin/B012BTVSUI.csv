8725852,5,B012BTVSUI,"Helene Fischer Farbenspiel Die Stadion-Tournee (2015) has just been released on DVD. The show is excellent, but similar to Helene Fischer Farbenspiel Die Tournee (2014). Most of her hit songs are included in these shows. The Rose and Everything I Do are in sung in English in the 2015 show. A Party Medley is also included in this show, while the 2014 show featured a Rock Medley, Bring Me To Live, and My Heart Will Go On, all of which are sung in English. The aerial acts are different, Helene flies through the air on cables like a singing Peter Pan in the 2015 show and sings while flying on the back of Big Bird in the 2014 show.
 There is a third show on DVD, Farbenspiel Live Aus dem Deutschen Theater Munchen (2013), that I like better than these other shows since this show includes all of her songs from the hit album, Farbenspiel, as well as most of her older hit songs, which Helene sings with her band without the big show arena. However, everything is in German in this show. Unfortunately, all of these shows are recorded in only European PAL format, which doesnt work on US DVD Players with NTSC format. For me it was worth buying an all-region DVD player just to see Helene Fischer perform these shows.
I can also recommend her early shows on DVD, Mut Zum Gefuhl (2008), Zaubermond (2009), and Zum Ersten Mal (2011). The show in 2008 included The Power of Love, which is Helene Fischer most viewed song on UTube. All 3 shows include Russian Medleys and Broadway Medleys. If you cant find these DVDs in the US, you can buy them from Amazon in Germany.",1442534400,6,1567,4.45993031358885
