8416706,5,B0045I3EL0,This was a fun program and quite informative. The 3D effect was cool. The whole program isn't 3D so you only have to wear the glasses they give you when they tell you to.,1461283200,,170,4.029411764705882
8416707,1,B0045I3EL0,We turned it off within ten minutes. No real 3d effects and it came with glasses and we used our own. Would not recommend,1408752000,,121,4.083333333333333
