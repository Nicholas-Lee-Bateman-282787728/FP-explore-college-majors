Sadly this was the case of so many of the Christian movies many years ago.  Today, however, there are some great Christian movies such as The Case For Christ, The Shack, War Room , just to name a few.",1510531200,,370,4.411764705882353

His followers all sounded like they had been brainwashed.  This was a bad film, bad acting and horrible script.  This feels like it was produced to try and convince people that Jesus is the son of God.  It didn't work.  It was for lack of a more intelligent word. was just plain stupid.",1506470400,,413,4.311688311688312
8388528,5,B0034Q65Q0,"It's two years after the death; resurrection of Jesus Christ. The church is growing; the high priests are worried.

But what if the events of that day occurred, not in the first century, but in 1983? This compelling drama portrays the events that followed the death and resurrection of Jesus as if they happened in modern times. An attorney sets out to prove whether or not the resurrection was a hoax.",1338940800,2,402,4.661971830985915
