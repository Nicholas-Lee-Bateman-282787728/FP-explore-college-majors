8013651,5,B0001KCPFC,it was a good instructional video aimed at the serious combat oriented martial artist. most taiji materials are aimed at fitness or spiritual growth so this was exactly what the doctor ordered. very good teaching style and thorough demonstration.the clear teaching style and ample demonstration make for an excellent learning source that is never too weighty.it could have been longer without being overwhelming.,1171238400,3,412,5.555555555555555
8013652,5,B0001KCPFC,"This DVD serves as the animated companion to Rodell's Chinese Swordsmanship: the Yang Family Tradition. In it he goes through the applications for the eight basic cuts of taiji jian (t'ai chi double bladed straight sword), as they are manifested in different parts of the Michuan (Hidden Tradition) of Yang Family Taiji jian.
Rodell explains selected applications in the order that they appear in the form. He first gives a thorough, but not long winded, explanation of the important details of each application. The emphasis is upon allowing the demonstrations (filmed at a variety of different angles, at different speeds repeatedly) speak for themselves.
The critical message here is that the form and the applications go hand in hand, like yin and yang. To practice one and not the other is to nurture serious deficiencies in your art. Most students focus more on perfecting the form. The road to perfection lies in a thorough understanding of the applications. This DVD fills a critical lacuna in the libraries of taiji jian practitioners, who may have many on form, but little or nothing on application. To find a DVD that puts a ""why"" behind the ""how"" of a form is rare and much needed.
Because most wooden swords sold are rather flimsy for applications practice, viewer might be envious of the substantial wooden swords seen in the video. Fear not. One can contact Rodell through [...] to find out how to get one.
The DVD does not go through each and every application of the form. To do so would be, as Rodell says, ""Mind numbing."" We can only hope for a sequel.",1080086400,16,1571,4.800738007380073
8013653,5,B0001KCPFC,"This is an essential companion to Mr. Rodell's excellent book, CHINESE SWORDSMANSHIP:  THE YANG FAMILY TAIJI JIAN TRADITION.  Newcomers to the system, and those with a general interest in martial arts, can see how the graceful movements in the form are actually of great utility in the context of actual combat.  Advanced students will find this DVD an indispensible part of keeping their technique ""on track"".  The various applications are covered sequentially as they appear in the sections of the Michuan form, and each is repeated several times, at slow to fast speed, and is filmed from different angles (including from above).  Students should have no trouble following the movements and learning their correct execution.",1080086400,10,727,5.28695652173913
