8661907,3,B00KVOBZC2,"Although I liked the staging in general there were a few problems that almost ruin this whole performance ....for example Sachs making love to Eva during the overture making him look like a lecherous old man....and then the totally crazy ending of the 3rd act which I simply did not understand. What was the stage director was trying to convey? NO idea.  Sacca is a wonderful Whalter,  but the rest of the cast did not impress me. And I liked the tempi of Daniele Gatti.",1498435200,,470,4.517647058823529
8661908,3,B00KVOBZC2,"This is Wagners opera of real people - even some real historical figures - set in a real place, so whats the point of the Lilliputian staging and the introduction of the Grimms characters?  It seems to me that the director went too far in his interpretation. It doesnt add much to the opera itself, and in some places it distracts and disturbs.  I respect Herheim for his staged concept, which is certainly an elaborate one and extensively explained in the insert, but I wasn't convinced that it was needed or that it added any dimension to the opera.  The Riot Scene at the end of Act 2, is particularly troublesome.  It is a dreaded scene for any stage director, but I found this one a total flop.  The quintet in Act 3 failed to create the musical effect intended due to the interference of the staging. A static situation would have been much better. After all, this is an opera, where the music should be the focus; the quintet is so marvelous composed that any distraction is a detriment to it.
It is refreshing, though, to see (relatively) young singers that can move on stage. It gives credibility to their roles. This time, however, too much of it didn't serve any purpose.
The audio recording also suffers, at some points, from uneven voice volume.
This production is not my preferred one.",1498176000,,1299,4.581896551724138
8661909,4,B00KVOBZC2,"Like David McVicar's production for the 2011 Glyndebourne Festival (Opus Arte), Stefan Herheim's for the 2013 Salzburg Festival opts for a Biedermeier-period update. The two productions otherwise have little in common. This time, a year is specified, 1833, when Wagner would have been 20 years old, a young adult close enough to his childhood to retain clear memories of childhood things. I think that that bit of information is pertinent in the production's imagery of toys and fairy tales, its playful tone, as well as in the larger concept. The protagonist, the widower Hans Sachs, is an ordering Wagner figure. We see him jolted awake with an inspiration in the prelude, then furiously writing at his desk, noticing the audience, pulling a curtain closed, finally overjoyed to have (so he thinks) completed his labors by the end of the prelude. He becomes both creator and participant in the human comedy, and there are suggestions at times that the tale is turning out in ways he had not foreseen. We may make a connection to Walther's Prize Song, which begins as a dream but fully flowers only with hard work and the improvisation of the moment. Not everything in Herheim's MEISTERSINGER comes off (I could have done without, for example, the Masters being literally blown off their stools by their first encounter with Walther's singing, and then undulating on the floor as he continues). But it is fresh, freewheeling, and far smarter than its occasional missteps. It has a lot to say about imagination, dreams, and the role they both play in the creation of art. In that sense, it strikes me as more in the right spirit of MEISTERSINGER than some of the mustier video choices (Bayreuth 1999, Met 2001).

While Glyndebourne's tone was more settled and sober; Salzburg's veers unpredictably between realism and surrealism, the serious and the silly. When you watch Glyndebourne, you pretty much know what's coming, and you hope the familiar scenes to come are going to play in such a richly satisfying way as what you've already seen. When you watch Salzburg, you don't know what's coming, and it has a bit of magic-show excitement about it. Herheim does overdo the whimsy in places. This is a staging I think could still go through modification and editing on its way to the Met (general manager Peter Gelb scooped it up quickly for a future season). I am not sure Herheim has carried all of his ideas through to the fullest. The first two acts present the characters as miniatures, the whole first act on a set that is a large-scale replica of the writing desk of the Sachs we saw waking in the prelude. The second act moves away from the writing desk, but continues the ""miniatures in Sachs's home"" idea, with Magdalena-as-Eva atop a chest of drawers, letting down a long braid to Beckmesser, Rapunzel style. In both of those acts, Sachs's books (Des Knaben Wunderhorn and Grimm Fairy Tales, also large-scale models) release fantastic objects and creatures which mingle with the characters. But then a long stretch at the beginning of Act III becomes nearly a standard, realistic MEISTERSINGER, the bold experiments with scenic scale having petered out (there is a marvelous coup de thtre at the eventual scene change). Herheim obviously loves the work, and he knows his German culture and gets smart allusions in. Unlike some of his peers in Regietheater, he also is not averse to eye candy. This is an enchantingly beautiful production to look at, purely at the levels of set, costume, and lighting design, and it has been well filmed.

Where the endeavor suffers most is in the casting of the young lovers, Walther and Eva. There is a noticeable dip in audience enthusiasm when those singers take the stage in the final ovations, and one sees why. Anna Gabler, who also sang Eva in the Glyndebourne production, is a lovely woman, convincing in the period and even looking like a fairy-tale princess, though she was more flatteringly dressed and coiffed in the earlier performance. Unfortunately, what just barely worked vocally in the intimate confines of Glyndebourne is a bridge too far in the Groes Festspielhaus. She squeaks and huffs her way through so much glorious music, and by the time her important line in the quintet comes around, she labors to sustain it. Her consort, tenor Roberto Sacc, is a good singer limited by an unremarkable and worn instrument. He knows just what to do in terms of shaping the music, but what comes out is dry and wobbly, and he does not look much younger than the Sachs. These days, the ""B"" couple tends to be luckier in casting, as here: Monika Bohinec's Magdalena gets some great reaction shots, and the David (Peter Sonn) is an adroit comedian and a fine singer, doing the traditional eager-boy shtick without making it precious or grating.

The unusually young, preeningly handsome Beckmesser of Markus Werba is star-making stuff. When his music steadies up for the serenades, you hear truly beautiful singing, and he commands the stage. Herheim overdirects the Beckmesser/Sachs confrontation in Act III (Beckmesser actually physically assaults Sachs, none too convincingly), but Werba invests it with the malicious authority of a raging Alberich. He also figures in something of a surprise ending, which made it clearer to me why such a young baritone was cast. It makes perfect sense that Werba/Beckmesser gets the next-to-last singer bow. Michael Volle is not a vocally suave and mellifluous Sachs in the line from Schorr to Finley -- Volle's delivery is frequently gruff and biting -- but he manages to bring out *all* the sides of Sachs, not just the kindness, intelligence and philosophical leanings, although those too. This time one believes the talk of Sachs's temper, of his apprentice fearing his blows. He is the very picture of an ordinary man of a bygone time (either the 16th or the 19th century), more enlightened than most, barely keeping a lid on rising irritation at the provincial attitudes around him. Herheim makes good use of this ability to convey anger, and the ""Wahn!"" monologue finds Volle working himself into quite a lather. Georg Zeppenfeld's Pogner makes you look forward to every line and regret there are not more of them. He has a strong presence too, lean and graceful. There have been more arresting and inspired accounts of the score, but Maestro Daniele Gatti accompanies lovingly, and it is hard to resist the sound his idiomatic Viennese forces make in this music.

This does not displace Glyndeboune as my first choice for a MEISTERSINGER DVD. McVicar's is less ambitious than Herheim's as a directorial capital-S ""statement"" on the work, but it is also more polished, better worked out, and the direction on the human level is of great delicacy. Perhaps Glyndebourne is for the heart and Salzburg for the brain. Both are strongly recommended and likely to repeat well, the Glyndebourne because favorite moments will satisfy again and again, the Salzburg because there is a lot to take in on the first try. The Salzburg should be seen on the largest screen possible, by the way. I had a hard time mentally hooking into it in the first couple of attempts on a portable player, but on a large TV, it went by like a flash. Herheim is a still-young director who tends to swing for the fences, and his is a career worth following. I can imagine some operagoers sitting through this production as if in the marker's box, loudly chalking down the faults (""Wrong period! That isn't in the libretto! She's not supposed to be on stage!""). I think that that would be a mistake, because Herheim's talent and his insight are equivalent to his daring. The bird has a well-formed beak.

A bonus feature provides a long look (about 15 minutes) at one of Herheim's information-packed piano rehearsals. Only Herheim and Volle are interviewed. The latter is greatly impressed with the former's intelligence and creative energy, and talks of the challenging but rewarding experience of the production.",1438128000,6,7979,4.911786508524833
8661910,2,B00KVOBZC2,"What is wrong with operatic directors these days? It is as though they are so jealous of the composer they must make every effort to kill the work. They can't make singers sing poorly. They can't mess with the music or the delivery of the orchestra. But they can certainly screw up the intent, story and feelings conveyed by the music drama.

Audiences must start demanding better of these people who Jonas Kaufmann was quoted as saying ""work out their childhood problems through their productions rather than paying to see a therapist."" There is room for interpretation but isn't the idea to convey what the what composer had in mind? Wagner didn't just supply a score. He gives production notes and stage direction. He had concepts and ideas in mind. Good grief.

So what's the problem with a fairy tale look? Arguably, that could be played acceptably. It could even be charming. But this opera doesn't begin in the church as written, it begins with a completely fabricated scene. Is that acceptable? When the munchkins turn to dry-humping each other at the end of Act 2, I could hardly go on.

I regret buying this DVD because I've contributed to someone thinking they did something of value. Rubbish.

If it's that bad, why 2 stars? Could not bring myself to penalize the singers and the orchestra. They are stuck with the director's mess.",1423180800,11,1343,4.75107296137339
8661911,3,B00KVOBZC2,"As of 2015 there are over 12 DVDs of DMVN. Enjoyed each of the several I purchased including this one. But there are things that are puzzling and disturbing. Never before in an opera or a movie have I ever seen a woman having an orgasm at a church service. But, at the end of the overture, Hans Sachs pulls back a sheer curtain which reveals the congregation in worship and an invisible Sachs appears to touch Eva and she gets really happy. At the same time Walther shows up, so who provoked this paradoxlym of pleasure? Outside of the Marquis de Sade, no one would dare explore this area. And what is it with all the toys and dolls, Meistersingers in Toy Land? The girls from Furth were huge porcelain dolls with dancers inside who arrived in a train pulled by a steam locomotive which wasn't invented until a few hundred years later. And there are busts on the stage of Wagner and Beethoven who were born centuries later. Time travel should be the purview of science fiction, not opera. I also didn't appreciate Eva sticking her tongue out at me. None of these quirks prevented me from enjoying the performance but they certainly didn't add anything.

Even for Wagner, DMVN at 5 hours is an endurance contest. Rarely do I have 5 hours for anything so I normally go for the highlights which, for me, are the overture, the first scene in Saint Catherines Church, and the final scene, the Feast Day of Saint John which is one of the greatest scenes in opera. Afraid I agree with Rossini who said, more or less, Wagner is 5 minutes of sheer genius interspersed between half hours of tedium. Or in the vernacular of today, Wagner has moments to die for and moments where you wish you were dead. I realize that this sacrilege makes me a low brow, an uncouth country bumpkin, and an obtuse klutz but Im just not interested in devouring liver and eggplant to get to the chocolate cake.

On the METs old Opera Quiz one of the most frequent guests was Father Owen Lee who said that DMVN is the greatest of all the operas. Dont know if Id go that far but it has the best final scene in all of opera, ranking right up there with the Grand March from Aida and the Coronation Scene from Boris Godunov. No matter what kind of mood I am in it lifts my spirits. And considering my grim nature thats hard to do. If you just have to have all the DMVNs get this one along with all the others. But, if you can afford only one, go for the Glyneborne if, like me, you value pageantry over nuance. It has a stage filled with enthusiastic supers, stilt walkers, jugglers, under aged drinkers, real Girls from Furth, and a Hans Sachs who is far too dignified a gentleman to fondle women in public. Be sure to watch the final scene; its the most fun you will ever have with your clothes on.",1422316800,7,2765,4.3565891472868215
8661912,2,B00KVOBZC2,"The idea of having the characters of Wagner's ""Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg"" Lilliputian-sized, cavorting across Hans Sach's desktop and amongst his furnishings (as if creatures out of his imagination), is a cute one; although what ""cute"" has to do with this particular opera is beyond me.  It's a fairly benign, inoffensive conceit (as Euro-trashy conceits go), until the Grimm's fairytale creatures appear and proceed to have anal intercourse with one another (I kid you not), turning the end of Act II into a nightmarish bacchanalia.  That's when I grabbed the remote, shut the thing off and walked away.  Seriously, why bother at that point?  I'm not averse to high concept (Chereau's Ring, Girard's recent ""Parsifal""), and I'm sure that director Stefan Herheim has justifications for his interpretation, but this one is so distracting as to be comical.  Too bad, as the cast, particularly the Sachs of Michael Volle, is first rate.  Call me a boring traditionalist, but I would much rather watch a respectful production, like David McVicar's rapturous Glyndebourne version, than a non-sensical mess like this.",1420070400,14,1116,5.27683615819209
8661913,5,B00KVOBZC2,"I had already ordered the Glyndebourne Meistersinger and then saw this listed on presto I decided it would be an interesting contrast as I have heard good things about it and was disappointed I could not get to see it. I have now seen them both and I'll speak on this one first. This is a reasonably traditional production with an important addition. The Director Stefan Herheim (as he discusses in a bonus feature at the end of the second disc) incorporates characters from the Grimm Brothers fairytales has additional stage characters in the drama. Standing back up at Die Meistersinger is basically a German fairytale, but one that's taken very seriously. Many of the characters in the opera have close cousins in the fairytales. Herheim without changing one word but maybe relaxing things just a bit allows us to see an entirely new concept of this up and it's characters. I respect him greatly for that.
Before the opening is a short pantomime section where we see Hans Sachs waking in the middle of the night and rushing to his desk to write down a new song. Has already lost his first family and stop for a moment to grieve his wife and lift the covers off some of his late children's toys. Traditional productions rarely address that vulnerability. As the overture begins he draws a scrim across the stage that is first still lets us see is home but gradually begins changing to focus in on his desk the center of his life now.
A larger version of the desk becomes the church of the first act and the area between his home and Pogner's for the second act.
There already is a fair amount of magic hinted at in the original, when Beckmesser ""finds"" the poem, at the attempted elopement, in the Festival,  and here the director provides a little smoke for some atmosphere, but the actions are always included within the scope of Wagner's music, and are entirely in keeping with the music. I never saw these facets before.
At times the costumes may be tweaked to slightly suggest a certain fairytale but the director is very wise and not making any direct allusions. As we are reminded with Chinese Japanese and Korean being the first three choices for subtitles this is an international production and each country has their own folklore.
The standout of the production was Michael Volle, the Sachs, who I've seen in several other productions and who is simply perfect here: commanding, vulnerable, tender, funny and a great baritone. He can show the intelligence of a Fischer-Dieskau in one phrase with a full dramatic range in the next moment. Roberto Sacca is the Walther in fine voice, on the mature side, but the Glyndebourne Walther seems only a raw teenager beside him. The Eva, Anna Gabler, is in both productions, seen better here.  Beckmesser, Markus Werba, is here younger, better voiced, more human and a more creditable competitor for Eva's hand than usual. I will be on the lookout for more from all of these singers including the David, Peter Sonn, who also did a great job.
I have several Meistersingers on laserdisc and enjoyed them for many years (still do) but it's really exciting to see these new singers who will have careers that will far outlive me. At the same time, there are great CDs of singers from the past where I can still hear the 78 of the quintet ""Selig wie die Sonne"" I grew up hearing that I still prefer over the one in this production. It's on ""German Vocal Ensembles"" and ""L'Introuvables du Chant Wagnerien"" with many other gems.
The orchestra is the Vienna Philharmonic under Gatti and the 5.1 sound is flawless save for a bit of roughness in the principle mens' voices when they sing loudly (both stereo and 5.1). i've already contacted Euroarts and await their response. I'll update when i hear; in the meanwhile, pointing speakers away a bit seems to lessen it.
All in all this Meistersinger is an absolute winner and an essential despite the small issue with sound. I have enjoyed the Glyndebourne  production but it seems very much closer to the ones I've enjoyed for the past 30 years on video.
I am not a paid reviewer - I ordered this as soon as I saw it listed at presto.",1411257600,24,4126,4.641586867305062
