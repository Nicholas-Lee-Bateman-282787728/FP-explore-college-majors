1924393,4,B0000DG055,"I just love the performances from this DVD.  Such great quality too!  I just really wish this didn't have such a minimalist aspect.  I would've really liked some scenery and much more than a blackdrop.  And the chorus just stood there the whole time and did nothing.  But Fleming just broke my heart.  She understands Manon as well as any Manon ever will.  And I really love those Fleming high notes.  She hits a high D at least three times and I think one high Eb -- all just greatly! Alvarez has the best high D's I've ever heard.  He is one of the finest tenors of this generation, if not the best.  Jean-Luc Chaignaud (Lescaut) was really quite animated and good!  This role really suits him.

The whole production was just really really well-acted and well-sung.  Not complaints as far as the talent was concerned.  But I'm telling you, a good set would have added soooo much more.

If I want to see the best Manon since Beverly Sills (a great vidoe is out of that by the way!!), buy this.  Fleming is Sills' successor in this role.",1096156800,8,1037,4.407407407407407
1924394,5,B0000DG055,"Quite an extraordinary, moving and affecting production.  A remarkable accomplishment by Renee Fleming, who is ravashing and captivating in the role, perhaps like no other since Sills.  Alvarez is a solid partner, with supporting roles all more than adequately handled.  The Paris Opera orchestra is superb under Lopez-Cobos.  The magnificent period costumes are all lovely, and wonderfully accented by a rather minimalistic, but effective, stage setting.  Special kudos to both the stage and video director for bringing a special focus and clarity to key scenes.  Technical aspects are all superb.  Highly recommended.",1093478400,9,619,5.663043478260869
1924395,5,B0000DG055,This is one great Performance.  All the performers are really on their BEST and Fleming & Alvarez are matched perfectly. The sets are a little thin but the costumes are very colorful & fit beautifully for this Manon performance. Buy it - You will love it. ED B.,1087257600,4,261,4.4375
1924396,5,B0000DG055,"There are certain operas like, say, Verdi's ""Don Carlo"" or ""Il Trovatore,"" that are true ensemble pieces.  It requires gutsy singing from several principals and yet, if say the mezzo or the tenor is a tad on the weak side, there is still enough otherwise to make the performance enjoyable.  And then there are opera's like Massenet's ""Manon,"" which places high singing and acting demands on just two singers, and boy do they have a hell of a lot to sing!
It's for this reason, I think, that ""Manon"" isn't performed quite as often.  It falls completely flat without an excellent soprano and tenor.  Sure, there is some singing for the baritone and bass, but nobody sees this opera for them.  This is the soprano and tenors show!
Having said that, this production, taped in Paris just two years ago, is excellent!  Renee Fleming is definitely hit-or-miss with many of the roles she selects these days, but here she is right on the money.  In fact, this is some of her finest singing I have heard.  Her affinity for the role is obvious  and she is thoroughly convincing as an actress.  Fleming's physical beauty and excellent facial expressions certainly help in making her Manon a true, dangerous beauty.
I've never been a huge fan of tenor Marcelo Alvarez. While his voice is pleasant, I find him to be rather underwhelming.  I was pleasantly surprised here, though.  In this performance, he sings with more passion and fire than I have ever heard him sing.
If only he could work on his stage presence!  Clearly not an actor, Alvarez struts around the stage looking rather goofy and clumsy at all times.  His costume in the first acts, doesnt't help much! (he looks like he has a neckbrace on!).  All in all though, hs performance is terrific and while I'd much prefer Alagna or Marcello Giordani in this role, Alvarez comes through and definitely thrills.
The supporting cast is good, particularly Vernhes as Des Grieux's father and Jesus Lopez-Cobos' conducting is solid.
The production is stark and the stage is barren, but it works, particularly in the last scene when the only bit of scenery present is a lone star in the sky.
The only down side to this DVD is trying to find it!  As I write this review, Amazon and all it's sellers have none in stock.  I was lucky to find it at a store nearby.  It seems to have gone out-of-print a mere two weeks after it released.  This is quite a shame, because this is a great DVD for an opera lover.",1068249600,29,2443,4.587557603686636
1924397,5,B0000DG055,"Renee Fleming is at her very best, and I rank this DVD in the top ten of Operas that all lovers of this venue should own.  Now, if the Met will just release her other recent works, we can enjoy the Fleming talents to the full.",1067299200,4,226,3.9130434782608696
1924398,4,B0000DG055,"Let me preface this review with the statement that I have not one of Renee Fleming's biggest fans.  I mean I do own a few of her albums but I have not thought of her as one of history's most important sopranos.  I have also been turned off, at times, by the publicity machine that has been driving her career, but there relatively few recordings of Manon and even fewer videos.  So when I saw this DVD in Tower Records, I at first hesitated but took a chance and bought it.  It turns out that my decision has been handsomely rewarded.
The first thing that struck this viewer was the gorgeous photography and costumes.  Visually this is one of the most beautiful productions of any opera I have seen.  The staging is rather on the sparse side but that adds to the presence of the fine costumes which frequently arrest the viewers' attention.
Renee Fleming is surprising good in this roll.  I have been used to recordings of the past featuring Feraldy and Sills, both of which have voices that are lighter and seemingly higher than  Fleming's Manon.  But I have now begun to appreciate the fuller voice of Fleming to that of a Sills, for instance.  Her acting, one might say from operas I have previously seen her in, has been somewhat muted.  But in Manon she seems to really get into the part.  She also seems to take more chances vocally, reaching some unexpected (and perhaps a little tedious) high notes.  Along with Emma Luart and Germaine Feraldy ,  Fleming is now among my favorite of Manon's.
Marcelo Alvarez is, unfortunately, miscast in this role.  His very Italianate portrayal is a disappointment to me, although the French audience is kind.  His use of aspirates and sobs is frequently disturbing and his French accent needs work.  Nor does he appear to be comfortable on stage in this role - a little awkward and clunky I would say.  The interaction between his character and Manon is not entirely believable.
The other roles are all finely sung and acted notably Jean-Luc Chaignaud as Lescaut and a fine comedic touch by Michel Senechal as Guillot de Morfontaine.  .
One point of the DVD production needs to be mentioned.  It appears that the soundtrack on the first disk is not synchronized exactly in time with the video.  It does at times make one think that voices were dubbed in afterwards.  This is somewhat surprising given the quality of the rest of the production.  This small flaw would not stop me from highly recommending its purchase.",1066867200,9,2461,4.645833333333333
1924399,5,B0000DG055,"This DVD comes from a June 2001 performance at the Opra National National de Paris/Opra Bastille and stars Rene Fleming as Manon and Marcelo lvarez as des Grieux.

Fleming says that Manon is one of her favorite roles, and I can believe it. She invests the character with a good deal of feeling, and although she seems a little old and not quite giddy enough to be playing the simple school-girl in Act I, she gets better and better as the action proceeds. Her singing, of course, is nonpareil. Indeed, for me the action doesn't really catch fire until the final scene of Act II (although 'Nous vivrons  Paris,' in Act I, is exciting and beautifully sung by the young lovers) when Manon contemplates giving up des Grieux and letting him return to his family, in 'Adieu, notre petite table,' followed by des Grieux's 'En fermant les yeux,' sung gorgeously by lvarez.

The staging triumphs in the two 'public' scenes--the Cours la Reine scene (Act III, 1) and the gambling scene at the Hotel Transylvanie (Act IV). Each of these scenes is so full of visual stimulation that it might even be easy to miss the main action except for the expert television direction of Franois Roussilon.  The baroque-style ballet (choreography by Ana Yepes, and occurring in the Cours la Reine scene) is an engaging use of the music--a larger group of formal dancers alternating with a trio of solo dancers, each movement fitting Massenet's expert pastiche of 18th-century music perfectly.

The scene (III,1) between the hero's father, Comte des Grieux (sung sympathetically by Alain Vernhes) and Manon is touching and sets up the reconciliation (III, 2) at St. Sulpice between the new Abb des Grieux (whose 'Ah, fuyez douce image' brings tears to one's eyes) and Manon. If only they could have known that being in love and managing one's money often don't go together! The final act when des Grieux is gotten off by his father from charges of cheating but Manon is found guilty and about to be deported is heartbreaking, and again Fleming and lvarez outdo themselves.

Lescaut is sung and acted effectively by Jean-Luc Chaignaud, de Brtigny by Franck Ferrari. It was wonderful to see the venerable Michel Snchal as the old rou, Guillot de Morfontaine; the old rascal can still act up a storm.

The spectacularly talented Jsus Lopez-Cobos led the musical forces brilliantly. I imagine symphony patrons in Cincinnati still mourn his departure from their city. Sets and costumes, brilliantly effective and richly sumptuous, are by William Orlandi. The inventive staging is by Gilbert Deflo.

I will not forget any of the wonderful recorded Manons I've treasured over the years. My first was Janine Micheau in an otherwise dreadful recording from the 50s. I've more recently come to value the 1929 Opra-Comique recording with Germaine Fraldy (Manon) and Joseph Rogatchewsky (des Grieux), conducted by Elie Cohen. And the still wonderful recording with Beverly Sills and Nicolai Gedda. I missed the one with Alfredo Kraus and Ileana Cotrubas, but more recently liked, although a little less, the Italianate 'Manon' with Gheorghiu and Alagna.

Do not hesitate. This will be the 'Manon' to have for, I expect, years to come. It captures one of Rene Fleming's signature roles and shows off one of our rising tenors, Marcelo lvarez, in a marvelous performance.

1924400,5,B0000DG055,"[This release of a 2001 Paris Opra production was originally issued on TDK in 2003. It was wonderful then and it's still wonderful. The following is my 2003 review of the earlier issue, with a couple of additions.]

So far this is the only 'Manon' to make it to DVD. [Since I wrote this there have been releases with Netrebko/Villazn and Gruberova/Araiza.] But you really don't have to wait for a better one to come along; it will likely be the one to have for a long time.

1924401,4,B0000DG055,"And a very satisfying one too!

Massenet's music is sublime; the satin-voiced Renee Fleming portrays a charming Manon and Marcelo Alvarez, a convincing Des Grieux (although no one can live up to my childhood memories of seeing the great Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayao and Giuseppe Di Stefano in the leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera). The highlight for me was Alvarez's heart-breaking rendition of ""Ah, fuyez, douce image!"" as Des Grieux waits to take his vows at Saint Sulpice. The red-haired Fleming is stunning in the title role, but she presents such a picture of health that I had to suspend my disbelief when she is supposed to be dying on the rode to Le Havre. This is partly the fault of the costumer, who dressed her in shiny peacock blue satin (supposed to be the tattered remnants left over from the Hotel de Transylvanie, when she was arrested; because of its sheen, the costume doesn't look quite tattered enough.).

For the most part, William Orlandi's costumes are reminiscent of a Watteau or Fragonard painting, and I suppose it was excusable to conceive the scenes at Cours la Reine in commedia dell'arte Venetian costumes a la Tiepolo. However, I disliked Orlandi's use of scarlet, a color that seems not only anachronistic for a woman in the early 18th century but also rather obvious on a symbolic level, especially when Manon doffs her black domino in Saint Sulpice (One would think that Des Grieux might think twice about leaving the church for such a patently scarlet woman!). I also think that that blue is not the most effective choice of color for a woman who is obsessed with gold in the gambling scene (I recall Sayao wearing gold watered silk reminiscent of the gown worn by Mme. de la Pompadour in Francois Boucher's portrait.). Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to see a production that utilizes traditional costumes instead of ""modern"" representations that turn up in some productions (One thinks of the flannel nightgowns and pillows for the water nymphs in ""Roussalka""!).

The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Alain Vernhes in what can be the thankless role of the Count Des Grieux, and Michel Senechal as the old roue Guillot de Mortfontaine.

Despite the above reservations, this production is on the whole excellent, and the ending left my cheeks wet with tears.",1215475200,4,2310,4.915384615384616
1924402,4,B0000DG055,"Pour Rene Fleming, il s'agissait sans doute d'un ""challenge"" : chanter Manon, en Franais of course, et  l'Opra de Paris! Challenge russi...qui pourrait rsister  l'une des plus belles femmes au monde, don't la voix irradie et enchante?
Curieusement, Manon est devenue la coqueluche des grandes maisons d'opra, et les chanteuses d'aujourd'hui (Dessay et Netrebko, entre autres) aiment se l'approprier. C'est trs bien, car l'opra possde beaucoup plus de charmes que sa rivale puccinienne, trop brutale  mon got.
La production franaise se veut plus intimiste qu' Vienne ou Barcelone, avec de beaux cadrages qui se resserrent ou s'largissent, comme des plans cinmatographiques, voquant aussi bien Watteau que Choderlos de Laclos (les liaisons dangereuses). Les costumes sont absolument magnifiques. Mention spciale au vtran Michel Snchal, acteur, comdien et chanteur, qui sait ce que thtre veut dire...

Her impeccable French phrasing is a joy to behold. Marcelo Alvarez is a wonderful singer. The costumes and set are perfect. Not too outlandish or overdone. Sound and picture quality are excellent. The camera people did an outstanding job of filming this live show. The audience is clearly appreciative of what they witnessed that evening. Highly recommended.",1175040000,4,501,5.3544303797468356

1924405,5,B0000DG055,"The first time I saw this performance was actually on the big screen for it was a part of an opera-festival in Vienna. My memories weren't deceiving me here. Not since the days of de los Angeles (Still a fave) have I been as enchanted with a Manon. Renee Fleming portrays both the innocent girl as well as the corrupted seductress perfectly. Her voice is like a sensual perfume, gorgeous, warm and bursting with colours and emnotions. (I don't get much of Manon's corruption & cunning from de los Angeles, Freni or Cotrubas. Sills on the other hand manages a balance of supreme artistry but her voice is less luxurious than Fleming's) Manon is not an innocent with a pretty sweet voice, Manon is first of all a weak, greedy & seductive woman. (Her innocence is soon gone) & Fleming portrays that with luxurious colours, wonderful FRench diction (de los Angeles & Vallin beat her there though) and exquisite pacing. Her costumes are GORGEOUS & fittingly garish (For a courtesan) as is her make-up. I also love that she's not stick-thin but has womanly curves, in the 18th century they preferred women like that btw.

Alvarez is even better when it comes to the French style, yet his acting (Vocal & physical) is a bit wooden, maybe on purpose, 'cause the role ain't a seducer. He's brilliant in the church-scene, exquisite in the final scene where he phrases emotionally & sings with a gorgeous timbre that so fits des Grieux's nature.

The production is lovely, no Euro-Trash anywhere. Lopez Cobos, a veteran, conducts with fire & style, the rest of the cast is great as well. A must buy for Fleming fans & beyond.",1148515200,11,1614,4.679577464788732
1924406,5,B0000DG055,"This is an amazingly beautiful production in a not-at-all attractive opera house! Manon is simply another role that the great Renee Fleming owns, and everyone else in the cast is breathtaking as well! Along with the recording, this DVD is just stunning!

1924407,2,B0000DG055,"This Manon looks beautiful and I enjoyed watching the great costumes and scenery, but I was very disappointed with the singers. Marcelo Alvarez has good high notes but this does not seem to be a good role for him. Renee Fleming sings beautifully in places, but her vocal mannerisms are very apparent, there are slurps, swooning, and very fussy delivery. Also, she does not look convincing as a young girl in the first act, and looks very frumpy in the Adieu aria. Her acting is servicable, she seems to be relying on her glamour instead, but I admit I was more impressed by her gowns than her performance. Hopefully there will be a new DVD of Manon, possibly with Vargas and one of the French sopranos like Dessay.",1132444800,6,714,4.5859375
1924408,2,B0000DG055,"This production has a lot going for it - the sets are gorgeous in their elegant simplicity and the costumes are beautiful. Also the appearance of authentically French singers in the smallers roles (including the incomparable Michel Senechal) adds a lot. Alvarez is really very good, singing with a beautiful line and feeling for the music - I miss that last bit of elegance the role calls for.

However for me the whole sinks due to the singing of Renee Fleming. The basic quality of the voice is beautiful but so much is affected and tricky - constant bulges in the line - and she lets final notes of phrases sag in pitch. Moffo does the same in the infamous Thais she recorded but with Moffo you felt she had to sing that way due to lack of support. I don't know what Flemings reasons are but singing like this, which would be bad in any repertory, is particularly damaging in French where you need a straight and simple line. Some parts are better than others but the whole Cours la Reine feeds into her worse mannerisms and its frankly awful. Listen to Maggie Teyte if you want know how to sing French properly and even Sills at the end of her career sang French better than Fleming.

One only hopes she can get herself in hand and correct these problems before its too late.",1130630400,18,1279,4.438297872340425

8000865,3,B0000DG055,"There are a lot of compelling aspects of this production of Massenet's Manon -- and I'd ""grown up"" since my teens with the gorgeous New York City Opera production of October 1977 with Beverly Stills, Henry Price, and Samuel Ramey as a terrific Comte Des Grieux, to compare the 2001 Paris performance with (I have to ask for the thousandth time to any dvd manufacturers out there, WHY is the 1977 NYC Manon still only on VHS and never got to dvd?).

First, the bad to get out of the way:  what in blue blazes is with that masked Harlequin woman in the Cours-la-Reine scene with her mouth perpetually wide open?  WIDE open.  Not grinning or smiling, just GAPING in the silent phony laugh of an old-time movie lunatic.  Honestly, that piece of stage business is downright scary and I don't know whether a director bullied her into it or she thought it'd be cute to do that herself.  But it's horribly distracting and all one sees when ""O Rosalinde"" is being sung. I can't wait until she's off the stage, the Gavotte is sung, Manon ""feels out"" Daddy Des Grieux, and then the wonderful ballet commences.

Now about that Gavotte.  What spoils that, and much of Renee Fleming's singing in this performance of the opera -- and I think she has a sublime, truly beautiful voice, rich and voluptuous and full of feeling -- is that affectation in this performance of swooping and scooping her notes.  What was she trying to do, create a new interpretation of Manon?  If so, it fails sadly.  I admire the Fleming voice for many reasons and really, when she's not sliding those notes, her vocal timbre makes her Manon comes across alluringly as a sly, knowing, full-grown-for-16-years-old girl in the first act, one whom we would BELIEVE would already understand all about boys and how to wind men around her little finger, instead of the giggling flirty naif whom even the sublime artiste Beverly Sills was juuuuust a tad self-conscious playing.  But the minute Fleming scoops and slides into her first solo arriving from the stage coach, the listener wonders, ""What's she trying to do?  Sound arch?""  It just doesn't come off.  When she just forgets the kitty-cat meowing and straightforwardly sings, she is fabulous. The Hotel Transylvanie scene is magnificent.

The roue' Guillot just sounded like an old man -- fun as an actor, and an adept idea to put him in late 1600's wigs to show how out of date the old dopper is -- but nothing at all impressive in his voice; other Guillots act hilariously AND sing well, both on record and video.

I have no complaints about either Des Grieux, fils or pere, but the NYC guys gave them more character -- Henry Price put across the wistful teenage boy and looked it, and as before mentioned, nothing beat Samuel Ramey's gorgeous vocal portrayal.

I loved the costumes; they were loyal to the 1720's setting of the Prevost novel, richly colored and appropriately panniered.  The scenery could have been more decorative -- it was too sparse and blank and the revolving stage lent a creepy amusement park aspect to some of the action.  The Pousette, Rosette and Gavotte were among the best I've heard (I have all the complete studio recordings between 1923 and 1982) and it was charming to use the Leloir illustrations for the opening credits in this dvd set.  This is the one set of the Massenet Manon video to own, along with the Sills VHS, and completely eschew the ""modernized"" productions -- the recent Met one setting the action in circa 1900 stank -- and their unreliable singing performances.",1381017600,,3527,4.702439024390244

8000868,1,B0000DG055,"I bought this DVD because my favorite recording of Manon (Angela Gheorghiu & Roberto Alagna) is available on CD only and I wanted to see the opera. All in all, I can't say I want to watch this production again - I should have rented instead of buying. I like Fleming in Mozart and Strauss, but her vocal portrayal of Manon was artificial, mannered, over-worked. It fell flat. It felt like she was trying to demonstrate to a student how to sing Manon instead of actually inhabit the character. It felt like ""Oh look at me and see how great I am""!",1356393600,,545,4.352941176470588

All in all, I can't say I want to watch this production again - I should have rented instead of buying.

8000870,5,B0000DG055,"Renee Fleming is a great singer and in this production a great actress. She conveys just the right proportions of flightiness, sophistication and adolescent nervousness. I recently saw the Metropolitan Opera production of Manon, with Anna Netrebko, and the Fleming production is much better - including the singing, the acting, the sets. I have seen Renee Fleming in numerous operas and though she is always good, this is surely one of her best performances. A very enjoyable show.",1344297600,,481,5.17948717948718
8000871,5,B0000DG055,"This DVD is my first viewing/hearing of this opera and can't understand how I have missed it all these years.  It is ""my new favorite opera"".  The music, the singing, the acting, the staging, the costumes, the lighting and the directing are all perfect.

I was surprised to see only one other review of this production here on Amazon.com, and wanted to encourage anyone hesitating to get this on that account to go for it.  You will not be disappointed.",1318896000,2,453,4.625
