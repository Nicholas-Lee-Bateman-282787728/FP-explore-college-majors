7076371,5,B00V4603E2,5 Stars hands down!! Not only is this video a great length (under 30 minutes) but it's very enjoyable to watch and follow along. So many great tips and advice throughout! Highly recommend it!,1430697600,,191,4.647058823529412
7076372,5,B00V4603E2,"Very practical information on how to use an adaptable sleep routine. My wife and I are preparing for our first little one, and have been looking into a variety of books on the subject.  Got this video instead and are very pleased.",1430611200,2,230,4.476190476190476
7076373,5,B00V4603E2,"A gentle guide for creating a flexible routine for your little one in his or her first year of life. This DVD gives practical steps in helping establish healthy habits that lead to better, more restful sleep for your baby and for you! We used this routine with our daughter and we will use it for our next child, and any child after that!",1430438400,2,338,4.296875
7076374,5,B00V4603E2,"Received this as a gift from friends and could not be more thankful we watched this prior to baby's arrival. We will post an update once we're a few weeks in with our first newborn, but here's what we loved about the video so far (prior to putting it in action):

1. Easy to watch! Laura Kang comes across as super helpful (and totally non judgmental) as she efficiently outlines what you need to know in order to create healthy sleep habits. Love her tone and her knowledgeable approach. So easy to listen to!

2. I love that the video gets to the point, outlines bullet points, and is thorough without being drawn out or long winded. Totally my style of learning!

3. Love the content of the video itself! While I was aware of the Eat, Wake, Sleep routine, this is something so many tired parents need to hear. I can't believe some parents aren't able to get their children to sleep through the night until 2 years of age! We're hoping with this routine, and sticking to our guns about sleep props that we learned from the video will help make sure we are able to be well-rested!

HIGHLY recommend this video and the concepts behind it! So worth it!",1431475200,,1151,4.415094339622642
7076375,5,B00V4603E2,"A total game changer. If you're a frustrated parent, exhausted and sleep deprived...this may possibly be the game changing process to help you find some of that critical rest you've been missing out on since baby came. The process really works and you'll love how easy this is to watch/listen to while you learn it. I can't recommend Baby It's Bedtime more, you're gonna thank me later.",1431216000,,386,4.776119402985074
7076376,5,B00V4603E2,We had a difficult time as first time parents. We were so happy with the results we got using this system. Highly recommend.,1431129600,,124,4.434782608695652
7076377,5,B00V4603E2,Sleep deprived?  What a great resource to get new parents back on a routine and hope for a full nights rest!,1431043200,,108,4.142857142857143
7076378,5,B00V4603E2,"This is such a wonderful tool for new parents. Definitely a ""must"" before your first lil' one arrives or as helpful advice to better your lifestyle as an existing parent. This video has helped my wife and I to pre-plan a routine that will add consistency in our daily routine and ADD value to our relationship with the addition of our first child. Every parent has personal advice to offer us in regards to our new baby, BUT never is there a clear action plan on how to address the difficulties associated with raising a child (especially during infancy). This video has established links of importance between feeding, sleeping, and interaction with your baby. TWO THUMBS UP! #pumpedparents",1430870400,,691,4.864406779661017
7076379,5,B00V4603E2,so good!,1430784000,,8,3.5
7076380,5,B00V4603E2,This is such a great resource for parents! It also makes a wonderful shower gift! I'm buying copies for all my friends who are having babies!,1430784000,,141,4.461538461538462
7076381,5,B00V4603E2,"I love how beautifully produced this is-- so refreshing after all of the lame 90's videos we had to watch from the hospital! Everything about this feels right and DOABLE! I like that it's realistic and relies on knowing your baby (because I hate feeling like I'm trying to force something with my baby) and helping to gently structure the day in a way that really makes life feel sane again! Though we did not end up ""dream feeding"", we did use a lot of the principles in Baby It's Bedtime, and our happy girl has been sleeping and napping well since 4 months and seems to really love her routine! I highly recommend this as a resource to new parents who need hope that SLEEP IS POSSIBLE!",1430697600,,688,4.3828125
7076382,5,B00V4603E2,We all know friends and family with newborns and it's painfully obvious that sleep to them is more valuable than gold! Baby It's Bedtime has great content and production value with easy steps for implementation. A+ in my book.,1430697600,,226,4.82051282051282
7076383,5,B00V4603E2,"We are in the season of life where all of our friends are having babies!  We are so excited to share about Baby it's Bedtime because it really works!  Simple to follow and easy to understand, you will be glad you got Baby it's Bedtime!!",1430697600,,236,4.222222222222222
8709056,5,B00V4603E2,"In this short video, Laura Kang approaches the importance of a daily routine for babies in a practical concise simple manner. With easy to remember acronyms and charts, this routine will be easy for any mom to follow most days, from 2 months old through the first year of a baby's life. The first several months of motherhood can be exhausting and frustrating while establishing a workable pattern. By partnering with BIB, I believe it's possible for moms/parents and babies to thrive through babyhood. I will be gifting this video at friends baby showers, as well as recommending this video's methods to my clients struggling with their baby's sleep patterns (or lack thereof). BIB is worth the purchase! Take the challenge!

8709057,5,B00V4603E2,"Helpful guidance for getting a routine in place, during a time of so much newness. Worth the watch!!!",1432598400,,101,4.666666666666667
8709058,5,B00V4603E2,"This video is a life saver! I wanted our baby to be on a flexible schedule and this video and BIB routine is the perfect baby training solution. Between the tips, routine ideas and and ways to get your baby the most effective sleep, it was 20 minutes full of nuggets! It got our guy sleeping through the night and on a predictable enough schedule for me plan my days and work. It also includes a suggested schedule for the day with BIB which is so helpful when getting started. Plus it's relatable and so well produced, which is a fresh take from all the 80s videos we watched in our birthing class! Thankful to have put my overwhelming stack of baby books away for this more than helpful 20 minute video that I could start immediately!",1432252800,,736,4.37956204379562
8709059,5,B00V4603E2,It was a really helpful video that my wife and I watched together.  So much easier than reading all those books out there.  Laura did an awesome job of breaking down the day to get my baby Sophia on a flexible routine :)  Lots of info...,1432166400,,237,4.108695652173913
8709060,5,B00V4603E2,"Forget the multiple books about sleep training (which I bought after our first baby), this video is all you'll need.  I wish this DVD was available 4 years ago when my son was born.  It is informative yet they make it simple to learn everything you'll need to know to get your baby sleeping through the night.  You won't regret buying this DVD.",1431907200,,344,4.428571428571429
8709061,5,B00V4603E2,"This is something that can be helpful for ANY mother. I've heard for years now, ""there's no book on how to be a parent"". No, but there are things like this to help guide you. It's detailed, helpful, practical and a great way to set up a schedule for ANY baby. It gives great advice on time management. My husband and I are able to effectively plan out our days so both my baby and I can get the sleep we need! If you're planning to have a baby, have a baby or know someone who's having a baby this is something you should definitely purchase. The perfect baby shower gift!",1431734400,,572,4.162162162162162
8709062,5,B00V4603E2,"I bought this DVD to help me out with a routine for my second child.  I had success getting my first child on a routine using The Baby Whisperer methods, but I wanted a quick refresher for my second child without reading the book again.  Baby It's Bedtime has created a similar method but presents it in a fraction of the time.  Much needed for this busy mama!  The information in the DVD is presented in a straightforward but interesting way.  Laura is easy to relate to as you listen to her talk about setting the routine for her own kids.  I highly recommend this DVD to all parents desiring to get your babies on a routine.",1431561600,,627,4.316239316239316
8709063,5,B00V4603E2,This is so helpful to new moms.  Laura is a trained professional and a mom.  She understands what a new mom feels and the questions that go on every day.  The video is clear and full of wisdom on the needs of your baby.  I have given it as a gift a few times.  Everyone has been helped and thankful for the advice.  You won't be disappointed .,1431475200,,343,3.9705882352941178
8709064,5,B00V4603E2,"Having a newborn myself, sleep is probably the most important thing for my baby and me. I remember driving my older daughter to school and thinking to myself, ""I shouldn't even be driving, Im so tired."" It was then that I realized I needed help with ""sleep training"" my baby. After reading blogs and talking with friends I found this DVD. What I love about it is that it is short and to the point. Who has time to read when they have a newborn? Not me. Im trying to take care of the rest of my family and there is no time for anything leisurely. I am just surviving over here. This method is my favorite because it is training me how to help my baby. He is currently now a few months old and sleeping!!!!! The BIB acronym is easy to remember and I can't wait to see if there is going to be any other releases from this company.

Bottom line: Buy it if you want sleep!!!",1431475200,,869,4.1117647058823525
