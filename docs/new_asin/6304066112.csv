769085,5,6304066112,"This is a really good resource for the ultimate Q fan.  The box set contains all the Q episodes of The Next Generation featuring Q, barring the pilot episode and the final episode, All Good Things. The set contains the Hide and Q episode from the first season, Q Who from the second season (the episode which truly converted me to becoming a Next Generation fan), the hilarious Deja Q from the third series, Q-Pid from the fourth series, and finally True Q and the thought provoking Tapestry from the sixth season.
I find this collection really useful when I want to undergo a ""Q-fest"" as I don't have to plough through my other next generation tapes when I want to watch just the Q episodes.
This collection features 4 tapes, unlike the UK edition which I have which is restricted to 3.  So I wonder what's on the last tape?  Maybe an interview with John De Lancie???  Who knows.",992736000,3,880,4.48125

7860292,5,6304066112,I love DS9 but could not afford the price of the other version.  I got this and it was wonderful.  All DVDs are fine. They have gone where no man has gone before !!! Enjoy :),1328227200,,174,3.8055555555555554
7860293,1,6304066112,"""The Chosen Collection"" is a Hong Kong bootleg.  These collections have been marketed as ""imports,"" but Paramount has never authorized any third parties to publish Star Trek.let alone on region 0 DVD-5s like this.",1315699200,7,213,5.264705882352941
7860294,5,6304066112,I also don't know why anyone would give this box set a poor rating. I fould the box to me more sturdy than the domestic version (my friend has the domestic version). My import version has all the same episodes and extras. The play back and sound quality is excellent. And I saved a LOT of money! I think this set rocks!,1236729600,,319,4.161290322580645
7860295,5,6304066112,"I don't know why other people are giving this a bad rating. I didn't have any problems with the quality of my picture or audio. I think it is expected that the picture quality might be a little less than regular dvd's because this was made for tv and back in the 1980's. I did notice though that as the seasons go on the quality gets better and better as one might expect if they watched these when they were on tv. The audio was good and for the most part in Dolby Digital. I liked the fact that each disc was numbered and in sleeves to make it easier to find the next disc. That's the reason I bought this collection because so many others had given the more expensive versions bad ratings because the discs were not labeled well and the discs came in flimsy trays.

I think this is a great collection to get and an amazing price! Now I am ready to move on to another Star Trek Series. Thanks!",1233446400,2,895,4.14367816091954
7860296,1,6304066112,"After viewing only two episodes, I agree with C Bailey's first customer review. Skin tones suddenly have a ghastly green tinge but relax folks it isn't your television set; it is the digital transfer to dvd. If you can get beyond that the box itself looks nice. There is no booklet or episode breakdown other than what is on each individual dvd. The discs themselves are numbered and have which season you are viewing on each of the 48 discs. Going online and printing out an episode breakdown might be helpful if you wish to locate a special telecast. This set is half the price of the official release but the picture quality is poor at best.",1227484800,3,644,4.512820512820513
7860297,4,6304066112,"I've been a big fan of the Borg ever since I first caught their assault on the Federation in the `Best of Both Worlds' cliffhanger, where our beloved chrome-dome is taken prisoner & turned into one of the enemy. These two shows are included in this set, along with the second-season gem `Q-Who?', where the 24th century's most mischievous all-powerful entity makes formal introductions between the antagonists. And let's not forget `I Borg', where the Enterprise crew rescues a single Borg survivor, and moral dilemmas start popping up left & right regarding their visitor. These four eppies are among the best that NextGen ever offered, and paved the way for further Borg hijinks in the 'First Contact' ' movie and the last several seasons of the starship Voyager's return trip.

Although this set showcases the best of NextGen's borg eppies, there're a few other shows relating to the NextGen heroes' most relentless foes that I also recommend you take a look at: the first-season finale `The Neutral Zone', `Family' (which is an immediate follow-up to `The Best of Both Worlds'), and of course the `First Contact' feature film. Catch these along with the box set shows, and I'm pretty sure you'll agree that when it comes to being a Borg aficionado, resistance is indeed futile!

7860298,5,6304066112,"The reviewer below gave titles included in the UK edition....but this US set is very different!  It has 4 tapes, and DOES include the very first STNG episode, ""Encounter at Farpoint.""  It also has ""Hide & 'Q'"" (episode 11)....""Q Who?"" (episode 42)....and ""Deja Q"" (episode 61). There's also a wonderful message to fans from John de Lancie, who plays Q, telling how he got the part!  A great collection in a cool box.",993772800,6,416,4.671232876712328
