4545685,5,B0053O89KG,"This unusually serious episode is a marvel of character revelation.  In this intense moment of personal crisis that touches everyone we've come to love, their deepest emotions are ripped to the surface and exposed.  An absolutely crucial development in the overall story arc, the trust between Castle and Beckett that has been growing so painfully slowly literally bursts forth under the life-and-death pressure in ""Cops and Robbers"".  Complex and surprising, uncomfortable and intimate, touching and hopeful, this is - and will always be - one of the most certain ""must owns"" for me!",1323216000,2,584,5.258064516129032
4545686,5,B0053O89KG,"After Killshot, you would think the Castle writers would take it down a notch. Instead they give us a solid episode starting with Castle and Beckett waking up handcuffed on a mattress in a dark and dirty basement. As the couple tries to recreate their memories so they can escape from their captivity, the B line story has Ryan and Esposito discussing the pre-wedding hoops (tests) Ryan is about to endure. The A story with Castle and Beckett mirrors the relationship give and take that Ryan and Esposito discuss. This episode kept me guessing until the end as to why the murder victim ended up face down in a dirty motel room. The criminals gave me chills. And Captain Gates gets high marks for getting the info she needed to get her people back.",1323129600,4,747,4.582089552238806
4545687,5,B0053O89KG,"I love Castle that's all there is to it! There isn't a bad episode out there! This one was more on the serious side, which is nice here and there. I love the PTSD issues Kate is dealing with and her frustration that she just can't ""get over it"". Well played! Espisito was really good in this one too!",1322870400,,300,4.101694915254237
4545688,5,B0053O89KG,"This episode is full of surprises, twists and turns.  It will have you on the edge of your seat if you have been following Becket's quest to find her mother's assassin and at the same time deal with her demons.  Stana Katic expands the role of detective Becket in a masterful, fearless emmy worthy performance.  Its truly ground breaking television. Superb acting, chemistry and writing missing from many tired detective shows on television today. The casting remains impeccable.
Don't miss this one.",1322611200,2,500,5.073170731707317
4545689,5,B0053O89KG,"After the last episode, I was worried. Worried that the writing was going downhill. Well that is surely not the case, as this gem was beautifully crafted from the script to the acting to the production, with some very effective techniques used to illustrate Kate's PTSD symptoms. This episode picked up the ""Kate was shot"" thread again, and joined up neatly with the sniper terrorizing the city. Can't say anything negative about it, and the evidence locker scene with Javi was particularly spot on. Nice climax with Javi as well, having Kate's back doing his snipery thing. Very little humor here, but the episode didn't suffer for it -- it was appropriate. Captain, sir [sic], you weren't even too annoying. And c'mon, who doesn't love Michael Dorn?",1321920000,3,751,4.921259842519685
4545690,5,B0053O89KG,"Did you notice the elevator scene in this latest (Oct 17, 2011) episode? The team is loaded for bear, all SWAT and everything, in the elevator headed up. The setup of that scene and sequence was intentionally meant as a production treat for the viewers. The cast and crew of TV Shows, TV Series especially, love to insert things that the fans enjoy, seeing them as jokes that they hope we will laugh at, along with them, in my opinion. That elevator scene is just such a scene. I laughed my guts outs. Replay it and watch for it if you were grabbing a handful of popcorn when that short few seconds passed you buy. They put that in intentionally for us. It had to be. It is so fun to communicate with the production group in such a way, letting us in on the inside jokes. I would not be surprised if Fillion was behind it. That would be his style, in, ""real life"", as they say.",1319414400,,877,4.226190476190476
4545691,5,B0053O89KG,"If you like comedies and enjoy crime dramas, you'll love Castle!

In season 4, Rick Castle and Detective Beckett are back to kickin' butts and takin' names! Nathan Fillion just nails it as Rick Castle, a smooth-talking, best-selling murder mystery writer who has negotiated a deal with NYC's mayor to ""shadow"" Detective Kate Beckett, who is portrayed by the lovely and talented Stana Katic. Molly Quinn reprises her role as Castle's adorable, ambitious daughter, Alexis. She is a breath of fresh air and steals every scene she's in. Susan Sullivan is perfect as Castle's live-in mother, a theater actress of yore with the wisdom of many years of experience.

And then there's the whole gang at the precinct... Loads of personality!

Let's just say... it's my favorite hour of TV every week! A little heart + a little humor + a dash of mystery = a whole lotta fun! A different network coined the phrase, but this really IS ""Must-See TV""!",1318032000,14,936,4.801242236024844
4545692,5,B0053O89KG,"This episode just flat-out left my husband and I speechless.  The emotional depths of the characters exposed in this normally lighthearted series was an endearing revelation.

Would that I could give it more than a puny 5 stars...",1317168000,7,383,5.129032258064516

4545694,5,B0053O89KG,I thoroughly enjoyed this light hearted grisly murder investigation.  There were lots of twists and romantic banter.  I'm glad the new Richard Castle Comic was featured as I recently bought that too from Amazon.  I enjoyed the costumes.  The new chief is rather funny.  I like her better than the old chief.

4545910,5,B0053O89KG,"I got hooked on this show a few months ago. Kind of goofy, but still a good crime drama with romantic tension in the air. What more can you ask?

I tend to be a TV snob, watching mostly documentaries and movies that have some artistic or social quality. That doesn't mean I'm too good for some basic, fun to watch entertainment, and this does the job. Castle's character is a successful millionaire, but just goofy and vulnerable enough, plus ok looking but not over the top good looking to keep him from seeming somewhat believable. Beckett's character is so good looking, confident, and successful that it's hard to imagine her ever seeing anything in Castle, but the chemistry is undeniable and they use that to tease the viewer into coming back episode after episode and season after season.

The plots are, for the most part, original and refreshing, but far enough from reality that you have to just go along and stop reminding yourself that these things would never happen in real life and that nobody would survive the predicaments that confront the characters on each episode. I am former law enforcement and know that none of the things on this should would ever happen, but again ... I don't care. Sometimes you just need to escape reality for an hour or two.

One of the real surprises for me has been Susan Sullivan. After watching her as the uptight Kitty Montgomery on Dharma and Greg, I couldn't have imagined her playing any other character. In Castle, she plays Martha - Castles whacky mother, who is an over-the-top, past her prime actress, with a multitude of character flaws, but who is nonetheless lovable.",1470873600,3,1628,4.725352112676056

Beckett endures an emotional roller-coaster as she deals with being shot, and with her growing feelings for Castle. Just when you think it's going to be over, surprises appear over the arc of the entire season. We start to see maturity in both main characters, and the story arc reaches a happy conclusion.

4546190,5,B0053O89KG,"I was reluctant to start watching yet another show. I'm up to date season-wise on several other shows, all of which are quite popular and average 4.5/5 stars consistently. I saw this show I'd never heard of called ""Castle"" and it consistently got 5/5 stars with over 1000 reviews!?! I had to at least put it in my wish list to ponder. It stayed there for about a year. I was caught up watching my other shows (NCIS (the one with Gibbs), Criminal Minds, GRIMM, Hawaii 5-0, Bones, The Closer (before it ended), House (before it ended), CSI: NY (before it ended), Rizolli and Isles, and Major Crimes), so I finally decided to give Castle a try. WOW! So far all 4 seasons are funny, have great action, the show's main storyline is a new idea, it's been cast VERY WELL, and the acting is GREAT. However, the thing I think is the greatest about it is the WRITING!! How they are able to come up with such great story ideas so consistently is amazing! All the other shows have excellent writing as well, but I can usually figure out ""who did it"" or how it's going to end about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through. Not in Castle. I have been wrong about 95% of the time to the point where I've almost given up trying, but that doesn't take away from the viewing experience ... it adds to it! These reviews often have spoilers, but I'm not gonna do that because I don't need to. I'll just say this is one helluva GREAT show that you should consider, but start FROM THE BEGINNING (Season 1) as it is best seen in order. I hope the writers of Castle are able to stay this creative for several more years.",1446163200,2,1586,4.2724252491694354

And while season 4 was a bit more dramatic than we'd seen before, I still find it a great season of the show.

As usual, this season starts with the aftermath of the season three finale.  While Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) is recovering from the shot that almost killed her (come on, did you really think she was going to die in the season 3 cliffhanger?), she tells author Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) to stop shadowing her to allow her to recover.  What she doesn't tell him is that she remembers everything from when she was shot, including his declaration of love.  Meanwhile, Castle is holding a secret of his own, a pack he's made with a mystery man to keep Beckett away from working on her mother's murder in order to keep the sniper from going after her a second time.

When Castle does come back to the precinct, he finds a new captain in charge.  Victoria Gates (Penny Johnson Jerald) is much more by the book than Montgomery ever was, and she barely tolerates having Castle advising the 12th precinct as much as he does.

But all this is background.  The show is still mainly about solving the case of the week with some quips and a laugh or two along the way.  Over the course of the season, a vigilante comic hero comes to life and starts killing people.  Castle and Beckett wake up cuffed together in a room with little memory of how they got there.  In a fun episode, Castle sets out to solve a decades old murder, with the cast taking part in the 1940 set flashbacks.  The February sweeps two parter brings Castle's old female CIA contact back into his life (guest star Jennifer Beals).  They solve a murder set on the set of ""A Night of Death,"" an obvious send up of their lead in Dancing with the Stars.  A serial killer dresses his victims like famous storybook characters.  And there's even a case with a zombie killer.  As you can see, there is plenty of fun to be had.

What about the supporting cast?  Well, Detective Esposito (Jon Huertas) and medical examiner Lanie (Tamala Jones) continue to give their relationship a try while Detective Ryan (Seamus Deaver) ties the knot with long time girlfriend Jenny (guest star Juliana Dever and Seamus Deaver's real life wife).  Castle's daughter Alexis (Molly C. Quinn) tries to decide what college to attend when she starts to have doubts about first choice Stanford and starts an internship with Lanie.  And Castle's mom Martha (Susan Sullivan)?  She gets heavily involved in a case when she and Castle are held hostage in a bank robbery.  (And that episode is one of my favorites because it takes a cliched set up and puts a perfect Castle spin on it that blows all the others out of the water.)

As you can see, a lot happens over the course of these 23 episodes.  And most of the episodes are still in the light mystery genre we've come to expect from the show.  Fans will still find plenty of laughs and smiles as the season unfolds.

But there is definitely a darker tone to things overall this year, and that's appropriate as Beckett deals with the aftermath of being shot.  There is an especially powerful episode where the gang must track down a sniper, and Esposito must help Beckett work through her trauma.  The secrets that Beckett and Castle are keeping from each other come out in some surprising ways, and the writers play that brilliantly, making the character reactions completely believable.  Some of those scenes are pure genius.

Of course, all the writing in the world would be pointless if the acting were bad, but the actors rise to the occasion.  There isn't a bad performance in the bunch, as the actors obviously know their characters after 3 years bringing them to life every day.  Even Penny Johnson Jerald jumps into the mix perfectly.  This season is a wonderful mix of perfect writing and acting.

Plus there's a guest star that Firefly fans have been clamoring for since the show started.

The 23 episodes of the show are compiled on 5 discs in their native full surround and wide screen.  There are three audio commentaries on 3 episodes from the first half of the season.  Other extras include an in depth look at creating a key stunt from the two parter as well as one on the 1940's episode and the usual deleted scenes and blooper reel.

Fans of Castle will love season 4, and if you enjoy light hearted mysteries with great characters, this show is certainly for you.  I recommend starting at the beginning, but you'll be here before you know it.  It's really that much fun.",1433376000,,4665,4.551020408163265

4546562,5,B0053O89KG,"When my favorite show PSYCH ended, I turned to CASTLE hoping to restore my ""police procedure""l fix. I am now in love with this show! Not nearly as superbly silly as PSYCH, but the humor and chemistry between the cast is more than satisfying.  Nathan Fillon reminds of Jimmy Stewart, for some reason; he moves seamlessly between hilarious humor and serious drama in a very accessible way. Kata Stanic is not just eye candy but delivers a solidly capable performance as Detective Beckett. (Sometimes, her beauty is distracting but that's my problem!) Their chemistry is perfect and they ""sell it"" well! The rest of the cast is excellent and each episode keeps you guessing and laughing! As a result, I have bought all seven seasons and enjoy them immensely! Hope you do too!",1416441600,,772,4.804511278195489

It's all Castle's imagination as he reads the diary of a retired private eye. This episode is a tribute to the film noir style of story telling and all the usual Castle cast gets to step out of their regular roles into something different. It's very entertaining, especially to old film fans.",1415318400,,423,4.578947368421052

I don't know if the writers are new, but they certainly are getting better.  I look forward to seeing each new show and my sister and I call one another to make sure we don't miss it.  With the videos, we can just plug in and watch what we want to.  These two people should not be a match, but they are. The billionaire and the cop?

It's probably not the best TV series ever made but it's highly entertaining, witty and it also has it's serious moments, when meaningful things are said.

4546773,5,B0053O89KG,"This is a great crime dramady featuring Nathan Fillion who we all know from Firefly! If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of ""Moon Lighting"", ""Columbo"", and ""Murder She Wrote"".  I am now officially in mourning however as we're flying through the seasons.  My wife and I tend to watch a few episodes a day and before we know it, we'll be caught up and stuck waiting a week for each new episode!  ACK!!!!

The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration. He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc. Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch. Season four continues to refine the chemistry between Beckett and Castle and their relationship is always in flux with lots of tension and humor.  For the most part, you can jump around between episodes and not watch them in order.  It seems that there are usually 4 or 5 episodes in each season that move the greater story arc plot along.  The other shows, while equally fantastic, focus elusively on the murder of the day and not Becket or Castle's past.

As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6. We just started watching about a month ago, ripped through season 1,2, & 3 and are now wrapping up 4. Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back makes for nice unwind time after the kids are fast asleep!

Great chemistry with all the members of the rteam' great relaionship between Castle and his daughter; James Brolin comes into the mix as Castle's estranged CIA father.

Although I didn't purchase Kill Shot, I love the episode because Beckett has to face PTSD.

I love a lot of Season 4, but only purchased two episodes. I love it when regular cast members get to play other characters. JAG did this once a year and mostly quite well.

4546871,5,B0053O89KG,"A Season that started with Detective Beckett fighting for her life following being shot in the heart, and ending with Castle and Beckett finally becoming lovers, was a great season to start with.  But add episodes like Kill Shot (Kate having PTSD), Kick the Ballistics (a tutor is killed using Detective Ryan's gun) and Cops & Robbers (a GREAT episode where Castle is a hostage in a bank robbery and Beckett tries to save him).  Castle as an Elvis impersonator, Rick and Kate cuffed together with no means of escape, a film noir episode, and the two-part episode with the CIA that could lead to World War 3.

No doubt.  As a Castle fan, season 4 was the pinnacle!!

It was perfect for him, he can play the adult male that never grew up to perfection.  Stana Katic is a good foil, on one hand her character Kate Beckett sees only the adult child and cannot stand that.  On the other hand she recognizes he means well and he does have the ability to think outside the box of normal detective work.  Surrounded by a very good cast of characters I simply enjoy the show as one of life's little gifts.",1388275200,,536,4.215686274509804

The Castle character, for the most part has been such an incompetent buffoon you wonder how he could possibly be of any help solving murder cases for the NYPD.

He is absolutely witty in everything that he does and has a way of capturing your heart during dramatic interludes.  This series does not disappoint.  It has an amazing cast and a very well written script.  It has everything from drama to comedy and romance and I love the little things that just happen between characters like Castle and his daughter is very endearing.  I have three girls who also love and watch Castle with us and I hope they take Molly Quinn's portrayel of Castle's daughter Alexis as their real life role model.

I loved that they added Adam Baldwin, (those of you that are FireFly groupies will remember him as the doofus that worked for Captain Malcolm Reynolds).

4546982,5,B0053O89KG,"I love Castle.  I came to the show when season 4 was airing on TV but I started out by watching the first season on DVD.  I now own seasons 1-4 and season 5 is on order.  I ordered season 1 having never seen an episode.  I was persuaded to order season 1 by good word of mouth about it and my fondness for Firefly and Serenity, which also starred Nathan Fillion.  I fell in love with the show almost immediately.  As I have watched the show through 4 seasons it has consistently offered delicious fun.  The cast are excellent, especially Stana Katic as Detective Kate Beckett and Nathan Fillion in the title role as Richard Castle.  I have to admit that, much like the Richard Castle character, I have become smitten by the Detective Kate Beckett character.  And I totally empathize and relate to what Castle goes through as he tries doggedly to win her heart.  And I completely understand that she is more than worth all the setbacks he has had to endure in that pursuit. I know I am being manipulated into it but, almost despite myself, I find I am very much rooting for Castle and Beckett to make each other happy.  The quality of the character development here is outstanding and Katic and Fillion make us (or at least me) care deeply about their characters.  The supporting cast is very good too.  Castle has something for almost everyone.  There is action, mystery, plot twists, witty dialog, lots of romance, and no small amount of humor. As another reviewer aptly said, everything about this show seems to work.  All in all it is loads of fun and I can hardly wait for my season 5 DVD's to arrive.",1379116800,3,1605,4.448630136986301

The storyline of Castle stays fairly fresh, but the real sizzle is the chemistry of the cast!  Nathan is on my Christmas list and Stana makes me proud to be female!! You have the sizzle between Castle and Beckett, the sparkle of Alexis, and the wicked wonderfulness of Martha (go Susan!!)  Add Javier, Kevin, and Lanie along with the occasional Cannell, Patterson, Connelly, etc and you can't stop having fun with this show!  Flooded as my channels are these days by the oceans of reality insanity, nay stupidity! this is a most refreshing moment in the week!  Things are not quite so fun now that Castle has his Beckett in hand, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that our writers will find a fun solution.",1377129600,,901,4.571428571428571
4547019,5,B0053O89KG,"Yes, it's formula, and yes, there're almost identical actions and dialogue bits by the four main characters in the precinct scenes.  But Castle is a winner as a surprisingly dark TV crime drama.  The story arc across seasons for all characters, not just Castle and Beckett, is worthwhile.  And the gender role switch between the two main characters is especially nice--Castle cooks, loves his home space, cares for his family, and weeps.  Beckett is a workaholic, shows emotion only reluctantly, is good with a gun, is the youngest to make detective in NY, and isn't good at relationships.  Can't wait for the next season.",1376784000,,622,4.9423076923076925

  having just finished the 4th season, we can say that it is a whopper.  great story lines and again, character interaction.  esposito and ryan have larger roles, but the ""captain"" should warm up as she is a bummer.  castle goes through some tough stuff and comes out ... you will have to see it for yourself.  there are some continuing storylines, so you will have to be up on them to understand.  this one is the best, so far, but can't wait for the season 5 dvd. in september.  great show and great delivery by amazon.  it is an excellent addition to our collection...",1374364800,,578,4.428571428571429

I was channel surfing one day and saw him on some show called ""Castle"" and decided to check it out and I'm glad I did.  I laughed & chuckled through the last 20 minutes of the episode.  I was hooked.  I got online to research the show and found out it'd been on for a few years.  So I went back and started watching it from the pilot and decided to buy the last two seasons.

The chemistry between all of the cast members is great - the humor and the way they care and support each other in a dangerous field ,is wonderful to see. There are only eight main cast members, but one really feels as if you know them personally. Of course the romance between Detective Kate Becket and Writer, Richard Castle has had all loyal viewers biting our nails down to ""nubs"" throughout the series - will they admit to their feelings or not? And now the Writers have left us all with a true ""cliff hanger"" as Season Four came to an end. Cannot wait for Season Five.!!

I missed out somehow, on the first 4 seasons likely due to programming conflicts with some other show I watched  at the time, but now can't get enough of Castle! The chemistry between Castle and Beckett sizzles and his character is the epitome of what a woman wants in a man. Someone who is careing, attentive, loyal, funny, with a fantastic sense of humor, wit, charisma along with fantastic masculine looks and charm!  Beckett also is the poster girl for what most women would like to be. Tall, gorgeous, independent, yet vulnerable inside but still able to 'keep her cool', even though she is torn up with her personal conflicting feelings, emotions, and trust issues with Castle.
It is ONE great show and I hope that it goes on for years.  I could live with the couple getting married and even having a kid together.  That would certainly 'spice up their lives' and put a new twist on the show in the future!",1366156800,,1082,4.533333333333333

4547193,5,B0053O89KG,"After the shocking close of Season Three, the Fourth has to let us gather our wits about us and prepare for the consequences of that terrible action.  Not only is the opening of that season dealt with extremely well, but things go along with increasingly demanding cases that almost appear that Castle might have written them himself!  There are a wealth of good episodes, but the standoout for me was ""The Blue Butterfly""  a nod to the film noir of the 1930's and 1940's.  We get to see Castle and Beckett and Alexis in period costumes as they play multiple characters retelling a story revolving around love, deception and priceless jewelry.
This may be my favorite story played out so far, as it takes clever manipulation to make it work effectively  which it does very well inbdeed!  There are several times in the Four Seasons that certain plot lines interweave with surprising results.  It comes down to writing and firm direction, never leaving the path that the series started on.  I do not believe in ""spoiler alerts"", or the spoiling of anything so cleverly put together, so you'll have to do what I did: Rush out and buy some!  Season Five is coming along soon, so you'd better hurry and get caught up!  And remember: along the way through this series you WILL have LOTS OF FUN!",1365811200,,1289,4.638766519823789

Excellent acting by a cast that makes you believe that they are the characters they portray, storylines that incorporate the intricate process of police and detective work, personal relationships, plenty of action, romance and sexual tension, and just the right dose of comedy to make you laugh out loud. Follow these characters as they solve mysteries, assisted by a lovable mystery novelist who uses his own 'criminal mind' to give a different perspective on the 'whodunnit' scenarios in each episode, while at the same time balancing his life as a top-selling author, loving father to a daughter who is rapidly reaching 'adulthood', (most times seemingly more rapidly than HE is), and, to complicate things even more, dealing with his growing feelings for the NYPD detective he is shadowing as a muse for a series of books he is writing.

I was upset they took off ""Lie to Me"" with Tim Roth. Then when castle came on, it just seemed to be another mentalist type show. And in many ways it is. But the ratings and the fact Castle is the number one crime drama watched in and out of this country to date suggests there are man different components as well. And the fans know this, and love this show like no other.  Castle cant read minds of people. But the two shows have many of the same attributes. Man and a Woman, doing a job, same job i might add, and sexual tension. I have to say, i have been catching up, and i am up to date. I now am hooked on this show. It drives me nuts because i now have to make time for yet another show....What i do love about the show is Becket (the woman detective). She is what really got me to stay tuned in. I grew to appreciate Castle. There are so many layers to Castle's character then what they allow Castle to have. However, They need to do a little better with the writing and develop more layers to the characters between Castle and Becket. And If they do what they did with Bones? The ratings will feel it.  It is in its 5th season. Going into the 6th season or year next season. It's time to either put these two together or let it go. And if they do put them together, we should not have to watch them break up after four episodes like they did in ""House"", when House dated Cuddy.....I would like them to do is break from the traditional tv themes....No reason to make us wait, then put them together, then break them up shortly after. I am just hoping they come up with some original  material to work with, develop  the characters a bit more. I have no problem with them getting the two together, meaning castle and Becket. But do it already. Let the audience have some fun. The woman seem to love Castle, the men have to love his partner...she is beautiful, and they are playing her down...I like her even more than the lead woman detective on the Mentalist... I think Castle is fun to watch, and yes, the story line, or theme is something we have seen at  times especially in the mentalist.....but there is enough difference in the writing , acting, and the actors themselves, that make this show worth watching. It's good fun, and I would say its a must see. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it. But they need to do something with Castle and Beckett. And move their relationship along a little faster now. With tv executives ripping shows off the air just when we fall in love with them, they don't have as much time as they use to. They need to move things along a little faster. If they do, this show will have countless years left. .I say it's a must see....I do love this show.........",1363651200,,2835,4.27001862197393

Mood swings, repeating themes, lame plot twists...
Sometimes the studio uses the same tricks too often (for example, the ""let's spice up the suspense by starting this episode from the ending then then flashing back to the start""; I think this season had two of those episodes, which is two too many if you ask me). The bank job episode was another one that may have seemed good on paper, but the story's nothing new, and the characters are stretching their roles a bit beyond belief.
I think several episodes had HUGE potential, but fell just a bit short. The Blue Butterfly was a great episode. I absolutely LOVED it; but I don't think they quite nailed it. They were also onto something in the episode where Castle and Beckett were kidnapped, but I think it could have had a bit more of a Memento style suspense rather than remembering everything right away.
The ""Ghost Hunters"" episode was cool, and the zombie episode was PERFECT!!

Castle is one of the best written and acted and directed series I have seen.  It is a complete joy to watch.  And for Firefly/Serenity fans, this show is a must since Nathan Fillion is basically acting his Mel character but on Earth, which is amazing to watch!

This series continues to get better and better, and the end of season 4 finally delivers the completion to the biggest story arc in the entire series-- don't miss it!",1359936000,,617,4.685185185185185

4547372,5,B0053O89KG,"Only part way through this, and I am well pleased in how the makers of Castle keep the quality at a high level season after season. There is exceptional work presented here, by the writers, directors, crew and actors.
In the episode where Beckett is experiencing panics flashing back to the day she was shot---Stana Katic's work deserves an Oscar, and should get an Emmy. She is that good. Everyone else is exceptional also; the newcomer, Penny Johnson Jerald, has the tough job of replacing a well liked actor. And acting as a 'heavy' to counterbalance the leads. I just checked her imdb and it was from the Larry Sanders show that I remember her best, though she's had quite a career.
Long/short: Castle is a great show which I love to revisit on DVD. Season four is as good as the others. That is a miracle on television!",1359763200,,824,4.5369127516778525

That, and I'm a writer myself, so watching shows with writer in-jokes sounded like a solid plan. I've stayed with it because the cast chemistry is amazing, and even when the show is serious for a while, they never lose the fun altogether. The team that puts this show together is doing a great job. Every season that I buy, I burn through like I have to give it back to someone the next day. I'm always sad when there aren't any more.

Nathan Fillion (Firefly and Serenity) and Stana Katic (Quantum of Solace, For Lovers Only) are marvelous as the series leads, but the show has a phenomenal supporting cast as well.

Even if you haven't seen or don't own the earlier seasons, this is still an excellent investment. The episodes are strong but filled with humor. Castle brings his humorous twists to the crimes, yet often through his writer's eye he can see past ""just the facts"" to reach other not-so-obvious conclusions -- conclusion that often lead to catching the bad guy or girl.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes crime dramas, mysteries, sexual tension between characters, unusual bad guys, and an odd couple solving crime together. Oh yeah, and anyone who has a funny bone! This is humor and drama mixed at its best!",1356566400,,924,4.80503144654088

4547665,5,B0053O89KG,"Honestly, I don't own any of the series on dvd, nor do I watch them on tv.  The reason I started watching this show is because my girlfriend is a fan of it (and other crime dramas & murder mysteries like C.S.I. or Sherlock Holmes) and she's a Nathan Fillion fan (hard to compete against that dude :P).

The show is great though and while I had my reservations about it at first, I quickly grew to enjoy the chemistry between Castle & Beckett- the back & forth, banter and flirtatious relationship that constantly gets side-stepped or trumped by crimes, circumstances, or mixed signals.  It's a great combination of comedy, action, suspense & crime drama with a cool supporting cast and smart writing (first couple of seasons, at least).

The 4th season continues with the ""will they / won't they?"" back & forth of author Castle and detective Beckett, but it's done well, given a series like this can't keep it up forever because it'll get stale.  I haven't watched the 5th season yet, so I can't comment on whether the quality maintains or declines, but the first 4 seasons have been good.",1355961600,,1089,4.6217616580310885

4547682,4,B0053O89KG,"Season four of Castle is fun to watch, and of course in the finale they hook up. Hooray. The main difference between this season and the others (and the reason why I give it four stars and not five) is that it is slightly darker, which is not necessarily a good thing if you consider the show's premise. Other than that, you have of course a few episodes which are very, very, very well conceived and done.",1355875200,2,406,4.285714285714286

4547766,5,B0053O89KG,"I gave it five stars because that's all Amazon allotted. The cast is platinum moving crisply through episodic action with well-balanced humor and drama. Basically a crime of the week premise, it is also a love story. And just as criminal investigations rarely run smoothly, neither does the quest for love. Nathan Fillion has more natural charisma than the law allows and in the persona of wealthy, best-selling author Richard Castle the scripts give him wide latitude in exploring all facets of that personality. Stana Katic's Kate Beckett (my god, she's gorgeous) over the four seasons and into the fifth has matched facet for facet those of Castle. Beckett is yin to Castle's yang - and may well be the strongest series character leads going. The support players have strength and depth in their own rights and all meld well creating a solid tapestry to provide enjoyable episode after episode. So, what's not to love? Maybe that they only do 22 or 23 episodes per season?",1355011200,,975,4.879518072289157

4547823,5,B0053O89KG,"Castle and Becket play off each other well. The story line remains interesting. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic fit their roles perfectly. The writers are giving Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas more chances to show what they got. The boys deliver. They are good and getting better. Alexis is always a delight, and is mom the diva/actress. Between them they  always keep Castle on his toes. All in all this program is well worth watching. Nathan needs to exercise a little more, he's getting a bit chubby. Probably the hazard of being the star of a hit program. No time to exercise. Looking forward to season five.",1354147200,,609,4.691588785046729

4547932,2,B0053O89KG,"Well, here's a tough one.  First, Castle four shows are as good as all the other three seasons.  This is one of the best shows on TV.  Now, the bad part.  Each of the five discs always return to the same program watched after you watch it.  Takes an inordinate amount of time and manipulation to get to the next show you want to watch. Unfortunately I didn't read about Amazons policy about returning DVD's so by the time I had finished watching all the shows on season four, my time to return the package to Amazon, for a replacement of the defective package they sent me, is up.  So, I have three seasons of Castle that I can watch with no problem and one season, four, that is defective.  Thanks Amazon. Perhaps you should review and revise your policy on returning defective DVD's, at lease on an individual basis. Guess where I won't be buying season five or anything else from Amazon.

Just received contact from Amazon's service representative.  They are accepting my return of this item and will be sending me a new copy.  What a pleasure it is to deal with a company that reviews problems on an individual basis and is not adverse to making wrongs into rights.  I'm certainly back on board with Amazon after this one. What a pleasure it is to deal with a reputable company.  Thank you all.",1353110400,2,1298,4.453389830508475

Third season was about to start in rerun but the fourth season was a long way off and getting this set allowed me to catch up much more quickly. It's a great season with lots of high quality mystery drama and that comedic touch that Castle and the rest of the cast are so good at. Really lovin' this set.",1352592000,,575,4.133928571428571

4548052,4,B0053O89KG,"A late purchase of the DVD series, Castle, from Amazon provides a pleasant mixture of the romantic comedy and crime drama that sets it apart from the more serious attempts with the whodoneit genre.  It's an interesting twist in the well written series that the teenage daughter of author-crime fighter charmer Rick Castle is the adult of the Castle family. This Castle family includes a somewhat delusional mother still waiting for her break-out role in the theatre.  Detective Beckett is also an intriguing character riding the fence between being serious about law inforcement and being under the charm of that rogue, Rick Castle.

4548056,5,B0053O89KG,"Season 4 of ""Castle"" starts and ends with game-changing episodes. But all of the episodes in between are great, too. You get the trusty episodes with twists and turns that are all wrapped up in an hour, in addition to the continuing story arc revolving around the mystery surrounding Beckett's mother's murder. I really appreciated that in season 4 all of the characters have finally come into their own - including Kate Beckett - and the supporting cast gets more of a chance to be a part of the action. There are some great scenes where characters Kevin Ryan and Javier Esposito get to shine. And through it all, you see Beckett and Castle becoming more of a team, on and off duty.

4548085,5,B0053O89KG,"I love this TV series because it's witty and original, and since that's been better said by other reviewers I won't add anything about it here.  However, I will say that this collected episodes come in five dvds, all of them with bonus features, and that there are three commentaries for three episodes (""Rise,"" ""Cuffed"" and ""The Blue Butterfly"").  That's an improvement!  Also, among the bonus features there's a segment about a show performed live and in the style of radio serial dramas in which both Nathan Fillion and Molly Quinn participate...and it's quite enjoyable!  Sound, image, close-captioning are quite good (mind you, I've watched these episodes only in my Mac laptop) and it's a purchase that ""Castle"" fans must do.",1351123200,,731,5.016528925619835

4548108,5,B0053O89KG,"Each year I look forward to purchasing certain DVDs, number one on that list is the hit TV show, Castle.  I am never disappointed.  The show, by far the best television has to offer, is worth watching time and again.  I've never been disappointed by the quality of product from Amazon.",1350950400,,285,4.549019607843137
4548109,5,B0053O89KG,"I was in the hospital and our DVR went on the blink, so I missed the finaly on several of my favorite shows, including Castle. Thank goodness for Amazon, for a small fee, we were able to get all the shows we missed. Thank you, Amazon, from an avid TV watcher!",1350864000,,259,4.098039215686274
4548110,5,B0053O89KG,I was pleasantly surprised at the instant video service Amazon now provides. It is easy to use and is a great place to catch up on missed episodes for a small price. I especially liked the 1 click pay system that allows me to pay for the next episode/video with nearly no interruption in my video viewing!,1350864000,,305,4.368421052631579
4548111,5,B0053O89KG,I love this show. It hasn't gotten old or boring in the 4 season's it has been on. The new police chief could really go away but other than that I have loved it and look forward to the next season. I bought it off Amazon instant play because I was too impatient to wait in the long line on Netflicks and didn't want to wait for it to be shipped from amazon. Next season I will just buy the first episode and buy the disk because then I could sell them back after I am done watching and not feel like I have spent 20 dollars on air. I don't know if I would ever watch this season again without owning all the rest. As far as the Instant player goes we did have one night where it kept telling us it could not find my internet connection so I just plugged my laptop in to the TV's HDMI port and watched it like that. The fast-forwarding and rewinding are a pain and require you to wait till everything loads again. But over all I have been impressed with the Instant play.,1350864000,,970,4.0310880829015545
