Watching the constantly moving imagery is awesome. You never know what you are going to see next. Sometimes you're not sure that you're actually seeing something or just imagining it.

But every time you look over at the screen, it's something new and interesting. And yes, it is designed to entertain you while you're high.",1251504000,,938,4.644578313253012
