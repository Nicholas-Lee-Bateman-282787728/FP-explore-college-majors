In my opinion this films should be required viewing for anyone thinking about a career in nursing, because it so accurately portrays how it can really feel to work in the profession. It's amazing to me how little has really changed for nurses after all of these years. Carole Lombard is extremely effective in this lead role, a serious dramatic performance if ive ever seen one and she looks beautiful as always. She proves here without a doubt that she was so talented and dedicated to this role. I'm not an expert on picture quality, but the image looks great and well preserved to me. Really enjoyed this film!",1354147200,9,753,4.712121212121212

Enjoyed it so much I purchased two - one to keep and one to share with my 'sisters'.",1456012800,2,244,4.545454545454546

8469216,5,B005EXA8KU,Saw this movie recently on TCM and was very moved by it.  Hoping to show to my 98 yr. old mother who was a nurse at this time.,1408579200,2,126,3.5
8469217,5,B005EXA8KU,"Carole Lombard and Brian Aherne play, and rather well, a dedicated physician and nurse in Britain just at the outbreak of the Second World War in George Stevens seriously glum and well thought out drama. Compelling right to the conclusion which was then, as now, keep away from these lousy medical institutions. The DVD itself has a fairly sharp image and excellent sound. More than audible.",1377475200,3,391,4.9393939393939394

8469219,5,B005EXA8KU,"First of all, ""Vigil In the Night"" is a good old movie. Starring Carole Lombard and Brian Aherne, how bad can it be? And based on a story by A.J. Cronin, another plus. The DVD quality is fine. Frankly, I haven't seen this movie in perhaps forty years, and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD so that I could see if it's as good as I remember. It is.",1361318400,5,357,3.904109589041096
