8289245,4,B001CU5T8K,"I have great respect for John Chatterton and Richie Kohler, and when it comes to diving they combine their experience and insight into fascinating stories that are quite captivating.. For background on Chatterton and Kohler I could not recommend Robert Kurson's fine ""Shadow Divers"" or ""Hitler's Lost Sub"", one of the best episodes of ""Nova"" more highly.  There is no doubt that Chatterton and Kohler have made some significant discoveries on the seabed and have made important historical discoveries, and while I enjoyed ""Deep Sea Detectives - The 'Andrea Doria': Tragedy At Sea"", this was not their most insightful production and no real revelations are presented.

Although there is no groundbreaking analysis contributing much to the understanding of the collision between the ""Stockholm"" and the ""Doria"" or the subsequent sinking of the queen of the Italian fleet, it is a worthwhile production. The documentation of the status of the wreck, which has decayed with exponential rapidity recently, and the amazing footage of the liner they brought back to the surface is first rate and fascinating for ocean liner enthusiasts. I greatly enjoyed hearing them discuss their dive plan, which was beyond audacious and ultimately didn't work out; essentially they wanted to penetrate inside the wreck to find the site of the collision. While that would be an awesome feat, I sincerely doubt with the current state of the wreck that that will ever be possible, but the attempt itself is amazing.

The DVD also features a lot of historical footage, interviews, and background information that helps place the accident in perspective. Overall it is well done, but if you can watch only one ""Andrea Doria"" DVD I must recommend the excellent Italian production ""Il Naufragio Dell'Andrea Doria"" (with English subtitles) which features detailed information about and recreations of the sinking. By all means enjoy this installment of ""Deep Sea Detectives"" but don't overlook ""Il Naufragio Dell'Andrea Doria"", which, while a bit more obscure is totally worth the effort to find.",1437609600,4,2068,5.260606060606061

8289247,2,B001CU5T8K,"I purchased this to show to a class I teach.  We are  primarily interested in the factors that contributed to the accident; who made what decisions and when, how the teams on each bridge acted - and interacted - in a way that let situational awareness slip through their fingers, how the construction and stability of the ships affected the final outcome.  Bottom line: the research is very thin, the show is heavy on sensationalistic shots with long periods of silence.  There is a lot of emphasis on the exciting and dangerous aspects of wreck diving.  Unfortunately this video doesn't explore the questions of why and how the accident happened. So, it's a nice piece of eye candy, but you won't learn much.",1329177600,4,709,4.7317073170731705
8289248,5,B001CU5T8K,"Fantastic insight into the Andrea Doria. Includes Historical footage, individual accounts, an investigation into what happenned and also diving to the depths to see her. Highly recommended!",1283040000,7,189,6.037037037037037
