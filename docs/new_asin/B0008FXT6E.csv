8056027,5,B0008FXT6E,"Nada+ is a Cuban gem that portrays the seemingly simple life of a Cuban post office employee whose life takes a turn when she finds a way to secretly bring happiness to random people she never gets to meet face to face.

Cremata Malberti, the director of the film, has a fabulous knack for storytelling and a command of cinema that has been applauded in his newest film, ""Viva Cuba"", throughout the world. ""Nada+"" boasts a bold use of image and of typical slapstick Cuban humor.

A fantastic introduction to Cuban cinema and well worth every single little penny.",1422057600,,562,4.666666666666667
8056028,5,B0008FXT6E,"Thais Valdes Is great in this role and Juan Carlos Cremata Malberti, who debuts as director of this outrageous film keeps everything zany. Jean-Pierre would like this film. Highly recommended.",1389657600,2,192,5.433333333333334
8056029,5,B0008FXT6E,"Yes, a bit like Amlie in terms of creating an unusual world of imagination, adventure and puckishness. However, I also liken her to the Jean Seberg character in Breathless regarding appearance, mannerisms and adventurous spirit.

The world of work is a reality of existence in spite of its quirks. Love, when honestly acknowledged, delivers strength. Fantasy and vaudevillian shenanigans fade with an ending more thoughtful than one might expect.",1380931200,,446,5.463768115942029
8056030,5,B0008FXT6E,"I am a 31-year-old American girl who loves movies. I watch just about everything I can, especially independent & foreign films. And this is the most life-affirming, fun, and entertaining film I've ever seen. It took me by surprise, got me in a great mood, and left me wanting more. Other than ""What Dreams May Come,"" I don't think I've seen anything so visually creative (in a non-glitzy way, of course). I agree with the other reviewer's comparison to the French film ""Amelie,"" which I also love. If you watch only Hollywood films, then maybe you wouldn't like this film. However, if you're open to movies from the rest of the world, please give this one a shot!",1238457600,,663,4.627118644067797
8056031,3,B0008FXT6E,"In regards to the reviewer from NY disregard. This is a beautiful film that offers an independent and refreshing look at romance and compassion in a world filled with negativity.  The ""odd use of colors"" and ""overacting"" is intentional and most likely done to capture the style of Latin American magical realism writers.",1206403200,3,320,5.037735849056604
8056032,2,B0008FXT6E,"I watched this film expecting something well written and out of the ordinary. I read the previous reviews and on the strength of those opinions I rented this movie. Okay, the main protagonist works in a Cuban post office. She steals badly written letters and rewrites them but better. Then she sends them off. okay....and?

I watched, waited and waited for this dull film to take off. I waited patiently with an open mind for it to enlighten me or at the very least entertain me. Nada! Its an appropriate title for a film that delivered just that, Nada plus. the main character (Julia) was one dimensional, not at all akin to ""Amile"" who was a colorful and interesting character.

The leading guy whose name escapes me was as dull as a male supporting character could be. no actually he was worse spending most of the film wearing headphones listening to rock music completely detached from the busy story. If not for his being handsome, he could easily have been mistaken for a background prop.

  The only reason i gave this ""basura"" 2 stars was because at the very least It gives the viewer the opportunity to see some of Cuba, where as an American I am forbidden to visit and the film quality was pretty good but that's all.

Please don't waste a penny on this film. even our brothers in Cuba have to be held to a reasonable standard of creativity. This was a waste of film and a creative mess. The color was inserted strategically but pointlessly and the supporting cast simply over acted to the point of cartoon silliness. i read the subtitles however i do speak some spanish and even in spanish its weak. I have no idea what film the two reviewers before me were watching. i suspect they are related to someone on the films staff.  Good luck with this one.",1201651200,5,1763,4.5251572327044025
8056033,5,B0008FXT6E,"If you like independent films you will love this one.  It's creative and fun.  Don't let the fact that it's filmed in black and white discourage you from watching.  Color is strategically inserted into the scenes to plunge you further into the neurotic world of Carla's postal obsession.  For those of us who are prohibited from travelling to Cuba, you'll enjoy the forbidden scenery of Havana.  If you liked the french film ""Amelie,"" you'll love this movie!",1165104000,13,458,4.896103896103896
8056034,5,B0008FXT6E,"What attracted me to this film, I do not really know.  It was on the Spanish material shelf at the library, and I checked it out just to see what it was about.  I'm glad I did:  It was excellent!",1149811200,8,195,3.825
