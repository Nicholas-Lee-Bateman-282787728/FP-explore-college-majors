Very sad but so well written except that I was left wondering even after it was over about something that was said in the show.
When Mi-yeon was in the Doctor's office an old neighbor recognized her and started talking about the past. She said something about Mi-yeon & Ji-suk being married and having a baby (and her sister-in-law overheard this as she walked into the office). Then when Ji-suk rented the studio they used to share there was a cartoon Mickey Mouse on the wall as though there had been a child that lived there (and no one had rented that studio since they left) sooooooo the whole ""baby"" comment still has me left scratching my head.

Other than that I loved this show.",1362787200,2,766,4.394366197183099

It is a tearjerker, so beware. It is a story of forbidden love with unbreakable connections between the two main characters. Makes my top 10 best K-dramas. Kim Ha-Neul was excellent as well.",1358985600,2,354,4.546875
