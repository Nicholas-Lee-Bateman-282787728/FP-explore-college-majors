8746145,2,B019WMTZR0,Here's a good film with which to use the fast forward. This film is silly and boring until WC Fields appears (24 min into the film)  which is the only reason to acquire this DVD.,1483488000,,178,4.085714285714285
8746146,4,B019WMTZR0,"The film is a delight, criminally marred by the idiot who did the sound transfer.  A noise gate cuts off the sound between words, leaving unnatural silences and compromised intelligibility.  In one dialogue scene, we only hear notes of music from the phonograph while words are being spoken, but not in-between, suggesting the actors have swallowed tiny phonographs that we only hear when their mouths are open.  Audio professionals know--or should know--that you NEVER use a noise gate or de-esser or compressor on an old optical soundtrack.  This guy also applied an equalizer to make sure all of it sounded harsh and shrill and brittle, or as Stan Freberg would say, piercing.  The way to enjoy this film is in a room with a noisy air conditioner running on high to mask the dead silences.  Please tell me that Warner Archive won't let this happen to any other DVD releases.",1463961600,10,877,4.8133333333333335
8746147,4,B019WMTZR0,"Finally an official release of WC Fields real first full length talkie and his only one with Warner Brothers!
 It is a DVD-R, but it IS official from Warner Brothers Archive Collection.

The picture quality is very good as is the sound.
Field's does not get main billing as he is not the main character but he has a good deal of scene time and most all of it is very good,
with some great juggling and sharp witted as expected humor, along a a few soft hearted scenes as in his movie Poppy.

I'm thrilled it's finally released.

Now, someone please release the WC Fields 1926 silent So's Your Old Man!!!!!!

We're finally getting there Fields fans, the list is finally growing shorter of films we need released.

Now we can only dream for 4k restoration and blu ray some day!",1457827200,7,775,4.422535211267606
