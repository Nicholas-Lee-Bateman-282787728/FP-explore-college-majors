8395821,1,B003F2445M,"Omg do NOT buy these videos if you know how to bellydance.  It is basically a standard aerobic workout with a couple of body rolls and some King Tut arms thrown in.  The music is not right, she doesn't even learn the terminology.  Serpent arms?? And a whole lot of heel toe junk that you NEVER do in belly dance.  Ugh.",1455062400,,318,4.163934426229508
8395822,5,B003F2445M,Who knew dancing could be such fun. I have always wanted to dance but feel intimidated at the gym and  these videos really break the steps down and with practice you start to get the hang of it.  The Fat Burning Belly dance is a lot of fun.  The instructors are all so enthusiastic and the step guide learning segments are helpful.  A little more practice and I might even try dancing in public.,1299024000,,395,4.297297297297297
8395823,5,B003F2445M,I recieved the DVDs exactly as stated and I started with the ballroom dance dvd and there is a section to learn the basic dance steps and then while doing the dances the instructor goes over combination steps in small sections to get used to doing them before putting the entire dance routine together. It is fun and challenging at the same time and since I love to dance this is perfect for me.,1293494400,3,395,4.351351351351352
