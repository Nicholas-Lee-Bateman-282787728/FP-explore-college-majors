Snow W--- I mean Bianca sleeps with a rooster! There are only 5 girls in the whole school! They don't have any feet, so they don't walk, they bounce up and down on their big gowns.
The first cartoon revolves around them finding an open storeroom and pricking their fingers on the big needle on Sleeping Beauty's spindle and falling asleep! And they thought it was an exercise bike! The rest of the cartoon revolves around the dwarf who was supposed to lock the storeroom, walking back and forth to get the key. How did he open the storeroom in the first place? Who knows! This is wackyland to the 10th power!
There are two more ""stories"" I haven't watched yet, because I like to play the theme song over and over.
Send this to someone you hat.. I mean love who has little girls. I guarantee that the kids will play it over and over and make their parents smile.",1326067200,,1044,4.358974358974359
