8121607,5,B000FFH7H4,I really enjoy how these biblical accounts are very accurate. I am tired of the cartoons that water it down and just entertain the children....they miss the whole message and are being entertained straight to hell. I am grateful that they choose to tell it how it is! to God be the glory!,1365724800,3,288,4.452830188679245
