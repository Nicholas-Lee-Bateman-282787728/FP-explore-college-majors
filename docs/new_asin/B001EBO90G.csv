3548739,4,B001EBO90G,"this movie is great. Thats it. If you like Action. you will love this movie.
Yeah the story is basic, Acting is worse..
Unlike some, i enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so. Visually, i think it told the story well enough and conveyed the emotion. Maybe not perfectly, There are definite flaws, but it gets the point across. The child i thought did a good enough job showing expression. The first scene is kind of awkward, almost as if it belongs in a different movie, but that ends quickly enough, and sets up the finale.
Action wise, if you like Ong Bak, or The protector, this is more of the same, much much more. There is definitely a natural progression. You won't be disappointed.

  THERE IS A FIGHT IN THIS FILM WHERE AN AUTISTIC GIRL FIGHTS A GUY WITH TOURETTES.  Capoeira Style. That fight alone is worth the price of admission. Pay it and enjoy",1235606400,3,856,4.467948717948718
3548740,5,B001EBO90G,"Chocolate is the perfect ""acid test"" to determine who are fans of action movies and who are not. How so? Let me explain. A true fan of action movies has the ability to overlook some flaws in film-making (e.g., script, acting, character development, etc.) if the action sequences are exceptional enough to make up for them. This is no different from fans of art-house dramas who can overlook minimal content if the film can portray everyday life in interesting ways. With that said, Chocolate is one of the best examples of an action movie that has such extraordinary fight sequences that they easily overpower any deficiencies in the script.

An autistic girl with martial arts skill attempts to collect on the debts of her sick mother. This movie is not well written, and requires some patience from the viewer to slug through the early moments. Once the 30 minute mark arrives, however, the viewer is treated to one of the most amazing displays of asskicking by a female protagonist in the history of action cinema. Virtually all of the remaining 50 minutes is devoted to high quality choreography and bone-crunching maneuvers. The settings and scenarios change frequently, thereby avoiding any feel of repetition or monotony. This is brainless action at its very finest. JeeJa Yanin - an amazing specimen with her fluid moves and hard strikes - catapults herself into the upper echelon of female action stars with this single movie. Her punches and kicks start off rather basic, but get increasingly more complex until they peak during the jaw-dropping finale that lasts a whopping 20 minutes. Lots of fun to be had here.

Now, a snobby moviegoer will cry about the negatives without even considering the positives. Anyone who does not enjoy the action in this movie seriously needs to get their pulse checked, or at least schedule for a re-alignment of their action movie tastes. There's nothing more scintillating than watching a cute girl kick the living hell out of hundreds (quite literally) of stuntmen in a variety of environments. Basically, if you're not entertained by this, you're not a fan of action movies. (You probably didn't like So Close or Azumi either, right?) Stop fooling yourself and go watch another Tsai Ming-liang film.

Some critics have claimed that this movie ""ripped off"" other movies. It didn't. There are a few homages that last a few minutes at most (a few Bruce Lee references, a locker scene reminiscent of Jackie Chan, and some footage from Tony Jaa's movies). These few scenes are only a drop in the bucket, because 95% of the action is independent of any references to other movies. The sign-post battle on the apartment complex balconies is one glaring example of a completely novel (and breathtaking) sequence that pays homage to no one but itself.

This is definitely worth a blind buy. True fans of martial arts mayhem will end up re-watching the action scenes about a thousand times.",1233878400,154,2928,4.921052631578948
3548741,5,B001EBO90G,"This is an amazing movie! I laughed hard and long the first time I watched it and still chuckle after having watched it five or six times. Jeeja Yanin is a taikwando expert in real life, and believe me she has the moves! It's a good story as well, better and more accessible to a non-Thai audience in my opinion than those in the Ong Bak movies. If you like martial arts and the grace that women bring to them, this is a must-see. And if you don't you just might after watching this. More, please!",1233878400,3,497,4.1875
3548742,4,B001EBO90G,"Ever since the international successes of Prachya Pinkaew`s ""Ong-Bak"" and ""Tom Yum Goong"" with Tony Jaa, the U.S. has been flooded by a lot of action films from Thailand. Most recently, are Jaa's mediocre earliest films such as ""Battle Warrior"" and ""Spirited Killer"" just to capitalize on the Muay Thai magic in movies. Prachya Pinkaew, now returns with a martial arts film that will be categorized in the ""girls who kick butt"" genre; ""CHOCOLATE"" is a film full of hard-hitting fights and amazing stunts. Newcomer Jeeja Yanin (sometimes credited as Yanin Vismitananda) has the skills to be dubbed the ""female Tony Jaa""--after all, it is much easier to teach a martial artist to act than to teach an actor to do martial arts.

An autistic teenager named Zen (Jeeja Yanin) is a child born of an affair between a top-ranking Yakuza officer named Masashi (Abe Hiroshi) and a Thai woman (who was also a mistress of a Thai crime lord) named Zin (pretty Ammara Siripong). The Thai gang boss (played by Pongpat Wachirabunjong)  doesn't appreciate the fact that the Yakuza is muscling into his turf and Masashi was forced to return to Japan and Zin is left to raise Zen by herself. Growing up, Zen discovers that she has an uncanny photographic memory, and she can imitate complex martial arts moves by watching the students in the Muay Thai school next door and by watching Tony Jaa and Bruce Lee's films.
As fate would have it, Zin becomes stricken with cancer and she needs money to pay for her medical needs. Aided by childhood friend, Moom (Taphon Phopwandee) they intend to capitalize on her quick reflexes and incredible agility in a sidewalk show and by collecting debts that a lot of folks owe her mother. Little do they know that the past is closing in on them and it will lead to a final resolution to the events that led to her birth.

Martial Arts films usually have a simple plot and ""Chocolate"" (labeled after Zen's favorite vice) is no different. The problems with the film is that the plot may be a little overreaching and seems a little silly. A lot of its elements are underdeveloped and the script is a little scattered. The film's main premise of an autistic teenager with amazing fighting skills requires a very large suspension of disbelief; I don't care how good your reflexes are or if you have a photographic memory, one can learn the moves but one cannot fully gain the fighting ""savvy"" or the experience of rolling or taking a punch. The film gets a little absurd, the villains are a bit comical; the Thai Boss' second in command is a transsexual with his own gang of transsexuals. I think the plot would have done better without these elements, that it should have developed its more human side with a lot of emotion since it does have the potential to do so.

The plot's hollow storyline aside, ""Chocolate"" is a visual mayhem of violence. Zen's opponents go from easy to medium, from hard to ""VERY HARD""--it's almost like a video game. Jeeja has the necessary skills and I was very impressed with her athletic abilities. For a film like this, the action scenes need to be able to steal the show, and it does. The film is a stunt show, the fights are long and hard-hitting, they also get more violent as the film progresses; it displays Jeeja's martial arts skills to efficiency. Highlights include a very nifty meat market battle and the film's showstopper, the very stunt-ridden fights on the side of a building. Jeeja performed most of her stunts without wires, with absolutely NO stunt doubles and with this, I am very impressed. With the film's end credits, you'll see her sustain very real injuries when performing some of the stunts. Jeeja's performance acting-wise is decent for a newcomer, but it is clear that she needs to attend a few acting workshops.

The director also gives subtle tributes to Bruce Lee classics such as ""The Big Boss"" (the ice factory scene) and ""Fist of Fury"". There is also a cool animated ""dream"" sequence very similar to ""Party 7"" (which may also be a hint of Kill Bill?). There is also a very weird, quirky assassin who uses the Brazilian martial art Capoeira, who also wears a negative-colored track suit (Black suit with white stripes) as a tribute to Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death"".  The near-climactic encounter also occurs in a setting very similar to ""Kill Bill"", and I found it very curious as to why Thai mobsters would use samurai swords.

Despite all the very cool fisticuffs, the film's dark tones, the film does seem a little too hollow. The film became overly ambitious, it's as if it couldn't decide whether to be dramatic or comical. However, I do hope to see more of Jeeja Yanin, she may not be as charismatic as Michelle Yeoh or Cynthia Khan, but hey, the actress is still young and she's still developing. The film may not be as bone-crushing as ""Ong-Bak"" or ""Flashpoint""; ""Chocolate"" isn't as impressive as the best of Bruce Lee, Jet Li or Jackie Chan action films, but it is a satisfying enough martial arts film. The film is simply a stunt show, made to showcase Jeeja's amazing skills and fortitude--now, if she just goes to an acting workshop, she'll be awesome!

Recommended for action junkies and a good rental for everybody else. [3  -Stars]",1229212800,9,5221,4.691048034934497

The reason for watching this movie though IS the fighting, it's great! I loved watching the zany ways that Zen defends herself and sends the bad guys running.

The ""Bruce Lee"" fight scene was great and there were lots of Jackie Chan type stunts throughout, which added a bit of amusement.

3548853,4,B001EBO90G,"Disability in film is generally still a shaky matter that has yet to find consistently skillful representation, but developmental disability in particular is a taboo that seems to only rarely find outlets. Thus, when Jeeja Yanin broke into the Thai movie scene by playing a developmentally-disabled young woman in a martial arts film, the potential for mishandling the premise was high and the likelihood of bad taste even higher. Amazingly, action filmmaker extraordinaire Prachya Pinkaew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak</a>) proved himself surprisingly tactful in crafting both a great vehicle for Yanin and a unique, sincere action experience that I have yet to see replicated.

The story: When the autistic daughter of a gangster's ex-girlfriend develops an uncanny talent for kickboxing, she collects debts to pay for her mother's medical treatment.

From the opening dedication, director Pinkaew makes it clear that his story is a testament to the potential of ""all the special children in the world;"" it clearly was not a facetious decision that the lead character is autistic. While the 24-year-old Jeeja Yanin was not a child at the time of filming, she is the perfect vessel for the spirit of the story. Her performance is memorable, bereft of the blunt and insensitive exaggerations that a less talented performers may have resorted to when playing a character like this. While the character's savant-level prodigiousness in the martial arts may be without precedent in the real world, the more important aspects of this particular disorder - the behavioral, communicative, and social symptoms of autism - are recreated well and without condescension. I cannot say that viewers who are themselves autistic will be able to relate to or even like the movie - the ""supercrip"" factor is high, here - but I am certain that Pinkaew & Co. put much effort into molding an action movie around this aspect without betraying the experiences of real people.

A common complaint about the movie is its screenplay, and I am split on this matter. Any writer who is able to outline what I wrote about in the previous paragraph deserves credit, but admittedly, the story itself is not very dynamic and offers few surprises or challenges to the viewer. The film is quite dramatic and features some powerful performances - note Ammara Siripong's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Em-All/dp/B008XEZXLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill 'Em All</a>) especially multifaceted role as Yanin's onscreen mother - but I can only imagine how much more memorable they would have been were the plot a bit less simplistic. Characters tend to be either purely good or purely evil - an unequal parallel to something as complicated as autism - and the routine outplay of the plot should leave no one in doubt at the halfway point as to how the movie will end. I was satisfied, but the tale could be told better.

The action content is spectacular...to a point. I was blown away by the fight scenes when I first saw the film, but repeated viewings have sobered me a bit to their limitations. Yanin is undoubtedly a talented performer: she has no background in stunts, but it was not without reason that she was quickly labeled the female counterpart of Tony Jaa. However, the comparison is not entirely apt, because the choreography is largely no match for many of Jaa's movies. Almost all of the fights feature Yanin taking on multiple opponents, but the fight direction is largely limited to her delivering standing kicks to her attackers' heads and ribs - nothing else. Jeeja's delivery couples with good editing to provide an adrenalizing first impression, but people who watch a lot of karate flicks will eventually be able to identify the action's shortcomings. Among these is the lack of credible opponents Yanin faces: her showdown against an epileptic capoeira fighter (breakdancer Kittitat Kowahagul) shows some promise, but she overpowers almost everyone else with little trouble. It's a fun demonstration, and Yanin would prove herself capable of carrying out more complicated choreography in the future, but don't expect this one to utterly blow your mind.

Jeeja's sparse career since this film has been an uneven adventure. She was thoroughly downgraded when finally appearing alongside Tony Jaa in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector-2/dp/B00JVQ7RCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector 2</a>, which was enough to make me fondly remember how promisingly her movie reign began. Yanin still has a ton of potential and this world needs all the female action heroes it can get, but it can also use more unconventional lead roles like the one she had here. For all its shortcomings, the film thoroughly earns these four stars and is worth owning. Check it out!",1429574400,,4940,5.452287581699347

3548934,3,B001EBO90G,"In Thailand, Zin and Yakuza boss Masashi have gotten on the wrong side of gangster No. 8, who is apparently jealous of their love affair. Zin sends Masashi away, back to Japan, for his safety, without telling him that she's pregnant with their child.

The child, Zen, is born and Zin gives up her life as a debt collector for No. 8, raising Zen alone. Moom, apparently an orphan and being harassed on the street, is taken into the household, and the three support each other until eventually Zin is stricken by cancer. Without the money to pay for treatments, things look bleak. Moom and Zin stumble across an old notebook, containing debt records for Zin's old job. Mistaking the records for debts actually owed to Zin, they take it upon themselves to go collect.

Of course, these being loan customers of a criminal enterprise, they aren't too eager to pay up to these freelance kids. Fortunately, as it happens, Zen has lightning-fast reflexes and has been paying close attention to the Muay Thai martial arts school next door, and to martial arts films on TV. Throughout the rest of the movie, we get to see Zen gradually work her way through what appears to be literally the entire gang run by No. 8!

This movie blends numerous influences, from classic martial arts to more recent films of Jet Li and, especially, Jackie Chan. There's even a Street Fighter-inspired scene at the end.

This movie is action-packed. At the same time, the director and choreographer have done an effective job of illustrating Zen's gradual increase in competence. Early fight scenes are relatively simple, but by mid-film Zen's technical style has broadened considerably, and the final fights are chock full of eye-popping, bone-cracking sequences. Lots of use of the environment, a sword-fighting sequence approaching Kill Bill-level crowds, a boss fight involving another savant kid (also autistic, or maybe Tourette's?) that reminds me of Chan's Drunken Master, and the afore-mentioned 2D video-game-based sequence.

As in most martial arts films, the bad guys have the courtesy to line up, engaging just one or two at a time on the hero. The action is a less-fluid style, at least as compared to Chan's or Li's work for example. But the actors/stunt-men are giving it their all, and we see plenty of painfully real hits on-screen. As if the transfer of momentum seen during the fight sequences isn't enough, the director included lots of out-takes at the end, showing all the injuries, sometimes in painful multi-replay slow-mo.

Honestly, while I know it makes for good cinema, I wouldn't have minded if the producers had ponied up for some mats for the guys to fall on, and added a little more rehearsal time to avoid some of the worst injuries.

All in all, great fun. Yanin ""Jeeja"" Vismitananda (credited here as Yanin Mitananda) is spectacularly agile and fast, showing off great martial arts skills, and not a bad actor either, portraying this autistic savant of a fighter quite believably. Her performance, shifting effortlessly between trying to live her self-isolating life, caring for her mother, and reluctantly being drawn into fights where she is dominant over her attackers, is something to be seen.

The one glaring deficit in this movie, as presented here on Amazon's Instant Video (and I guess some DVD releases?) is the English language dubbing. Honestly, as dubbing goes I guess this movie's wasn't that bad. I've seen lots worse. But it's still dubbing, and it renders the original performances a shadow of their original selves. Minus a whole star just for that!",1412553600,,3573,4.953255425709516

3548947,3,B001EBO90G,"I watched this movie Chocolate because the concept of a martial arts master autistic girl was intriguing to me. Unfortunately, this is the English dub version of the movie and it is just terrible. I much rather prefer hearing them speak in their original languages and then reading the subtitles, no such luck here.

Probably the best voice actors for this movie were Mike and the main character herself. Everyone else? Ugh, my ears.

But who cares right? We're watching this movie for the action, right? Well, the stunts are certainly crazy and the choreography of the fights were well done.

Unfortunately, the cinematography left much to be desired and made some of the fight scenes feel kind of weak. I'm not sure what it was, but I just didn't feel that this movie had original and fresh ideas when it came to the fight sequences. It felt very been there done that and didn't have moments where I was like ""WHOA! She clobbered him good!""

The best sequence for me was when they started climbing on top of signs outside of the buildings. There were a lot of jumps and crazy stunts that apparently the actors did for real and hurt themselves. (Stupid in my opinion, they should have had safety mats but I know they don't do that in those countries.) However, even with that sequence it eventually felt like it dragged on for waaaaay too long.

To top it off, the story has no pay off and essentially turns into a movie of fight sequences. I mean, that's fine and all, but compared to Jet Li action movies or the one I saw recently, The Man From Nowhere. I don't think Chocolate matches up to their quality of fighting.

It was a passable movie, but if you're going to watch this, I'd recommend looking for a subtitled one. The audio dub is just, really, really bad.",1409961600,,1768,4.5266457680250785

3548968,1,B001EBO90G,"For one thing, you should NEVER dub a film. Dubbing takes away a great deal of naturalness and distracts the viewer from plot, acting, and meaning, and focuses it only on the superficial action of what are now, because of the dubbing, seemingly superficial agents. Dubbing destroys the movie's character and ""personality"", and reduces films to mindless sound and light escapades for the same people who don't really read but look at books for the pictures -- just like the people who make decisions to dub movies. And it is made even worse when the dubbing is poorly done, as it is in this case.

She plays a mentally challenged kickass kid who doesn't need to 'talk' or even act for that matter. Think Tony Ja reincarnated as a young girl. Seriously, if you like Ong Bak, you'll LOVE Chocolate.

Have patience for the quirky and sometimes corny scenes that lead up to nothing less than what must have been the most grueling fight scenes for stunt men that I've ever seen. If these guys didn't go to the hospital after shooting this film, they must be aliens from outerspace.

But after watching the movie, I wonder how it received so many 5-star ratings. Had they watched the same movie I just watched? It was pretty bad at the beginning because of its slow start and bad acting throughout the entire movie. The bad acting is attributed to the silly English dubbed voices, which is not the actors' faults. Perhaps it would have been better with subtitles. The fighting scenes at the end were pretty good because of the clever moves, but I'm not sure if it really makes up for all the bad that occurred throughout the movie. The autistic girl did beat up a whole lot of people, but sometimes the blows did not appear to land forcefully and many times she appeared to be moving too slowly. I was missing that ultra-fast paced, action-packed fight scene that I'm used to. I think it's because she's young and may lack some experience. She's no Zhang Ziyi or Michelle Yeoh.

3549021,5,B001EBO90G,"One of the best martial arts movies I've ever seen. First, the premise of a Rain Main type savant in martial arts who can mimic masters she sees in movies is simply brilliant. The action sequences which increase in complexity and depth in the second half off the movie are over the top genius. Granted, Miss Jeejaw Yannin does have the muscularity and raw ripping power of Jet Li or Donnie Yen but her moves are the real deal -- as evidenced by the bonus outakes at the end which this young actress is shown sending her fellow actors to the hospital with kicks and punches hitting their target brutally hard...not to be mention herself getting injured many times during the making of this movie. No pulled bunches. No CGI tricks. And real blood was drawn in the making of this movie.

Stunts appear to have done by most of the actor, as revealed by the outtakes. Unbelievable.

About the acting and dialog: Part of the problem is that this is a movie made in Thailand with English dubbing. It's really the fault of the actors who dubbed this than the actors playing the roles. But all is forgiven. 5 stars all the way. Watch this  movie from beginning to end and you'll see.",1386720000,,1174,4.4766355140186915

3549023,4,B001EBO90G,"I won't rehash all that's been said already except that she pulls off the autistic act well enough to be squirm-worthy. If you've seen many Thai action flicks, you'll be familiar with the bad dubbing, ludicrous and loopy writing, plot holes like potholes and an odd sense of where to use choppy slow motion.

That said, you'll also be pleasantly surprised at the choreography in this one, as well as the stunts. There's a really quick and unexpected result from a butcher knife throw. There's an impossibly long and precognitive setup to a rope stunt on a narrow balcony. Speaking of balconies, there are a few stunts that look like no-netters gone wrong, and if you stay for the credits, you learn they are exactly that.

Chances are, if you read this far, you'll like it. If you skipped to this line, you probably won't because you have no patience for the flaws of this kind of movie. It won't matter to an autistic Japanese / Thai girl named Zen (you read that right) unless you owe her mother money.",1385769600,,1004,4.572222222222222

3549027,4,B001EBO90G,"In my constant search for good kung fu popcorn movies I came across the name Yanin ""Jeeja"" Vismitananda. She is a Thai actress who was being compared to the action star Tony Jaa, of Ong-Bak fame. I watched one of her films earlier this year, This Girl is Bas-ass, and disliked it greatly. The film was an embarrassment to my wife. See, she told me, Thais, we don't make good movies. I disagree with her on that, but in this case I made an exception. However, This Girl is Bad-ass is not what made Jeeja famous, that was her role as Zen, in Chocolate. I finally sat down to watch this film the other day, and it is vastly better than This Girl is Bad-ass, but not the best martial arts film either.

 Chocolate is the story of a young girl with a mental disability, in this case autism, but this is movie autism. Zen, while not very talkative is talented in hand-eye coordination. Bouncing pieces of chocolate off tables and walls and catching them in her mouth, for example. Zen, like me, has a love of martial arts films and watches them constantly. It is from these films that she learns martial arts. Zen is the product of two organized criminals; one who is with the Yakuza in Bangkok, Masashi, her father, played by Hiroshi Abe and her mother Zin, played by Ammara Siripong, who is a member of the local chapter of the Thai mafia. This love affair is frowned about by Zins boss No. 8, played by Pongpat Wachirabunjong. The up shot is Masashi has to flee back to Japan, and Zin raises their daughter Zen by herself and a young boy she ends up adopting, Moom, played by Taphon Phopwandee.

 When Zen is older, and has watched a ton of martial arts films, her mother grows sick with some unknown, but curable, disease. I think nit might be cancer. Of course, the sickness can be easily treated with medicine that they cant afford. Zen and Moom accidentally discover that Zin was in the mafia once, and a lot of people own her money. So, the two go off to collect what is owed Mama. Of course, these folks are not willing to pay their debts, who is? That is when Zen begins to put to the test what she has learned from Master Bruce Lees filmography.

 The fight scenes in Chocolate are fun, even funny at times. They are more like the scenes that one finds in Ong-Bak. This is not a surprise as Chocolate is directed by Prachy Pinkaew, and choreographed by Panna Rittikrai, the same men behind the hit Ong-Bak. The fights happen in various warehouses of different industries, so there are a lot of deadly objects that get involved in the close quarters combat. There are plenty close calls that make you hold your breath, one including a spinning ban saw. If you watch the outtake reel that rolls during the credits, you will see plenty of times when these stunts didn't work out so well. During the fights Jeeja adds a sense of humor to Zen. Since she learned martial arts from movies Zen adds little nods to the heros she watched, like her own impersonation of Bruce Lees signature yell, as well as moves. There is also a vulnerable element to Zen, as she does not act like a spirit of vengeance, so much as a person forced to fight. She tries to get away, sometimes with a little fear, until she sees how she can best her attacker.

 As in most martial arts movies the plot is horribly thought out, and the acting is not all that great, hell at times it is down right bad. The film also takes too long to get to the end and the end scene is way over the top. It mimics the Crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, but with melodrama! In the end I had a lot more fun watching this Chocolate than I did watching This Girl is Bad-ass. However, this film still paled in comparison with Ong-Bak, and seeing how Jeeja was being billed as the female Tong Jaa, Chocolate should have been at least as good as Ong-Bak. Jeeja is a talented person, and I suspect there is more acting talent buried in her performances then the director is allowing to come out. If she were able to work with a different director, and a well written script, she could take the world by storm. Seeing as though she keeps working with the same director, and most recently in Tom Yum Goong 2 (The Protector 2) under the shadow of Tony Jaa, she may never get that chance.",1384905600,,4235,4.351898734177215

3549039,1,B001EBO90G,"This review contains no spoilers because it was totally rotten from the onset.

At 34 minutes into the movie, finally some actions starts. I don't know whether to laugh, turn it off or what.

In the first 34 minutes, you will get to enjoy watching this young Asian girl ATTEMPT to play an autistic child. Her sidekick is a very chubby Asian boy her same age who helps develop some motor skills with M&Ms and flies. This young girl yells and moans a LOT, in a tantrum type way. It is one of the world's worst acting jobs. Really. If you do not believe me, just watch. And the worst part, the bad acting does not stop once the action starts. She attempts to extract money from this group of guys in a warehouse and after she goes into an autistic haze induced by memories from watching Kung Fu on TV. After a very poor fighting scene, she ends up jumping up and down while being in a special needs outrage. ""Money! Money! Money!""

The first 34 minutes are very boring. The most interesting thing is where her chubby sidekick tries to make money from her ""catching"" skills at the mall.

Second action scene is at 40 minutes, in another warehouse, same scenario, better fighting this time. When I say better fighting, its an attempt to do some Jackie Chan fight scenes. She really doesn't fight, the camera pans away just at the last moment to make it appear as if she is doing something. The stunt men make it appear as if she has done something. Every time she makes a Kung Fu move, she makes this horrific, high pitched autistic squeal.

At this point in the movie, the only word the girl utters is ""Money!"" She is attempting to take money from people that owe her family some money. She is still moaning and throwing autistic tantrums.

At 47 minutes, she starts a job in a meat factory and the flies freak her out. More moaning and yelling ""Money!"" which sticking her hand out expecting money. The manager has had enough of her whining, and I don't blame him. So, he smarts off to her and she goes into another fit from watching a dead fly tumbling through the air in slow motion.

Get the idea? If you don't believe me, just watch it. The fight scenes are super fake. The only positive comment I can make is that the stunt men do a fair job of TRYING to make her look movie worthy. However, even they are not good enough to pull this off.

At 53 minutes, I turned it off. The whining, crying, moaning and hair pulling attempts at portraying an autistic person is more than I can take. One of the worst martial arts movies ever made. Negative stars.",1371600000,3,2550,4.364978902953586

JeeJa Yanin was incredible in this role of an autistic youngster who is able to learn martial arts simply by seeing it on videos she watches at home. Incredible indeed. This film shows the talent of this martial artist turned actress who trained for years to prepare for this role. She worked hard to achieve what amounts to the near impossible in martial arts that is rarely this astounding on film. The work she does here is absolutely incredible. Indeed the martial arts stunts in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. Setting a new precedent for a truly remarkable kind of martial arts wizardry. Her hard work in preparation for this movie paid off in spades. The result is one of the most impressive martial arts films in recent memory. There are plenty of respectable influences here, not withstanding the obvious connection with the Kill Bill saga, complete with a House of blue leaves styled fight sequence. And a nice addition was that I noticed JeeJa Yanin resembled Angela Mayo ying during some fight segments. Ying played Bruce Lees sister in Enter the dragon, who later attempted to become a Kung Fu star her self when she got the leading role in Lady Kung Fu which became something of a flop( look hard and you'll notice the resemblance), leading to Yings short lived acting career.

I sat down to stream a generic ""B-Movie"" with some notes of Martial Arts, and what I got was a cleverly designed plot-line; simple, easy to follow, slight Human Interest story, chocked--Chocolate--full of nuts corny, and loads and loads of extremely well choreographed Martial Arts fight scenes, virtually all with young ""Ammara Siripong"" getting hit, and flailing away. And she is excitingly good! Matter-of-fact, great, considering she was actually getting hurt, and performing while several guys got carted off to the hospital.

Some of the acting is okay but most of it is terrible, the dub over matches the lip movement but sounds extremely weird and akward, the fight scenes are not beleivable because you can tell that if you got hit by the little 65 lb girl who stars in it, it would be like getting hit by a fly swatter.  The story line..... wow, there's a fail. I mean, autistic people have serious disabilities with imitating behavior, the whole idea of her picking up martial arts from observation is just stupid.

I'm not being critical either. I'm a martial arts fan and I could kind of appriciate the choreography (which is actually very good, besides being almost entirely ripped from other movies) but it's just this tiny girl tapping people with her feet and them flying across the room, I don't know how you could beleive it.

It is a terrific movie with acolades to the choreographers, the stunts, the sets, the martial arts production crew; all of whom left me very entertained and impressed...",1351555200,,694,5.142857142857143
3549077,4,B001EBO90G,"I'm a big fan of martial arts action films, specifically the ones with the no CGI, no wire work approach seen in some of the Japanese films starring Tony Jaa.  I first laid eyes on him in Hard Gun(which was pathetic to say the least but it was nice to see the leading name as the bad guy) but then really became enthused with his work in the protector and Ong Bak.  That being said I also have a thing for the femme fatal genre, finding it refreshing to see a female show she can do anything a man can do and sometimes better.  In my mind I felt it would be awesome to mix the two.  The Tony Jaa incarnation with half the brawn and just as much skill...enter Jija Yanin.
I first saw Yanin in Raging Phoenix and felt that amidst the fighting, she also possessed a certain acting ability.  Shes is a girl who doesn't seem to mind to take the make up off, put the hair down, and show the more primitive side of action flicks.  In Chocolate she does just that, spending the whole movie with her hair in disarray, and walking around in your grandmas favorite flower print dresses and balloon pants.
Chocolate is about a mob woman who gives birth to an autistic girl(yanin) who, through watching martial arts movies and watching the people next door learn martial arts, teaches herself to fight.  When her mom turns ill, her and her cousin(I think, it doesn't really say who he is to her.  one reason why I only give the movie four stars)begin to try to make money for the medication need by showing off the autistic girls amazing reflexes(something she seems to be able to do before she teaches herself to fight.)  When the cousin finds a black book that has the names and amounts of money of all the people that owe the mob woman money, he and the autistic girl try to get the money back in hopes of using it to pay for the medication, which ends up inadvertently forcing the girl to fight.
The movie was entertaining.  The martial arts sequences, while sometimes you notice how far the moves actually come from landing, were still intricate and full of incredible moves.  Jija Yanin was really able to pull off the autistic girl character well, showing her acting talents strongly, but she seems to wake up when its time to fight.  In Raging phoenix she was the same way, which shows me shes more than just a pretty face in a martial arts flick.  She really does have some fighting skill, making all the fight sequences feel more realistic.
Chocolate is definitely worth the watch of any martial arts action junkie but may still be able to intrigue even the most critical of viewers.  It suffers mainly from a few bad camera angles, and a lack of explanation in some parts of a fairly strong storyline.  The storyline, of course, still takes a back seat to the fighting just like most movies  in this genre, but still takes a few feet forward.  Just enough to give the movie depth and realism.  The picture was a little grainy, showing a lower budget, but the sound was good.  If you can watch a movie and read(something I'm not real talented at) you may want to turn it on in Thai(Dolby Digital 5.1 if you can but there's also a 2.0 recording also)and kick on the English subtitles because some of the dubbing could really have been done better.
Either way the movie is worth the watch of any martial arts fan and a few others, and is recommended above many other movies of the genre.",1348790400,2,3382,4.399678972712681
3549078,5,B001EBO90G,"As the title says, do not watch this in the English dub because it ruins the film.

Moving on from that point, it is lovely to see a young woman who can not only rival well-known male martial artists, but also mimic Bruce Lee to perfection. If you have seen any of the behind the scenes footage, the majority of the stunt work was done by Yanin ""Jeeja"" Vismistananda herself, with no stunt doubles. That also means that a lot of the cuts and bruises you see during this film, are actual cuts and bruises.

Not everyone is as hip for the character development as I am. Maybe it's because I have worked with autistic children, so I am attached to Zen's character because of that. It is 100% possible for an autistic child to learn through observation, so the realistic nature of that works for me. I liked the ""emotional"" progression of Zen, where at first she is just mimicking, and is slightly obsessed with getting this one thing just because she knows she needs to get it, and has a limited understanding of how to solve conflicts. As time goes on, it becomes more personal to her, and she evolves from mimicking to protecting the people closest to her. She also have a lovely vulnerability about her outside of the fights. One of my favorite scenes is when Zen realizes her mother has lost her hair, and becomes frightened because she doesn't recognize her. In an attempt to be like her mother, she ragefully cuts off most of her hair. I like the way the film steps away from the action, and reminds viewers that there is more there than just cool looking fight scenes.

Sure, it's an action film. The fight scenes are fantastic and beautifully choreographed. The story-line to me is just amazing. Zen starts off as a child who becomes heavily interested in the Muay Thai boxing school next door, and begins practicing their moves after watching them. As she gets older, she learns more fighting skills from TV, movies, etc. Eventually, Zen and her brother, Moom, start trying to collect money to pay for their mother's hospital bills. Once they find her journal containing the names of people who owe her money, without questioning why their mother even has this book, they start visiting these people and asking for the cash. The first individual they visit, picks on Zen to the point of hitting her, which pushes her to use her new-found skills for the first time. I won't go too much into detail, but the deeper they go into the world attributed to this journal, they find more secrets about their mother, Zen's father Masashi, and No. 8, the leader of a rival gang.

Also, the final part of this film is very action packed and creative, but also very emotionally gripping, and worth watching the whole film to see.",1343433600,,2722,4.583162217659138

Yanin ""Jeeja"" Vismitananda , is the female version of Tony Jaa and she is wicked awesome just like him. It's extremely ironic because even in this movie she is watching clips of tony jaa from ong back and I though they were like brother and sister or something, or maybe train with the same master/ team. I also was thinking she was semi-sexy but felt guilty because I though she was really young like a teenager , but it turns out she is actually 28 so that just makes her even more appealing. THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE LIKE JEEJA MAKE ME WANT TO GO OUT AND TRAIN TO BE A BAD A@# JUS TLIKE HER AND WHO KNOWS I JUST MIGHT. This movie is action packed with martial arts leaning on the thai martial arts style which i love with all the agility, knees and elbos! I really don't understand why people like tony jaa and Yanin V aren't more popular? Give this movie a try if you are any kind of action/ martial arts lover and you will never be disappointed.

My biggest question about this movie was why were all the womenn on the bad guys side transvestites? I am not joking I think they were that or they are just really ugly women, The girl was ok and so was the mom and there were alot of other women in the movie, but I think every woman with the bad guy was a guy dressed as a woman, and thier voices were obviously fake.  Maybe In thailand having men play the parts of women is a cultural thing like kabuki theater in Japan, I don't know. I do know that it really distracted from the movie. If someone could explain it to me a would really appreciate it.

3549084,5,B001EBO90G,"I think a lot of the people reviewing the film don't have a family member who is on the autism spectrum, and for them instead of that part of the storyline adding to the film, it detracts from it a bit.  I'm not being critical of the negative reviewers because in a way it is a problem with the film.  They made a high quality martial arts film while at the same time trying hard to send a positive message (in my opinion) about people on the spectrum, and for many the two don't mix.  I would think it might make a good date movie with both people coming away happy having seen a different film. :)  My son is on the spectrum, and we felt they did a great job in how they portrayed the autistic girl, and also the fight scenes were awesome.  I would think that anyone who is a fan of martial arts films (especially the classics) would love this one.  The girl is actually a skilled martial artist in real life, and if they used any CGI, I didn't notice it.  My only complaint is that there was a little more blood than necessary.

As one reviewer said, if you didn't like this, you are just not a martial-arts movie fan!  Each fight scene is filled with some of the most amazing acrobatic sequences I've seen, and each move looked very authentic.  Yes, much of it is like Jackie Chan and Ong Bak, and I love their movies too.  This girl is very fluid and looks like she packs a lot of power in her kicks and punches.

The only thing that would have made this movie better is if she wasn't autistic.  It made for some funny moments, but I would have preferred if she were normal.  The autism just didn't add much to the story, except to explain how she picked up the fighting moves so quickly.  But hey, the action more than made up for any weakness in the writing.

3549097,5,B001EBO90G,"Let's start by ignoring the title.  The chick likes M&M's.  That's it.  That's the whole purpose of the title.  Let's instead call it LITTLE THAI WARRIOR CHICK BLOWS MY MIND.  Then this review will make more sense...

 Zen (Jeeje Yanin) is a special little Thai girl with special needs.  Mimicking students at a nearby Muay Thai school, she started kicking support pillars and conditioning herself like a little Tong Po (Kickboxer) in the making.  Later we find her watching Tony Jaa in The Protector.  So naturally she becomes mistress knee-and-elbow.  We discover her combat talents early in the movie when a group of hoodlums try to get rough.  I have seen VERY little fighting choreography including children that I thought was impressive.  While brief, it was GOOD.  [Okay, they're all really adults, but they are portraying children.]

 The filming style allowed you to see that multiple techniques were filmed together and not individually filmed and then edited together for a more choppy, weak fight scene.  There is also a little Jackie Chan in there.  Some of her dodges are regular, every-day motions which happen to result in avoiding being hit, so it appears as if she wasn't even trying to dodge the attack.

 So Zen, with mad M&M popping skills and a mean Ong Bak jump kick, realizes that her mother will remain sick in a hospital unless she can get some unsavory folks to pay back debts to her mother.  At first she was a bit unready to fight for her family.  But thank Buddha the spirit of Tony Jaa came to her in a vision so that she could kick some ass.  [This really is how the movie progresses.]

 This youngun' fights like Jaa, utilizes improvised prop weapons like Chan, and stunts about like both.  At times the stunts are a little slow, if not forced upon us, but overall the sequences are long, nearly continuously filmed, well-choreographed and, most importantly, just plain fun to watch.  Lots of flaired corkscrews, 720's and 540 kick-fake-kick's.  At first I was a little annoyed at just how affected some of these goons seemed to be by a skinny little girl's kick to the stomach or head.  But hey, she's not kicking them through walls and the fighting seems to use no wire assistance EVER.  This combat actress will have one Hell of a future if she has a chance to tone up a bit to sharpen her acrobatics.

 The closing action sequence, which is way-awesome-long, reminded me of longer fight scenes in The Matrix: Reloaded or the opener from Jet Li's Fist of Legend or, to beat a dead horse, a Tony Jaa movie closer.  It was inspired, exquisitely done, and had one of the most painful looking sets (for a bad guy) I've seen in a while.  Lots of nasty looking falls.

 The fights are quite creative, just as much as those reserved by choreographers for Jaa himself.  If you can tolerate action movies with subtitles without getting a headache then do yourself a favor and watch this movie--especially if you enjoy Tony Jaa or Zhang Ziyi movies!  If you fear that seeing a young girl (actually she'll be 27 in a few months) generate as much kicking power as she does will upset you, stop whining and see it anyway...and LOVE IT!  Just consider this movie her interview to earn your action movie fanfare.  She hasn't done much, but I want to see more of her.

 P. S. Beware the Thai Boy-Girl Gang and autistic kids.  You'll find out what I mean.

 For those who watch and love this I'd point you to The Protector, Ong Bak, District B13, Mr. Nice Guy...catch the hint?",1309564800,3,3496,4.613008130081301

3549100,4,B001EBO90G,"Chocolate is a very good but rather off-kilter martial arts movie. The hero, Zen, is a 14 year old autistic girl with an uncanny ability to instantly learn martial arts simply by watching. Zen kicks ass to collect money owed to the family so she can pay for her mother's chemotherapy. Meanwhile the mother's ex, a possessive gang lord served by a posse of armed and dangerous transsexuals, is trying to keep her from reconnecting with Zen's father. I'm totally not kidding; that really is the plot.

The set-up of this bizarre plot takes the first 20-30 minutes of the movie but, fear not, what's not off-kilter about this movie are the fight scenes. They absolutely rock! When star Yanin Vismitananda gets going, she displays definite skills. She's not as sharp as Tony Jaa or Jet Li or their kind, but she more than delivers. And once the action starts, the fight scenes come fast and furious. There's even a bit of ick factor thrown in for extra giggles. And despite the fact that I usually find guns disruptive in martial arts films, I felt they actually add to the action here rather than detract.

Another reviewer that suggested this movie is a good test of who's really into the genre. I agree. The plot for the movie admittedly requires substantial suspension of disbelief if you're going to swallow it (I mean, really???). However, while I feel an inventive plot can be a plus in the genre, the main reason these movies exist is for the martial arts skills being displayed. So if you watch Chocolate and spend your whole review complaining about the weirdness of the plot or the lack of acting chops or the minimal plot development, then you clearly shouldn't even be watching the movie to begin with.

Of course, the premise means that there's very little of the martial arts spirit to be found in Chocolate. That's a loss, but what we ultimately have here is a very well-made martial arts movie full of off-beat elements that set it apart. For example, to cap off the big fight scene inside the restaurant near the finale, Zen faces off against another 'special needs' martial arts prodigy. As I write this, I am fully aware of how totally ridiculous this sounds, but it worked! I recommend this movie.

On a random note, this is the second movie directed by Prachya Pinkaew that makes prominent use of transsexuals as total bad asses (see The Protector). It's certainly interesting to see transsexuals playing characters like this, especially as the movie presents them as if there's no reason in the world to explain their presence. I like that, but I still wonder about their prominent presence. Are transsexuals more accepted in Thai culture than in the US? I saw other reviews of the movie where the reviewer didn't object to the violence in the movie, but seemed to be wigged out by the transsexuals (?). It made me laugh because doesn't it seem a bit...I don't know...wussy? What's the big deal?

3549101,5,B001EBO90G,"It's a little slow to start, plus you're trying to figure out exactly what's going on. The star of this movie is just terrific. The choreography is outstanding. The dubbing is ok, but I think they messed up a little and is why it can be a bit confusing figuring out what's going on.

It has a bit of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Tony Jaa, and even some Jet Li spice in the action. Just when we started getting a little bored, it took off and then you breathe a little....only to take it up a notch an then repeat the cycle until the end which takes a while and is non-stop action.

Best thing to do, imo, is just relax and go with the flow of it so you can appreciate it as it winds up and gets downright terrific.

3549102,2,B001EBO90G,"I grew up watching the old dubbed kung fu movies of the 70's.  Yes, the script is bad, dubbing is worse, the acting is horrible, and the story line is the same.  So you watch it for the action.  After a while, you realize the fight sequences are pretty much the same, so you look for some originality.  This movie is in the category of same old, same old.  It contains all the basics of a martial arts film from Thailand.  The fight sequences are similar in style and execution.  The only difference is that the lead character is played by a female.  The plot is about a gang feud and a family member in trouble.  The acting, directing and script is horrible.

However, if you have not seen this genre of martial arts film, it is worth watching for the action.  Just beware that the fight scenes don't really start until 30 minutes into the movie and you have to sit through an atrocious story line that doesn't make sense.  But you will be rewarded with some good action scenes.  One other note to add is that the movie had one original idea.  The concept of an autistic girl whose ability is to mimic muscle movements.  I almost gave an extra star for that but couldn't due to the unoriginality of the fight sequences and the horrible story line.",1299542400,4,1248,4.3652173913043475

The movie is primarily about a girl with autism (who has some wicked dreams btw) that has the ability to learn and memorize Kung Fu moves. When her mother is sick she wants to do everything she can to help her even if it means beating up a few hundred men.

The fight scenes are pretty good and Yanin pulled off some amazing stunts and martial arts moves. Strangely Yanin looks like a 14 year old girl but she was like 20 something at the time of this film which is interesting.

There's some pretty fun and interesting stuff about the movie especially the end credits where you get to see the movie is realer than you think.

The story is original and the action is really amazing, but the lead character's acting as an autistic girl was very.... weird. She came off looking more like a whiny child to me and I found her very annoying when she'd speak. I don't know, it's kind of hard to describe.
The movie was fine until she'd start to talk, and then it just didn't hold together.

The fight scenes are amazing though, and the premise of the story was pretty good for what it was.

Needless to say, they are less than willing to part with any until Zen starts kicking the hell out of them.
  It may not be a complex enough plot for some tastes, but one must remember that many stories in life are indeed sometimes simple and straightforward. What makes this film stand out however are the fight scenes and the female lead, Jeeja Yanin, who truly gave her very best.
  The making-of documentary extra is also of great interest, as it showed just how much goes into preparing each scene. As the participants did everything without resorting to special effects (a bonus these days), in order to convey proper realism, there were of course plenty of accidents. A full medical crew was on hand at all times to take care of all the bumps, bruises and breaks.
  Jeeja Yanin, whose background includes tae kwon do and gymnastics, spent two years training in various martial arts such as Muay Thai kick boxing and Gung Fu to prepare for the role. Each scene also involves fighting in unusual and difficult environments such as a factory, a slaughterhouse, and on the roofs and high ledges and even the neon lights of the city.

3549110,3,B001EBO90G,"""Chocolat"" is an enjoyable film about a single mother Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her nine year old daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) who are gypsies wandering from place to place setting up chocolate shops.  They are blown in by the north wind to a quaint, French village, full of church-going strict Catholics.  The year is 1959.

Vianne is part Mayan, and carries her mother's ashes as she moves from place to place in a Mayan clay pot.  Vianne is an unwed mother that respects the Mayan Pagan religion as well as chocolate, which was an important part of Maya and Aztec life.  It was part of religious events, with Mayan Priests offering chocolate drinks during sacred ceremonies.  Vianne leases a small shop right across from the church during Lent and sells rich, delightful, sensuous chocolate desserts.  This opens the door to happiness and love.  At first this upsets and scandalizes the town, but one by one they succumb to the tasty treat.

Both Vianne and her daughter, Anouk, refuse to attend church but remain good-natured during attacks by the conservative mayor, The Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) and the straight-laced, helicopter mother Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) who has disowned her own mother and refuses to let her son see his grandmother.  Judi Dench plays the grandmother, and is also Vianne's landlady.  It is a sweet, smart story and dashes of spice are added with the supporting actors (Lena Olin and Johnny Depp).

The plot of course is simple, focusing on the efforts of young Zen, (Jeeja) to recover funds owed to her cancer stricken mother from her days as a moneylender for a criminal gang, a mission which brings her into several violent confrontations with gangsters. The plot twist, which makes the whole film, is that Zen is an autistic savant, who has assimilated the techniques of the greatest martial artists whom she has watched on TV, from Bruce Lee, to Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and of course, Tony Jaa. (who helped train Jeeja for this part, a program which took her 4 years.) There are many things to criticize in this film, but these fall away quickly and are overcome with the escalating storm of adrenaline which kicks in, as Jeeja demolishes wave after wave of attackers using techniques which are right up there with the best in their execution and form. The one thing which explodes from the screen, is the ferocity and fighting ability which flows from the 5'3"" 93 LB little Jeeja, who uses her lithe frame like a whip with a hammer on the end, bringing more power to bear with each kick and elbow strike than you can believe from someone so small, and so cute. She is also very authentic in her sensitive portrayal of an autistic girl, which she prepared for by spending time at a home for autistic kids to observe. For her acting debut, she is superb, and has a fantastic future ahead if she can broaden her audience to the West, and get some Michelle Yeoh type parts.",1264550400,15,1710,4.588235294117647

From that point on there is no point - only the battle. And the battles are amazing!

If you are a fan of martial arts films then you must watch this film just to experience the amazing fights. The final battle on the side of a five story building, with no wires or stuntmen, jumping up and down levels, fighting and then moving onto and off marquees is one of the most amazing sets ever seen in an action film.

If ""Street Fighter: Legend of Chun Li"" had been anything like this, it truly would have been legendary. But instead, we got the typical martial arts movie where the fights last 20 seconds and the editing is so choppy that it's obvious they're trying to hide the fact that nobody is actually doing anything. In ""Chocolate"" you can tell these are REAL martial artists doing REAL martial arts! All of the fight scenes are more than satisfying and you will go ""ouch!"" several times!

The storyline is also really good. The actress playing an autistic girl comes across very believable if you know anybody with autism. The rest of the story with the bad guys is kind of thin and really provides nothing more than one action scene after another. But that's really what you watch this movie to see.

JeeJa Yanin plays the coltish teenage star, Zen - although 25 or so when this movie was made, her slim figure works well in the role. She also does an outstanding job with the martial arts work, as a one-woman army cutting through the thugs like a cleaver. On top of that, she does a pretty job portraying the girl's mental disabilities. This movie maintains a respectful attitude towards her and her disability. In fact one of the big fight scenes pits her against a disabled boy who happens to be about the baddest on the block despite his differences. And it manages all that without a preachy, smarmy tone. Good, acrobatic fights, distinctive characters, and something bordering on a plot - you could do a lot worse.

3549131,4,B001EBO90G,"It has been five years since director Prachya Pinkaew surprised us with his action-packed ""Ong-bak"" starring incredibly fast and agile Tony Jaa. The Thai-based director's latest effort ""Chocolate"" stars another incredibly fast and agile newcomer, the difference being that this time the star is a 24-year-old woman who, according to the director, trained for this film for four years.

Yanin ""JeeJa"" Vismitananda (her debut) plays Zen, an autistic teenage girl and fighting martial artist. She can pick up every martial arts move just by observing it. Starting with Muay Thai (she happens to live near the martial arts school) Zen slowly learns the necessary skills, which she has to use to survive when her mother Zin becomes ill. Together with an orphaned boy Mangmoom (Taphon Phopwandee), Zen, who needs cash for expensive medicine, goes to her mother's debtors to collect money. They refuse and her bone-crunching action starts.

""Chocolate"" is virtually a showcase for the ability of amazing Vismitananda and the stunt people who did a fine job here. It must be said that the choreography with props, great as it is, looks sometimes familiar as if borrowed from other martial arts films such as Jackie Chan films, but it is also true that the heroine displays a unique fighting style especially when she jumps and kicks high in the air. The film's thrilling climax features our heroine's long, bloody battles against the horde of henchmen on the facade of the building. In some sequences wires are used, but the film's stunts and actions are a real thing.

To be honest, the story and characters do not convince. As Zen's father (and yakuza) popular Japanese actor Hiroshi Abe appears - to Japanese viewers, however, this is as convincing as Keanu Reeves playing a gangster. While watching the jaw-dropping actions of the heroine, however, you will stop complaining and be amazed by the incredible skills of Yanin Vismitananda. So, please forget the story and enjoy the actions.

Hiroshi Abe said in his interview with the press in Japan that his sword fight scenes were not in the original take. The filmmakers decided to re-shoot the climax after more than one year had passed since the original shooting and Abe agreed to fly to Thailand to film the ""Kill Bill""-like finale.",1243641600,2,2282,5.013192612137203

It is not going to garner any high brow artistic awards but, this story of an autistic girl who manages to harness her strength to help her sick mother is a winner.  Granted, the plot was a little soap opera-ish but it was moving and the fight scenes were furious.  I enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish.  I did not enjoy the english dubbing on this version.

3549136,5,B001EBO90G,"A Thai production, ""Chocolate"" starring Jeeja Yanin takes us back to the good old days of martial arts films.  With just enough story to be coherent and more than enough fight scenes for anyone interested in this genre, this is probably the ""purest"" martial arts film to be seen for some time.  No magic items, no snazzy special effects, no high wire work, just a tiny little acrobatic woman kicking serious amount of bad guy fanny.  That for me was it's greatest appeal.
Jeeja Yanin plays ""Zen"" an autistic young woman who's mother was at one time associated with the criminal underground.  Zen's mother becomes sick, and to pay for medicine and care, Zen (with the help of her friend and her mothers book of markers) begins her attempt to round up the outstanding debts still owed to her mother.  What no one realizes is Zen has the ability to learn a martial art simply by watching someone else perform it.  This is the entire setup of the movie, and everyone that owes her mother money tries to brush little 90lb Zen off, or more foolishly, sics their own tough boys on her.  Big mistake.
Without giving too much of the plot away (not that their is much plot beyond the original setup.)  The joy of this movie is simply watching the fights.  Look for homages to: Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan and others in her fight scenes.  The kicker of course is that Jeeja Yanin performed all of her own martial arts and stunts.  And what stunts they are.  There are times you'll find yourself shaking your head in amazement saying ""How did she do that?""  A truly fearless actress who is not afraid to take, or throw a punch.  The fact that she pulls off a reasonable depiction of someone suffering from autism is just icing on the cake.
Not for everyone, this movie is violent, cruel in parts and a little depressing sometimes. In other words, not for children.  But for those of us who remember the first time we saw Jackie Chan, and were amazed that an actor actually did all his own fighting and stunts, This may be the movie for you.  Fast,nasty, and a whole lotta fun, ""Chocolate"" gets a 5 star from me, not for the story, or even for the acting in some cases, but for the fights and the star.
Look out Jackie Chan.  A new action hero is born, She's Thai, about 5'4"", and can put her foot right up side your head.  Don't let the language barrier or the marginal localization stop you.  See it soon so you can someday tell your friends: ""Oh yea, I knew she was gonna be a star when I saw ""Chocolate.""
The best part is, you'll get to not only be smug and in the know, but it gives you an excuse to watch it again to see your friends amazed.",1240531200,16,2637,4.355828220858895

3549140,4,B001EBO90G,"This is a movie that breaks some nice ground:

1) Diversity - The heroine has a mental disability- also, several supporting characters appear to have mental- or nervous- disabilities. Transgender / Transsexual characters feature prominently as well.

2) Realistic martial arts - The choreography uses fake kicks extensively. It also has a lot of ""hit em on the ground to make sure they stay down"". Quite nice compared to the ""always 100% sure"" recent stuff.

Things that keep me from giving it 5 stars:

1) The english dub is awful. I found myself switching into the native languages and turning on english captioning within a minute or two.

2) The story expects you to bridge gaps. You never really know what the heroine's mother is in relation to the Japanese mob boss or the main mob boss.

3) The story arc is as old as any other corny revenge movie.

4) The choreography was a little too robotic and rhythmic. Also, the heroine is obviously on wires at some points, when the trailers suggest no wire work.

5) The music was by and large ridiculously horrid. I think it didn't clash with the scene exactly 2 times. The rest of the time I was gritting my teeth.

Although the negatives greatly outweigh the positives, I think the film deserves 4 stars for the wonderful acting (both as a child with disabilities and also the grueling stunt work) of the main character, and the boldness of the film house in funding such a project.

3549142,3,B001EBO90G,"If you have read any previous reviews of this film and wish to see it, you may suffer from great expectations.  Not only the worst thing Dickens ever wrote but the easiest way to kill what might otherwise have been an enjoyable romp at the movies.  I'm not sure that lowering one's expectations would've helped this one too much.  Even in bad movies, one can still enjoy themselves by feeling ""involved"".  I found it very hard to relate to the main character.

The film starts with forbidden love between a Thai mafia women named Zin (Ammara Siripong) and a Yakuza (Hiroshi Abe) that results in an autistic baby girl.  The Thai mafia separates the couple and Zin raises the girl, Zen (newcomer JeeJa Yanin).  Zen grows up watching martial arts films and running from flies.  She has an uncanny ability to mimic the intricate moves she sees on the screen, in addition to other skills.  When her mother falls ill and cannot afford the treatment, Zen and her friend find a diary that list many people who owe money to Zin.  Zen then goes about retrieving said cash.

I have been super-geeked about seeing this ever since I watched the trailer last year sometime.  To call it a letdown would be an understatement.  I expected the plot to be crap, so I wasn't too upset about that.  I wanted to see the cool fights that everyone was talking about.  Other than the last 20 minutes of the film, the fights suck.  Zen goes to place after place demanding cash.  She is then laughed at and attacked.  She fights dude after dude until the boss is scared and hands over the money.  These fights consist of being attacked one by one, with every dude throwing one punch (that's so slow a statue could dodge it) before getting kicked in the face.

HOWEVER I will admit that the finale is AWESOME!  The last 20 minutes will induce more than its fair share of cringes as stunt-men earn their money the old-fashioned way:  Brutally!  The whole bag of tricks is emptied here.  Some fantastic Muay Thai moves with a little Tae Kwon Do thrown in.

JeeJa Yanin is more than capable of performing some sweet moves and I can't wait to see her in more stuff.  This, however, I probably could've done without.  The presentation from the Magnolia DVD is stellar with a widescreen picture and the option of an English dub or subtitles.  The special features are limited to a ""making of"" segment.  I may be the only person who doesn't like this movie (as a whole), so please take my review with a grain of salt.  I tried to be objective and move past those pesky expectations I mentioned earlier.  I'm also the ONLY person that didn't like ""Drunken Master"".  2.5 to 3 stars, but the last act is 5-star quality.

3549143,4,B001EBO90G,"Straight out of Thailand comes yet another pulverizing martial arts film to bedazzle the bejesus out of you, and also make you wince in sympathy as dudes get viciously elbowed and kneed in their special places. If you've been suffering from Tony Jaa withdrawal, well, he's not in this one, but the central character here is almost just as good, just as unstoppable, and... is a girl. Jeeja Yanin (a.k.a. Yanin Vismitananda) plays the lead role and, looking at her all girly and petite and unassuming, it's an eye-opener when she begins to demonstrate to sundry hooligans that her kung-fu makes their kung-fu look like patty-cake (but, actually, her predominant discipline seems to be Muay Thai). The film is titled CHOCOLATE, and it is the bonafide shiznit!

At its heart, CHOCOLATE is about a girl who loves her mother. Jeeja Yanin plays Zen, a mildly autistic girl blessed with hyper-acute senses. Her sensitive hearing allows her to pluck out of the air any item hurled at her (and this without her looking, natch!). She's also an uncanny muscle mimic, able to absorb martial arts moves and techniques merely by watching them on television and observing practitoners of the next door kick-boxing academy. In time Zen develops into a fighting virtuoso. She is also crazy about chocolate candy.

To backtrack a bit, Zen's mom - whose name is Zin - had formerly been in a crime syndicate, but then was romanced by a member of the Yakuza. When Zin learned she was pregnant, she decided to go straight and also break up with her lover. Raising an autistic child is tremendously challenging, and it didn't get easier for Zin when years ago she decided to take in a chubby street urchin named Moom, who would grow up to be Zen's honorary big brother.

Cut to the present, where life could be better. We learn that Zin had contracted a form of cancer but is unable to afford the expensive treatments. One day Moom stumbles into Zin's old accounts book which lists the names of people she used to shake down for money. Moom, desperate to help out and not realizing that Zin used to be crooked, assumes that these names still owe Zin money and off he goes to collect, taking Zen along. The debtors naturally aren't too eager to pony up and they dismiss the two teens, which is the wrongest wrong move they could've gone for. It's at this stage that we find out that Zen the autistic girl can seriously layeth down the smack.

CHOCOLATE is a low down, gritty film. We've seen this same lack of polish before in director Prachya Pinkaew's other ventures&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-The-Thai-Warrior/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior</a>&nbsp;and TOM YUM GOONG (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000I0RNWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>), and their flaws ultimately didn't matter a bit, not when Tony Jaa was off doing his brilliant thing (and, by the way, the ONG-BAK 2 trailer looks all kinds of good). So forget about CHOCOLATE's perfunctory plot, forget the lazy script, the rawness of the filmmaking. And also that it takes about half an hour for this thing to get going. This movie instead hangs its rep and its watchability on two things, intrinsically linked: the bone crunching fight scenes and she who serves up all that bone-crunching, newcomer Jeeja Yanin, who was 24 years old when CHOCOLATE came out in 2008. While the overall acting won't impress a cast of a middle school play, it turns out that Jeeja Yanin, putting aside the action stuff, does well even in the more introspective moments. I don't know too much about autism, so I'm not sure how believable she is as an autistic girl, but her performance made me like her and care about what happens to her. The actress (Ammara Siripong) who plays her mom is also good, although I did think that giving her character cancer may have been too contrived a way for the film to try to gain her even more sympathy with the audience.

There's a certain repetitiveness to how the film introduces Zen to her fighty fights (she starts out demanding money for her mom but always ends up violently encroaching the personal space of various goons). Basically that's the bare bones plot, there basically to string together a series of jaw-dropping smackdowns, each one progressively escalating in magnitude and audacity. Showcase sequences number brutal beatdowns in an icehouse (in which Zen channels Bruce Lee) and in a slaughterhouse, which offers up some funny bits. Near the end, there's the showdown featuring Zen taking on wave after wave of baddies, including a deadly glasses-wearing kid with some sort of neurological disorder. But the showstopper is the final sequence, which takes place on a series of high-up, very narrow ledges, first on elevated train tracks, then on a building overlooking a steep drop. As revealed in the 9-minute Making Of featurette and during the film's closing credits, those stunts generated some very real, very painful injuries. Jeeja Yanin is not easy on her stuntmen and, because Jeeja herself does her own stunts, she accrues her own share of hurt. She spent two years training in gymnastics and kickboxing to prep for this film, and then two additional years of training while CHOCOLATE was being shot. So it's no surprise that Jeeja Yanin is able to sell her fight scenes, makes you believe that this little bit of girl can take out mean-intentioned heavies slinging meat cleavers and swords. She's no Tony Jaa... but, seriously, do you really wanna run into her in a dark alley and you don't have her momma's money? Hells to the no!",1236124800,2,5740,5.06984126984127
