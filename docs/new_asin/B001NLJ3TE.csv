3719528,5,B001NLJ3TE,"These shows are funny, quick and keep you entertained. It's great watching them without the commercials, which makes it much more enjoyable. Makes me wish they still had good comedy on nighttime TV now. Unfortunately, they don't so we have to go to the archives and watch the good stuff!",1305763200,,287,4.76
3719529,5,B001NLJ3TE,"I gave my youngest daughter season 1,2 & 3 for Christmas this past year.

I remember watching ""NIGHT COURT"" when I was growing up and into my early adulthood, it was always entertaining!

A few years ago, it came on late nights on TVLAND, it was summertime, so my youngest daughter would stay up late and watch it with me. She LOVED it!

I was excited when the prices fell, for a short while, and I was able to purchase these for her.

Wednesday nights are the only evenings our entire family is in one place, just after Christmas we started watching her DVD's and we finished all 3 seasons within a few weeks!!

I'm waiting for season 4 to come down in price, but it doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.

For a great family night at home with pizza and fries, I highly recommend 'NIGHT COURT""!!!",1298073600,2,802,4.348993288590604
3719530,5,B001NLJ3TE,"In short, I loved it. One of the best American sitcoms, funny, engaging, clever script, fine direction and a brilliant cast.
You wouldn't guess it was first aired in the eighties, but for missing cell phones and laptops.
Amazon delivered reliably, down under, as always.
Re-mastering is excellent, great colours and clear sound - in PAL.
I hope the rest of the seasons will follow soon. Highly recommended!",1281312000,,406,4.985294117647059
3719531,4,B001NLJ3TE,"Nigh Court was one of the Best sitcoms of the 80's.
This season 1+2 combo pack is a good deal.
I did experience some playback issues with a few episodes near the beginning of season 1. By playing the disc on my computer, I was able to view all the episodes.
As with many shows, the first season was a sort of ""Warm-up"" period, where the actors get comfortable with their characters, and with each other. There were numerous cast changes throughout the seasons of Night Court, but the central players kept it all together.
Judge Harry Stone, Dan Fielding, Bull, and Selma were perfect, as well as some excellent guest performers, like Michael J Fox as a Juvenile Delinquent, and Brent Spiner's hilarious portrayal of a Country Bumpkin. Nothing on T.V. today compares to the quality of this show that tickles your Funnybone while tugging at your Heartstrings .",1276473600,3,858,4.726666666666667
3719532,4,B001NLJ3TE,"I always liked ""Night Court"", it was one of those few off-beat comedies like ""Green Acres"", ""Barney Miller"" & ""Taxi"" which introduced really quirky characters which are missing from today's banal offerings. It's really good to have these first 2 series on DVD.",1274572800,,260,5.069767441860465
3719533,4,B001NLJ3TE,Night Court is a great series very funny. There are laughs every 5 mins. The only sour spot is that the case for season two was crushed and one disc damaged although playable it is still damaged.,1246838400,,195,4.297297297297297
3719534,5,B001NLJ3TE,"I LOVE Night Court! The DVD's are fantastic. All this set is is the Season 1 box set and the Season 2 box set shrink wrapped together, so if you're eventually going to get both seasons, you might as well get both now as it's cheaper to buy them together. The only extra on the DVD's is a short interview with Harry Anderson and the creator of the show. It's short, but nice to watch. I hope that later seasons are released soon!",1239753600,2,428,4.168674698795181
3719535,1,B001NLJ3TE,"Lets read the choices on this page:
Night Court Season 1 $16.49
Night Court Season 2 $19.99
But, buy both together and pay $42.99, or only $6.51 MORE than what one would pay by buying the two sets separately.
$19.99 + $16.49 = $36.48. $42.99 - $36.48 = $6.51.

So, I have to ask, are the 34% who supposedly buy this overpriced two pack just bad at basic arithmetic, or what ?",1233187200,13,375,4.208333333333333
3719536,5,B001NLJ3TE,"I have only recently started watching Night Court and actually had never seen it before ordering it (it was a Christmas present for my dad who used to watch it faithfully when it first aired), and I love it already. I had never even heard of this show until seeing a YouTube clip that showed one of Brent Spiner's appearances on the show as Bob Wheeler (Brent Spiner later went on to play Lieutenant Commander Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation). It is an extremely funny show and, while there is some subject matter that would not be appropriate for younger viewers, it is much cleaner than a lot of the shows that are made now and does not rely on offensive language or comments to be considered funny.",1389052800,,708,4.453846153846154
3719537,5,B001NLJ3TE,The whole series is fun to watch. The characters are funny and the episodes are funnier. I can't wait to buy the next season.,1381449600,,125,4.25
3719538,5,B001NLJ3TE,Ok who dosent like this show. Would suggest anyone thats a night court lover to buy these movies. There great!,1380326400,,110,4.55
3719539,5,B001NLJ3TE,"If you lit the old Tv shows then you will love night court it is funny and there is lots
of comady",1370476800,,98,3.5
3719540,5,B001NLJ3TE,"This was comedy at it's absolute best. There was no swearing, no offensive language and even the sexual innuendos of Dan Fielding was always in good taste and good adult humor. It proved what Red Skelton believed years ago; that you don't need a bunch of four letter words to really make people laugh. So much so that it is comedy the whole family can enjoy. I sent a copy to my youngest son who is 26 now, (it was with my eldest son that I used to watch this with and there is an 8 year difference between the two) and he had to admit to me that ""Okay Pop, Night Court is pretty darn funny""!
Chalk another one up for the ol' man!
If you like to laugh, if you like to laugh together with the kids and the whole family, if you like good clean laughter and just hanging out for a half an hour at a time with some good people who want nothing more than for you to enjoy yourself, buy Night Court. Buy Night Court now and you can thank me later!",1360540800,,941,4.01063829787234
3719541,4,B001NLJ3TE,Night court is a really funny sitcom and I am glad I found seasons one and two at such a great price.,1354665600,,101,3.6363636363636362
3719542,5,B001NLJ3TE,"Enjoyed the beginnings of this show that I had long since forgotten. Especially loved seeing the now famous, who had an early start on this show. Looking forward to the next season!",1349568000,,181,4.6875
3719543,5,B001NLJ3TE,"This show is in the same mold as Barney Miller: politically incorrect, a lot of weird and off-the-wall characters, and it revolves around the criminal justice system in NYC. And like Barney Miller, it took place during a rather tumultuous time in NYC. And it brings back a lot of memories to this reviewer, many of them fond ones. My favorite episodes from Season 1 are ""Harry and the Rock Star"" in which Harry dates a punk rocker after they appear on a TV talk show, and ""Bull's Baby"" in which Bull's neighbor entrusts him with her baby and then runs away for a few days. My Season 2 faves are ""Pick a Number"" in which a meek gentleman with a winning lottery ticket entrusts Harry to give the winnings to a worthy recipient, and ""Nuts About Harry"" in which a group of patients from a mental institution are brought before Harry after they are arrested for disorderly conduct and for stiffing a cabbie.",1336521600,,902,4.5060975609756095

8327285,3,B001NLJ3TE,"I watched this series years ago, and I thought it was pretty good. As an adult, I know find it a little ""preachy"". Plus they belabor the point way too long. Sometimes shows get better as the series progresses.",1521072000,,209,4.384615384615385

Something we thought was odd was that only one of the DVD cases has a cardboard sleeve over it. But that's not really a problem. We just thought it was strange :/",1392249600,,381,3.8974358974358974
