8366692,3,B002E1KKRG,"This collection, while cheap, does not contain many gems at all. however, there are a few worth watching. The title list on the back is horrible and useless, so i made my own. Mostly comprised of random episodes of 3 or 4 old serials (US version of Sherlock holmes, Ace Drummond, The clutching hand, and a hacked up couple of episodes from ""tales from the hollywood hills.""  Also, note that although the cover lists Robert De Niro, he only has a very small role in one film. The sherlock holmes series is good, has terrible quality video which renders it nearly unwatchable. Also, it is easily available for purchase, as it is quite popular. so do yourself a favor and just watch the serials on the internet archive ([...]) where all the episodes are free.  I included summaries and ratings from imdb.com

After completing 13 Television Spectaculars, Rex Maynard, a Sinatra like singer, goes on vacation. He also decides to elope with his producer's daughter to Africa! Stephen Boyd, the producer, stages a fake kidnapping to scare Rex off from his daughter and make publicity for his television spectaculars. All is under control until Rex Maynard, who was also a former stuntman, escapes, using his Stuntman Skills. But the coast of South Africa isn't clear yet! REAL kidnappers decide to grab Rex and it gets out of control! Then we find out who Rex can trust and can't trust. Even his wife is involved some how. But can the Manipulator manipulate the situation to save the day? Who doesn't want to be Rex Maynard? Michael Kirner gives a very realistic performance as a man who's been kidnapped many times in one day. Stephen Boyd is great as The Manipulator. I'm only sorry to see this series did not take off. It would be great to see him put his Stuntman/singer through more adventure. There are lots of side stories going on to keep the characters fresh and add depth to the story.

1. The Stoolie (1972)
90 min  -  Comedy | Crime
5.3/10

Jackie Mason plays the title role, reminiscent of Dom DeLuise in Fatso. He's a down-on-his-luck nebbish who finds himself in a real jam due thanks to his brother, another loser who wants to be a player. The brother is nervously played to perfection by Don (aka Dan) Frazer, later of Kojak fame. Once Mason's love interest joins the proceedings, the movie seems to lose its initial momentum, and forgets about Frazer until its slapdash ending. The girl is quirky and neurotic enough for a movie of her own. Altogether, this is worth seeing as a time capsule of early Jackie Mason, and a marvelous performance by Don Frazer -- but has few other charms.

1. Mysteries (1978)
97 min  -  Drama | Mystery  -  7 September 1978 (Netherlands)
4.6/10

Based on a novel of the Norwegian Nobel prize-winner, Knut Hamsun, this romantic psychological drama takes place during the last century and depicts a wealthy mysterious traveller, Johan Nagel (Hauer), who decides to make an extended stay in a small rural town. He becomes the immediate friend and protector of the town's much-abused midget (played wonderfully by David Rappaport), and is tormented by his feelings for two local women -- the beautiful yet spiteful and unattainable Dany Kielland (Sylvia Kristel) and the beautiful and innocent Martha Gude (Rita Tushingham). The movie was shot on location on the Isle of Man, and the picturesque natural scenery throughout adds greatly to the rich atmosphere of the film. (Nature is a prime element in Hamsun's novels.) As far as the sex goes, there are some suggestive scenes and nudity, but nothing too explicit. It's mostly left to the imagination, which is nice (quite unlike most Dutch films I've seen). The acting I thought was first-rate, and Rutger Hauer is well-cast as the unfathomable Johan Nagel. It was interesting to see Hauer in his younger days, before he crossed the Atlantic to follow his career in Hollywood.

Great Performances (TV series 1972- ) Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson ()
102 min  -  Biography | Comedy | Drama  Original Air Date: 6 November 1987
4.8/10

The original version ""Naticia Jackson"" was part of the series ""Tales from the Hollywood Hills"" and runs 56 minutes. The home video edition called ""Power, Passion and Murders"" combined two episodes from the series (the other episode is ""A Table at Ciro's""). The problem is, that they inter-cut both stories instead to show just one after the other, which is pretty confusing. Try to watch the original, which is an excellent piece about the classic days of Hollywood in the 30's. Michelle Pfeiffer is unbelievable good as the screen goddess Natica Jackson (reminescent of Veronica Lake, Jean Harlow, Rita Hayworth and all the others).

2. The Cold Room (TV 1984)
95 min  -  Drama | Mystery | Romance
5.0/10

A girl brought to modern Germany experiences events that occurred during the World War II era.

This was a made-for-cable affair, but is/was available on VHS. The main and overriding sense one gets in watching this film is, ""Great Scott! Will somebody wake these people up?"" Which is another way of saying it is boring and dreary. But more than that, it seems like the whole production is in some sort of funk. Start with George Segal. I'm a fan. He may be remembered to people now as the guy from ""Just Shoot Me."" But up until the early 80s, the guy was a capital-letters Movie Star, whose main asset was a sense of fun and vigor he brought into the various quirky roles he played. His star was fading when this was made and it is clear why. In THE COLD ROOM, he seems preoccupied, dazed, out of it. Just sad to see a once- vibrant person bring nothing to the table.

But he's not the only one. Pays (Mrs. Corbin Bernson), has little spark to her character. The whole plot involves people in present-day Germany, one of whom discovers a link to a past romance with a character from Germany's Nazi past. It might have helped if Pays (or anyone else) brought a little energy to the set. But since the whole thing is pretty lifeless, directed by the book, scripted with no surprises, etc...the ""who cares"" factor is high. The movie is inoffensive but seems almost intentionally boring. Like the people who made it wanted it to be quickly forgotten.
