2750467,4,B000MV8ATU,"Enjoy the realustic sounds & visual of the campfire &  fireplaces.  The aquarium is fun to watch. Enjoy the little surprise crawlers  that pop out now & again.  Very relaxing to have playing.  Lava is ok-- just not my favorite part of DVD.
Great purchase & price for the enjoyment.",1370649600,5,281,4.54
2750468,5,B000MV8ATU,This is a great substitute for the real thing.  Used at a fundraiser and it added a warm touch to the room.  Just what I wanted.,1297728000,3,128,3.8846153846153846
8172965,1,B000MV8ATU,"This DVD is of very poor quality. All images are grainy looking on a hi def TV. The fish tank is disgusting. It is nothing more than a camera set up filming someone's dirty salt water tank. And the camera angle is horrible, you can see the dirty aquarium filters and even the top of the water. The lava is red on a yellow background. The colors hurt my eyes. The lava option might be ok if you were tripping. ;)",1472428800,,411,4.08641975308642

8172967,5,B000MV8ATU,"This video is awesome! Exactly what I was looking for! I enjoy the noises from the fires, the aquarium is relaxing and the lava is like a classic lava lamp! Great price and fast shipping too! Thank you!",1423872000,,202,4.342105263157895

8172970,3,B000MV8ATU,"Bought this DVD mainly to use as a fireplace on the television during the holidays.  Was PERFECT for that!  Loved using the ""regular"" fireplace video.  However, the campfire and other fireplace just aren't as nice as the regular one.  The lava is too weird to use.. trust me on that.  Looks more like an alien creature trying to get out of the tv.  And the fish tank....I would adore using the fish tank but honestly.... it's an UGLY fish tank!  The only thing it did do was give me a taste of using a fish tank video on our tv.  Now I'm searching for a NICE fish tank video!  To summarize, if you want a nice regular fireplace, this video has a great one!  If you also want a fish tank, look elsewhere.",1421798400,,703,4.2180451127819545
