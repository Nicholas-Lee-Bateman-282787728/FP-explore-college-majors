6516148,5,B00LYHXF8W,"If you know who sion sono is and how his movies are then you can get a very good idea what this is, so i will skip the synopsis or reviews, what i can tell you about this blu ray is that surprisingly there are inside 2 versions of the film, the international cut who everyone saw and the uncut version, which lasts 20 minutes more, that is a lot of stuff in there, basically theres another storyline and its also twisted and perverse. artful and transgressive and i wouldnt take it any other way.",1430524800,6,496,4.231578947368421

8668966,5,B00LYHXF8W,"I don't normally leave reviews, however I feel I must address something about this 'special edition'. I was actually quite surprised about this edition containing two 'versions' of this movie. Even though they are different by a few minutes and editing choices, I must say this movie was far more enjoyable once I watched the Japanese Cut. The Japanese Cut is a much more complete movie as far as story and plot go compared to the International Cut (which I saw shortly after the movie came out some 2 years ago). The International cut, short of completely ignored the ""murder case"" part of the story making it seem like it was just there to ""take up space"", and reduced ""Izumi Kikuchi's"" conflict to the pink-film palatability of ""bored-sexually-frustrated-house-wife-seeks-[insert BS here]"", which was possibly done for the sake of an audience that's into that kind of boring entertainment. Whereas the Japanese Cut takes that angle and looks at it more from the ""Madonna vs Magdalene"" complex that not only the husbands place upon the wives but the wives end up punishing themselves over, with the in-depth presence of the ""murder plot line"". That's not to say that the International Cut is devoid of plot/story/entertainment, but there was something rather incomplete about the first time I watched this movie.",1518652800,,1314,5.059907834101383
8668967,5,B00LYHXF8W,"This is a compelling and engrossing story of a complicated relationship between four individuals  a dutiful housewife, her milk-toast husband, a university professor  and a female criminal investigator who attempts to unravel a gruesome murder, a la the Black Delila, the end product of their toxic encounter of the first three. All lead double lives.

This movie is the second installment of a trilogy in which Sono comments on contemporary Japanese life.  Those issues all center on the desire, if not need, to please a partner in a close relationship, fidelity and the destruction of that persons trust. These issues involved are not limited to Japanese society at all. While these are real-life concerns common in most, if not all, countries, there is a lot unsaid and unstated in how the characters interact which is probably specific for that time and place.

Director Sono has the great ability to amplify those deeply held human needs to where it is sometimes difficult to watch, although sometimes he lapses into melodrama.

Still, nothing in this movie is what it appears to be for the characters involved. This is especially dangerous in settings where appearances are everything, and the results end up disastrously here. The complex interactions of these double lives require repeated watching to receive its full effect, but once understood is something that will stay with you for days.

Five Stars!!",1496275200,2,1415,5.126086956521739
8668968,4,B00LYHXF8W,"A studied and at times a wild ride into depravity. The ""story"" is more the setting than the tale... providing stage where scenarios expose each character to be more capable and dangerous than initially portrayed. The writing is often camp in trying to elevate poetry to mysticism along with other repetitious stereotypes. Still, there is enough power within the actors to float the run time. An entertaining, quirky and sexy crazy-quilt.",1488585600,2,437,5.169014084507042
8668969,5,B00LYHXF8W,"Wow. I was blown away with this one. This is another part of a trilogy Sion Sono did along with Love Exposure and Coldfish. All three of these movies may be his best work, even better than Suicide Circle, which was the first Sion Sono movie was exposed to. As all Sion Sono films dive into different aspects of Japanese culture, usually ""dark"" aspects of it, Guilt of Romance dives into sexuality, love hotels, and the sexual lives of women in a patriarchal society. There is a lot of pain in the movie, and some deep explorations of how women can become hurt in such a crazy world as well. Highly recommended.",1481155200,2,610,4.455357142857143

8668973,5,B00LYHXF8W,"Excellent film with some really good actors which explores in typical Sion Sono's provocative style the concepts of evil, sexuality, social norms and mores in the context of a very hypocritical society. Remarkable performances by the excellent (and beautiful) three female leads. Highly original, thought-provoking and sexy. What more can you ask for in a film? Sono and his excellent cast of actors deserve to be better known.",1444262400,10,427,5.294117647058823
