7985262,4,B00008LDZX,"I love Leslie Sansone and I already have alot of her videos...if you have a bad back it's a good easy work out if you do the 1 mile ones.

I bought this video thinking great...she now has one for abs...cool...but I didn't realize that I need an ab belt to do this exercise. But that's ok...I just act like I have one and still do the movements.",1173312000,2,344,4.0588235294117645
7985263,5,B00008LDZX,"I have been using Leslie Sansone's other Walk Away the Pounds videos with the 2 pound weights for over a year and love them.  The WATP series for ABS is also wonderful.  The pace is faster and the belt really adds another dimension to the program - you definitely see results.  Don't think just your ABS will benefit from these videos - you will see results in your arms, legs, and abs!",1073001600,,386,4.333333333333333
