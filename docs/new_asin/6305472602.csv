Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; cinematography = 4.5 stars; score = two (2) stars.  Director Masaki Kobayashi's Parts III and IV of the overly-contrived adventures of a fish-out-of-water protagonist.  The Director's initial film (Parts I and II) dealt with a left-wing radical college student pitted (no pun) against the management of a conservative coal mining company brutally operating a huge open pit mine in Manchuria (no surprise as to who prevails, of course).  This time out, Kobayashi pits the de facto Communist against the Japanese Army in Manchuria!  A masochistic photo play that seems bent on driving home the message that war is hell, but the brutality of gang wars in army barracks is just as bad (or even worse!).  It is painfully (no pun) obvious that the Director is trying to squeeze as many vignettes from the source material (a massive contemporary novel) as his production budget will allow into the movie, since one micro dramatic event randomly follows another (usually bridged with fade outs).  The result is that Part III is way too long and just plain boring.  Part III is also crammed with repetitious bouts of face slapping and beatings (mostly in the barracks) which seems to comprise the major part of training for new recruits.  (A lot of the heavy-duty face slapping looks to be real--and stunt actors do not appear to have been used!)  Part IV (also loaded with face slapping) is less than exciting until the Soviets declare war and launch an impressive tank attack against a pitifully trained and under equipped Japanese Army (the Japanese are shown to lack war machinery, machine guns, automatic rifles, and even ammunition--but they do have shovels and know how to slap faces!).  There is no intermission this time. (Perhaps the producers were fearful of the audience not returning for Part IV?)  Once again, Kobayashi fills the screen with many hard-to-swallow oddities beyond the usual David and Goliath plot.  My favorites include:  the many face-slapping rifts on classic Three Stooges shorts including slapping Army nurses; frequent dialog references to ""The Front"" which is never defined and begin way before the Soviet declaration of war and their invasion; near drowning in a puddle-sized ""lake""; the extraordinary power of ancient Confucian principles (of absolute obedience to higher authority) to prevent well-deserved mutinies (perhaps not a real oddity?); and the ludicrous power of romantic love which causes a bride to leave college in Tokyo, move to a Manchurian pit mine, and STAY THERE after her husband has been drafted!  Acting is perfunctory and often melodrama, since the majority of lines are delivered by shouting (which quickly becomes tedious).  Characters are often hard to differentiate except in close-ups (which seem under used), as they are costumed and made-up to look pretty much indistinguishable in medium and long shots.  Actress Michiyo Aratama delivers a disappointingly limp cameo performance even though she would seem to have free reign as the sole leading actress (there are two other actresses playing very minor roles).  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are excellent.  Restoration is excellent.  Subtitles/translations are OK.  Aside from the opening credits, the score seems to have been recycled from the initial film and is injected when least appropriate.  A scene distracter rather than an enhancer.  Not particularly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1469923200,,3767,5.224625623960066

7890878,5,6305472602,"The acting is inspiring, the script gut-wrenchingly convincing and the cinematography on a par with that of other Japanese classics. This three-part series tells it like it was without cliches and the impact is restrained enough to last for three hours in each episode. Kaji, an idealistic Japanese man with socialist inclinations is embroiled in the fascist culture of WWII Japan. His struggle as a conscientious objector has universal overtones: the conflicts between mass mania and personal integrity, between nationalistic tribalism and humanistic sensitivity, between the pack mentality of bullying and the vulnerability of someone who stands up for what is right.",1092873600,12,669,5.568627450980392
