5424743,5,B00AHA5RVK,"Strawinsky and the mysterious house is one of the most enlightening children's stories of all time, with it's deeply motivated characters and heavy Christian subtexts. In watching this movie you find both cunning suspense and heavy Christian subtext.
  In seeing the humble animation, you are reminded of Jesus' words telling us to not exceeding what you need. We see beautiful backgrounds with characters so bland that it truly gives you a contrast for what we  should be more like and how amazing the world is when we aren't so self centered.
  We are allowed to see the sins of 3. Two returned to their master, the other leaving behind his morals and faith because of fear and uncertainty. It is made clear through the other 2 however, that whence you abandon God that you will face consequences. The Globglogabgolab does not regain his beauty, even though he changes his mind. He already made the mistake, and there was no going back. Returning may have helped him gain entrance to the castle, but he would never regain his good looks and dashing smile. In my personal opinion however, I was somewhat aroused by the nature of his fantastic artistry and folds of fat. I would like to see a sequel about him :)

5424758,3,B00AHA5RVK,"A fortnight ago I found myself traversing through the throngs of the Amazon in Prime. It was a dreary day, the wind howling through the marvelous hardwood forests surrounding my cottage. Sometime in the night, one of the aforementioned hardwood trees was stricken with a bolt of electricity coursing through the atmosphere. It fell atop my cottage, not damaging it thankfully, but it was a thunderous impact. As a result, I received quite a start. It was then, that through this series of events, fate had found me. All was a blur. The noise. The start. The fear as my world came crumbling down around me. Through this unfortunate series of events, I seemed to have spilled my glass of water all over the floor. Do not blame me for I received a fright, I feel I've made that clear.

After I promptly cleaned up the mess, I saw it. On my computer screen, was this moving picture. Naturally, my interest was piqued as it had been many, many years since I found myself the pleasure of viewing a Shrek motion picture. From there I proceeded to click the ""view now"" button, with a bowl of the finest popcorn in hand. Do not ask from where the popped corn came, for I do not know. It had just appeared. Perhaps it knew the finest pleasure a popped corn could have, is to be consumed during the viewing of a Shrek.

Throughout the motion picture, I found myself confused. My mind was in a kerfuffle. My wiener was raw and not the desired 12 inches, but rather 11. I was already upset regarding my undersized schlong, so this motion picture was the equivalent to a jousting lance in the face. I do recognize that it would be woefully unfair to consider the unrelated events in my life as it pertains to my review to this motion picture so I would like to complete my review free of outside influences.

Firstly, I would admit this to be one of the weirder of the Shrek sequels. I found it awkward to see Fiona forego her signature green dress in favor of a velvety red gown. Even stranger was her new desire for slavery, perhaps she has an electra complex? Besides I believe the plot point of the ogres turning to humans was done perfectly in the first Shrek sequel, however I loved the fresh spin they introduced by turning Shrek into a troll and donkey into a beaver rather than the previous human and white stallion.

The message I will admit could be easily lost behind the fun exterior for the lesser of viewers. Regardless it spoke to me more than any other Shrek picture, except possibly the third of the sequels, where Shrek left the beehive and fell in love with a human woman.

I would not recommend it due to my 11 inch wiener. You fair people of Amazon in Prime deserve better.",1520640000,46,2681,4.441056910569106
