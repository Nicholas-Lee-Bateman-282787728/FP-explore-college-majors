8456424,2,B00547N0IS,"I especially enjoyed the first Version I purchased back in 2010.  But, this year, I loaned it to a friend and later when I found that it could be purchased again I gave it to her as a gift. I then purchased this DVD most recently thinking that I was getting the same version as before  but find that this most recent DVD is some what different, in that, there were to many exclusions. This version is more like a collage of scenes therefore, I giving it a poor rating.  If you happen to come across the old version that made sense please contact me.",1394755200,3,549,4.20952380952381
