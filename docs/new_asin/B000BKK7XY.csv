She show you by real life events that took place in her life.  You will say, ""oh, I did that.""
So Laugh!!",1355788800,3,227,3.6122448979591835
8205496,5,B000BKK7XY,"I love listening to Joyce Meyer and have heard her tell stories during her telecast so I bought this DVD with that in mind. I was not disappointed. You will laugh from beginning to end. She does tie this all in with her own experiences and what you should do as well according to what God wants you to do. What I love is that most of the stories of her own life are played out by actors, which are very good. I cant wait for a sequel.",1283299200,9,434,3.9431818181818183
