I bought these for my handicapped wife who is not as concerned as I about quality and aspect ratio and ll that. But the quality is well worth the price. And they ARE funny!",1364428800,9,299,4.454545454545454
3555339,5,B001EKP5DC,"I bought this set primarily to get The Awful Truth. I had seen it once on TV, and was amazed at how fresh and funny it is. Sometimes, older movies seem slow and dated, but The Awful Truth is fast and witty. Irene Dunne could give Tina Fey a few lessons on comedy timing. Cary Grant is no slouch, either. And who knew Ralph Bellamy could be so funny? A great classic comedy, in the same vein as Bringing Up Baby...but no leopard.

I only watched Born Yesterday...well, yesterday. It hasn't held up as well, but you can see why Judy Holliday won the Oscar for it.

I haven't watched His Girl Friday yet, but it is on everybody's list for top cinema comedies.",1361491200,,656,4.282258064516129

3555341,5,B001EKP5DC,"Marriage and divorce are the common themes in this package of feature films, all of which made the New York Times list of Best 1000 Movies Ever Made (St. Martin's Griffin, $24.95). Each comes with its own art work embossed on the disk, some come with a bevy of extra features.

Born Yesterday
  Judy Holliday won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Billie Dawn in this 1950 film combining comedy, drama, and in Broderick Crawford's depiction of tycoon Harry Brock, a thuggish portrayal of those who arrive in Washington with other than honorable intentions.

  Billie begins the film with an utter daffiness, a walk that approaches a waddle, and a siren wail that could have influenced The Honeymooners. William Holden is nurturing as reporter Paul Verrall, hired to refine Billie and make her more palatable to the Washington establishment Brock seeks to bribe.  Billie awakens amid the monuments that are Washington's signature, and Verall is so successful cultivating her, Billie teaches a Congressman his first responsibility is to advocate for the people, although she does this deftly, never descending into preachy moralizing. But she  pays a price for her conversion.  At one point, refusing to rubber stamp Brock's corporate decisions any longer, insisting on understanding them on her own terms, she is beaten for her recalcitrance.  The descent from comedy, to tension, to horror happens so quickly and convincingly viewers can only marvel at Ms. Holliday's ability to brilliantly convey the emotional content.  A strong story line makes her recovery plausible; the cinematography and restoration yield a rich film print 60 years later.

  William Holden fans will barely recognize him 25 years before Network, although the theme based argumentative style that made him famous is present in this earlier effort.

His Girl Friday
  Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell get the lion share of credit for the repartee that spices this 1939 story about a newspaper editor trying to win back his ex-wife and at the same time, free a man sent to prison. The sets contribute mightily to the film's success and its continuing appeal.  The symbolic weight of a stand alone middle of the room prison cell won't be lost on audiences conditioned to Silence Of The Lambs, although instead of incarcerating a cannibal, an ordinary (and by the end of the film, innocent) man inhabits the prison cell while petitioning for pardon.
  The dialogue really is smart and witty but that isn't the script's only compelling feature.  The sheer amount of words the actors had to memorize, along with their rapid fire delivery will astonish contemporary audiences used to movies with minimalist dialog.  Tabloid journalism gets skewered in this film as beat reporters convene like birds of prey waiting for news of the impending execution.  The film takes on absurdist, anything-can-happen overtones as an escape plot is hatched, but Grant and Russell keep things on track as they discover in their zeal for a story, they complement and attract.  The restored film print is snappy and glitch free.

The Awful Truth
  Mistrust and deceit characterize the relationship between Jerry (Cary Grant) and Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne) in their collaboration with director Leo McCarey, who won an Academy Award for Best Director with this film.  There were other Grant/McCarey collaborations to follow, most notably An Affair To Remember (1957).

  Divorce on a dare is the outcome of a taunting episode between the couple.  Each is determined to acquire the lion's share of the marital estate which includes custody of their irascible canine, Mr. Smith.  Smitty's loyalties are hopelessly divided, the struggle to control the dog is followed by attempts to undo the new romances of the former partners.  Each new attempt at madcap meddling has riotous consequences and it's a war of attrition that develops until both realize there is no one else they'd rather be with.  Cary Grant's buffoonery is genuinely outrageous; he made Depression era audiences laugh, Irene Dunne made them care.",1304467200,6,4059,5.135670731707317

""The Awful Truth"" has absolutely hilarious skits and will keep you entertained.

3555354,5,B001EKP5DC,"Three absolutely terrific comedies.  We bought it primarily for Born Yesterday and Judy Holliday's brilliant performance.  However, Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday are wonderful.  You can rarely beat Cary Grant's comic chops in just about any film he made.  The timing and rapid-fire dialogue in ""Friday"" are pretty amazing, and Irene Dunne's handling of the telephone call from Grant's fianc is sublime false naivet.  I would be remiss in not giving high marks to Broderick Crawford in ""Yesterday,"" too.

We wanted to get Born Yesterday, but came across this for only a couple of bucks extra.  Such a deal!  Glad we did.  Three great films we'll watch many times over.",1464220800,3,708,4.932203389830509

THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937), after several viewings now my favorite of the three, stars Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in this cockeyed rom-com of separation and reconciliation.  Ralph Bellamy as the hick from out of town is a sketch.  BORN YESTERDAY (1950) is the adapted play so good it got the Oscar nod for Judy Holliday's portrayal of a not-so-dumb corrupt businessman's girlfriend.  William Holden is her idealistic tutor; Broderick Crawford the heavy.  HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1940) is a co-ed version of THE FRONT PAGE, with Cary Grant the corner-cutting newspaper editor and Rosalind Russell cast against type as the fast-talking reporter suckered back in for ""just one more interview.""  Ralph Bellamy is great as the naive fiance who crosses paths with a girl masher.  All top-notch entertainment.",1508544000,15,840,5.223880597014926

I know she won the Oscar for Born Yesterday, mainly because of two legendary actresses (Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson) splitting the vote giving what would have been the third place winner, Judy. But I am glad she won, this is a legendary performance by a great actress who was taken from us too soon. Katharine Hepburn saw her potential when Judy played a supporting role in Adam's Rib and made sure that Judy's scenes were not tampered with in the editing room. I have seen all of her films and wish she would have lived longer, her last film was Bells are Ringing. She is one of my five favorite actresses.",1499126400,,730,4.455223880597015
