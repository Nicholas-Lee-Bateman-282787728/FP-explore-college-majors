8348177,5,B001YU40YM,"I owned this on VHS but found it unavailable in New Zealand on DVD.  This is a wonderful DVD. The transfer is fine though it is in mono.  No need to be put off by that.
I've always found it inspirational and was thrilled to discover it was available through Amazon.  This was my first purchase from Amazon. The order was sent directly by Hebrew World in Scottsdale and arrived at my postal address in New Zealand 6 days after I placed the order. Thank you so much, all at Amazon.",1279152000,4,479,4.241758241758242
