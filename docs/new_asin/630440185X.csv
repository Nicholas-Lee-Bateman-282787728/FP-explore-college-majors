877554,4,630440185X,We already had this film for along time on vcr but this wasn't good anymore. We like this type of movie en in perticular performances of Whoopy Goldberg. It's a nice film to watch and inspires you to go uot and play some 9-ball yourself.,1191283200,,237,4.288888888888889
877555,3,630440185X,"A 1989 made for TV movie features a pre-Ghost Whoopi Goldberg playing a single mother who is about to lose her house if she doesn't come up with $7500 in four months.  She has a cloyingly cute and precocious teenage daughter (Tasha Scott) and she works in a diner for two very nice people.  On a visit to her estranged parents, she stops in an old hangout---a billiard parlor and decides the best way to come up with the money is to become a professional billiard player.  She is encouraged in this by a wily promoter, played with his usual aplomb by Dennis Franz.  During one tournament, she meets a handsome playboy, played with regal blandness by Dorian Harewood.  Of course, she falls for the guy but he's not the most loyal of partners, and daughter Tasha doesn't like him too much.  Meanwhile, Franz reveals his feelings for Whoopi which gets him nowhere, and we have the obligatory ten thousand dollar championship in San Francisco where Whoopi is in the finals against loverboy Harewood.  Realizing how hard it is to make a billiard game breathtakingly exciting, the director uses gimmicky multi-image camera shots to try and heighten the non-existent suspense.  You know from the start where this movie will end up and Goldberg's final scene comes out of nowhere, and she ends up with Harewood and not Franz.  Might be an okay family film, but you can do better.",1116460800,5,1371,4.702928870292887

7871325,2,630440185X,"I love Whoopi Goldberg's acting.  All actors were superb in this movie, but the ending is so disappointing - so wrong for 'Sarah Collins' and her daughter, that when re-watched, I will stop the movie before the tournament scenes.  The script is such that it is not predicatable, and then... it deep sixes at the end.",1435449600,,316,4.625

7871329,5,630440185X,"Whoopi brings it to the table (pool table in this instant)... as she portrays a single mother whose balloon house payment takes her back into the game to save her home.  Entertaining to say the least.  Not so much a comedy as is her normal forte.  She still shines, in my humble opinion.  :)",1411862400,,291,4.333333333333333

7871333,5,630440185X,"Apparently this did not hit the mainstream entertainment market,  I enjoyed it because I am into real estate and can appreciate it does not take much to get a home foreclosed.

After talking to town folks finding out it was filmed part in San Jose downtown and Morgan Hill, I talked to the home owners who allowed them film and showed to senior center. Most enjoyed the setting if not Goldberg's sense of humor.",1385164800,,411,4.54054054054054
