8603943,5,B00ECU4LLI,"I have only seen Stealing Christmas when I was younger but it is a good movie. We recently watched The Borrowers for the first time and it was great. It is more of a European or British film cast, but it was really good. It was funny and eventful. The Little People in the Floor Are REAL! Very heartwarming and sad at times. Definitely a family movie.
Great collection.",1479772800,,369,4.36231884057971
