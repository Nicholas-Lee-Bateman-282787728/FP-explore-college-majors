8088371,5,B000BKVQSY,I absolutely enjoy watching Justine Shapiro. She is my favorite of the travellers. And I love DC. Perfect dvd.,1416960000,,110,4.842105263157895
8088372,1,B000BKVQSY,"Rented this to show to some students who had not gone on the 8th grade Washington, D.C. trip. Imagine my surprise when Shapiro emphasizes the scented oil she's buying, ""Rompe Colchn"", ""Mattress Breaker"" and the camera zooms in on the box featuring a drawing of a couple having sex! Really? We're the ratings for this series dropping? Also, she raves about how ""good looking"" Jefferson and Lincoln were. Even my 8th graders asked why that was important . Disappointing from a usually good series.",1384819200,,495,4.904761904761905
8088373,2,B000BKVQSY,"The material was good, the hostess was TERRIBLE!  Hard to believe someone hired her to be on camera.  Save your $1.99.",1355097600,,118,4.571428571428571
8088374,3,B000BKVQSY,"Informative documentary.  Do not watch with your children.  Has some questionable content (Host is in a store and displays a box with a picture of a couple in flagrante delicto.  She states that product is called Broken Mattress) and words (they are beeped out, but that won't stop your children from asking what she said).",1329696000,4,323,4.836363636363636
8088375,5,B000BKVQSY,"This captures slices of Washington DC that many people have not seen. There are some wonderful ""day trip"" locations such as Williamsburg and a Civil war re-enactment! Very entertaining and beautiful looking too. Enjoy for yourself or gift it to that history buff in your family.",1322524800,,278,5.065217391304348
