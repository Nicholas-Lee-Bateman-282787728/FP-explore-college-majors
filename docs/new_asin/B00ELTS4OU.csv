8606751,4,B00ELTS4OU,"Toast of London is a lot like if some really boring soap style sitcom that would've stared Ian McKellan way back when got a thorough going over by the Mighty Boosh crew. Since Matt Berry is here clearly that's what happened since he runs in the same circles as them when he's not doing his faux retro music. All of that should sound pretty good to anyone.

What I wasn't expecting was how there's a real sadness in this one. It's like they got some script touch ups by Wes Anderson. Matt Berry really knows how to play down on his luck here. A funny combination of pride and British style steel eyed desperation. Clearly, he should've been hired as a particularly loathsome family member for Downton Abbey.

So it's surrealist humor mixed with undercover talented dramatic acting and a great theme song from Matt Berry (Take My Hand from the Withhazel album). Definitely worth tracking down.",1425254400,,891,4.6687898089171975
