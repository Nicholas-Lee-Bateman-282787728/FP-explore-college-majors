3721509,5,B001NPD9RM,"This is a really good and very funny movie! It's perfect for the whole family! It has an awesome plot and great actors. Everbody did an awesome job! Kevin James stars as the lovable and dorky Paul Blart, who works as a Security Guard at West Orange Pavilion Mall. Nobody really likes Paul, except for his daughter and mother. Then, he meets Amy, played by the sexy beautiful Jayma Mays. Amy starts to like him, until he gets drunk at a bar. On Black Friday, criminals disguised as Santa's elves take over the mall and have 6 hostages, Amy included. When Paul finds out about Amy, he takes a stand and fights back against the bad guys. It's like Die Hard for ALL audiences. If you love comedy, you'll love PAUL BLART: MALL COP!!!",1233878400,6,728,4.440298507462686
3721510,1,B001NPD9RM,"This ""movie"" makes me ashamed to be an American.  The only reason I went was because my friends wanted to see it and they had free tickets.  I cannot understand how it has done so well at the box office.  Even the kids in the theater wern't laughing at this turkey.

3721511,3,B001NPD9RM,"What a character, that Paul Blart. Half of me liked him a lot while the other half completely understood why everyone writes him off. He's like a high school kid trying so hard to be popular that he doesn't realize how silly he's making himself look. He takes his job as a mall security guard far too seriously, and this is despite the fact that he really wasn't trained to handle the really tough situations. At the same time, I saw that he's a decent, honest guy who loves his daughter and just wants someone other than a family member loving him back. Who doesn't want that? Still, I wish someone had the guts to walk up to him, grab him by the shoulders, and shake some sense into him. If I were that person, I'd say to him, ""Stop trying to be something you're not! For once in your life, just be yourself!""

""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" tells the story of a New Jersey man who, through luck and a series of very improbable circumstances, defends the West Orange Pavilion Mall against a band of armed robbers on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year. The story is not very probable, but then again, it probably wasn't supposed to be. It is rated PG, after all, which automatically suggests that it was intended for a more family-friendly audience. That's fine, I guess, but it would have been nice if screenwriters Kevin James and Nick Bakey had taken the time to create something a bit more memorable; ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" has its heart in the right place, but for all intents and purposes, it isn't worth remembering. Everything just kind of passes before our eyes in a fluffy, innocent flash of comedy.

The title character, played by co-writer Kevin James, is introduced as he fails to complete an obstacle course at the New Jersey State Police Academy. We quickly learn that he suffers from hypoglycemia; when he doesn't have enough sugar in his system, he's liable to pass out and begin snoring. Because his poor health prevented him from becoming a police officer, he's forced to remain a mall security guard, spending hours upon hours gliding past shops and kiosks on a Segway. As passionate as he is about his job, neither his coworkers nor the shoppers think very highly of him. I felt bad, but at the same time, I recognized that he was making himself a very easy target; when you're compelled to give a speeding ticket to an old man driving a scooter, for example, it should come as no surprise that you're not being taken seriously.

Then comes that fateful day after Thanksgiving, when people come out of the woodwork to go Christmas shopping. As it nears closing time, a team of criminals disguised as Santa's elves infiltrate the mall and seize control. The team leader, the classically villainous Veck Sims (Keir O'Donnell), lets all but six people leave the mall. Blart, who too busy playing Guitar Hero to notice either the takeover or the evacuation, eventually realizes what's going on and decides to fight back. This goes against the advice of Sergeant Howard (Adam Ferrara), who, along with the rest of the West Orange police force, is standing outside the mall, awaiting news of the hostage situation. But Blart swore to himself that he would protect the mall and all who are inside it, and by golly, he's going to protect the mall and all who are inside it. Thus begins an amusing but predictable mission to stop the bad guys before they get away with $30 million.

Intertwined with this story is a subplot about Blart's love life, or lack thereof. Ever since his wife left him (for reasons too inconsequential to reveal), he's been lonely and depressed, and he relies on food to numb the pain. His caring mother (Shirley Knight) and loving daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez), do their best to encourage him, even going so far as to help him start a profile page on Match.com. It seems his only hope at finding love is a friendly but distant woman named Amy (Jayma Mays), who works in the mall at a hairpiece kiosk. I could never really tell what she thought about Blart; she clearly doesn't like the man she's dating--an arrogant pen salesman named Stuart (Stephen Rannazzisi)--but she doesn't seem to comfortable around Blart, either. There are moments when it feels like she's being nice just because she pities him. Granted, if I saw a decent man get drunk in a bar and humiliate himself in front of an unassuming mall staff, I'd be anxious around him, too.

That very scene is a perfect example of how desperate the film's sense of humor is. Most of the jokes are aimed at making Blart look like a complete fool. None of them are particularly funny, and the select few that are merely amusing are unflatteringly derivative.

Consider a minor subplot involving a teenage Indian boy named Pahud (Adhir Kalyan); his ex-girlfriend's cell phone was given to Blart (how he got it is unimportant), enabling them to start an odd over-the-phone relationship. This felt incredibly forced, especially when it's revealed that the cell phone is equipped with a tracking device. That being said, I do give the filmmakers credit for not going for the tried and true vulgarities that permeate most of today's comedies. There is a sense that no one wanted to go too far, which in this case is good; this movie certainly didn't need in-your-face gags about sex and drugs and body parts, nor did it need a lot of crude four-letter dialogue. I know the audience it's aiming for, and yet I can't quite bring myself to accept it. ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" may inspire you to smirk once or twice, but it will hardly make you laugh out loud.",1233014400,2,5555,4.640243902439025
3721512,3,B001NPD9RM,"I had my reservations going in to see this one, but it was surprisingly funny and didn't have to use much gross-out, potty humor or profanity that seems to be pervading many comedies these days in attempts to humor people. Instead, there was more slapstick style humor, and while it is the classic lovable loser meets girl scenario (except at the mall) and has its predictable moments, over all it was a pretty decent comedy.

King of Queens star Kevin James plays Paul Blart, a long time mall security guard who is a bit lonely in life because of failed relationships. When he sees a beautiful woman working in the mall, he tries to figure out a way to connect with her, but his awkwardness gets in the way of his progress. Training a new mall security guard isn't what it seems to be, as this supposed high school dropout turns out to be the brains behind a massive robbery and hostage situation. It is up to Paul Blart, the only one who takes his job too seriously, to try and save the day.

The first part of the movie was funny, but some of the gags were awkward at times (trying too hard to be funny). What James brought to the character Blart was kind of a Chris Farley/John Candy kind of persona.  I thought that the later half of the film was better, even though as usual you have to throw reason out the window.

Not too bad of a film, and dare I say, it might even be one you could take a date to see.",1232755200,40,1412,4.237918215613383
3721513,4,B001NPD9RM,"We went to see this and loved it!  It was part boy-meets-girl, part cops & robbers, part ninja stunts, part average-guy-succeeds, part sweet dad, part slapstick, part irony of human relationships, but all funny.  And the music was GREAT!  Went home and immediately signed up to get the sound track when it becomes available.

  If I'm looking for something dark and ponderous, I watch PBS or Ingrid Bergman.  If I'm looking for something factual, I watch a documentary.  If I need to be updated on current events, I watch (or read)the news. But if I need to laugh hard and feel better when I leave, Mall Cop is perfect.

  And the music is just terrific!  Spans time and memories of my past, but is also this-very-minute, 2009.  Can't wait to hear it again!

  Just all depends what you're looking for. . . .",1232755200,29,808,4.545454545454546
3721514,4,B001NPD9RM,"This movie is getting a surprising amount of hate and I don't know why. There is very little in the way of violence, even less in the way of sex and even the gross-out jokes are kept way below what is usually the minimum level for comedies lately. The bad guys get around the mall with mountain bikes, skate boards and by utilizing some impressive parkour moves. Clearly this movie was meant for the PG crowd and in that it succeeds. It's a nice clean family comedy that everyone can attend and enjoy. There were lots of families in the theater when I saw this movie and they all seemed to have a pretty good time. They laughed and giggled and there was very little of the bored chatter you hear sometimes at kids/family movies.

  I was thinking a little about the John Candy movie Summer Rental after I saw this. Candy played a few different roles in films before he did Summer Rental but that movie is where you see the classic John Candy affable lug character that kind of served as a template for most of his following roles. His characters were usually some variation of that, he did it well and people loved it. Kevin James has a similar likable quality and I'm hoping that maybe he picks up the Easy Going Good Guy mantle where John Candy left it.

  To paraphrase Paul Blart himself, ""Don't write this movie off.""  Like I said, there were plenty of scenes that had both kids and adults laughing together. Isn't it worth at least the price of a matinee ticket to laugh for a while with your kids?",1232323200,93,1504,4.388489208633094
3721515,3,B001NPD9RM,"I saw Mall Cop because My Bloody Valentine was sold out. I didn't expect much from a Happy Madison movie. But I was surprised how hard it made me laugh.

  After Chuck and Larry, you'd think Kevin James would have stayed away from Happy Madison movies. But he was smart to make this one because it was the one out of there 10 or 15 movies that was actually funny.

  In the beginning there's a lot of good laughs supplied by Kevin James. He's funny through-out but the movie gets a little overly goofy towards the end. Still, it's a fun comedy version of a Die Hard type movie. Kevin James should stay away from the Adam Sandler company though, he's funny enough not to need Sandler to get an acting job. I mean, he's not.... Rob Schneider.",1232064000,5,740,4.326086956521739

it was predicatable, but cool, not moive of year and better than lot of the othr dum moive sthis year liek  disaster movie epic movie,, again it was decent, the first  30 mintues to me was a littel slwo getting started",1232064000,2,606,3.808
3721517,3,B001NPD9RM,"Plot holes, pointless characters, and wasted opportunities abound in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, yet Kevin James' blend of fat jokes and hilarious physical comedy deftly masks story shortcomings to leave the viewer with a general sense of comedic satisfaction.  The humor rarely shifts beyond immature gags and the burly comic smashing into things, but for those not expecting supremely intelligent laughs, Blart consistently delivers more smiles than grimaces.

Overweight, hypoglycemic, Segway-riding mustachioed mall cop Paul Blart (Kevin James) dreams of becoming a state trooper, but meanwhile dedicates himself to keeping a New Jersey mall safe from belligerent customers and speeding motorized carts.  Craving respect, Blart receives none, especially from his co-workers and many of the outlet employees.  But when the mall is taken over by a violent criminal and his gang of skateboarding mercenaries, Blart must utilize all of his cunning and determination to save the mall and rescue the hostages.

Although Paul Blart is moronic beyond standard comedy film reasoning, for a PG film, it works. The loopholes, plot gaps and bits and pieces that simply make no sense are quickly forgotten when Kevin James takes a fall. Much of the humor is physical, and James isn't afraid to make fun of his weight. Slapstick, especially in contemporary comedies, is easily faulty - but watching a fatuous fat man continually embarrass himself by falling on the floor rarely grows tiresome, and Kevin James has all but perfected this comedic style.

It's essentially a rip on Die Hard, except the villain is incomparably pathetic, and of course the violence is at a minimum. The inclusion of skateboarding thugs and bicycling henchmen (who perform all sorts of extreme indoor stunts) is a huge step in the wrong direction - it adds nothing to the comedy, and feels like the filmmakers were trying entirely too hard to keep things hip. It subsequently makes the film more childish than it is. Immaturity and idiocy are no stranger to Mall Cop, but with Kevin James contributing to the script, there's definitely a saving dosage of his mostly-appealing brand of humor. It's certainly no masterpiece, but audiences will probably find themselves more amused than they expected.

This movie takes you into the shoes of Paul Blart, a hard working mall cop who is going through a rough time in his life. His wife had divorced him and he begins the movie looking for a new romantic partner who is female. I was emotionally moved by the witty phrase ""scooba-dooby-doo."" The soundtrack is the cherry on top of the award winning acting. Watch as you experience the struggles of a modern day hypoglycemic man as he triumphs over challenges and hurdles to save his daughter and his female romantic interest. And it has twists and turns to really draw you in to each individual scene, keeping you at the edge of your seat just waiting for the next surprise. The attention to detail is phenomenal, nothing is on accident, every frame and every motion is conveyed with extreme emotion.

3721750,2,B001NPD9RM,"The marketing for Mall Cop implies it's a comedy, but it's really a romance movie. As long as you watch this movie with the expectation that it's a romance movie above all else, of a guy who works at the mall as a mall cop and falls in love with a woman working at a midway sales stand, you might like it. I watched this one expecting it would be a funny comedy with a big focus on Blart spending most of the movie getting into comical hijinks that would be funny.

For contrast, I prefer the clumsy comedy of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau of the Pink Panther. He's oblivious to his stupidity and clumsiness, so it's hilarious to watch as he accidentally knocks his boss over the railing and continues to proceed as if nothing happened. Kevin James in Mall Cop doesn't have that style of humor, even though that approach would've helped this film set in a mall, where all kinds of comedy can happen, be a winning comedy.

The concept is there, but the execution ignores all of the heavy marketing that implied this would be a hilarious comedy, and spends way too much time with Blart trying to find ways to win his new love interest that just aren't funny. One example is of Blart sitting in a restaurant thinking about how he's going to impress her. Nothing stands out as funny, as it's all handled in a very dry, realistic, non comical approach. As a romance movie, it's okay but as a funny comedy, this is best seen as ""what could've been funny"" if it had a different comedian in the title role and a funny script.",1449273600,,1521,4.390070921985815

To you critics that think that SEX, BAD LANGUAGE, NUDITY must be in a film to make it worth while to watch, then your brain is rotted. To prove this point I'll just bet I will get a lot of rebuttal. I give honest opinions about movies I have seen and own.

3721883,3,B001NPD9RM,had a few moments,1438905600,,17,3.5
3721884,1,B001NPD9RM,"There's nothing right about this atrocious festival of complete stupidity and absolutely everything wrong with it.  Let's start with the title, Paul Blart: Mall Cop.  It automatically sounds like a terrible b-movie with no focus or point to its plot what-so-ever.  And if I had a name that rhymes with fart I would definitely have it legally changed.  Next let's look at the character.  A middle aged no account that lives with his mother(Shirley Knight, Little Boy Blue, Grown Ups, Stuart Saves Family etc.), has a half Mexican daughter that he had with his deceased highly obese wife.  She also lives with him and his mother.  Paul is obnoxious, annoying, and just plain self-absorbed.  He only seems to care about his mother and daughter out of necessity, but not any other reason.  As for the rest of the world, he couldn't care less.  Not a very likable character in my book.  He meets some nothing special looking young woman that works in the same mall as Paul does and Paul is interested in  her as a possible love interest.  The character is played by some really dull and completely obscure actress.  His daughter is some bad newcomer actress.

There's really not much to say about the plot to this turdfest.  All that happens is one day he goes to work and meets his new partner Veck.  What kind of a stupid name is Veck btw.  It sounds like a noise one makes while wretching.  Anyway, Veck is hatching a plan to rob the mall with help from his partners who(becuse it's Christmas time) he with no creative thought codenames them after  Santa's reindeer.  As this is setting up Paul's dating the young woman and has outbursts with customers and destroys things and even assaults a local musician while drunk.  Earlier in the movie Paul callously runs over the neighbors dog with the Segway Human Transporter that he uses for work.  Why the audience should care if a total jerk like him ever finds love I don't know.

Anyway back to the paper thin main plot.  All that happens is, when the cops arrive to handle the situation, Paul stupidly decides to remain in the shopping mall to both save his love interest and stop Veck and his gang.  What a moron!

To make a long and not especially interesting story short; Paul has an absurdly easy time putting a stop to the bad guys's robbery.  How that's even remotely possible being that they're in way better shape than this obese idiot and of all laughable things, they all have James Bond-like espionage gear.  Yet still they proved no match for an obese wimp of a mall cop.  Absolutely ridiculous!

The only interesting thing about this movie is the very mall that this took place is the same mall that I visited several Christmas's ago when visiting family in Boston.  I don't remember its name off hand unfortunately.  So much of what you see in the movie, like the ball pit for example was only used for the movie and isn't there in real life.

In closing, this movie is slow moving, duller than dishwater, not funny once, not even clever, badly written, unfocused in general, it has no charm at all, it's very crude, boasts an unlikable jerk of a main character that's impossible to root for, a dull filler love interest, no cool, quotable lines or catchphrases, it's entirely forgettable a few days after viewing it, the villains are lame and uncharismatic, also Paul has way too easy a time beating the villains, the plot is way too simple-minded, and worst of all every time Paul does something wrong, there's never any consequence for his anti-social behavior.  In reality the stupid and anti-social things he does could get a person fired, locked up, fined,  or written up at his job.  The punk gets any with everything!  To be fair, Kevin James has proven himself to be one hilarious comedian on TV's The King of Queens and TV's Everybody Loves Raymond(playing the same character on both shows) also, his stand up was also hilarious.  His foray into film however, has proven a huge train wreck.  Some comics just aren't made for anything but the stage and tv. The only reason to watch this complete travesty of a movie is if you have an hour and a half to kill and nothing better to watch.  Otherwise it's better to avoid this painfully bad movie like the plague that it is.  As for its sequel, I'm pretty sure that unless I'm bored that I would never watch it.",1438905600,,4329,4.597911227154047

Unfortunately my guesses were right almost every time, but that is not to say there are no fun moments. It isn't the worst film, and it is nowhere near the greaytest. It's a good time, but the values it presents are not universal and are in fact absurd as well as deliberately foolish.",1435881600,,405,4.486486486486487

3722149,5,B001NPD9RM,"Paul Blart: Mall Cop helped me get a PhD.
I sat down to write my final exam. It just had one question: I had to write an essay applying Derrida's ideas of deconstruction to Saussure's linguistic theories. I looked at the paper and realized: I have no idea what any of this means.
I'd spent the whole semester just watching Paul Blart: Mall Cop, day after day, instead of studying. It was, I thought, a mistake.
It turns out it was the best decision I'd ever made.
Taking a bold stand, I just wrote one sentence as my answer: ""The mind is the only weapon that doesn't need a holster. - Paul Blart (Mall Cop)."" Then I handed it in.
The class gasped. We had three hours to write it, and I was done in five minutes. How does he know the material so well? they were all wondering.
I gave it to the professor. He looked at it. Then he looked at me. Then he said, ""Are you telling me that all you wrote on this paper was a single quote from Paul Blart: Mall Cop?""
I stared him in the eye without even flinching and dropped another classic Blartism on him: ""I know a lot about sharks.""
He looked back at the paper, back at me one more, and then nodded. He pulled out his red pen, wrote ""A+"" on the page, and then just said, ""Sick reference, man. Sick reference.""
Thanks to his recommendation, I was first choice for the direct-entry PhD program.",1430092800,6,1337,4.2265625

3722284,4,B001NPD9RM,"The first  words that I could think of to describe it are: 'The American Jacques Clouseau.'

This is an interesting film in that it is neatly divided into 2 halves. The first half is funny in a slapstick way. The 2nd half is quite the opposite. It suddenly becomes quite serious as well as poignant.

Paul Blart at first appears to be this hopeless loser. He wants to be a State Trooper, but we can see that this is clearly impossible for him. Besides being too out of shape, he is prone to fainting due to his hypoglycemia. In his home life, we see that he is pretty hopeless in the dating department. His mother and daughter remain supportive of him though. Having been forced to abandon his hopes of becoming a State Trooper, he continues his work as a security guard in the mall. At times he is over zealous about his job. This not only annoys his superiors, but it usually gets him into trouble. Many people in the mall don't respect him. On more than 1 occasion, he suffers a job related injury from people who seem to be aware that security guards really don't have the authority to arrest or ticket someone. Regrettably, a scene that underlines this was deleted where he's referred to as a 'fake cop.'

To be sure, despite his inability to speak well to a woman he wants to go out with, he's not a complete outcast. There are some people at the mall who seem to like him.  But when he tries to assert himself, he usually ends up looking all the more hopeless. A seemingly not too bright guard that Paul has been training doesn't take him seriously. But at one point, he at least seemingly tries to come to his aid. And following the Jacques Clouseau formula, after having laughed at him for some time, we may begin to start finding his pathetic state less funny, and feeling more sorry for him.

This is when the 2nd half of the film kicks in. On the busiest shopping day of the year, the mall is taken over by an armed gang. And in a convincingly unfolding moment, someone who seemed not so bright and at least a little friendly, turns out to be the mastermind behind the takeover. With hostages having been taken, it's not long before the local authorities arrive. But since hostages have been taken, it's not like they can just raid the mall. At first, it looks like the unarmed Paul is crazy or suicidal when he refuses to leave the mall. But after a couple of accidental victories over the gang members, he starts to become more intelligent and resourceful.  The local authorities try to tell him to leave, but when he refuses, they accept him as their 'inside man,' and ask him to gather what information he can as to where the hostages are.

In yet another twist, the local authorities seem pretty helpless. (Though through no real fault of their own.) They don't want to just raid the mall and risk the hostages getting hurt. And while we may have not known what to think of them, we suddenly find ourselves siding with them when a RAID team shows up, and their leader is so nasty and obnoxious that we can conclude that the local authorities have to be the good guys in this scenario.  It is interesting that even  in this stressful situation that the outside forces are NOT united. The RAID forces just seem full of themselves and don't care about the hostages. The local authorities haven't been able to do much, but at least they are concerned about the hostages coming out alive. And they offer Paul what help they can.

Despite his pathetic early appearance, Paul becomes notably more heroic as he single handedly fights the gang members using what resources he had. So first, we laughed at him. Then we felt sorry for him. And now we find ourselves cheering for the man we one laughed at. GREAT FORMULA!

I don't want to risk ruining the final surprise for those of you who haven't seen it. But just when it seems that Paul has finished the game, we find that there was an outside party who was working with the armed gang.  It's not the biggest surprise though.

What's really poignant here is that this job was not Paul's first choice at all. But eventually when he's given a touching and tempting offer by the local authorities, Paul realizes what he does best. And he knows that while this job isn't what he really wanted, he should continue to do the job that he does best.

A strong point about this film is that it starts really funny, but then gradually becomes more touching and serious. And perhaps even better is that Paul starts out as an exaggerated bumbling failure.  But he gradually becomes more human as the film goes on.",1426982400,,4561,4.4639423076923075

They will get one more chance.  I use Netflix all the time in HD without a single issue-ever!!  As for the Prime subscription:  I was not happy with the selection.

My 11 year old also found it to be slow in the beginning and we almost threw in the towel but we hung in there and we enjoyed it as it had some nice slap-stick comedy via awkward moments which turned out to be enjoyable. Probably better enjoyed by a younger audience say 6 to 15 years old. Overall it was just okay, with the slow start really hurting it.",1420329600,2,435,4.190476190476191

3722344,4,B001NPD9RM,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, despite a few issues.  These things might not seem like flaws to another person, though, so you will have to be the judge.  There are laughs galore and many that are designed to make us feel a bit uncomfortable about finding them funny.  The main characters are all very likeable by anyone who has a heart.  If you don't find the main characters sweet and charming, it might be a time for a glance in the mental mirror (sorry to be so blunt, but if you're offended by this statement, it's definitely time for a bit of self reflection!).

This movie can be really uncomfortable to watch for those who are struggling with weight issues because it hits quite close to home in a lot of places - minus the ability to become the hero and save the day.  I would be careful about watching this seemingly harmless movie with children without having a conversation about it afterwards.  It's important that we all really get the point or this movie is just another series of fat jokes.  Eh, a good fat joke can get my round belly jiggling with laughter, too, but the world needs a few fat heroes, too.

Although it's good fun for anyone, I most highly recommend this movie to those with children of any age because, with a bit of talking afterwards, you can really see where your child's head is at in regards to compassion and seeing the value in others.  It might bring out some scary things that you don't want to address but are necessary for the child to become a caring person later in life.  This can be a great parenting tool or it can just be a lot of laughs for an adult who loves to see the underdog come out on top.",1419897600,2,1655,4.340909090909091

3722406,3,B001NPD9RM,"Kevin James is wonderful as a single father Paul Blart, a Segway-riding security guard at a shopping mall, who really wants to be a member of the New Jersey State Police. He is attracted to a kiosk vendor Amy Anderson (Jayma Mays), but finds it hard to muster courage to talk to her.

In the meanwhile, because of a group of criminals Paul gets trapped in a Die Hard- like situation, where he has to confront these baddies and save the day. But can he really do that?

Some may find the jokes (mainly slapstick) a little too tame. Maybe that is exactly the point of Paul Blart: Mall Cop in which you will find no nudities or so-called gross-out gags (and this is a Happy Madison Productions). Directed by Steve Carr (Daddy Day Care), the films jokes are aimed at younger audiences.

In short, Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a pretty pleasant but completely forgettable comedy starring likable Kevin James, who, it is obvious, could have added something more to the paper-thin story and one-dimensional character. I hope that the (now) planned sequel will allow him to show what he can do.",1401321600,,1081,4.590673575129534

3722427,5,B001NPD9RM,"If this movie came with a moral, it'd be that anyone can find love and happiness and that it might be right under your nose along.  Me, I came for the comedy and I wound up enjoying myself.  Unlike Adam Sandler, Kevin James can be a bit more diverse in his acting abilities and so his mall cop character doesn't come off as being cut from the same cloth as his roles in films such as ""Hitch"" and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"".  There are certainly similarities, but the man's only human.  Anyway, our mall cop hero wants to join the New Jersey State Police and suddenly finds himself in the middle of a robbery/hostage situation inside his beloved mall.  I do wonder how many actual mall cops would go back in there instead of leaving it to, say, an armed SWAT team, but it just speaks to the character's dedication and loyalty in this film (listen to the diologe about the ""oath"" and you'll be laughing as you see exactly how far all this goes.)  I'm not sure, but there was a line in the trailer where Mr. James says ""Our security's fine but ultimately we count on the hope that nothing ever goes down.""  I don't recall if this line made it into the final product, but I think it ought to have (kind like the chat about blackjack tables in ""Con Air"".)  Yes, this film's ending is predictible about five minutes in and some plot points are convaluted at best, but I came for the comedy and I'm happy.  So do as I did.  Enjoy.",1387324800,,1434,4.277777777777778
3722428,5,B001NPD9RM,"Because of negative reviews of this film, I thought it would be bad, but I bought anyway to watch for myself.  After watching it, and liking it a lot, my only negative review is of the negative reviewers.  Kevin James does great physical comedy in the movie, and it was entertaining to see some real-life reflections of things like some security/law enforcement thinking everyone is a civilian except for themselves.  The story line is a sappy nonsense cliche of boy meets girl and encounters an unreal challenge scenario where he proves to be a hero.  Even so, I enjoyed watching it and think it is a great movie for kids.  It's rare to find a well done, clean movie, that's not all computer animation.

As a guy, it was very hard not to feel for James' character, who was lonely and lovelorn and wanted to feel a sense of significance about his life, and to feel attractive to an attractive member of the opposite sex.

3722466,3,B001NPD9RM,"There are moments in this comedy where you chuckle but no outright laughs-a-go-go. The title character's name is hilarious and the fact he patrols a mall on a Segway gets a few laughs. The reliance on many American comedies to add some sort of violent criminal act as the basis of comedy high jinx I still find bizarre.

Given that throughout the movie I could not figure out why the criminals were jumping around like circus acrobats, riding skateboards and BMX bikes in the mall. It just seemed nonsensical. That is until you get the extras. There are 49 minutes of extras on the DVD and at first, you scratch your head as to why a B movie comedy would have that length of extras. Then you watch and see that the criminals are all basically ""pro"" skateboarders/BMX riders hence all the fancy moves. Plus you'll be totally enthralled by parkour and free running (for the uninformed, Wiki both). Honestly, a documentary on that would be worth five stars.

That's what is so bizarre about this movie. They obviously hired topnotch ""stunt"" people and a name actor. Sadly, the script is lacking in any consistent comedic touches. I'll add it's an Adam Sandler project who has not done a decent movie in about eight years.",1325980800,,1218,4.660465116279069

As a simple guy dedicated to his job of protecting the shopping mall at Christmas when a gang of thieves attempts to divert income from the credit cards, comedian Kevin James has ample material for hilarity. This he fully exploits without stooping to off-color humor or cheap sex. The movie is mindless, relaxing, clean and very entertaining.

3722476,1,B001NPD9RM,"I live a pretty stressful life and when I saw the preview for this film I wanted to see it to escape some of that stress but for some reason never got around to going to the theater.  Fortunately, I live right across the public library and just grab my movies from there because if I had paid one cent for either renting or owning this film I would have been very upset with myself.  Along with other terrible films like Scenes from a Mall and Little Black Book, Paul Blart: Mall Cop has to be up there.  How this film managed to be the #1 film in America and how it has managed to receive so many favorable reviews speaks more to the power of advertising and the dwindling intellect of the American public.  By any objective measure, this film is terrible. The acting is terrible, the character development is terrible, the plot is terrible, the believability level of the film is terrible, and on and on and on.  I suppose the one good thing of the film was the musical choices which are mainly classic rock.  That part I felt was good.  Otherwise, I don't recommend this film.

The idea of a building a storyline around a mall cop is a pretty good idea and could be pretty funny if done right, but this film is anything but funny.  It's down right embarrassing.  These days, film studios are under immense pressure to produce profitable films and often times trade plot quality for star power.  Believe it or not, there was a time when comedies were actually funny and there were several great comedic actors: Charlie Chaplin, The Marx Brothers, Steve Martin, Leslie Nielsen, Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Cosby, etc...",1296864000,,1617,4.541379310344827
3722477,4,B001NPD9RM,"Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a really... odd type of comedy.  It definitely relies on cheap gags to pull the story through, and many of the jokes honestly don't work at all, but you know, who cares?  Because many of the jokes *do* make me react positively to them by making me smile, at least.

One thing's for sure- do NOT expect a particularly interesting storyline.  It's pretty lackluster in that respect but you know, I have a feeling it's supposed to be that way.  It's supposed to be a really cheesy comedy style.  That's even how it was advertised, if you remember.

It's about an overweight man who rides around all day on a motorized scooter through the crowded hallways of a shopping mall searching for crime.

Along the way he meets a very attractive young woman working one of the stores, and he instantly falls in love with her but of course -like always- she doesn't feel the same way about him.  Oh darn!  Didn't see THAT coming!  Talk about a total mismatch, haha.

The storyline is actually significantly different (and better) during the second half when the overweight man finds himself caught up in a crime/robbery taking place inside the mall.  There was a small twist here concerning one of the characters and it definitely surprised me, so good job to the movie writers there.  You'll know what it is when you see it happen.

The man finds himself involved in some of the whackiest and craziest ways *imaginable* concerning himself (and his scooter) by taking  out the bad guys one by one and, as a result, this definitely saved the movie from what surely would have been an instant ratings bomb.

I mean, think about it- had the storyline stuck solely to the man trying to win over the attractive woman it simply wouldn't have worked, and I imagine the writers realized this which prompted them to give us a lengthy, dramatic storyline change of events for the second half.

It's not like the first half of the movie is really BAD or anything- it just needed to actually go somewhere and thank God it did.  Seeing the overweight man get drunk and humiliate himself time and time again wouldn't have been strong enough to keep my interest.

Overall, yes, do NOT expect an intelligent type of comedy.  Actually the second half of the film totally reminds me of the bad guys invading the home in the classic comedy Home Alone, and it's not really a whole lot different here.  Same offbeat whacky style, at least.

Quality jokes -some of them definitely hit or miss- and a cheap storyline, but overall it's worth watching.",1296604800,,2538,4.616071428571429
3722478,4,B001NPD9RM,"Paul Blart Mall Cop (2009) provides some mild laughs mostly based on the personality and physique of Kevin James.  James (The King Of Queens) who co-wrote the film and stars as Blart, doesn't seem to be interested in showcasing himself to excess, as some in comedy are prone to.  And James is not afraid to poke a little fun at himself, and his slightly pudgy build.  Directed by Steve Carr, the film incorporates some action sequences that perks things up, and a goofy but entirely expected romantic element, that isn't too intrusive or syrupy sweet.

A security guard for ten years, Paul Bart has dreams of joining the New Jersey State Police, but has been unable to pass the tests, mainly due to his less than ideal physical condition.  A single father of one, Blart is also looking for love, and sets his sights on Amy Anderson the owner of a hair accessory kiosk in the mall.  After giving Amy a cozy ride to her car on his Segway, it appears that the big guy might actually have a chance, but after getting drunk and making a fool of himself, the opportunity may have been lost.  The drunk scene seems out of place, as Blart comes off as an unsympathetic jerk.

Things between Paul and Amy are up in the air, when a criminal gang led by Blart's new partner Veck Simms (Keir O'Donnell), takes over the mall, chases everyone out, and locks it down.  The plan is to obtain as many security codes as possible, and then electronically steal funds.  After the takeover, just the gang, a few hostages in the bank including Amy, and Blart, remain in the mall.

Blart establishes radio contact with his boss, and the police who have surrounded the mall.  What follows is kind of fun, as the mall cop singlehandedly battles Veck's crew of extreme sport enthusiasts.  The stunts are cool, but not spectacular, with the incident where Blart is trapped in a ventilation duct, probably the funniest.  Each gang member that Blart puts out of commission, gets Veck more annoyed, but he can't get too nasty in a PG-13er.  Stuart (Stephen Rannazzisi) another of the hostages, predictably turns out to be a weasel, and the addition of Blart's daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) to the hostages, raises the stakes in the game.

To its credit, the film doesn't push things to extremes trying to be funny, and there are a few unexpected twists that make things a little more interesting.  The final twist may be one too many but the crisis is resolved so quickly that it hardly matters, as Paul Blart rises to the occasion and emerges as a hero.  Goofy, clean, fun for the entire family, the chances are we haven't seen the last of Mr. Blart.",1296345600,,2623,4.592274678111588

Rogen takes a crazy, trailer-trash approach and once you get used to the shock of a mall streaker and Rogen's insane response there is some funny stuff. Kevin James went for a PG comedy that winds up being the more believable and less crazy of the two films. True, some would say that Rogen's F-bomb spouting mall cop is more ""real.""

3722481,4,B001NPD9RM,"This movie is multi-dimensional in its nature. These are like layers, and they are well integrated. The net result is a complete cinematic experience.

First Dimension:

This movie starts off as a Romantic/Comedy of sorts. Where Paul Blart (Kevin James) is an overly strict mall cop (mind you, not a mere security guard). He gets caught up in some very awkward and comical situations. Amy (Jayma Mays) catches his eye he then starts to woo her. Everything falls through when he gets drunk and makes a complete fool of himself.

Second Dimension:

While the situation with Amy seems to have fizzled out, the movie shifts gears into its 'Die Hard' mode, where the mall cop is the last man standing inside the mall that is now in the hands of bandits, and there is a hostage situation. Of course Amy, as well as Paul's daughter are amongst the hostages.

The action here is pretty intense as the bad guys are some serious X-games types of individuals and very acrobatic. The mall cop is without a gun, so he has to depend on resourcefulness and the element of surprise.

Musical Dimension:

Throughout this show, a lot of 80s Pop/Rock hits are played. This music serves to provide a bit of nostalgia for the more grown up segment of the audience. The slower songs set a very romantic mood, while the faster songs keep the tempo of the action.

Conclusion:

Overall this movie is an enjoyable watch. Some may find the romance/comedy section a bit of a drag, but I think that they did a good job. I like how this movie cannot be molded into one genre. It's great with some pop corn.",1294099200,,1577,4.5638297872340425

Blart is serious about his job, maybe too serious.  In any case, he is unaware that a gang of criminals dressed as santa's helpers are out to steal the entire mall's take on the evening of Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year.

The entire mall is cleared of customers, except for a few hostages the crooks have kept as insurance.  Blart is NOT going to let this go down on HIS watch in HIS mall.  So the lovable, overweight Blart is faced with the challenge of his lifetime.  Will he fold like a cream puff under the pressure or will he find that he is made of sterner stuff?

You can probably fill in all the blanks, but I found that there are some laugh-out-loud funny parts, and while the show is far-fetched and quite silly, it is also endearing.

He got a hold of hard lemmonade, probable beknownst to him, and he was doing a little of breakdancing, and he was quite a character.
I was touched by the fact his daughter did not want to see her father alone without a relationship. I also loved that he showed people he was not a loser after all!

If you like silly --walkin' that fine line betwixt silly and stupid-- humor, that's clean with a light romantic element, and like spoofs (think ""Die Hard"" with a few twists...well, more than a few) then you'll probably like this.  Also if you like Kevin James in general, either from his stand-up comedian shows (""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" is great), or his TV show (which I've never seen), you'll probably enjoy this.  I really enjoyed all the Special Features on this DVD, too, and watched all of them -- and there was a lot to see.  The behind the scenes footage was very interesting, and I had no idea when I first saw it that these guys were professional ""X-Gamers,"" and everyone did all their own stunts, and even did some things just for the Special Features.

It has some decent moments in it, but it's more about a very pathetic man who is a loser due to poor decisions in life than about someone who ""gets the girl"" due to his untapped potential.  Where there is an attempt at humor, it comes off as pitiful and pathetic - not funny.

3722513,2,B001NPD9RM,"I'm a Kevin James fan. I own four of the nine seasons of King of Queens, I thought he was the best part of Hitch, and I catch his Comedy Central special every time it's on TV. He's always excellent at playing a schlub that you root for, and characters that you generally care about. Add the charm of Kevin James with the Happy Madison production company and the producing power of Adam Sandler and I knew I had to check this out.

Paul Blart (Kevin James) is a single father living in New Jersey whose lifelong dream of being a state trooper keeps getting sidelined by his hypoglycemia so he works as a mall security officer. Paul's daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez), keeps begging her father to get back on the dating scene, even going so far as to make him an online dating profile, and he keeps refusing until he meets Amy (Jayma Mays), a mall wig merchant. Paul never sticks up for himself, and never quite takes the plunges or makes the moves that he needs to until he finds his daughter and the woman he cares about taken hostage and his mall in danger.

 As a fan of Kevin James, and recently Jayma Mays (Heroes, Glee), and I have to admit that this movie was quite a let down, especially considering that Kevin James co-wrote the screenplay. You'd think that the idea of a failed trooper trainee come mall cop who spends most of his day driving around a segway would lead to some great jokes and hilarious turns, but what we get is a cliche driven film that tries to find more fun in Paul Blart's hypoglycemia and weight than anything else. In truth we've seen this all before: down on his luck underdog fails, gets lesser job, meets girl, never really hooks up with girl, girl's in trouble, underdog takes out many people stronger and more skilled than he is, wins girl, gets opportunity to have job he wanted but turns it down for lesser job. In other words there's nothing new here.

To add to the problems, the director and the editor doesn't seem to know how to let a scene breath and doesn't appear to know much about comedic timing. On several occasions throughout the movie it seemed like there was a good set up that could have led to great laughs, but the director chose to cut on that scene to move to another scene ruining the atmosphere. They also don't seem to know how to edit to get the best take, many lines in the movie could have possibly been funny if delivered differently, but the joke was lost in the chosen take.

That's not to say that the entire movie is a lost cause. There's one scene that features Paul Blart getting absolutely wasted at a work get together that had me nearly reduced to tears from laughing so hard. Some of the action is fairly well shot as well, with some of the ""bad guys"" obviously played by extreme sports athletes.

But for the few good parts there is too much dead space where there's not a laugh to be found or a snort of, ""That was kind of clever."" The characters are thinly written, and there is too much relying on everything that's come before. I would probably say give it a rental, but luckily it's no longer in the theater. Hopefully, next time Kevin James will pick a better project to devote his time to.

Nary a gunshot is fired yet there's a high thrill quotient on display.  Kevin James makes for an affable screen presence but he won't make you forget corpulent legends like Jackie Gleason or John Candy.

Blart is shown to be training a new hire who later is part of a group who invade the Mall taking hostages and robbing the bank.

What separates Step Brothers, which I hated, from Mall Cop, which I enjoyed? Why did this movie work whereas Funny People, another more critically received Sandler project, disappointed me?
There is little original in the story, there are the predictable credibility issues (young attractive girl falls for shleppy overweight loser - oh, what hath Seth Rogen wrought?), and there's Sandler's penchant for schlocky 80s pop music touchstones that buddy Kevin James is borrowing, but still I found myself laughing out loud during much of this movie even when I saw the gag coming from a mile away. Either my opinion isn't worth squat or the reviewers who tore this movie to shreds need to lighten up. Or maybe neither. Maybe individual taste is just too complex to figure out and the reasons we react the way we do to entertainments aren't so important after all. All I know is that I liked Mall Cop.

3722526,3,B001NPD9RM,"I really wanted to love this movie so much but I came away only liking it a lot. Kevin James is a very likeable actor, following on from his portrayal of Doug on t.v.'s The King of Queens. But maybe either he is simply not a strong enough actor to carry an entire film on his own (which he does here) or maybe he needed a ""straight"" man in this film. As much beloved as the character of Barney Fife was, it is entirely possible that had he been given a series of his own, without Andy Taylor as his straight man, it would very likely have worn thin pretty quickly. Just look at most of the films Don Knotts made on his own to see this. I recall just how well the teaming of John Candy and Steve Martin worked in Planes, Trains and Automobiles and think this type of formula would maybe have made Paul Blart: Mall Cop a better film. Paul Blart: Mall Cop doesn't really have a whole lot of story to build on and it is too much like a t.v. show to be expanded to a feature-length film. There are those who praise the film for being more suitable for general audiences than many of the comedy films being made these days. There are also those who may well have preferred it to have more ""adult"" content. I enjoyed the film anyway, but I came away feeling just a bit letdown. To me, instead of finding Paul Blart to be a hilarious buffoon, I found him to be a very lonely and sad overweight man raising his daughter alone. He just wanted someone in his life to love and be loved by. This made the film more realistic for me than I expected and as a result, not as much fun as it could have been. I really liked lovely Jayma Mays. I only wish she had had a larger part in the film. It would have worked better to have given the relationship more time to grow. It seemed a bit unlikely and rushed and unrealistic. I know the film was a huge success at the box-office. Maybe it will help to make Kevin James's next films even better.",1249862400,,1925,4.122340425531915

3722528,2,B001NPD9RM,"When I first saw he previews for ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop""I didn't think that it looked funny. However, I was told by a couple of people that is was a lot better than the previews, and since my wife and I are big Kevin James fans we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the theatrical previews were much funnier than the actual movie which was neither funny or entertaining.

One reviewer made the comparison between Kevin James and John Candy - which I think is appropriate. John Candy may have been able to pull-off ""Paul Blart"" since he was able to play a sympathetic down-on-his-luck character (Think ""Uncle Buck"" and ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles""), but Kevin James just couldn't do it.  Without the character connection it meant the movie had to rely on its plot.... not good ....or its humor ...also not good. While some kids may find the movie funny (the movie is appropriate for all ages - there is very little that would make a parent uncomfortable) most adults would find the jokes and physical humor to be a bit cartoonish. At the end I was disappointed in Kevin James since he really is a funny guy. There were moments when he pulled out his ""King of Queens"" character but they were mostly ill-timed and not funny.

  Why two stars instead of one? It is a bit of a surprise but the stunts (While wildly unrealistic) are fun to watch, also Kevin James became quite the accomplished Segway operator - while it is not enough to make you watch the movie it is kinda cool how he was able to weave his Segway in-and-out of traffic!

James stars as Paul Blart, a 10-year security cop veteran at the West Orange, New Jersey shopping mall.  Blart is a rather simple person who lives with his mother and young daughter.  On the job, Blart must deal with wise-cracking kids who throw ball pit balls at him and senior citizens in wheelchairs who drive their scooters too fast for his liking.  With the holidays approaching, Paul must train a new guard; Veck Simms (Keir O'Donnell).  Simms, a self-described high school dropout who couldn't find any other line of work, is soon on the job with Blart.

There's another person who works at the mall as well.  Her name is Amy (Jayma Mays).  Paul has fallen hard for her, but can he overcome his simpleton ways in order for her to notice him?

Soon, the day after Thanksgiving arrives (known to shoppers as ""Black Friday""), and the West Orange mall is overrun with bargain-hunting holiday shoppers.  But shoppers aren't the only ones in the mall this day, for soon, a group of vigilantes, led by none other than security guard trainee Simms, proceed to take over the mall with the hopes of obtaining credit card transaction numbers.  All other employees have left except Blart, who was playing ""Guitar Hero"" in the video arcade when the bad guys struck.  Now, its up to Blart to foil the plan of the bad guys and free the hostages, which includes Paul's beloved Amy.  Will he succeed before its too late?

This is a very funny movie.  Kevin James does a great job as Blart, while Jayma Mays and Keir O'Donnell give good supporting performances.  The content is such that this movie can be watched by both adults and children.  The comedy is first-rate and will keep you laughing throughout.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  For a really good laugh, don't miss ""Mall Cop"".",1246924800,,1896,4.708206686930091

3722538,1,B001NPD9RM,"Synopsis: Paul Blart (Kevin James) has aspirations to be a police officer, but has to settle into being a mall security guard to support his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) due to his physical limitations. In spite of this, he takes his job very, very seriously even when his cohorts don't. When not trying to protect the mall or trying to train the new guard Veck Simms (Keir O'Donnell), he's trying to find his way into the heart of Amy (Jayma Mays) but lacks the self-esteem to do so properly. Well on the night of Black Friday (the first day of the shopping season), an organized group of criminals manages to take the mall hostage in an attempt to get all the money in the vault. Veck is shown to be the leader of the group and with both Amy and Maya held hostage, it's up to Paul Blart to save the day...

I got one word to sum up this movie: Yawn! I heard a few positive things about the film and decided to check it out, but I was ultimately disappointed with the film. The acting's not bad, but the premise is kinda weak and follows the typical level of humor the Happy Madison camp loves to go for: A loveable schmuck must overcome himself and his naysayers to get the love interest and family member saved at the end. This one just does it with a whole lot less profanity than most of the other films the camp puts out.

All and all, this might be decent for a family night rental from one of those $1 DVD kiosks but anyone outside of the ""family"" video genre will likely be bored by the humor of the film.",1246752000,5,1517,4.2456747404844295
3722539,2,B001NPD9RM,"Why is it that moviemakers just never seem to be able to leave well enough alone?  In the case of ""Paul Blart - Mall Cop,"" what starts off as a sweet and goofy little farce about a lovable loser with an outsized body and an outsized heart, in no time flat, devolves into just another boring, over-the-top action comedy.  The movie features ""King of Queens""'s Kevin James as an overzealous, scooter-riding security guard in a New Jersey shopping center who ""don't get no respect"" from either his fellow officers on the beat or the regular citizens whose safety he's sworn himself to protect.

James has enough charm and likeability to make even the slapstick parts look easy, and the script (which James co-wrote), in the initial stages at least, has a playfulness that keeps the humor from becoming overly broad or juvenile.  But then disaster strikes when some armed criminals take over the mall, holding a half dozen or so of the employees and customers hostage.  Soon, the bumbling Blart is springing into action, single-handedly taking on the bad guys and simultaneously running the movie into the ground in the process.  The story's premise really only works if the windmills this wannabe state trooper is tilting at remain illusory and harmless.  But once the menace becomes real, much of what makes the concept funny in the first place disappears, and we're left with just another over-produced, stunt-driven fairy tale in which an unlikely action hero saves the day and gets to take home the girl (the lovely Jayma Mays, who`s indeed quite a girl to get to take home).

3722542,1,B001NPD9RM,"I do not often review comedy films, but I did watch this film, I felt it was pretty poor. Now, I know many comedies do not make common sense, but this film REALLY makes no sense.

Firstly, I did not think the jokes presented were humorous. Most of the film was pretty much criminals acting like four year olds. Now, I understand many comedies present stupid villains, but the villains in this film were absolutely pathetic.

Secondly, the whole plot was absurd. Basically, none of what occurred in the film is even possible. For example, what is the purpose of having criminals who perform aerobics like clowns in a circus yet cannot eliminate a security guard?  Secondly, why not just shoot the security guard through the head the first time you saw him? Thirdly, I do not understand the whole idea of the codes? Once the police outside knew the codes were what the criminals inside wanted, how long could it take to deactivate the codes? Fourthly, the criminals, having the security guard's daughter, could have easily hold him to surrender or else they were going to immediately shoot her. Fifthly, I have difficult time believing in having a SWAT leader as the major criminal mastermind. It is completely unnecessary.

I understand that this film is supposed to make the mall cop an unlikely hero. However, I just cannot buy any of the arguments in this film. As far as I saw and listened, the film was a complete and predictable bore. Certainly, young children may like some of the elementary humor (which is young children appropriate), yet I cannot believe many teenagers or adults will find this film humorous.

He's a doting mall cop always reciting the rules to other mall cops. He has a crush on some woman in the mall who in real life would never go near him but of course in the movie she ends up with him. Typical boy meets girl crap. The movie drags like crazy for the first 45 minutes and then out of nowhere it becomes a blatant Die Hard rip off. People take over the mall to try to get codes to the credit card machines and he's the only one who can save the hostages in the mall while communicating with cops that are outside the building (sound familiar??). Then the enemies are zippin' around the mall like extreme sport ppl with skateboards and bikes. So naturally mall cop saves all and that's it. WHO CARES?!!

Kevin James is a highly underrated actor in the mold of William Shatner as well as being an hilarious comedian. His role in ""Mall Cop"" is similar to Jackie Gleason's in ""Smokey and the Bandit"".

3722552,4,B001NPD9RM,"Kevin James trades in his delivery uniform for a mall cop's garb in the family-friendly ""Paul Blart:  Mall Cop.""

It's been years since Blart's wife left him and his daughter alone.  The pair are living with his mother.  While repeatedly attempting and failing to pass training at the New Jersey State Police Academy (due to his hypoglycemia), Blart holds down a job as a security guard at the local mall.  With Christmas in the near future, the mall's business has picked up.

Blart finds himself attracted to a new seller, Amy (Jayma Mays), at one of the kiosks in the mall.  Self-conscious and socially awkward, Blart struggles to start a conversation with her.  As the story rolls along, Blart does build a weak friendship with Amy and is also put in charge of training a new hire.

When Black Friday comes around, all chaos breaks loose.  A group of skateboarding, BMX-riding thugs take over the mall and collect a small group of hostages (including many of Blart's friends and Amy) to hold off the police.  They plan to steal credit card codes from the higher end stores in the mall and make a quick escape.

The only thing standing in their way is Paul Blart.  He stumbles, bumbles and rumbles his way through the scenery, chewing up the mall like a pretzel.  At first he is scared of the idea of taking on professional criminals, but when another person is added to the group of hostages, Blart goes into ""Die Hard"" mode and begins taking out the criminals one by one.

The result is a very funny slapstick comedy for the whole family.  There's very little strong language, limited humorous sexuality, and the cast is, for the most part, very likeable.

The DVD comes with many obligatory extras including previews and deleted scenes.  Also included are featurettes on the making of the film.  My personal favorite was the featurette on the many stunts featured in the film.

""Paul Blart:  Mall Cop"" deserves a solid three-and-one-half stars.  It's silly and clean enough for youngsters to enjoy, and the actions of James and company are smart enough to make even the most intelligent adult chuckle.

Anyway, Paul Blart, Mall Cop seemed to me to be half comedy that was too broad for King of Queens and half satire of many action films. Kevin James is always funny to me, no matter what he does or says, but I truly think this movie was well done. Especially because I hardly ever watch movies anymore because many are too predictable or too over-the-top.

What really bothered me was the fact that he never picked up a gun when he had the chance.  There was a sporting goods store, for chrissake.  He would probably have had an arsenal at his disposal.  Failing that (say, the bad guys had secured that store) there would surely have been any number of scissors and box cutters in offices and store rooms, not to mention the vast array of cutlery available in any food establishment.

Still, I laughed hard quite a number of times throughout this movie.  Someone behind this movie had clearly been watching a lot of Rambo movies, too.

Basically it's good and funny provided you can overlook the ""Home Alone"" aspect.  But, you know, it's rated PG, and appropriately so.

3722562,5,B001NPD9RM,"I love me some Kevin James and so I was actually really excited about this movie, despite the fact that it did look rather lame.  I loved what he did in `Hitch' and even though I feel that `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry' was a ridiculous mess of a film, I found James to be the best part of it and actually funny in almost all of his scenes.  Couple that with the fact that I watch `King of Queen's every day and the fact that recently an Ammy buddy of mine (here's your shout out MKIA) gave this five stars (hehe, we really are twins) and you have a few good reasons why I made this a must see film for my weekend.

I was far from let down.

Yes, this is not a brilliant comedy.  It is a family gag film.  In line with my grading scale though, when taken in context, this is a brilliant comedy.  I mean, it does not set out there to be a smart and intelligent satire or anything like that.  It attempts to get a rise out of the entire family (from the wee-little ones to the scrupulous adults) with countless pratfalls and childish humor and it actually succeeds just about everywhere.  I can't think of a segment that didn't work.

I was laughing consistently.

The film centers around Paul Blart, a security guard who is very unlucky in just about everything.  His wife left him and their daughter after she became a US citizen; he's been stuck doing the same thing for ten years despite repeatedly trying to advance to something better; he's consistently poked fun at while at work by everyone from co-workers to mall shoppers.

Paul Blart is, for lack of a better word, a loser.

After setting up the film by giving us the lowdown on Paul, his home life, his work relationships and his newfound crush on fellow mall worker Amy (that segue scene is hilarious) we are thrown into a `Die Hard' spoof when the mall is overtaken by superhuman thieves on Black Friday.  With certain mall employees taken hostage and the rest of the mall evacuated, Paul finds himself the only hope of saving his mall.

What is so great about `Paul Blart: Mall Cop' is the casting of Kevin James in the lead.  He has such sublime physical comedy that is matched by his ability to make his every word (even his manner of speech) genuinely funny.  I think that is why I loved his pairing with Will Smith on `Hitch' so much.  They have very similar comedic styles; they both used every inch of their bodies to sell a character.  I've always loved the way Will Smith can contort his face to get a rise, and James does that to.  We so often mention dramatic actors and performances as telling a story with their eyes, of truly sinking into a feeling and emotion and just ravishing us with their stare; but the same can be said for a truly rewarding comedic performance as well.  Kevin James can crack a smile on anyone with just the expression on his face.

The rest of the cast is serviceable, but they really don't matter much when you consider the fact that this film rests firmly on Kevin's shoulders.

I definitely suggest this film for anyone who just wants to watch something funny, charming and entertaining.  `Paul Blart: Mall Cop' feels fresh and exciting and completely rewarding, which is not something that can easily be said for a film in this genre.  It's certainly not the best film of the year, or any other year for that matter; but for a somewhat mindless family fun escape from reality it does it's job and then some.  Maybe 5 stars is a bit much, but I can't think of a single negative thing to say and this movie.",1244419200,5,3517,4.362519201228879

3722564,2,B001NPD9RM,"Kevin James creates a lovable buffoon in this movie. The mustache works. His physical comedy works. I really feel sorry for the character because he gets dumped on by life. He flunked the state trooper exam because, he falls asleep when his blood sugar gets too low. Fairly inoffensive fat jokes fill the movie. For example, his boss says to him basically watch it, you make a big target. Paul Blart replies, ""I know.""  Some the gags work. The scene where Bart band-aids his small cut is a very funny spoof of the Rambo scene where Rambo sews up his own gaping wound. The attempted slide behind the pillar and then the scoots to get the rest of the way to behind the pillar is very funny as well. James is a surprisingly agile physical actor.

The plot of the movie is just a little strange and very formulaic. There are no surprises here and Kevin James has most of the jokes. The pathos at the start is laid on so thick that it dragged down the plot. The criminals are gymnastic wonders and not very believable. The movie never rises above itself like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or ""MeatBalls"" with the message that all misfits or nerds should hang together. The crime is averted and the boy gets the girl.

3722569,4,B001NPD9RM,"There's a certain reek of insignificance which comes with being a lowly rent-a-cop, an authority figure with no real authority (to paraphrase Kevin James, a mall cop or a security guard's strongest move is they gotta call the real police). And, if you're an overweight, klutzy, hypoglycemic mall security guard like Paul Blart (Kevin James), a whole new realm of pathetic is explored. Paul Blart is a guy who never made good. He is zero for eight in his tries at passing the physical exam for the New Jersey State Police. Still living with his mother, long abandoned by his wife (an illegal immigrant who only married him to get that Green Card), haplessly in crush with the girl at the hair accessories kiosk, and so down-and-out in his love life that his supportive young daughter coaxes him to sign up with an online dating service... Paul Blart is a loveable loser. But on Black Friday, the craziest shopping day of the year, as thieves overrun his mall and take hostages, Paul Blart gets a chance to be the hero. He's alone, tired, fat... and the only chance anyone has got.

PAUL BLART MALL COP may have been a surprising box office hit, but there's no denying its feel-good underdog appeal. I liked it enough and laughed plenty enough that I found it easy to overlook the plot inconsistencies and contrivances. I think it's worth 3.5 stars out of 5. In watching this one, it's fairly obvious that a homage is being paid to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>, with our much abused mall cop playing the part of John McClane. And like McClane, Blart as the eyes inside gets no respect from the arriving police officer in charge. Ditto treatment from the S.W.A.T. commander, who used to bully Blart back in school. Even Blart's supervisor is quick to caution him: ""I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. You're untrained. You're unarmed... Let's face it, son, you present a huge target.""

In DIE HARD Hans Gruber covets his lost detonator, which McClane had gotten a hold of. In this one Blart ends up with the credit card codes for the mall shops, something which the bad guy here originally had and now most desperately craves. So that's one more similarity. There's another moment which echoes a DIE HARD scene, the one with a near spent McClane taking time out to assess his wounds. Except that in Blart's case, his booboo is salved with a kid's bandaid. PAUL BLART MALL COP is a spoofy comedy, yet it's intelligently written enough that you do get invested in the story and its outcome. Kevin James tiptoes (heh!) the line between comedy and pathos. He handles plenty of his own stunts and demonstrates unexpected grace and physicality and some very good pratfalls and slapstick, his character consistently landing himself in very embarrassing predicaments. Blart tends to be officious and overzealous when on the job, traits that are offset by his inherently kind nature and big, big heart. Kevin James makes absolutely sure that the movie audience is on Blart's side, even if it means that Blart gets bagged on by the really obnoxious pen salesman or beat up by a *ahem* whole lot of woman.

Note that Blart's Segway personal transporter qualifies almost as an extension of our hero's character, much like Indiana Jones's hat helped to flesh out that guy's persona. I wonder how long it took James to get familiar with motoring on the Segway, because he looks very, very comfortable on that thing. Two things which also work are Blart's relationship with his chubby, optimistic daughter and his clumsy wooing of Amy, the hair extension kiosk girl (her kiosk is called ""Unbeweavable""). Although, admittedly, I pretty much cringed thru all those painfully awkward conversations between him and Amy. The film does a nice job of ensuring that the character moments are laid in before introducing the action/suspense plot. The action sequences, when they do come, are well executed, giving the fat man good opposition in the shapes of athletic perps who flaunt X Games skills (and even parkour). Paul Blart manages to turn the mall's resources to his advantage and to confound the baddies, even if the methods he applies are ridiculously implausible. The movie is all very silly, but presented in such an engaging manner that I couldn't help but be entertained. I certainly wouldn't say no to a sequel.

The mild DVD bonus stuff includes the following: mildly amusing audio commentary by Kevin James & producer Todd Garner; ten weak deleted scenes (Blart gets photographed for his online dating profile; Blart and the S.W.A.T. guy, in pursuit; muttering cleaning custodian; a lost little boy; a quick bar chatter; bad guy explaining the importance of the credit card codes; criminal mastermind chastises a henchman; Paul needs to translate a cell phone text message; Pahud & Paul chatting on the celly; Blart is attacked with snowglobes); and the following mostly self-explanatory featurettes: ""Kevin James: Not Your Average Mall Cop""; ""Action Sports Junkies"" & ""Stunts"" - these two segments are pretty cool, featuring real life X Gamers who played the bad guys in this film and their stunts, and also stunts by Kevin James; ""The Mall""; and ""On Set with Mike 'Rooftop' Escamilla"" (Escamilla is an actor/BMX stuntguy).",1243728000,,5314,5.014722536806342

MALL COP

I am a huge fan of Kevin James and own everything that he has been a part of that has been released; of course you know that I loved this film. The best thing about his film is that the whole family can watch and enjoy it. There have been many things said about this film but when it comes down to it this is still one of the highest grossing films of the year, a number one hit at the box office, and a successful DVD. Kevin James [star/writer/producer] teams up once again with friend Adam Sandler [producer] and his Happy Madison Productions to bring us this delightful movie.

Paul Blart is a shopping mall security guard in real life but in his head he wants to be a State Trooper but there is one thing holding him back, his hypoglycemia. Still he takes his day job very seriously, a little too much even. He also seems to have trouble with the ladies [his date video on the internet is hilarious] and one lady in particular, Amy. He also has a nice mother and daughter who seem to always try to hook him up with people over the internet. Any way one day while on the job a group of well lets just say crooks and they have a plan to make some good money, or steal, whatever. The only thing they didn't count on was an overweight, hypoglycemic, takes his job real serious mall cop named Paul Blart.

The thing about this film is that it is a certain type of humor, Kevin James type of humor. Me personally I loved this film as did my bro and girl, even though this is a PG film meant for family viewing. Saying that seems weird because it is a Happy Madison film but it really is ok for all ages in my opinion. Also I think it was cool how the villains in this were real life skaters, bikers, and free runners, it actually made a lot of sense. Part of their deal is they have multiple credit card numbers to get from each store. It is a big mall and a two level one at that, in order to get the numbers before they switch they need to get to each store as quick as possible. I don't know but I kinda liked all the action these guys brought to the film, got to try that free runner thing.

Producer/writer/star Kevin James is great in this film and funny as ever mixing in physical humor with some funny lines. James who has never given a weak performance in my opinion brings an every man feel to the character making it easier for you to rout for him. Also on a side note MMA LEGEND BAS RUTTEN makes an appearance at the beginning of the film as the instructor on the course. Keir O'Donnell was funny as the lead villain in the mall and to be honest it caught me off gaud with that character. Jayma Mays is good in this as well and not to mention easy on the eyes. Raini Rodriguez surprised me in this as Paul's daughter, great performance. Shirley Knight as his mom, Adam Ferrara, and of course Allen Covert are excellent in this as well even in smaller parts. Gary Valentine [Danny from King of Queens] is hilarious in his cameo as the karaoke singer, in fact I liked every one in this film.

Now I know what you are thinking ""this guy just loves Kevin James"" and while that is true I genuinely liked this movie, I got the humor I guess. I know people who didn't really get into this and that is cool to each his own, but I felt the movie was rather entertaining. From the insane action from the villains to the comedic moments involving James this film was truly entertaining. And if that wasn't enough this DVD has some great special features including a look at the skater, bikers, and free runners [really interesting] and what they do for a living. Also there is a great commentary with James and one of the producers.

Kevin and writing partner Nick Bakay did a great job as did director Steve Carr because they were not afraid to push this PG film out, and how successful it was at the box office. You know we were there opening day and of course at midnight the day the DVD was released I had to be there to own it. Sure I am a huge fan but the more I support people I like the more they will keep putting out. This is a great film in my opinion and well worth a purchase.",1243555200,,4109,4.162264150943396
3722573,4,B001NPD9RM,"Let's get one thing straight, if there's no Kevin James, there's no Paul Blart or 150 million the movie made in the theater. Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a family film purely for families, and although it's painful/boring in the first half, but the second half redeems the movie because who is set up as the stereotypical loser becomes a hero when he takes on a group of robbers on Thanksgiving night. Hilarity and fun of course ensues, and this film will leave any family with smiles on their faces. It's better than you'll expect, and there's some plot twists you won't expect.

Some other elements I liked included Keir O' Donnell who does a great job as Veck Simms, the criminal mastermind. I also enjoyed the various X-gamers, although Jason Ellis' role in the movie was too small. Although this fact is remedied in the behind the scenes and deleted scenes on the DVD. And of course, Kevin James really makes the movie as he plays the classic lovable hero. The underrated Jayma Mays was also lovely as always.

Overall, is it the best movie ever? No, but it's a great pick for family movie night for both the adults and kids. The first half could have been better, but taken as is, Paul Blart is a great little film the whole family will enjoy. It's at least worth a rental.",1243468800,,1274,4.487068965517241
3722574,1,B001NPD9RM,"""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" is the boilerplate for the security officer with dreams of becoming a cop. That's not the problem!  Except, for a few (very few) scenes, the movie is largely unfunny. The movie actually takes away from the comedy of Kevin James.  It tries to follow themes reminiscent of core American values: Diversity in relationships, the responsibility of the single father, pining for the ideal woman and the ""Average Joe"" saves the day by outwitting the villain.  So why doesn't it work?

Essentially, the movie fails because it insists on being a movie that the family can enjoy. It makes sweeping assumptions about the contemporary family in ways that appear to be pandering.  It's immature even for children. It doesn't excite, motivate nor esteem a guy down on his luck.  In fact, you don't root for him, because he's his own worst enemy. He isn't decisive, manly or compelling as a character. You may say,  ""It's mere entertainment and not meant to be anything, but mindless humor."" Maybe that's we're the splintering occurs. Humor should never be mindless.

Don't waste your money or your time on this movie.

3722577,3,B001NPD9RM,"As my wife and I watched this film tonite we kept commenting to each other on how obviously the Die Hard series inspired much of Paul Blart: Mall Cop.  Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company seems to have fairly liberally borrowed elements of the Die Hard series to come up with a comedic tale of a down on his luck, overweight, wannabe New Jersey State Trooper that just couldn't quite make it through the academy thanks to his battle against hypoglycemia.

Sandler buddy Kevin James (previously paired with Sandler in the comedy Chuck and Larry) plays the title role here and does it primarily in a serious style.  Yes there are laughs, and yes James produces them, but for the most part James plays the part seriously while the humor goes on around him.

Mall Cop did relatively well in theatres even though it's rating seems to fall about where I've placed it here.  What that seems to show is that the movie going public was hungry for family friendly comedy that this film happened to be released in perfect time for.  There's nothing wrong with this film, and yes it will entertain viewers, but there's really nothing that would set this film at the top of the category either.

The video quality on the Blu-ray is good, though for much of the film it seems you'll be watching commercials for all of the well placed goods and store fronts that are featured (on product placement alone the film should have made plenty of money).  Again, given the amount of product placement you'd have to expect that the picture quality would be very good and it is.  Anything less wouldn't highlight the goods well enough to let viewers see the product logos.

Audio quality is also good with a soundtrack that features several classic rock and roll performances.  If you can imagine the music of the era that was targeted in The Wedding Singer, you'd probably be in the right ballpark.  Think Money, Eddie; Survivor; Bon Jovi and others.

Personal opinion, for most potential viewers this is probably rental material.  It is certainly family friendly, and given the right audience there's probably a little extra value with the soundtrack, but teens through thirtysomethings may look at this film and be somewhat bored.",1243209600,2,2221,4.780104712041885
3722578,4,B001NPD9RM,"For years, I was a HUGE fan of the sitcom The King of Queens in which Kevin James was co-star and executive producer.

So I was very excited when I begin seeing trailers for a new movie starring James: Paul Blart Mall Cop.

Paul Blart is a overweight, lonely single father looking for love while eager to join the forces of the New Jersey State Police. Unfortunately, the effects of hypoglycemia keeps squashing those dreams.

In the meantime, Paul Blart works as a security guard at the West Orange Pavillion Mall, where he takes his job very seriously.

And when a group of thieves takes over the mall along with hostages, Paul Blart decides he will defend his mall; a place that he swore to protect (even if it was a personal oath sworn only to himself).

This is an outrageously funny movie. Seldom do I find comedy to be as funny as they once were, but this movie kept me laughing through out.

3722579,2,B001NPD9RM,"I was excited to see Paul Blart: Mall Cop, staring Kevin James. The movie made a lot of money during its post Christmas release and seemed to be a perfect movie for the family on a Saturday night. I was somewhat wrong. The kids enjoyed it, and it kept me entertained, but it really was a bad movie.

The good: This is a family movie, with only a few mild bad words, no graphic violence and no sex or innuendo. When a movie is that family friendly, you realize they made a concerted effort to do so, so you have to give them credit. Kevin James does his best to liven up a tame movie. He goes all out on the slap stick. The comedic take on the Die Hard plot of a lone wolf going against a team of criminals is somewhat funny.

The bad: Nothing about the plot is believable. Blart's home life is sad, his status as a mall cop on a Segway is silly, but the real disappointment comes when the bad guys invade the mall. If you watch, you'll see how the movie just went through the motions in creating a scenario in which Kevin James could do his thing. I guess that's fine in a slapstick comedy, but not so good if you're trying to draw the viewer into the movie.

I can't realy recommend you buy this movie. All the good parts really were in the preview. On the other hand, it is okay to watch with the entire family, which puts it on a pretty short list. After just watching Night at the Museum 2 last night, there is a big difference in the two family comedies. Museum is much better.",1243036800,,1482,4.1211072664359865

3722581,2,B001NPD9RM,"Like others here, i absolutely love Kevin James and continuously bust a gut at ""King of Queens"" episodes. Im so glad that Adam Sandler has given him a chance at being the main man on the big screen.

The movie did well, and thats a good thing because that means we'll get to see more of Kevin James in the future. Its also a bad thing because if he gets mired down in more of the silly but unfunny Sandler productions, then it probably won't get any better than ""Mall Cop"".

Adam Sandler hasn't known funny in a long time, but his ego won't allow him to see otherwise so he'll continue catering to the 10-year old crowd with his brand of silly adolescent humor.

Kevin James was his funniest when he would do the stupidest things on ""Queens"". You could feel a good screw-up coming and James was always there to deliver in the most foolish way possible. His stupidity though shone brightly with the extremely intelligent scripts of the series. Stupid is hilarious, but only when done with that hidden behind the scenes intelligence.

With pretty much any comedy nowadays, stupid is just stupid but not really funny unless, again, you're a 10 year old. Can Kevin make it in a smarter, but funnier comedy? He did it wonderfully in his show, but hes got to get away from Sandler if hes gonna make something, ahem, actually funny.

Im pulling for the guy, hes won first place on likability. Now if he can only find some good writers so he can find that special funny hes had for years now.

OK, I know, giving this film a 5 star rating is a stretch, but I felt it has gotten some unfair bashing. As family films go, it works very well and never seemed to be too corny or offensive. I think this film will also be better with repeat viewings.

I loved the contrast between the sluggish, but lovable lug James and the nimble extreme sports super team who were plotted against him. It's almost a parody of the action movie classic 'Die Hard'! It's all played for laughs, but I couldn't help thinking this film might have worked straight.

There is a scene that I found totally unnecessary and too violent for the tone of this film. There are three delted scenes that would have been better in place of it and it would have made this an even better film.

The one scene involving the fight between Paul and a woman at Victoria Secrets seemed out of place.

3722590,4,B001NPD9RM,"It isn't often that a movie comes out that actually makes me laugh out loud, but with Kevin James behind Paul Blart as creator and star, Mall Cop fulfills its promise to entertain.

Mall Cop isn't necessarily a movie intended for the entire family, as there is frequent use of mild profanity, but there was nothing else I could find of offense in the movie. About the first half of the movie is much like watching the Kevin James hit TV series, King of Queens, as Paul Blart is very much the same character as Doug Heffernan. At times during the first half of the movie, I found my mind wondering just a bit, or found myself not too disappointed when distracted by something my son would say or do. But about half way through the movie, when the action really kicked in and we get to see James playing the role of Paul Blart a la John McClane of Bruce Willis' Die Hard fame, I found myself engrossed.

Imagine Die Hard meets Homer Simpson, and you'll get a pretty accurate picture of what Paul Blart lives through in his dedication to defend the people of his mall against the invading force of a band of Black Friday thugs out to steal thirty million dollars worth of the credit card transactions on the busiest shopping day of the year. And just like Homer Simpson, Paul Blart manages to pull through in the end.

While I don't recommend Paul Blart Mall Cop for the entire family, it is harmless and enjoyable fare for viewers over the age of twelve or thirteen. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in I don't know how long.

3722592,4,B001NPD9RM,"Was dragged to this (complaining bitterly) by my child, and have now dragged other adults to it three times.  The appeal of this movie for me (NOT a slapstick fan) was the unexpected, fascinating and touching chemistry between Kevin James (Paul) and Jayma Mays (Amy).  Paul reminds me of Forrest Gump, whose blunders manage to turn out well in the end because his motivations are pure.  Jayma Mays does a great job of playing a woman who is both sexy and angelic without making her seem like a bimbo.  Raini Rodriguez is refreshing as a normal American adolescent, sensitive and glamourless.

  There was a moment at the end of the film, when Paul turns toward the camera, with purpose, to claim Amy, that took my breath.  As I left the theatre after one showing, I saw a guy who physically looked something like Paul Blart, with tears streaming down his face.  The man's wife greeted him outside the theatre doors with a wry and amazed, ""That bad, huh?""

  The characters and performances make this a memorable film... given that it's unabashedly slapstick comedy, it's something of a miracle.",1242691200,,1094,4.76063829787234
3722593,1,B001NPD9RM,"This movie is yet another prime example as to why I no longer go to the movies (in addition to the outrageous price and my boycott of the MPAA). The preview looks good and the concept sounds great, what movie that involves the mall, teenagers or high school sucks? If we're talking about anything from the 80s or 90s or even a select few from this last decade, not many. Mall Cop sucks.

For one, it's high predictable about 15 minutes in. We all know what is going to happen and how. This, in my opinion, is not necessarily a fault as it's the journey, not the predictable ending, that matters. We all know our life will end in death but it's the journey that counts. The journey of our Mall Cop is atrociously hard to watch.

The movie takes place entirely in the mall and what feels like a single day (The film is poorly edited, just moments after the opening you'll be wondering how we got from police training to mall cop). Personally I disdain single-day films and while the plot doesn't take place in a single day it certainly feels it. The single location of the mall doesn't help either.

The movie feels very flat and go no where the entire length. Additionally, we have a love interest in the film which never feels quite right as the love interest looks half the age of Paul Blart with a future as opposed to Blart who could be her dad who never amounted to anything in his life.

About half way through the film I was asking myself: Am I suppose to feel sorry for Blart? I didn't feel sorry for Blart, in fact, I barely felt as if I known the character. The only person I felt anything for was the love interest of Blart who in this day and age would be a victim. I felt as though she was being stalked and harassed by this old loser mall cop. I felt sorry for the mall as well.

The movie has no basis of reality in it either which wouldn't be a bad thing if the plot was able to pull it off or if even Kevin James could pull it off without appearing to be deliberately acting which he can't.

All in all, PLEASE do not waste your time on this film. I didn't even want to write a review for this but seeing the unbelievable stars this film has I felt it necessary. I honestly cannot see how anyone could find this film the slightest bit enjoyable.",1242000000,4,2261,4.210161662817552
3722594,5,B001NPD9RM,This movie became a sleeper hit as a low budget film turned blockbuster with $176 million worldwide I like this movie when I first seen the TV spots for Paul Blart Mall Cop I really wanted to see this movie which I did. I want to see this movie about two more times I like this Die Hard in a mall idea as a family movie with Kevin James as the title role I can't tell you about the movie go buy this movie on Blu-ray or Dvd and you love this blockbuster hit.,1241827200,2,458,3.882978723404255
3722595,5,B001NPD9RM,"I went to see this with a bunch of teenage girls and we all laughed until we cried. It's a good, clean, hillarious story. Just the thing to make you laugh at a time when we so often need to escape the seriousness of the real world.",1241308800,3,231,3.9361702127659575
3722596,2,B001NPD9RM,"This film about a loveable loser mall security guard made Seth Rogen's ""Observe & Report"" look like comedy genius.  ""Blart's"" nonsensical plot (guys on skateboards and BMX bikes take over a mall) seems aimed at the 10-18 crowd who are meant marvel at the cool yet totally ridiculous stunts and to laugh at the different ways Kevin James can make fun of the fact he's obese. Plus there's an over abundance of bad late 70s/early 80s rock songs.

File this mall cop malady one under: Avoid & Evade.",1241222400,2,495,4.613636363636363
3722597,4,B001NPD9RM,"I love it when people get so serious over a movie which is clearly meant to be fun! Obviously anyone who saw this will agree the acting wasn't stellar & the story was hokey by all means, but come on, based on the material it was clearly meant to be a movie to get some laughs & make you feel good. What I really liked about Paul Blart was that Kevin James showed more of a serious & even tender side to himself which we never really got to see in his TV show The King of Queens...you really wanted to see his character become truly happy in life & become the hero he always dreamed of being. And if you are a fan of The King of Queens then you also appreciate the fact that Kevin James had used some people from the show in the movie so there is a level of comfort to add to the story. All in all a very enjoyable movie if you are a fan of Kevin James & his goofball sense of humor. **Oh yeah & as a side note, the soundtrack was full of rockin tunes as well especially with the track 'Can't Hold Back' from Survivor. I had the Greatest Hits from them for a while now & I never really noticed that track until I saw this movie & I love it now!",1239494400,,1143,3.888888888888889

I saw this movie and realized that this is the type of movie where you are just looking for laughs and don't care much about the story.  Basicly, Kevin James is a corny mall cop who gets in over his head doing his job.  I thought Kevin James was funnier in Chuck and Larry, but I did enjoy this movie.  I recommend it as a date movie or if you want to laugh a lot.",1234656000,3,446,3.8152173913043477
