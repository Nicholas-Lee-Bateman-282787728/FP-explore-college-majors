7431475,4,B01595QPQ8,"I am very much looking forward to the first season of this period drama. The costumes look first rate, the actors simply draw you in, until you believe you are sitting in their rooms watching their lives unfold.",1473033600,,211,4.578947368421052
7431476,5,B01595QPQ8,I had to return it because it would not work in mud do player. I am very disappointed!,1471651200,,86,3.8333333333333335
7431477,4,B01595QPQ8,"Skullduggery, rampant sex, sibling rivalry, outrageous wigs  this is the superstylish new interpretation of Louis XIVs court that boasts the worst scripts and the most gorgeous costumes imaginable. There is much walking about from lavish room to lavish room, wooden acting by many in the cast but tremendous performances by George Blagden as the Sun King and Alexander Vlahos as his hapless younger brother Philippe. I must admit that the first season of this high-camp romp has been my guilty pleasure.",1470873600,8,503,5.209876543209877
7431478,5,B01595QPQ8,Loved it!  Can't wait to order the second season.,1469059200,,49,4.444444444444445
7431479,5,B01595QPQ8,"This is by far the most enticingly sexy account of the truth. I CAN NOT wait for season 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10...When, please don't make me wait!",1468281600,10,152,3.6363636363636362
7431480,5,B01595QPQ8,I received the DVD set much earlier than expected from France. You will need a region free DVD player to see it.,1460678400,2,112,4.136363636363637
7431481,5,B01595QPQ8,"George Blagden, who played the priest Athelstan in Vikings, here stars in a less spiritual role as Louis XIV, known as the Sun-King. In Season 1, Louis's dream is to shift the center of government and the power base from Paris to Versailles, which is to be built to house a gigantic court filled with often rebellious nobles who must be made submissive to the king's rule.  Unfortunately, Louis soon finds that a group of nobles secretly plot against him and include some closest to the crown. No one is safe, with highwaymen attacking coaches to and from Versailles, while poisoners and other murderers operate undetected within the palace walls. Since Louis was also a great womanizer, throw in various sex scenes and a few orgies to lighten an otherwise fearful mood. Then throw in some international intrigues concerning other power-hungry monarchs. This entertaining series ends with a large cliffhanger, but you'll have to hold your breath until Season 2, which started filming in January, 2016. The series is visually stunning and sumptuous, with fine performances, especially from Blagden in this challenging role of someone forced by circumstances to be a ruthless tyrant one moment and a sympathetic ruler the next.",1460160000,26,1225,5.0945273631840795

I was easily able to get current on the series with this purchase, since all of the episodes from the first season were not available to watch on television at the time I wanted to start my binge.

7431489,1,B01595QPQ8,I couldn't even get through the first episode.  It is terrible in just about every way possible.  Amazon has already wasted considerable time and money on this.  Do not waste yours.  If you are interested in a history-based series try The Crown (on Netflix).,1516233600,,258,4.795454545454546

ENOUGH SAID!!!!!!!  just like GOT, except WORSE because there's no breaks of the stupidity and drama.  WHO FREAKING CARES about power... IF U CARE ABOUT POWER THEN U ACTUALLY LIKE THIS  S*** ,  WHICH MEANS......THE ONLY THING YOU LOVE IS YOURSELF,  MONEY, FAME & CONTROLLING OTHER PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL!!!!!!!",1514592000,,660,4.918181818181818

7431499,5,B01595QPQ8,"Thoroughly enjoyed this show. The beautiful set designs and costumes transform the viewer to 1600s France. Don't be put off with the frequent (and largely gratuitous) sex scenes. The scripted  plot and actors truly deliver to create a remarkable show filled with passion, strife and intrigue.",1513382400,,292,5.3478260869565215
7431500,5,B01595QPQ8,Entertaining and a great try for historical accuracy. It's fun to watch the confluence of historical accuracy and artistic license.  Great Show,1513296000,,143,5.5

7431523,1,B01595QPQ8,"Worst writing, editing and storytelling I've ever watched. Can't comment on the acting because I stopped watching after E2. How on earth does this stuff get made? There had to be a pretty big budget but where did the money go? Not to the creative side, that's for sure.",1501372800,,269,4.510204081632653
7431524,2,B01595QPQ8,Every kind of sex imaginable - but very little plot.,1500854400,,52,4.3
7431525,5,B01595QPQ8,"NOT entirely historical non-fiction. It is loosely based on the real Louis XIV. Most stuff is biographical, but most definitely a make belief tale of what it could/should have been like.
For starters, the Bourbons are historically known for not being too good looking, at least certainly not as gorgeous as George Bladgen and Alexander Vlahos, who are HOT.
Read Antonia Frasier and Nancy Mitford if you have issue with this.
I loved this show and I would want it to last 50 seasons.",1500595200,2,482,4.75
7431526,1,B01595QPQ8,Mature audience must mean soft porn. Within the first 5 minutes of the first episode you are subjected to two separate scenes that are rated X (in my opinion).  This suggests the show lacks substance or a story worth telling. There appears to be no way to return this video once purchased.,1500076800,3,289,4.5576923076923075

7431528,5,B01595QPQ8,As a history buff I have been able to go back and read the historical situations that play out in the series. I have plowed through series 1  and 2 and need to keep myself busy while waiting for season 3!,1499126400,,204,3.975609756097561
7431529,1,B01595QPQ8,"I should know better.  But this is loaded with unnecessary sex and is just gross.  I don't mind sex here and there if it fits in with the story line.  But this just seemed too much and in your face right away.  I'm sure the French court was this way, but I don't need to see every sexual encounter ever had back then.  I couldn't even finish the first episode or get into the storyline.  It was just wayyyy too much.",1498780800,4,416,4.074074074074074
7431530,5,B01595QPQ8,"This is a fantastic series. The acting is superb, the costuming is amazing and who could go wrong with the set. It follows historical events pretty closely. BBC has a segment that follows each episode to go over what is and is not accurate which is awesome if you can find it online somewhere called ""Inside Versailles"" Love!!",1498521600,,326,4.637931034482759
7431531,1,B01595QPQ8,"We could not make it through the first episode of this series, due to the sadistic and violent beatings that are shown and the frequent sex scenes.  We were expecting a romantic, dramatic period piece in the 'Downton Abbey' style, and was totally turned off by the senseless violence and sex.",1498348800,2,292,4.7254901960784315
7431532,5,B01595QPQ8,"Having watched Versailles on BBC, I then purchased Versailles Season 1 from Amazon.fr so that I could watch with the French soundtrack and the subtitles also in French. One thing puzzles me. The Amazon.fr version is different from the English BBC version - in fact, a completely different story also obviously still based on the story of Versailles and Louis X1V. George Blagden plays Louis in both versions and some of the others actors appear in both but not all of them.  The Amazon.fr is even better than the English version even if you don't play it in French, although there is more violence and more explicit sex scenes.  I wrote a review also on Amazon.fr but unfortunately, no-one commented on it. Please can someone explain to my why there are two versions of Versailles and George Blagden appears as Louis in both...",1497571200,2,827,4.776223776223776

7431534,5,B01595QPQ8,"I was a huge fan of the Tudors and at first had a hard time with the series, I mean the sex was over the top, gay sex, oral sex, too much sex. But once that calmed down and it did lessen somewhat I was enthralled by the depth of the characters portrayed and lavish time in history. I wound up being a fan of this series and am waiting...... please more please! I'm having withdrawal and need season 2 Amazon!",1496102400,3,408,4.049382716049383
7431535,1,B01595QPQ8,"This starts with Louis sleeping in what was only later on his majestic bedroom, which, at the time was not yet the Versailles posterity learned to admire.  Also, Louis was NOT king when he was 4 years old.  And his mother died when he was already 25 years old, and not the adolescent they show in his dream.  I found it sickening that he had his s*men cleaned off his belly at the beginning of the movie.  Ten minutes into it and about 25% of the time it was basically porn.  Yes, we know people had sex, OK, we get it.  But one must decide: either this is going to be an historical portrayal (even if somewhat fictionalized) or a porn movie.  They decided for a third option: completely fictionalized, historically inaccurate and bad soft-porn.  At least sell it as such, don't fool customers!",1495324800,4,794,4.465277777777778

7431613,5,B01595QPQ8,"This is an excellent series. I love historical dramas and this is so close to the real story, only with a few minor theatrical changes and interpretations of events. The acting is superb. Despite what I keep reading in critical articles, the sex and violence in the series is very minimal compared to game of thrones and the walking dead. In watching all 10 episodes, I only saw 2 full nude sex scenes and one completely graphic violent scene with an eye taken out of its socket. Other than that there is blood and a few fighting scenes but no more than day time television. Be advised there is a trigger warning, a baby is saved from death and there is an implied rape scene. Neither was done graphically, it was implied. Those scenes added to the story and its done with taste. I can not wait for season 2, although it might be a while before its available in America. Its one of those shows where you need to watch the next episode asap. There must not be a lot of commercials during European television shows because each episode was an hour long without any cut aways, unlike American shows that run in an hour slot, but are actually only 20-25 minutes because of commercials. Some have choppy cut aways because of the length of our commercials as well. The last episode is a cliff hanger and since season 2 starts 4 years later I  guess it will be addressed as a past event. boo. Definitely watch if you can.

Season 1, which begins in 1667 a year after the death of the 28-year-old monarchs beloved mother Anne of Austria, explores Louiss rivalry with his tormented brother Philippe (Alexander Vlahos).

This was a king who had a schoolboy arrested (and said lad was still in prison in old age) when someone overheard him joke about his bald head.

7431665,5,B01595QPQ8,"Okay first - to those who've complained it's not historically accurate, they're right. It's not. But, it's not billed as a documentary. It's an entertainment series. To quote Grandma when we complained about movie/show accuracy in the past, ""It's just a movie!!"" I'm very familiar with the history of France and what is now considered the U.K. When I started watching this, I shelved what I knew about this French monarchy so I could enjoy the series. Like Reign (or the Tudors for that matter) - most certainly NOT anything like Mary Stuart's actual life. Henry's life painted in the Tudors might be closer to fact, the mas WAS a dog, lol. Again, both skewed in fact, BUT enjoyable nonetheless. As long as you remember - it's entertainment. Not learning.

Now mentioning the Tudors series, I was worried Versailles would be another porn lite historical fiction series. Like hey, Skinemax wants their niche back! Yes, everyone bonked everyone. We know this, doesn't mean everyone wants to watch it. The first few episodes I was like, ""S***, put away the boobs!!"" But after they got that over and done with, I really enjoyed it. The latter part of the series is heavily focused on court politics, plots, and intrigue. Which was their lives, and I think this series does a good job illustrating that. Along with the real life struggle Louis had being ""THE SUN"" and being ""the man"".

It's unique, and it has a kind of charm that suits the subject. This may make no sense to most readers, but I would describe it as _The Hairdresser's Husband_ meets _Queen Margot_, meets _The Tudors_ . If  beautiful fops making red-heeled hanky panky make you uneasy, I . . . err . . . can't imagine you will be open to the charm of this wonderful show. Try Miller: lesser curtains, better caps.  If David Ball, Susan Carroll, Phillipa Gregory and Margaret George help you shed a day's stressors before bed-if you have seen _Wings of the Dove_ and _The House of Mirth_  more than twice ( no need to say which versions)-if  you admired Vlahos in Merlin and saw how Medieval  the loss of Blagden was to Vikings,  wait until you see them together here.

I happen to be a Tudor buff and prefer my Tudor history a bit more realistic.  For example, I am disturbed that the actor who plays Henry VIII on ""The Tudors"" has dark hair, when all us Tudor buffs know he had red hair!  But, since I am NOT a Bourbon buff, I can enjoy the voluptuous sex and lurid violence on ""Versailles"" without worrying about hair color.  I must confess that I prepared for this series with a couple of Wikipedia articles and two BBC documentaries (not to mention a review in The Guardian), but, apart from that, I just let it rip!

 I got my ""A"" in AP European History a long time ago, and by now I've forgotten half the stuff I memorized back then.  So each week I look forward to ""Versaille's"" glam vision of royal and aristocratic butts and boobs, along with visions of marble, mirrors, satin and lace, as a scrumptious desert that need have no historical ""nutritional value.""  On these terms, the show is great.  If you're still in school, you had better supplement ""Versailles"" with the heavy, scholarly stuff.

If you enjoy this sort of thing, I think you will be very happy with this series about the rise and reign of Louis Quattorze.

7431711,5,B01595QPQ8,"Bravo! Daring, well acted. Fast paced, exciting. Series initially broadcast in France by Canal+, bold enough to uncover myth behind Louis' XlV's wife, Queen Marie Theresa of Spain's affair with Prince Aniaba, heir to the throne of Assinie (Cte d'Ivoire).

Clever dramatization exposes this famous cover-up. In 1664, the mixed race baby daughter of the Spanish born Queen Maria Theresa's baby (claimed dead at birth), aptly named Louise Marie-Thrse, is sent to a convent to be raised as a nun.

Though ""Versailles"" the series may not re-address this story line, it is quite interesting. Acknowledged by several famous French writers, including Voltaire, in her adult life the black baby Louis sent to the nunnery is known as ""La Mauresse de Moret"". She received a generous lifelong pension directly from Louis XIV. In letters, she addressed Louis ""Le Grand Dauphin"" as ""brother"".

In the third episode of ""Versailles"" keeping his wife's black illegitimate daughter Marie-Thrse alive in the nunnery provides Louis XiV powerful political and financial leverage over Prince Aniaba and Assinie. After news of the death of his father, he is now the new King of Assine; Aniaba signs a treaty with Louis on his visit to Versailles. The unspoken gestures, portrait and deliberate ""cruel but kind"" treatment of Prince Assine make sense by the end of this episode. Assine is told the British and Dutch would have killed Prince Aniaba for this. He is taken to the nunnery, where it all makes sense. The little person is not the father, as many may have thought...

Louis XlV's lifelong obsession with impressing the world by transforming the ""nice house"" in Versailles into an opulent palace and display of wealth is certainly not underplayed. How else could Louis fund 35,000 workers but with gold mined in Assinie? Excellent series, for lovers of historical dramas, this is well worth watching!",1477180800,13,1884,5.107142857142857

7431717,4,B01595QPQ8,"Finally, streaming on Amazon is Versailles.  The first few episodes are up to devour.  New episodes are posted weekly.  Is it worth watching? Absolutely.

Versailles begins in 1667 with the 28-year old King Louis XIV on the throne. Tired of Paris, he wishes to remove himself and build his kingdom palace at Versailles, which was once a hunting lodge.

The series introduces you into the maturing young king as he attempts to control the nobility who are against him and establish his power in France.  As any other reign, his bid for supremacy is threatened by those who would overthrow him.  The life at court is filled with the usual intrigue that includes those loyal and those disloyal to the throne.

What makes this show work for me is George Blagden, who plays the young Louis XIV. He is the center stage in the entire production, playing a convincing role of a young monarch who is coming into his own among the wolves who surround him. At first, he appears unsure of himself, and then as time progressives, he shows that he can be as ruthless as his enemies, tender as any lover, and merciful when its to his advantage.  Blagden is a convincing monarch and a perfect choice for the role.

The costumes are lavish, the settings rich with grandeur, and the story believable though probably not one hundred percent historically accurate.

My only caution is beware of the over-the-top sexual scenes including the kings affairs with his mistresses and occasional intercourse with this wife. On the other side of the coin, there are homosexual scenes involving the kings brother, Philippe, Duke of Orleans, played by Alexander Vlahos. Sex is not a silent subject in this production.

The violence so far as been tame in comparison to other shows. It appears most of the intrigue is in the kings court and in the bed of the women he makes loves to, siring all sorts of children in his lifetime.

Nevertheless, if you're looking for a good period drama, I suggest you tune in and watch Versailles. Its enjoyable indeed to see the lavish lives of royalty before their subsequent generations lost their heads on the guillotine.",1476748800,17,2128,4.76566757493188

This is the tale of the sun king turning Versailles from a hunting lodge into the grand palace. He was an incredibly interesting king. The actor staring as him is perfect and mesmerizing in the role. All the acting is wonderful. Special mention also to the actor who plays the Prince. The writers have created three dimensional characters, in an amazing time and place.

Good things come to those who wait. Versailles is an excellent series. I imported the DVD from France and loved the show. But now I am happy we are finally getting the show in the US. Each episode is better than the next. The costumes are luxurious, the setting of the Palace is magnificent and  most importantly the characters are complex and rich. Look forward to it and know there is more coming...series 2 was already filmed!",1475193600,48,939,4.517647058823529

7431747,5,B01595QPQ8,"When I saw this series advertised and not showing here in US until Oct. '16, I ordered the series directly from Amazon UK.  Really enjoyed watching & was never bored-- the actor portraying  the brother was amazing.  As far as the sexual content-- have seen much much more on Game of Thrones but  the brother according to history was gay (or bi) so if this offends you-- be aware.  But this was still handle not that badly..  Anyway, I enjoyed it so far but I wished they had extended this season just a little more before ending this season-- just very glad there will be a season 2",1474848000,2,582,4.342592592592593

7431750,5,B01595QPQ8,"This is one of the very best historical series ever!!! The sets are fantastic, the costumes over the top.  This is 'House of Cards' in 17th century France. Rampant unbridled sex. Lying. Sex. Cheating. Sex. Murder. Plots.  Corruption.  Yep, House of Cards at Versailles!!! When, oh, when are they going to get Season Two?  I cannot wait for Season Two, Season Three!! Remember Downton Abbey went for six seasons and that was a simple English country house.  Not the center of an empire!",1473724800,16,485,4.795180722891566

7431752,5,B01595QPQ8,I am very much looking forward to this show and hope it has a release date soon.  The topic is about the building of Versailles and how passionate the King of France was about it.  It gives us a glimpse into the past.,1473379200,2,217,4.023255813953488

8733051,5,B01595QPQ8,"Lavishly mounted production depicting life among the Beautiful People at King Louis XIV's court. Expect: 1. Intrigue. 2. Graphic violence. 3. Naughty bedroom scenes approximately every fifteen minutes. 4. Gorgeous costumes, sets, and outdoor scenes filmed at the fabulous palace itself. The story focuses on the early years of the king's reign, when he first learned the wisdom of ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"". Louis accomplished this by constructing a palace huge enough to accommodate all his nobles and insisting they live there. Louis and his brother, the flamboyantly gay (but surprisingly good military leader) Philippe have a tempestuous love/hate relationship. Which reminds me of another thing to expect: lots of shouting matches between the two. The cast is made up of relatively unknown actors, who do a decent job, though the more seasoned actors really shine here, in particular Anatole Taubman as Montcourt, a gentleman of questionable origin who manages to be both groveling and duplicitous at the same time. This mini-series is not meant to educate, but to entertain. And that it does very well.",1531785600,,1133,5.3

8733054,2,B01595QPQ8,"This show is laughably gratuitous with the level of sex and violence. In most cases it does nothing to advance the plot. If I'm going to scar my psyche with something this graphic, the writing and acting better be on par with Game of Thrones or Black Sails and it just isn't. Add a half star for the woman in the opening scene being gorgeous.",1527724800,,342,4.276923076923077

8733056,4,B01595QPQ8,"These days they like to get the soft porn out of the way in the first few episodes. If you're squeamish, it's going to bug you. Too bad they think pandering to the lustful side of nature requires no mystery. Nope, its all there in your face. Prestige, Power, lust...Sickening really, but then after that, the shock value wears off and it's actually a good show. Just close your eyes on the parts that bug you or fast forward, and you'll be fine.",1525824000,,445,4.373493975903615
8733057,2,B01595QPQ8,"Season 1 and Season 2 are  High Camp.  Too High and Too Camp.  Too many sex scenes, too many torture scenes, too many knife fights, too many poisonings, too many people spitting up blood.  At some point, intelligent viewers begin to want to know more about the socio-economic realities of seventeenth-century French life that made Versailles possible and the French Revolution inevitable.  Season 1 and Season 2 deliver only cloying sensationalism.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous, but the characters are cardboard cutouts and the plot is aimless.  I'll see Season 2 through to the bitter end, but I'm not optimistic it will teach me anything much about a dynasty whose progeny hold positions of influence in Europe to this very day.",1523232000,,737,4.991803278688525
