3984445,5,B002TCRQ5Y,Excellent series.  Great interaction between the two detectives and the mysteries are great.  My only problem is that I can not access the subtitles and my hearing is less than perfect.  I really hate admitting that.,1260489600,,216,4.944444444444445
3984446,4,B002TCRQ5Y,"Great follow up to Morse, gets off to a bit of a slow start as far as character development. But that is not a bad thing! I very much appreciate that the series develops at a very realistic pace. By the end of epoisode 3, I was very pleased with the series.

The video quality is not so great. Loss of a star for that, otherwise it is great.

If you enjoyed Inspector Morse, this is the next step. I do like Morse better overall. There is no possible way to follow up on Thaw's portrayal of Morse. So, why try? This is a fresh series with many Morse references, but it never tries to be ""Morse Part 2"", rather this is its' own series. It is very well done and worth buying.",1331510400,,673,4.052631578947368
3984447,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"The Inspector Lewis series is a worthy heir to the tradition of Colin Dexter's Endeavour Morse.  The writing remains sharp, and the Oxford-area scenery brilliant.

3984448,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"British mysteries are usually sterling.  This collection is no less.  Every episode is worth repeated viewings.
I highly recommend this series.",1325376000,,143,5.761904761904762
3984449,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"I've never watched the original series as telecast in the UK, so I'm not able to comment on the editing done on the PBS Masterpiece Mystery series of DVDs. Having caught up with some of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).

The Pilot features DI Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) returning from abroad and getting involved in the investigation of the murder of a math student. His assistant is DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox), a theology graduate from Cambridge. Insp. Morse may no longer be with him, but let's just say he does help Lewis, and crosswords are involved!

In Series One, there are three riveting episodes set in Oxford:
Whom the Gods Would Destroy - When an Oxford don's former classmate is found murdered, he comes under suspicion, but Lewis and Hathaway need to tread with care given the sensitive nature of the case.

Old School Ties - Lewis is not happy when he is assigned ""babysitting"" duties with Hathaway. The celebrity in need of protecting is a reformed criminal turned celebrity author. When an attractive young student turns up dead, there are many suspects to choose from - her circle of collegemates who all seem to be rather ambivalent in their feelings toward the girl, and also the celebrity himself. When the celebrity himself ends up murdered, Lewis' past comes back in the attractive form of his ex-schoolmate and ex-girlfriend, who turns out to be the widower/ agent of the dead man.

Expiation - An apparent suicide of a North Oxford housewife perplexes Lewis. There was no suicide note, and the dead woman's life seemed too perfect to be true. Lewis and Hathaway dig deeper to get at the truth.

Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway.  There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.
Season 2 contains the following episodes:

And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.

Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elder gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?

Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.

The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?

Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.

The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.

The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.

I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals.",1323302400,,4500,4.85006518904824

And all the other characters, such as Dr. Hobson as a possible love interest for Inspector Lewis is great. It keeps you guessing. These shows aren't all about blood and guts like so many shows are now days and that's a huge plus for me. I like the backdrop of Oxford as well. It definitely adds to the scenery of all the episodes; you know all the litte nooks and crannies of the place.

3984462,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"I recently caught a couple of episodes of Season Three of Inspector Lewis on Masterpiece Mystery and I knew I had to get this DVD collection of the earlier two seasons so that I could catch up on the show since I liked the few episodes I saw. I have never seen the Inspector Morse series of the past but I look forward to seeing it in the future so I can see how the character of Inspector Lewis has developed.  The series takes place in Oxford, England and it begins with Inspector Lewis returning from a long term departure, after the death of his wife in a hit and run and the death of his long time partner Inspector Morse.  Inspector Lewis has to deal with the changing atmosphere of the force and finds himself with a younger brilliant but distant partner Detective Hathaway. The only thing that hasn't changed is human behavior as Oxford seems to be a flatbed for murders.

I really love Kevin Whately, I think he is an excellent actor and he plays his character so well.  I think the relationship he develops with Detective Hathaway (Lawrence Fox) is wonderful, they have such excellent chemistry that is really hard to find between two actors from different age groups. The tension is palpable when it needs to be and at times humor can be detected. They learn from each other and it is wonderful to watch.  I really love this series and would recommend it to others who have enjoyed similar mystery series on Masterpiece.",1294012800,4,1431,4.5096525096525095

3984465,3,B002TCRQ5Y,I enjoy these DVD's.  I am disappointed that the Closed captioning does not work in our TV.  It works for cable and other DVD's but does not work for Inspector Lewis.,1291939200,5,166,4.32258064516129
3984466,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"Having just caught season 3, I felt I was missing out on the previous seasons.  I now have the complete set, and I am fully enjoying it.  Done by PBS, I found no problems with sound quality or understanding the British accent as some have reported in previous reviews.  The background setting of Oxford and the surrounding country side is breathtaking, and the stories unfold generously and logically.  The partnering of Inspector Lewis and his Sergeant makes an intriguing combo.  Down to earth, street wise Lewis and a classically trained Sergeant who exhibits elitism and humility at the same time.  An undercurrent seems to pervade the series as upper and middle class clash in their perspectives of how the world should work.  Lewis finds privileges accorded the upper class often obstruct his pursuit of murder suspects, and while his partner is more understanding of that elitism, the Sergeant has a narrower definition of morality, having previously been a theology student.  I find the entire series beautifully done, while the stories tend to open more tantalizing sub plots as the shows develop to their conclusions.  The stories are well-done, and the acting is superb,",1290556800,,1181,5.077720207253886

3984468,4,B002TCRQ5Y,"Intelligent, lightly humorous, well-written and acted series from Granada and WGBH.

Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox are wonderful as Lewis and his assistant, Sergeant James Hathaway.  Lewis is an old-time copper with dogged determination and good instincts, while Hathaway is more intellectual and highly educated at Cambridge.  It also doesn't hurt that this young offspring of James Fox (brilliant in The Servant) is so easy on the eyes:  tall, slender, handsome, soft-spoken, red-haired, and very sexy.

The scripts are smart and the productions in and around Oxford are beautiful.  It is a series that grows on you in every way.

What is absolutely unacceptable, not to mention incredibly annoying, is to buy an expensive set like this and then be inundated with the same begging for money that you hear on PBS from morning till night in series after series.  There is no difference in this set than if you record it on Tivo:  silly introduction, solicitations before and after.

Fortunately I watched a couple of episodes from Netflix, saw how PBS ruined them, and proceeded to order the PBS-free ITV version from Amazon.uk.",1284595200,5,1129,5.086956521739131
3984469,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"Kevin Whately does not just continue on with Lewis, but has allowed his character to grow, mature and adapt to changes in the characters life.

This is a must see series for British mystery buffs.",1283644800,,359,4.625
3984470,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"I really like this new Series, however; my DVD player cannot display the Subtitles.  When I press the subtitle button I get a message that they are ""Off"".  I have a Sony Carousel player that is approximately 4 years old.  Any suggestions.  I really need CC or Subtitles (okay I am a little hard of hearing).",1283040000,5,307,4.428571428571429
3984471,4,B002TCRQ5Y,"This is a way above average British detective series.  The three scripts from Alan Plater,""Old School Ties,"" And The Moonbeams Kiss The Sea,"" and ""The Quality of Mercy are splendid.  The writing, directing, photography, and acting throughout the series are solid.

The reviewer who complained about losing some dialogue is on target, regretably.  Laurence Fox is not always easy to understand, and the music does get in the way at times.

""Life Born of Fire,"" is the low point in the series, being both ridiculous and politically correct.  ""The Great and The Good"" is simply unintelligible.

Another problem is the female boss.  When she isn't being shrewish toward the two detectives, she tries slightly to flirt.  For some reason she consistently wears unflattering clothes.

Is the box worth buying?  Absolutely.  But don't expect all of it to be on the Morse, Frost, Gently level.",1282780800,4,884,5.0625

3984473,4,B002TCRQ5Y,"These are not as good as the Inspector Morse mysteries because the main characters, Lewis and Hathaway, are not as compelling as Morse and Lewis.  But the mysteries are every bit as good, and in some cases better.  So if one is more interested in the plots than the characters, then this is for you.  Indeed, the episode ""And The Moonbeams Kiss The Sea"" has got to be one of the best I have ever seen.  The others are good, solid who done its with excellent cinematography.

What forces me to rate this a 4 instead of a 5 is the rather sloppy job done on the sound, which is poorly equalized and not normalized.  This makes it difficult to hear the actors talking clearly.  If one is used to British English, perhaps there is no problem, but Lewis talks like he has marbles in his mouth, and often mumbles.  I would often back up the DVD to catch what he was saying.  That is, by the way, the single biggest advantage of getting the DVDs.  The ability to back up and carefully listen to the words.

The plots are great, however.  I will get series 3 and 4 when they finally get around to releasing them.

Below is a list of what is on the DVDs:

0.  Pilot
 Lewis returns from overseas, having come to terms with the loss not only of Morse, but also of his wife Val (killed in a hit and run incident).

Series one

1. Whom The Gods Would Destroy
Lewis and Hathaway investigate a murder involving a group called the Sons of the Twice Born named after an epithet of Dionysus relating to his birth, whose activities are shrouded in Greek codes, quotes from Nietzsche and a Dionysian fondness for drugs.
2. Old School Ties
When an ambitious Oxford student is found dead in her hotel room after inviting a reformed computer hacker to speak at the Union, Lewis and Hathaway are called in to investigate. The pair are soon drawn into a case driven by celebrity, ambition and dangerous sexual politics, which strikes alarming chords with Lewis.
3. Expiation
Lewis and Hathaway investigate the alleged suicide of a housewife living in Summertown.

Series two

1. And The Moonbeams Kiss The Sea
Lewis and Hathaway investigate the death of a maintenance engineer found shot in the head in the basement of the Bodleian Library. A search of the dead man's house reveals a stash of valuable volumes and a connection to the local gamblers anonymous group, with further probing exposing a scam involving two Oxford academics.

2. Music To Die For
Lewis and Hathaway are called in to investigate a boxing scam, a close link to Lewis' old boss, Inspector Morse, and a love triangle linked to the Stasi.

3. Life Born Of Fire
Lewis investigates when a devout young Christian desecrates a church by committing suicide on its altar, claiming in a call to the police that it was ""murder"". Hathaway recognises him as Will McEwan, an old school friend. As the detectives delve deeper, a series of gruesome murders occur, all involving members of ""The Garden"", a modern Christian club, and Hathaway, who once trained for the priesthood, appears to know a lot more than he is willing to tell his boss.

4. The Great And The Good
Following the rape of a teenage girl, Lewis and Hathaway stumble across the curious private dinner parties of high school computer technician Oswald Cooper, who ends up being brutally murdered and castrated after entertaining several highly respected society figures.",1279238400,14,3369,4.625210084033614
3984474,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"To me Inspector Lewis is not only the best detective/crime solving show of all-time, but the best TV show. I have started to purchase the complete Inspector Morse series just so I can catch a young Detective Sergeant Lewis. Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway are great together. While they have completely different personalities, they just have a certain chemistry in working together. And the Hathaway character is not just there so Lewis can play off of someone. You can tell that Hathaway respects Lewis (a great change from the Pilot), but is quick to interject his opinion or viewpoint. I purchased the box set of the Pilot and Series 1 & 2 and I am trying to find Series 3 and Series 4 on Region 1 DVD format but have not been successful. But I can assure you that I will keep trying.",1277769600,6,794,4.559440559440559
3984475,3,B002TCRQ5Y,"I absolutely love this show!  I am one of perhaps a dozen people on the planet who enjoyed watching 'Inspector Morse' more for the character of Sergeant Lewis than for Morse.  I am angered, however, by the shameful way 'Lewis' is treated by PBS.

Have you ever watched an episode and wondered 'How did Hathaway know about that film deal?' or 'Why are they suspecting so-and-so all of a sudden?'; not to mention some incongruous, apparently midday, wardrobe changes?  I'll tell you why this happens:  these DVDs do NOT have the complete version of the episodes; PBS has done a hatchet job on them.  They cut even more scenes from the versions they air on Masterpiece Mystery.

The only complete versions are those on the ITV DVDs which you'll need a region-free DVD player to watch.  On the bright side, you can get the ITV versions of the pilot and series 1 through 3 (12 episodes) and a Behind-the-Scenes bonus disc for about the same price as incomplete versions of the pilot and series 1 and 2 (11 episodes - what PBS calls series 1-2 includes all the series 1 and 2 episodes and three series 3 episodes; excluding only the episode 'Counter Culture Blues' from series 3.  Don't ask me why.).  Oh, and the British DVDs have subtitles, too.

Now so glad I did.  Having a quality DVD transfer allows one to view the picture in the complete-screen, zoom mode and some of the photography of Oxford and the vacinity is truly lovely.  The series itself is remarkably well done.  As a staunch Morse fan, I was terribly pleased.  If you are like me and do not want to spend the high amount for the full Morse Set, this is a very nice consolation until, hopefully, a more afordable Morse set is released.  Another reviewer, I believe, has commented on the dialogue being a bit difficult to understand.  I did not find it so, but then I have excellent hearing and am somewhat accustomed to british speech.

Kevin Whately is also better than ever. Fortunately, we saw the second series on PBS, or we may not have ordered Inspector Lewis until much later. Lawrence Fox is brilliant and we were familiar with his work in other movies (e.g., Becoming Jane). Congratulations to the director and producers for providing a first-rate product.

They've enjoyed having all of these new episodes to work through, but consistently have been running into issues with being able to understand what the main characters are saying.  I've watched a few and have to agree--the mix is very poorly done.  The seemingly ever-present musical score is constantly drowning out the dialog, and it's been tried now on several speaker setups so it's not just a problem with a particular entertainment center setup.  Couple this with the occasional British slang and the habitual dropping consonants, and watching becomes very difficult at times.

Furthermore, though closed captioning is listed as a feature, there doesn't seem to be any way to actually turn it on--again attempted on a couple of players (one DVD and one Blu Ray) and different TVs.  The TV says that CC is on, but no text ever appears.  It's a shame as the characters are very likable and well played, and the writing is above average for the type of show it is.  I do recommend it, I just wish a less amateurish sound mix had been achieved.",1267401600,46,1176,4.702439024390244

8380104,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"I have really been enjoying this series. Recently discovered them in final season and wanted to go back and start from the beginning. I couldn't be happier with this excellent seller- fast shipping and the DVD set is in excellent condition- like new. I hope to purchase the rest of the seasons from this same seller. If you like British mysteries, this is one of the best, and you can never figure out who the murderer is! Set in town/ university of Oxford, which was enjoyable.",1374796800,,478,4.569767441860465

8380106,5,B002TCRQ5Y,"I agree with the other 5-star reviews regarding the sophistication of this series, and its favourable comparison with the old Morse series.  The characters are well acted, the script is well thought-out and written, and the direction is superb.  The Oxford scenery is nice too; it reminds my wife of her home not too very far from there.",1362614400,,337,4.793103448275862
