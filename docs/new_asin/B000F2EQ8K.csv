8116538,5,B000F2EQ8K,"This DVD is definitely about Agility... not other dog sports. But agilty is my sport.

I have been doing agility for several years... but in a venue where distance work was not essential.  This last year I started competing in NADAC and quickly learned that I really needed to add distance work to our skill set.  The question was: ""How do I train my dog for distance?""

The DVD was GREAT at walking you through the steps to getting your dog to work at a distance for the various ""moves"" you need on an agility course. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to work their dog in agility, at a distance.",1349395200,,605,4.327433628318584
8116539,2,B000F2EQ8K,"Overall the DVD gave some good training ideas but it was very short. It could have been expanded maybe how to make the gates they used for the training, or how to extend the distance as this is what the DVD was about ""Control at a Distance"". I got this as a gift but I'm not sure it was worth the $35",1263168000,,300,3.8548387096774195
8116540,5,B000F2EQ8K,excellent video - recommend it for dog owners who want to do agility the best way for their dogs.,1206144000,,97,4.157894736842105
8116541,3,B000F2EQ8K,It was ok a bit basic you can tell there was a small budget not what I thought it was going to be. I was thinking standing in the middle of the field directing your dog from afar which it didn't provide for me. However it does have some good points about training,1194220800,4,263,3.981132075471698
