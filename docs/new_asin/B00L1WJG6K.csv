6461064,4,B00L1WJG6K,"""We are all, all of us, including me somebody else's table scraps."" Tennessee State University is having a problem with their sports programs. In order to save money they decide to drop the baseball team and add two smaller programs. One of the new programs they add is a men's golf team. The biggest problem they have is that no one wants to coach. The AD recruits swim team coach Catana Starks (Henson) since she has experience playing. She is very excited at the opportunity but when she is told she will receive no scholarships, funding or any help at all she decides to make her own rules. I love sports movies and especially the true ones like this. Like many sports movies this one focuses on the personal stories rather then the sport itself. That's what makes them so great. Unlike other sports movies though this one has a huge focus on the coach's life rather then how she helps the team come together. There are a few cheesy parts in this but for the most part the movie is very inspiring. There really isn't a big motivational speech like many sports movies have but what it does have are little lines that have the same power and inspiration as the long speeches usually given. The characters are great and are really likable. I really did enjoy this and I recommend this but it is not at the same level as Remember The Titans or movies like that. Overall, a very good and inspiring true story that I recommend. Even though there are a few cheesy parts it never comes off as being overly cheesy and laughable. I give this a B+.",1409443200,11,1541,4.448763250883392

It's too bad the producers included this because the story line is wonderful.  I really enjoy movies based on a true story, but at least 5 uses of foul language, including the Lord's name in vain.

6461102,5,B00L1WJG6K,I love this film never knew there was a Black female coach for Golf. And how she taught those least likely to be the best. When we count ourselves out others see the best in us and help bring it out.

6461129,1,B00L1WJG6K,"If you take golf seriously even in the slightest, this movie becomes a comedy. Everything is so unrealistic it'll make you laugh. I'm a former asst. college golf coach and I was almost crying laughing at how bad the movie was. It was easily one of the corniest videos I have ever seen.

The list of ridiculous things I saw included:

1. Five kids pretending to be college golfers who couldn't break 120 if they played in real life.
2. A player changing his aim on the first tee about 90 degrees until he was aimed at an entirely different hole.
3. Players teeing off with wooden drivers on a medium length par 3 hole and celebrating when they hit the fairway about half way to the hole.
4. The worst putting stroke in history from the black player.
5. The players on the team supposedly didn't own even a single golf club and most of them had never played a tournament of any kind! Instead they had to play with clubs from a shed in the projects that their coach somehow knew about that had exactly 1 bag of clubs for each player on the team.
6. Only starters were on the team. The team only had 5 players when pretty much every team has between 10-12.

There are so many more, but I think you get the point. The movie is utterly ridiculous, but you may still want to watch it. It brought me to tears laughing. It truly is a comedy for those who understand the game of golf.",1450051200,,1374,4.236641221374046

I was not thinking of him as Malfoy through the whole movie. It's not a big action-hero tent-pole film, so it satisfies a more cerebral and emotional audience, but I really liked it, cuz that's right up my alley.

We need more positive movies like this, but I don't think it gave Ms. Starks justice. I found this movie to be like a low budget, after school special. The acting wasn't bad and I love Taraji P. Henson, but this movie wasn't put together well and the writing wasn't good at all. My main issue was how one-dimensional all the guys were. It was like all was important was their race or heritage and we didn't get to see anything beyond that in these characters. Every character was one-dimensional and cliche. Every, single one of them. It was a big disappointment. This movie lacked emotion and heart that I'd expect from a biography. It wasn't touching at all and I didn't get a glimpse of who Starks really was as a person. I was shocked at how disappointing this was.

You might like it. Who knows? But if you want to see inspirational sports stories with good writing and in-depth characters, one of my favorites is Radio with Cuba Gooding Jr.. It has all the heart and emotion that this movie does not.",1476576000,,1157,4.406542056074766
