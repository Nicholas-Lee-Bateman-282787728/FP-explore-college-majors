1904401,5,B0000A7W19,Received in great condition. I was having a tough time finding thus movie and you had it. Thanks so much for your honesty and getting this product to me.,1326672000,,153,4.310344827586207
1904402,3,B0000A7W19,"There are almost as many conspiracy theories about this film as about JFK himself: locations were barred, actors dropped out and it was strongly implied that Oliver Stone and his powerful agent Michael Ovitz put unreasonable pressure on the picture to 'protect' the Kevin Costner film. On its cinema release, the film disappeared quicker than a witness in the Warren Commission - in the UK it barely lasted a week. Yet though it may lack the star power and sweep of Stone's epic, it is still a worthwhile and intriguing film.

Unlike most JFK movies, Ruby doesn't bombard you with information or alternatives, but gives a plausible account of events seen through one man's eyes - in this case Jack Ruby, the small-time burlesque club owner and former hit-man who shot Lee Harvey Oswald. Less visually striking (but then overt stylistics were never John MacKenzie's strongpoint) and on a smaller scale as befits its character, to its credit it is more of a character piece than a conspiracy movie, with Aiello's central performance turning what could have been a minor film into a more interesting one.

There are a couple of marvellous moments - Ruby seeking professional advice on how to hit the president of a country (Castro, not Kennedy) and set up a patsy as they pass Deeley Plaza, and the minutes leading up to the assassination when both Ruby and the stripper he has a curiously chaste relationship with suddenly realise what is happening - and a lot of very strong ones. Extremely well-crafted and building to a climax rather than constantly grabbing your attention, it has the feel of the sixties, both in the production design and the very approach of the film. A more controlled, centred film than its dazzling big-budget rival, Ruby may not be a masterpiece but it does deserve to be better known.",1292630400,,1810,4.835483870967742
1904403,5,B0000A7W19,in this film you must watch out for David Duchovny  other than that it starts out a bit slow and then picks up .,1281744000,,112,3.6666666666666665
1904404,5,B0000A7W19,"First of all let me say I loved this film.  Of course as a student of the JFK assassination, I immediately recognized the film takes generous amounts of artistic license.  However I still find it interesting and compelling.

Almost everyone knows the story of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald on live television.  This film explores Ruby's adult life in Dallas as owner of a perpetually struggling burlesque club.  The post-murder of Oswald is not explored as in-depth.

I liked how the film went into Ruby's involvement with amoral Dallas policemen and his quasi-cooperation with the FBI and CIA.  And Ruby's relationship with dancer ""Candy Cane"" was presented as tender, sweet, and was very well done.

A few problems I have with the film:  Danny Aiello's portrayal of  Jack Ruby was almost too kind.  Aiello played him as a sympathetic character, who was (somewhat) forced into unscrupulous dealings with Dallas police, just to keep his club afloat.

It's true that Jack Ruby was involved in those kinds of shady and illegal activities, but in real life Jack Ruby was a shrill, excitable individual.  He was a fight waiting to happen, and he savagely beat up countless customers.  In fits of rage, he personally threw men down flights of stairs.  It's well known that he sent countless customers to the hospital for lengthy stays.

In real life Jack Ruby spoke in an odd voice, somewhat nasal and lispy.  In photographs with his dancers at the time, Jack Ruby looks like a 100% effeminate gay man.  He NEVER made a move on any of his dancers, never married, and had a ""girlfriend"" that was all for show.

Danny Ailello portrayed Ruby as masculine, dignified, pleasant, just a struggling businessman who got mixed up in the wrong crowd......which we all know wasn't the case.  He was a ruffian, with a fowl temper and he was highly unscrupulous.

The character of David Ferry was portrayed by Tobin Bell, also (in my humble opinion) as excessively positive.  Tobin played Ferry as an eccentric and enigmatic CIA agent.  In real life David Ferry was a mess.  He made his own wigs (that looked like a dog with mange), and he painted on his eyebrows with a black magic marker.

However, perhaps the film would have been too annoying to sit through, had the two men been portrayed as they were in real life-lol  Can a movie goer sit through 90 minutes of lisping, bizarre murderers?  I don't know.

However I still recommend the film.  Just realize the producers took a large chunk of artistic license, and you should enjoy it as much as I did.  I give it 5 stars because I believe the characters' real personalities were artistically and successfully manipulated to make an entertaining film.",1279929600,,2695,4.783080260303688
1904405,3,B0000A7W19,"""Ruby"" is John Mackenzie's answer to Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". Stone dealt with the Jim Garrison case while Mackenzie deals with Jack Ruby and his cohorts.

The movie has decent production values. I was expecting a low budget film. The movie even starts out with a film noir feel. You hear saxophone playing on a dimly lit street. A man is hanging from a hook from a gangland hit. This gives the movie a needed boost in the opening.

Danny Aiello plays that enigmatic assassin Jack Ruby. He's a simple night club owner. He has the several business arrangments with the Dallas Police Department. He's an informant for the FBI. He has ties to Cuban gun runners. If only the real Ruby would stand up...

Ruby meets ""Candy Cane"" played by Sherilyn Fenn. ""Candy Cane"" is a composite based in part on ""Candy Barr"", a notorious exotic dancer and adult performer. Candy Cane shows Ruby's softer side.

The movie shows the title character going to Cuba and getting mixed up with anti-Castro mobsters. An enigmatic figure named ""Maxwell"" (probably a composite of Maurice Bishop aka David Atlee Phillips) is on the fringes, keeping to the shadows. He seems to know everything about Ruby's business.

The movie gives some interesting meat to chew on. Who was Jack Ruby? What were his motivations? But in the final analysis, these questions go largely unanswered. The creators didn't want to stick their necks out like Oliver Stone did with his magna opus. And this is a fatal flaw.

If more time was spent developing the motivations of Jack Ruby or exploring his ties to organized crime or his ties to the CIA, the movie would garner an extra star from me. If the movie had done all these things, it would have garnered an extra star and a half. This movie is a bit of a let down because it is so close being great.",1255737600,,1799,4.60625
1904406,3,B0000A7W19,"Indeed, an intriguing film, with some unexpected ""touching"" performances... to fit with the violence.  Bordering on the edge of purely

""possible conjecture and outright fantasy,"" it still makes for an engaging, interesting tale... based on skewered facts, and under-the-cover gossip.  JFK (Oliver Stone) did it best.  But this is not too far behind in the same race on a mythical track.  It was an enjoyable surprise, nonetheless.",1171152000,,431,5.373134328358209

1904408,2,B0000A7W19,"since one-half of my lineage is undoubtedly related to Jack, I am curious about all things Rubenstein, and this just came on The Box so I'm cking it out...but I have a beef...why does Hollywood persist in casting non-Jewish actors as Jewish characters, esp. Danny Aiello (in this and at least one other, which title I dis-remember, it's about Jewish widows in Pittsburgh(?)) are there NO jewish actors available to do this schlock and who can bring to the role, at the very least, an authentic rendering of ""schmuck"" and ""schlmiel""? Aw schucks, this whole thing schux! Aiello is just not believable when he says ""I'm Jewish""!

1904409,4,B0000A7W19,"There are spoilers in this review, but you should already know the historical details anyway.
""Ruby"" isn't a good movie, but it *almost* was, and long stretches of the movie show us glimpses of the great movie it could have been. These portions of the movie are good enough to be worth owning the DVD for (especially if you enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" for the look and feel of it rather than factual analysis).
The story takes what little is known about Ruby's shady life - that he was a burlesque club owner who had connections to organized crime and the CIA - and riffs on this entertainingly. However, the idea that Ruby's motive for shooting Oswald was ""to expose the whole thing"" makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, especially knowing that he made no great revelations about the conspiracy after he thrust himself into the public eye. How do you expose a conspiracy by silencing a key conspirator?
For some reason, the director chose to portray the mobster Santos Trafficante under the transparent guise of a character named Alicante. The fictional character of Candy Cane is rather pointless, especially since she seems to be a total fabrication and not based on any of Ruby's actual strippers. The infamous Jada is nowhere to be seen in the film, which is one of the biggest disappointments for me.
The look and feel of the film is great, though. It's an enjoyable immersion in gangsters, burlesque, spies, and politics, in late-50s-early-60s surroundings. Their period portrayal of Cuba is extremely well done, but rather than recreate Las Vegas, they simply pillaged stock footage from Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"". This perfectly illustrates the film's uneven level of quality.",1060732800,,1694,4.96830985915493
1904410,4,B0000A7W19,"In ""Ruby"", veteran actor Danny Aiello does a superb job of portraying the man who will forever be remembered for silencing the accused assassin of President Kennedy.
  Aiello almost makes a better Jack Ruby than Jack Ruby himself.
Aiello gives a memorable performance and gives valuable insight as to why Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. Hint: It wasn't why the Warren Commission said he did. There were much more conspiratorial and sinister reasons.
  This movie will certainly add to the intrigue of the JFK Assassination conspiracy.
It paints Ruby as somewhat of a patsy himself, like Lee Oswald was.
  Sherilyn Fenn does a great job as ""Candy Cane"" one of Ruby's strippers.
  You really feel for Ruby and Cane at the end of this movie.
 This movie also has a very stunning scene of the JFK Assassination, and it was filmed in Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was killed.
If you are interested in the JFK assassination, the Mafia's vendetta against Castro, or the corruption of the Dallas Police at the time of the JFK murder, you will find this movie very interesting.
  I hope you enjoy it.",1056931200,,1091,4.75
1904411,5,B0000A7W19,"this is a good movie for anybody interested in the JFK assassination or for just anybody who wants to watch a good movie.
this movie has very little to do with the actual facts, for instance, the girl, Candy Cane dosen't exist, but they put her in anyway.
the actual assassination is pretty good.
only 2 shooters though, but not a bad re-enactment.
Robert Groden also got involved in this movie, Groden is the author of several books and helped recreate the Dealey Plaza scene for JFK.
the saddest part of the movie is the assassination of JFK.
you see the motorcade come down Elm Street in front of the book depository and in the background you hear Amazing Grace.
kinda sad.
i like the theme song when he's going to kill Oswald, but the actual Oswald assassination scence is pretty corny. in the movie, Oswald sees Ruby coming at him and he prepares for the shot, in reality, that never happened, but this isn't a documentry, it's a movie.
so enjoy it.",1024531200,,954,4.520231213872832
1904412,4,B0000A7W19,"Aiello gives a superb performance (in a fictionalized speculation) as Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner who is willing to exploit the mob but at the same  time be connected to it, and later murders President JFK's assassin.

7996413,3,B0000A7W19,"The premise--a dramatization of Jack Ruby's role in the Kennedy Assassination--seems promising, but film would have been better served by hewing closer to the facts:  the Sherilyn Fenn character is entirely fictional.  And the plot is murky, despite hints at dark dealings at every turn.  It is intriguing to see David Duchovny and Arliss Howard here in an early roles.",1525478400,,369,5.116666666666666

7996415,5,B0000A7W19,"As Trevor Willsmer said, ""The film may not be a masterpiece but it deserves to be better known."" Willsmer gave it only Three Stars but I'm going a bit higher. I'm the ninth person to give this film Five Stars (Four And A Half) and the 20th overall to review it on Amazon. This film got lost in the shuffle due to the more ubiquitous JFK but it still provides another facet to that tumultuous time in American history more than 50 years ago.

This film is not a broad conspiracy movie so much as it is a character study of Jack Ruby. I liked that portrayal. Danny Aiello was incredible in this film. I really liked his portrayal of Jack Ruby. Mr. Aiello was alive at the time of Kennedy's assassination so that allowed him to give a special flavor to the role. He may well have seen Ruby slay Oswald on TV that night in 1963.

And lest I forget about Sherilyn Fenn! Wow! She's absolutely super gorgeous. No man could resist her.

For what it is this film is a great production and it captured the ambiance of the 1960s very well. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

7996422,5,B0000A7W19,"John Mackenzie directed one of the most ambitious gangster films of British Cinema mafia flicks, The Long Good Friday starring Bob Hoskins. Now he's back again with his american True Events based mafia flick about Jack Ruby, JFK & Santos Trafficante. In this flim Ruby is played by Danny Aiello in an Oscar worthy performance. This film made me a fan of Aiello. This is better then The Last Don, Marc Lawrence plays Santos (Allicante) Trafficante in this film. He also plays Carlo Gambino in Gotti. He gets allot more screen time in this film and is absolutely menacing. Joe Cortese (Family Enforcer, Monsignor, Rat Pack) co-stars in this great mafia flick. His part is reasonable. John Mackenzie shows once again what made him such a great underrated film. This is a good companion piece to JFK or Rat Pack. The back drop is of course the JFK assassination. John Scott also plays an Oscar worthy Score reminiscent but all in all better then the Godfathers which ads to the greatness of this mafia flick. Truly an underrated film Danny Aiello also stars in another great Mafia meets Dukes Of Hazard flick Hooch. This one's more commonly available. Hooch is grindhouse style like Family Enforcer, this film is a mini epic like Rat Pack & Lansky. The only thing missing is Joe Pesci's Oscar Worthy performance briefly scene in JFK which would've made this complete. Instead we get the Saw Creep. All In all very great film and very underrated. Fans of great Gangster flicks must pick this up soon.",1327190400,,1495,4.753846153846154
