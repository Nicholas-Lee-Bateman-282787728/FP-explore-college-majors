2164706,5,B00063UEFM,"The Faerie Tale Theatre movies are classic retellings of fairy tales featuring A-list 80's stars (mostly c or d list stars today). These movies were among my favorites when I was a small child, now that I am a little older I watch them and pick up on jokes or other details that went way over my head back then. I can't say enough good things about Faerie Tale Theatre!",1098403200,8,369,4.285714285714286

2164708,5,B00063UEFM,"After years of waiting, Faerie Tale Theatre fans can finally own the series on DVD. Shelley Duvall's series originally appeared on Showtime 20 years ago and featured well-known and rising stars of the time. The series' enthusiastic interpretations of beloved fairy tales has made it a cult classic. Better yet, the DVD prices are affordable, especially after the high prices the used VHS copies have been earning in recent years.

The collection package featured here contains all of the 26 fairy tales created for the series.  The original series had an extra special, called Grimm Party, that was a retrospective of the series with various casts and Shelley Duvall.  Unfortunately, this episode has never been made available on VHS, laser disc, or DVD, not being included in licensing packages.  While this might be a disappointing omission, it shouldn't lessen the thrill of finally having DVD editions of the 26 tales themselves at a great price.

Here's a list of all 26 episodes contained in this collection:

The Tale of the Frog Prince

Rumpelstilskin

Rapunzel

The Nightingale

Sleeping Beauty

Jack and the Beanstalk

Little Red Riding Hood

Hansel and Gretel

Goldilocks and the Three Bears

The Princess and the Pea

Pinocchio

Thumbelina

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

Beauty and the Beast

The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers

The Three Little Pigs

The Snow Queen

The Pied Piper of Hamelin

Cinderella

Puss 'n Boots

The Emperor's New Clothes

Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp

The Princess Who Had Never Laughed

Rip Van Winkle

The Little Mermaid

The Dancing Princesses",1096243200,540,1607,5.019083969465649

You may select a specific episode from the main menu. Full screen format. So star studded the cast of characters reads like a who's who of Hollywood. A collector's storybook was included with my copy. The storybook has a partial listing of cast and crew and some wonderful photos of the stars. Beautiful. Carrie Fisher played the part of Thumbelina, for instance. All in all, I have no regrets with this purchase.",1484352000,6,573,4.74

They aren't vulgar, so I can feel comfortable letting my kids watch them.  Best of all, you get to see some of Shelley Duvall's fellow actor/actress friends take part in most of these plays, when they were WAY younger (I think these were done back in the 1970s).  For example, I saw Liza Minnelli in the last play we watched. Ellen Barkin played the young princess in another one.  FABULOUS!!!  Worth the $$.",1438041600,,558,4.770833333333333

2164848,5,B00063UEFM,"This collection has a WONDERFUL extra. (You should always check the SPECIAL FEATURES on every disk.

While getting ready to attend a cast-party celebrating all of the Faerie Tale Theatre that were produced, Shelley Duvall falls, hits her head, and finds herself transported back in time to meet the Brothers Grimm.

Unfortunately, the brothers are not happy with the liberties that they think she has taken with their tales, so she uses magic to show them that she actually did a very good job, showing them favorite clips from many episodes. The brothers have complaints, which she does her best to answer, and in the end, acquits herself nicely.

This EXTRA feature is worth getting the entire package in order to enjoy.

I remember watching Faerie Tale Theatre in the 80's, when I was in my 30s. I loved it then, and I love it now, rewatching it many years later. All of them are well done. It's fun seeing my favorite actors in roles I had forgotten they had appeared in. I love the edginess. I love the fact that the ending was not always happy. The Little Mermaid did not get her guy, for example.

I believe that Shelley did a better job than Disney at staying more faithful to the original stories, a point that she makes when she finds herself before the court, defending her interpretation of the stories, being challenged by the ""Judges Grimm.""

The LOST episode is on the seventh disk. You can watch it first, as an introduction to the 26 wonderful Faerie Tales, or you can watch it last. Either way, you will love the LOST TALE, and you will love all the GRIMM tales.

I highly recommend this title, whether you buy it, rent it, or borrow it from the public library (which is what I did).

I am lucky enough to be a member of the Clarendon County Public Library, which is part of the SCLENDS system, 19 counties in the state that allow interlibrary loans of materials, for no extra charge. If you are lucky enough to be part of a similar system in your state, then I urge you to go to the library website where you'll be able to search for books, DVD's and more, all borrowable by request.",1410998400,,2102,4.484293193717278

Finally passed it on to my sister for her grand kids ... but now it's stuck while she watches them.  The productions themselves are not the pretty, sanitized versions that everyone has come to expect and the stories seem to linger on as every element is brought into play during the completion of each hour-long (less commercial break) episode.  That said, it assumes to present the fables in their original entirety which is something that hardly ever happens nowadays.

2164904,3,B00063UEFM,"Purchased this DVD set expecting to see a television (or movie) quality series, not 26 stage plays with cheap props and mediocre backdrops.  Sure, Ms. Duvall enlisted the acting services of some top-notch actors and actresses, and the fairy tales are told as faithfully to the source as is possible, but the episodes still felt cheap to both my wife and I.  I imagine this would be fine for a child, but for an adult who is still a child at heart we found this series to be somewhat lacking in production values.  Not only that, this re-issued series does NOT contain the ""3-in-1 Faerie Tale Theater Game (Custom playing cards, memory match and trivia)"".  They cheaped out on this collection by re-issuing it without including everything as reported in the pics (back of the box).

2164914,5,B00063UEFM,"This is something everyone really should get. I wasn't even born when this show came on. I only know about it from a VHS tape we had. But after looking up the show, I knew I wanted to get it, and I didn't regret it. This show was, and still is amazing. The list of stars in this is mind blowing.

It has been said that Shelly had a deep love of fairy tales, and let me tell you, when you look at the writing for these episodes, you can practically feel the love and care that went into them. Some episodes take pokes at the story structure, like Sleeping Beauty, but they are very affectionate pokes. And many of these adaptations play with the weak points of the basic story and make it better. Yeah, some episodes do have weak points of their own, but none of them are bad, not in the least. Even for someone in their early 20s like me that never truly saw much of the original show, who wasn't born until 1990, I really loved watching every episode.

And the box is just beautiful, and so is the story book they included. True, the set doesn't have much of anything by way of special features, but considering it's Faerie Tale Theatre, I don't really see that as a problem. So to anyone reading this, I seriously recommend this item. Buy it for your kids or yourself. You'll all enjoy it. That's a guarantee, even now.",1374969600,,1321,4.258964143426295

2164917,1,B00063UEFM,I was very disappointed.  The Frog Prince was very sexually suggestive.  Even the way the frog placed his hand was inappropriate for children or anyone.  The three bears was very silly and did not convey the essence of the fairytale. i ordered these to share with grandkids when they visited.  I would not show them to anyone.,1372723200,9,326,4.666666666666667
2164918,5,B00063UEFM,"I grew up watching some of the Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre on PBS.  But have never seen all of the episodes growing up.  So this was a wonderful collection to have.  I enjoyed watching this.  And so does the kids.

The film quality is not HD or anything.  More of what I remembered it was like living in the 90s.
This series was made in the early 80s.  Keep that in mind.

The costumes is not the best.  More high school quality productions.  But if you read the history of this series, they were on a shoe strings budget.

One of my favorite episode is the ""frog prince"" played by Robin Williams.  I LOVED it.  Robin Williams was the frog prince and he was SO hilarious!!!

So overall, quality is not the best.  Not bad either.  Just mediocre.  Costumes not too fancy by today's standards.  But the plot was very well written and that is rare today.  Most of what you see on TV today is bling and flashy costumes, but the story line sucks or it has too much adult humors.  I am more conservative.  So this series is great in content.

Highly recommended.  I love it.  and so does the kids and the family.  Brings back so much childhood memories for me.",1371945600,,1162,4.293023255813954

Some of the stories were stretched a bit to fit with the time given for each episode. It made the shortest tales even more entertaining. ""The Pied Piper"" with Eric Idle as the piper was perfectly done. It is a sad poem that does not end well. There was nothing done to lighten the tale, which would ruin the message of the story.

I would give this 5 stars in a heartbeat, however, I sadly cannot because of one detail: It is NOT closed captioned or subtitled!!

I'm deaf, so this is an extreme disappointment to me. I rely on captions to be able to follow along to a TV or movie. Back in the 80s when it was VHS format, they were captioned.  But I haven't been able to find a CC'ed DVD version anywhere.  I haven't had a VHS player in years, and would very much love to be able to buy this Faerie Tale Theatre box set to enjoy.  I cannot understand why this is not captioned, especially since it's a law that all things must be captioned. Do you know if there's a CCed version anywhere? Or if Entertainment One has any plans to release a captioned/subtitled version in the near future???

Shelley Duvall, and Entertainment One, if you are reading this, PLEASE re-release this with captions!!!!! Pretty please! :)

After getting them, I'd have to say I feel little mixed on them.  There are a bunch of different stories in here and I'd say you have a 50/50 chance of watching a good one.  Some of them bring me back to my childhood and are still fun for me and my children, while others are just so low in production quality or scripted so poorly it's painful (you would think that Robin Williams as a toad would be funny, but trust me it's not).  The question you have to ask yourself before buying these is whether it's worth paying this price for the half in this set that are good (because it certainly isn't worth the price for the other half).  So if you have the patience to filter the garbage from the gold, then I'd say they are worth a shot.",1359763200,8,852,4.13939393939394

2164951,3,B00063UEFM,"Loved the nostalgia of my childhood. Sleeping Beauty and Little Red Riding Hood are definitely a little more risque, but as a child I never noticed. The things that bother me are the crappy quality of the images and sound. Nothing was done to remaster the film, and with time it's degraded so that the images on dvd are worse than the original images I saw on tv in the 80's. The sound is all over the place and there are no subtitles so I can't always understand what is being said. Finally, they removed some scenes. In Rumpelstiltskin, there's a scene introducing the maiden where she is singing, ""Make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the other gold."" It gives the audience a background for her relationship with the forest animals. Yet for some reason it was edited out in this edition.

I'm glad to have the dvd for nostalgia purposes, but I'm disappointed the creators of this set didn't do more justice to the series.",1357689600,2,940,4.497076023391813

I just love that they spell ""Faerie Tale"" and ""Theatre"" the original way, as they did in the old world. It just speaks to their diligence with detail on the entire series. A lot of hard work went into these theatrical performances. The stories are portrayed by famous performers, in a way that works well on film. It is theatrical, but not filmed on stage in a theatre. It is seriously such a gem of an item! True, true entertainment on all levels! Just watching these will make you a little more cultured; and you will laugh and cry right along with them. The sets, costumes, make-up and performances are all top-notch displays is true skilled artistry. Beautiful.

Amazon, you really need to update this listing if it's not going to include what is advertised.  I am terribly disappointed that this listing is misleading and even more disappointed that these sets won't be as great a gift as I had hoped them to be.  You've really let me down!!",1354147200,5,606,4.366071428571429

However, my husband didn't grow up with these movies and thinks they aren't all that great. He can just go watch Duck Tales in the next room:)",1354060800,,338,4.136363636363637

You see, there are so few avenues of ""escape"" for all of us to take and the ""Faery Tale Theatre"" opens the door to memory, happiness, and an unreality that becomes Real as we take in all the impossibilities of the lands we can never reach.  I recomm,end this not just for your youngsters but for yourselves.  It's a great journey into a space we have never really been to.",1353974400,,582,4.216216216216216

However, both the product-description and a sticker on the plastic-wrap surrounding the set mention a 3-in-one card-game that is conspicuously absent from the package. I'm not sure if that was a shipping oversight, or if Amazon's batch indeed does not include the mentioned cards. The cards can be seen as part of the advertisement on the set's website, [...] (click ""DVD Info"" and mouse-over and click ""Click to see playing cards!"" on the product-description that appears).
The episodes are fun, but appear somewhat grainy when viewed on a PC at 1080p with default codecs. This isn't a problem for me, as I'll happily watch them at a lower resolution.
Lastly, one of the reviewers said that this set doesn't have the ""Grimm Party"" Reunion episode, which is in fact included in the special features of this set.",1353196800,,1008,5.115151515151515
2164970,2,B00063UEFM,"I received the Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection but was sadly disappointed. It was nice to see many famous actors before they attained greatness but it at the same time, viewing the various faerie stories was not as I remembered. It just proves the point that past experiences of one's youth tend to take on a patina of nostalgia that does not relate to the original experience. ""You can't go home again"" is definitely true.",1350864000,4,436,4.75

2164974,1,B00063UEFM,"Wow, I thought this would be charming, sweet, and a wonderful introduction to stage acting versus the cartoon versions of these fairy tales out there.  I was sorely disappointed.  We had to turn off ""Frog Prince"" when the humanized ""frog"" appeared naked in the princess' bed, and asked seductively for another kiss. Really?  Good greif--do my children REALLY need to see that?  And she called him a ""horny toad"".  Really!  I find this production overtly sexual which is completely unnecessary for adults to be able to tolerate watching them, too.  We enjoy watching heart warming tales such as Winnie the Pooh and thought these productions would have a lot more heart.  Perhaps when my kids are older we can watch them together, but skip Frog Prince (which is the first show on the first CD) if you have young kids.  I've now read the other negative reviews and see that Sleeping Beauty is also overtly sexual (Christopher Reeve bites off a sequin from Beauty's bodice), so skip that one, too.",1347926400,25,993,4.794117647058823

Like Teri Garr, Christopher Lee, Robin Williams, Lee Remick, Vincent Price, Paul Reubens, Mick Jagger, Helen Mirren, Liza Minelli, etc.  This is totally fun for the entire family and most of us who happen to love fairy tales and looooooooooooooooove the 80's.

A few of the shows did not run, when you play them it plays a different show.  I've checked all the dvds and on my copy cinderella and another did not run, and instead plays snow white when I try to play it; on my previous copy I owned pinocchio did not run.",1328918400,,471,4.043010752688172

If you remember the show from when you were younger then you know just what I am talking about. If you have never seen it before it is all the wonderful faerie tales told in a live person method. Anything from Rumplestiltskin to Cinderella. Each episode is about an hour long though so you might have to wait until the kids can sit through it. But my daughter is 8 and step is 5 and they watched about 4 in a row and wanted more. Certainly kept them entertained. I don't promote tons of tv watching for the kids but once in awhile is ok and if your looking for something magical then this is it.,1324512000,2,720,4.041958041958042

The set includes classic fairy tales, some very familiar (""Cinderella"", ""Snow White"") and some not so well-known (""The Nightingale"", ""The Princess Who Had Never Laughed"").  For adults it is fun seeing familiar actors playing various roles (Robin Williams as a frog in ""The Frog Prince"", Shelley Duvall as Rupunzel, Mick Jagger as the Emperor in ""The Nightingale"", etc).

There are some adult themes in The Frog Prince that I didn't care for. I also didn't like hearing the word d@mn in it. I would also say that Sleeping Beauty has some offensive themes as well. My childrens favorites vary. My oldest likes The Boy Who Left Home To Find Out About The Shivers, and The Princess And The Pea. My youngest likes The Dancing Princesses, and my favorites are Cinderella and Snow White. The stories are cute, and most add humor. Some are more for adults while there are still several younger children will enjoy.

The quality of the picture is not that great, and there are no subtitles.

This collection is beautiful.  The dvd's are so pretty and nicely organized that I almost do not want to touch them.  The collection contains many more tales that I have never seen.

I soon searched Amazon and found the complete box set.  We love it!  While some episodes are better than others, they are each laughable and enjoyable.  Who can resist the (completely unrealistic) simplicity of the stories, low-budget scenery and special guest actors?  Faerie Tale Theatre can be enjoyed by young and old (especially if you enjoyed it when you were young).  We watch it to relive our childhood days and have even got new friends hooked on it!

As for the shows themselves--they are witty versions of fairy tales, with simple, low-budget sets and costumes. Kind of like a school play, but with  good acting. Some of the humor is off-color. It went over my girls' heads when they were small. Some episodes are better than others. We love Princess and the Pea, Princess Who Never Laughed, and the Dancing Princesses.

I asked my mother about the tapes and she said that she had given them away. I thought that I would never get to see them again. I decided to check Amazon and found that they all of the shows in one DVD set! I immediately ordered it. They are exactly what I remember and am so happy that I could find them.

They love them as much as their folks did. They especially love Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. My four year old grandaughter Cyriana told me that Beauty and the Beast was scarry at first but she liked the way the story ended.

2165027,5,B00063UEFM,"Faerie Tale Theatre played on cable in the 80's and I could hardly wait until the next episode. These twenty-six versions of traditional folklore are anything but what you would expect. Every show is full of stars whose names you know well...oh a certain age. You won't see Disney Channel stars, and actually there are a hand full of much loved stars that we have lost. There are movie stars, Broadway greats, and TV favorites too. I love Art Carney in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Ben Vereen as ""Puss in Boots"" was amazing! Jeff Goldblum as the wolf in ""The Three Little Pigs"" has me rolling. These shows bring old fashioned stories into a more modern context and set them on their ear delightfully. You won't find explosions or profanity, and yet my teenagers still put down their phones and MP3 players and watched completely absorbed. Fun for all ages, but some adults may be distracted by a rollicking round of ""Oh wait! I know that actor. What is his name?""",1292371200,,963,4.637426900584796
2165028,4,B00063UEFM,"I loved this series when I was a kid and bought it on DVD to share with my (then) 8yo daughter. I was afraid, growing up as she has not knowing a world without digital effects, that it might be too cheesy for her.

Happily, I was wrong!  We spent most of her Christmas break enjoying these treasures from the 80s.  As many other parents have said, the dialogue is full of double entendres and subtle meanings of an adult nature. For me, however, that gave it an added dimension that allowed me to enjoy watching them all over again with an adult's eyes.  I was a little older than my daughter is now (10-12) when I watched the series on cable and ~none~ of the adult gags blipped my radar in those days. My daughter didn't catch them, either, which makes me think the parents who object to the undertone are looking at it with their eyes, rather than trying to see it with a child's.

The booklet that came with the set was fun for me as a longtime fan but held no interest at all for the girl. The cards? Well, honestly they are just junk -- filler to make a nice neat bundle in the box. We ended up giving them to Goodwill just to get them out of the house since they kept falling out of the DVD case.

All in all, we loved it, but if you can find a full set on DVD without all the unnecessary swag, get that one. The extras in this set weren't worth the money.",1290211200,2,1363,4.086142322097379

But when we sat down to watch these DVD's, she was bored after a few minutes and I was appalled by the sexual inuendos and adult dialog.

  These stories may be acted by some of hollywood's great ""stars"" but don't be fooled by that fact like I was.

 These DVD's should NOT be viewed by children under the age of 13--as certain movies are rated PG-13.  The producers/directors of these DVD's should be ashamed of what they have made.  What could and should have been a wonderful experience for little ones by watching these stories come to life and being able to find the magic of so many classic fairytales, are NOT found in these terribly scripted tales.

2165055,3,B00063UEFM,"I have such fond memories of this series from my childhood. Our local public library allowed for videos to be checked out as well as books and I fondly remember my mother checking these videos out for my sister and I when we were young kids in the mid to late 80's. As far as I can remember our library only carried a select few of the episodes which were packaged individually as VHS tapes back then. My favorite of the bunch was The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out about the Shivers. Something about the macabre story was very compelling to me even as a young pre-teen boy. It wasn't frightening because I could relate to the ""Boy"" and shared is lack of knowledge about the ""Shivers"".

But any way I just wanted to express my enthusiasm for this collection so you could understand why, upon receiving and viewing my favorite episode, I am giving this collection a mediocre score. The biggest problem with this collection is the video quality. On the back of the case in bright pink letters it states: 26 SPELLBINDING STORIES DIGITALLY RESTORED AND RE-MASTERED. Now half of that statement is true (26 SPELLBINDING STORIES). The other half of this half-true staement (DIGITALLY RESTORED AND RE-MASTERED), is very frustrating. I say that it is frustrating because whenever this collection was being readied for mass-production I was not present and the time of the digitally restoring and remastering. That being said I don't know if it was restored or remastered. If it was, as it so boldly claims, there are two things that I have to say to any potential buyers,  One: I would hate to have seen the product before it was remastered because  Two: This is one of the ugliest digital restorations and re-masters I have ever seen, if not the worst. I have seen origianl VHS recordings that look sharper than this collection.

It's not unwatchable, but pretty much the entire time I was aware of the sub-par quality. The Original Star Wars Triliogy is older than this collection, so is JAWS for that matter. But the same care has not gone into this collection that was recieved by those mentioned. However to end on a good not and not to completely upset any potential buyers. The Collection is quite nice, every episode is here, along with the very eye-catching packaging. The storybook is an welcomed addition and the card game, which I haven't opened yet, looks good as well. Just to reiterate if you really must have this collection the low quality of the video presentation won't bother you too much (This is where I stand). If your looking for a crystal clear presentation only, well you WON'T find that ""your wish has been granted"".  ;) You'll see what that means.",1269302400,5,2665,4.6617021276595745

Some of the special effects would be considered old but today's standards, but it doesn't take away from how much I enjoyed them then or now. The only part that made me grimmace a bit was the incredibly cheesy intro music in the beginning, so if you have never seen them before please don't judge based on that. It is fun to see very famous actors such as Mic Jagger, Billy Crystal, & Robin Williams doing their respective characters & the episodes are well written based on the fairy tales with wonderful costumes.

2165058,5,B00063UEFM,"Shelley Duvall gave the English speaking world the gift of all time when she created ""Faerie Tale Theatre,"" a collection of 26 beloved fairy tales. Each fairy tale is presented with its own special twist, and with humor beyond your wildest expectations. I don't know how some of the actors were able to get through some of the scenes. This collection of stories was produced between 1982 and 1987. The casts are star-studded and directed by directors such as Tim Burton, Francis Ford Coppola, Eric Idle and Roger Vadim. These fairy tale plays are truly products of their time, which is part of what makes them so interesting. The artwork is generally phenomenal for stage play sets, and yet, at times, there is a campy feeling to the overall productions, which is absolutely intentional, and creates the unique magic, along with the dialogue, which brings the stories into our real everyday world. The featured actors are at their youthful, talented best, and it is a treasure to see them bringing these stories to life on film. The adaptations are fascinating, funny and extremely entertaining.

2165059,3,B00063UEFM,"Most of these glowing reviews come from people who remember this series fondly from their own childhoods. Any child of the 80s who grew up on The Neverending Story and Labyrinth is going to recognize and enjoy these films as well (although they are decidedly not the same quality, so don't expect brilliant special effects or tight, fast-paced storytelling. They have a similar feel to watching a stage production, and the kitschy sets and costumes lend to their charm). They are a fun piece of classic entertainment and I am glad to see them made available on dvd.

I give them a three star because when I sat down to watch them with my three-year-old, I was shocked at what I HADN'T remembered from my childhood, which is that many of the films are peppered with inappropriate language and sexual innuendo. In The Frog Prince alone we are treated to three or four exclamations of ""damn"" and the frog calls the princess a b*tch. A joke is made out of the expression ""sleep with you"" that fully acknowledges the vernacular meaning of that phrase. And when the transformation occurs we get to see a the princess clearly titillated by the presence of a naked Robin Williams in her bed (and try to get THAT hairy image out of your head!).

Note that I am not saying the films should be banned or are terrible or whatever; I'm just saying that this is not material suitable for young children. Which is fine, if it were not for the fact that these are marketed (and used by many, judging from some reviews) as family fare. Just be aware, parents, that you might want to preview each film before showing it to your kids (not every one has objectionable material) and be prepared to skip a few or do some awkward explaining.",1267056000,9,1718,4.55663430420712

Special effects are low tech and perfect for fairy tales because the story, characters and settings are enough to arrest and transport the viewer to the mystical realm - high tech tricks would break the spell of childlike wonder/joy created by Shelley Duvall's team.  I do think that a few of the stories are too intense for the very young (say under 6) who have not been exposed to monsters and mean witches yet.  Examples are Rumplestiltskin or perhaps Rapunzel and Hansel and Gretel.  But most stories will delight kids and many are hilarious for the whole family such as the Frog Prince (with Robin Williams and Terri Garr), the 3 Pigs (with Billy Crystal and Jeff Goldblum), and the Princess and the Pea (with Liza Minelli).",1261958400,,867,4.753333333333333

The packaging for this edition is good and definitely an improvement on the previous edition with a gold cover, in which 6 discs were stacked on a plastic spindle and the last disc was defective (the second side would not play).  However, I was disappointed with the image quality of the episodes in this edition.  They appear fuzzier and less crisp than on the previous edition.  The difference is perhaps unnoticeable to many, but I found it distracting.  I have actually just gone ahead and moved the discs from the previous edition into this packaging because I prefer the image quality of the previous set.  However, since that set is now out of print, it looks like this will be the only available option for most buyers.  Make no mistake, this edition is watchable, and it's better than nothing, but I prefer the previous edition and was disappointed with this supposed ""upgrade.""",1256083200,24,962,4.690476190476191
2165072,4,B00063UEFM,"First off, I love Faerie Tale Theatre, so the show itself gets 5 stars from me.  Whatever complaints I have about this box set or the newer one from Koch, it is truly great to have these shows available on DVD after years of being out of print.

That said, I now own both this box set and the Koch box set, and it's debatable which is better, IMO.  I also had problems playing side 2 of the last disc in this set.  There are only two episodes on that side, and fortunately for me they were not two of my absolute favorites, but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't play.  It seems that this was a manufacturer's defect if others are having similar problems.  I also do not like the ""spindle"" packaging, which makes it difficult to get the discs in and out.

However, I think I prefer the image quality on these discs to the Koch.  The image quality here is sharper and crisper whereas the Koch looks fuzzy to me and closer to the quality of a VHS.  The Koch houses the discs in a digipak which is of a higher quality than the spindle packaging here, so I think I will actually move these discs into that package (along with the last Koch disc, which has the 2 episodes that won't play from the other set).

Basically, I'm disappointed that neither one of these sets is perfect.  This one has better picture quality, but the packaging is inconvenient and the last disc is defective.  The Koch set has the better package but is of inferior picture quality.  As that's the only set currently in print, though, it looks like most people will opt for that.  The Koch picture quality is not so terrible--or even noticeable--but I was saddened that it was not as good since I figured I was getting an upgrade by buying it.  But I guess the important thing is that this show is finally available on DVD as it's a gem.",1256083200,,1815,4.312684365781711
2165073,5,B00063UEFM,"As all the other reviewers describe, it is a great set of dvds. Remembering Shelley's Faerie Tales was really nostalgic and funny. I do recommend this item.

Featuring music, film, and comedy stars as the characters in classic fairy tales--you'd be just as likely to see the same person Sunday morning (Mick Jagger as the Emperor in ""The Nightingale"") that you'd seen on Saturday Night Live just hours before.  Duvall's brainchild presents traditional stories in a non-traditional, humorous, and often poignant way.  Definitely worth watching again and again.

I was about 11 years old when it debuted, and so I remember watching and enjoying it to a certain extent, even though I thought it was a bit lame. Young people watching this now will probably find the cheap soundstage sets, the bad wigs and costumes, not to mention the very presence of Shelley Duvall herself, laughably dated. And yet the sheer amount of ""talent"" will boggle the mind. The question isn't who's in this, it's who ISN'T in it. And I'll admit the years have given it a certain charm in the midst of Cable TV's panoply of profanity, sarcasm and slickness. Faerie Tale Theater shares the awkward, sweetly earnest air of those old PBS specials, like the musical of Studs Terkel's ""Working"" (if anyone remembers that) or even Sesame Street.  I got this to watch with my 2 year old daughter as a break from Elmo, and she seems to enjoy it, to a ceertain extent, as well.",1240704000,3,1245,4.7110091743119265

2165116,5,B00063UEFM,"Once Upon a Time (in 1980), Shelley Duvall went to the isle of Malta to work on the film ""Popeye."" There, she also conceived the idea for ""Faerie Tale Theatre."" ""Popeye"" has long since been forgotten, but Duvall's unique live-action faerie tale anthology series (originally produced for Showtime Cable Network) has endured beautifully.
The New York Times praised ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" as ""a remarkable achievement."" The series premiered on September 11, 1982 (my 17th birthday) with Robin Williams and Teri Garr starring in a loopy version of ""The Tale Of The Frog Prince."" 25 more enchanting episodes followed. The Disney  Animated (Cartoon) Movie Versions of Classic Children's Literature may loom larger in the collective pop-culture consciousness, but Duvall and her production team (producers Bridget Terry and Fredric S. Fuchs) display far greater respect for the faerie tale genre than Disney ever did!!
  Using 1980's ""video magic"" the remarkable ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" crew actually do whisk viewers away to enchanted worlds  where dreams come true. Watching the entire series in one collection actually IS like watching a Storybook come to life on DVD. Praise is also due  Robert C. Jones, Mark Curtiss and Rod Ash, who wrote most of ""Faerie Tale Theatre's"" best teleplays.
  It is wonderful  to see lesser-known tales (such as ""The Boy Who Left Home To Find Out About The Shivers,"" ""The Snow Queen"", ""Thumbelina"", ""The Nightingale""  and ""Puss In Boots"") alongside the big faerie tale classics  (Hans Christian Anderson, The Brothers Grimm) we all love and adore! Duvall, Terry, and Fuchs  create a perfect mix of humor, horror, comedy, and drama here. Each tale has a different tone, and Duvall has an uncanny knack for knowing which tales should be played for wacky comedy (""Jack And The Beanstalk,"" ""The Princess And The Pea,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""The Three Little Pigs"", ""The Emperor's New Clothes"") and which tales should be played more for drama and pathos (""Hansel And Gretel,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""Rapunzel,"" ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,"" ""The Little Mermaid""). Notable directors included Peter Medak,  Robert Iscove, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Nicholas Meyer,  Roger Vadim, Tim Burton, and Francis Ford Coppola.
 Creator/Hostess (and occasional Tale Narrator)  Duvall herself appears as the wobegone Miller's Daughter in ""Rumpelstilskin"" and the title heroine in ""Rapunzel."" The  long list of other actors (in order of appearance) includes: Jeff Bridges, Gena Rowlands, Christopher Reeve,  Jean Stapleton (as the Giant's Wife in ""Jack And The Beanstalk"" and Fairy Godmother in ""Cinderella""), Malcolm McDowall, Mary Steenburgen, Joan Collins, Liza Minnelli,  Michael Richards (before ""Seinfeld""), Paul Reubens (using ""Pinocchio"" as a dry run for his ""Pee-Wee Herman"" persona), Carrie Fisher, Vincent Price, Vanessa Redgrave, Elizabeth McGovern, Rex Smith, Susan Sarandon, Christopher Lee, Billy Crystal, Lee Remick,  Jennifer Beals (enchanting as ""Cinderella""), Matthew Broderick, Eve Arden, Ben Vereen, Alan Arkin, Art Carney, Dick Shawn, James Earl Jones, Leonard Nimoy, Pam Dawber,  Helen Mirren, Karen Black, Brian Dennehy, Treat Williams  and Lesley Ann Warren.  WOW! This diverse group of  actors throw themselves into various faerie tale roles (be  it comedy or drama) with stunning conviction. In the particular cases of Gena Rowlands, Jean Stapleton, Joan Collins,  Vincent Price, and Vanessa Redgrave, ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" represents some of the best performances of  their careers.
  The 7 Disc Set presents each episode in the original broadcast order. Extras include: ""Faerie Tale Theatre's Greatest Moments"" (A.K.A. ""Grimm Party)"",  Original Presentation Reel, B Roll Promos, a Collector's Storybook with color production photos, and a deck of faerie tale playing cards.

2165117,5,B00063UEFM,"Koch Vision presents ""SHELLEY DUVALL'S FAERIE TALE THEATRE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION"" (1982-1987) (1387 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered)  -- Brought to you on seven discs the fairy tale event of the year arrives with Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection, the ultimate DVD collection for both kids and parents alike --one of the most acclaimed and universally beloved series ever produced -- is family entertainment like none other --- From the Brothers Grimm to Hans Christian Andersen, twenty-six of the most beloved stories of all time are brought to life by A-list actors (in some of their most unique and memorable roles) as well as master directors including Tim Burton and Francis Ford Coppola among them --- You'll in seeing Robin Williams as the Frog Prince,Eric Idle as the Pied Piper, Billy Crystal as one of the Three Little Pigs,Jennifer Beals and Matthew Broderick as Cinderella and her prince, Bernadette Peters and Christopher Reeve as Sleeping Beauty and Prince Charming, Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski as Beauty and the Beast, Paul Reubens as Pinocchio, James Earl Jones as the Genie inside Aladdin's lamp, and Carrie Fisher as Thumbelina.

Each one of these stories is literally hand crafted by the directors (some of them famous directors like Francis Ford Coppella) and Shelley Duvall to reflect a certain style --- An example being the Sleeping Beauty tale was set in Russia with the sets and costumes designed to look like scenes from classic Russian motifs, the music from the Russian ballet --- Another being the direct rip off of the classic Jean Cocteau film ""Beauty and the Beast"".

All of these were designed with the intent of entertaining not only children but adults --- Some of the best moments in these are only things that adults will understand --- Christopher Reeve does a fantastic job in his multi-role part in ""Sleeping Beauty"" as does Malcolm McDowell as the Wolf in ""Little Red Riding Hood"" --- McDowell infuses the character with a subtle dark sensuality --- His chemistry with his then wife Mary Steenburgen is strong.

Probably the best one of all is the ""Three Little Pigs"" with Jeff Goldblum (as the Big Bad Wolf), Valerie Perrine (as a ravishing piglette), and Billy Crystal(as one of the three little pigs) --- The writing in this one is completely off the wall as well as it should be --- So enjoy with a loving heart and the mind of an innocent child.

2165118,5,B00063UEFM,"I picked up this set today after having, unfortunately, to search numerous stores to find it.  I already own the version released several years ago, and after sitting through several of the episodes in this set, I have to say, its MUCH better than the previous released set.  Not only to you get a set of playing cards for the kids, there is a wonderful book which features a written synopsis of each show as well as air dates and several fun facts.  The shows themselves look and sound wonderful.  Much better picture and sound than on the previous release.  The sound is in both 5.1 Surround and 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Overall, if you have the previous set and have the money to spend, this is well worth the upgrade.  If you missed it the first time around, this is THE set to pick up.",1220313600,62,785,4.372413793103449
2165119,1,B00063UEFM,"This makes no sense to me at all.  I bought this for $19.99.  I believe the company that released it was Startmaker Ent.  Why would I spend $90 to purchase it again?  This is no way an ultimate boxed set!  It's just a reissue.  There is no digital remastering or THX sound.  The only difference is some stupid game and the extra ""greatest hits"" episode that wasn't that good.

Do yourself a favor, save $60 and purchase the Starmaker version on  eBay.",1220313600,13,451,4.402439024390244
2165120,5,B00063UEFM,"I'm so happy this has been released! I first saw these when they actually aired on cable in the 80's, and have been wanting to get a box set of the dvds.  The older box sets weren't so good ( from what I've read ). The cover to this collection is most intriging and the 100 paged book that comes with the set is definately most welcome. For years I've heard of the famous "" Grimm Party"" episode but had never seen it. Now, with this box set I get to see this famous "" missing episode""  My only complaint about the box set is the  people behind this box set didn't learn from the mistakes of others. Previous box sets were inferior due to the discs being stacked on top of each other.  In this set, the disks overlap one another, still causing the same problem. What they should have done is had plastic dividers and had one disk per side. ( much like what was done with the Granada "" Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" set). That's my biggest complaint and for some reason the middle disc ( I believe 4 or 5 ) fits in loosely therefore it constantly pops out on its own.  This has more to do with packaging than the episodes though. The quality may not be the best but its not the worst i've seen of the series either.  Actually while others praised the Starmaker II set, the transfer on this release looks better in comparison.  Maybe my copy of Starmaker was just a bad one.

As for the book and the card game. A very nice touch.  The book is filled with photos from the individual productions and gives and overview of the stories as well as cast list for the episode. The card set is nice. Not much to really say on it. A set of playing cards with the images of the characters from FTT.  As far as the individual episodes go, the only complaint I have is a lot of shelley Duvall's intros have been re shot. Instead of her in the princess outfit against a black background, they have her in more modern clothes with different opening comments.  personally, I prefer the original episodes.  I dont' know if this will be the last set of the series made, but if it isn't it would be nice to see the intros restored, and possibly have commentary by Duvall and others on the making of the episodes.

Given what is missing it may sound like I don't recommend this set. I actually do.  While its not the best thats been made, it does have some improvements.  Despite the over lapping discs, its better than them being stacked on top of each other. Its not that its a terrible release, its just not the definitive one that fans of the series were hoping for yet. In the mean time we have this new version to enjoy with the added book, card game, and the famous GRIMM PARTY ( kind of a cast wrap party ) which adds to the fun.",1220140800,2,2716,4.216216216216216
2165121,5,B00063UEFM,Great product from a trustworthy seller. Delivery took slightly longer than expected due to custom issues at the border. Seller replied via email quickly to explain this. Would deal with seller again without hesitation.,1219795200,,219,5.470588235294118
2165122,5,B00063UEFM,"For those interested, the KOCH Vision release of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre arrives on 9/2/08. The 26 Classic Live Action shows are accompanied by ""the missing"" episode entitled ""The Best Moments of Faerie Tale Theatre"", but more commonly known  as ""Grimm Party"".

All episodes have been digitally restored and the 7 disk collection also includes a 112-page book developed from original production notes representing short-story versions of all of the tales. This book includes an introduction by series producer Bridgette Terry.

Additionally, the set includes a multi-game game based on a deck of cards. Memory Match and Faerie Tale Theatre trivia can be played along with any standard card game one can think of, thus adding incredible dimension to the purchase...

27 episodes + 112 pages of bedtime reading + hours and hours of family game play....WOW...

This set is the one fans have been waiting for and my kudos to KOCH for putting it all together!!!!

By the way...the absolutely stunning box includes a gold-foil-stamped castle on the front.

I won't get into the content here, for the content is undeniably fantastic and everyone knows that. This is an incredible collection for young and old alike.

It's a faerie tale come true!!",1215129600,20,1253,5.107843137254902
2165123,4,B00063UEFM,"I grew up watching Faerie Tale Theatre and wanted my kids to experience fairy tales without the cartoon factor.  I hate television and hate my kids watching it, but for some reason the real characters in these movies make it so much better. This is a must have in every home.",1214092800,,275,4.392156862745098

2165126,5,B00063UEFM,"WATCHING THESE FAIRY TALES IS LIKE TRAVELING BACK IN TIME, A TIME WHEN THINGS WERE SIMPLE AND MAGICAL. THESE STORIES BROUGHT ME SO MUCH JOY AND WONDER WHEN I WAS A CHILD, AND IN MANY WAYS THEY STILL DO. SOME PEOPLE ARE SO QUICK TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM, EVERYONE IS A CRITIC... BUT THE POINT IS THESE STORIES HOLD MANY SPECIAL MEMORIES FOR SO MANY OF US, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE THEIR SECRETS, DONT BE SCARED OFF BY A FEW NEGATIVE NELLIES. GIVE THESE STORIES A CHANCE, THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.",1211760000,,516,4.329896907216495
2165127,5,B00063UEFM,"Charming, simply delightful.  This is for adults first, and children will enjoy it too.  This is so well done.

One comment on the packaging of the DVD SET.  The disks are stacked one on top of another in the case.  This subjects them to damage in handling.  Not good.  I put each DVD into a seperate sleeve which has the obvious disadvantages of being clumsey for storage.  But, at least they are protected.  A sign of the times...if they can make it cheaper, they will!

Wonderful fairy tales.  You will love this.",1211241600,,516,4.5
2165128,5,B00063UEFM,I just recently discovered Faerie Tale Theatre. They are wonderful. Great actors and very entertaining to watch. Easy to watch again and again and enjoy. Do not miss seeing these if you like comedies that are also fun to watch. I just purchased this set.,1208390400,,254,4.666666666666667
2165139,4,B00063UEFM,"While it could have used more diversity if you are a fairy tale fan Shelly Duvall's collection is a must-have for YOUR collection.

The production values are similar to a theater and it adds to the charm. The acting is top notch and even though fairy tales are often made romantic Shelly didn't miss a chance to include some humor.

My faves are Thumbelina starring Carrie Fisher and the Ice Queen starring Lee Remick.",1204848000,,418,4.635135135135135
2165140,3,B00063UEFM,I like all the Faerie Tale Theatre episodes. My problem is that we haven't been able to watch them all. The last 6 episodes are on a double-sided disc that won't play at all. The other discs are single sided and work great. It's  great to have the first 20 episodes but I paid for 26!,1204761600,4,284,4.071428571428571

2165142,5,B00063UEFM,"I didn't realize what a hot item this set was until I failed to purchase it when the price was drastically lower. This is a full set of all of the classic Shelley Duvall Faerie Tales that I remember from my childhood, and I am so glad to have this set to pass on to future children.

the price was great, I feel i got a great deal.

there are 26 DVD's in the complete set, and make a great addition to any family collection.",1202428800,,424,3.976470588235294
2165143,4,B00063UEFM,"I didn't have cable TV when this series originally came out, so I never got to watch it. I did, however, read the rave reviews at the time so I HAD to purchase it when I found out that it was available on DVD.

What a neat series! Some of the tales are humorous and some are decidedly weird -- a tip of the hat to the original versions of our fairy tales which are often dark and disturbing if you think about them too hard.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes seeing some of todays top actors when they were just starting out, to anyone who enjoys fairy tales, and to anyone looking for an unusual addition to their DVD collections. But if you have children under the age of, say, 10, I would pre-screen some of these tales before you let them watch.",1196121600,,755,4.164383561643835

2165147,5,B00063UEFM,I watched these stories when they first aired on Showtime and had to have the complete set to enjoy them all over again.  They have such a great cast of stars and the stories are classics.  I would recommend to anyone of any age.,1181347200,,229,4.181818181818182
2165148,4,B00063UEFM,"I purchased this set while fondly remembering scenes of these shows from my childhood.  While a majority of the story lines are boring, some of the CDs are entertaining to watch as an adult.  Don't get me wrong, I love the set, but just be prepared to sift through and find the episodes that you can enjoy.  I do plan on having my children watch them with me when I have kids :)",1180051200,2,378,4.1506849315068495
2165149,4,B00063UEFM,"My sister and I both grew up loving these whimsical, fun movies produced by Shelley Duvall. We would tape them on HBO and later the Disney Channel and watch them over and over. I was thrilled to find the DVD set after all these years, and I bought a copy for myself and for my sister - we have both so enjoyed the DVDs. They are pretty basic, but the quality of the films is great. Some of the special effects used in the stories are understandably outdated, but since the acting is so good, the tales are still great for your family collection. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is the packaging - the films come on 6 DVDs, one of which is 2-sided, and they're all on one spindle within the box. All of the discs played well, but it would be nice if they would put out a version with a little bit better package.

I'd recommend this for any child, family or kid-at-heart adult. :)",1179273600,,897,4.155172413793103

2165153,4,B00063UEFM,I just ordered this collection and can't wait to own it. I remember watching these as a kid and really enjoyed them. But later in life i discoverwed the cannon movie tales which are better and even better than that are the disney versions. I highly recomend this collection to lovers of fairytales. Butyou should check out the cannon movie tales and the disney versions first,1169942400,,375,4.696969696969697

2165155,4,B00063UEFM,"I had to buy this collection gift set because it brought years of great teleplay format theater from the 1980s back to my living room.  I remember watching these fairy tales when I was younger.  Shelley Duvall provides an introduction to most of the fairy tales before they begin.  (My sisters and I would usually taunt her with her artistically elfish voice.)  These shows were previously broadcast on public television stations, with most episodes appealing to both adults and children.  This 6 DVD set brings 5-6 episodes per disc of classic Brother's Grimm fairy tales staged as plays.  This set contains classics such as:

""Cinderella"" -starring Jennifer Beal (Flashdance) & Matthew Broderick (Stepford Wives)

""Pinnochio"" -starring Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee's Playhouse)

""The Frog Prince"" -starring Robin Williams (Aladdin) & Teri Garr (Mr. Mom)

""Rapunzel"" -starring Jeff Bridges (White Squall)

""The Princess and the Pea"" -starring Liza Minelli (Cabaret)

""Thumbelina"" -starring Carrie Fisher (Star Wars)

...and many many others

One downfall is that this DVD set is packaged sloppily with each disc lying directly on top of the other, instead of in its own plastic page within the case.  (Poor shipping may cause damage to the set due to this.)

Other than that, these fariy tales are fun to enjoy with your family and friends, especially if you don't mind the limited nature of the special effects in the 1980s (firework puffs of smoke, shoddy green screen work, etc.)

If you have trouble stomaching the voice of Ms. Shelley Duvall, don't purchase this set, as she stars in many of the episodes (especially the earlier ones) herself in many different characters.  (She plays ""Rapunzel"" with Jeff Bridges for example.)  Also it is amusing to see many stars in these tales in minor roles before they became famous.  Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfeld) was Princess Liza Minelli's father in Princess & the Pea, although she was probably much older than him.

Shelley also produced a ""Tall Tales and Legends"" collection which I haven't yet scene, but I think this set is more memorable for most people.",1167868800,7,2111,5.096209912536443

2165157,5,B00063UEFM,my family had worn out and lost almost every single episode of faerie tale theatre back when VHS was all there was. thanks to Amazon and this seller i can pass this on to my 8 yr old daughter (who looooooves FTT) and my family and i can watch them all over again. and believe it or not its even better and funnier the 2nd time around!!,1164240000,,335,4.014925373134329

I used to rent these tales on VHS when I was a kid, and to be able to own the complete collection on DVD now that I'm an adult is fantastic.

Now that a new generation has started in our family, we've bought the box set.  My two older nieces just love them; 'The Three Little Pigs' and 'Hansel and Gretel' are two popular favorites in our house!  Shelley Duvall's wit, combined with the traditional storylines, gives these old fairy tales a fun, humorous kick (a couple of them have mild innuendos) and makes them all thoroughly entertaining.

Keeps on giving a lot of pleasure...I had always thought the Fairie Tale Theater productions were very well done, but I did not have children when they first came out.  Now, with an 8 year old and a 4 year old, these stories give even more enjoyment.  There are so many other positive reviews that I will not repeat them here-only agree with them.  I will add, however, that whenever we allow our kids to watch TV--and we do have restrictions on what and how much they watch-these programs are a very worthy selection.  Our 8 yo daughter will always roll her eyes when we say to pick a Fairie Tale Theater story, but she always ends up enjoying the episodes (a control thing?!?!?!)and being glad of this choice.  Our son also enjoy them and he has gotten old enough to appreciate the wonderful and timeless stories.  While the stories and productions obviously all vary, The consistency of the series stands out strongly. I would identify this collection as one of the very best choices we have made for our family's collections.  We enjoy reading the stories and also watching with them and they truly are a gift of worthy family entertainment",1157846400,6,1268,4.575221238938053

The fairie tales are great, the cast is mind blowing, but there is a little surprise for the parents. Every so often, there is an hysterical adult-only joke. They are so subtle, at first, I thought I was imagining it. But after noticing a pattern, it can't be a coincidence. They are worth watching even without that. I am not a fan of reading fairy tales because I think they are too scary but somehow, most of these do not seem to scare my 7 year old. A few did but she is getting to be okay with them.",1156809600,2,636,3.9765625

The bright colors, set designs, and wonderful simplicity of it all make it seem as if you're watching plays.  And the music is so captivating, especially in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""  I catch myself humming these charming little melodies around the house since.  I have since I was young.  They just tend to stick with you.

What's great is that, with 26 different ones to choose from, you can have your pick of funny, scary, or romantic...whatever suits your mood.  From all the reviews, it's obvious that this collection is not only for the kiddies.  I, for one, am just as in love with them in my 20's as I was at 6.  So, unless you or your children are have a hard time finding pleasure in anything simple and light-hearted, I highly recommend making this purchase.

Shelly Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre shines out like a diamond in the rough. Don't just plunk your kid down in front of the tv and leave, watch it with him/her. You will both be delighted.

These are classic tales appealing to the imagination, lovingly presented by a staggeringly talented group of professionals.  The cast is a regular Hollywood Who's Who - Vanessa Redgrave, Vincent Price, Susan Sarandon! But it doesn't stop there, all the talent is top shelf - directors, designers, etc.

The stories are presented with a smart, tongue-in-cheek sensibility that makes it fun on every level, regardless of age. You can feel good about having your children watch these videos, and if you decide to join them, they will make you feel good, too.

I've always enjoyed the interpretations of these adaptations of the classic fairie tales, mainly because they are more accurate to the original tales than what Disney has put out.  Yes, the tales have been altered for time constraints but they give a wonderful picture of the tales themselves (as I have said before).  And the lengths of each episode is quite reasonable; I think most of them are under an hour in length.

I remember watching these shows when they were on and I couldn't wait to see the next one.  I was always quite fond of the Nightingale, Thumbelina, the Dancing Princesses, Aladdin, Snow White, and Cinderella.  And as I grew older, I became amazed at the talent that decided to act or direct these wonderful tales.

2165191,2,B00063UEFM,"I love Henson's The Storyteller, and when I happened across Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre in the video store I eagerly snatched it up.  I cut her some slack when The Frog Prince started out so slowly that the opening title finally showed up 7 minutes into the story. And I nodded with sympathy when Robin Williams (the Frog) was allowed to ad-lib for minutes at a stretch several times during the story, because I realize that he is hard to shut up. But when what should have been a pleasant, 15-20 minute story dragged on to nearly AN HOUR I realized that Eric Idle & Shelley Duvall have some serious problems with pacing and had no stomach for the cruelties of the cutting room floor.

  I watched several more Tales and found the same woeful lack of direction in acting, focus in writing and discipline in editing.  Even at fast-forward these stories were boring!

Such a waste of talent.

With the kitchy, low-budget sets and great starting material, this could really have been something worth watching rather than drudgery to endure.

  And they didn't seem to be talking to the kids much. Either the dialogue was condescending (when directed at the kiddies) or else sniggering (when directed at the adults). This was nothing like the double-layering you get with Rocky & Bullwinkle, Bugs Bunny or The Storyteller; it was clumsy and often inappropriate.

  I am at a loss to understand all the 4- and 5-star ratings here.  The Faerie Tales are tedious, clumsy and without the charm they should have had. I give a 2nd star because these are, after all, great stories and the idea was good.  With a little editing and keener screenplay, this could easily have been a solid 5-star.",1129680000,27,1691,4.704081632653061

2165195,5,B00063UEFM,"I grew up watching this show when I was a little girl; I am now 24 years old and the show still never fails to amaze me. I own the entire collection on the old CBS/FOX videos, complete with the collector's boxes intact, and I had been watching them for awhile, so imagine my surprise when I find out that a company has put the collection on dvd. I just purchased it and it is defintely worth a try. The quality of the picture is clean, and the sound is clean as well. The episodes are serious and funny, and they were made for children and adults to enjoy. Some episodes are definitely for the kids, while a few might be too serious, therefore, teens and adults would understand them better. So its for all ages, plus, the sets are cool because they try to recreate a storybook feel to it. And the humor has wit, which makes it all the better. Two episodes: ""Rapunzel"" and ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" have new scenes to it that weren't on any of the videos that I know of, and they help the episodes out a lot.""The Tale of the Frog Prince"" has the original intro added to it that was not on the videos as well. Also, a scene from ""Pied Piper of Hamelin"" was cut, (the scene where a rat that survives the terrible day tells his side) and I found that refreshing since it didn't make since for that scene to even be in the tale. Up until that point, that episode was the most serious out of all of the faerie tales, and all of the rats that were used were real, and they did not speak to each other; it was dealt with in a serious manner; so why are they going to put in a rat talking and acting like a human, telling his side of the story? Doesn't make since, huh? So its obvious the producers decided it wasn't right and they cut that one little scene out, and it makes the episode so much better. Okay, enough of that little tirade. Anyways, I think it is worth it to get this set, especially since it has come down in price and this is defintely something that parents with kids today should get because of a lot of the junk that has been coming out since the 90's. ( I am a child of the 80's and you know something is defintely wrong when there are lots of toys that you grew up with in your time, are all of a sudden coming back out with new revisions to it.) Obviously they are running out of ideas now. And especially since Hollywood isn't making too many good films or shows for kids, this is something that I think would be fun and interesting for kids today, and even educational in some ways, to get kids interested in fairy tales. It might encourage them to start reading some of the tales. I had always said that when I have kids that this would be something I would show to them to show that's what I grew up watching when I was their age. That's just my opinion, though, and I would defintely recommend this to kids, parents, and even the occasional movie buff who wants to see some of the best entertainers in stage, film, music,and television do some quality acting on these episodes.

So one day when I could no longer find any of the Faerie Tale Theatre movies, I was very disappointed.

Then I found the set on DVD!  I was thrilled to be able to interact with the characters and see stories that had darker overtones.  Rewatching them, I realized that these episodes have many different layers that allow all ages to appreciate them.  Young children can identify with the stories and the fantasy, while teenagers can find humor in the admittedly-dated effects.  And older teens on up to the elderly can appreciate the darker side of the stories, the parts and moments where they suggest that perhaps life isn't always this good and that there are ulterior motives even in faerie tales.  With this multifaceted appeal, charming acting and actors and visual effects that, while not the cutting edge, seem somehow perfectly suited to the slightly dreamlike quality all faerie tales and Faerie Tale Theatre possess.",1128211200,9,1214,4.916666666666667

2165210,5,B00063UEFM,"I had no idea this was out on DVD; it was just a pipe dream that I thought would never come true. Out of all the halcyon memories of my early '80s childhood, these faerie tales stand out the most. Once I was old enough to appreciate what Shelley Duvall had done, I marveled at what an awesome concept it was: take well-known tales, let famous directors helm them, and put celebrities in the starring roles. The good thing is that none of them seem to have more than one or two famous people in them, so that the tales themselves don't lose their sense of timelessness.

If you've never seen one of the faerie tales, I'm sure you will be impressed at how ""grown up"" they seem, not hokey or melodramatic or overly sentimental but somehow grounded in reality even in scenes where a heroine travels into a dream, or a frog retrieves a golden ball, or a big bad wolf quarrels with his wife. Admittedly, there are a couple of innuendos here and there, but young kids will not get them--I sure didn't.

The best part about many of these episodes is the music. In ""The Frog Prince,"" a young court musician (who is actually the episode's composer) sings a song that may seem throwaway but is actually quite haunting, especially for a kid's tale. And ""Thumbelina"" has some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard; I was so enamored with it that I arranged it for my orchestration class just so I could hear our philharmonic play it live.

Although my dad taped many of them for me when they originally aired, there are quite a few I had never seen. Though he recently burned them to DVD the quality is still rather poor, so it is one of the delights of the year that I can finally have the real thing for posterity. Believe me, you won't find a lot of entertainment these days as pure and enthralling as the faerie tale theater. If you decide to give them a chance, I promise you won't be disappointed.

Some of my favorites are ""The Dancing Princesses"" with Lesley Anne Warren; ""Snow White"" with Vanessa Redgrave; ""Sleeping Beauty"" with Christopher Reeve; ""Cinderella"" with Matthew Broderick; and ""Thumbelina"" with Carrie Fisher.",1123977600,13,2124,4.537859007832898

2165212,5,B00063UEFM,"I am so excited that these movies are now available again.  I grew up watching them.  My sister and I would play the dancing princesses over and over.  We never saw the full collection, but made it through quite a few of them and each time was fun and enjoyable.  I do, however, remember some of the movies being a bit freakish, as many fairy tales generally are.  Hansel and Gretel scared me to death when I was younger, but other than a few scary moments these movies are great.  I would say that each movie should be carefully considered according to the ages of those watching.  Some may be too scary for five yearolds for instance.  Ultimately run out and get this collection. It holds so many fond memories for me.",1123545600,2,720,4.401515151515151

Shelly Duvalls series is lifelike and tansports you to another world, I am also excited because of my mother, there were episodes I wasn't allowed to see and now I DO!!!  But there is yet another reason I made this purchase just last week, It is because of the horror of what is being done to faerie tales in America today.  Kids are being protected to the point that the stories are losing valuable life lessons, such as: if you tell a lie enough, it could put your life in danger, Dont talk to strangers, haste makes waste, dreams can come true, love can be a glorious thing and being a good and loving person on the inside is whats important not whats on the outside.

2165228,5,B00063UEFM,"I have to respond to the previous reviewer who dismissed the series as inappropriate for children and full of sexual innuendo. Obviously, Faerie Tale Theatre's prime audience today is going to be adults and teens who grew up with the series and have fond memories of their favorite episodes. However, it would be unfair to deny today's children the opportunity to fall in love with it as well. I honestly can't remember a series that sparked my imagination and sense of wonder more than Faerie Tale Theatre. Discerning parents of course should watch each episode before allowing their children to see them. The series had different writers and directors creating each episode, so that the style and content can change significantly from one to the next. Some episodes are very faithful adaptations of the original tales (more comparable to the reverent Storyteller series), while others use the source material as a jumping off point for more satirical or zany flights of fancy (think Fractured Fairy Tales or the Stinky Cheese Man stories). While the series never ventures beyond PG-rated territory, some episodes would be too ""adult"" to show in a classroom setting for example. I would advise watching ""Tale of the Frog Prince"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" especially before letting your children see them. However, I'd say the majority of the episodes are fine for all ages, and I hope a new generation of kids can enjoy this show just as I did. Thanks to these DVDs, I don't see why not.",1111104000,16,1484,4.916334661354582

What a waste of space that would have been!  This set is all 26 episodes on 4 double sided DVD's in 2 dual-disc Amaray cases which fit nicely in the included sleeve and take up very little room.  I am so thankful they didn't ruin them, as Warner does so often with their crappy, non-standard digipacks, which I despise.  I could go on and on about this, but I won't.

2165237,5,B00063UEFM,"Long before Disney, these stories were both terrifying and entertaining children. Then, during the 1980s, Showtime produced the Faerie Tale Theatre. This is an excellent collection of fairy tales, and features some outstanding talent, including the main narrator, Shelly Duvall. I loved seeing her in this role after not particularly liking how Stanley Kubrik used her in ""The Shining."" Other pople to look for in this great collection: Billy Crystal, Mick Jagger, Jeff Bridges, Elliot Gould, Elizabeth McGovern, Vanessa Redgrave, Treat Williams, Melissa Gilbert, Tatum O'Neal, John Lithgow, and the list goes on. While these stories are told in the traditional manner, each of them also contains a bit of an O. Henry type twist at the end. Very entertaining and well worth the price when you consider there are 26 discs involved and about 20 hours of footage. I also noticed that these productions are popular on Ebay, but the prices seem to run about $12 per episode.

This collection features productions of:

The Tale of the Frog Prince

Rumpelstiltskin

Rapunzel

The Nightingale

Sleeping Beauty

Jack and the Beanstalk

Little Red Riding Hood
