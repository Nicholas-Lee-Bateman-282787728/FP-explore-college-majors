Nirvana: Nevermind A 20th anniversary Tribute is a two DVD box set that pays testament to a revolutionary period in American rock music that went on to have a global effect. A number of key figures who passed through the Nirvana story are joined by celebrated journalists to assess a key album of the 90's and beyond-but, also takes stock of other key band releases and also pertinent players of that era. Cobain had a number of difficulties in the formative era of his relatively short spell on planet earth-and, that spiralled in to his Nirvana work and ultimately his own sad demise. However, it is evident that a seemingly permanently dispirited Kurt did have a love of music and  that obsession eventually develops in to a desire to form a band-and, from that juncture the tale of a unique talent unfolds.
The conversation is entertaining and it is evident that Cobain was not just a musician but a fan!
Kurt and Nirvana rode the crest of a commercial and critical wave. However, there is the subsequent toll of this rise to stardom and its disastrous effects upon the ultimate hero. Footage of this period magnifies the electric charge of Nirvana and their ultimately beleaguered front man, The action heads towards the closing album In Utero and the components of this groundbreaking long player are also disseminated by a selection of experts. It becomes crystal clear that Nevemind became a runaway train and it success was immense as its performers became lost in the furore of fame. The rise to the top was not expected and in essence not wanted and therefore record company executives wanted more of a winning formula but their star act wanted to turn their back on such a proposal. Nonetheless, this stance provided the listener with fresh challenges but a lustrous legacy was forged. The analysis becomes universally clear and that places the legacy of Nirvana at the forefront of 20th century rock n roll!
This blonde bombshell came with his troubles and triumphs and a traumatic passing in 1994 closed the compulsive Cobain catalogue. Nonetheless, the work that remains has left a significant imprint on contemporary culture. This 2 DVD set is a well researched, diligently constructed plus neatly packaged document-and, the contents do justice to an act that still attracts the punters.",1473379200,,2355,4.924433249370277
8474636,1,B005IGVTHO,Don't buy!!! This dvd set is a hack job.  Not authorized. Not a Nevermind tribute.,1444348800,,82,4.466666666666667
8474637,1,B005IGVTHO,"I wouldn't write up a bad review for this if the packaging wasn't so misleading. As another reviewer said, this has NOTHING to do with the album Nevermind. In fact the first CD focuses on In Utero (a nice analysis of the album, but not worth spending a lot of money on) and the second disc has the look and feel of a bootleg or a student documentary (no Nirvana music, just interviews with people who had some association to the band). Still worth a watch for the die-hard Nirvana fan. But rent it if you can; if not, wait until you find a cheap copy.",1343692800,,551,4.2075471698113205
8474638,1,B005IGVTHO,"This so called making of Nirvana is nothing like it claims.
Very little, if any, has to do with that classic album.
This is an unauthorized release- so Nirvana is not features nor is any of the music.
Total crap.",1325635200,7,212,4.325
8474639,5,B005IGVTHO,"Don't listen to the other person that says this is a turd and has nothing to do with Nirvana or Kurt, I just got done watching it a few mins ago, It was really good it talked about how they started, and the first CD on down, and it does show clips of Nirvana playing live there short I wish they where longer but oh well that's how documentary's are I guess, but it's good the second DVD is called Nirvana Untold Stories just Kurt's Grandfather and friends he grew up with talking about Kurt and the music and how he was live on stage.... I love this I would not mind watching it a second time I'm a big Nirvana fan, RIP Kurt Cobain, and this is not a turd of a DVD so I think the other dude does not know what's it about....",1322352000,3,725,3.9726027397260273
8474640,1,B005IGVTHO,This thing is a total rip-off.  It has nothing to do with Nevermind.  It is not an authorized release.  One of the DVD's is about In Utero and the other is a complete waste.  Nirvana does not appear and their music is not used.  This DVD was previously released as a box set that I mistakenly bought.  Now they slap the Nevermind 20th Anniversary packaging on the same terrible DVD's and sell this turd repackaged.  I only wish I could give a zero star rating as it does not even merit getting one star.,1322006400,26,503,4.287234042553192
