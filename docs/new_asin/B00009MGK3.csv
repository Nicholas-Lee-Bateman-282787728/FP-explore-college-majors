1885284,5,B00009MGK3,"I have enjoyed classical music for most of my life but I have never had exposure to opera. A new neighbor is very involved and she lent me a copy of this performance. I was hooked from the outset!!
  I suppose the purist might find fault with the presentation or a particular performer but I have viewed this several times and have been equally entertained in each case.
  I heartily endorse all the positive comments made in earlier reviews. All of the performers seem to be enjoying their time together and do a wonderful job. I particularly enjoy Robert Lloyd's La calunnia and Gino Quilico's Largo Al Factotum.
  This was a wonderful introduction to a new world of music!",1200873600,4,675,4.630252100840337

1885286,5,B00009MGK3,"'The Barber of Seville' - fast, fun, and, at times, frenetic, is well deserving of its title as the greatest opera buffa ever composed. When I was searching for a DVD of my favorite opera, there were quite a few choices available; this was the one I picked, despite being familiar with only one of the performers, Bartoli. I wasn't disappointed. This is a great `Barber,' that captures the energy and humor of both the story and score. When it comes to the `Barber,' I prefer a traditional staging, rather than a modernized, contemporary, conceptual, or experimental avant-garde one. This is a traditional production and proves the adage of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

The costumes, although neutral, (greys, black, and beige), are perfect; especially Figaro's ""Spanish dandy"" attire, complete with snood, as described in the original Beaumarchais play notes. Kudos to referencing the original source material. It almost seems as if the neutral tones of the costumes and sets was a deliberate decision, in order to allow the performers and music to provide the real color, which is abundant and full of infectious verve.

There is a lot of movement in this production, which compliments the score, and the cast is nimble, making extensive use of numerous props, but without any of the actions feeling forced or unnatural, nor distracting attention away from the vocals, which are excellent. A perfect example is when Figaro, while chatting with Rosina, warms a `curling iron' over the flame of a candle, prior to dressing her hair. The performers, especially the trio of attractive, youthful (looking) leads, act, rather than remain static, as they sing or deliver their recitatives; the cast has a well established rhythm and seem to be truly enjoying themselves, making it all the more enjoyable for the viewer.

Bartoli gives us a charming Rosina, displaying the character's winsomeness, coyness, slyness, and determination. Her ""Contro un cor,"" aria, in the second act, is simply lovely. Quilico is a solid Figaro and really embodies the crafty, titular character, although, on a few occasions, overplays a bit, yet when ""playing it straight,"" so to speak, he's great to watch. Kuebler, as Almaviva, is wonderful, expertly conveying the Count's lovesick nature (and the hilarious lengths he'll go to to win his Rosina). His ""Ecco ridente,"" is delivered in a bright, ringing tenor, and his acting skills, as well as comedic timing, are superb. He's almost chameleonic, so different is his body language and timber of voice in the beginning of the second act, as the fidgety Don Alonso, (a nice contrast to the `drunk' soldier at the end of act one, also wonderfully played). Feller's Bartolo is not presented as a buffoon; he's ever watchful and suspicious and, quibbles aside on the ""A un dottor"" aria, he makes a fine antagonist.

A previous reviewer commented on the smallness of the venue; this works quite well, actually. There is a more intimate feel and the smaller stage increases the sense of claustrophobia, making us more sympathetic to Rosina's plight, and convinces us of the difficulty the two lovers encounter when attempting to engage in a tte  tte or steal a kiss, helping the viewer to become emotionally invested in their affaire de coeur.

Apart from occasional moments when it's difficult to hear the performers on one side of the stage (either due to miccing or mixing issues)  and a few errors in the subtitles (act one for instance; Almaviva's ""avanti, avanti,"" - ""retire, retire"" to the musicians is translated incorrectly, making Kuebler's dismissive wave seem out of place) this is a must have performance DVD. For me, it has more than paid for itself through innumerable viewings; I never grow tired of it. My only regrets are that it is not presented in widescreen format and that no audio CD is available. If you're looking for a fun, traditional version, with laugh out loud moments, or if you're just beginning to explore the world of opera, this is the 'Barber' to add to your collection.",1188259200,20,4032,4.982169390787519
1885287,5,B00009MGK3,"I hate to sound arrogant myself by saying this, but I think you should ignore the arrogant comments of the previous reviewer.  If this production is ""pretty disappointing,"" then I'm Kirsten Flagstad.  The previous reviewer's comments are a perfect illustration of why opera fans have the reputation of being the most staid, humorless fault-finders around: for being almost impossible to please. I agree that one can always quibble about a few things in any production.  In this case, yes, Carlos Feller's performance is not flawless: his enunciation does slip a bit in ""A un dottor.""  But he makes the number so enjoyable overall, overall he is so terrifically pompous and irascible, and he sings with such gusto (for an old man, I think his voice is deep and strong, hardly ""hollow"") that to call him the ""horror"" of the whole production is, in my opinion, puzzlingly spiteful.  And the same goes for any major criticism of the rest of the cast.

In fact, I think this is one of the better casts I've seen in this opera.  David Kuebler is a hilarious and wildly determined Count (his turn as the drunken soldier looking for lodgings is a riot); I don't see how anyone in their right mind could consider him a ""dull, stern presence"" and ""charmless.""  True, it's fair to say that Bartoli has gone on to do even better work than she does here, but, after all, this ""Barber"" was filmed in 1988, early in her career, and one can at least see why her career took off after this.  Her Rosina is spirited and absolutely irresistible, her voice is beautiful, and her big coloratura number (""Una voce poco fa"") pretty spectacular.  Gino Quilco is a great Figaro, very funny, sharp, and energetic, with an excellent rendition of ""Largo al factotum.""  Also deserving praise is Robert Lloyd's wryly sinister Don Basilio. Lloyd earns the loudest applause in the whole performance, including many shouts of ""Bravo,"" for a terrific ""La calunnia.""

And who could forget the conductor Gabriele Ferro, leaing the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Stuttgart down in the pit.  Just watching him conduct the overture is almost worth the price of the DVD.  Talk about chewing the scenery!  His intensity and wild shaking and gesturing (reminding one of a Middle American snake-handler feeling the spirit) will leave your jaw hanging open and may make you laugh more than anything in the opera.  Ferro is so caught up in the music that his beat doesn't seem the most precise and his cues to the orchestra members don't look all that helpful, but you can't call him dull.  Even if you can imagine why his career hasn't exactly skyrocketed, you have to like him here.

All in all, this is the best of the five versions of ""The Barber of Seville"" that I've seen on DVD.  Any review that does not recommend this production ought to be dismissed.  I just grabbed my copy of classical-music connoisseur Phil Goulding's  book ""Ticket to the Opera,"" and I was looking to see which video version of ""Barber"" Goulding recommends. Can you guess? This one.",1148428800,46,3015,4.759615384615385

1885289,5,B00009MGK3,"This DVD preserves the justly famous production of Rossini's 'The Barber of Seville' done in the jewel-box theater of the Schwetzingen Festival in 1988. It features the adorable Rosina of Cecilia Bartoli at the beginning of her soon-to-be-huge international career. It is conducted sympathetically by the Sicilian Gabriele Ferro; he leads the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Stuttgart and the chorus of the Cologne City Opera.
The staging by Michael Hampe, sets by Ezio Frigerio and costumes by Mauro Pagano are traditional and do not get in the way of a straightforward presentation of Rossini's still-funny farce.
David Kuebler's Almaviva is beautifully sung and his comic acting as the drunken soldier in Act I and as the false Don Alonso in Act II is expertly done. The lecherous but clueless Don Bartolo is sung and acted by the veteran Carlos Feller. His downfall in the finale is done with grace and good humor, unlike some Bartolos who huff and puff rather too much about it all. Don Basilio is taken by the wonderful Robert Lloyd whose cavernous black bass is perfect for 'La Calunnia' which is both sinister and funny. He has a comic bit that he does with making the sign of the cross that has the audience in stitches.
Gino Quilico deserves especial praise for his scheming charmer, the barber Figaro. Not only is his singing wonderful, his comic acting is spot on. I laughed out loud several times--as when he is shaving Don Bartolo in the second act.
This production follows hard on the heels of the wonderful Arthaus/Naxos DVD of the 1990 Schwetzingen production of Britten's 'The Turn of the Screw.' If these two productions are any indication of the level of artistry at Schwetzingen, one can certainly hope that we'll be getting more of these productions on DVD.
Recommended.

The picture is good not h def, the sound is very good. The stage setting is proper for the period, which I like. Rather a small stage but the whole production is excellent.",1421107200,,310,4.271186440677966
7991771,5,B00009MGK3,The music and action is superb. I got this on Netflix and enjoyed it so much I bought it. Ceclia Bartoli is wonderful as are the rest of the cast. The settings aren't so elaborate as to take away from the music.,1389744000,,211,4.0476190476190474
7991772,3,B00009MGK3,"If you already like ""Barber"" you'll almost certainly love this one .. Bartolli is tremendous, which is why I ordered it in spite of not much caring for ""Barber"".  Kuebler and Quilico are fine .. but ""Barber"" just doesn't offer much for them to work with.  It really is a nothing sort of collection of odds and bits, some of which border on being tedious .. unlike the Marriage of Figaro which follows and is a musical marvel from beginning to end.  If you're looking for ""Barber"", this is very possibly the best around, if you're looking for Bartolli, try Cecilia and Bryn at Glyndebourne for a real whizbang of a performance.",1344124800,,626,4.571428571428571
7991773,1,B00009MGK3,"The DVD stopped playing before the end of the first act.  The subtitles stopped showing on the TV screen before the DVD stopped.  This is probably a problem with the original recording because I had previously checked the same performance from the local Tucson public library and that DVD has the same problems.

I tried to make a complaint to Amason on a different review request that Amason had sent me, but the return would not function.",1339632000,,440,4.688311688311688
7991774,5,B00009MGK3,"This Barbiere is one of the best productions ever done. There are no big names, except for Cecilia, but everybody sings and acts beautiful. This is the first Barbiere I own for which I have no artist I don't like. I love the Glyndebourne festival act, that one with Maria Ewing and John Rawnsley. Unfortunately for that, I don't like M R Cossotti's, count Almaviva. There is other production I own but I almost hate, the one with Juan Diego Florez, Maria Bayo, Spagnoli etc. I love JDF, and he was the only good thing on that DVD.
This Barbiere is almost perfect. Rosina is magnificently played by young Cecilia Bartoli. Her coloratura is amazing. Everybody knows her now.
I loved Gino Quilico, he made a perfect Figaro. His great voice and acting managed to describe the intelligent, perfidious Figaro. He was, may be, a little too handsome and young for the role. He had a surprisingly chemistry with Rosina.
Count Almaviva played by David Kuebler was a nice surprise. He has a light/lyric but powerful tenor voice. As a bonus was that he is really tall (rare for this type of voice) and nice looking.
The old Carlos Feller is a great baritone, with a grave bass like voice. His acting was perfect and helped for the comic moments of the opera.
Last, but among the best, is Robert Lloyd. His great quality bass voice gained huge ovations for his La Calunnia aria.
Berta played by Edith Kertesz had a great aria, due to her beautiful, powerful mezzo-soprano voice.
Gabriele Ferro conducting the Stuttgart Orchestra was himself a great treat. The overture is a show by itself, due to Rossini and the conductor/orchestra playing it.
This 1988 recording, in a cozy little, old theater, has a 4:3 display and PCM stereo (great) sound.
I guess Rossini would have been proud for this performance.
Amazing Barbiere, I can't stop playing it!",1297209600,7,1834,4.716510903426792
7991775,4,B00009MGK3,"Quite a performance. Most of all, for the luxury of bel canto from Cecilia Bartoli and Gino Quilico's splendid Figaro.

7991776,5,B00009MGK3,"This 1989 production of the Barber of Seville from the Schwetzingen Festival in Germany is a gem. Terrific cast, fine conductor and great director.

7991778,5,B00009MGK3,"This Barber stars Cecilia Bartoli as Rosina, Robert Lloyd as Basilio, Carlos Feller as Bartolo, David Kuebler as Almaviva, with Gabriele Ferro conducting. I really enjoyed it, but would caution some of the purists that it contains some minor cuts, such as at the end of the opera, they've dropped the scene where Bartolo wishes Rosia and the Count happiness, and also, Fiorello's recitativo prior to ""Una Voce Poco Fa"" is dropped. I really like s Carlos Feller as Bartolo; he reminds me a bit of Fernando Corena on the RCA CD set from 1958 conducted by Leinsdorf.  In this DVD, Feller's character is funny and clueless, especially in the scene where Figaro shaves him and he catches on to the trick being played on him.  Gabriele Ferro did nery wellwith this one; I've got his on CDs of ""La Cenerentola"" and ""L'Italiana in Algeri. Bartoli was very young when this recording was made, but is right on the button with the role. You'll love it.",1217203200,8,941,4.662650602409639
