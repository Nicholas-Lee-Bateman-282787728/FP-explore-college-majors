8292443,4,B001DAVUVO,"I saw this film at a university screening last year. Although there isn't much blood - it's more of a dark comedy - my group and I (and the crowd present) seemed to enjoy the film. It's hilarious - although some of the humor is low-brow, there are a lot of jokes that take some thought. The total nitwits of the world who only enjoy bloody films with nudity probably won't like this film AT ALL. But those who actually hold some semlence of humor should enjoy it. I did some online research and found mixed reviews for the film. It's an indie movie - it's not high-budget - I didn't have a problem with it, but I know some people who probably would (film snobs).

As mentioned,if you want blood and nudity, this isn't your film. If you like random, weird humor and a unique storyline, then check it out...",1316908800,,805,4.33112582781457
8292444,1,B001DAVUVO,"I literally watched this movie on a bet. a friend of mine challenged me to make it through this ""film"" in one sitting, saying it was so bad I wouldn't make it. In hindsight I should have conceded.

I can't decide what Karl Benacci is less competent at; writing, directing or acting. As an actor, Bennaci comes across as a less funny Tom Green.

The screenplay is a horrid mess, full of more putrid one liners than ""Batman & Robin"" and more homophobic slurs than a typical Eli Roth movie. It's not funny or scary, it is just stupid.

The concept is slightly interesting, but completely botched by hackwork that makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles.

This movie is terrible. There is nothing good about it. avoid it like the plague.",1309046400,,730,4.507575757575758
