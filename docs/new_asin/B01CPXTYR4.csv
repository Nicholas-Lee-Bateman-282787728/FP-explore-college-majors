7688381,5,B01CPXTYR4,"History that I was not aware -- so glad I watched this movie to learn more about Russian women in World Wars One and Two. I did some research on the Battalion -- fairly accurate. If you are a history buff like me, you will surely enjoy this movie.",1518307200,2,247,4.061224489795919
7688382,5,B01CPXTYR4,I got the feeling from other reviews that this might be too violent or something. I found it no problem at all. It is a very good movie. Ive been watching a lot of Russian History lately and find it all very interesting. If you're someone learning Russian and would like a few Russian films for your library this is an excellent choice.,1517011200,8,336,4.349206349206349
7688383,4,B01CPXTYR4,"Russian war cinema seems infatuated with graphic violence, and if you're a connoisseur of such you won't be disappointed by Fyodor Bondarchuk's ""prequal"" to ""Stalingrad.""  This film recreates  Maria Bochkareva's First Womens' Death Battalion (there were four commissioned by the Provisional Government under Kerensky.)  Ostensibly to build military morale in a faltering war effort, and ""shame"" the crumbling male rank and file, these were basically propaganda vehicles displaying the gender equality of the Revolution.  Bochkareva's was the only such formation to actually see combat, depicted here in all requisite horrors.  The inner battles of these women between their own femininity and the dehumanized demands of total war is portrayed as realistically as the period costuming and combat choreography.

Alas, if reality were only so easily directed.  The film is a product of post-Soviet revisionism, embodying the official view of the 1917 PG that enemy agents, drunkenness, and cowardice were the true reasons for the Russian Front's collapse.  In fact, being sent to die in waves for three years for goals that were always nebulous at best overthrew the Russian Army, as they had the Tzar beforehand and finally the Provisional Government itself.  No amount of isolated heroism, however genuine, could overcome such a badly-conceived and poorly executed war effort.

This was probably the first official war heroine since Joan of Arc and has served as a combat model for modern armies the world over, from Israel to the US. Maria Bochkareva herself is not well-explored as a personality here. We get little sense of what made her tick: why she sought military service and lobbied for this formation.  Nor is there is reference to her subsequent fate: exile, return to Russia under White leader Alexander Kolchak (also a subject of post-Soviet film revisionism, ""Admiral""), her capture and execution in 1920.  But this production does add to the trend's growing repertoire, breaking free of the official fetters of Soviet era history.  Tacking the pendulum the other direction - a task for the next generation - will come closer to balance.",1504396800,15,2149,5.303834808259587
7688384,4,B01CPXTYR4,"Well done, though somewhat melodramatic production. Would have appreciated Russian sub-titles as an aid to learn Russian. From what Russian that I know, the English translation on the screen as to why the former battalion commander was executed by the Communists is wrong. Still, a very good production of the World War in the East which is worth watching.",1502064000,4,356,5.0508474576271185
7688385,4,B01CPXTYR4,"The movie kept my interest and I was sympathetic toward most of the characters.  It was interesting that they had such varied backgrounds...an aristocrat, a general's daughter, a communist, peasants, etc.

I knew the Russians employed women in WWII, but didn't know that they'd also fought in WWI.

If you're interested in the German perspective of fighting them, read Degrelle's Campaign in Russia.  His unit attacked a position held by a unit of Russian women.  It was close combat and they noticed that one of them was very pretty and tried to capture her, but to no avail.  She was the only one that they buried.",1482796800,8,616,4.764150943396227
7688386,4,B01CPXTYR4,"In 1917 Russia was at war  with Germany and itself. The troops at the front were war weary and being run by Soldiers Committees,  the Tsar had been removed and the Provisional Government were fighting a losing battle for the hearts and minds of the people and the soldiers. So Minister of War, Alexander Kerensky, was charged with raising an all female combat unit. The first one was the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death and it was raised and led by a feisty soldier who had already been decorated  fighting alongside men  this was Maria Bochareva.

She ruled with an iron fist and this is her story as told through the women who fought with her. They were one of only two units that were sent to combat and this film portrays what they did, the obstacles they had to overcome and the men they went to help.

Now history purists may take exception at some of the events here but the Kerensky Offensive (which they were in) is actually done fairly well. The acting is all rather good and the materiel seemed fine too. I have seen one review which called it modernist propaganda but this is based on facts. A full film on the real life of Maria Bochareva would have been a great idea too from the little I have read of her. The film portrays most of the women as being heroines though and she is not set at centre stage. This though is still a film very much worth the effort and as such I am happy to recommend.",1475798400,6,1416,4.324528301886793
7688387,5,B01CPXTYR4,"well done, decent acting and a good story line. This film has English subtitles (linguistically coherent), Russian language only for audio so be ready for that.",1471305600,9,160,5.1923076923076925
7688388,4,B01CPXTYR4,"Actually was a very good movie. It did not pull any punches - showing the expected heroism, but also the fact that brutal war was perhaps not what they should be doing. The refusal to fight by the men forced the high command to push this battalion into battle before they were ready, with inevitable consequences. Well written script, and good acting - all put into a historical setting that made it seem plausible and real. And it was a true story. Very well done movie.",1469750400,13,471,4.488372093023256
7688389,1,B01CPXTYR4,No did not meet my expectations. Was unable to play it. Not formatted for us players. Disappointed. They promptly refunded my money.,1464480000,,132,5.045454545454546
7688390,2,B01CPXTYR4,"Well, let me lay out my credentials first, before anything else: I was born in Soviet Union and have lived first 33 years of my life in USSR and post-Soviet Russia. My second lifetime so far is 24 years in USA - thank God. I am well-educated, intelligent person with multiple interests in both natural and humanitarian sciences - please, don't take this as boasting, my many friends will vouch for all of that, but  that  is  not  the  point - the point is that I just want you to take very seriously what I want to say here. That also means that I have two rather polar experiences, both sufficiently adult to see many things for what they really are.
Regarding this film and more: Mr. Bondarchuk is son of Mr. Bondarchuk Senior, rather famous Soviet actor and movie director, who created many patriotic films that were essentially serving Soviet propaganda purposes. Mr. B Senior was a talented actor and somewhat successful film director, who chose to obediently serve the state and the party rather than be what he really could be... his son, as it seems to be common, doesn't even possess those talents. Most of his production was judged to be middling or an outright failure by independent film critics and free-minded intellectuals (I watched some and I agree), and this film fits that pattern as well.
I understand, that a lot of people unfamiliar with past Russian history and current state of affairs there may take this film as a kind of manifest of women liberation, if only by means of participation in war, or just see it as another ""heroic"" war movie - well, I beg you to reconsider. Attentive and educated eye will spot rather explicit militaristic propaganda all over this production, starting with the whole narrative, down to minute scenes - Motherland is before anything else, just die for it, all foreign people are occupants spies and cold-blooded killers, Russians can sometimes be wrong but are good at the core, and so on... that plays oh so well into Russia's recent isolationist practices and revival of militarist atmosphere, so reminiscent of a Stalinist USSR... You may want to know (even if you don't) that Russian auditory will see this story very differently from the Western one, due to the specific cultural background and current propaganda state there. And, even though this film's main target is clearly internal, I feel that people here, too, can be very susceptible to the sublime pseudo-patriotic messages that are so persistent in this film.
As to the cinematic properties of this production, it's nothing special to me - yes, there's some very good acting there (Russia was never short of great actors), camera and special effects obediently follow Hollywood lead, but the story itself is rather straightforward if not downright plain, at the same time heavily deviating from actual historical facts - probably due to the directives to make it more patriotic, and some dialogs are downright silly.
So, if you don't mind supporting Russian propaganda efforts by watching this, go ahead - still, I absolutely regret doing it, even if only for wasting couple hours of my time on this garbage, but at least I can write this warning for you based on my actual experience.
Anyway, I'm giving it extra star (it's two now) for actors' play... what else could they do.
P.S. I just looked this film up on IMDB, and it can't even be found there - that also says something... but why would Amazon put Russian propaganda film on their website? Oh my...",1528243200,2,3482,4.796666666666667

7688396,5,B01CPXTYR4,"Excellent if violent story of Russian women's' battalions formed in the first world war.  This is a Russian made film and there is no English dubbing.  You have to be willing to read the subtitles.  It's refreshing to see a movie where you don't know any of the actors.  It removes that ""star"" quality and makes the story much more authentic.  Great acting, period costumes and battle sequences put this film in the top tier.  Had this on my watch List for a while before I decided to watch it.  Enjoyed it very much and look forward to more Russian made films.",1521590400,2,561,4.4411764705882355

7688398,4,B01CPXTYR4,"July 4th. I just watched this movie again and have to add a few remarks I've added another star.

Propaganda aside, I still like the movie. As for fighting for the mother land, don't all soldiers do that? Why else would they be out there?  Maybe other countries just don't speak to their duty in the way the Russians do. As for propaganda, All countries do the same thing. Until recently (Nam) how many movies made by the US showed cowards, deserters and nut cases. WW 11 movies were full of ""propaganda. How many US soldiers died fighting battles for no good reason ( A Bridge Too Far)? I like this movie more than the first time I saw it because of how the Russian men and women display their goals. Doesn't matter if we agree with them. I am continually amazed at the bravery, strength and emotion displays by the Russian people. I'm not talking about any government.
1st review
I have never met a woman who has gone into combat so it's hard for me to judge how realistic this movie is. From other reviews I see that this battalion did exist. I think they could have been better trained and I don't know the time constraints they had to prepare these women to become soldiers. I've had many conversations about women being ""allowed"" to go into combat. I'm sure there are many qualified women and many who would not be good at the front. It's interesting that with all of the emotion that the women showed, they still did their jobs to the best of their ability. I found this movie a lot bloodier than others I have watched, but it's recently made and the world likes to gore. It's not over the top, just a lot more blood spatter. This is a great piece of history that I think a lot of us did not know about. Officers can't go into battle? Troops can for a committee and decide not to fight? Wow!  Glad I watched it and look forward to more films from Russia. Of course they are bias, as are our films but that doesn't lessen what we can learn about the mind-set and how they faced war.",1520640000,,1988,4.310160427807487

7688400,5,B01CPXTYR4,"An excellent movie! Perfect cinematics, outstanding acting, realistic war scenes, and best of all, a great story. This is a movie you won't soon forget, based on an actual woman's battalion during World War I.",1520121600,,209,5.0
7688401,3,B01CPXTYR4,"Decent from a historical point of view but certainly not a recommendation for women in combat. Presents them as too emotional, lacking the strength to overcome the male soldiers, etc. Today's Kurdish women would kick their butts.",1519603200,2,229,5.216216216216216

7688405,2,B01CPXTYR4,"I've watched several ""Jason"" produced war movies that at made for the Russian audience.  They all follow a common theme.  They are simple, sentimental and play to basic emotions of the Motherland and soldiers defending it.

8753680,4,B01CPXTYR4,"Another very well produced Russian War movie. Great cinematography, very good acting, great period settings, costumes, and equipment. Some really stupid combat scenes, however. It was called trench warfare because you fought from a trench. If attacked you had a significant defensive advantage. You didn't get out of the trenches and rush out to confront the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Lots of cliches as Russian film makers are won't to do.",1532217600,,444,5.267605633802817
