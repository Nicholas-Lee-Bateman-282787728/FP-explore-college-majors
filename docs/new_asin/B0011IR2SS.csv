3067160,2,B0011IR2SS,"With Pistol Whipped, Seagal has made an effort to make two good DTV's in a row with Urban Justice being the previous release, but he generally fails. Pistol Whipped is more of a thriller than an action film and as such is a little slow to get going. It also has the strongest cast that Seagal has worked with for some time. The unfortunate thing about this is that it glaringly shows up Seagal's inability as an actor.

When Seagal has confrontational dialogue or is in a scene with another actor that could lead to a physical confrontation, Seagal lights up the screen with the confidence he exudes as a martial arts expert which made him a star in his early films, he is truly believable as someone who could snap your neck in 2 seconds. When he has normal character dialogue to deliver in Pistol Whipped, it is flat, unemotional and boring to listen to. Seagal makes no choices as an actor as to how to convey any emotion in his lines, there is no life in his performance during these scenes.  No one watches Seagal films for the acting but it is disappointing to have to watch someone do a job and see the look of complete disinterest in their face.

Seagal again beds a very young woman in Pistol Whipped and there is also some of the ego massaging dialogue that appears in many of these DTV's spoken to Seagal. I'm surprised the actress delivering the lines could keep a straight face, this occurs at a breakfast table after a night of supposedly hot passion with Seagal's character.

Overall, one positive thing that director Roel Reine has done is to pull the camera back during the choreographed fight scenes. There are several quick fight scenes throughout the movie and one longer choreographed fight in a bowling alley against multiple opponents that looked impressive considering the budget and time constrains of shooting choreographed scenes such as these in DTV's. The action set pieces are well staged and look professional, the car chase although of a higher quality and with more energy than the car chase in Urban Justice is still rather dull and again the rear projection scenes with Seagal supposedly driving the car during the chase scene are obviously just that, rear projected. The final shoot-out taking up the last 15 to 20 minutes of the film has Seagal as part of a 3 person team rather than a one man army as they go to the graveyard to take down the villain.

As for body doubles, I noticed only one scene with an obvious body double and that was a wide shot of Seagal's character walking on a roof top of a building to the exit door. Another possible body double shot occurs in the beginning with Seagal's character walking up some interior hotel lobby stairs. There is also an appearance by a body double during the shoot-out just before the car chase but it's not that noticable unless you are really making a point of looking for it. Other than that it looked to be all Seagal to me. Pistol Whipped also looks much more expensive than its budget which would be down to the cinematography and is probably the best looking DTV that Seagal as been in. If Seagal has any sense he should make a point of continuing to work with both directors Don LaFaunt and Reol Reine in the future.

To non Seagal fans who have a passing interest in seeing what Seagal is up to, I'd say it might be worth a rental. For hardcore Seagal fans, this is an above average Seagal outing.",1201478400,18,3396,4.531810766721044
3067161,1,B0011IR2SS,"Another Seagal film and another waste of my time! If the movie was 20 minutes long it would be one of the greatest action films of all time. I can't stand these low budget films, I hate how instead of giving us what we want we're subjected to seeing Seagal walk around talking and smiling for 90 minutes. If the man could act, if the script was well written, then it would be a different story. When we do get action, it's mostly body doubles. The only good thing about this film is the final shootout at the graveyard. It was done like a pro but they obviously put their entire budget into that and relied on the script and Steven for the rest. The movie is a failure and should be avoided.

I also saw Van Damme's new film The Shepherd which comes out the same day and it was freaking spectacular. It was filled with martial arts, high octane car chases and tons of action. Why can't Seagal give us that?",1201046400,3,906,4.236994219653179

Film includes, fighting, killing, car explosion, and tough talk.

Boy, was I wrong! Seagal does the usual bone-crunching and throat punching, so that was a good thing but nothing unexpected. Pretending to believe a guy who weighs more than a yak and is older than dirt is capable of such things just adds to the enjoyment and makes one smile. But what propels this movie into the awesome category is his ending hard-guy line which is the greatest piece of dialogue ever written and performed in the history of movies.  I won't ruin it for you but suffice it to say my son and I laughed for 2 hours afterward.  Buy it just for that one line and you will be saying it non-stop for months (possibly for life).

3067210,3,B0011IR2SS,"This is one of the better ""direct to video"" efforts from Seagal in recent years. No corny props or annoying voice dubbing. The fight scenes look good and there's a nice balance between shoot-outs and the use of Aikido. No highly obvious stunt doubles as well. Plus, I really like how the movie was filmed - VERY nice camera work on this. And very good use of slow-mow cameras and sound effects. All-in-all a well-shot, produced and directed movie. But, as with most Seagal films, there's always a catch. In this film it is the very bland and unengaged storyline. Crooked cops, Seagal gets framed, blah, blah, blah...However, I did like how at the end of the film, there is no attempt to take him from ""bad guy"" to ""good guy.""

3067211,4,B0011IR2SS,"Steven Seagal will never be acclaimed as a great actor,but his films are action packed and exciting.

A benefactor (Lance Henriksen)buys his ""markers"" and allows the disgraced gambler to ""work off"" his debt by assassinating various bad guys. Standard Seagal fare here,lots of shooting,car chases,and of course Steven beats up hundreds of guys along the way. Nothing great or original here,but a great 90 min.thrill ride.",1258416000,2,635,5.174757281553398
3067212,3,B0011IR2SS,"Steven Seagal is back again.  The man's direct to video output in recent years, has been quite remarkable.  This time he is Matt Conlin, an ex-cop with a huge gambling problem.  His markers totaling over a million (yeah right), are bought up by a shadowy figure identified only as the 'old man' (Lance Hendrikson), who proposes that Conlin work off his substantial debt, by acting as a hit man.

With his back against the wall, Conlin acquiesces, and begins receiving his assignments from Blue (Paul Calderon), who works for the old man.  After a couple of very untidy hits, Conlin faces a crisis.  His next target is Lt. Steve Shacter (Mark Elliot Wilson), a cop, a friend, and husband of his ex-wife.

This is an atypical role for Seagal, who usually plays characters that are independent, and motivated by some moral code.  Money rarely is a consideration.  Things are different here, where much seems to be about money.  Conlin's family figures in the mix, but his priorities appear to be clear, when he cancels a visit with his daughter, so he can go out and kill someone.  Troubled by the turn his life is taking (is that a surprise?), Conlin consults his priest (Bernie McInerney), but can there really be absolution for a contract killer?

As you might expect, the level of violence is high, with the hits being very up-close and personal.  Seagal has a couple of minor fights, but most of the action is gun related, with one big shootout in the street escalating to car chase.  The film's finale is a wild shootout in a cemetery, with plenty of flying bodies, and exploding headstones.  Conlin takes out a ton of cops, and barbecues a good friend, but somehow escapes doing any time.

There's plenty of over the top action, though no one is actually pistol whipped, in this quite twisted film.  There is little that is admirable about Conlin, who apparently reconciles with his family, but continues working as a hit man, getting his assignments to kill, while praying in the same church where his priest breathed his last, because of him.  It really seems to be all about the money, as Conlin pulls the For Sale sign from his lawn.

3067217,2,B0011IR2SS,"""Pistol Whipped"" is one of the better films of Steven Seagal in recent years. It is far better than ""Flight of Fury"" and ""Attack Force,"" two dismally terrible flicks that can kill anyone's career instantly. Somehow Seagal has survived them and come back with ""Urban Justice,"" which is certainly an improvement over the previous ones. And now ""Pistol Whipped"" arrives, which is not a bad film, thanks largely to the capable supports and nice stunts, but still is not as good as his earlier films made back in the 90s.

The biggest problem is Steven Seagal himself, or the character he plays. ""Pistol Whipped"" is about Matt, a compulsory gambler who, despite his down-and-out life, still loves his daughter. Seagal plays this anti-heroic protagonist, who is also a disgraced elite cop and now perpetually drunk, but he simply does not look like the man he is supposed to play.

But when action scenes start, things get better. There is a nice car chase and a shoot-out in the cemetery. However, you have to wait for these actions very long. As to Seagal himself, martial arts action scenes are only slightly better than choppily-edited ones seen in his previous flicks, but are still disappointingly brief and few in number.

Probably the film's greatest merit is its supporting actors: Lance Henriksen and Paul Calderon. Lance Henriksen appears as a mysterious man who hires Seagal's character as assassin. His charismatic presence is intact, but he spends most of his screen time (which is too short) doing nothing particularly impressive. Paul Calderon, who almost became Jules in ""Pulp Fiction"" (but the role eventually went to Samuel L. Jackson), fares better as an enigmatic henchman ""Blue."" You can see this underrated actor is in fact as talented as Samuel L. Jackson. Perhaps the film could have been better with them as the leads with Seagal as support.",1222473600,,1861,4.958333333333333
3067218,1,B0011IR2SS,"Alright, first of all He always wears a jacket.  Is it because he is 50 lbs overweight?  Seriously the whole movie, people wearing shorts and tee shirts and mister Wayne Newton, with fake, slicked back hair and crazy fake spray on dark A tan, is walking around wearing a jacket the whole damn movie.

OK, enough of the petty stuff (but seriously more will come later), this movie has absolutely no plot.  He can shoot the tip off of a match, but when it comes to a target the size of what should be an out of work actor he misses constantly, and in a very boring, but consistently boring way.  You know the scene in the Matrix 2 where Keanu beats a bunch of agents with a parking meter for 45 min.?  The way it made you want to go to the Warner Brother Studio with a parking meter of your own an 45 min to spare?  THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS LIKE THAT.  It just kept going, and going.

Every time an expensive car is shown in the movie get ready for the director's attempt to get his foot in the door of the car commercial industry.  It was to the point that it COMPLETELY detracted from what should, but probably couldn't ever be an actual movie.  The director knew that at best he could shoot a car commercial, which is probably how he ended up with Segal, at a Hyundai dealership, hatching up this whole movie as a genius scheme to get a sweet Santa Fe for free.  So, so very insane, and transparent.  Tisk, tisk Segal.

Last and least was the conversation between the girl at the bar and Segal.  I don't know how else to put it, but the manner of speech changed drastically when he was around this African-American woman.  If my mind was not entirely consumed with other obvious and constant flaws in the movie, it might have the capacity to be offended by this.  On a completely different note, what the hell is the deal with his contact with Blue?  Is he supposed to be Jamaican?  He sounds undeniably Jamaican in exactly two scenes, but in all the rest of the scenes, just sounds like a regular bad actor that is not unsuccessfully attempting a Jamaican accent.

For the love of God, don't watch this movie.  If someone recommends it, punch them in the face or at the least the face of their groin, then just empty a large bag of skittles over the victim on the floor (the guy that just got groined), trust me it really, REALLY confuses people.",1220572800,,2343,4.30365296803653
3067219,4,B0011IR2SS,"Unlike his fellow action heroes Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal never got to work with John Woo, but his opportune teaming with director Roel Reine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2/dp/B0046BI81W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2</a>) brought the Buddhist Bonecrusher about as close to ""heroic bloodshed"" subgenre as he's going to get in one of the best DTV titles he'd ever release...

Sure, it's still just a Steven Seagal movie, but at long last, it's one that can actually be used to attract new fans.

The story: ex-policeman Matt Conlin (Seagal) lost his job and family to the vices of gambling and alcohol when he's approached by the agent of a mysterious, gentlemanly ""Old Man"" looking to put his lethal talents to use (Lance Henriksen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00000ILDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>). Matt finds new purpose in life as a hitman attacking the city's criminal underbelly, but finds himself at odds with honor and duty when his family is dragged into the mix.

""Pistol Whipped"" was written by J.D. Zeik, the pen behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin/dp/B000ERU9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin</a>, and when interpreted by director Reine's able hand, the script makes for the most complex and dramatically intense outing that the usually one-note Seagal has ever been on. For one thing, it's a decently complex story of double-crosses and fragile relationships, but unlike manure like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>&nbsp;which simply confused you in the process of trying to appear smart, this one is surprisingly streamlined - keeping you in suspense but not causing any headaches. Additionally, the mere fact that Seagal's not playing an invincible superman but an individual afflicted by worldly ills is an elephantine step forward for Steven. Dramatically, it's clear that he's on uneven footing, but he still gives one of the more layered and sophisticated performances of his career. This isn't saying much, so it's a good thing that he's got the likes of Renee Goldsberry (""One Life to Live"") as his love interest, Paul Calderon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Castle/dp/B004BGJXIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Castle</a>) as the Old Man's enigmatic enforcer, and B-movie god Lance Henriksen to support him, creating one of the most capable ensembles you'll ever see in his movies. Even relatively unknown names like Lydia Jordan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kidnapped/dp/B000N3T0EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kidnapped</a>) as Matt's neglected young daughter and Mark Wilson as her two-faced stepfather do significantly good jobs, to the point that you can almost forget you're watching a Steven Seagal movie and can just think of it as its own capable action-thriller.

I could go on about the film's dramatic strengths, but of equal importance is the film's action content. In an interview, director Reine mentioned how he wanted the halt the embarrassing trend of modern Seagal action scenes relying heavily on stunt doubles and stand-ins, and I'm happy to say that, for the first time in a long while, Seagal is looking back on-form with his younger self. There aren't as many fight scenes as many of Steven's other pictures, but they all look pretty painful and feature long, uninterrupted shots to show that it really is Steven doing his own fighting. There's also a pretty decent car chase in there with a couple good crashes. The gunfights fluctuate between old hat and classy, with the finale in the graveyard being a complete triumph of style.

Occasionally, the writing does bear a loose end or two (e.g. who sent the assassins after Matt in the beginning?) and the film's visual style is clearly limited by its budget. Because of this, there is a chance that viewers who turn down Seagal's DTV fare simply for being DTV won't be as blown away by this as I was, but I like to think that true fans will be impressed and delighted by how far our hero came with this picture. It's safe to say that Steven's never done a movie quite like this one, and for that reason alone, it should be worth a buy. Go for it.",1218067200,2,4884,5.9629101283880175
3067220,5,B0011IR2SS,"Another great movie recommended by Sid the Elf!

Have been a fan of Steven Segal since he's been kicking but in the late 80's as slick Italian cop with attitude. This more recent movie takes a different direction with Segal's trademark attitude, and it surprisingly works.

First thing I noticed about this movie is that Segal looks awful! Looks like he's been in a real bad accident and had tons of reconstructive surgery on his face. But alas, this imitation of Elvis' famous I-Just-Died-On-The-Toilet bloated look is just time catching up with the actor. That and the frizzy hairpiece he's now wearing.

The movie itself is classic Segal: snapping arms, blurring punches, and a scowl that still scares. His most famous--if not most used line--of `Let me ask you something,"" is used more than 20 times in this movie. Count for yourself and see. We are also blessed with the guy most unlikely to bed a girl, as Segal snatches a girl from a bar. Putting on more than 50 pounds since his slimmer days, this gives us ""average Joe's"" hope for an unlikely future. And we also see Segal's tender side--a great change from the wife-beater we all know--as he tries to be a good father to his daughter, despite being a degenerate gambler who owes too many people too much money.

I was highly impressed with this movie, learning once again to trust Sid the Elf and their many reviews. Always a skeptic, I like to see for myself. Glad I did. Segal still has it, bloated-with-hairpiece or not!",1209254400,10,1483,4.670498084291188
3067221,1,B0011IR2SS,"...unfortunately, ""Pistol Whipped"" is an incomprehensible kettle of kaboom. Unlike Segal's previous film - the tight and fun ""Urban Justice"" - this one has no discernible story, no explanation for who's doing what, done what, or why and has more plot holes than it would take to fill the Albert Hall.
I watched it with my wife (who, like me, likes Segal) and she had the same reaction: why were all these people doing this and who were they?
No answers were forthcoming...",1208649600,3,472,4.698795180722891
3067222,3,B0011IR2SS,"Who in their right mind could turn down movie with Steven Seagal called Pistol Whipped?  Most folks I'm sure, but we're talking about people in their right minds.  If you're like me, you're a glutton for the Seagal punishment.  In Pistol Whipped he plays a disgraced cop who's turned to a life of booze and compulsive gambling(since Seagal only has one facial expression, it stands to reason he'd be a good card player).  He's also divorced and not spending much quality time with his daughter(but he proves he'll kick your behind if you get in the way of his weekly visitation).  One day he gets a proposition from Lance Henriksen, a powerful underworld type figure who goes by the name ""Old Man"".  Old Man has paid Seagal's gambling debts and now employs Seagal to basically be a hitman in order to pay him back.  The target is a guy doing under-the-table deals with North Korea and everybody attached to him.  When Seagal's buddy(and stepfather of his daughter) ends up on the list, he decides he wants to get out of the whole thing.  Turns out though that his buddy really is a schmuck and that Seagal might just be working for the good guys after all.
It seemed early in the film that this might have been an attempt to do something different with Seagal.  Making him into kind of a loser character could have been a nice change, but as soon as we're shown his vices they almost immediately fade out of the picture, and he goes back to just being ol' Slabface Seagal again.  Kind of a waste.  Plus, the movie suffers from the same irritating crap that plagues mainstream action films.  By this I mean those pointless moments where the camera has to speed up or zoom in real fast(usually accompanied by a loud ""Whoooosh"" sound) while Seagal is doing something terribly exciting like walking down a flight of stairs.  And if you were a director who had access to Lance Henriksen, why would you use him in only like 2 or 3 short scenes?  Henriksen can't help but be the coolest guy on the planet regardless of the film he's in.  Why not use him more?  I suppose they only had Lance for one day(or more like one hour) since his very few brief scenes are all in the same movie theater.  It seems like Seagal is no longer trying to hide his weight from the camera, which is a good thing.  He looked ridiculous when he tried covering it up, might as well go with it.  A great Seagal moment comes when he asks a dying man if he'd like to be buried or cremated.  The guy wants to be buried, but when he dies, Seagal shoves him in a hearse, blows it up and says, ""Now you're cremated, Mo$#@&%$&ker!""
Pistol Whipped is the typical Seagal actioner, and it does have a few good moments here and there, but it's not one of the more memorable ones.  Urban Justice was actually more fun.",1208649600,,2776,4.423228346456693
3067223,4,B0011IR2SS,"Why was the title of this film Pistol Whipped? Is it because you feel like you were repetedly hit in the head with a heavy metal object when you are through watching the movie? Maybe. It certainly didn't have a lot to do with the movie itself. It could have been called Pistol Snatched because Segal did his move where he grabs a gun that's pointed directly at him and disables it. So, at this point, the use of a gun in a Segal movie means nothing. It actually is more advantageous to not be armed. Sure, right. This is the same film in which Segal-who seriously looks like a panda bear at this point-hooks up with a smoking hot chick and has an even smoking hotter ex-wife. The point is that you have to know going in that this movie makes no sense. Absolutely none whatsoever; so don't try to figure it out or you'll end up cross-eyed with a blistering headache. Just sit back and bask in Segal's warm, glowing warming glow.

Segal stars as Matt(no last name given at all how great is that?) who is a degenerate gambler who never won. He's also a fall down drunk who has ballooned to roughly 415 since his days as a rouge cop. See, Segal used to play rouge cops, now he's playing washed-up rouge cops. Just like he used to be a movie star, now he's a washed-up movie star. So, our main character spends his days drinking cheap whiskey right from the bottle and eating Manwich straight from the can. Frankly, Sid was not sure if this part of the film was scripted or if they just shot a day at Segal's house. Then the thought dawned on us: if it wasn't scripted, Segal wouldn't have had clothes on.

Stealing a page straight from the Death Wish 3 playbook, Segal was offered to have a favor done for him if he killed someone. So, in order to have his gambling debts wiped off the books, Segal had to kill the coach from He Got Game, who was playing a mafioso. He also set the all-time record for saying ""honest to God"" 328 times in his only scene in the film which lasted like 6 minutes. Good times. Obviously Segal kills him, but this time he did it fashionably. Segal meets up with the coach at a restaraunt, and clearly couldn't just take out the mobster without taking out his henchmen too. One of those henchmen got a fork through the hand. That's right, Death Ring style, baby! That's like an instant 3 stars anytime someone reminds Sid of the legendary Denton Vachs. Now the people who agreed to pay Matt the panda's debt don't let up and force Segal to kill more poeple. Shocker!

They want Segal to kill his ex-wife's new husband who is a cop. Supposedly, the guy is dirty, but we don't see that. We only see that he's great with Segal's daughter, including the touching scene when Segal can't spend the day with his daughter and the step-father berates Segal for being too drunk to hang out with the girl...again. Hilarious even if it wasn't the case (Segal was being forced to go on a hit assignment that day). But, then we see the stepdad kill the priest(don't ask, it's not important just know that stepdad is a baaad man). And, the movie wraps up with a showdown at the priest's funeral. It was Segal vs. the stapdad. Sid must say, this was one of the better shootouts in recent memory. Of course, Segal won. The cool part about the ending was Segal asked Stepdad, ""Do you want to be buried or cremated?"" before he killed him to which Stepdad answered, ""Buried."" Then, Segal blows him up and says, ""You're cremated now, m'f'er!"" Awesome!

We, Sid the Elf, know that it may seem like we were very negative about Pistol Whipped. No, it is not true. Pistol Whipped was the special kind of movie that the more things sucked about it, the better it was. If you know Sid, you understand. Anyway, this was completely due to the genius that is Steven Segal. The man stared in and produced this beauty. This saved the film because if Segal wasn't in charge of himself, he couldn't have talked like his illegitamate brother, Biggie Smalls, for the entire movie. He would have been ordered to redo his lines so you wouldn't have to turn subtitles on to watch the movie. He wouldn't have saved the production all that money on lights because any shot of Segal with his face in proper light would have made any viewer vomit. He didn't have to lose weight, as no other producer alive would have allowed him to be filmed boated and waddeling around the set. Like we said, we loved Pistol Whipped. It's the cinematic equivilent of drinking heavily. You're confused throughout, you might not remember much, you may well vomit, and afterwards you feel hungover. But, did you enjoy the experience? Absolutely. Would you do it again? For sure. So, on the word of us, Sid the Elf, get a fifth of Pistol Whipped and turn it up. It always goes down smooth.",1207526400,9,4749,4.417808219178082

3067225,1,B0011IR2SS,"Pistol Whipped is typical Steven Seagal straight-to-DVD fodder. It has its moments, including a surprisingly suspenseful car chase and a cemetery shootout, but more often than not what it sets out to accomplish it fails miserably at.

Matt (Steven Seagal) is an out-of-work, out-of-luck ex-cop who struggles to keep his weekly visits with his young daughter, and battles constant drinking and gambling problems. A mysterious gray-haired man dubbed Blue (Lance Henriksen) buys up Matt's bookie tickets and gambling debts and propositions him to become a hitman. Being randomly delivered envelopes with cash and a photo, he scouts around town locating his targets. Most are lowlife criminal scumbags who deserve a quick demise, but when Matt is ordered to execute the stepfather of his daughter and longtime friend Lieutenant Steve Shacter (Mark Wilson) he investigates Blue and his motives to discover who the real criminals are.

A slow-motion, chaotic gunfight in a cemetery, desaturated, black and white and blanketed with operatic music opens Pistol Whipped, promising a ridiculous story and moronic characters. It delivers. Steven ""direct-to-DVD"" Seagal once again portrays a general scumbag anti-hero who remains so emotionless and degenerate (save for a couple of choice scenes with his way-too-forgiving, completely un-rebellious daughter) that there really is no point in siding with him. Whether he lives or dies hardly matters because his influence on every other character in the story is basically negative. A burned-out, rundown, jobless gambler, drinker, ex-cop accused of stealing, divorcee and now murderer, we know he's the good guy only because of his name being first on the billing. His actions in the film certainly don't back it up.

From raising a gun, dropping an envelope, opening a door, to drinking coffee, far too many actions are accompanied by grossly overdramatic music, as if to define each trivial task as important. Some are even basked in glorious slow-motion. To make it worse, everything is unusually dark, as if to say that none of these characters can ever emerge from their filthy and detestable lives. Technically, only one scene rises above wretched, and that's the car chase sequence which showcases a few notable stunts and some genuine yet brief action. Seagal has gotten so out-of-shape and dare I say fat, that even his fist-fighting scenes are toned down, slow and only involving his arms. He practically has to stand still to fight, and if it wasn't for the agile gangsters constantly throwing themselves in his 1-foot attack radius, there wouldn't be any punching at all.

Trying to be sneaky with its storyline and failing miserably, Pistol Whipped unleashes an impossible amount of ammo without ever reloading, which correlates to tons of situations being presented without any idea of relevancy or meaningfulness. ""You aren't getting out of this alive,"" blurts a gun-toting enemy. ""Y'know something? I wasn't planning on it,"" replies Seagal. Neither are we.

3067226,5,B0011IR2SS,"Steven Segal has done it again. Made an action packed movie full of drama, humor, suspense, romance, and a strong, yet vulnerable woman named Drea Smalls, played beautifully by Renee Elise Goldsberry. Ms. Goldsberry's
portrayal of Andrea(Drea)Smalls gives credence to the reality of the statement ""Behind Every Strong Man Is an Even Stronger Woman.""

In a lead role opposite Steven Segal, Ms Goldsberry brought beauty, vitality, and spontaneity to her character Drea Smalls. The chemistry between Segal and Goldsberry was natural and edgy. Congratulations to Steven, Renee, and the entire cast of Pistol Whipped for a memorable performance. I enjoyed this movie.

Each time there is some disappointment, in Pistol Whipped it is the start and the end where Seagal in slow motion crosses a line of gunfire, turns and fires apistol without looking and without being hit. There is certainly a lot of mirth in the movies.

3067230,5,B0011IR2SS,"Pistol Whipped (aka Marker) is a good continued effort by Steven Seagal to making good direct to DVD action releases. Most of his direct releases have not been as good as his earlier films. The problem mostly being that Seagal was not doing his own fight scenes (obvious body doubles) and not doing all his voice work. Urban Justice was a return to form for Seagal by delivering on the action front and doing his fight scenes and vocal dubbing. Pistol Whipped is, in my opinion, more of what we want from Seagal. While not having a high budget to work with, this movie still contains the action you will want from a Seagal film. Here's a brief breakdown of the plot. Matt (Steven Seagal) is an ex-cop who is a compulsive gambler and battles with alcoholism. Matt is divorced and has a daughter whom, though he loves her very much, isn't always there for her. He reaches the million dollar mark with his debts and accepts jobs from the ""old man"" (Lance Henriksen) who bought Matt's debts in exchange for some assassination work. Needless to say some things get complicated and lines are crossed. The fight scenes are well staged and it is all Seagal during the fights. No stunt doubles. There are occasionaly stand-ins for certain scenes such as long shots of Seagal's charactor walking down the street or a rooftop shot, but nothing that detracts from the story or action. You have to be looking for it to notice it as it's not very distracting. There is also no dubbing of Seagal's voice in this movie as there was in past releases. Overall, this is a good acion flick harking back towards the days of Marked For Death and Hard To Kill. I give this movie 5 stars by way of what it is. It is a Seagal action flick, and as such, it is enjoyable. This is not a 5 star film in the way Departed or Wizard Of Oz is. If you like Seagal films or liked Urban Justice, I suggest giving it a try.

3301657,2,B0011IR2SS,"With Pistol Whipped, Seagal has made an effort to make two good DTV's in a row with Urban Justice being the previous release, but he generally fails. Pistol Whipped is more of a thriller than an action film and as such is a little slow to get going. It also has the strongest cast that Seagal has worked with for some time. The unfortunate thing about this is that it glaringly shows up Seagal's inability as an actor.

When Seagal has confrontational dialogue or is in a scene with another actor that could lead to a physical confrontation, Seagal lights up the screen with the confidence he exudes as a martial arts expert which made him a star in his early films, he is truly believable as someone who could snap your neck in 2 seconds. When he has normal character dialogue to deliver in Pistol Whipped, it is flat, unemotional and boring to listen to. Seagal makes no choices as an actor as to how to convey any emotion in his lines, there is no life in his performance during these scenes.  No one watches Seagal films for the acting but it is disappointing to have to watch someone do a job and see the look of complete disinterest in their face.

Seagal again beds a very young woman in Pistol Whipped and there is also some of the ego massaging dialogue that appears in many of these DTV's spoken to Seagal. I'm surprised the actress delivering the lines could keep a straight face, this occurs at a breakfast table after a night of supposedly hot passion with Seagal's character.

Overall, one positive thing that director Roel Reine has done is to pull the camera back during the choreographed fight scenes. There are several quick fight scenes throughout the movie and one longer choreographed fight in a bowling alley against multiple opponents that looked impressive considering the budget and time constrains of shooting choreographed scenes such as these in DTV's. The action set pieces are well staged and look professional, the car chase although of a higher quality and with more energy than the car chase in Urban Justice is still rather dull and again the rear projection scenes with Seagal supposedly driving the car during the chase scene are obviously just that, rear projected. The final shoot-out taking up the last 15 to 20 minutes of the film has Seagal as part of a 3 person team rather than a one man army as they go to the graveyard to take down the villain.

As for body doubles, I noticed only one scene with an obvious body double and that was a wide shot of Seagal's character walking on a roof top of a building to the exit door. Another possible body double shot occurs in the beginning with Seagal's character walking up some interior hotel lobby stairs. There is also an appearance by a body double during the shoot-out just before the car chase but it's not that noticable unless you are really making a point of looking for it. Other than that it looked to be all Seagal to me. Pistol Whipped also looks much more expensive than its budget which would be down to the cinematography and is probably the best looking DTV that Seagal as been in. If Seagal has any sense he should make a point of continuing to work with both directors Don LaFaunt and Reol Reine in the future.

To non Seagal fans who have a passing interest in seeing what Seagal is up to, I'd say it might be worth a rental. For hardcore Seagal fans, this is an above average Seagal outing.",1201478400,18,3396,4.531810766721044

A benefactor (Lance Henriksen)buys his ""markers"" and allows the disgraced gambler to ""work off"" his debt by assassinating various bad guys. Standard Seagal fare here,lots of shooting,car chases,and of course Steven beats up hundreds of guys along the way.

3301709,3,B0011IR2SS,"Steven Seagal is back again.  The man's direct to video output in recent years, has been quite remarkable.  This time he is Matt Conlin, an ex-cop with a huge gambling problem.  His markers totaling over a million (yeah right), are bought up by a shadowy figure identified only as the 'old man' (Lance Hendrikson), who proposes that Conlin work off his substantial debt, by acting as a hit man.

With his back against the wall, Conlin acquiesces, and begins receiving his assignments from Blue (Paul Calderon), who works for the old man.  After a couple of very untidy hits, Conlin faces a crisis.  His next target is Lt. Steve Shacter (Mark Elliot Wilson), a cop, a friend, and husband of his ex-wife.

This is an atypical role for Seagal, who usually plays characters that are independent, and motivated by some moral code.  Money rarely is a consideration.  Things are different here, where much seems to be about money.  Conlin's family figures in the mix, but his priorities appear to be clear, when he cancels a visit with his daughter, so he can go out and kill someone.  Troubled by the turn his life is taking (is that a surprise?), Conlin consults his priest (Bernie McInerney), but can there really be absolution for a contract killer?

As you might expect, the level of violence is high, with the hits being very up-close and personal.  Seagal has a couple of minor fights, but most of the action is gun related, with one big shootout in the street escalating to car chase.  The film's finale is a wild shootout in a cemetery, with plenty of flying bodies, and exploding headstones.  Conlin takes out a ton of cops, and barbecues a good friend, but somehow escapes doing any time.

There's plenty of over the top action, though no one is actually pistol whipped, in this quite twisted film.  There is little that is admirable about Conlin, who apparently reconciles with his family, but continues working as a hit man, getting his assignments to kill, while praying in the same church where his priest breathed his last, because of him.  It really seems to be all about the money, as Conlin pulls the For Sale sign from his lawn.

3301714,2,B0011IR2SS,"""Pistol Whipped"" is one of the better films of Steven Seagal in recent years. It is far better than ""Flight of Fury"" and ""Attack Force,"" two dismally terrible flicks that can kill anyone's career instantly. Somehow Seagal has survived them and come back with ""Urban Justice,"" which is certainly an improvement over the previous ones. And now ""Pistol Whipped"" arrives, which is not a bad film, thanks largely to the capable supports and nice stunts, but still is not as good as his earlier films made back in the 90s.

The biggest problem is Steven Seagal himself, or the character he plays. ""Pistol Whipped"" is about Matt, a compulsory gambler who, despite his down-and-out life, still loves his daughter. Seagal plays this anti-heroic protagonist, who is also a disgraced elite cop and now perpetually drunk, but he simply does not look like the man he is supposed to play.

But when action scenes start, things get better. There is a nice car chase and a shoot-out in the cemetery. However, you have to wait for these actions very long. As to Seagal himself, martial arts action scenes are only slightly better than choppily-edited ones seen in his previous flicks, but are still disappointingly brief and few in number.

Probably the film's greatest merit is its supporting actors: Lance Henriksen and Paul Calderon. Lance Henriksen appears as a mysterious man who hires Seagal's character as assassin. His charismatic presence is intact, but he spends most of his screen time (which is too short) doing nothing particularly impressive. Paul Calderon, who almost became Jules in ""Pulp Fiction"" (but the role eventually went to Samuel L. Jackson), fares better as an enigmatic henchman ""Blue."" You can see this underrated actor is in fact as talented as Samuel L. Jackson. Perhaps the film could have been better with them as the leads with Seagal as support.",1222473600,,1861,4.958333333333333
3301715,1,B0011IR2SS,"Alright, first of all He always wears a jacket.  Is it because he is 50 lbs overweight?  Seriously the whole movie, people wearing shorts and tee shirts and mister Wayne Newton, with fake, slicked back hair and crazy fake spray on dark A tan, is walking around wearing a jacket the whole damn movie.

OK, enough of the petty stuff (but seriously more will come later), this movie has absolutely no plot.  He can shoot the tip off of a match, but when it comes to a target the size of what should be an out of work actor he misses constantly, and in a very boring, but consistently boring way.  You know the scene in the Matrix 2 where Keanu beats a bunch of agents with a parking meter for 45 min.?  The way it made you want to go to the Warner Brother Studio with a parking meter of your own an 45 min to spare?  THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS LIKE THAT.  It just kept going, and going.

Every time an expensive car is shown in the movie get ready for the director's attempt to get his foot in the door of the car commercial industry.  It was to the point that it COMPLETELY detracted from what should, but probably couldn't ever be an actual movie.  The director knew that at best he could shoot a car commercial, which is probably how he ended up with Segal, at a Hyundai dealership, hatching up this whole movie as a genius scheme to get a sweet Santa Fe for free.  So, so very insane, and transparent.  Tisk, tisk Segal.

Last and least was the conversation between the girl at the bar and Segal.  I don't know how else to put it, but the manner of speech changed drastically when he was around this African-American woman.  If my mind was not entirely consumed with other obvious and constant flaws in the movie, it might have the capacity to be offended by this.  On a completely different note, what the hell is the deal with his contact with Blue?  Is he supposed to be Jamaican?  He sounds undeniably Jamaican in exactly two scenes, but in all the rest of the scenes, just sounds like a regular bad actor that is not unsuccessfully attempting a Jamaican accent.

For the love of God, don't watch this movie.  If someone recommends it, punch them in the face or at the least the face of their groin, then just empty a large bag of skittles over the victim on the floor (the guy that just got groined), trust me it really, REALLY confuses people.",1220572800,,2343,4.30365296803653
3301716,4,B0011IR2SS,"Unlike his fellow action heroes Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal never got to work with John Woo, but his opportune teaming with director Roel Reine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2/dp/B0046BI81W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2</a>) brought the Buddhist Bonecrusher about as close to ""heroic bloodshed"" subgenre as he's going to get in one of the best DTV titles he'd ever release... Okay, the comparison to Woo is a matter of opinion, but the mere fact that a Steven Seagal movie can still feel inspired is noteworthy. ""Pistol Whipped"" is a stellar follow-up to his previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;and simply one of the most unique Seagal flicks you're ever going to see. Sure, it's still just a Steven Seagal movie, but at long last, it's one that can actually be used to attract new fans.

The story: ex-policeman Matt Conlin (Seagal) lost his job and family to the vices of gambling and alcohol when he's approached by the agent of a mysterious, gentlemanly ""Old Man"" looking to put his lethal talents to use (Lance Henriksen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00000ILDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>). Matt finds new purpose in life as a hitman attacking the city's criminal underbelly, but finds himself at odds with honor and duty when his family is dragged into the mix.

""Pistol Whipped"" was written by J.D. Zeik, the pen behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin/dp/B000ERU9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin</a>, and when interpreted by director Reine's able hand, the script makes for the most complex and dramatically intense outing that the usually one-note Seagal has ever been on. For one thing, it's a decently complex story of double-crosses and fragile relationships, but unlike manure like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>&nbsp;which simply confused you in the process of trying to appear smart, this one is surprisingly streamlined - keeping you in suspense but not causing any headaches. Additionally, the mere fact that Seagal's not playing an invincible superman but an individual afflicted by worldly ills is an elephantine step forward for Steven. Dramatically, it's clear that he's on uneven footing, but he still gives one of the more layered and sophisticated performances of his career. This isn't saying much, so it's a good thing that he's got the likes of Renee Goldsberry (""One Life to Live"") as his love interest, Paul Calderon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Castle/dp/B004BGJXIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Castle</a>) as the Old Man's enigmatic enforcer, and B-movie god Lance Henriksen to support him, creating one of the most capable ensembles you'll ever see in his movies. Even relatively unknown names like Lydia Jordan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kidnapped/dp/B000N3T0EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kidnapped</a>) as Matt's neglected young daughter and Mark Wilson as her two-faced stepfather do significantly good jobs, to the point that you can almost forget you're watching a Steven Seagal movie and can just think of it as its own capable action-thriller.

I could go on about the film's dramatic strengths, but of equal importance is the film's action content. In an interview, director Reine mentioned how he wanted the halt the embarrassing trend of modern Seagal action scenes relying heavily on stunt doubles and stand-ins, and I'm happy to say that, for the first time in a long while, Seagal is looking back on-form with his younger self. There aren't as many fight scenes as many of Steven's other pictures, but they all look pretty painful and feature long, uninterrupted shots to show that it really is Steven doing his own fighting. There's also a pretty decent car chase in there with a couple good crashes. The gunfights fluctuate between old hat and classy, with the finale in the graveyard being a complete triumph of style.

Occasionally, the writing does bear a loose end or two (e.g. who sent the assassins after Matt in the beginning?) and the film's visual style is clearly limited by its budget. Because of this, there is a chance that viewers who turn down Seagal's DTV fare simply for being DTV won't be as blown away by this as I was, but I like to think that true fans will be impressed and delighted by how far our hero came with this picture. It's safe to say that Steven's never done a movie quite like this one, and for that reason alone, it should be worth a buy. Go for it.",1218067200,2,4884,5.9629101283880175
3301717,5,B0011IR2SS,"Another great movie recommended by Sid the Elf!

Have been a fan of Steven Segal since he's been kicking but in the late 80's as slick Italian cop with attitude. This more recent movie takes a different direction with Segal's trademark attitude, and it surprisingly works.

First thing I noticed about this movie is that Segal looks awful! Looks like he's been in a real bad accident and had tons of reconstructive surgery on his face. But alas, this imitation of Elvis' famous I-Just-Died-On-The-Toilet bloated look is just time catching up with the actor. That and the frizzy hairpiece he's now wearing.

The movie itself is classic Segal: snapping arms, blurring punches, and a scowl that still scares. His most famous--if not most used line--of `Let me ask you something,"" is used more than 20 times in this movie. Count for yourself and see. We are also blessed with the guy most unlikely to bed a girl, as Segal snatches a girl from a bar. Putting on more than 50 pounds since his slimmer days, this gives us ""average Joe's"" hope for an unlikely future. And we also see Segal's tender side--a great change from the wife-beater we all know--as he tries to be a good father to his daughter, despite being a degenerate gambler who owes too many people too much money.

I was highly impressed with this movie, learning once again to trust Sid the Elf and their many reviews. Always a skeptic, I like to see for myself. Glad I did. Segal still has it, bloated-with-hairpiece or not!",1209254400,10,1483,4.670498084291188

He's also divorced and not spending much quality time with his daughter(but he proves he'll kick your behind if you get in the way of his weekly visitation).  One day he gets a proposition from Lance Henriksen, a powerful underworld type figure who goes by the name ""Old Man"".  Old Man has paid Seagal's gambling debts and now employs Seagal to basically be a hitman in order to pay him back.  The target is a guy doing under-the-table deals with North Korea and everybody attached to him.  When Seagal's buddy(and stepfather of his daughter) ends up on the list, he decides he wants to get out of the whole thing.  Turns out though that his buddy really is a schmuck and that Seagal might just be working for the good guys after all.
It seemed early in the film that this might have been an attempt to do something different with Seagal.  Making him into kind of a loser character could have been a nice change, but as soon as we're shown his vices they almost immediately fade out of the picture, and he goes back to just being ol' Slabface Seagal again.  Kind of a waste.  Plus, the movie suffers from the same irritating crap that plagues mainstream action films.  By this I mean those pointless moments where the camera has to speed up or zoom in real fast(usually accompanied by a loud ""Whoooosh"" sound) while Seagal is doing something terribly exciting like walking down a flight of stairs.  And if you were a director who had access to Lance Henriksen, why would you use him in only like 2 or 3 short scenes?  Henriksen can't help but be the coolest guy on the planet regardless of the film he's in.  Why not use him more?  I suppose they only had Lance for one day(or more like one hour) since his very few brief scenes are all in the same movie theater.  It seems like Seagal is no longer trying to hide his weight from the camera, which is a good thing.  He looked ridiculous when he tried covering it up, might as well go with it.  A great Seagal moment comes when he asks a dying man if he'd like to be buried or cremated.  The guy wants to be buried, but when he dies, Seagal shoves him in a hearse, blows it up and says, ""Now you're cremated, Mo$#@&%$&ker!""
Pistol Whipped is the typical Seagal actioner, and it does have a few good moments here and there, but it's not one of the more memorable ones.  Urban Justice was actually more fun.",1208649600,,2776,4.423228346456693
3301720,4,B0011IR2SS,"Why was the title of this film Pistol Whipped? Is it because you feel like you were repetedly hit in the head with a heavy metal object when you are through watching the movie? Maybe. It certainly didn't have a lot to do with the movie itself. It could have been called Pistol Snatched because Segal did his move where he grabs a gun that's pointed directly at him and disables it. So, at this point, the use of a gun in a Segal movie means nothing. It actually is more advantageous to not be armed. Sure, right. This is the same film in which Segal-who seriously looks like a panda bear at this point-hooks up with a smoking hot chick and has an even smoking hotter ex-wife. The point is that you have to know going in that this movie makes no sense. Absolutely none whatsoever; so don't try to figure it out or you'll end up cross-eyed with a blistering headache. Just sit back and bask in Segal's warm, glowing warming glow.

Segal stars as Matt(no last name given at all how great is that?) who is a degenerate gambler who never won. He's also a fall down drunk who has ballooned to roughly 415 since his days as a rouge cop. See, Segal used to play rouge cops, now he's playing washed-up rouge cops. Just like he used to be a movie star, now he's a washed-up movie star. So, our main character spends his days drinking cheap whiskey right from the bottle and eating Manwich straight from the can. Frankly, Sid was not sure if this part of the film was scripted or if they just shot a day at Segal's house. Then the thought dawned on us: if it wasn't scripted, Segal wouldn't have had clothes on.

Stealing a page straight from the Death Wish 3 playbook, Segal was offered to have a favor done for him if he killed someone. So, in order to have his gambling debts wiped off the books, Segal had to kill the coach from He Got Game, who was playing a mafioso. He also set the all-time record for saying ""honest to God"" 328 times in his only scene in the film which lasted like 6 minutes. Good times. Obviously Segal kills him, but this time he did it fashionably. Segal meets up with the coach at a restaraunt, and clearly couldn't just take out the mobster without taking out his henchmen too. One of those henchmen got a fork through the hand. That's right, Death Ring style, baby! That's like an instant 3 stars anytime someone reminds Sid of the legendary Denton Vachs. Now the people who agreed to pay Matt the panda's debt don't let up and force Segal to kill more poeple. Shocker!

They want Segal to kill his ex-wife's new husband who is a cop. Supposedly, the guy is dirty, but we don't see that. We only see that he's great with Segal's daughter, including the touching scene when Segal can't spend the day with his daughter and the step-father berates Segal for being too drunk to hang out with the girl...again. Hilarious even if it wasn't the case (Segal was being forced to go on a hit assignment that day). But, then we see the stepdad kill the priest(don't ask, it's not important just know that stepdad is a baaad man). And, the movie wraps up with a showdown at the priest's funeral. It was Segal vs. the stapdad. Sid must say, this was one of the better shootouts in recent memory. Of course, Segal won. The cool part about the ending was Segal asked Stepdad, ""Do you want to be buried or cremated?"" before he killed him to which Stepdad answered, ""Buried."" Then, Segal blows him up and says, ""You're cremated now, m'f'er!"" Awesome!

We, Sid the Elf, know that it may seem like we were very negative about Pistol Whipped. No, it is not true. Pistol Whipped was the special kind of movie that the more things sucked about it, the better it was. If you know Sid, you understand. Anyway, this was completely due to the genius that is Steven Segal. The man stared in and produced this beauty. This saved the film because if Segal wasn't in charge of himself, he couldn't have talked like his illegitamate brother, Biggie Smalls, for the entire movie. He would have been ordered to redo his lines so you wouldn't have to turn subtitles on to watch the movie. He wouldn't have saved the production all that money on lights because any shot of Segal with his face in proper light would have made any viewer vomit. He didn't have to lose weight, as no other producer alive would have allowed him to be filmed boated and waddeling around the set. Like we said, we loved Pistol Whipped. It's the cinematic equivilent of drinking heavily. You're confused throughout, you might not remember much, you may well vomit, and afterwards you feel hungover. But, did you enjoy the experience? Absolutely. Would you do it again? For sure. So, on the word of us, Sid the Elf, get a fifth of Pistol Whipped and turn it up. It always goes down smooth.",1207526400,9,4749,4.417808219178082

3301722,1,B0011IR2SS,"Pistol Whipped is typical Steven Seagal straight-to-DVD fodder. It has its moments, including a surprisingly suspenseful car chase and a cemetery shootout, but more often than not what it sets out to accomplish it fails miserably at.

Matt (Steven Seagal) is an out-of-work, out-of-luck ex-cop who struggles to keep his weekly visits with his young daughter, and battles constant drinking and gambling problems. A mysterious gray-haired man dubbed Blue (Lance Henriksen) buys up Matt's bookie tickets and gambling debts and propositions him to become a hitman. Being randomly delivered envelopes with cash and a photo, he scouts around town locating his targets. Most are lowlife criminal scumbags who deserve a quick demise, but when Matt is ordered to execute the stepfather of his daughter and longtime friend Lieutenant Steve Shacter (Mark Wilson) he investigates Blue and his motives to discover who the real criminals are.

A slow-motion, chaotic gunfight in a cemetery, desaturated, black and white and blanketed with operatic music opens Pistol Whipped, promising a ridiculous story and moronic characters. It delivers. Steven ""direct-to-DVD"" Seagal once again portrays a general scumbag anti-hero who remains so emotionless and degenerate (save for a couple of choice scenes with his way-too-forgiving, completely un-rebellious daughter) that there really is no point in siding with him. Whether he lives or dies hardly matters because his influence on every other character in the story is basically negative. A burned-out, rundown, jobless gambler, drinker, ex-cop accused of stealing, divorcee and now murderer, we know he's the good guy only because of his name being first on the billing. His actions in the film certainly don't back it up.

From raising a gun, dropping an envelope, opening a door, to drinking coffee, far too many actions are accompanied by grossly overdramatic music, as if to define each trivial task as important. Some are even basked in glorious slow-motion. To make it worse, everything is unusually dark, as if to say that none of these characters can ever emerge from their filthy and detestable lives. Technically, only one scene rises above wretched, and that's the car chase sequence which showcases a few notable stunts and some genuine yet brief action. Seagal has gotten so out-of-shape and dare I say fat, that even his fist-fighting scenes are toned down, slow and only involving his arms. He practically has to stand still to fight, and if it wasn't for the agile gangsters constantly throwing themselves in his 1-foot attack radius, there wouldn't be any punching at all.

Trying to be sneaky with its storyline and failing miserably, Pistol Whipped unleashes an impossible amount of ammo without ever reloading, which correlates to tons of situations being presented without any idea of relevancy or meaningfulness. ""You aren't getting out of this alive,"" blurts a gun-toting enemy. ""Y'know something? I wasn't planning on it,"" replies Seagal. Neither are we.

3301723,5,B0011IR2SS,"Steven Segal has done it again. Made an action packed movie full of drama, humor, suspense, romance, and a strong, yet vulnerable woman named Drea Smalls, played beautifully by Renee Elise Goldsberry. Ms. Goldsberry's
portrayal of Andrea(Drea)Smalls gives credence to the reality of the statement ""Behind Every Strong Man Is an Even Stronger Woman.""

In a lead role opposite Steven Segal, Ms Goldsberry brought beauty, vitality, and spontaneity to her character Drea Smalls. The chemistry between Segal and Goldsberry was natural and edgy. Congratulations to Steven, Renee, and the entire cast of Pistol Whipped for a memorable performance. I enjoyed this movie. I only wished this movie had made it to the theater first to be viewed by a wider audience before going straight to DVD. This is a Segal classic to be enjoyed and added to your film library.

Each time there is some disappointment, in Pistol Whipped it is the start and the end where Seagal in slow motion crosses a line of gunfire, turns and fires apistol without looking and without being hit. There is certainly a lot of mirth in the movies.

The sad thing is that I really need to come to terms with the fact that his best days are behind him, as are his best movies, and it is time to find a meaner, leaner martial arts fighter-actor.

3301727,5,B0011IR2SS,"Pistol Whipped (aka Marker) is a good continued effort by Steven Seagal to making good direct to DVD action releases. Most of his direct releases have not been as good as his earlier films. The problem mostly being that Seagal was not doing his own fight scenes (obvious body doubles) and not doing all his voice work. Urban Justice was a return to form for Seagal by delivering on the action front and doing his fight scenes and vocal dubbing. Pistol Whipped is, in my opinion, more of what we want from Seagal. While not having a high budget to work with, this movie still contains the action you will want from a Seagal film. Here's a brief breakdown of the plot. Matt (Steven Seagal) is an ex-cop who is a compulsive gambler and battles with alcoholism. Matt is divorced and has a daughter whom, though he loves her very much, isn't always there for her. He reaches the million dollar mark with his debts and accepts jobs from the ""old man"" (Lance Henriksen) who bought Matt's debts in exchange for some assassination work. Needless to say some things get complicated and lines are crossed. The fight scenes are well staged and it is all Seagal during the fights. No stunt doubles. There are occasionaly stand-ins for certain scenes such as long shots of Seagal's charactor walking down the street or a rooftop shot, but nothing that detracts from the story or action. You have to be looking for it to notice it as it's not very distracting. There is also no dubbing of Seagal's voice in this movie as there was in past releases. Overall, this is a good acion flick harking back towards the days of Marked For Death and Hard To Kill. I give this movie 5 stars by way of what it is. It is a Seagal action flick, and as such, it is enjoyable. This is not a 5 star film in the way Departed or Wizard Of Oz is. If you like Seagal films or liked Urban Justice, I suggest giving it a try.
