8506418,4,B006YEQ88O,"I returned this for a refund. It is not an instructional DVD. It is a rather beautiful demonstration of the forms, but there is no instruction, and it is filmed from too great a distance to clearly show the how-to of the forms. If you want instruction, this will probably disappoint you. If you want a demonstration to practice with, this is probably a good one.",1454716800,4,362,4.5
8506419,5,B006YEQ88O,"I have depended upon this DVD to make progress in learning Tai Chi.  Watching Sifu Jensen in slow motion, in different views allows me to constantly refine what I know and reinforce what I just learned.  He is elegance in motion.",1349654400,4,229,4.560975609756097
8506420,1,B006YEQ88O,"Don't buy this video! Even though the author describes this as some unique version of the Yang Long Form (I was hoping for a unique form that I am currently learning), it turns out that not only is this like every other version of the Yang 108/88 available on the web, the performance isn't that good, the quality of the video is poor (hardly qualifies as SD), and there's no commentary or anything. Probably taken by a friend with a VHS video camera on the Marin Headlands on a sunny day. Nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge, if that's appealing.

And if you buy this as a download, you can't get a refund or anything. You're just out the $40.

Save your money.",1347667200,,662,4.330645161290323
8506421,5,B006YEQ88O,"Sifu Jensen is an incredibly talented Tai Chi master and teacher. His detailed, thoughtful teaching style comes across very well in this DVD - the sequences are shown from different angles and project Scott Jensen's talents beautifully. This is Tai Chi at a very high, wonderful level. I am lucky enough to be his current student in San Anselmo. The music and scenery are lovely - subtle musical background and backdrops of the Golden Gate Bridge and woods in San Francisco. Sifu Jensen's sophisticated presentation of the entire Yang Style Tai Chi Long Form is unique. His intelligence and deep knowledge of the human body and energetics are evident. I highly recommend this DVD, and, if you live close by, his classes.",1343692800,4,720,4.909836065573771
8506422,5,B006YEQ88O,"Sifu Jensen demonstrates the original traditional Yang Style Tai Chi Long Form on this DVD.  He does it slowly with detail and much elegance and grace.  The DVD is beautifully done with the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge once showing the whole form.  Then in a forest setting, he breaks up the form into short segments, repeating some movements with views from a different angle.  Each move is listed in the segment.  Watching Sifu Scott perform inspires you to learn this ancient chinese martial art/exercise that gives many health benefits.",1343520000,3,546,4.956043956043956
8506423,5,B006YEQ88O,"Sifu Scott Jensen is the real deal and this dvd is a true gift to the Tai Chi community.  Not all can be as lucky as I to have studied with Sifu Jensen directly, but here is your chance to get the authentic Yang style long form demonstrated with great grace, a deep root, and abundant qi that comes from a lifetime of practice.  Enjoy!",1326931200,4,335,4.138461538461539
