Get the fix of the Erlkel!",1427241600,,58,4.181818181818182
4174618,4,B003R0MEPY,"I have this 5th season of Family Matters on the DVD set, and it's good season. I also have the first four seasons and seasons 6-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets, and their also good seasons to watch. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or get the 9th season to watch on the DVD set. Family Matters is still my all-time favorite show and one of the best shows I've ever seen though, but the first eight seasons is what I'll just stick with watching, including this 5th season. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway, and I do like Jaleel White as the main character of the whole show playing (Steve Urkel). And not only do I like Jaleel White on the show, but I also like all the other characters. This 5th season of Family Matters even has the very first episode with Steve turning into Stephan, and that episode is ""Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool"". That episode right there is definitely an episode I would never want to forget with Jaleel White, because it shows his true character with him playing (Stephan Urquelle).

I happened to see and notice that the cover artwork and the DVD discs of this 5th season looks bootleg, and it doesn't look like new or original copies just like the first four seasons. But that doesn't bother me, because all I care about is watching the show itself. And the DVD discs shows pretty clear with the show and episodes running.

And from this 5th season of Family Matters, my favorite episode is ""It Didn't Happen Over Night"", an episode where Laura oversleeps and misses her bus to go to Cinsenatti for a cheerleading competition, and Steve decides to drive and take her there in his Isetta. And then they both stay in a motel room overnight during a thunderstorm, and things don't go too well between them. But at the very end, they end up making up by Steve telling Laura about how she ruined her vacation trip by him helping her. And I do like how Steve stood up to Laura by explaining the problem. I remember a couple of times on Friday nights I watched that episode from the TGIF show line-up, and it became my favorite episode, especially with seeing Steve drive a car.

Another one of my favorite episodes from this 5th season is ""Aunt Oona"", an episode with Donna Summer playing Steve's aunt. That episode even shows Donna Summer as (Oona) becoming real good friends with Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette), and they both talk and get to know each other. Jo Marie Payton is one of my favorite characters on Family Matters, and I like how she became real good friends with Donna Summer in that episode. The last scene from that episode even shows Donna Summer as (Oona) singing one of her hit songs up on stage at a karaoke contest, and it showed her looking pretty. Oona then wins the $1000 dollars after singing at the karaoke contest, and I find that she had such a wonderful voice to sing just like what Steve said in the episode. And from the 8th season of Family Matters, there's another episode like that with Donna Summer playing Steve's aunt Oona, and that episode is ""Pound Foolish"". That episode from the 8th season also shows Donna Summer as (Oona) and Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) being real good friends, and that's also one of my favorite episodes from the 8th season. It's also known that Donna Summer passed away on 5/12/2012, and both episodes even brings back memories of her being on the show, playing Steve's aunt Oona and being a singer. Donna Summer was also a singer in real life just like on the show, so even as a singer she should be remembered as.

Another episode from this 5th season is ""A Camping We Will Go"". And every time I watch that episode, it lets me know that Reginald Veljohnson was not very nice and always had a bad attitude around Steve, and he was not the (Carl) like from the first four seasons or from the earlier episodes. The first season of Family Matters is one of the seasons I think about with Reginald Veljohnson, because that's really the season he was pretty much nicer in, and he was a different person. But that episode ""A Camping We Will Go"" from this 5th season does not show Reginald Veljohnson being that (Carl), and I really didn't like what a bad attitude he had around Steve. I think Reginald Veljohnson could have acted better than the way he acted in that episode, because I'm used to seeing him act nicer on the show most of the time, playing (Carl). But I still don't mind watching that episode though, because it's still a good episode and this whole 5th season of Family Matters is a good season for me to watch. That episode ""A Camping We Will Go"" from this 5th season only had Steve, Eddie, Carl, and Waldo in it. And the last three episodes from this 5th season after that episode ""A Camping We Will Go"" and the rest of the episodes from seasons 6-8 that I do like shows Reginald Veljohnson playing more nicer characters as (Carl), which is an even better thing.

This show Family Matters even came out with seven Christmas episodes from the 2nd season, and from seasons 4-9. And this 5th season has the 3rd Christmas episode ""Christmas Is Where The Heart Is"". And that's a Christmas episode where Steve and Carl gets stuck on a train during a blackout after going Christmas shopping, and things get better afterwards. I do like the Christmas episodes of Family Matters, and they do bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show. But the Christmas episode from the 9th season is what I would do without watching, because again I don't like the 9th season of Family Matters, and I wouldn't buy or get it to watch for a simple reason.

The regular episodes from this 5th season of Family Matters are also pretty good episodes to watch with good memories, and I would never want to forget them.",1427155200,15,5871,4.461824953445065

4174672,5,B003R0MEPY,"I don't understand the few negative reviews. This is a 90s show. There was no HD and of course it will have a little grain to it. Sure I wonder why the rest of them weren't released like the first 4, but i'm just glad to have them to own...PHYSICALLY instead of this streaming crap. Anyway, this is a great season. We get Steve's alter ego Stefan, and see a bit of a change in the show. We all know Judy was written off, and Aunt Rachel is MIA, though Richie pops in and out a few times oddly. The focus does shift more to Steve/Stefan, but hey, it's awesome because it's funny. The kind of humor lost in an abyss of ""reality"" tv.",1484956800,,630,4.088709677419355

4174754,2,B003R0MEPY,"A very poorly made copy of an excellent series. For whatever reason, they have decided to let Amazon burn the fifth season as people order it, instead of professionally making and selling it. The first set I received wouldn't play on any of our DVD players. The replacement sort of plays. It will freeze of and on and stops by itself. The picture quality is like the knockoff movies you buy in NYC. But this is the only way to own the fifth season so far, so I guess that it's better this than nothing. What I don't understand is why the quality is so bad. You can buy it digitally from Amazon, so why can't they make a great copy on DVD??",1461369600,10,639,4.203252032520325

We see Steve in a wrestling ring, playing basketball with a 7 foot grandma, and at the dentist. Meanwhile Eddie Winslow (Carl and Harriette's son) gets harassed by two alleged racists white cops and a sports gambling bookie named Bones. Notable guest stars in season 5 include Former NBA All Star Larry Johnson Singers Shanice and the late Donna Summer as Urkel's aunt Oona and Legendary WWE Hall Of Fame Tag Team the Bushwhackers (Luke Williams and Butch Miller)

______________________________________________________________
Twenty years later, WE are still talkin' 'bout this show--- for VARIOUS reasons.
Oddly enough, it started about a family: Carl; Harriette; children: Eddie; Laura;
and Judy... but after ""killing off"" Judy---who, later, became an adult film star[in
real life]---became a series about Urkel and Laura and/or Myra. It worked.
MUSIC became an important part of the series, and will probably increase the
PRI$E of the seasons with, ever-increasing, famous guest-stars [singing their hits].
""Rachel"" was busy, elsewhere, filming most of the TRANCERS 1-6 sci-fi flicks.
Off topic---but about MUSIC copyrights; and my living all over the world---I had never
even SEE ""The Drew Carey Show"" until THIS WEEK, when I obtained [from a friend]
the complete series which will NEVER see its way to DVD b-e-c-a-u-s-e of the expense
of all the great music in THAT show.
I look forward to seasons:
6
7
8
9

SUPPORT THIS SHOW!
""Sergeant Carl Winslow"" was in Die Hard and Die Harder... and is ALMOST as old as me.
He'll be 64, this year. Will you still love him, will you still need him WHEN he's 64? I vote:
YES!",1455840000,2,2486,6.423880597014925

4174812,5,B003R0MEPY,"FINALLY!!!! I've been waiting forever for this season to be released. As a kid, this was one of my favorite shows. This is my favorite season of the show because it has funnier episodes and also introduces Steve Urkel's alter-ego, Stefan Urquelle. I REALLY hope that the other seasons get released.",1455494400,4,298,4.862745098039215

4174840,5,B003R0MEPY,"I've  always  liked  Steve  Urkel  (Jaleel  White).  He  maybe  goofy  &  he  maybe  funny  &  annoying  &  Clumsy,  not  to  mention  an  inventor  who  comes  over  just  about  every  evening  to  demonstrate  his  latest  inventions  to  carl  (Reginald Vel Johnson).  I  got  to  say  they  work  fine  for  a  few  minutes,  then  right  when  Carl's  just  getting  satisfied  &  impressed  with  them  they  actually  end  up  failing.  But  despite  all  the  mishaps  that  happen  between  him  &  the  Winslow's  he  always  gets  right  to  the  more  important  matters.  &  Eventually  Laura (Kelly Shanygne Williams)  &  Eddie  (Darius  Mac Crary)  usually  end  up  forgiving  him.  In  this  fifth  Season  you'll  witness  Carl  acting  like  a  nerd  after  mother  Winslow  tried  suggesting  to  him  to  get  some  reading  glasses.  &  Steve's  newest  &  latest  invention  the  transformation  machine,  which  uses  his  liquid  that  makes  him  cool  &  turns  him  into  Stefan Urquel  who  Laura  has  got  the  hot's  for.  But  when  a  friend  of  the  families  is  injured  Stefan  doesn't  seem  to  have  any  feelings  about  the  accident.  Nothing  except  romance,  &  Laura  finds  herself  asking  him  to  turn  back  into  Steve.  If  there's  anyone  in  the  gang  who  knows  how  to  prove  a  point  to  someone  better  than  anybody  its  got  to  be  Steve!  Then  there's  Myra  (Michelle Thomas)  Who  cannot  resist  Steve!  Yet  Steve  stays  after  Laura.  Steve  doesn't  know  it.  But  I  think  him  &  Myra  have  got  more  in  common.  Myra  is  funny  in  her  own  way.  At  least  I  think  she  is, &  appears  to  be  quite  different  then  most  girls.  Last  but  not  least  is  Waldo  (Shawn Harrison),  &  Eddies  best  friend.
Season  5  is  worth  the  watch.  Yet  still  I  wait  for  it  to  come  out  on  DVD.  Nothing's  happening  yet!  But  I'm  hopeful!
I  use  to  watch  every  season  almost.  &  I  realize  Warner Brothers  is  a  very  busy  company,  I  hope  one  day  they  get  around  to  releasing  it.",1441670400,,2102,4.493865030674846
