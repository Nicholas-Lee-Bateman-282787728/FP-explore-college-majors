It is an older one and it looks old but at the same time it is a good one. Lonnie and John were both good, the story holds your attention. There is a lot going on. John looked very good. I have watched him over the years, like his acting and have bought many of his movies since I learned that he passed this summer.

This is rare so buy it will it is still available here on Amazon only.",1520294400,,481,3.948453608247423
