8032864,3,B0002VEW88,"Outside of DTV enthusiasts and hardcore fans, most of Gary Daniels' movies qualify as obscure. ""Witness to a Kill"" is fairly unknown even among the Danger Man's faithful, not in the least because of how well the generic DVD cover and indistinguishable cast blend in among the low-budget mass. While a viewing does reveal some unique touches, the movie isn't worth hunting down to all but the most enthusiastic Daniels fan.

The story: On a mission to deliver vital dispatches to an embassy in Africa, a special forces operative (Daniels) is caught up in a terrorist operation headed by a sadistic rebel (Nick Boraine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sails/dp/B00W6669U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sails</a>).

Unbeknownst to most folks, this is actually the first (or second?) part in a short-lived franchise for Daniels that also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-s-Messenger/dp/B001HT66CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen's Messenger</a>. Herein, Gary's character demonstrates strong James Bond overtones, but the disappointing screenplay helps make for a movie that in no way presents a threat to the genuine 007 series. While there are some nice touches in the form of surprising competency from the protagonist's team, there is no intrigue here at all and none of the characters are written memorably. It particularly peeves me that the screenplay seemingly goes out of its way to disempower its two major female characters - denying Eva Habermann (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx/dp/B00IN3PU74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx</a>) an obvious opportunity to resolve the conflict an hour ahead of Daniels and giving action veteran Francoise Yip (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>) not even a single fight scene.

Speaking of fights, the film marks another collaboration between Daniels and the Alpha Stunts crew, and as usual, what they deliver is pretty nice but there's not nearly enough of it. There are only three fights of substance, plus some shootouts, and while Gary suffers from a lack recognizable opponents, the stuntmen he takes on nevertheless contribute to some modestly exciting brawls, complete with overblown flips and falls. Despite these highlights, the sections of the film that are comparatively lite on action tend to drag, with only a plethora of accents to keep you otherwise entertained.

""Witness to a Kill"" precedes the first time since his career got rolling that Daniels took a substantial break from filmmaking. After this three-year hiatus, Gary played more and more supporting roles in other people's vehicles or ensemble pieces, so in a way, this (along with the two other flicks he made in 2001) can be considered a final installment in the golden age of Daniels' occupation as an action hero. He does not seem tired at all, but perhaps the reduced focus on substantial butt-kicking indicates otherwise.",1438646400,2,3106,6.133333333333334
8032865,4,B0002VEW88,"i like gary daniels and have most of his movies.  some are not yet on dvd.  my favorites are fist of the north star and rage.  this one has all the action that i like.  if you are a fan, you must have this one added to your collection",1326585600,,234,3.7142857142857144
8032866,1,B0002VEW88,"Ok, where to start....this is one of those action movies you know before u rent that it will be bad, but your curious to see just HOW BAD it could be. I hate these movies where the action scenes are so spread out between completely useless plot and worthless character development. Noone cares about how the damsel in distress feels about their past relationship, just get on with some action please! Having to endure painfull acting scenes between Gary and Franoise Yip is more than enough torure.

other than a few martial arts scenes, this is a gun fight movie. Gary shines as usual. The ending where Gary chases Wolfe on foot through warehouse catwalks while Wolfe is on a motorcycle and Gary somehow manages to tackel him mid-air, um...yeah right. Also the grenade scene where Gary pushes Eva Habermann to safety while the grenade is 2 feet away, the explosion suddenly becomes 20 feet away...um okay.",1124841600,3,906,4.770700636942675
8032867,2,B0002VEW88,"Gary Daniels is one of those former kick boxing champion whose buff physique and boyishly good looks have enabled him to star in several straight to video movies.  Daniels tries hard, but with his cockney accent and poor scripts hampering him, he's yet to really become a true ""star"".  In this attempt to project Daniels into a kind of James Bond role, the movie falls flat due to its slow pacing in the beginning and an unimpressive supporting cast.  Nick Boraine as the cunning villain does well, but he isn't on screen a lot until the last fourth of the movie.  While the movie does have a high-tension climactic battle, getting there requires a lot of patience on the viewer's part.  Darrell Roodt's direction shows some promise in an unusual scene in which we get a slow motion view of a gun flying through the air and the actor's reactions to it; it's a neat visual effect--too bad there weren't more in the entire film.",1119571200,2,926,4.587878787878788
