8511672,5,B0077BK87K,"I watched this movie yesterday and it is a brilliant, yet disturbing movie on Honor Killings. I didn't really know that this was far more common than I thought. The story is about the clash of cultures that results in tragedy. A respected professor in an Indian immigrant family feels betrayed when his daughter dates an English boy. The ""honor"" of the family is at stake and the doting father takes matters into his own hands. The film keeps you engaged throughout and is brilliantly directed by Avantika Hari. The acting is top notch with special marks for the father (Narinder Samra) as well as the daughter (Neelam Parmar). A ""must see"" if you are tired of the usual tripe that is being dished out by Bollywood and Hollywood. For full disclosure, Avantika is my niece and I didn't realize till now that she is a master storyteller. This movie has won many awards - here is a short summary from Wikipedia:

8511673,5,B0077BK87K,"From Fox news: On January 29, after a ten-week trial and fifteen hours of deliberations, a Canadian jury returned with a verdict of guilty to first degree murder for Mohammed Shafia, 58, Tooba Yahya, 42 (his second wife), and Hamed, 21, their son. They were found guilty of conspiring to and of having murdered Mohammed's first wife, Rona Mohammed Amir, 50, and Tooba Yahya's three daughters, Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, because they refused to wear hijab, wore Western, sometimes ""sexy"" clothing, dared to have boyfriends, and, in their father's words, ""dishonored"" and ""betrayed"" both ""their family and Islam.""

The short paragraph above is from a news story. I read it by some coincidence just before I saw ""Land Gold Women"". This film, as far as I know is fiction. However, it presents a story of an Indian-English family in just such a situation. The daughter has grown up in England and is a bright girl who wants to go to university. She dresses in jeans, doesn't cover her head, and secretly even has a non-Indian English boyfriend. Her uncle arrives from India with a proposal for an arranged marriage which would take her back to India to become the wife of a man she has never met. When she defies her family and refuses, then runs away to the English boyfriend, the consequences escalate to an climax which no one wants but which no one finds themselves able or willing to stop.

A great strength of this film is that it presents the characters and the situation in which they find themselves in a way that makes them all real, believable, and understandable. We know what happened almost from the very beginning. What the film does is make us understand why it happened, what the people involved thought and felt, and how the traditional views of a father towards his family and culture and the modern western perspective of his daughter created a chasm that even years of western life and a loving family relationship was unable to bridge.

This is one of the best films I have seen this year, perhaps one of the best ever. By the end, I felt like the characters were people I knew. Early in the film, the father and daughter find themselves discussing the play ""Antigone"", another story about a father and daughter where the conflict between the father's authority and perceived responsibilities clashed with what his daughter felt compelled to do, also with tragic consequences.

As I watched this film, my thoughts kept returning to the Fox News story, and I almost felt that I was experiencing the members of that real family demanding from each other agreement to and acceptance of choices which the others found impossible, and with ultimately the same consequences.",1333756800,2,2696,4.791397849462365
8511674,5,B0077BK87K,"This is one of the most important films that I have ever experienced. The ending is given to us in the first few minutes yet the tension is taut throughout. It is so well made that I did not know that this was a low budget film until I read it somewhere online. The scenes and settings are simple, but at no point does it look like someone was cutting corners in order to save money. So back to the ""important"" part: This film takes on the issue of so called ""honor killings"" in Britain, opening up a perspective on an ongoing social tragedy that almost everyone works hard to ignore. This brilliant debut by director and writer Avantika Hari is well made in every way, but there was an element that took this film to the heights of my all time film list. As an American Muslim film geek of Arab descent, I have a particular interest in films about Muslims and Arabs. Islam and Muslims are a tough thing to portray in a film. There is an explanation element that is more or less a necessary component; as well as that simple but seemingly impossible part of just presenting people's perspectives as they are in reality, no spin no judgment. They usually screw up the first part and it just goes downhill from there. In the end, everybody screws up. In my experience Avantika Hari stands alone as the one who didn't. If you have the opportunity to see this rare film, move mountains to do so",1332547200,2,1390,4.370656370656371
