8500324,4,B006LD42BI,"Huge huge huuuuge fan of degradead. This DVD is great, however it only has a few live tracks and some music videos. I don't know maybe I expected more... Like a full concert or songs. I think the main DVD is 30 minutes. The audio isn't spectacular by any means but the DVD is viewable plenty of times because of the great awesome sound degradead produces.",1438473600,,355,4.393939393939394
