8516120,5,B004I2AR18,"I grew up watching Jack Brittingham's videos and DVDs. I used to have a copy of this before but it got ruined and was able to replace it with a new copy. It showed some exciting hunts for 7 big game species. It also has Jack's friend, Richie Bland, on a Brown Bear hunt in Alaska where a huge bear even charged him before put another arrow in that thing! It was very thrilling and scary at the same time! If I go on an Alaskan Brown Bear hunt, hopefully that won't happen to me!",1525392000,,478,4.042105263157895
