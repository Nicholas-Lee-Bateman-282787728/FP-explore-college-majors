8042274,1,B0006Q93MO,"Dominator - The animated movie was nothing like I thought it was going to be. It was very cheapy made. I didn't like it at all. The most it has going for it is the cover I thought was cool. That's the only reason I even considered buying it. Well, water under the bridge.",1369008000,,271,4.037037037037037
8042275,5,B0006Q93MO,"I'm a crazy Dani Filth fan.  He is so charismatic.  Even though it's animated, you can believe he's real. Some hot animated sex scenes. Nail biting action. One you can watch over and over, just not with little kids around. The shipper was fast and cheap.",1354147200,,254,4.5
8042276,5,B0006Q93MO,"Before I even say anything about this movie, let me describe the perspective I'm coming from here.  I'm a big Cradle of Filth fan, so the only reason I even discovered this movie is because Dani Filth voiced the main character (Dominator).  I also only watched this film LONG after it was first released or even culturally relevant...

As for the plot, well, the main character is Dominator, a demon from hell who ends up in our world to stop this other demon who wants to take over hell in place of Lucifer.  He befriends a human woman (complete with what has to be the most hilarious sex scene in the history of all cinematography), shit blows up, stuff happens, and he eventually wins.  That's about it.

As for the visuals...  This is actually the first all-CG film to be released in England (or so I've read) and it really shows.  How to describe these images?  Well, think early Playstation 1 cutscenes and you've got a good idea of what this looks like.  Now, it's easy to mock these visuals with the beautiful CG stuff we've got today, but this was made under a very small budget and it was the first of its kind.  I find it hard to fault it for that.

So, is this film any good?  Well, the first thing anyone would say after seeing this film is that it's not exactly fantastic.  The graphics make your eyes bleed like you've got a stigmata in your retina, and the plot reads like bad fanfiction.  That being said, though, I love this movie!  It's really funny!  Anyone who's familiar with riffing and metal culture would find this movie hilarious.  It's got everything in it that makes the cheesy side of metal great (demons, beer, naked boobies, more demons...).  It's just a great B-movie with great riff-ability to it.  So, if you're interesting in metal culture, Cradle of Filth, or just want a fun movie to laugh at with friends, I'd recommend getting this movie.  It's full of awesome!",1334707200,,1900,4.513196480938417
8042277,5,B0006Q93MO,"Now before you judge this movie I should let you know that it was made on a very low budget and the animation was made using an iMac. It is also Britain's first ever 3D animated feature film, and was quite successful there. Voice acting is very good, Dani Filth plays the tilte role, Doug Bradley voices Dr. Payne and the demonic Lord Desecrater, Ingrid Pitt voices Dominator's ex-lover Lady Violator (who was designed by Yasushi Nirasawa) and Mark & Lard (two British comedians) fit the roles of Decimator & Extricator perfectly. There's lot of hilarity, black humour, action and the best soundtrack you could ever get in a film. Highly suggested for B-Movie and Cradle Of Filth fans, or if you're just looking to have a laugh.",1103760000,3,728,4.6953125
