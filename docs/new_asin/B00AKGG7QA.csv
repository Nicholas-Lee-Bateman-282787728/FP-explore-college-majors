5445280,5,B00AKGG7QA,"my favorite Wuthering Heights by far due to the amazing performance by Ralph Fiennes as Healthcliff. He IS Heathcliff as the book creates him, hard edges and all. He is amazing. Juliette Binoche also portrays KAthy perfectly. This pair of characters are both so horribly twisted that you both feel sorry for them and angry at them. This is exactly as the book makes them. Also, the costumes and art direction are excellent. This is an authentic representation of the era and the book",1442534400,4,483,4.761904761904762

5445286,5,B00AKGG7QA,"Yes, okay, I suppose it falls into the category of Penultimate Chick Flick, but the Binoche and Fiennes do a great job of bringing their characters to life.  The book Wuthering Heights seemed a bit over-the-top to me; but this movie helped tie some themes together.",1419206400,3,265,4.760869565217392
