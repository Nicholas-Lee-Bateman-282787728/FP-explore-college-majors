8026654,5,B0002DFLFE,"A pretty good collection of matches with the exception
of Jesse Ventura/Garea match which was crap to watch.

Demolition vs. Powers of Pain was a good match, more
buildup for Wrestlemania V. It was cool to see Demolition
at the top of their game her doing their thing.

Mr. Perfect vs. Brutus Beefcake was ok , interference
by the then badly Outlaw Ron Bass spoils the victory
for Brutus.

The tour with Sean Mooney as he then covers the outdate
WWF offices was allright. Mooney was a likable
personality.

Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Jake The Snake vs. Andre
""The Giant"" and Ravishing Rick Rude.

The big Coliseum video exclusive, a decent match.
Cool to see Hacksaw vs. Andre one more time and
Jake vs. Rude had always produced some memorable
moments.

Followed by another exclusive and rare footage
of the creation of The Million Dollar Belt
by Ted Dibiase. This is actually well acted
, we even see a rare Brother Love show segment
where it's unveiled.

The last match on the tape is a rare match between
Dibiase and ""The Excellence of Execution"", ""The Best
,There is, The Best there was, and The Best there
ever will be"", Bret Hart.

Man this was Bret at the top of his game as
always this time in single's competition. He
and Dibiase put up a great match.

Overall great tape to own.",1124150400,,1284,4.523809523809524
