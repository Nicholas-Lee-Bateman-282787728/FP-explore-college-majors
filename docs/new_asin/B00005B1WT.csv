These comic actors were popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Children laughed but did not realize the bad examples they set. Would they be allowed on TV today? Is there market for their humor? Moe Howard played in a movie of a Shakespeare play. He did not have the looks of an Olivier or Gable. He earned more and worked steadily in these series. And thats what actors do.

Disorder in the Court, 1936
A lawyer questions a dancer: who killed Kirk Robin? The three main witnesses are out to lunch, but return. Take off your hat. Will something go wrong? Curly testifies. They will re-enact the event. [Can you believe their actions?] Gale dances. The boys show what happened. Is the trigger too hard to pull? Will an unloaded revolver fire? Order in the court. Can they catch the parrot? The note will clear Gale.

Brideless Groom, 1947
Shemp is a Teacher of Voice, we hear his student sing. He learns his uncle died and left him $500,000! [A lot more then.] But only if he is married. Can he get hitched? There is humor in a telephone booth. [Is this still funny today?] Shemp is prettied up. That woman greets Cousin Basil, then rejects him. Shemp finds a woman, they go to the JP for more comic action. Then five women arrive to be the bride. You wouldnt hit a lady with that. Were married. What will Shemp do now?

Malice in the Palace, 1949
Men enter a restaurant. Three waiters serve them, then must clean up the mess. The conspirators will need three men to do their work. Rabbit or hot dogs? Curly chases a cat then a dog! Shemp and Moe sample the meal. Curly enjoys the meal. These three will get the jewels for us. A message arrives, are they too late? We learn more about those two men. They are not what they seem to be. They study that map. [Note the names.] There aint no Santa Claus. Can they get that diamond without any trouble? [Then it wouldnt be funny.] I heard that cats are supposed to taste like rabbits, and dogs taste like pork.

Sing a Song of Six Pants, 1947
The boys have a tailor shop with new and second hand clothes. They get a bill for overdue tailoring equipment. The radio tells of a reward for a robber. Curly gets a spot out of clothes. Moe makes pancakes. Shemp reads the comics. What else can go wrong? A man takes refuge in their shop. 200% Wool. A detective enters to look around and sees nothing. Later that man returns to his flat. Moe finds a paper in those pants. A customer gets brushed off. A woman wants her dress dyed, and buys a jacket and slacks. Three men want their suits cleaned but they want that paper! After some comic conflicts the three robbers are given to that detective for a reward!",1396828800,,2671,4.366197183098592
7936193,1,B00005B1WT,"I used to own a 4 DVD set by the same name, which included the DVD here along with the ""Funniest Moments"" ones.  I was disappointed to discover that none of the material was in its original format (all you get are discs that have some brief clips, a few short documentaries, and plenty of empty space).  Unfortunately, this holds true for most other Three Stooges collections.  The only Three Stooges collection I can recommend (and the only one that is sure not to cause disappointment) is ""The Ultimate Collection,"" which consists of 8 volumes and contains every episode in its original format.",1361750400,,596,4.766990291262136
7936194,2,B00005B1WT,"Another one of Goodtimes Stooge collections, ""Festival"" is just another rip-off disc of material available elsewhere in better form.  Worst of all is the ""GT"" logo which appears throughout.  This series of Stooge DVD's from Goodtimes are worthless.",1357430400,,248,5.5
7936195,1,B00005B1WT,What a disappointment.  If you buy this product thinking you're going see any of the shorts that you remember as a kid you will be disappointed,1135641600,,143,4.5
7936196,1,B00005B1WT,"I was severely disappointed in this 5 set series.  I was hoping to introduce my son to the pleasures of the Three Stooges that I had as a kid, but instead found myself having to cut it off before I soured him on the stooges.  The bulk of the segments have ""Curly Joe"", not ""Curly"" and are from the 60s.  To compound the offense, GoodTimes Video elected to present the collection on EP mode to save a few cents of tape.
In its defense, there are several esoteric clips that the Stoogephile will want in their collection.  But you most certainly will not want to use this to introduce your kids to the stooges.
Personally, I would like to see any manufacturer that sells video on anything but SP mode taken out and shot(or at least given a 2 finger eye-poke).  I was thinking tonight that at least this will be behind us with DVD, but then I realized that they'll just increase the compression ratio to get whatever they want on the disk.",1010448000,7,936,4.35632183908046
7936197,3,B00005B1WT,"There are about 5 Three Stooges shorts from Columbia that are in the public domain that have been released on DVD and VHS in different formats with different titles, but it is mostly the same old stuff. The same holds true with a number of rare items, such as the 1949 TV pilot, some solo Shemp shorts, and other TV guest appearances. Most of these compilations are from Good Times Home Video, as is the Festival title.
Three Stooges Festival is more of the same, but the good news here is that there is also a 4 DVD version under this same title. One of the DVDs is this one. There are two DVDs called Funniest Moments and Funniest Moments II. And one is called The Three Stooges Story.
Funniest Moments are taken from the live action intros the team did for the 1965 series of cartoons called The New 3 Stooges. The box proclaims that this shows the Stooges at the height of their popularity and are a rare glimpse of the team in color. All of that is true, but their peak actually came about 5 or 6 years earlier. The segments aren't very good, the accompanying music is tough to sit through, but the cartoons, which were of varied quality, have been edited out. The best thing is that on volume II, the very last segment is an 8 minute, black and white appearance of a rather amusing routine taken from the Ed Sullivan show. I can't remember if I saw this when it originally aired, but I know there were several appearances on Ed Sullivan, as well as Joey Bishop's late night show and others. If these could be found and released it would certainly be worth it to serious collectors.
The real find of this four pak is the documentary called The Three Stooges Story. It is more than twice as long as the other DVDs in the pak and is chock full of stuff I have never seen before. And it makes good use of snippets from stuff that has been out before.
If you can find this four pak, it is at a good price, only about what one would pay for a regular movie DVD for all four here, and well worth it for the documentary and that Sullivan clip.",995068800,22,2041,4.262886597938144
7936198,4,B00005B1WT,"The Three Stooges look great on DVD!  The new ""technicolor"" imagery provides greater depth and a better viewing experience.  Although, this DVD didn't have my favorite 3 Stooges clips, it was packed full of other hair-raising and ridiculously funny comedy the Stooges were famous for.",991612800,5,284,5.288888888888889
