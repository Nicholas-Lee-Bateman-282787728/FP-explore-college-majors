4333902,5,B004DNXIHM,"Survivor fans have been waiting many years for more seasons to come out on DVD.  Very excited they've released Africa and Marquesas, and I'll definitely be pre-ordering Heroes vs. Villains. Hope that all the seasons in between will be released in time.  They could put out like 2 a year and do very well with it.  Survivor fans are a loyal bunch.  Hoping for Thailand and Amazon next.  And even though some viewers think Thailand wouldn't sell well, yes, it would.  Or just package it as a box set of Amazon/Thailand together.  ALL SEASONS NEED TO BE RELEASED....but if we have to pick and choose, I also hope China and Micronesia make the cut.",1292544000,17,644,4.5964912280701755
4333903,5,B004DNXIHM,As soon as it aired it was one of the most exciting and strategic seasons to date.  I am SOOOOOOOO excited that Survivor is being released on DVD finally :)  This is an outstanding season of the show.  Cant wait to get it! :)  Thanks for releasing :),1292284800,8,250,4.145833333333333
4333904,5,B004DNXIHM,"As other reviewers have said, I was hoping that Thailand and Amazon would be next, but any Survivor is good Survivor. I'll get the DVD's no matter which season. Those two next though please Amazon / CBS!
Heroes vs. Villains, although bogged down by a few problems, is actually one of my favourite seasons. Off the back of Tocantins and Samoa, I didn't think I'd be able to enjoy Survivor much anymore. Despite the return of Russell and the ridiculous amount of idols this season, I actually ended up really enjoying it, although Sandra should've had a much better edit pre-merge, seeing as she's the greatest winner ever (also the greatest two times winner as well did you know?).
On the plus side, giving the show a two hour premiere was a fantastic choice and gave us one of the best first episodes ever in the shows history. It also seems judging by the running time this set will be packed full of bonus footage, which makes this all the more worth the purchase. Keep the Survivor DVD's coming please!

Update- Got my DVD's today (fast delivery considering I live in the UK) and I'm very pleased with them. Great quality and packed with lots of extra bonus features any diehard Survivor fan would be happy with. I am a very happy Survivor fan and I know what I'll be watching over the next few weeks! Now, could we please get Thailand and Amazon?",1291334400,29,1350,4.532786885245901

4333915,2,B004DNXIHM,"I originally bought this when it first came out in 3 parts, 10 discs total. I decided to re-purchase it in the 5-disc version so I could reduce a little clutter on my shelf to make room for future seasons and to have the version with more content on the discs rather than how they originally came. When I received it, I was very disgusted and disappointed. The packaging of the discs came in a single case that held the discs in a stack compared to what I NORMALLY receive with all my other dvd sets which is the case with 5 individual DVD flip trays. Also the information on this version said the discs now are in a dual-layer format rather than the single that they used to be. From examining the discs, I don't think that was accurate as well as the first and the fifth disc had scratches and smudges. I'm very disappointed with this, and I really want this FIXED so I can get it the way that it should be!",1451865600,,909,4.2
4333916,5,B004DNXIHM,"The season, as of writing this review, is still my favorite season of all time.

4333936,5,B004DNXIHM,This season of survivor is up there with the best in my opinion it's one not to forget! It's got everything plus more. It's maybe the best one but it's hard for me to pick a best because I love them all. Some more than others but there's not a bad survivor because all have different people which makes it interesting and some bring back the best of the best. So if you have favourite characters from different seasons than you'll be happy to know there most likely in this survivor. A lot of drama and great game tactics in this season buy it you won't be disappointed it's a must have for any fan.,1398988800,,599,4.217391304347826

p.s. Pearl Islands is even better - even more Sandra.",1395360000,,314,5.137254901960785

4333942,5,B004DNXIHM,"Survivor 20 was a wonderful addition to our collection of available Survivor dvds. Considering who was on this survivor, we weren't sure whether we really wanted to have it, but were very pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. We're looking forward to any future Survivors when they become available.",1385856000,,304,5.1
4333943,5,B004DNXIHM,"'Heroes vs Villains' was a highly impressive season!  Got a chance to watch this season with a friend of mine who's a huge Survivor fan recently and I must say this has to be one of the best competitive and strategic seasons ever put together.  I think casting did a wonderful job picking the right villains and heroes for this season who could bring the drama and gameplay for the fans enjoyment.  Every episode was intense and loads of entertainment.  There wasn't even one player I truly hated throughout the season, not even Russell Hantz.

Just a quick insight into the final 3: Parvati makes a fantastic, jaw dropping game play mid way into the season against a fan favorite and past winner not to mention she's a competition beast!  Sandra plays a good game, despite not winning any individuals immunity challenges and being a whether grey area contestant though being on the villains tribe.  Russell, though he is viewed as one as the most evil players in the history of this show, played quite the strategic minded game from start to finish.

I don't know if Jeff Probst would ever do this kind of season again, but I sure wouldn't mind.  I would say, if you never seen Survivor you might want to check out few seasons with the popular players featured in this.  If not you should be fine to watch because it's tons of fun!",1384819200,2,1332,4.5588235294117645
4333944,5,B004DNXIHM,"Great 5-disc set for Survivor 20: Heroes vs. Villains. Special features include cast interviews and bonus footage. The DVD could have had more bonus content but Season 20 saw some insane game twists and comes highly recommended. Russell Hantz continued to dominate. Some epic moments with Boston Rob, Coach, Rupert and many other all-stars.

Buy this DVD. It has held its value very well.",1376956800,,388,5.0625
4333945,5,B004DNXIHM,This season is filled with just about all of your favorite survivors and takes many unexpected twists and turns.  I couldn't stop watching it to the point where it affected my sleep.  i stayed up late to watch until I got to the end.  They should do this type of survivor again.,1368403200,,278,4.3076923076923075

4333947,5,B004DNXIHM,"This is one of the best, if not the best season of Survivor.  Parvati, Boston Rob, Russell...I could go on and on.  All that was missing was Hatch (who I think was in prison at the time).",1365465600,,187,4.027027027027027

4333956,5,B004DNXIHM,"If you are wondering why anyone would buy a season of a reality TV show that you watched live -- and thus know the outcome -- well, I wondered that myself, too. But I remembered really enjoying ""Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains"" when it aired, and the instant video price ($19.99) was pretty inviting. The final kicker was that I was looking for something to load on my Kindle Fire so that I could watch TV while running on a treadmill.

And ""Heroes vs. Villains"" has been everything I remembered -- great characters, great scenery, great twists and turns. Interestingly, while I remember the general arc (there are major arcs in the Heroes and Villains tribes before the merge, and then a third arc post-merge), it turns out that I don't actually remember that much about the order of booting. In some instances, I did recall that a player had progressed far, so when an early episode suggested that that player was at risk, I knew something would happen. Still, it has been vastly entertaining.

It's also a great show for watching while running. It doesn't demand a tremendous amount of concentration, and a good deal of it is some kind of competitive athletics, so it tends to inspire my running.

The picture quality on my Kindle Fire is generally good, but there's a surprising amount of unintentional pixelation (that is, not driven by CBS censors). It could be due to my having a first generation Kindle Fire and not an HD.",1357171200,,1428,4.681274900398407

4333961,5,B004DNXIHM,"This season was really good. Lots going on. Pretty fun, interesting people. That guy Russell is particularly fun to watch. And of course, so is Boston Rob. It was fun to see a lot of the old characters from the previous seasons and seeing what they would do differently or the same. If you haven't seen some of the older seasons, be warned that the previous winners are mentioned in some of the episodes. So,if you haven't seen this one yet and are considering buying it,I would do it. As far as it being fake packaging and made ""on-demand,"" you shouldn't worry. I was thinking this would come in some black generic case and look all F'd up, but it came in a fancy standard box set like regular DVD's. It had all the regular ""Survivor"" art and looks like all of the regularly released Survivor seasons.

It used to be fun to hear what the person who got kicked off thought about everyone.  It was so much better than the 4 Survivors who talk over each other telling you about the show on the other dvd's.  We wish they would produce all of the old shows, it was fun watching it again especially seeing Rob.  Gave it 5 stars.  It was worth the money.",1314662400,,459,4.27906976744186

Some of them played with no problem while others skipped and froze. I contacted support about the problem and they sent a replacement saying it must have slipped through the cracks. Replacement came same problems. I also bought two other seasons of survivor that were Manufactured on Demand and had the same results. Don't waste your money on this. Hopefully CBS will release good copies in the near future.",1309478400,,572,4.509615384615385

I am a huge fan and it was great to see players that I have watched over the last 10 years to come back and play.

This was the perfect time to do a season like this, since it was the shows 20th season (10th year). We got to see a nice collection (some undeserving) of returning Heroes and Villians.

This season was packed full of exciting moments, great challenges, and even a few dumb moves tossed in for good measure.

Was glad to see it released on DVD, I will gladly buy all seasons that are released.",1307923200,,580,4.254545454545455

I ordered this about 2 weeks ago and received it very quickly. i watched the episodes and everything went along smoothly, until i got to disc 6. Both episodes on the disc would not play and kept skipping. this is a brand new dvd and should have no reason to be defective. This same exact thing happened to me in december with season 3, africa. In march i ordered survivor season 4, marquesas. and guess what.....THE SAME THING HAPPENED. the second time this happend i thought it was just that i recieved the few out of hundreds that were defective. but seems to me these are poorly made. this frustrates me a lot! returned my order to amazon and they sent me a new one that actually did work. please be aware of this when ordering. make sure you are able to return an item if you need to.

4333972,5,B004DNXIHM,"If you're a fan of Survivor, then this is a must have!  If you were thinking about starting watching Survivor, and want to get caught up and know what the show is about, then this is a must have.  If you see this season first, then you really won't know who are the Villains and who the Heros are, and why, but that doesn't matter. I can promise you'll get hooked.

Some of the Heros are ones we liked, and played the game as honestly as they could You have Colby.  In the past Colby seemed like a nice guy, but in this season, he was such a grump and a grouch.  It was funny to see him this way.  J.T trusted the wrong people, and did a bone headed move in his season, that cost him, and cost him dearly. In this go around, he's the same nice guy. There are a lot of heros, kind of to many to get into.

For the Villains, we have Boston Rob, Jerry, Russell, and others we love to root against. The thing is that Russell is called ""devious"" and a ""villain"". Maybe so, but he's the smartest player that the game has ever seen. He pulls off some amazing blind sides.

The challenges are some of the most physical and brutal that any of the seasons has to offer. In more than one, someone is hurt, and in some cases, hurt pretty bad.

This season has some amazing blind sides. I mean, so amazing, that they're classics.  You don't know who to trust, even people in the different alliances have trouble trusting each other.  Many times, the course of the games is changed by both tribes, it's so neat to watch.

If you're a fan of the show, then you need to have this. If you're thinking of buying it to see what the show is about, then this is a must have. I can promise that you won't be sorry.",1305849600,,1692,4.093939393939394

4333975,5,B004DNXIHM,"Im very happy to finally have this dvd set in my collection.  One thing I will say before viewing this title, I encourage fans to watch Survivor Samoa before this season to be able to truly enjoy it.  I wish they would put all the seasons out on the market and not make us wait so long.  The dvd though cheaply packaged in regular dvd cases, is remarkable in its video quality and is presented in widescreen, the special features are great too, including extended post tribal council interviews with the newly voted off castaway..now to the season itself!

  This season marked the endpoint of a very strong run of seasons of Survivor. Now with Nicaragua and the currently airing Redemption Island it just seems that the groups they select for seasons are just boring people. But this season, along with the previous 4, gave us very memorable characters. Starting with Micronesia- Fans Vs Faves, and goin to Gabon, followed by Tocantins, and then Samoa..Heroes vs Villains had a lot to live up to.  And ya know what, it does! Filmed in August-September 2009, Probst and company gathered 20 of the most memorable people to ever play the game of the Survivor.  2 tribes- 10 former contestants were labeled as HEROES- known for their acts of integrity and resisting the dark side...and 10 Villains- known for their acts of deception and cut throat attitude to win the game at all costs.  The 10 Heroes- Amanda, James, Cirie, JT, Tom, Rupert, Colby, Candice, Stephanie, and Sugar.  The 10 Villains- Boston Rob, Tyson, Sandra, Courtney, Jerri, Randy, Danielle, Parvati, Benajamin ""Coach"" Wade, and Russell.  A few questionable selections plague both teams including Danielle even bein on the show at all, same goes for Candice, and Cirie...who really should have been a villain after what she pulled back in Micronesia.  But for the most part they got it right.  Richard Hatch would have made it on here, but his trouble with the IRS prevented him from doing so.

From the very first episode, 15 minutes in...you know its goin to be an all out brawl for the season as 1 castaway gets a dislocated shoulder and another breaks a toe..all in the very first challenge!  It is moments like these that make this season great...every episode has something major that goes down.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION! ***
One of the main threads this season is the Boston Rob vs Russell feud.  Both are polarizing figures...you either hate them or love them.  I like Rob, but Im a diehard Russell fan.  For anyone who watched Samoa, you know Russell would play the same way he did the first season, making deals with everyone and making bold moves in trying to get to the end.  And why should he have played any differently, he participated in Samoa and made it to the top 3, not sure if he had won that game or not.  He turns right back around 3 weeks later and competes as a member of the Villains tribe.  CBS decided they had too much of a goldmine in Russell, after seeing what he had done in Samoa, so they decided to shoot seasons 19 and 20 back to back.  Both were filmed before Samoa (19) premiered in September so they did not know how Russell played the game.  But they should ve known better...here is a guy they don't know...and hes been described as one of the Top5 most notorious players to ever play...so they did it to themselves.  This feud between Rob and Russell is the highlight of the season -""if ya aint with me, you against me""

Whle Russell commands much of the spotlight, other cast members get screen time and rightfully so is Coach.  Making it to the top 5 in Tocantins was impressive, but Coach is known for his legendary stories of sailing, and canoe trips and being captured by natives.  Love him or loathe him, he is quite fascinating.  And he comes into this game with a chip on his shoulder with something to prove.  He enters this game in a heck of a lot better shape this time around and it pays off.

This season is marked by 2 huge moves...1 winning the award for the Dumbest move ever and 1 that I thought should have gotten the honor actually (Tyson, lol).  But as I stated before, this really is a companion piece to Samoa.  It's the same location for both seasons, features probally the most polarizing figure the game has ever had in Russell.  If you are a fan of this series, I strongly recommend buying this set...whether you missed its broadcast, or bought it for replay value like I did, you will not be disappointed!

AS Coach would say, ""Pray for the Merge"".  Well I say ""Pray for more seasons to be released"" haha!",1303344000,,4560,4.565805658056581

4333984,5,B004DNXIHM,"Summary
Pros:
+One of the best, most memorable seasons of Survivor in the show's 22-season run
+Lots of great extras
+10 discs and optimal DVD video quality for a TV show of this nature (16:9 widescreen)
+High-quality discs
+Well-designed sleeves
+Effective menus

Cons:
-Smaller printing on the backs of the DVD cases is too light and hard (but not impossible) to read
-No cardboard sleeve to contain the 3 DVD cases

EDIT 5/29/11:
Based on a question I got, I need to update my review to note that there ARE closed captions for the episodes. Most of the extras did not seem to have them, or I was unable to get them to work otherwise, but the show itself is captioned.

Overall Recommendation:
+Definite BUY for: (a) Survivor fans, (b) people who watched Survivor during its earlier seasons and would like to see some of their favorite players return, and (c) anyone curious about Survivor who hasn't really watched the show much but would like to experience a good season of it
-Definite SKIP for anyone disinterested in Survivor, reality TV, etc.

Review:
Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains is one of the most memorable seasons of Survivor in the show's history. In stark contrast to most seasons, this group of veterans were all about the game from day 1. Tons of twists and turns occurred during this season, including possibly the single stupidest move (and probably most game-changing) any survivor has ever made.

Others have reviewed the season, however, so I want to focus on this DVD set. In fact, I'm writing this review specifically because this is the first Amazon Manufactured on Demand (MOD) product I ever bought, and I doubt it will be the last. This is a 10-disc set. Each disc has 2 episodes (or the time equivalent thereof), and there are extras on every disc, ranging from extended exit interviews to the Surviving Survivor special. The first disc is mostly bonus features and setup stuff. The remaining discs contain the episodes. While these are on DVD-Rs according to the Amazon listing, they do not look like DVD-Rs; they have the clear mirror-like back (as opposed to green, purple, or whatever other color tint commercial DVD-Rs have). The discs are all nicely labeled and look largely indistinguishable from other non-MOD seasons' discs.

The 10 discs are stored in 3 cases, two 4-disc cases and one 2-disc case. These are standard cases available at most office supply stores, but I have no complaints here. Actually, I like this better than DVDs stored in those ridiculous ""Eco-cases"" that have holes punched in them to cut down on plastic. Whereas those can lead to the insert becoming punctured or otherwise damaged, these cases protect it well. On the topic of the insert, each one is printed on standard DVD-sleeve paper. The cover and spine of each disc is identical except for the part number. The back contains an episode list with original airdates. The only complaint with the sleeve is that the printing for the little grid on the bottom of the back is too light, so it's hard to read. This does not matter much, of course, and the only reason I even bring it up is because it is one of only 2 flaws I've noticed.

The second flaw is one that is not unexpected, but somewhat of a shame. Commercially available, non-MOD seasons of Survivor had nice cardboard boxes to store the DVDs on a shelf. The 3 cases are all standalone products, except for the obvious numbering and the fact that on parts 1 and 2, the UPC on the back is replaced by ""1 of 3"" and ""2 of 3."" A cardboard box to keep these in would have been nice, but its absence is hardly enough to warrant lowering the overall score.

Finally, a note on the DVDs themselves. When you put these in your DVD player, the normal DVD piracy warning and CBS logo appear, then it gets right to the menus. The menus have nice shots of tropical areas, presumably the locations for filming. No menu audio is present. Everything is simple, clean, and easily navigable, which is exactly what one expects from a DVD menu. Spot checking some of the episodes indicates that they look mildly better than they did when they aired on TV. The picture is clean and all of the colors are wonderful. The audio mix is also enjoyable for this show, showing off the talent of the post production team.

I'm primarily writing this review for those who, like me, never bought an Amazon MOD DVD set before, but really wanted this season of Survivor on DVD. I thought MOD products would be slightly better than bootlegs people sell on eBay; I was never expecting this. To those of you unsure about the MOD products, I can wholeheartedly say that it's a very good investment. This set is as good or better than many other in-store TV on DVD sets. It is professionally made, and the minor issues discussed above generally do not detract from its overall quality. On a 100-point scale, I'd probably give it a 98/100 to account for the things that are missing. Still, this set has plenty of extras, is well-made, and contains one of the best and most memorable seasons of Survivor in the show's history. It is a great buy and is strongly recommended to Survivor fans and to those who may have watched the show during its earlier seasons, but stopped at some point during its run. Buy this set.",1298592000,21,5252,4.644779332615716
4333985,4,B004DNXIHM,"I think this is probably one of the better seasons of Survivor. The cast features the most-loved and most-hated players of all time, and though I don't agree with a few of the inclusions, and would have like to see a few other players instead, overall it's a very strong cast. The first episode is possibly the best first-episode ever, with two injuries at the first challenge, they get down and dirty right away. There are lots of suprise votes and blindsides, and possibly the most idiotic move in Survivor history. And also, nothing against the show, but the dvds come in three seperate cases with no slip case, which to me, is an annoyance.",1298419200,,644,4.608695652173913

4333987,5,B004DNXIHM,"I've said it before and I will say it again, I am a huge survivor fan. Any Survivor season is worth a purchase, but seeing as the review is for season 20 let me tell you briefly about it.  This season had a great two hour opener to re-aquaint us with Survivors we had met before (some as early as season two).  With such a bunch of experienced players in this season of the game it comes to an all new level.  Highlights include the ""letter"" and ""present"" sent to Russell from an opponent on another team (a caculated but backfired move), the stunning handover at tribal council of two immunity idols by a player also in danger (caculated and clever move) and a tough player passing out stating ""the game almost got the better of me"".  This is a season played by a bunch of people that LOVE this game.  Its worth getting.  I will take this moment to plea with any of those in charge (as I always do) to continue the release of the Survior seasons so fans can own them all. We need seasons five and seven next.",1295654400,,1009,4.229166666666667

The fact that Thailand and Amazon were not released before this one is a little disappointing, but I am comfident that Amazon will release them all eventually if we, the fans, buy the ones out now.  Africa and Marquesas were great, and very well done with good bonus features.  The only criticism I have to offer is that the sets were sold as 3 individual DVD cases without the box that holds the DVDs in all of the TV Series DVD boxed sets that I have bought.
