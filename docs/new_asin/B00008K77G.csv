7985044,4,B00008K77G,I love Marines corp. This is talking about combat. I guess it is ok.  I gave three or four stars.,1386288000,,97,3.85
7985045,1,B00008K77G,Painful to watch and a waste of time. I had to bug out of the film early it was that bad. I have seen better acting at a junior high school drama club. Keep you money and sped some time in a worthwhile pursuit.,1382918400,,210,3.7954545454545454
7985046,4,B00008K77G,"Marines is a film that deals with a U.S. Marines unit sent to the Caucasus (with Moscow's approval) to apprehend a major Russian crime baron by the name of Antonov. Following a failed attempt in Sarajevo, which turned into a fiasco, U.S. Marines are sent to Chechnya to rendezvous with Russian forces in order to bring in a crime lord whose illegal activities have made him a very wealthy and wanted man.
The movie with its horrible acting and its terrible dialogues falls into the B-movie category hands down. Having said that it is action packed and quite graphic which in turn makes up for its shortcomings. Curiously, at times, it seems as though one can hear noises reminiscent of the original Battlestar Galactica series (whenever the Cylons were around) as if someone inserted them for some unknown reason. In a nutshell, far from even thinking about purchasing this movie, you mind find it amusing if you're in a mood for blood and guts and/or are heavily intoxicated.

7985047,4,B00008K77G,"This is a very entertaining movie. It goes right into the action and shooting and doesn't stop. This is 90 minutes full of death, blood, explosions, swearing, suspense, a suicide, a rape, and surprising twists in the end.
But why not 5 stars? The action is so non-stop, that the movie could get confusing at times. They don't really clarify what is really happening very well. You kind of just have to figure it out and come up with your own conclusions by yourself. However, this does not distract from the overall enjoyment of the movie very much.
Another downpoint is that they don't develop some of the characters very well. There is a very distinct separation between the main characters and just the extras, so you know who is going to die - the characters that don't talk at all during the movie. This leads, I guess, to an apathetic reaction when they die, since the viewer doesn't really 'know' them well enough. The main characters hold up the movie rather well, though, and they have enough interesting things to say that they nearly make up for the lack of character development of the extras. However, I'm not saying that some of the main characters don't die. This movie is, like I said, full of death.
Good movie, overall. Despite some of the flaws, it is very entertaining, so your 90 minutes watching this movie would be well spent.",1077580800,8,1349,4.625
7985048,3,B00008K77G,"This is a typical Mark Roper, fast paced war action flick that keeps you on the edge of yor seat. There's plenty of blood and gore, good Marines and bad Russians. Brant Cottons role as the young Marine leader was dead on. A missed cast black man as the crusty Colonel with a Mike Tyson voice, was the only distraction. All in all a movie worth watching. Semper Fi..",1056585600,9,365,4.304347826086956
