I was looking to find out more about the Mini Bar but this is not the best source for this information. A better choice is Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations Collection 4"" DVD. In the segment on Washington DC, Anthony talks to Jose Andres and has a degustation meal at the Mini Bar with more detail and comments than you will find in this DVD. Also, while the DVD is from the 60 minutes TV program, the segment on Chef Jose Andres is only about 20 minutes long and I felt a bit cheated.",1293926400,,628,4.241666666666666
