5730475,2,B00CMQIDVI,"I received my Season 1 box a couple of days ago and it's great - or at least it could be ...

Picture and sound are very good for a show this old, so it should be 5 stars for every fan of the show.

Sadly, TGG or MGM made a huge mistake on disc 3: Episode 7 ""Sentence of Death"" is missing; instead the disc includes as Epidode 7 ""Elogy for a Hero"", also included as episode 1 on disc 5.

So this 5 star product looses 3 stars due to sloppy production. One can only hope the company will correct their error.

5730476,5,B00CMQIDVI,"While the old 1961-63 television series ""Ripcord"" was not something I've thought very much about in recent years, my interest in it re-surfaced when it became available on DVD. It's been so long ago that I've forgotten the details, but I do know that, as a teenager, I avidly watched the shows when they aired. And I suspect the weekly episodes strongly influenced me to take up the then-new sport of skydiving several years later, a sport I pursued with great enthusiasm until its costs exceeded my starving-college-student budget. Be that as it may, I was really anxious to get my hands on the DVD set so I could once again enjoy the thrilling aerial adventures of skydivers Ted McKeever and Jim Buckley.

I was not disappointed. The ""Ripcord Complete Season 1"" DVD set contains 38 episodes on five disks, each one about 23 minutes or so of glorious full-screen black-and-white classic television. The disks come in two traditional DVD cases, labeled ""Vol. 1"" and ""Vol. 2,"" with three disks in the first case (all mounted on a single spindle from which two had come loose during shipping in my package) and two on separate spindles in the second. A nice-but-superfluous cardboard box holds the cases. It features the same front-cover artwork as the individual cases and a full episode list on the back.

As for the episodes themselves--well, based on the few I've sampled so far, they're great fun to see again after so many years. Yes, they can be corny compared to modern (but not necessarily better) standards. The actors' performances tend to be low-key but competent, given that the real stars of the show are the skydiving stunts, which were filmed as they happened without tricks or special effects. The stories can be a little strained as they try to make the plot point of skydiving fit into unlikely situations. But the episodes are pretty sharp and have excellent contrast, with just a little digital banding in the skies of some scenes. And, thankfully (hurrah!), the dialog is clear, crisp and comprehensible, a relative rarity these days.

If you're a fan of the good old days of television, you can't go wrong with ""Ripcord.""",1375920000,6,2142,4.831062670299728
5730477,5,B00CMQIDVI,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! The only versions of this little gem of a TV Series I ever got to see were from Bootlegs that are circulating out there. The quality of them were horrible, with some of the episodes barely watchable. I look forward to the delivery of this series later this summer. As soon as they arrive, the boot's I have will have an appointment with my little friend, Mr. B.F.Hammer. May they rest in pieces!",1368748800,10,420,4.397435897435898
5730478,5,B00CMQIDVI,"I remember watching this show with my father.  It was a syndicated series and I believe it ran Thursday evenings at 7PM in New York on NBC.  I believe it concerned two investigators or detectives.  The thing that made the show interesting was the it showcased the then new sport of skydiving.  We had never seen anything like this before and I remember watching it breathlessly.
Another thing that was interesting was that it co-starred Ken Curtis, Gunsmoke's Festus Haggen.  After watching him in Gunsmoke, his father-in-law John  Ford's westerns (including the classic The Searchers,) John Wayne's The Alamo, etc., it was nice to watch him in a totally modern role and it will be fun to see him again.  The other star of the series, Larry Pennell, became a character actor on tv and appeared in tons of tv series.
Obviously, I haven't seen this series in about 50 years (although I still have the Dell comic book,) and I am greatly looking forward to seeing it again.",1368748800,16,969,4.6982248520710055
5730479,3,B00CMQIDVI,"RIPCORD was a syndicated TV series in the early 1960s. It was the first ( and so far only?) program to incorporate sport parachuting into the weekly plot. The ripcord being the cable one pulls to open their parachute. Our heroes (Larry..or was that Ken?..Pennell and Ken Curtiss) were instructors at their own school teaching parachuting and the new sport ( then)  of sky diving.  Every week they sound up on a jam or equipment problem, aircraft problem, etc. Or they would be hired to do movie work, of just be out parachuting and get into an emergency situation where their skills were needed.  It looks now like a lot of the parachute jumps were all shot in a few days and then the seasons stories were built around thus filming! The series was a popular enough entry to be renewed for a second year, now in color, when most TV networks were still shooting black and white. Plots were simplistic...but they had to be presented, enacted, and resolved all in 22 minutes, as it was a half hour commercial program....and those were the days when the stars were also expected to do commercials explaining how Chesterfield cigarettes made a more exciting day or what oil to use in the family car, etc. I got both years just for the nostalgia...expect no historical gems or great  award winning acting! Both stars went on in Hollywood to movie and TV appearances. Ken Curtis had long been a feature film western movie actor , sharing the screen with John Wayne on many occasions( ""THE SEARCHERS"", ""THE HORSE SOLDIERS"") He was a singer in the ""Sons of the Pioneers"" in many movies, and later shared the small screen with Jim Arness as "" Festus Hagen"" on ""GUNSMOKE""! You'll see Pennell in the movie ""MIDWAY"" and scores of other TV programs of the 70s through 90s!
  I offer similar comments regarding Volume Two of this series.",1416700800,3,1821,4.6397515527950315

Hunting mobsters, free-lance government agents looking for lost atom bombs, concerned nice guys looking for lost husbands/wives/kids/pets, delivering mining supplies...you name it, no job is too small or too dangerous for these skydiving heroes.

5730496,4,B00CMQIDVI,"This is another series I was hoping for a DVD release (having already devoured HIGHWAY PATROL and SEA HUNT).  I have collected a number of episodes over the years on VHS, and was VERY disappointed to find that this set contacts EDITED episodes.  Many of the episodes I have on VHS run 25 minutes plus -- each of the episodes I've watched so far are 23.5 minutes (or so).  The colour episodes from Season 2 (didn't know it was colour -- my episodes from season 2 are all in b&w) is very muddy -- like watching a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS dub.  As this is probably the best we're going to get -- unless the producers fix the edited episodes and replace the disc with the duplicated title -- this will HAVE to be the box set to get.

RECOMMENDED series but the ultimate presentation was very disappointing.",1386633600,2,803,4.3624161073825505
5730497,5,B00CMQIDVI,"At last Ripcord has made it to DVD!  I have thought about this show for almost 50 years, my only connection was a coloring book that somehow got packed away with some of my childhood books.  Ripcord did for skydiving what Sea Hunt did for scuba diving, this is pure Golden age of television action entertainment.  Ripcord like Sea Hunt was produced by ZIV productions who marketed many great television series for syndication, sold to local television stations and not to the 3 major networks.  Don't expect what you may find in a modern show, but the writers always seemed to pack a good story into about a 25 minute show.  Good always triumphs over evil, you know from the start the bad guys will get caught, the medicine for the sick child will arrive in time, or the elderly man trapped in a snow storm will be rescued, and in the end Ted and Jim argue over who will get the girl. Ripcord centers around two business partners, Ted McKeever (Larry Pennell, alias Dash Riprock from the Beverly Hillbillies) and Jim Buckley (Ken Curtis, alias Festus Hagen from Gun Smoke), two former Army paratroopers who run Ripcord Inc. and make their living from the then little know sport of sky diving, don't ask yourself how two men can own a jump plane, employ a pilot, drive a radio dispatch van and drive magnificent 60's era convertibles and still make a living out of jumping out of airplanes.  There is no computer animation, Ripcord was shot using real sky divers and crude aerial cameras of the time fastened to the cameraman's helmet, in fact during the filming of one episode, two planes used in a camera shot collided and crashed (everyone parachuted to safety) and the footage of the crash was incorporated into several episodes.  Whether they are helping the police track bank robbers, delivering serum to a remote town or jumping into rugged mountains searching for a missing person Ripcord is plain out fun television.  While the stories may seem hokey by todays standards they are a lot better than a lot of what you find on t.v. today. And season one at least shot in glorious black and white.  Highly recommended.",1386115200,2,2122,4.6675603217158175
5730498,5,B00CMQIDVI,"A little dated, but a great series from the 60's. It is written well and great to see Ken Curtis before he became Festus on Gunsmoke.",1384387200,2,133,4.153846153846154
5730499,5,B00CMQIDVI,"I ordered the Ripcord Season 1 and Season 2 as soon as it was available.  The picture and sound quality is excellent on all the episodes.  The entire episode is shown each time along with the opening and closing credits.  It looks like there were no shortcuts with Ripcord.  Each episode begins with a skydiver leaping from a plane and Larry Pennell saying ""This is the most danger packed show on television...""  It really brings back the memories.  Ripcord was a one of a kind series and is still enjoyable today, even if you have never heard of it before.  I highly recommend this DVD set.",1383091200,6,591,4.518867924528302
5730500,1,B00CMQIDVI,"The content of the DVD is great.  I was a professional skydiver for many years, influenced by watching this show in the early 60s.  It's great to see the program again.

Now the bad news, the DVD Is DANGEROUS!  It completely ruined my TV.  The episode selection screen is very dark with the word RIPCORD in big white letters.  I fell asleep watching the disk.  At the end of the episode, the disk reverted to the menu screen.  When I woke of 4 hours later the word RIPCORD was burned permanently into my TV screen.  It is visible in the background of just about every scene displayed by the set.  IF YOU WATCH THIS DISK, STAY AWAKE!",1382486400,5,632,4.3247863247863245
5730501,5,B00CMQIDVI,"I took up the sport of Skydiving (Parachuting) in 1967, based on this non-network TV series.

Larry Pennell and the late Ken ""Festus"" Curtis played Ted McKeever and Jim Buckley, the owners of a Skydiving School and ""Skydivers for Hire"" outfit, usually going ""where no aircraft or vehicle can go,"" to perform rescues or make ""emergency medical deliveries"" to those folks who were isolated.

I have to give the writers of this half-hour series a lot of credit, being able to think up new situations every week, where only the skills of an experienced skydiver could ""save the day.""

Many kids like me (a 17-year-old) took up this sport, based only on watching this action-packed show, where, as Larry Pennell said at the beginning, ""This is the most dangerous show on television, with everything being filmed exactly as it happens.""  There was NO trick photography of any kind.  What you saw was what really happened.

If you let your own kids or grandkids watch this, expect them to want to start taking up Skydiving as a sport, just as I did.",1381276800,2,1042,4.7292817679558015
5730502,2,B00CMQIDVI,"I watched this show with a friend who ordered it on Amazon.com.

Picture and sound are very good  and the episodes are fun to watch.

But, and here lies the problem, when a company announces the ""Complete Season 1"", the customer expects all episodes of Season 1 ...

As two other customers already wrote in their reviews, there is a huge mistake in this DVD set.

Disc  3 should include the  episode ""Sentence Of Death"" . The title of the episode is printed on the DVD cover and is even included in the menu of the DVD.

Sadly, despite all that, the episode  is missing and in the place of the missing episode the manufacturer included  the  episode ""Elogy For A Hero"" . The episode  ""Elogy For A Hero"" is also included  on disc 5  of the set.",1381190400,2,743,4.2898550724637685
5730503,4,B00CMQIDVI,"This is better than what I thought from the first couple

well-packaged.",1380672000,3,258,4.375
5730504,5,B00CMQIDVI,I grew up with this show and seeing it as an adult it was just as much fun.. Not only that but my kids came back from collage and they liked it too...Plus I forgot what Ken Curtis looked like before he grew facial hair and became that American Icon Festus on Gunsmoke...It's so nice to see a show with imagination not to mention the cool 60's stuff and good morals..lt's funny as sometimes one has to go to the past to find progress... Wish they made more shows like this and less politically corect garbage like they try to force feed us these days....Thanks Amazon for giving us a choice.....,1379721600,3,594,4.36036036036036
5730505,5,B00CMQIDVI,"I'm sorry.  It's strictly an early 60's thing.  Very simple plots and the good guys always win.  Fights are always clean and the protagonists usually ends the fight in one punch.  Fun to watch because nothing at all about his show is complicated. I was 6 or 7 when this originally came out and I became fascinated with skydiving and actually did a couple of jumps when I was in college.  Not a lot of big name guest stars although Burt Reynolds is in one episodes. Pennel and Curtis work well together are believable even though some of the episodes are a little outlandish.  It does have a Route 66 feel to a lot of the episodes because the majority of the scenes are outdoors.  This season is in black and white while season 2 is in color. For the purists that expect complete episodes, you won't find it here.  I remember each episode would have Pennell and Curtis talking to the camera and addressing the viewers about the sport of skydiving in thirty seconds.  That clip does not appear in any of these episodes.",1379203200,3,1017,4.454054054054054

I highly recommend Ripcord.",1377475200,7,234,4.2
8583528,4,B00CMQIDVI,"It is a dated show. However, you have to go watch the series knowing that. Believe you are living in the time that the series was originally filmed. And you will enjoy it much better. To compare special effects and camera angles to that that of today is not fair. It's fun seeing actors who made their early appearances on shows like this. Season 1 has an early appearance of Burt Reynolds. i think the acting and plots were decent and I would recommend watching the series. The price is right and the quality is very good, for a series of this age.
What I did not like is the seller mailed the discs in a non-padded envelope. Luckily the discs are also protected by a decorative box that houses the plastic DVD holders Thus far have to seen any damage to the discs. I've finished the first three.",1528070400,,797,4.355704697986577
