221567,5,6300185117,"Most of the peculiar piquancy of this film comes from seeing two unfamiliar figures among all the good old stock types-Marlene Dietrich doing a parody of herself in THE BLUE ANGEL and Jimmy Stewart, a Mr. Smith going to a rough old-time Bret Harte town instead of to Washington. Marlene flounces around with great gusto and sings in that whiskey sublimation of contralto that's more fun than any metropolitan songbird. Stewart is drawly and slow-motioned, and always being bamboozeled, but you know that in the end, he is sure to unleash a streak of cunning and quick action and confound everyone. One of the most unusual pairings in the history of the screen worked like a charm for Dietrich and Stewart. As Frenchy, 38 year-old Dietrich is painted, tough and brazen the role revived Marlene's fading career (the public was tiring of her suffering glamour-puss roles) and it holds up as one her finest moments on film. As Tom Destry, Jr., Steward is polite, shy and awkward and their personalities contrast beautifully. The fight between Frenchy and Lily Belle (Una Merkel) is good fun and there's her classic ""See What the Boys in Backroom Will Have"" bit - Frenchy's death scene is truly affecting-something which is an attribute to Dietrich's acting ability.",958435200,,1261,4.952830188679245
221568,5,6300185117,"Fun at the movies was never quite like this. A superb cast goes through the motions and what motions they are. Stewart and Deitrich are amazing..Marlene takes her act to the sagebrush and what fun that is.
Mischa Auer was never funnier..Billy Gilbert and Brian Donlevy are just  on target and throw in a young Jack Carson and this film has a unique and  timeless stature .
Was this what Max Brand had in mind? Who cares !",955411200,,421,4.384615384615385
221569,5,6300185117,"Yes, there are wacky characters with Mischa Auer as a Russian wanna-be cowboy.  Brian Donlevy is his meanest conniving villianous self.
AND there is a hidden message too: ""You can't judge a book by its  cover,"" says Jimmy Stewart's Destry.
One of my favorite movies!",941587200,,266,4.888888888888889
221570,5,6300185117,"Well, with a name like ""Frenchy,"" what would you expect?  Throwing things, dancing on the bar, throwing more things, and singing is what Frenchy is all about.  This movie is famous as Marlene's comeback, and  also as the movie in which Marlene lost a little bit of glamour.  The big  moment comes when Destry literally soaks Frenchy and Lilybelle with water.  Lilybelle takes it like a pro, and leaves screaming without her skirt  (Frenchy ripped it off.)  Frenchy takes it like a woman afflicted with PMS  and goes off the deep end, throwing things (bottles, chairs, glasses, a  guitar, etc.) and finally falling on the floor.  She even rides Destry  piggyback, beating him over the head!  There's nothing like a good western,  and this is one of the best!",928454400,2,757,4.767441860465116
221571,5,6300185117,"I cannot get over how much I love this movie. Jimmy Stewart, my favorite actor of all time, could not have given a better performance.

221629,5,6300185117,"Lovable comedy western that stops just shy of out-and-out spoof.  Dietrich plays ""Frenchie"" the chantoozie who lights up little Climax with her torchy songs; Stewart plays Destry, Jr., the son of a tough-as-nails former sheriff, who has a few ideas of his own.  The two principals play off each other beautifully; supporting cast is fine, too.",1507939200,,343,5.107142857142857

221631,5,6300185117,"With the help of Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich) a dance hall girl from New Orleans, local ranchers in the town of Bottleneck are being swindled out of there land by the unscrupulous saloon owner Kent (Brian Donlevy).

Sheriff Keogh (Joe King) attempts to correct this and suddenly leaves town without his body.

Judge Slade (Samuel S. Hinds) who is in cahoots with Kent assigned the job of sheriff to the town drunk. Newly assigned Sheriff Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) remembers a previous sheriff named Tom Destry and sends off for the son of Destry, Thomas Jefferson 'Tom' Destry Jr. (James Stewart).

On the day of Destry's arrival with all the crowds are waiting in anticipation. Destry steps out of the coach with a parasol and a bird cage. Sheriff Dimsdale thinks he may have made a mistake.

Only time will tell.

I personally think there is more to this film than the surface story and subplots. It has a good after taste.",1504915200,,937,4.795031055900621

221674,4,6300185117,"This is a very good western from the late 1930s.  It is directed by George Marshall, who much later in his career codirected the sprawling epic western, ""How The West Was Won"".  The movie stars James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, both big stars.  James Stewart is also in ""How The West Was Won"".  The supporting cast is also strong.  James Stewart plays the strong, understated, folksy hero.  In certain ways it is a typical western, but it is very well done.  I enjoyed it very much and will watch it again.  Thank You...",1484179200,,522,4.537634408602151

221712,5,6300185117,"This is one of my all time favorites. I was about 12 years old when I watched this on AMC with my father for the first time. He had seen it many times and sort had to force this child of the 80s to watch a black and white film with her dad. I was not only hooked from then on to black and white films, but also to Jimmy Stewart and Marlena Dietrich... and soon thereafter, Frank Capra.

Jimmy and Marlena are superb together in this film. It's bpt surprising that they had a bit of an affair; there is a lot of chemistry there. All pf the acting in the film was done well however.

Should you want to end an evening with a smile, watch Death Rides Again. I'm forever grateful to my father for insisting I share that time with him, watching this film. I ended up naming our family Golden Retriever ""Destry."" Best dog ever. =) Have my own kids hooked now.",1474848000,2,853,4.1017964071856285

221753,5,6300185117,"This comic western features a brilliant performance from James Stewart as Destry, a marshall who doesn't believe in guns, but is a crackpot shot. Destry is on a mission to clean up the corrupt town of Bottleneck run by Brian Donlevy, with the help of a saloon entertainer named Frenchie (Marlene Dietrich). Directed by the almost forgotten George Marshall, the film is paced perfectly and features wonderful support from Una Merkel, Allen Jenkins, Jack Carson, and Mischa Auer.

221802,5,6300185117,"This is a western that stands out above the rest of them. The music is thrilling to listen to and Marlene Dietrich's part of Frenchy was well done. She sings 2 songs that steals the show. Destry comes to Bottleneck and meets Frenchy and the highlight of the film is at the end where there is a brawl in the bar and the bad guy is above at the top of the steps with a gun aiming it to kill Destry, but when the gun goes off Frenchy is the one who dies. It's a western and a comedy rolled up into one and it's one of my favorites.

This should have never been remade because in this movie EVERYTHING is perfect. If you watch ""Blazing Saddles"" Madeline Khan's imitation of Marlene Dietrich is just deadly.

His Father was a famous crime fighter. The huge enemy camp is disarmed by this. Marlene is a top notch bad girl. This movie plays up the premise of mistaking outward appearances. It definitely is a wild town. And ruled by evil. Destry turns out to be not the milquetoast he appears to be.

The shooting display he performed he was swinging that gun all over the place and hit the mark perfect, which was also sort of hard to buy.

(Just TRY getting her performance of ""See What The Boys in the Back Room Will Have"" out of your head!) Best of all is Jimmy Stewart in a cool, masterfully understated, and delightfully slow-talking, sympathetic performance as the title character. While it may take some viewers time to get used to the rapid-fire delivery of dialogue (fairly common in movies of this era) and, by modern standards, wildly over the top characterizations, you'll ultimately be hooked the minute Stewart steps off the stagecoach and starts to clean up the town. A true western classic. Highly recommended.",1342742400,,982,5.383116883116883
222097,4,6300185117,"This movie is very good, very funny in places, and with a really original story, especially for a western. You may not think so, because like many old movies, it has been imitated a good bit since, in movies and TV episodes.

A young and very handsome James Stewart is Tom Destry, son of the tough former sheriff of the wild frontier town of Bottleneck. Marlene Dietrich is Frenchie, who sings in the saloon and bounces her golden curls, and helps the local bad guy cheat at cards and win the ranches all along the pathway that cattle going to market must cross. Now that he's got the last one, he is charging 25 cents a head for cattle to cross his land. All supposedly legal, but as I say, the deeds were gained by cheating at cards, and suckering the owners into putting up their ranch as stakes.

The previous sheriff (long since Destry Senior was sheriff) disappeared, and the town jokingly appointed the town drunk as sheriff, who had been the deputy back when Destry was sheriff. So he sends for Destry Junior, who is known to be very good with a gun. That's James Stewart, who arrives on the stage and turns out to be nothing like anyone expected, least of all the sheriff. But he is sworn in as deputy, and announces that he will not carry a gun.

OK, that's the premise, and I'll not give anything away about how this slow talking, mild-mannered young deputy turns Bottleneck into a law-abiding town. It's just too good to spoil it for you.

One song from this movie got famous, ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have."" Frenchie sings it, of course, in that deep, seductive voice those who remember Marlene Dietrich know so well.",1337385600,,1646,4.458471760797342
222098,4,6300185117,"Destry Rides Again is a 1939 black and white light-hearted western, directed by a Hungarian (Joe Pasternak), stars a German (Marlene Dietrich) who is cast as a French woman, and has a Russian (Mischa Auer) playing a cowboy.

This was Jimmy Stewart's (1908-97) first of more than a dozen westerns he made over his career.  Stewart  needs little introduction. He ranks #3 on the AFI list of greatest male stars. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), although he's probably better known for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). He made nearly 100 films between 1934 and 1991, and was equally at home in westerns (""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""), comedies (""You Can't Take it With You""), and drama (""Rear Window"").

The film co-stars Marlene Dietrich (who got top billing) and has a supporting cast that includes Mischa Auer, Brian Donlevy, Billy Gilbert, and Una Merkel.

Marlene Dietrich (1901-92) appeared in more than a dozen films, some as early as 1919, before she had her ""breakthrough"" in ""The Blue Angel"" (1929), her first film with von Sternberg. They would make 6 more films together (e.g., ""Morocco"", ""The Scarlett Empress"", ""The Devil is a Woman"") and Dietrich would be nominated for an Oscar (""Morocco"" in 1930) and a Golden Globe (Witness for the Prosecution"" in 1957 - my personal Dietrich favorite).  Her performance as ""Frenchy"" in this film has been parodied in many films. She is sexy, coy, sly, lovable and laughable all at the same time. It's a terrific performance.

Brian Donley (1901-72) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1939's ""Beau Geste"" as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff (Thomas Mitchell won for ""Stagecoach""). He appeared in almost 100 films between 1923 and 1969, but his busiest period was the 40s when he did more than 30 films including ""Command Decision"" (1948), ""The Virginian"" (1946), ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), ""Hangmen Also Die"" (1943), and ""Billy the Kid"" (1941). Donlevy plays the crooked owner of a saloon, the type of villainous role he did best.

Charlie Winninger (1884-1969) plays the sheriff. The huggable actor made 50+ films, often playing a dad or a grandpa in films like ""Nothing Sacred"" (1937), ""Babes in Arms"" (1939), and ""Little Nellie Kelly"" (1940).

Mischa Auer (1905-67) was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), one of more than 100+ films he made, often playing a foreigner in films like ""Clive of India"" (1935) and ""Anna Karenina"" (1935). I liked him best as the ballet teacher from ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938). Here he plays a Russian turned cowboy, with his usual funny bits.

In addition to Jimmy Stewart, Auer is joined by another ""You Can't Take it With You"" alumnus, Samuel Hinds (1875-1948) who plays the mayor. Hinds was the fireworks- making father in YCTIWY. Despite beginning his film career at the age of 54, Hinds made 200+ films and is best known as Dr. Stephen Kildare from the film series.

Una Merkel (1903-1986) appeared in nearly 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actress in 1961 (""Summer and Smoke"") and won a Tony in 1956 for her role in ""The Ponder Heart"". She's best remembered for the hair pulling fight with Marlene Dietrich in this film, which is probably the best single woman vs. woman fight in film history.

Fat Billy Gilbert (1894-1971) was a comedian and appeared in 200+ films. He's best known for his sneezes, and was, in fact, the voice for Walt Disney's ""sneezy"" in ""Snow White"" (1937). He's best remembered for his role as Nazi official Hermann Goring in Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940). He plays a jolly bartender.

Another famous comedian, Jack Carson (1910-63) also appears, but in this film he is serious. Carson made 50+ films before transitioning to TV in the early 50s where he had his own show (1954-5). He's best known for his series of films at Warner Brothers with Dennis Morgan (""Shine on, Harvest Moon"", ""Two Guys from Milwaukee"").

Director George Marshall (1891-1975) keeps the action moving. He made more than 150 films between 1916 and 1969. This is probably his best known film. He also made ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), ""Houdini"" (1953), and ""The Sad Sack"" and worked on ""How The West Was Won"" (1962).

Hal Mohr (1894-1974) works the camera and does a great job in a film that requires a highly mobile camera. Mohr was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won twice - ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1943) and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (1935). His other notable works include ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Rancho Notorious"" (1952), and ""The Wild One"" (1953).

A film like this depends on the music, and Frank Skinner (1897-1968) does a great job. Skinner worked on  more than 200 film compositions. He was nominated 5 times for an Oscar, for films like ""The House of Seven Gables"" (1940) and ""Arabian Nights"" (1942).

The NY Times called it a ""jaunty and amusing chronicle"" and ""tightly written, capitally directed show, with perfectly supporting performances."" Time magazine said that it was ""charged with enough buckaroo comedy and sheer animal spirits to keep cinemaudiences chortling"" and called it ""best of the year.""

""Destry Rides Again"" is nothing less than a hoot. It stands up well, nearly three quarters of a century after it was made. It has the best damn hair-pulling cat fight ever recorded, the attack of the righteous women. Jimmy Stewart at his best ""aw shucks. Reminds me of..."" mood, and Marlene Dietrich as the best damn dance hall singer ever. What more could you want?",1303862400,,5502,4.87152034261242
222099,5,6300185117,They don't make them like this anymore. It is all about the personalities and not car chases explosions violence and sex.,1302739200,,121,4.809523809523809
222100,4,6300185117,"This is a typical 1939 black and white western where people get shot and fall dead with no puncture wound or blood shown. A black woman appears as a maid and speaks and acts in the typical 1939 stereotypical demeaning silly manner. James Stewart got second billing after Marlene Dietrich. The hour and a half film is filled with more humor than violence. Dietrich sings three songs with her German accent, but since this is 1939, and Germany is about to become an American enemy, she is repeatedly called Frenchy, to mislead us, as if we could be fooled.

 The action takes place in the town of Bottleneck, which is controlled by a saloon owner and his cohorts, including the town mayor. The saloon owner cheats a rancher at cards when Dietrich helps him by switching one of the rancher's cards. The rancher loses his ranch and cattle as a result of his bet. He figures out what happened and gets a rifle to confront the owner, but the sheriff intercepts him and promises to save his ranch. However the saloon owner kills the sheriff and the mayor appoints the town drunk as his replacement. The new sheriff sobers up and tells everyone that he is bringing the son of the fabled now dead Sheriff Destry to town to serve as his deputy. He will clean up the town, and Destry will ride again.

 Destry (James Stewart) seems like a dandy. He says he doesn't want to use a gun because people can get hurt; this is exactly what happened to his father who was shot in the back because people were afraid to face him and his gun. Viewers will enjoy seeing how Destry cleans up the town, how he resolves various conflicts using his wits, and helps the defrauded rancher. Viewers will find themselves, like Marlene Dietrich, charmed by the homey manner of the new deputy. They will also enjoy watching to see whether Destry gives up his non-violent approach to crime when the saloon owner kills his friend the sheriff, because, you see, despite his protestations, Destry can shoot.",1300838400,2,1971,4.590909090909091
222101,5,6300185117,"Love this movie! Just the right amount of comedy to keep it interesting without  turning it into a caricature. Others have mentioned the poor print quality -- it's a shame that a better one isn't available, but this film is so much fun, I'll take what I can get. I didn't find it distracting.",1297209600,,292,4.407407407407407
222102,3,6300185117,"First, let me say that I know very few actors who I like better than James Stewart.  I loved him in It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Bend in the River.  So, I looked forward with much anticipation to Destry Rides Again, a film, that I was sure would be one of his best because of its high user rating on Imdb and Amazon.com.  That said, this is not one of his better films and was a major disappointment to me and my entire family.
The story is simple, something along the lines of Support Your Local Sheriff with James Garner.  It's a proven formula that has worked many times in westerns.  This time, however, the hero of the film doesn't believe in guns.  He wants to clean up the town entirely without any kind of violence.  People laugh at him, and he does nothing about it.  Where is his sense of pride?  Why doesn't he stand up for himself?
Despite showing promise early on, however, Destry does not really fulfill its obligations as a movie.  There's some decent action scenes, some genuinely funny scenes, and Stewart gives his typically versatile performance as does Marlene Dietrich, but still the movie somehow falls flat.
The whole time the movie was progressing I felt like it was building up to something.  I was waiting for James Stewart to do one of two things.  Either realize that violence would be necessary to take on the bad guys, or beat the bad guys through his own ingenuity without guns or violence.  He does neither.  Actually, James Stewart's Destry in this film does very little.  He never really outwits the bad guys, and in fact his refusal to wear guns, and his lack of intelligence cause much harm.  Innocent characters die because of him, and the ending of the film where he is once more walking the streets of the city without a gun rings rather hollow.
The film's ending left me thinking, ""What?  That's it,"" and sadly that was it.  The film is roughly ninety minutes, but by the time you factor in two songs from Marlene Dietrich (both rather unremarkable) and a twenty minute intro where nothing happens but a guy getting swindled at cards, you have an hour of film.  That's my biggest problem with Destry.  It felt like someone started making a really good movie, then ran out of money halfway through, and tacked on a silly ending.  Maybe the ending was surprising and original back then, but now it feels so laughable and clich that I have to smile.  And that's all I could do with Destry Rides again: smile as I returned it to Netflix with the knowledge that at least I hadn't bought this mediocre film.",1271462400,2,2569,4.515151515151516
222141,5,6300185117,"Destry Rides Again is one of my very favorite movies because it has everything that you could ever want in a film- Wild West Action, Romance, Musical numbers, Drama, Comedy, Perfect performances by everyone in the film, Tear jerking scenes, a great director, great camera shots, and more. This movie grabs your attention from start to finish. I've seen this movie a number of times and never get tired of it. Back in the 1980's I took a trip with my parents by plane to Tucson, Arizona and while we were there we went to see the site of where this movie was made. When we entered the saloon and I saw the bar, I got real excited because I had seen the movie before we made the trip, and when I saw it in person it thrilled me. This film starts outside of the saloon with guns going off and yells from those involved in the shootings. The background music couldn't be any better than this as it puts you in the mood for what is to happen. I like the Black woman who is Frenchie's maid. There are several scenes with her that is really comical. One scene shows Frenchie with a tray of eggs and she asks the maid to put them on the table. The maid starts fussing about doing this and then she asks Frenchie, ""What'll I do with these here eggs?"" Before Frechie leaves she says, ""Try sitting on them."" The maid looks questioningly about this and says, ""I can't sit on no eggs. I would smash 'em."" You have to listen very closely to the dialogue in the movie because they talk fast at times and you might miss something. Charles Winninger is great as the town drunk who soon becomes the sheriff of Bottleneck. He looks at Frenchie and asks, ""Are you sure I'm the sheriff?."" Frenchie exclaims, ""Sure you are."" Then he says, ""I'm done with the liquor. It's either the bottle, or the badge."" Another side of this movie that makes it so good is the heavy fog of cigarette smoke that hangs in the air in the saloon. I love the scene where Boriss's wife comes stomping into the saloon and walks up to Frenchie and says, ""---and how'd ja do it, by making eyes at him?"" Frenchie has the nerve to answer her ""---than to be married to you."" Borris's wife answers back in anger, ""That's what I thought you said."" Then comes the fight between Una and Marlene(and you know, I don't know who really is the better fighter. They really go at it.) Tom walks up slowly and dumps a whole bucket of water on them and Una screams, gets up and runs out of the saloon. Frenchie feels she has won the fight and says, ""Get me a drink!"" The bartender does this and after she drinks, she sees herself in the mirror and shrieks. But before that happens Frenchie is so angry with Tom that she takes 2 guns and turns around and faces him. Everyone leaves the bar and Frenchie starts throwing beer bottles at him. When she sees that doesn't work she throws a guitar at him, and then picks up a chair to throw, but by this time she is worn out. Tom says, ""You're tuckered out."" To where she gets up quickly and starts throwing her fists at him. Tom gets the point and starts to leave, but he gives her one last tease and she comes close to hitting him with a beer bottle. Marlene looks very fashionable with her hair up in curls that sparkle and with the clothes she wears. I love how Wash steps into the saloon and says, ""Well, he's here.---and Frenchie, oh, this is someone that you have ta meet."" The drama keeps building up as there is bitter feelings between Destry and the bad guy (Brian Donlevy). Wash and Tom take a walk in town one day and they come to a hitching post. Wash tells him the story and when Tom questions him, he says, ""No---and the neighbors. Tom, you gotta get out a town."" The scene where the 3 bad guys come in town and one shoots a man and kills him, and Tom talks to them calmly and jokingly at first, but then he is boiling with anger and tells them off, Jimmy Stewart does this scene so well. Mischa Auhr and Una Merkel almost steals the show with their comedy. I love when Frenchie and ""Callahan"" are playing cards and he tells her his real name, but she ignores what he says and keeps calling him Callahan. Then comes the best part where Frenchie tries to decide what to do with him. He says, ""I know I got you beat."" He lays down his card and she lays down 2 aces. She says ""Ten bucks for your pants"", to which he says, ""My pants? Frenchie, you can't do this tome."" ""Off with those pants."" When he hesitates she smiles and says, ""Boys, get 'em."" It's comical to watch Wash get so fuddled to where he pulls his shirt up from his pants and gets nervous. There are some touching moments with Wash. One is where he hears that Tom doesn't have guns and that he doesn't believe in them. Wash is dejected and says ""---now you fooled me."" Tom encourages him, or at least tries to, and asks Wash to make him the sheriff. Wash doesn't want to do it, but with Tom's coaxing he says, ""OK, now repeat after me---"". It's comical how Wash asks if he will uphold the law, and all the rest that goes with it."" I love how this movie ends. There is so much action going on. The bad guys come and shoot Wash in the back. Recently I saw this movie and when this scene came I felt sad for him. The music that follows this scene couldn't be better as it makes you feel the danger of the trouble to come. The director of the movie did a fantastic job with the last scenes in the movie. The part where the men are shooting at each other and the women of the town march down the main street into the range of the gunfire, then turn and smash the bar windows and a large mob scene takes place. I love when Brian Donlevy hides down close to the floor and rolls the table over to the door. Frenchie tries hard to get through the crowd to be with Tom. When she looks up and sees Brian going into the room, she is afraid and calls out, ""Tom,"" and all this time Brian is looking for the chance to kill Tom, only to find that when he does shoot Frenchie gets it in her back and drops dead. To leave all of the action and the shooting scene and go to view a town where there is nothing but peace, it's hard to accept it at first. The girl in the back of the wagon who sings the song, Little Joe, this is a chilling scene as it brings back the memory of Frenchie when she sang it. I also like where Tom is talking to a woman friend and begins to say something that, to her, sounds like a proposal. She says, ""Yes, Tom?"" and the movie ends with this scene with the credits included. What a movie! If I could, I would rate it a 10. It should have won an award. The Great Depression was over and to celebrate, all of the movie studios came out with many hit movies. I'm glad that this was one of them.",1245369600,,6658,4.166020170674942

(Or was she photographed with a piece of gauze hung between her and the camera?)  Universal did her no favors in the hair or makeup department either; when wet, her hair looks great, but dry, it looks like a Shirley Temple doll with shiny cellophane instead of human hair, and the cellophane is constantly winking and glittering in the camera's lens, like the jewels or sequins in her corsets and showgirl outfits.  Now I know where Kylie Minogue got her total showgirl look.

It is a strange Western without Indians, though we hear them referred to in the dialogue, stories of how the elder Destry faced down a whole Comanche tribe, etc.  Otherwise the conflict is between corrupt municipal bosses, allied with gamblers, who scheme to monopolize ownership of all surrounding land--that is, anywhere that could be used as a cattle trail. Wonder if the movie was inspired by current events in Europe; James Stewart, reluctant to strap on the guns and live as his father did, has to make up his mind in the face of escalating and evil violence--an allegory for the isolationism of the US when Hitler was taking over Europe?  Everything fits, but if so, it makes the presence of Dietrich (and Mischa Auer) in the movie fit even more...  Still you'd think there'd be Indians, or would that be a distraction from the anti-isolationist politics of the film?

Needless to say, we loved it.  We devised a drinking game where we would take a shot every time the flustered sheriff pulled his shirt out of the front of his pants, and we took two shots every time Jimmy Stewart slowly and lovingly tucked it back in for him...  we cried the last time he did this...  in fact I'm still drunk.",1234224000,9,1915,4.633136094674557
222144,3,6300185117,"The first part was a little slow to me but once you get past it, this is an entertaining film which was popular with a lot of people, including this reviewer, who actually liked it better the second time around.

Marlene Dietrich plays a role typical for her, an edgy saloon singer named ""Frenchy,"" and except for her singing, which I never thought was very good, she's great to watch. James Stewart (""Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr."") also plays his normal role as the peaceful hero as does the too loud-and-obnoxious Charles Winniger (Destry's uncle).

The ending is famous, a strange one in which the town's women storm the bad guys in a bar, culminating with Dietrich and Una Merkel fighting it out! It's very unrealistic but memorable and certainly fun to watch.

All-in-all, a pretty fast-moving film which offers a little bit of everything: action, romance, drama, comedy....and a lot of good, known supporting actors I didn't even mention. This is one of the classics of a very famous year in films.  The shame of it is that the DVD transfer is very poor. I should have just kept my VHS copy of it.",1233878400,2,1102,4.664948453608248
222145,5,6300185117,"Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart make a great combination in ""DESTRY RIDES AGAIN"". This movie was directed by none other than George Marshall (who would remake it in 1954 starring Audie Murphy), was suggested by the novel ""Destry Rides Again"" by Max Brand, and co-starred Brian Donlevy, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, and Una Merkel. The basic story is quite simple, actually. The brawling town of Bottleneck is run with an iron fist by Donlevy, and one night, the town sheriff Keogh is ""mysteriously"" killed, and a new sheriff Washington Dimsdale (Winninger) previously the town drunk, is appointed for the job. But he feels that by himself, he will not be enough, so he summons Tom Destry, Jr. (Stewart) to come and help him out. What eventually happens in the end I would not dream of telling, but I feel that much more of the film is devoted to the development of character and comedy between the cast members than there is time devoted to the main story itself. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. If the movie was too plot-laden, it would have no life, personality, or originality to it at all. In fact, there is a sprinkling of the story here and there, but it does in no way bog us down. Consider the scene where Jack Tyndall (Jack Carson) threatens Destry by telling him that he will take the law into his own hands if he has to. Destry fires right back at him by saying that he will not, and then he proceeds to tell one of his entertaining stories about the cement worker friend who was once an opry singer but is now the cornerstone of the post office in St. Louis, Missouri because he fell into the cement. ""He should have stuck to his trade. You better stick to yours."" George Marshall was one of the great directors who could do plot and character at the same time. He shows how people do not trust Destry to regain the town, but in the same scene, shows Destry's fondness for telling stories and Tyndall's general mule-headed nature. Other classic scenes are the great catfight between Merkel and Dietrich, the gunfight towards the end, and the last scene where the credits roll while that great music is playing. The last scene is also one of my favorites from the whole film as Destry says ""Speaking of marriage..."". Janice Tyndall, who obviously liked him throughout the whole film, replies with ""Yes, Tom?"". By the eagerness in her facial expression and her voice, she apparently thought he was going to propose. But instead, he takes us all by surprise by saying ""I had a friend once..."" (notice that smile on Stewart's face!). What a great film. One of the best!

222146,5,6300185117,"I think that just about every film made in 1939 was great and ""Destry Rides again"" is certainly no exception to that claim..1939 was truly the Golden Age of Hollywood. I won't bother to review the plot as it is well covered in the many other reviews. I hesitated to buy the DVD as there were a few reviews claiming that the transfer was not up to par,overexposed,scratches etc. but I always loved this film and was willing to chance it and was glad that I did purchase it as the transfer to DVD was excellent,clear as any film made today if not clearer..I can only surmise that the reviews that claim that it was a poor transfer were referring to the VHS version and not the DVD.It certainly held up well for all it's 69 years and to see and hear Marlene Dietrich sing "" See what the boys in the backroom will have"" was worth the price of the DVD.

The quiet, straight guy, James Stewart, the typical dance hall queen, Marlene Dietrich, and the superior comedy of Mischa Auer, combine to keep the action moving, while the 'bad guys' get found out and peace is restored to the town again.

All of this with humour and fun, which makes it rank as one of the true classic westerns of all time.

If you have never seen Stewart or Dietrich on the screen, or even if you have never heard of them, this film will give you a glimpse of the hay-day of the American Cinema, when Hollywood was turning out hit after hit in 1939.

222212,4,6300185117,"It is true that there are parody elements in George Marshall's delightful ""Destry Rides Again"" but the real humor lies not so much in these sorts of antics, nor the heavily laid on inquiries of Marlene Dietrich as to the tastes of the backroom boys, but rather in James Stewart's no-gun Destry characterization...

This springs from the same source as Ford's 'characters', recognizable frontier independent-minded eccentrics, with a firm footing in American literature; characters often with a roundabout way of making a point, or pointing a moral, as with Destry's habit of prefacing each little cautionary parable with: 'I knew a fellow once who...' A habit that inevitably drew the aggrieved riposte: 'You know too many fellows, Destry...'

The other 'characters' in this film have more than a color or two of parody--Mischa Auer's improbable Slavonic cowboy, Charles Winninger's town drunk, Brian Donlevy, unprincipled boss, and Samuel S. Hinds' nicely played judge...

In retrospect, it's odd how much this movie gains from its rather touching little postscript... Stewart, the unconventional lawman, having pacified his cowtown, strolls the streets with a hero-worshiping lad at his heels, and yet also takes a little cloud of sadness along with him...

Marshall's film is considered a classic Western which manages to encompass suspense, comedy, romance, tenderness, vivid characterization, horseplay, songs and standard western excitements, without moving for more than a moment from a studio main street set... Hollywood expertise at its very best...",1162684800,2,1559,5.510460251046025
222213,5,6300185117,"'Destry Rides Again' is a film classic from '39 offering a strange melding of light comedy with a traditional western theme. It also features a rather unexpected collaboration of two dissimilar big name stars, James Stewart (Destry) and femme fatale Marlene Dietrich (Frenchy). It certainly wasn't a combination of talent I would have come up with for the romantic leads, but it worked well enough for this film.

'Destry Rides Again' has everything you could expect from a western and more. Plenty of bad guys and gunfights, an ill-fated romance and some unanticipated comedy that will bring you back again and again. One of my favorite sequences is when Destry ""schools"" a group of belligerent cowboys on the finer arts of target practice with a six-shooter. Unforgetable!

Besides Stewart and Dietrich there are also strong performances by; Brian Donlevy and Mischa Auer one of the great character actors of that generation.",1158451200,,927,5.132450331125828
222214,4,6300185117,"I'm an unabashed Jimmy Stewart fan and I readily acknowledge Destry Rides Again as a classic which every western lover should see and will undoubtedly enjoy. However, I also like director George Marshall's Technicolor remake of this film with Audie Murphy, titled simply Destry. No, Audie Murphy was not as good an actor as Jimmy Stewart. But, given a good script and good direction, Audie Murphy was a far better actor than his many B movies would lead one to expect, and Destry was one of his best performances. The fact that director George Marshall chose to remake his black and white Jimmy Stewart hit, Destry Rides Again, in Technicolor with Audie Murphy as Destry clearly indicates that Marshall felt his original film could be equaled, and possibly even improved upon. In this reviewer's opinion, he was right. Both the original and the remake are very good westerns and both should be available on DVD for western fans to enjoy.",1152403200,2,937,4.8625
222215,5,6300185117,"The box my DVD came in really played up the humor in this flick, going so far as to call it ""hilarious.""  That's dumb.  It had humor in it, it also had a good old fashioned plot.  And Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich.  And great songs (Loesser only wrote the words for this one, and with only one false rhyme - cousins/dozens/husbands), all put across by an amazingly flexible (lots of different feelings, not just the usual stoneface and deadpan delivery I've come to expect of her) Dietrich.  I loved it.  I won't give away the ending in case there's someone left who doesn't know it, but I wonder whether the musical (Rome, Griffith, Gray) ended the same, of course I never saw the Bway show, and it irks me not to know.  This movie actually made me dislike the Rome score that I have loved and enjoyed for years, and it also made me wonder how good Andy Griffith was in Jimmy Stewart's role.  I can't imagine it.  That part was made for Stewart.  All the parts were well-cast and well done I thought.  It's a great flick and I loved it.  Not so funny though.  A very serious plot with people getting killed.  No carnage, blood and guts like you would expect today, but dead is dead.  Still it was lightly done.",1139184000,5,1216,4.366071428571429
222216,4,6300185117,"James Stewart plays Tom Destry, son of a gun-toting hombre who made tame a fair piece of the wild west until some galoot up and shot him in the back.  We meet Destry on a stagecoach, riding to the wild town of Bottleneck, to help his pap's old friend maintain peace and order.  Junior is cut from different cloth, though, and unlike his famous father he doesn't believe in violence.  Doesn't even carry a gun most of the time.  Not an obvious recipe for success, not to mention survival, when the boys down at the Last Chance saloon catch wind of it.

  Originality didn't get DESTRY RIDES AGAIN (1939) placed on the National Film Registry in 1996.  Max Brand's story had provided plot fodder for a Tom Mix vehicle seven years earlier.  I don't think it was immortalized for its sophisticated and witty humor, either.  The comedy here, and there's a lot of it, is of the broad, guffaw brand, most of which survives reasonably well.  With the likes of New York born Allan Jenkins and foreign-dialect specialist Mischa Auer in the under-cast you can probably toss out authenticity, as well.

 What does work remarkably well is James Stewart as the laid-back, drawling frontier peace-nik who, inevitably, proves to be extremely proficient with the very weapons he shuns.  So proficient, in fact, that he is able to coax seven bullets out of the six-shooter that he uses to destroy a sign over the Last Chance.  Vital for this one, though, is Marlene Dietrich as Frenchy, a dance hall bad girl who, again inevitably, proves to have some good girl in her underneath all that face paint, when the chips are down and the serious lead is flying.

 If the story is a little creaky and you smile, a little-bitty smile, when you ought to be laughing out loud, at least you'll have the treat of watching a good cast work their way through a reliable plot.  Stewart and Dietrich have a good chemistry going, and the scenes with them are worth your time and the price of admission.  As usual, westerns, even those on the National Film Registry, are the poor relations of film.  That being the case, the print quality is acceptably unexceptional.  I've seen worse, but this jewel in the crown hasn't been buffed or cleaned for representation.  And, of course, there are no extras.",1138406400,,2265,4.652392947103275

Jimmy Stewart plays Tom Destry, a deputy sheriff who is quiet and reserved, and doesn't believe in gunplay, even in this wild, wild western town of Bottleneck. Marlene Dietrich plays Frenchy, the barroom belle who's in cahoots with the town swindler until she is won over by Stewart. She dies in his arms at the end, taking a bullet meant for him.

Dietrich's career was on the skids when she took this unlikely rough-around-the-edges role, and the success of the film made her a star again. When she sings ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have,"" the answer is obvious - and has nothing to do with booze. Stewart is excellent as the unassuming, soft-smiling deputy - a man with ""personality"" who is always being reminded of a story he once heard or knew. The bit parts are played to the hilt, to great effect. The picture is excellently paced and great fun to watch.",1135987200,,915,4.579268292682927

I first saw ""Destry Rides Again"" on TV back in the 1990s, and fell for it hook line and sinker. It's one of my favorite films of all time. Every Western clich is presented in a perfect balance of kitch and seriousness. Dietrich and Stewart *sizzle* on the screen together, truly -- the chemistry is undeniable. And there are so many, many classic scenes -- you've probably seen many of them parodied, but seeing them in context, for real, is just a priceless experience. Marlene plays the role she was born to -- it's so great to see her early films where she plays a refined woman, and then to watch this and have your jaw drop over the character she's playing -- she's so obviously having a ball. I had the pleasure of seeing this film in a theater as well, and the colleague I took was no fan of old movies, but not a quarter of the way in, she started sighing over how adorable Jimmy Stewart is.",1134345600,2,995,4.297872340425532

In this film, Deputy Tom Destry rides into the rough town of Bottleneck to clean the place up...without a gun.  Although he's an officer of the law, he's also a firm believer in taking care of business without a shooting iron.  His father was the legendary Tom Destry, Sr., who was shot in the back in cold blood.  Although he had the fastest hand in the West and the sharpest eye, as young Destry says of his dad and guns, ""They didn't seem to do him much good.""

But don't worry.  There's still plenty of shoot-'em-up action in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN as well as the kind of rare, witty dialogue you just couldn't find in most westerns from way back when or today.  DESTRY also features one of the defining performances in the career of Marlene Deitrich.  For those who love the parody of her in BLAZING SADDLES, most of that was taken from DESTRY.

Although DESTRY RIDES AGAIN is now 66 years old, it has aged quite gracefully, and is still funner than ever to watch.  It's a great movie, which very few people will not be pleased to watch over and over again.",1115942400,4,1151,4.412322274881516

However, very soon Destry begins to reassert his power as the law of the land - a pivotal epiphany that leads to violence and death. There's also some great comedy to be had - particularly in a scene in which Destry decides to cool Frenchy off - literally, by soaking her with some ice water. Dietrich's rendition of ""See What The Boys In The Backroom'll Have"" proves why she was the toast of Berlin cabarets for many years before coming to Hollywood.

Jimmy Stewart successfully transports his affable everyman from the Frank Capra films to the lawless town of Bottleneck.  Instead of guns, Stewart's Tom Destry uses guile and aw-shucks charisma to tame the savages.  Marlene Dietrich as Frenchy the showgirl is impeccable in her comic sultriness.  The highlight of the film is probably her showstopper, ""See What the Boys in the Backroom are Having"".  Brian Donlevy is slyly villainous as Kent, the town usurper.  One of my favorite comic touches here is the Cossack with the moniker ""Callahan"".  I thought the art direction here was particularly striking, most notably the interior of the saloon.

222252,5,6300185117,"Before I watched this highly-amusing comedy, with ""dramatic"" touches, it had always seemed so strange (to me), the coupling of reliable & naive Jimmy Stewart with the exotic, alluring and sophisticated Marlene Dietrich...and above all, in a western!!

It's true that she (Dietrich) had starred previously with equally naive and all-american Gary Cooper in both in ""Morocco"" and ""Desire"", but the former was a Pre-Code set in Von Sternberg's ""exotic"" vision of the world (the desert in this case) and the latter wasn't ""outside"" Diretrich ""bounds"" either (as a myth), because it was a sophisticated continental romance, produced by Lubistch.

But boy!, in this film Marlene is so different from her previous roles an highly convincing as a notorious saloon singer, ""Frenchy"" (she's from New Orleans, Louisiana), who's the mistress of the town's villain (Brian Donlevy, great).

After Bottleneck's sheriff (the name of the town) is killed, in rather ""obscure"" circumstances, Donlevy arranges that the town's drunk (engagingly played by Charles Winninger) is given the job, `cos it's for sure that he wouldn't cause any trouble at all...

But, he's wrong, as everybody else, because Winninger calls for Tom Destry to become his deputy-sheriff, whose heroic father he knew when he was young, ....but, wait a minute!!... this mild-mannered guy (Stewart) cannot be ""notorious"" Destry's son...but not all is said, `cos this peculiar guy is a no-nonsense man!

Great support too from Mischa Auer, as Winininger's hilarious Russian brother-in-law, so desperately trying to be addressed by his own last name (Androvsky? or sth. like that), and not as ""Callahan"", his wife's (Una Merkel) very respectable, late first husband.

Mention apart deserves one of the best women-fight I ever saw onscreen, between Merkel and Dietrich.

The only thing that displeased me was one ""aspect"" of the ending, which I'm sure must have been imposed by the strict Production Code regulations (you'll know what I'm talking about after watching the movie yourselves), but in all, it's a great film!

222256,4,6300185117,"I think the best word to describe this movie is fun. Destry Rides Again is a real treat. Made in 1939, this is both a traditional Hollywood western in some respects, and in others a great spoof of those movies. At heart, it's a comedy but despite this it also throws in the requisite western scenes. Often, however, there's a certain tongue in cheek quality to them.
The story is pure western: the town of Bottleneck (great name!) is all but lawless. There's a nasty land baron trying to seize the necessary lands to complete his control of the area. Once his, he can charge others inflated prices to cross those lands. The town sheriff, trying to impose some law, is shot and killed, his body disposed of in such a way that it won't be found. The corrupt town mayor then appoints the town drunk as sheriff. Now there is no law in Bottleneck. But ... The town drunk sobers up.
He takes his bogus position seriously and therefore sends for Destry (Jimmy Stewart), the son of another famous lawman.
Destry arrives and the fun really gets going. He's not what anyone expects. He's calm, relatively mild-mannered, doesn't wear guns ... doesn't even like guns. And of course, this sets up the final scenes when (as we can expect) he finally is pushed to a point where he does put on guns (a similar situation to Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider).
In the meantime, the filmmakers and the audience have loads of fun, including a cat fight between an angry wife and the town floozy, Marlene Dietrich.
In Destry Rides Again, Jimmy Stewart is perfect - he is so Jimmy Stewart. His famous halting pattern of speech is used comedically to suggest a kind of slyness. It shows the awareness and intelligence behind his character's meek exterior so we know this quality is part of the character's act. As an audience, we realize there is more to him than the meek exterior we see.
Dietrich is also good, though the name Frenchy doesn't quite fit her German accent ... but I suppose that's quibbling.
Unlike some parodies that simply mock a style, films that choose to take a kind of ""looking down the nose"" approach, Destry Rides Again seems to love westerns and love using the style to have fun.

But in this movie I simply don't like the character James Stewart plays, or the way he plays it. I can not remember the girl he ends up with at all and I actually think Marlene Dietrich's character is too good for him - for once, she has a genuine sparkle in her eyes and some human warmth, some life in her, instead of that blas, bedroom eyes look on her face.
How I love to see her singing ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will have"" and brawling and looking at people with her eyes open. To see her move at all is a good change from that impressive stillness she cultivated. I wish she had given us more of the persona she exhibits in this picture.",1069632000,,759,4.033112582781457
222258,5,6300185117,"In DESTRY RIDES AGAIN Jimmy Stewart is an easygoing deputy sheriff trying to clean up a corrupt frontier town without much help from his drunken boss. The movie has everything. It has action, suspense, comedy, romance and at least one very memorable song by Marlene Dietrich who plays a dance hall singer. Charles Winninger is the alcoholic sheriff and Brian Donlevy owns the dance hall which spawns most of the trouble in the area.
Marlene Dietrich is the sparkle which makes this film far superior to most other westerns and she is the reason it will remain a classic for a long time. A strong supporting cast includes Samuel S. Hines, Jack Carson, Mycha Auer and Allen Jenkins.
The movie received no Oscar nominations undoubtedly because of the stiff competition provided by its numerous first-class competitors in 1939 such as GONE WITH THE WIND. George Marshall also directed YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN starring W.C. Fields in that same year.",1060387200,5,950,4.906832298136646
222259,5,6300185117,"Western fans will enjoy this more than that year of release might indicate, but justplainmovie enthusiasts will dig DESTRY more than anyone. Throughout the latter 30s, Universal was making tentative steps toward competing with the Big Five's stable of A-pictures by essentially dressing up a series of surefire B-properties (such as SEVEN SINNERS, ARABIAN NIGHTS & THE SPOILERS) with deeper 'name' casts & costlier productions than had been their norm. It worked: late-30s/early-40s Universals were generally briskly paced, flavorfully acted, unpretentious entertainment - DESTRY was the first and one of the best, and it gave the studio the huge hit they'd been desperate for. Though most often cited for his brooding 50s work with Mann & Hitchcock, the young, darkhaired James Stewart - intense, soulful & sans his famous stammer - was already a great instinctive actor whose bone-deep rapport with audiences had  catapulted him out of Metro's male-ingenue doghouse the year before. His Tom Destry is not a Boys' Life one-dimensional hero but a nicely shaded performance that communicates both the character's decency and his core of strength perfectly. His presence dominates the film, despite the powerhouse cast surrounding him (Dietrich, Winninger, Donlevy, Allen Jenkins, Mischa Auer & the lovely and underrated Una Merkel). Though the picture's purely moonshine (by '39, the milquetoast-with-a-steel-spine plot was wheezing already), its pleasures lie not in the exposition but the exuberant execution. DESTRY RIDES AGAIN plays like a movie made by people convinced they were going to live forever, and I don't know if you can pay a simple genre entertainment higher praise than that.",1008201600,5,1692,5.458015267175573
222260,5,6300185117,"It's hard to imagine Marlene Dietrich starring in a Western, but oddly enough it works - and it works well.  James Stewart stars as Tom Destry, the son of a famous lawman, who is brought into an out of control town to  restore law and order.  One look at the tall, gangling boy scout has  everyone laughing at the folly of it.  Among those laughing is tough saloon  singer Dietrich, who's opinion of him soon changes.  Destry Rides Again  mixes comedy with typical Western action, and does so to good effect.  Both  Stewart and Dietrich are great in tailor-made roles.  Dietrich is famous  for singing the ""Boys in the Backroom"" song, and I must confess I  don't understand why her singing is so well remembered, other than to  politely say that it is certainly unique.  Mischa Auer is very funny in a  supporting role as one of Stewart's sidekicks, and Dietrich has a well  staged and memorable cat fight with Una Merkel that is a highlight of the  film.  Fans of the stars or the Western genre will want to check this film  out, since it is unusual, well made, and a real classic.",962409600,3,1082,4.479381443298969

7804526,5,6300185117,"This is the comic western that revived Dietrich's career.  A good bet for a laugh at anytime.  Dietrich plays a raucous, crooked, saloon singer who questions her way of life when the new non-gun toting Deputy, Jimmy Stewart, comes to town.  This is the character, reprised in many later films, that inspired Madeleine Kahn's ""I'm Tired"" song from ""Blazing Saddles.""  But Dietrich is far from ridiculous here, introducing ""See What The Boys in the Backroom Will Have"" and ""You've Got That Look"" engaging in a real (one take) fight with Una Merkel and completing a transformation that changes her from the town floozie to the town's savior.  Towards the end of the movie she rallies the townswomen to action taking an extremely active role seldom seen in a genre almost entirely devoted to male characters.  Stewart is sweet as cherry pie here, launching into ""I used to have a friend"" about a dozen times but managing not to bore.  He was a newly minted star here and the iconography of the character fits perfectly with this not really handsome new leading man.  Dietrich, completely smashing the ethereal image created for her in the 1930s absolutely rises to Stewart's level particularly in their first scene alone together where she comically trips while ordering Stewart to leave her house!  Shot in 33 days the buzz from the set was so good the movie was rushed through editing and premiered at Radio City Music Hall to huge acclaim.",1515110400,,1438,4.836734693877551
