8112351,4,B000EP02LS,"The last volume in the classic series includes both memorable and unmemorable matches:

Red Rooster vs. Brooklyn Brawler-** stars

The battle of soon to be jobbers. However, not as bad as expected, Rooster uses wrestling to beat the brawler.

*Brutus Beefcake vs. Bad News Brown-Ok match but horrible setup since Brown has no hair to cut. * star

Hackssaw Jim Duggan vs. King Haku for the crown-** star

Two stars alone for not being a squash for Duggan. Match could have been longer. Haku misses a flip and Duggan uses the finishing clothesline for the win. Heenan grabs the crown and cape and runs off. LMAO.

King Duggan Coronation-

Silly but very memorable segment especially to see all the faces at the time including the late Big John Studd.

Battle Royal-

*** -Definitely one of the better Battle Royals and one of the highlights of the tape. Royal features Demolition, Twin Towers, Mr. Perfect, Blue Blazer, Honky Tonk Man, Greg Valentine, Hillbilly Jim, and Bret Hart to name a few. Really great.

Hart Foundation vs. Rougeau Brothers with Brother Love as the referee

** -Total jobbing match for the Harts. It's obvious they won't win with Brother Love as the ref. They still make it enjoyable.

Hulk Hogan vs. Ravishing Rick Rude for the WWF Title

***- Reminiscent of the finish with Hercules Hernandez and Hulk from SNME a few years back. Rude makes this a great wrestling match. Hogan actually sells but we all know who will win. Still great especially to see Heenan rip into Hulk at the beginning.",1155945600,,1514,4.754789272030651
