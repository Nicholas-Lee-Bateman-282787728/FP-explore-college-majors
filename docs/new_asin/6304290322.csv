840011,3,6304290322,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other comments: the balance between content featuring John and content with Artur playing or speaking is off kilter. Artur's full-length performances and personal interviews on camera are what we really want to help us celebrate and remember Artur Rubinstein's marvelous music and artistry. For all those legions of Artur Rubinstein fans, what we really want to see and purchase on DVD is an art film that hit the silver screen in 1969 entitled ""Arthur Rubinstein - The Love of Life"", directed by Gerard Patris and Francois Reichenbach (also entitled ""L'Amour de la vie""). It was produced by Bernard Chevry. Please John Rubinstein, can we get this film released on DVD as well?  The market for it would be huge!",1102982400,13,743,4.991935483870968
840012,2,6304290322,"Terribly frustrating.
  In fairness, this documentary was originally aired on public television for an audience the producers apparently felt was more interested in Rubinstein's celebrity than in his music. But who if not music lovers will buy this DVD, and they will find only brief snippets of Rubinstein's playing.
  As for biography, the great raconteur does not get a word in to tell his own story until almost nine minutes into the program. Instead we are treated to a self-indulgent display of his son John's narration, analysis -- even his conducting!
  The many photographs of Arthur Rubinstein are marvelous (though other people in the photos are never identified), and a few moments with Daniel Barenboim provide desperately needed reflection.
  But -- tell me, someone - is there no better DVD providing a musical and biographical profile of Rubinstein? He deserves one.",1087171200,17,882,5.205673758865248

I'm in Los Angeles and if I didn't already have commitments on both dates I'd fly there to see it!  I saw it back when it was produced and have been trying to see it again ever since.
I went online again to see if it was available and found all these other people who feel the same way as I do.

Rubenstein is my favorite pianist precisely because that love is at the 'heart' of his playing! I would love to have this film as I remember it captured that so well.",1327622400,2,607,4.033333333333333
7867706,3,6304290322,"I saw ""The Love of Life"" some three decades ago and it left an indelible mark on my memory.  Great personal footage of Rubinstein, frank interviews, and footage of his concerts around the world make this movie a must see.  Please release this movie on DVD.",1306886400,,256,4.543478260869565
7867707,3,6304290322,"I join the many people here that really would like to see the Reichenbach film about Arthur Rubinstein on DVD.

This one is nice but too short and somehow not really thrilling. Whenever Rubinstein appears there is a glimpse of his fascinating personality. I'm not sure if it was a good idea to celebrate his father with a second class performance of Chopin's second concerto. Somehow this film turns out more as a film about a son-of-a-famous-father trauma than about the artist Arthur Rubinstein.",1257552000,,497,4.916666666666667
7867708,3,6304290322,"This DVD could very well have been named, ""Artur Rubinstein Remembered, John Rubinstein Featured."" Whew! I note one reviewer simply cut to the chase and stated the obvious, to wit, ""John, please shut-up!"" Clearly, it could be argued, I suppose, that the son was merely highlighting the father but when John does his Polish orchestra conducting debut and the only reference to the father is a bronze bust of the man, well, certainly there existed more footage of Artur Rubinstein available in literally miles of film where Artur could have provided more commentary then that which was included in the DVD. BTW, it is ""Artur"", not ""Arthur"" but never 'Art' or 'Arty' which would be akin to referring to St. John the Baptist as 'Jack.'

The consensus seems to be a call for more of the 1969 ""Artur Rubinstein: L'Amour de la vie"" [the love of life] film and, well, to put it bluntly, more Artur, less John. I agree. Recall the clip tho' in this DVD where Artur recalls visiting the famous ""throat doctor"" and Artur dramatizes the thing a la ""Doctor, please tell me, what is it [* he had lost his voice], I can deal with it whatever it is, tell me ... "" and the punch-line delivered by Rubinstein mimicking the doctor on the ""diagnosis"" is, ""You talk too much!"" Perhaps John should have reflected on his father's story a bit more!

Artur Rubinstein had a marvelous sense of humor yet clips abound of him not simply playing but commenting on all manner of issues and this would have been, in my opinion, a better focus of the DVD. The man himself. But remembered through his own words and manner of audience interaction whether through the keys of the piano or armchair conversation.

The focus seemed to shift between the man 'remembered' to a focus of his son John Rubinstein getting prepped for his conducting gig with the elder Rubinstein as mere onlooker from the Vale as it were. That's fine IF the title was ""The Rubinsteins"" ... but it was not.

Don't misinterpret now, certainly the family would have various comments to make and this is most welcomed but then there is the matter of a 'balance' which becomes rather cogent especially when the title suggests the singular Rubinstein versus the plural.

BTW, speaking of Rubinstein, I would also recommend the 74 minute DVD ""Artur Rubinstein: Historic Film of Rubinstein in Performance"" [Kultur] and available on Amazon and Amazon vendors where there is Artur doing the classic pieces of Chopin plus Mendelssohn and Liszt plus the concluding segment featuring Artur with two very good friends and musical colleagues both commenting and playing [with some light-hearted banter as well], Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky doing a rehearsal in Rubinstein's home. Memorable in every way.

7867709,3,6304290322,"Yes, this documentary is valuable to Rubinstein lovers, but not even close to the movie I saw in 1970:  ""Love of Life.""  It is unforgettable, and a must have for anyone who is a devotee of the man and artist.",1166572800,3,208,4.175
7867710,5,6304290322,"I too have been hoping for a video or DVD of this film. I saw it twice at the Royal Festival Hall, London when it was first released, but have not been able to see it anywhere else. It has not been on TV in the UK as far as I know.  Please will someone bring out a DVD soon.

7867711,2,6304290322,"I agree with another review that implores a dvd from the film titled ""Love of Life"", a documentary/interview with the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Here in Brazil the film was received, at that time, like a piano concerto: people applauded at the end of the exhibition! Please, the world deserves this gift.",1127433600,8,310,4.980769230769231
7867712,4,6304290322,"A tribute fashioned for the centennial of the birth of the great pianist Artur Rubinstein, hosted by his actor son John, this endeavour showcases the gusto of the artist while permitting the viewer to appreciate his vast technical power, with a large emphasis being placed upon Rubinstein's love for his native Poland, in particular Lodz, his birthplace. Interviews with Rubinstein and with members of his family comprise a large portion of this work, and these combined with home movies and too seldom shown concert footage allow us to understand how this keyboard master approaches his art, as well as historical background of his ardour for Chopin, of whom he is the preeminent latter day interpreter. Rubinstein's well-deserved reputation as a raconteur is highlighted, with examples, while his wife Eva and his children draw our attention to his rarely flagging delight in living, maintained even under the circumstances of nearly total blindness which ended his performing career years before his death in 1982, at age 95. Director/producer Peter Rosen emphasizes the obligation that Rubinstein felt to communicate with his audiences, no matter how small or private, and we are gratified at seeing and hearing the virtuoso perform portions of Chopin's second concerto, with both the Warsaw and Lodz Philharmonic Orchestras, in addition to solo performances of such as Falla, Schumann and Poulenc. Easily the best moments of the film are comprised of archival footage of Rubinstein in performance, taken from L'AMOUR DE LA VIE-ARTUR RUBINSTEIN, a 1969 work devised by the outstanding French director and cinematographer Francois Reichenbach, including segments from six of the pianist's favourite Chopin pieces, the Mazurkas; somewhat ironically, to experience the Gallic auteur's camera and lighting skills as we watch Rubinstein play these jewels causes the film at hand, with its many family-related digressions, to be somewhat pallid in feeling.",1105574400,,1954,5.452145214521452
