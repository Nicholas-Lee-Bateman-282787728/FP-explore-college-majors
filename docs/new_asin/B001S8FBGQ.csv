8438701,5,B001S8FBGQ,"This is an excellent series that is a must have for all aspiring students. There are not many resources available on this topic of manodharmam. I found every single lesson a treasure. Each topic like - Alapana, Kalpana swarm, neraval, RTP, Virutham is covered in great depth and many examples are given in common and uncommon ragas. After listening to these CDs (I got the MP3 version instead of the DVD for affordability reasons and I am an intermediate level student, so following an audio was not difficult for me), I am able to sing manodharmam for some common and even scales with confidence and am able to appreciate a concert and the technicalities better. Prior to learning from these CDs, my manodharmam was virtually NIL. Thanks to Prof. TRS for bring such an ocean of knowledge in simple layman terms.",1368316800,,812,4.76595744680851
