8490943,5,B0061SUOAG,"I learned a lot about village life in India and the challenges the villagers were going through.  This documentary helped tell the story of the villagers as well as the international students.  It was representative of many stories of exodus around the world, and I was transported to village life for a short while.  Thank you!",1320278400,2,328,4.821428571428571
8490944,5,B0061SUOAG,"This documentary was done quite tastefully and informatively. Taking a look at how life is on the other side of the world, where there are no Starbuck's at each corner, and you have to make and find your food, can definitely be refreshing and eye-opening from the every day American life.

This documentary demonstrates how hard life can be and how much that we should appreciate the opportunities and lifestyles afforded to us in the U.S.

Great documentary to show friends, families, classes, and anyone interested on a new take of life and/or Indian culture.

Great job Jeanne Yu!",1320278400,2,583,4.8686868686868685
