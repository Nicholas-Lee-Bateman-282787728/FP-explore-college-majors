7960474,3,B0000648XH,"Too much money was spent with the ""Classroom Experience"" audio (simulating the sound of a 16mm projector) than there was in compiling the films.  Many of the films have missing frames, or missing sections (despite the box's claims of being uncut).  Compare _The Last Prom_ with the Films, Inc. tape, and the latter has an end credits sequence that credits the whole cast (this is on IMDb thanks to me).  Instead it freezes on the last shot and jumps to the menu.  This is also the case with _Highball Highway_.  Presentation is everything, and this doesn't even have honest packaging.  It's an interesting collection.  Some of the films are does, others hilarious, particularly _Joy Ride_, _The Last Prom_, and _The Crossroads Crash_ (Apparently the National Safety Council had more than one of these--it's not the Edith-Mr. Albert-Andy-Rocky one from Technisonic, but a Jack Lieb production spoofing _Bonnie and Clyde_.)
With some correction, this could be a great set.",1081728000,6,970,5.10126582278481
7960475,5,B0000648XH,"Whoever had the idea to put this out is nothing short of genius! My favorite parts of the old Mystery Science Theater show were when they'd do the short educational films. Now, here is the oppertunity to perform your own version!
I had hoped for something a bit more 'gory' but overall I'd say that I was so amused by the rest that I can't say I'm dissapointed.
I won't give away too much here, except that its amusing to note that most of the 'drunk driving' films were shot in the daytime. I'm sure this so that the filmmakers could save on lighting. But it gives the appearance that people were getting tanked at 2 in the afternoon.
Little absurdities like that set the whole tone for this DVD, and its well worth viewing. Its just too damn funny not to!",1044316800,6,757,4.338028169014085
