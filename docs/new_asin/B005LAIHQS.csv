4728739,4,B005LAIHQS,"Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg are amazing in this film! You just can't take your eyes off them! This is the best film of the series with MiB2 being the weakest. I hesitated about seeing it but am glad I did ....in fact, I can't wait to see it a second time on DVD!",1337904000,3,263,3.981132075471698
4728740,3,B005LAIHQS,"The MIB have come to be loved by those of us who loved such sci-fi and movies like Ghostbusters etc.. and now the 3rd installment comes along out of nowhere, and after seeing it, I was a little disappointed with it. The general feel of the whole movie didn't feel all that fresh, and it repeated a lot of the same old jokes from the first two. I guess you could argue they are more of a calling card or what not, but I felt like I'd heard them before, especially since now they have been repeated in a re-write 3 times. Will Smith as J didn't seem to be as fun this time around, and K well, he is always the same, except now he has a new guy playing his younger self. As you can tell by the trailer, the plot is about an alien who escapes prison. This alien had his arm shot off by K back in the 60's, so he when he escapes he travels back in time to change history. J wakes up to find K is dead and has been since the 60's. So, without the need of thinking why he even still remembers K, he travels back in time to stop the evil alien from changing history.

A few other things bugged me in the movie, not just the repeat of the same old jokes, but the lack of introducing memorable characters. There isn't even the talking pug in this one, just a poster of him and a reference to what he is up to in the 60's... I dunno why they would not bring him back, but continue to include those annoying little worm aliens. It didn't feel like it was a fun joyride with a clever ending this time... in the last two movies, it was like, the action built on top of the action and kept rising to a final climax... but this one, euhh, it just goes and barely picks up any steam.

I didn't even really laugh much during the film, and when I did, it was a small chuckle, not a burst out laugh. It feels now like the original MIB made new grounds for comedy and the special effects where exciting, but now, it seems like common place and the original feel of excitement has become formula over everything else.
I'm not saying it's a bad movie tho, it does explain a few things you may have wondered and ties in a few things... but still, it does remain to keep alot of questions open, so I expect they will be back for MIB4.",1337904000,3,2209,4.029612756264237
4728741,5,B005LAIHQS,"I personally loved Men in Black 3. It was the first one in the entire series that I could relax and just enjoy watching. If you have to see one movie this holiday weekend then see Marvel's The Avengers, If you are going to see two of them then see Men In Black III. It is the best in the series and a solid B+!",1337904000,2,310,3.7846153846153845
4728742,3,B005LAIHQS,"The humor in Men in Black 3 feels really forced early on. Maybe it's outdated or maybe this concept has run its course, but everything fell flat with the entire theater in the first thirty minutes or so. The special effects looked off at times, too. They progressively got better, but looked kind of sketchy during the prison break sequence. If the budget for a film is $215 million, a green screen effect shouldn't be so noticeable or knock you out of the adventure because of its lackluster quality.

Everything starts looking up once J takes the time jump, which is odd since it involves his character going down. Suddenly, the supporting cast becomes extremely memorable (Will Arnett as J's new partner, Emma Thompson as Agent O, Bill Hader as Andy Warhol) and the writing gets much tighter. What helps quite a bit is Josh Brolin's incredible Tommy Lee Jones impression. It's subtle yet spot-on. The drawl is there, the facial expressions (or lack thereof), and pronunciations. You can tell that Brolin put a lot of time perfecting his craft.

The second half of the movie is the half they were writing on the spot. These were the lines that were being written moments before the actors said them on camera. The odd thing is this is the stronger half of the movie. Michael Stuhlbarg's Griffin character is one of the shining moments of the film. Griffin is able to see every future that could possibly happen (along with the past), but is never quite sure which future is actually going to occur until moments before it happens. His personality along with his enthusiasm has him steal the show at every turn.

Rick Baker is the other highlight. He created so many aliens and creatures for this movie. Once the sequel gets going, it's visually very appealing and Rick Baker is one of the essential reasons for that. These aliens are just a wide variety of bizarre, vibrant, and hideously fascinating. Baker more than outdid himself.

Despite a rough and rocky start, ""Men In Black 3"" is still decent. It's mostly due to the likes of Josh Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg's fantastic performances along with Rick Baker's exceptionally creative creature designs, but the ending packs an emotional punch. ""Men in Black 3"" feels like the type of sequel that isn't completely necessary and doesn't really offer anything new, but is still a nice addition for fans of a beloved franchise.",1337817600,17,2380,4.797560975609756

4729191,2,B005LAIHQS,"Men in Black 3 is a very good example of lazy screen writers that can no longer think of a good script so they just fake it and move on.
Want some examples?
The portly dude who gave Jay the time travel device, why does he remember the previous timeline?
Why is the time travel device so stupid and convoluted to use?
Near the end, with Jay's final confrontation with Borris, pay close attention to the BS physics of time travel, such as, instant healing, and no double up of you know...people. Watch the scene with your brain on and not your inner child and it is a farce.
Jay rips out a fish things innards and it went down but came back to life and is driven around the town in the back of a truck for the whole world to see. (makes no sense)
And even the ending isn't sacred, as the big reveal how Kay and Jay met, which completely flies in the face of the first and best MIB.
I know the first one has issues but it was the first one so it gets a pass for those, the second one was not as good but not as fast and loose with the rules as this travesty of a film goes.
Best part was Josh Brolin doing Tommy lee Jones impression and that's it.

Warning not related to this review.
Amazon have shortened their return policy from 90 days to 30 days.
I lost 600.00$ on an HP Laptop because of this.
I guess you need to verify the return policy everytime you buy on this website from now on, because it used to be 90 days.

4729197,3,B005LAIHQS,"Liked the movie almost as much as the first one, but the 4K version with HDR was a let-down. Maybe a 4K bluray might look better, but the streaming version didn't impress. It didn't look sharp. Not even as sharp as a bluray, let alone a 4K presentation. Reminded me of an image on a TV with the contrast pumped up too far and blacks a bit crushed too. I expected to see a clear improvement over the 1080p version I already owned, but I just didn't see it. This is not a review of the film (which I liked very much) but of the 4K streamed rendition. Even three stars is giving it a lot of credit. If you already own the movie on bluray, don't spend the extra money to stream it in 4K.

They go back in time to stop the alien this time and we get to see a young 29 year old version of agent K in the late 1960's.

4729757,1,B005LAIHQS,"It's just bad. A muddled mess from start to finish. There are plot holes, twists that are telegraphed from a mile away, and the time travel aspect interrupts the flow of many scenes, especially the climax. There are also scenes that are shot so poorly and chaotically it can be difficult to even understand what is going on.

As an added bonus, because it involves time travel, this movie is also mostly exposition, and that drags on and on.

The worst part though, in my opinion, is how bad all the effects look. Rubbery and cheap looking CGI has replaced the practical effects that made the first movie so memorable. Also, in regards to the super creepy alien in the first movie, this one is much more kiddie friendly, but in a bad way where the movie makers things kids are dumb and scare easily.

It's just not fun and not so bad it's good. Just pretend this one never happened.",1468368000,2,882,4.46583850931677

4730389,4,B005LAIHQS,"Expected this to be yet another ""throw away sequel"" even though I am a fan of MIB. The first one edged out the MIB 2 in my mind and as our daughter showed interest, we watched both of the first two (tough for a kid to not love Agent F, the talking pug) recently and she asked to watch the third installment.  I've got to say it didn't disappoint and in fact, I think it had the strongest script of the three and definitely the most effective storyline. The end catches you off guard and also pulls a ""refresh"" of the storyline opening it up for effective future versions.

Let's put it his way. If you liked/loved either of the first two, you'll not be disappointed by this one as the sly remarks from Will Smith remain intact while getting plenty of the goofy / creepy alien characters. The villain is excellent and Griff is one of those special characters that is a pleasure to watch (assuming I remembered his name correctly). But for the first time you actually get a strong story that challenges you a bit and also mixes in your love for, ""Back to the Future"" movies (how can you not love ""Back to the Future"", right?

4730907,5,B005LAIHQS,"I have made it a personal endeavour to find the best 3D content that the second generation 3D hardware is capable of rendering. It depends greatly on the context of the film and the director's vision as to what optical candy gets used where in equal parts of when why and woah. This is how 3D films are being made now. Gone are the days of smudgy gorillas growling at cameras and paddle balls bouncing off your forehead (all due respect to House of Wax).  Now the viewer can be immersed into the environment of the antagonist or protagonist depending on your flavor, depth that once gave a simple reach in and touch the back effect to having objects or people or land formations  or spaceships writhing with creatures alien bioware technology that pops off the screen with no artifacting in sight. Some of the coolest scenes in this gem are during up close and personal dialog between characters and there's all sorts of 3D weirdness going on in the shot in layers. What used to look like box panaramas can now be digitally enhanced in so many different ways you feel like your eyes are going to pop out. This is the only movie to date I've seen that makes a car ride look completely realistic and vibrant and I don't have to tell you what that means for the viewer of a car in an MIB film. If you know anyone who has or is thinking of getting a 3D home theater, I highly recommend getting them this movie.  Bravo to the 3D design team on this one. I guess I should talk about the actual movie. Relax. I don't do spoilers.  That being said this is a genuinely funny film. There are a lot of laugh out loud moments and the 3D complinents  the story, the jokes and the weirdness with the adept professionalism of crystal glass juggler on on mind altering substances.
The comedy of Smith and Jones is spot on as your every day agent type team exchanging esoteric dialog in expository format, a lot of which are referencing the prior two films' character development and where they are now in the more than obvious father/son subtext. But its well done and presented in a somewhat more mature fashion than you might expect from the franchise. Again, the 3D is very much in a lead role along with Jones and Smith as you can almost immediately tell they are trying to carry on their daily routines while all the 3D mayhem takes centerstage.  And that is when you know you're in for something special. Plus, field sequential digital 3D doesn't strain the eyes or hurt the head.  Is this Martin Scorcese Hugo 3D?  No but that's the point. Its Men in Black 3D.
Just for reference for anyone who has considered 3D as an addition to their home theater now is probably the best time. As of the time of this review, the second generation is being phased out with third generation hardware. Which looks fantastic by the way and if they've improved on immersion technology at all, combined with Windows 10 or the Xbox One, virtual reality is here. But I like many of you live in the real world and paying upwards of 6k for a tv with embedded 3D is out of immediate reach.  But that is where 3D home entertainment is going. Its a luxury item. Why do I say this?  Because the 3D second gen hardware is affordable now. I bought a Vizio 55"" LED (the smooth motion makes the 3D look amazing) a samsung 3D bluray player and 5.1 dts theater for about $500 all told. Get the passive technology like in the theater. The active technology doesn't improve the image noticeably enough to warrant the upcharge not to mention they're rather expensive and they are fragile so if you have kids, the glasses like you get at the theater work. Inexpensive and you won't rupture a blood vessel if you have to replace a pair.  I'm immensely satisfied with my system and Amazon here makes buying 3D movies a lot less painful. I just bought Antman 3D for 16.99. Is Antman's 3D good?  That's a different post. Later. I'm going to play Star Wars Battlefront. In 3D",1449878400,6,3924,4.4422809457579975

This installment gives Will Smith an opportunity to be funny, serious, sarcastic, and you can tell he is comfortable in this role.

4731142,5,B005LAIHQS,"This movie really brings the heart and soul into the Men in Black series. Since the series debut in 1997, the story never quite took a personal side within characters. However, in third edition it get's quite personal with agents K and J as to how their relationship establishes and it's importance to the world. Even the relationship between Smith and Bronlin(younger K) seems to be as smooth. I'd say this movie really brings out the deepened heart in the series with the amount of emotion portrayed by each character. I think it's a wonderful way to wrap up the series as to now we understand how Agent J got where he's at and just how close him and k really are.",1446681600,,666,4.467213114754099

4731284,2,B005LAIHQS,"Please note that this review contains spoilers. Ill talk about my 3 likes, 3 dislikes, and final thought:

3 Likes (L1  L3)

L1) Within the first six minutes of this movie, Boriss role as the villain is confirmed after hes shown doing two irresponsible things: one, he kills another prisoner whom he promises he would take with him, and two, a woman helps him escape, but he unappreciatively lets her get sucked out into space when he has the option to prevent this from happening. I like that his role is confirmed within the first six minutes because I could stop thinking about it and focus on other aspects of the movie.

L2) J (Will Smith) asks the man who gives him the time-traveling device, How come I remember K [Tommy Lee Jones] but nobody else does? The man replies, Whoooa! Whoa, that means you were there! I didn't understand what the man meant, but I saw the explanation toward the end of the movie, and I like closures.

L3) During Js fight against Boris, J demonstrates a personality trait that he also shows in MIB: he goads Boris into attacking him by repeatedly saying Boris the animal, which is a term that Boris dislikes. In MIB, J goads the alien cockroach by repeatedly doing something that it dislikes: stepping on other cockroaches. I like that a personality trait appears again in this movie because it exemplifies an actual and therefore believable side of all humans: the presence of a behavioral pattern.

3 Dislikes (D1  D3)

D1) One scene that I don't understand is when K is in his apartment: he takes a gun from a hidden area, sits on a chair, powers on the gun, and then disappears. I understand that he disappears because Boris kills Ks past self, but I have two questions that I cant answer: whats the purpose of showing K doing this? Whats K planning to do with his gun? I dislike when any story ends with one or more unexplained parts.

D2) Before he finishes his fight against Boris, J uses the time-traveling device to return to an earlier time during the fight. After he does this, his injuries disappear, and he dodges Boriss attacks as though he could recall them because he had already seen them once.

I don't understand why Js injuries disappear after he uses the time-traveling device but his memory remains unaffected. Also, if the memories of time travelers remain unaffected, but they experience a physical reversion--which affects parts of their body other than their brain--that matches the time to which they travel, then why doesnt Boris get his arm back by traveling to the time when his past self still has both arms? As I said in D1, I dislike when any story ends with one or more unexplained parts.

D3) At the end of his last conversation with J, Griffin--someone who helps J to prevent Boris from killing Ks past self--says, Anythings possible; however, he contradicts this twice by stating the following two claims (C1 and C2) in an earlier scene:

C1. He must deploy the Arc Net as he did before. There's no other way. K is the only hope in saving Earth.

Griffin is saying that K must deploy the Arc Net to protect the world from an alien invasion and that K is the only one who can do so. If anythings possible, then why does no other way exist to protect the world? By stating C1, Griffin is implying that no other possibility exists, which means that anything isn't possible; otherwise, why cant someone else deploy the Arc Net? Why cant K use a different device? Why cant someone who isn't K use something that isn't the Arc Net?

Why cant everyone avoid doing anything and still experience the outcome that the world is protected?

C2. But where there is death . . . there will always be death.

By stating C2, Griffin is saying that because someone has already died, this person needs to remain dead: in other words, because a life has already been sacrificed, this establishes the requirement that a life must remain sacrificed, so no other possibility exists. If, again, anythings possible, then why does this requirement need to exist and be met?

The answer to all of my questions in this section, D3, is that anything isn't possible.

I dislike this aspect of the movie because it leads to a conclusion--Anythings possible--thats false within its own fictional world and because the character who states this conclusion/claim is the one who disproves it more than once. I wouldnt dislike this if Griffin were a villain because one of the traits of villains is to behave irresponsibly and unreliably by doing contradictory things, but Griffin isn't portrayed in any way as a villain.

Also, I said that Griffin contradicts his claim, Anythings possible, two times, but these aren't the only times that he does so.

Final Thought

Because of the unexplained parts that I mentioned in D1 and in D2, and because of the contradictory writing that I explained in D3, I dislike this movie by one stars worth more than I like it, so I rated it two stars.",1445212800,,4920,4.638665132336018

4731420,4,B005LAIHQS,Probably the best yet of the Trilogy!  Lot of twists and turns and plenty of surprises.  Answers a lot of the questions raised in earlier episodes.  Still exhibits that tongue-in-cheek humor that Will Smith has delivered throughout the trilogy.  Probably a little too much graphic violence for the younger kids;  but fine for adults and teenagers.,1443484800,,347,5.125
4731421,3,B005LAIHQS,I predicted they would make movies about scifi and comics,1443484800,,57,4.8

4731991,4,B005LAIHQS,"This film belongs to Josh Brolin, and well it should. The plot is nothing to write home about, but who the heck cares?  The plots have never been the point of the MIB films. They're all about Smith and Jones, and if you know and love J and K from the previous two installments, you have to see this one to marvel and the perfect K-ness of Josh Brolin. The man NAILS it, and yet, it's not a complete impersonation because this is a much younger K. A twist on an established character, not a recreation of it. You just have to see it to believe it.

I said the plot doesn't matter, but that's not quite true. There's a twist at the end that makes the whole darn series make better sense, and that bit alone would make the movie for me. It adds some unexpected depth to the relationship between J and K, but is in no way syrupy. It's great.",1437004800,,837,4.128834355828221

I would give it a 4 star if it were a stand-alone, but it's a 5 star for sequels.

I love this whole series of movies (I'm ready for a few more), but the first one was vastly superior (probably because of surprise value) to the second. This third edition, however, is really well done and full of surprises. I don't know how this did in the box office but it's a really fun film to watch on a big TV.

4732623,5,B005LAIHQS,"Try as I might, when I start hearing rumors of a troubled production for a film, I start to worry it won't be any good.  And since I was hoping that Men in Black 3 would be good, I was really worried.  But I decided to see it anyway.  I'm glad I didn't let those rumors scare me away because it turned out to be lots of fun.

Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are still working for the Men in Black to keep aliens under control and secret from the rest of us.  As they are cleaning up the latest mess, word reaches them that Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped from his prison cell in the Lunar Prison.  A run in with Boris shakes K, but he still won't open up about it to J.

The next morning, J arrives at headquarters to find that no one seems to have any memory about agent K.  But as J pieces things together, he realizes that Boris found a way to travel back in time and kill K.  So J chases him to 1969 to rescue the young agent K (Josh Brolin) from the alien.  Will J succeed?

The biggest rumor I'd heard about this movie was that it shut down production before they really got going on the 1969 part of the film.  If it was to retool the movie, it was well worth it.  While I enjoyed parts of the set up, things really get going when we hit 1969.  While we avoid most of the predictable time travel jokes, there are still plenty of laughs, and the story really seems to pick up speed, too.

Not that this is the most original story out there.  You can pretty much see the big plot pieces coming before they happen.  But there are enough surprises to make things interesting.

And it's just plain fun.  You can tell that those involved were enjoying making this film, and that really comes across on the screen.

Tommy Lee Jones doesn't have that much to do, but he makes the most of what he has.  Others from the first two films are noticeably absent as well, although a few of them get cameos or a shout out.  Emma Thompson has a fun part as Agent O, the new leader of Men in Black, although again she isn't in much of the film.

That leaves it on Will Smith to hold things together, and he does a great job of it.  He makes it feel like no time has passed since we last saw J.  And then there's Josh Brolin, who plays the younger K.  He does an amazing job of channeling Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal, and I could honestly believe that it was the same character.

The effects are up to today's standards and are great.  Like the first two films, a few bits will upset the squeamish, but they aren't any worse than anything else in the franchise.

So don't let any rumors about Men in Black 3 keep you from seeing it.  This is a fun movie that you will enjoy.",1432771200,,2690,4.07824427480916

The formula is pretty much the same as in the previous two movies and that pretty much says it all. The chemistry between Smith and Brolin adds some depth but otherwise this is a by-the-numbers sequel thats not as funny or as clever as it thinks it is but is never a chore to watch.,1423440000,,401,4.2894736842105265

4733820,4,B005LAIHQS,"Usually the last movie in a trilogy is the stinker. Godfather 3, I rest my case. In this case all 3 MIB films are fun and retain your interest from beginning to end. To say which I like best is not fair since I like all three. This is the latest and newest of the 3 and that is probably influencing me to say 3 is the best of them all. To be fair 3 has elements of the previous 2 which is a easier to write then actually coming up with something new for us. I would normally fault the film for doing that but in this case they made it so interesting and fun that even though we have seen basically the same movie for the third time now we still manage to enjoy it. Because the agents stay the same and the basic plots are identical the only thing that makes it worth watching are the characters that change. thy don't change much. The wacky guy in the video store changed to a wacky guy in a photo shop. The cat that carried the little gizmo to save the world changed to a guy that carried the little gizmo that saves the world. Same movie as the other 2 just spin it a little. Even though they rip us off over and over again by making the same basic film they did a good enough job that we enjoyed all 3. these movies are simply fun and entertaining and that's what they were made to do. They are not epic classics and they were never meant to be. If you liked the first 2, I think this one is as good maybe even better, enjoy!",1419724800,,1428,3.9618055555555554

4734561,5,B005LAIHQS,"MIB 3 (Men in Black 3)
 Just when a fan becomes despondent at the current crop of gigantic summer flicks along comes MIB 3 to bring hope and cheer to his heart.  Producer Steven Spielberg brings back our old pals agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) under the control of MIB and MIB 2 director Barry Sonnenfeld to amaze, delight and choke us up a little.  Grand.  Sonnenfeld also directed such successes as Get Shorty and The Addams Family.  Writer Etan Cohen showed his skill with the comedy about Hollywood movie making Tropic Thunder and hasn't missed a beat here.
 The producers spent at least $230 on making the film and some estimates of filming and advertizing go as high as $375 million, an incredible figure even in this day of stupendous budgets.  For once, the money is very well spent.  A movie must have characters and a story that involves the audience in order to be valuable (or successful).  Having loads of cool special effects isn't enough-as we have seen with John Carter and Battleship already this year.  There are loads of cool special effects in MIB 3 but they enhance rather than overwhelm the viewing experience.  For example, there is about four seconds of film where the disloyal but cute little aliens that we last saw fleeing Earth in MIB 2 carrying cartons of cigarettes with them appear, fleeing again and muttering this planet is toast.  Cute, funny, finely crafted special effect this is-and entirely un-necessary.  Sonnenfeld and Spielberg put it in because it was fun and because Spielberg is a master film maker.  The film broke ground at number one, displacing Avengers, another excellent big budget blockbuster.  MIB 3 has already made $203 in worldwide ticket sales and whatever they spent will surely turn a tidy profit.  This is a good film and rates a better than average four saw blades.
 Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as agents J and K.  When a super villain escapes from a super-max prison on the Moon he further escapes into the past and kills K, thus changing time.  J must follow the baddie into the past, which gives the music director a chance to remind us that the best music came from the sixties.  Josh Brolin plays the young agent K with just the right amount of deadpan seriousness and warmth to make the personality change to the irascible older agent K explainable.  Emma Thompson replaces agent Zed (Rip Torn) as the boss of the MIB agency, agent O.  Watch for a great performance by TV actor Martin Stuhlbarg as Griffin, an alien precog.  He tries to put the best face on future events, which most of his calculations show to come out in one disaster or another.
 MIB 3 is much better than MIB 2, which lacked cleverness and soul.  MIB 3 runs one hour and 46 minutes.  The PG-13 rating precludes and bad language or nakie people, so most of us can enjoy it.  I liked it a lot and I bet you will also.  There is a heartwarming surprise which got to me, but I am a softie.
 This is the first time out for Will Smith since 2008.  In reviewing his filmography I realized just how many exceptionally good films this major Hollywood star has made.  Back to work, please, Will.  We want more.",1411430400,,3162,4.561278863232682

Josh Brolin is brilliant, as he was in W; I think he's Tommy Lee Jones' illegitimate son, and he'll nominate the Democratic candidate for President in 20 years. It's very funny, it has great action sequences, and the bad guy is the nastiest one they've had yet. He feels more real. And it's pretty moving at the end, unusual for this series.

At first I thought the concept not fitting, however, Brolin pulled it off in the same way the original team of K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) first did in the original Men In Black.  While it'll win no awards for storyline, it was darn good entertainment right across the board.

4735958,4,B005LAIHQS,"For some reason, I had less than high expectations for this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  While not having quite the same degree of edgy humor that the first first film in the series has, it does demonstrate the progress made in special effects over the past 15 years and the visible aging of the two lead actors.  It is notably superior to the second film of the series ""Men in Black II"" (not ""2"" oddly enough) which I thought to be a real misfire.

Josh Brolin effectively portrays the young version of ""K"", Tommy Lee Jones' character, with time travel being used as a device in the story. It's to be expected that any deep thinking about time travel ultimately ends in an insoluble paradox, but, what the hell, the movie is fun to watch and it has a fine supporting cast including Jemaine Clement and Emma Thompson, of all people.  Danny Elfman's music score is, as always, a pleasure to hear and is well recorded.

This movie definitely benefits from being seen in Blu-ray.",1391904000,,985,4.573863636363637
4735959,4,B005LAIHQS,"The MIB franchise is worth seeing in its entirety, this is the second best of the three, with MIB 2 in third place. I appreciated the poignancy in this one, also the multiple timeline scenarios add more dimension. Speaking of dimension, the fact is that we have yet to see any good treatments of multidimensionality in any sic-fi so far. How long must we play along with our dumbed down status?",1391731200,,394,4.563380281690141

4736099,5,B005LAIHQS,Men in Black 3 is a huge improvement over the disappointed effort of MIB 2 in both storyline and plot wise. MIB 3 revolves much around the prequel of the main storyline of the MIB universe to how Smith grew up to become an agent and met Jones during his career.

They may be older but they're still goodies, as J and K and a much younger version of K, fight to save the world (again).  I'm not wild about time travel, in fact, there are only two other time travel movies I really liked, but this one is so good I can ignore that problem.  John Brolin is a great Young K. He has the characteristics and the accent down pat.  Will Smith is as good as ever and Tommy Lee Jones...what can I say?  He's still K.  Missing is Rip Torn as Zed, unfortunately.

4736474,4,B005LAIHQS,"Rarely do you see a second sequel that can be considered ""great"", ""enjoyable"", and other such things.  But when you line the three Men In Black films up next to one another, Men In Black III has certainly surpassed Men in Black II.  While it is not as good as the original, this film can definetly hold its own.  Of course, the highlight of the film was Mr. Josh Brolin, who not only had to step into the enormously large shoes temporarily vacated by Mr. Tommy Lee Jones, but he had to keep his performance as a younger Agent Kay consistent with Mr. Jones's as the latter appeared as the character's older self at the beginning and ending of the film.  Of course, Mr. Brolin did this flawlessly and came off as the perfect younger Tommy Lee Jones while giving the character some perfect qualities we haven't seen before.  Will Smith was back in his own, comfortible shoes, playing Agent Jay and my only complaint there is that we could have done without his rantings during the various neuralizing sessions.  Men in Black and Men in Black II always did those better.  If there was a joke in these new ones, I missed it.  The only one that worked is the one where Jay trickes the 1960s NYPD officers into neuralyzing themselves...that worked perfectly.  I wish I could have seen Rick Torn as Agent Zed again as he too was a classic character, as were Frank the Pug, Jeebs, and the Worm Guys, the last of which we only saw very briefly (too briefly).  But for all my complaining, this film was still awsome.  Jemaine Clement made an excellent villain as Boris the Animal (or ""just Boris"") and I enjoyed the plot twist of ""Andy Warhol"" being an undercover MIB agent.  Had I known the specifics of the powers possessed by Michael Stuhlbarg's character Griffin ahead of time, I would have called them far-fetched even for a Men In Black film.  However, not knowing allowed me to view all that with an unbiased prospective and that made all the difference.  Those powers worked in this plot and Mr. Stuhlbarg was very enjoyable to watch as a being burdened by his ""gift"" and who choices to instead of moarning the loss of his homeworld, help prevent Earth from suffering the same fate.  Also, his nervous ticks and related behavior were amusing at the proper moments.  Overall, any MIB fan should get their hands on this installment and hope for more of this quality in the future.

WARNING!  SPOILER ALERT!!!  The above statement needs to change Best to Worst.  The first one is still the best one yet.  One thing that I did thing was strange was the look of MIB headquarters.  We open up in the present and MIB HQ has a new look.  Way different from the look in the first movie.  (By the way, I still miss the twins!)  Yet, when we go back to the past, MIB HQ still has the look from the present scenes.  Should it not look more like it did in the first MIB movie?  And there aren't too many aliens!  I mean, come on!  An Alien movie with more emphasise on time travel instead of the aliens?  And where is Frank?  I must have seen a dozen pics of a pug dog and no Frank?  Where's Frank?  And the worms!  I miss them too!  They had such a small part this time around.  I hope that they stop it here before they make it worse.  If they come out with a MIB 4, they need to get the people who did MIB 1 back so it can be good!

4736871,4,B005LAIHQS,"A fitting sequel and end (?) to the series. The original MIB was a shock to the general system. It was unique in its humor and approach for a major film. It was both silly and intelligent, bawdy and full of heart. And then they made the sequel... which shall go unmentioned. I wouldn't have thought they could return to these characters and this world either believably nor in a way that would be interesting. I was glad to be proved wrong and I would watch it again.

14 years after the last movie, we pick up J and K with a new nemesis and, of course, high stakes. But this story is highly personal without ever becoming overly sweet or maudlin. It's still a buddy cop story, but it isn't about J's learning the ropes or a simple standard fate-of-the-world scenario, it is about their lack of communication--like most long term relationships.

It is a clever story with some good CGI and, despite being filmed for 3D, there isn't an over-reliance on that medium in the filming. It works perfectly fine in 2D. It isn't quite as snappy as the first movie in its humor, but it is comfortable and fun. And the retro look of the HQ and the design, in general, was really well executed.

The most impressive aspect, frankly, was Brolin's performance as the younger K. You will swear they CG'd Jones to simply look younger. It is one of the more remarkable pieces of casting and performances where an actor has to become another actor's younger self. Much like Looper, it was done subtly. But honestly, it was also done much better in Brolin's case. They lucked out with both the physicality and the voice match for sure, but he is also a gifted mimic.

MIB3 is a reminder that sequels can be done right if given time and commitment and when they're not just created to cash in on the fervor (can you say Iron Man 2?). Here's also hoping they know when to walk away. Smith and Jones are not replaceable and the story has really run its course in a satisfying way. I'm glad they came back to wrap it all up, but I'm happy now to let them exit the stage.",1379721600,,2047,4.378947368421053

The problem is my Blu Ray player doesn't have EXACTLY the right software in it to play this movie without errors, it plays the other two, go figure. At least that's what Sony Picture Home Entertainment says. It seems there are layers of encryption that change from different developers, and reworking DVDs into Blu Ray causes mismatches with static programming of your player so your latest player may not play some old re release as it isn't an exact fit. In my case that meant backing up and restarting when the audio would magically quit. I even tried to get updates for my player from the manufacturer but they didn't have anything for the model I had.

4737136,5,B005LAIHQS,"The formula for trilogies is simple, the first one is amazing, the second one is terrible, and the third one is pretty good. Almost all trilogies seem to follow this format, but Men In Black has always played by a different set of rules and as it turns out, the third film was far and away the best of the trilogy. In this installment of MIB, the notorious Boris The Animals escapes from his prison on the Moon. This is significant, because putting Boris away is what made Agent K's career and cost Boris an arm. Boris, determined to change things, goes back in the past to kill K. Once he does, everything descends into chaos and the Earth is at risk, so Agent J, goes back in time to stop him. Once in 1969, J enters into a strange new world where he sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Josh Brolin plays the younger K and is absolutely terrific, it was amazing and hysterical how he captures and mimics every single one of Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms to a tee. Will Smith is his usual self, with his quick one liners and terrific actions scenes, he hasn't missed a beat, even all these years later. For as good as the acting in this film was, the story is even better. Watching this film it's hard to believe the story is based on a comic book, because the writing really was tremendous. They took a step back and show what MIB and it's agents were like 40 years ago, at the very beginning and it was really interesting to see. Men In Black 3 is far and away the best of the trilogy and one of Will Smith's best films in years. Science Fiction is usual a narrow genre, that isn't for everyone, but this film does have something for everyone and for that it gets the label of a can't miss movie.",1375056000,,1723,4.240121580547113

The easy going nature of Will Smith/J versus the straight-laced approach of Tommy Lee Jones/K always makes for great comedy.  Josh Brolin makes a great addition as a younger K and his performance really dovetails into TLJ, which is crucial when playing the same character at a younger age.

4737325,3,B005LAIHQS,"Being a huge fan of the original `Men in Black', I was largely disappointed with `Men in Black 2' and somewhat turned off to the idea of `Men in Black 3'.  Still, it was on and I was home and bored and decided to give it a go.  Sadly, they just cannot recapture the magic of the original film, despite getting some new blood and upping the action and effects.  Thankfully, most of the silly jokes are gone, which made for a less `eye rolling' experience than when watching `Men in Black 2'.  Still, the plot is spotty and the tacked on heartwarming ending was unnecessary.  Will Smith oozes charisma though, even when he is obviously phoning in a performance, so he's a joy to watch, and Josh Brolin absolutely NAILS his portrayal of Tommy Lee Jones.  Like, it was somewhat uncanny and I found myself completely baffled as to how I never realized he was such a great actor.  Leave it to this preposterous movie.  Michael Stuhlbarg's character is ridiculous, and he looks like Jason Biggs straight out of `Loser', and Jemaine Clement is more `gross' than `scary'.  I guess that is the whole idea here, to be gross and funny as opposed to engaging and thrilling.  It could have been funnier, it could have been tenser, it could have been better, but at least it wasn't as dreadful as the second one.",1372636800,2,1297,4.504273504273504

4737394,4,B005LAIHQS,"When a third ""Men In Black"" film was released almost 10 years after the second one, many people shrugged and asked ""why?""  In truth, ""Men in Black 3"" was a very necessary film.  It boosted the series by helping to remove the bad taste of the incoherent, and utterly irrelevant, ""Men In Black 2"".

  While ""MIB 3"" does bring back Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agents J and K, respectively, there are some notable changes.  Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away prior to this film and he is replaced by Agent O (Emma Thompson), who has a complicated history with Agent K.  When the story sends Agent J back in time, the younger versions of O and K are placed by Alice Eve and Josh Brolin (who does a perfect imitation of what you would think a young Agent K would be like).

  The main story deals with the very lethal alien, Boris the Animal (he says, ""It's just Boris!"") being sprung from a Supermax prison on the surface of the moon, after more than 40 years of incarceration.  He locates some underground technology that allows him to travel back in time, prior to his capture, and kill the young Agent K, setting the stage for his species, the Boglodites, the invade and destroy Earth decades later.

  The change in the timeline has everyone not remembering who Agent K is other than the much older agents (like O).  Yet, somehow, J was immune to the timeline change and his goal is to back in time, save K, defeat Boris and save the Earth.  Just your typical day at MIB.

  The problem with the second film was that it was riding on the coattails of the first and using familiarity with the characters and environment as a substitute for an actual plot.  I felt that way when I saw it in 2002 and subsequent viewings on cable since then have not changed my opinion.  ""MIB 3"" brought a more coherent plot, with better villains and side characters.  The end result was a much-needed shot of adrenaline that led to tremendous box office returns and a guarantee of ""MIB 4"".",1371772800,,1971,4.416666666666667

Having Agent Jay time travel back to the 60s is funny when the cops pull him over and when he gets in a fight with Aaron Warhol.

There weren't as many in this third movie and Tommy Lee Jones wasn't in it much...however, his ""younger self"" did a terrific job. I also liked the twist at the end that shows a very early connection between ""K"" and ""J"".

Most astounding performance by an actor, Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones circa 1969.  ""You know what would be good with this?  Silence.""
This is an amazing comeback, resurrecting the original feel of the franchise (after that unfortunate mistake that's wedged between the two classics).  They've certainly redeemed themselves with this entry.  This movie is packed with laughs and excitement, and, I'm not ashamed to admit, a scene on a beach that had me bawling.

Was actually very disappointed that neither he nor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (channelling Bruce Willis in ""Looper"") got noticed for awards for their brilliant work in 2012.  Also greatly enjoyed Emma Thompson's Agent O.  MiB3 has lots of interesting surprises and is a more-than-good continuation in the franchise.  Very much enjoyed the new characters (especially the aliens, though would love to have seen at least one new non-humanoid character design), and Nicole Sherzinger's hottie, Lily.  MiB is definitely on point in their own way in presenting what could very well become the sci-fi equivalent to the Bond girls, with Linda Fiorentino [Dr. Laurel Weaver] in MiB, Lara Flynn Boyle [Serleena] and Rosario Dawson [Laura] in MiB II and in this one both NIcole and Alice Eve as the youthful Agent O.

4738322,5,B005LAIHQS,This one is the best in my opinion even though I had to watch it a couple of times to completely understand the different time zones featured in the movie. Brolin's character stole the movie from Will Smith with his stone face and nicknames for Smith.  I could laugh just looking at him. The Griffin character added mystery and intrigue to the film.  I missed Frank the pug and Jake Jeebs from this release.  All in all worth watching.,1365811200,,435,4.481012658227848

I was also surprised at how original the aliens are, how well the time travel element works, and the chemistry of the younger agent K.

4738615,4,B005LAIHQS,"I picked this up because of the time travel angle, but it turned out to be a pretty fun film. It's not high art, and in fact it doesn't have anything new to say about time travel, or anything else either. It's also a ridiculous romp. A clear guilty pleasure.

We begin with a good villain: Borris the Animal. He's plenty zany and has one arm and a face hugger that lives in his remaining hand. He also has it out for Tommy Lee Jones, who locked him up 40 years earlier. When he breaks out of his lunar prison, he wants nothing more than to travel back in time and kill our taciturn hero. Which he does. Will Smith then has to head back himself and put things to right.

Josh Brolin plays ""young Agent K"" (Jones). The resemblance is uncanny, in looks, in voice, in mannerism. Jones himself isn't even in the film for more than a few minutes. There isn't any time travel paradox here. There's just hunt down the villain and try to kill him. But the film luxuriates in campy 1969 visual gags. Costumes, Andy Wharhol, the Apollo 11 launch, and so on. It's like Madmen without the drama. The rocket launch really is pretty cool.

MIB puts its money on screen. There isn't a normal shot in the whole film. Aliens abound. Not exactly realistic. The tech difference over 40 years is handled in the same over-simplified manner as in X-men first class. Everything is the same, except it was bigger then, with 60s styling. Guns: bigger. Memory eraser: bigger. Aliens, definitely bigger (and slimier).

Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire`s Arnold Rothstein) plays a very amusing four dimensional being. Defiantly found him groovy. I can't even remember the second MIB, but this one has to be better.

  I have ordered a lot of DVD's from Amazon over the years, I had a probem only once, and it was returned with no problem. This is the second bad DVD I have received from Amazon already this year, and the only one that limited the return period to less than 30 days from when I received it.

The dialogue and witty comments throughout the movie were hilarious. An engaging movie where the writers, actors, director, and producers did a wonderful job.

When I heard that MIB3 was being released, I was less than enthusiastic about watching it. MIB2 was silly, and I was not interested in watching another MIB sequel.

Well, this weekend came around, and my wife were looking for a movie to rent (IMO, there really were not many new releases worth spending cash on at the theatres). Nothing caught our eyes, so we looked up MIB3 on Amazon. The reviews were very good overall with a lot of 5 star reviews, so it got my curiosity going. We took a chance and rented it.

From the start of the movie, I was impressed. They kept a good pace throughout the movie, and it kept you interested and engaged. For the genre, it's definitely one of the best that I can recall watching recently. Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin all did a spectacular job. All their lines were delivered perfectly.

If you are looking for a good movie to watch, you won't be disappointed with MIB3. Don't let MIB2 turn you off. This movie was artfully and soulfully put together. This was my favorite of the franchise.",1362960000,,1356,4.477732793522267

I think this was better than MIB 2, but not by much. The novelty of ""Men in Black"" was refreshing, entertaining, and fun. That aside, both sequels just haven't had the magic of the first movie. Almost as though the folks involved are just trying entirely too hard to top the first movie and just somehow missed the magic. I don't know, I'm not in the movie business so I don't know what goes on or how things are done. What I do know is that the word ""lackluster"" came to mind as the ending credits began to roll.

Admittedly I bought MIB3 just to see it and partially because the reviews I read online lead me to believe it was better than the second installment, but in general I was underwhelmed. I'm going to watch it again at some point and will update this review if there's a change in opinion.",1362787200,,959,4.211956521739131

4739066,5,B005LAIHQS,"Aliens are about the bombard the Earth into extinction, and the only hope for the world is Agent J (Will Smith). He has to travel back in time to the 1960's to save a much-younger Agent K (Josh Brolin) from death at the hands of a time-traveling alien before Agent K can obtain protective, alien technology to shield the world from alien attack.

This whole series is a real hoot. I've greatly enjoyed all three films, including this one. Will Smith is terrific, as always, but Tommy Lee Jones has a much smaller part in this third installment, and I did miss him as a co-star of the movie. However, Josh Brolin does a great job playing the younger version of Agent K.

A particular standout in the film for me was the New Zealand comedic actor Jemaine Clement (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-the-Conchords/dp/B003L7DK74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of the Conchords</a>) who plays the villain, Boris, a motorcycle-riding alien with horrible eyes and teeth.

This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together--though it might be a bit scary for children under the age of 10 or so.",1362268800,,1145,5.145161290322581
4739067,3,B005LAIHQS,If only for how hilarious Josh Brolin deadpans the younger Tommy Lee Jones. Action is only so-so. Will Smith uninspired. Villain very weak,1362268800,,138,5.043478260869565

4739069,5,B005LAIHQS,"The original Men in Black film was, well, original  a clever, funny, and ultimately satisfying sci-fi romp by three excellent actors (Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Rip Torn). Lamentably, for fans of the first film, men in black II was little more than a remake of the first film with slightly different peripheral characters and a female villain rather than a male one.

Men in Black III returns two of the three original actors (Rip Torn was replaced by Emma Thompson) but adds a fourth  sort of  a younger version of K, the character played by Tommy Lee Jones (Josh Brolin). Since MIB III involves time travel (and the tricky paradox of going back in time to alter the future) the parsing of one character does not seem particularly unusual, and actually adds to the charm of the film. Moreover, although MIB III reprises the theme of I and II (saving Earth from from a psychopathic alien) the story is quite different and very entertaining. Best of all, except for a few minor touches that are largely unnecessary to understanding the story, MIB III works quite well as a standalone story, independent of the two previous versions.

One final comment: for those of you having 3-D viewing capabilities, the 3-D version of the film is absolutely stunning.

A couple minor criticisms could be added. Tommy Lee Jones is a bit long in the tooth to be playing an action hero, even an aging one, and Will Smith occasionally gives the impression he is playing a parody of his character in the previous films. That having been said, it is altogether good fun throughout, and a worthy addition to the franchise.",1362182400,,1606,4.697508896797153

4739123,4,B005LAIHQS,MIB has hopefully seen it's last chapter in the franchise. I loved the first 2 and I liked this one as well but it felt tired. The same jokes and considerably more exaggerated takes on the characters. Jemaine Clement however saved this movie from 3 stars for me.

His review was not enough action, it was all story, boring  I looked at my wife and we both cracked up, a movie with a story, how terrible.

I enjoyed the fact that there is a storyline and you learn more about the relationship between the 2 main characters.

Josh Brolin played a young Agent K for most of the film. The scenes in 1969 feel like a Mad Men episode. There are some plot holes and the theme song by Pitbull is a little bland. The Men in Black movies have a lighter tone than the Men in Black comic books created by Lowell Cunningham. In the comic books, the Men in Black killed innocent people, fought werewolves, and Agent J was a white, Caucasian man! Men in Black 3 is worth watching with some popcorn, candy, and soft drinks.",1361750400,,636,4.308333333333334

Besides being thoroughly grossed out a couple of times and tempted to shut it off and switch to something else, we stayed with it to the end.  We struggled to stay connected to the film throughout, however.  There was a lot more dialog and the witty comebacks between the main characters just seemed to fall short of their mark.  The actors were excellent and did their best, but this version was a bit of a disappointment.  There was action, but the tempo or pace of the film seemed off.  The special effects were incredible, as expected.

4739359,5,B005LAIHQS,"The original MEN IN BLACK was memorable because it was a quirky sci-fi movie that had just the right balance of comedy and action. MEN IN BLACK 2 followed in that same vein, but the film wasn't as strong and felt more like a retread. MEN IN BLACK 2 was released in 2002 and a decade later (due to script issues, scheduling conflicts, and budget problems), the boys are back in MEN IN BLACK 3 and while the film isn't as funny as the original, it's a far superior film to MEN IN BLACK 2.

The film begins on the lunar prison base, a maximum security facility that was specifically designed to hold Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement who seems to be channeling Tim Curry), the last member of a species of creatures that's sole purpose was destroying and devouring other civilizations. Boris has been in prison for forty years and what he really wants is to travel back through time and kill the man responsible for his imprisonment and the loss of his arm: Agent K. Through some stealth planning, Boris escapes.

Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) still work for the top-secret organization that protects the Earth from intergalactic threats. Events during the past few days convince K that Boris is out to kill him. While that's true, K is mistaken on just when Boris plans to commit his crime. After fighting Boris, K & J have an argument of sorts. The next morning, J awakens and discovers that all signs of K have been erased. He soon learns that K was killed forty years earlier. J has to travel back through time to 1969 and prevent the younger K (Josh Brolin) from being killed.

There will be some who will be disappointed by MEN IN BLACK 3 because though there are plenty of jokes and lots of humor, the film isn't as funny as the original film. However, what makes the movie a better film that MEN IN BLACK 2 is the characterization and a script full of pathos, not to mention plenty of action.

MEN IN BLACK 3 focuses on the relationship between K & J. The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.

Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K. Brolin is a great actor. I've been impressed with him time and time again since first seeing him in THE GOONIES. His resemblance to Tommy Lee Jones is uncanny. Also notable in the movie is the portrayal of Michael Stuhlbarg as the last of another alien species who is capable of existing in multiple dimensions of space and time at the same time.

MEN IN BLACK 3 isn't as funny or action-packed as MEN IN BLACK, but it is a far superior movie than MEN IN BLACK 2. It's highly entertaining and makes me glad to that the men in black are back.",1361491200,,3172,4.4229452054794525

4739528,5,B005LAIHQS,"I loved this movie and bought it in HD. It's as brilliant as the first two but yes, different enough so that it doesn't feel like a repeat of the first 2. My husband didn't like it as much as the first two but that's only because he doesn't like to see ""drama"" in sci-fi as much as ""monsters"". NOT that this was a drama! It was funny, smart, beautiful, with a convincingly evil ""Boris the Monster"" as the thing to overthrow and a totally unexpected ending that answered a couple of major questions: why doesn't K ever smile, and where did J come from, besides NYC?
If you enjoyed the first 2 movies, watch the third. It's worth it.",1361318400,,631,4.266666666666667

4739583,5,B005LAIHQS,"""Men in Black 3"" is fantastic; much better than the first 2 movies in the story and the characters involved.  The story dealing with how Will Smith's character, J, becomes more bonded with Tommy Lee Jones's character, K, is great story telling.  And Josh Brolin's interpretation of Tommy Lee Jones's character, K, is fantastic.  Its too bad that there couldn't have been a female agent, such as L in the story, but maybe in ""Men in Black 4(?).  Anyway, another reminder; if anyone is looking for a fantastic and comedic look at how certain individuals are protecting our planet need look no further than this movie",1361145600,,614,4.764150943396227

After 15 years Will Smith is still being surprised, befuddled and exasperated by his partner, Tommy Lee Jones. This time Will has to go back in time to save his partner's life. Boris the alien gets creepier as the movie goes along. Kudos to the CGI people for incorporating the eewww factor. Josh Brolin gives a stellar performance as K the Younger. His mimicking of Tommy's voice, accent and mannerisms is downright spooky. Michael Stuhlbarg is a sweet and funny alien in this movie.

4739773,5,B005LAIHQS,"The original Men in Black was a brilliant, witty film, with astounding effects, fine acting, and a wonderful sense of humor. The second film in the series came close to the original, but the third might even pass it by. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their performances from the first two films, and  Josh Brolin puts in a fantastic performance as a young Agent K- he's got all of Jones' mannerisms and speech patterns down, and he even looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones.

All the effects and the imaginative creatures that made the first two movies so much fun are still there, and the plot and dialogue are every bit as good as anything in the first two movies. This time, we're looking into the history of the MIB, the history of the 1960s, the space program, and the history of agents J and K as well. This is a delightful movie that will leave you feeling happy and perhaps longing for an MIB 4.",1360886400,,909,4.372781065088757

it was weird how good he was, I told my husband I thought Josh played a better Tommy Lee than Tommy Lee did...he was that good.  For this price, you could watch over and over or gift it to someone or a library...if you go to the theatre to see it you will
spend more than the price of this for 2 to get in!  A good flick.",1360713600,,570,3.896551724137931

I was pleasantly surprised how well-balanced and mature MIB III was, but fun enough to make my 11 year-old son say (""this was my favorite one!"").

I don't think anyone ever considered Men in Black to be a trilogy, but the way they scripted this third episode, it definitely could be considered one (although you can skip MIB II and not miss a beat).

The acting is excellent. Will Smith continues to entertain, Tommy Lee Jones continues to ""stone-face"" his way into a personality, and Josh Brolin is a perfect TLJ in his younger days.

If you want to enjoy the fun and action of the first MIB, with great character development and acting, you won't be disappointed in this third chapter.",1360713600,,825,4.598639455782313

While I understand trying to protect their product from piracy, obviously I purchased it, I'm not the bad guy, I paid for my copy and I should not have to download and additional app or program to use something that I paid for.

4739958,4,B005LAIHQS,"Initially, I was a bit skeptical as to the quality of this movie. When I began watching it, the signature, goofy presentation seemed as though it had not aged well since the long past days of the original MIB, and the time traveling plot looked as though it was a disaster of corniness waiting to happen. Fortunately, I suspended judgment, and continued watching MIB3, and I was pleasantly surprised that it became an engaging, heartfelt, fun romp through some of the weirder and wilder corners of science fiction.

I particularly enjoyed the use of the moon launch as the central plot point in this movie, and I felt that this significant moment in human history was implemented brilliantly. The exploration of J and K's relationship was surprisingly moving and well done, with a performance by Josh Brolin that steals Smith's not-inconsiderable thunder at times. The two of them work together quite well, but this should come as no surprise, given their talents and professionalism. The creation of ""Boris the Animal"" was a great accomplishment for the creature team of this movie, and he stands out as a truly interesting (and a bit scary!) villain.

Finally, I was pleased to see the criminally underused Will Arnett and Bill Hayder receive some face time in MIB3... I won't spoil the nature of Hayer's role, but it was hilarious!",1360540800,,1334,4.898230088495575

4740066,4,B005LAIHQS,"I always worry about the longevity of a series over time and if it can sustain its primary objective: making it fun to watch without overburdening it with plot and trying too hard. Do the actors still have chemistry and does the plot keep your eyes glued, no matter what? Needless to say, the last MIB wasn't that great, adding too much and too many new characters so I was hesitant to watch this one.

In MIB3, what is pretty much a franchise re-boot, they went back to basics and kept it between K and J about their unique interaction. Smith and Jones have not lost their edge. This time 'round, it's time travel and visiting a young K and stopping an invasion...again.

There's really nothing to dislike. Honestly. The plot was well written and tight. There was a surprising level of depth I really didn't expect but this franchise has always managed to have enough of it without getting mushy. No answers left unanswered. You learn a few more interesting things about the mysterious K. It had cool gadgets, a few alien ick factors and it didn't try to do too much. It's over the top enough with the ET element and it was nice to have a throwback, where the tech isn't so in your face. No part was hokey, it was tongue-in-cheek and fresh.

James Brolin was the PERFECT young K. I mean, he really looks like he could have been Tommy Lee Jones' son in real life. He got Jones' mannerisms, chemistry, just everything down pat. Smith and Jones themselves, well, unsurprisingly they did awesome and I can't wait for the next MIB!",1360540800,,1527,4.505415162454874

4740279,5,B005LAIHQS,They did an awesome job on all of these movies. Most of the time any movies they make a number 2 or 3 to are lame and annoying but these seem to get better and better. This was by far my FAVORITE I absolutely loved it and so did the family!!!,1360022400,,242,3.764705882352941

4740319,3,B005LAIHQS,"Ok  our 5 year old loved it but this installment of MIB3 is not as kid friendly as the previous two.  The villain caused my 5 year old to jump a bit, but after sliding a little closer to mom, proceeded to watch the rest of the movie without a problem .  The opening and ending scenes might be a little too much for kids in the mid range..most of it flew right over the 5 y/o's head but If I were to suggest it to another parent probably 8-10 years old , depending on the kid , is a more appropriate age.",1359936000,,503,3.8640776699029127

Will Smith is fabulous and charming and funny--as always--and Josh Brolin is completely amazing as a younger K! Talk about channeling TLJ and K! Wow!
The story was clever, the character development and furthering of J and K's characters and their relationship was sweet and satisfying, and it was just an all around great movie!",1359936000,,460,4.621951219512195

4740326,5,B005LAIHQS,This is the third film in this series which is the brain-child of Steven Spielberg.  This time the story line becomes even more personal and private revolving around an alien escape and a possible death of one of the agents.  Time travel is utilized to try and correct this problem.  This installment provides the audience with a more personal and humanistic approach in the relationship between the two agents.  HUMAN NATURE WILL ALWAYS BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF ANY RELATIONSHIP!

My problem is that I am a loyal customer and I have never experienced any issue before. I don't know if ""cheated"" is the actual term that I would use for this event, but I did not receive what I paid for and that being the movie that I requested and paid for... I would like to see the movie without having to pay for it again. Right is right,.. Right?!?!/",1359849600,,504,4.05
4740407,5,B005LAIHQS,This is a awesome movie i was so excited to see that they kept all the original actors and filmmakers on this movie. i will have to admit i thought that this one was better than 2. but i like all three of them. this was one of my top movies to see in theaters last year. but i didn't get around to it. i was very happy with the way they did the film. it had an excellent storyline. i will have to say this it would of not been a men in black movie without will smith or tommy lee jones. and i was impressed on how josh brolin played k hed did an excellent job portraying tommy lee jones. i hope they do another one. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1359849600,,671,3.8

4740410,5,B005LAIHQS,"After the debacle that was MIB II, I was understandably skeptical about this one. Will Smith brings his A game as agent J, Brolin does an uncanny Tommy Lee Jones impersonation, and the movie even finds some heart at the end.

4740412,2,B005LAIHQS,"This release of MIB attempts to develop some human interaction between the two protagonists.  However, it's clumsily done and simply not interesting.

4740414,5,B005LAIHQS,"This movie for me started out and ran like the ones before, and I enjoyed the viewing.  I thought all of the situations leading into the body of the plot were funny, fit right into the theme of MIB until they dropped the plot bomb at the end.

Package was handled with great care and the DVD still had plastic on it like you would find in the store. No dings, dents, scratches or tears in product, packaging, and even came with a receipt that was nicely folded. I had propmt service with a tracking number that was included so I could track its where abouts through the shipping process. I had standard shipping, and I recieved this item in three days. Thats including the day I ordered which was late at night, the next day, and the day I recieved the package. I received the item through USPS. Will definatly recommend them in the future and will buy from them again. Thank you for the happy memories to come and for the great experiance as well. BTW I ordered the Men in Black 3 movie DVD format and I heard this is suppose to be an excellent movie. My friend who hardly goes to the movie theater saw this movie and even recommended it as well.

4740512,4,B005LAIHQS,I thought this movie didn't miss a beat from the previous Men in Black movies.  Josh Brolin nailed his impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones and the chemistry between Jones and Will Smith as well as Smith and Brolin was great.,1359676800,,221,4.525

That said, I liked it a lot, and particularly appreciated how they accommodated the many-year gap in the story. It does tend to be ""the Will Smith show"" to a greater extent than were the earlier installments, but I found that to work out ok.

Josh Brolin did a great job as K, and the story was entertaining, if a bit on the predictable side.  There were a few surprises, but also a few places where you are almost reciting the script before the characters are.

Josh Brolin does a fab job at playing a young Tommy Lee Jones.  Tommy Lee Jones does a great job at playing himself.  Will Smith is cool and gorgeous, as always.  Jeanine Clement as Boris the Animal is the BEST bad guy so far.  And I loved Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, the all-knowing alien.

This law is immutable, though as with all laws, there are exceptions (""Star Wars:  The Empire Strikes Back,"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" spring immediately to mind);  however, MiB3 is not one.  MiB3 has the feel of being made up as it goes along -- which, from what I understand about the production, is not far from the truth:  filming began before a finished script.  Will Smith is game, and Josh Brolin damn near steals the show, but Tommy Lee Jones has basically an extended cameo, to the detriment of the entire movie, and nowhere in sight are the wacky aliens from 1 and 2 (no Jeebs or anyone).  MiB3 just is not nearly as much fun as the classic first and the reviled second;  it distills J's and K's relationship, tells some interesting back story, but without the zany tone and madcap aliens of the previous ones it feels flat and forced.

On the plus side, I really liked the Griffin character, and his quantum abilities to see multiple outcomes/realities at once. That made for fun cinema, and was the best part of the movie for me. However, the old characters felt stale, and because the plot involves a shift back in time (I don't want to go into too much detail so as not to spoil it), Tommy Lee Jones is not in a large chunk of it, since his younger self is played by Josh Brolin. And although Josh Brolin is good as the young Agent K, I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Will Smith was as strong as it is between Jones and Smith (and that was such a big part of the earlier movies.) I also felt the director went a little overboard with the gooey, gross special effects, and that this also took time away from the 'buddy movie' dynamic that made the first two so successful. There were funny moments to be sure, and if you were a fan of the first two you'll enjoy this one too, but 3, 3 1/2 stars at best for me.",1358812800,,1078,4.162679425837321

I was not a huge fan of the first two movies.  The first one was good, second was pretty blah.  I went in to watching this with zero expectations.  I was not expecting to be entertained because sequels and the like usually suck.

However, I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging and well written the storyline was.  I was not rolling on the floor laughing, but I was interested in what was going on.  Right before they meet Griffin I was started to lose interest and started to doze off, but it picked up after that.

I was immensely surprised and I would watch it again, which is more than I can say for the second one.  Still not sure if I understood the chocolate milk thing and almost falling asleep somewhere in the middle where it slowed a little was why I only gave it four stars, but all in all I thought it was worth watching and I would recommend it to a friend.",1358726400,,896,4.254437869822485

4741392,5,B005LAIHQS,I genuinely enjoyed this Men in Black 3 movie.  The movie just works on so many levels. I enjoyed each character so much.  The story was tight and funny.  The story had sufficient plot twists to keep it fresh and interesting.  The story revealed why Agent K behaved as he did.  Best of all Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) revealed Agent K to be a real stand up guy.  This will have to be one of my shortest reviews because; I simply do not want to give away any of the plot in the movie since I enjoyed it so much I won't spoil it for others.  I will say the picture and sound quality of the blue ray was excellent.  As we all know just because; the format is blue ray does not mean the video transfer is always first rate.  In this case the video transfer resulted in a crisp clear transfer where the colors were alive and vibrant.  I watched the movie on a 55 inch screen at 240 MHz refresh rate and the movie was just awesome.  The acting was awesome.  The dialogue was snappy.  Again you must remember that I personally love the MIB franchise so it would be hard for it to disappoint me that said I still rank this as one of the top twenty five pictures that I love.  I am over 50 years old so I have seen some great pictures accounting for the large list of great movies I have seen.  My purchase of Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) is one I do not regret in the least and I am happy to add it to my MIB collection.,1358553600,,1503,4.013468013468014

4741449,5,B005LAIHQS,We really enjoyed watching Men in Black 3 as a family.  Gave us many loaughs and was interesting to boot!,1358467200,,105,4.25

4741452,5,B005LAIHQS,I love MIB movies. I love that fact that I could purchase this for less money than at other retailers.,1358467200,,102,4.15
4741453,3,B005LAIHQS,I though that the story was too small in scope.  All the characters were too interconnected.  Effects can't carry the whole film.,1358467200,,129,4.818181818181818
4741454,4,B005LAIHQS,Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as usual. Josh Brolin is right on as the younger K. Nice twist to the story.,1358467200,,117,3.9166666666666665
4741455,5,B005LAIHQS,This was the best since the first one.  It was a very funny and made being sick bearable.  I would strongly recommend this movie.,1358467200,,129,4.333333333333333

4741516,5,B005LAIHQS,"This was a really good movie in my opinion. If you are a fan of the two previous ""Men In Black"" movies you will not be disappointed with this one!",1358380800,,146,3.9
4741517,4,B005LAIHQS,"MIB3 is worthwhile seeing but its not a funny, or action packed like on the previous two movies. The original had more to offer, however the special effects in MIB3 made up for it and was enjoyable",1358380800,,197,4.351351351351352
4741518,5,B005LAIHQS,"I  could  be wrong, but this film had the feel of the last in the series, though it was the best. The time travel portion and hints made for interesting watching. Josh Brolin did a good job playing a younger K and watching the 60's storyline was different. It did answer some things concerning the relationship and why's between J and K. I liked it and suggest it.",1358380800,,364,4.338235294117647
4741519,5,B005LAIHQS,"Just love these movies and the idea of an international police force watching out for visitors getting up to mischief and protecting the Earth, especially this movie which fills in the blanks so to speak about one of the main characters. This has been one good movie to watch.",1358380800,,276,4.653061224489796
4741520,4,B005LAIHQS,"Although I was disappointed we didn't get as much Tommy Lee Jones in this movie, Josh Brolin did an excellent job portraying a younger version of him. Overall, the movie was very funny and kept me engaged. I give it four stars because it's definitely one that I would watch again.",1358380800,,280,4.509803921568627
4741521,5,B005LAIHQS,This is just as great as the 1st 2 MIB's. We love it. Plus it finshes our MIB collection. Until they make another.,1358380800,,114,4.0
4741522,5,B005LAIHQS,"Just had to get this to finish up my MB collection, of course I don't think its as good as the first two, but other people I speak to do. I just love the dog in the first two and more aliens so... anyway still an AWESOME movie. 5 stars !",1358380800,,237,3.6666666666666665

4741524,4,B005LAIHQS,"Why? Because like eateries, my opinion is based on my taste, background, persuasions, etc. For the review to be truly valid, we likely have to share the same experiences, likes and dislikes. That said, I liked this movie, though not as well as the first one. It was kind of the same ol stuff, cast of characters and plot lines, but this time with a little twist.  I though the bad guy was a little boring and overdone, the plot a little thin, but overall I was entertained. I was particularly moved by the ending scenes which seperated this one from the rest in the series. I particularly enjoyed Josh Brolin's young characterzation of a young Agent K, really quite convincing.
I liked it, but that's only my opinion.",1358380800,,717,4.558139534883721

4741635,4,B005LAIHQS,I really liked all MIBs but this one imo was the best one yet. I liked that they also really tell the back story to both agents too! Definitely worth renting!,1358294400,,158,4.129032258064516

4741643,3,B005LAIHQS,"I really liked the prequels to this movie, but I guess I was young when I saw them or their content was more mature, because this movie felt very geared towards children. Not bad, though.",1358208000,,187,4.371428571428571

4741686,5,B005LAIHQS,"This movie was great! After the disapointment of the 2nd movie, I was a little wary about it. I got this movie for my dad for Christmas who loved it and I watched it and it was really good. It ranks right up there with the first one, it was so awesome!! The story was fun, writing was good and the acting was fabulous. LOVE LOVE LOVE.",1358208000,,334,4.0

4741688,5,B005LAIHQS,"Very good movie. They managed to pull it off again, just as entertaining as #1 & 2. Not too keen on current movie ""music videos"" just replaying a bunch of scenes out of the movie. But I guess everyone is cutting corners these days to save a buck.",1358208000,,246,4.145833333333333
4741689,5,B005LAIHQS,I think this is the best one yet. Josh Brolin could be Tommy Lee's son.......This one is great and maybe there will be another one.,1358208000,,131,4.28
4741690,3,B005LAIHQS,"I love the the first two MIB movies, they were great! Full of of lots of action and very good storylines. This, however, wasn't all that good. I thought the storyline was blah! Had some low budget looking monters and was just kinda of boring.",1358208000,,242,4.4
4741691,5,B005LAIHQS,"Fun movie,very entertaining . Great addition to the Men In Black series. Brolin as a young Tommy Lee Jones was spot on!",1358208000,,119,4.454545454545454
4741692,5,B005LAIHQS,This was awesome. Makes up in every way for the second film. I can't think of a single complaint. Just great. I hope they don't make another one because this would be a beautiful end to the franchise.,1358121600,,200,4.2894736842105265
4741693,3,B005LAIHQS,"This title?  Yeah, it's what I say when I didn't hate a movie but didn't quite like it either.  Can't deny that Brolin did an amazing job and it feels like Will Smith just doesn't age, haha.",1358121600,,190,4.108108108108108

4741746,2,B005LAIHQS,JB did a nice job of imitating TLJ but beyond that the movie was flat.  My time would have been better spent watching something else.,1358121600,,133,4.32

4741748,5,B005LAIHQS,"MIB 3 is as funny as it is fun. The natural chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is spectacular. Jones (K) is so laconic, that he is the perfect foil for Smith (J), talkative, observant, hilarious. I don't know how Tommy Lee Jones kept a deadpan face during scenes; there must have been a lot of out-takes. Also, full marks to ""the young agent K"", an astounding performance. MIB 3 focuses on the relationship between the two agents, with a hair-raising back story, and the payoff is sublime.
Unless somebody spoils the ending, you won't see the finale twist coming.",1358121600,4,577,4.666666666666667

Recently we had company over and my son wound up watching it with all of us on amazon streaming. My wife & I enjoyed it as much as our 1st viewing, and our son really liked it. Good, fun and frequently funny dialogue. Josh Brolin really becomes Tommy Lee Jones. Decent story.

4742062,4,B005LAIHQS,"With so many remakes and sequels being made these days it's nice to have some being made that are actually well done. More often than not these types of films are rushed into production and rarely come close to being as original or fun as the first films. Such is not the case with MEN IN BLACK 3.

Believe it or not it's been 10 years since the last film in this series. Agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) are still cleaning up alien disasters on Earth and saving mankind even though mankind has no clue that it's going on. The head of their organization, Zed, has passed away and the memorial for him is less than, well, memorable. J still can't get K to open up. And then a crisis happens.

At the prison facility on the moon, the worst scum of outer space has broken loose. Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped. Captured and put in this prison as well as having his arm shot off by K 40 years ago, Boris wants nothing more than revenge. His plan is to escape, get back to Earth and go back in time to make sure K never gets past their original meeting.

All of this happens with the exception of J remembering K like nothing has changed. When he goes to work, no one there understands why he thinks K is his partner since K was killed 40 years earlier. That is until he talks to O (Emma Thompson). She realizes that time has been altered. When an attack on Earth by Boris and the rest of the group from his planet begins, J must go back in time to make sure that he doesn't have the chance to alter things thus saving not only the world by K as well.

The first thing that makes this work so well is the story. It's not a rehash of past films and gives us something new to consider. It also allows the closeness between the two partners be developed a little more. While K displays nothing, deep down you catch glimpses of his fondness for J.

The second thing that makes this movie click is the performance by Josh Brolin as the young K. Not only does his appearance almost uncannily like that of Jones, he has his mannerisms and speech patterns down to a T. At times you might find yourself thinking that this is indeed a young Tommy Lee Jones and wonder how they were actually able to go back in time to get him for this part. But the fact is it's just that great of a performance by Brolin.

Both Jones and Smith play their roles like there's been no time between the last film and this one. Jones continues to offer the most deadpan of stoic faces and Smith has the sarcastic quick wit of Agent J down like it's his normal way of behaving.

Once again the special effects are fantastic and will have you pausing the DVD to get a better glimpse of each and every alien. Some seem to look familiar and others new, but each one is original and helps to create a realistic look for the encounters they have with the agents.

More than anything this movie offers you a lot of fun. It's not as serious as the topic might sound even though any invasion of Earth by another life form from space would be quite serious. The laughs come easily and the drama that underlies the whole story, J's closeness and attachment to K, make it a complete story. If you want entertainment when renting, or buying, this week then you won't go wrong with this one.",1357776000,,3270,4.237560192616372

Even though this movie is MIB 3, it is able to stand alone without having seen the first two MIB movies. Plenty of action and the great play between Agent J and Agent K makes this movie a very enjoyable experience. My only complaint was the lack of interaction with Frank the pug dog agent. He would have been great with Emma Thompson's character. But overall, it was an enjoyable movie to watch and worth the rental fee.

Needlessness to say, I was surprised and found it to be quite good, even better than the second film. And, I do felt that this film can stand on its own without having to watch any of the earlier films. The most surprisingly to me was how Josh Brolin was able to portray the ""young"" Agent K so well and so convincing that I actually stood up in my room and applauded him for that.

We liked the writing, the chemistry of the characters, and especially Josh Brolin's frighteningly accurate take on a young Tommy Lee Jones. I didn't even miss the worms or the bugs from the earlier films. And the 70s sets were so spot-on I kept thinking things like, ""...they must have raided my mother's basement for that TV set...""

The humor is weaker and while Josh Brolin does a great job as a younger Tommy Lee, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both show their age. It's not their actual physical age but instead that their performance just seems tired.

If you're a MIB fan, the movie is worth buying - just don't have super expectations.

4742358,4,B005LAIHQS,"When Men in Black came out in 1997, I was thirteen. Will Smith was a huge box office star (and he arguably still is), and his rap career was about to explode thanks to his album, Big Willie Style (1997). When I first saw Men in Black, I was a huge fan. I was impressed with the creative story and willingness to accept the absurdity of dealing with aliens. It was refreshing, funny, and entertaining. Then, in 2002, the less enjoyable sequel came out. It was still a box office success but not as widely regarded or enjoyed as the original.

Fast forward to 2012. Men in Black 3 seems like a logical film to finish a trilogy, but it also doesn't seem necessary. The teenager in me was more than excited to see MIB3, but my expectations weren't that high. However, as soon as the movie ended, I walked out of the theater incredibly impressed.

Men in Black 3 takes place fourteen years after the original. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and  Agent J (Will Smith) are still partners. K is still old, cranky, and by the book. J is still the fun, sarcastic, ambitious, and unpredictable agent. The relationship between K and J worked fifteen years ago, and it still does. In fact, their relationship is the crux of the whole film.

The film begins with an elaborate prison break from Lunar Max, the super-high security prison for alien criminals on the moon. Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) is regarded as the most dangerous prisoner there and, of course, is the first to escape. Boris has a magical little creature that lives in his hand and shoots an unlimited number of bone spikes, thus providing him with plenty of ammunition. He is hell-bent on escaping the Moon in order to have revenge on K for shooting his arm off forty years ago and putting him in prison.

It's a simple enough plot and a wonderfully absurd reason for Boris' evil motivations. Boris escapes back to Earth and seeks out the ability to travel back in time to kill K before he shoots his arm off. This is where the film really hits its stride. In a touching scene, K attempts to talk to an angry J about some universal secrets he hasn't shared yet. J is furious that these secrets still exist after being partners with K for fourteen years. After J discontinues their conversation, K awaits a fight with Boris. But the fight never comes, and K literarily vanishes on the screen.

With Boris successfully killing K in the past, J must go back to 1969 (when K dies) to save him and the world. Back in 1969, young K (Josh Brolin) is a fun loving, young, hotshot agent. Brolin masterfully captures the character of K but still adds his personal touches. He isn't as cranky, and there are moments of true emotion. J's ongoing joke is always, ""What happened to you?"" Because of the sophistication of the relationship between the young K and J, the film offers more than just popcorn- and explosion-fodder entertainment. It actually creates something more important: a character-based film with people you actually care about.

Without going into details, the climax of the movie is exciting, thrilling, and heartbreaking. The consequences redefine the entire trilogy for the characters. In fact the climax of Men in Black 3 makes the first film even better and will only improve it with repeated viewings of the trilogy.

From a geek perspective, Men in Black 3 is also one of the single best examples of the depiction of time travel in recent films. The cause and effect consequences of meddling with time are all apparent, thought out, and used perfectly in various parts of the film. It's an almost realistic take on time travel. There are no apparent time paradoxes created, and it's not a plot that is challenging to ponder within its various timelines.

Director Barry Sonnenfeld has been hit or miss in his career (mostly hit), but he nails it here. His vision for color and character contrast is his masterstroke, and this is one of his best achievements yet as a director.

Men In Black 3 is by far the best of the trilogy and a wonderful way to end the series (hopefully, but unlikely). Yes, it's a great popcorn, summer blockbuster, but thanks to a creative, funny, and entertaining screenplay, it has the makings of a film to be much appreciated long after its theatrical release.",1357603200,,4255,4.63129973474801

4743154,5,B005LAIHQS,"Is the third of a series a sequel or a threequel? And does a threequel have to be bad, especially if the sequel disappointed?

In this time line and reality (you have to see MIB III to get the joke I just made), MIB III is definitely a hit and does not disappoint. It exceeded all my expectations and that's my favorite reality of all. (again, you have to see MIB III to get my joke). We need some history to understand why.

My History with MIB:

I was captivated by the original Men In Black. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jone as K and Will Smith as J was remarkable, and the story line was tremendous fun. Here was a sci-fi adventure with lots of fancy looking gadgets, insanely complex aliens, a nasty yet hysterical villain, a ton of comedy and a happy ending -- proving that a sci-fi movie doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, horror, gore, and filled with pessimistic technobabble about the hopelessness of the future, or endless wars with evil slimy aliens intent on destroying humanity, with the humans only winning at a tremendous cost.  Here, humanity was the good guys and we won. It was brilliant.

I wasn't so excited by the sequel, MIB II. The chemistry between Jones and Smith was still there, the aliens were there, as were the fancy gadgets and sets, but it just didn't quite come off for me. It seemed, well, tired. The ending wasn't so happy, and though there were jokes a plenty, it had a much darker mood than the original. It was the lightness of the original that made it for me. The sequel seemed too forced and was just not that great.

Happily, along comes the threequel, MIB III, and it has it all again. In some ways, it's the best of the lot.

Why I enjoyed it so much:

Will Smith is again brilliant as J. He had kept in-character throughout the series and delivers his lines spot on. The jokes are fast and furious, and his expressions and body language are wonderful to watch. He makes the character fun.

Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as K, and like Smith is very consistent. He's also a delight, and as sour as K ever was, but in this film, we find out why. He's not on screen that much, but when he is, he's great. Now he has some serious competition!

A few ""newcomers"" appear who are definitely worth mentioning.

Emma Thompson as O, the new leader after Z has passed on (we don't know why he died) is excellent as a leader of the MIB. She's always just plain fun to watch. Her character is quick, and just a bit silly.

Josh Brolin appears as the younger K (yes, this film is all about time travel and paradoxes, it can make your head spin) and carries the role off by making it his own. To be honest, I didn't know the full cast when I started watching and was partly convinced that Brolin was actually Pierce Brosnan (they look a little alike and some of Brolin's mannerisms reminded me of him). Brolin's K is a much more approachable agent of the MIB, just as funny and wise as Jone's K, but in a more human way. He's also just plain fun to watch. It looks like he's enjoying the part he plays.

Michael Stuhlbarg almost steals the show as Griffin, the friendly alien who can see all possible futures and works with K and J to stop the villain and save the day (and the Earth from invasion). He is so animated, his eyes are so bright and his facial expressions are so open... he's an easy candidate for my favorite alien. Great actor.

While it's easy to like the ""good guys"", they won't stand out much as characters unless they are up against a read baddie. And this MIB has a villain even more amazing than the original MIB I (remember the cockroach guy, hysterical but also menacing)?

Hats off to Jemaine Clement as Boris, The Animal (actually a sort of hybrid of several alien animals in one body). He's really scary and dangerous, bent on destruction - not a complex villain with angst, he just wants to change history so his race can invade and eat the Earth - and he's pretty much unstoppable.

So here we have a great cast (there are others to mention, I didn't see any performance I didn't like). Do we have a great story?

The Story:

I can't put in any spoilers here, it would not be fair. Suffice it to say that while the story uses a number of tried and true sci-fi cliche's, it does it with a freshness that is brilliant. They put in just the right twists on the tried and true, spin it in a different direction that it kept me on my toes while watching the film, guessing, but never correctly, what was going on or what would happen next. The script and writing on this movie is top notch.

There are jokes a plenty as one would expect, and they come fast and furious. I had to rewind and watch several segments repeatedly to savor them all.

A few things about the story really stand out. They manage to get suspense not only because of the plot twists, but also from some extremely uncomfortable (for me anyway) visual effects.

If you get an adrenalin rush from very high places without a net, you'll love some of the scenes in this movie. How they filmed it has me wondering! This makes not only are some of the alien bits ""edge of your seat"" stuff, but also some of the action sequences -- just what you'd want in an action adventure. And they don't look faked, at least, not to me! Using height to excite the audience is nothing new, but this movie does it with more of a roller coaster effect.

The script is also very strong on heart.

As one character says to J (I paraphrase here) ""You must really love the guy to go through this for him"". And that's what we get a lot of in this movie - heart. J is devoted to K as his partner. He's got his back and will do anything for him. More than that, the younger K is open to J's devotion and accepts it without curmudgeon (as we expect from the older K). But he also is a hero and must do what he must do, in spite of the risks. He can't let J's devotion stop him from fulfilling his destiny. The relationship is very touching.

Griffin, the alien, brings a sense of wisdom to all the adventure. He delivers some very wonderful lines, memorable and touching.

There is nothing particularly shocking in the film, just great suspense and action, plenty of surprises and the greatest surprise comes at the end of the movie.

The writers set us up for one ""reality"", but what plays out is something completely different, totally unexpected, and so amazingly well done that it ties up the entire K-J relationship together in a single, poignant scene. Everything makes sense, but it comes at a surprising cost for the characters, and our emotions.

Sets and Scenery:

MIB III delivers here as well, with some oddities.

The set for the MIB HQ in our present day has been upgraded. Unfortunately, the HQ now looks like it was designed by APPLE engineers. Everything is white, silver and glass with very little color anywhere. Yes, this contrasts with the ""black"" of Men In Black, but I would have enjoyed the HQ being less ""Applish"". Apple is a great company, but why does it have to be imitated in so many sci-fi movies (i.e. Star Trek, the alternate Enterprise bridge)?

Nevertheless there are a few sight gags in the sets. For example, look closely at O's office. I don't want to give the joke away, but most of the time, we see it in parts, an edge here, an interior shot there, bits and pieces of it. However, when J leaves it to start on his rescue of K, the camera backs off enough that we see the entire office and its shape. That shape will look very familiar. Hint: This is a movie about aliens in more ways than one!

The MIB HQ in the past (1969) is a great homage to architect Frank Lloyd Wright. To get that, you have to look at images of the interior layout of the Johnson Wax building that Wright designed.

That's an interesting view, but there is a huge joke in the HQ as well. To get it, you have to have seen MIB I and remember where the cockroach's escape spaceship comes from. In a very quick pan of the MIB HQ of 1969, you'll see it again as the camera makes a pan across the room.

Conclusion:

MIB III is an unexpected delight. It has everything I want in a lighthearted and entertaining sci-fi movie. The acting is brilliant, the writing and sets... well, let's just say I thought the whole thing was brilliant. Entertaining, engrossing, kept me guessing, and it has just the right touch of heart to make it a ""I'm really glad I saw it."" movie.

And a note about Amazon.

I watched this on Amazon Instant Video as a 24 hour rental based on a Christmas gift certificate I received.

Once again, Amazon comes through with an easy purchase. I simply found the movie, applied my gift certificate code, and was even able to download MIB III temporarily to my PC (so it would play more smoothly.)

I was even able to watch some of it as it was downloading (on my computer this caused a bit of jerkiness, which is to be expected, my computer is an older model). Picture quality was excellent and it played very well once fully downloaded.

So hats off toe Amazon for their process in being able to ""rent a movie"".

And hats off to MIB III for being a great $3.99 rental.

Money well spent. I loved it!",1357257600,,9133,4.333137829912023

Men in Black 3 was another story altogether, number one it actually had a good story, and some imaginative plot twists.  There were a few moments that, were they not handled as well as they were, would have fallen completely flat, but they were handled really well.
All in all, great special effects that were not overdone, good plot, imaginative story, solid editing, good pacing that I found nether to slow nor too fast, good acting from good actors, all adds up to a damn good movie that was damn well made. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is cuz I am prejudiced against Hollywood, if you want to see a really excellent (non-Hollywood) sci-fi movie, I recommend ""Iron Sky"", but if you don't pay attention to the news, and don't know what polysyllabic means, you'd be happier with MIB 3.",1357171200,,964,4.704142011834319

Firstly, we have a disgusting few minutes at the opening with a young woman in an extremely sexy outfit is in a ridiculous scene (c'mon, is he really going to get visitors, considering who he turns out to be?).  Totally out of place and inappropriate for the targeted audience (heck, if they wanted to put a half naked woman in it, they could at least have put some thought into it and had it make sense).  Then the ending has way too much feeling in it to match the tone of the rest of the movie.  It felt like it belonged to a separate movie and was just tacked on.

4743712,4,B005LAIHQS,"Few movies work as hard to ruin franchise goodwill as MIB III does in its first thirty minutes.  Your boredom quickly turns to hostility once you realize that no matter how unimpressed you are with the tepid dialogue, forced jokes, and glacial pacing, Tommy Lee Jones is even more unimpressed than you.  By a wide margin.  It's as if the man could scarcely stay awake to deliver his lines.  Will Smith, on the other hand, vamps for audience with as much enthusiasm as he can muster, although he seems to realize that he's becoming an old dog with tricks of a similar vintage.  When he and Jones share a scene together in a car early on, you feel as if you are watching two old boxers, both on the take, just waiting for a few more rounds to pass so they can call it a day.

And then...

The movie jumps back to 1969, trades Jones for the living miracle that is Josh Brolin, and for the next hour and a half becomes the best summer action movie you have ever seen.  The pretense for having Agent J (Smith) go back in time is to prevent an alien named Boris the Animal from killing Agent K (Jones) later in 1969--something J realizes Boris has accomplished one night when K and all evidence of his existence after 1969 go missing.  Why J can remember K post-1969 when no one else can is never satisfactorily explained, but you will stop caring once J meets 29-year old K, played by 42-year old Josh Brolin.  That Brolin could not and does not pass for a 29-year old is almost immediately irrelevant, because Josh Brolin plays Tommy Lee Jones better than Tommy Lee Jones ever has.  After you have seen Brolin's spot-on impersonation and realized that it not only matches but in many ways exceeds the original model, you will wish that other Tommy Lee Jones movies would be re-filmed with Brolin standing in.  He's just that good, and his performance elevates Smith, who finds in Brolin all the chemistry he used to have with Jones.

The plot adds a few degrees of complexity to the ""save K"" framework.  First, J isn't allowed to tell K that Boris kills him because of the time-space continuum or some such nonsense.  Second, K's untimely death in 1969 kept the ""Arc Net"" from being deployed.  What is the Arc Net?  A plot device mostly, but also a giant shield that serves to protect the earth from an invasion by the evil race of aliens to which Boris the Animal belongs.  So, if K dies in 1969, then earth ends in 2012.

Smith and Brolin go traipsing through 1969, and obligatory (and obvious) references to the free-love era abound.  As with most jokes predictable, these fall flat, and they take up too much time (an extended scene with an MIB agent posing as Andy Warhol is about as clever as it sounds).  So what works?  Brolin.  No matter what he is doing, it is hilarious.  And Smith, as long as he is in 1969 (the race-based interactions are particularly funny).  And, oddly enough, technology jokes (it's 1969, so all the gadgets are...bigger).  And the action sequences, especially the clever climactic battle at the Cape Canaveral launch pad which is smarter than it is loud--a rare thing in the big-budget crowd.

But the script and director Barry Sonnenfeld truly shine with the tender elements, and not just the whopper at the end (which you will not see coming).  The smallest things--interactions between the younger K and a female agent he is sweet on, a moving vision of a baseball game that has yet to take place--are presented with none of the rush or camp that you normally find in summer tent poles.  The resulting undercurrent is somber enough to leave room for one of the most heartbreaking finales you will ever see in any movie, regardless of genre.  Agent K's steely demeanor has always belied a tragic past, a frustration at having to do the wrong thing for the right reason for far too long.  The big reveal does not disappoint, and you can feel every inch of Agent K's despair as he is presented with an awful choice, and then something worse.  The scene is piercing, and it will linger in your memory more than any other in the series.

It is impossible to overstate the difference between the first quarter of this film and the rest.  Had there been some tighter editing at the outset, this would be a five star movie.

4743718,5,B005LAIHQS,"All in all I found the movie very humorous and a great ending to the story line. The adventures of K and J are back in a whole new light, which makes this movie great from start to finish.
Boris, a creepy alien, tries to take down K as vengeance for the past. This main idea spawns the story around J needing to help fix the past as well as save a friend.
In all honesty, this really helps explain a little about both of K and J's backgrounds. However, if you watch the movie all the way through you get to see a connection between K and J, which is always interesting to me.
All in all, it's a great movie, very fun to watch. It's a little suspenseful. It adds a lot of great elements and funny ideas.
I highly recommend this to people. Especially those who have seen MIB parts 1 and 2.
Alright, I hope those that watch it enjoy

4743719,3,B005LAIHQS,"The series has run a bit out of steam, and here they don't even have a particularly bad-ass villain, but nonetheless this is an entertaining entry in the franchise thanks to Will Smith and especially Josh Brolin - who channels a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' character Agent K so perfectly, it's uncanny. The story is about a bad - VERY bad - alien, Boris the Animal, who escapes his maximum security prison and immediately finds a way to go back in time to kill the man who both captured him and cost him his arm - Agent K. Agent J (Smith) has to follow him back in time, and once there convince a disbelieving (yet, somehow, oddly more humane), younger K (Brolin) that he's in danger so the two of them can battle Boris together. Everything pretty much sticks to the formula, but what gets this 3-1/2 stars from me is the secret revealed at the end - the reason behind why Agent K becomes the emotionless drone he becomes later in life.

I might even give him the nod over Karl Urban's great read as Leonard McCoy in the Star Trek reboot!  (Is this a trend in hollywood?)  The movie starts boringly.  I don't mean slow, as there is a lot of action but it didn't generate a lot of excitement or anticipation.  The dialogue was poorly written for the most part.  Tommy Lee unfortunately comes across as just grumpy, and even though the movie provides an explanation in the end it could have been handled much better.  The middle of the movie with Will Smith and Josh Brolin was worth the effort of the first few minutes though!  The new interplay and peer interaction was very well done.  I'd like to see some way to bring Josh back in a next version ...  K could have an accident which de-ages him, which would be the Aliens' worst nightmare and the fans' (and series') dream come true for a ""reboot"" of sorts!

4744018,1,B005LAIHQS,"I remember going to see the original film when released July 1997.  I was first in the door.  Theater in my home where it open closed years ago.

I really enjoyed the first film.  Original, funny with good action/adventure.

Then we get to the second film.  I was disappointed .  Director Barry Sonnenfeld  basically just used Will doing this part he can do in his sleep-the smart mouth.  Tommy wasted in the role since it took long enough to bring K back into the film.

Now, we get to this film.

What a major disappointment.  After film 2 I was NOT looking forward to this & after seeing it.  Just a BIG disappointment..  The chemistry between Tommy & Will in the first film was gone.  Could you tell they had been partners for 14 years?  NO.

The story line.  Hey, have we movie goers NOT seen before characters going back to 1969?  NOT ORIGINAL  A salute to Austin Powers I guess.

Emma Thompson was wasted here-saw here in only part of the film replacing Rip Torn.  They could have done so much more with the character.

I will not spoil end of film here.  BUT, I guessed the end a mile before we got to it.  Then, it hit a wall & did not give follow up to the story line with K & O.

The main villain-a loud mouth & killer darts from another alien?  Please, that was the best they could do?

Then, we go to 1969 & show old technology BUT then bring out those cycles?  Excuse me, they also stole from Return of the Jedi?

A bad job all the way around.  2012 the year Tommy had-this was a hit BUT the least successful of the films, Hope Springs & then Lincoln.

Oh, one of thing the film makers/company did.  We know DVD's & blu rays are normally released on Tuesdays right?  Then, every once in a while a more successful film they do not release until Friday so not to lose money for release week discounts.  So, WHY WAS THIS FILM RELEASED TO DVD & BLU RAY ON A FRIDAY?  The LEAST SUCCESSFUL OF THE 3 FILMS, FORGOTTEN A WEEK AFTER IT'S RELEASE.  That was why I bought it used.",1356825600,3,1982,4.189333333333333

4744109,4,B005LAIHQS,"Having not been a big fan of the original ""Men in Black"" or its terrible 2002 sequel, this belated third entry in the series comes as a pleasant surprise.

Here, Will Smith's Agent J finds his world being altered, wiping out the entire existence of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) along with it. As it turns out, an extraterrestrial menace has broken free from a prison on the moon, gone back in time and terminated K's life back in the `60s. In order to save the galaxy and his partner, J heads back in time and meets with a younger K (Josh Brolin, brilliantly mimicking Jones' mannerisms and delivery) in order to stop the vile Boris the Terrible (Jemaine Clement).

The first two ""Men in Black"" films got by due to the chemistry between the stars, although I found both pictures to be hollow, one-joke pictures that relied too heavily on special effects. Despite a great deal of trouble behind the scenes with this third installment (production had to be shut down for several weeks while the script was reworked), ""Men in Black 3"" relies more strongly on its characters and what turns out to be a poignant story line as opposed to a neverending succession of wacky aliens and make-up FX. The film does have - as cliched as it sounds - a lot more heart than its predecessors, with Smith seeming more engaged, Brolin giving a lively performance, and Michael Stuhlbarg chipping in a particularly noteworthy role as a benign, Mork-like alien who spends his life perpetually analyzing possible future outcomes.

Director Barry Sonnenfeld helms the material without as much of a frenetic hand this time around - something that might disappoint viewers expecting a larger and louder sequel, but a decision that makes for a more satisfying and developed dramatic experience than its predecessors.

Sony's Blu-Ray offerings include a good looking 2D presentation of the film (1080p AVC encoded transfer, DTS MA audio) as well as a fairly effective 3D rendering with decent depth-of-field effects. Extras include an Ultraviolet copy, DVD, and fairly light supplements taking viewers behind the scenes with roughly an hour of content on the 2D BD and a couple of brief extras exclusive to the 3D BD (including a very short look at the conversion process).",1356825600,,2242,4.845953002610966

The acting is great, young 'K' is beyond expectations and the whole movie circles back to an outstanding ending...truly!!!

I was ready to turn it off at the restaurant. only the fish kept things going. about 30 minutes in one is either inured to how weak the writing is or it gets good enough to watch till the end. in some respects it is typical III of a series. the only thing keeping it going up to the weak end was the almost snappy patter of K and J. why O was even there is a mystery. Unlike I which is rewatchable at intervals or II which is significantly less rewatchable than I. I doubt I'll revisit III  a IInd time.,1356739200,,531,3.9626168224299065

4744798,4,B005LAIHQS,"I missed this one in the theatres. The second one was rather underwhelming, and it's been so long that I wondered what the point was. And while Will Smith doesn't drive me nuts like some actors do (coughTomCruisecoughSethRogencough), I don't go out of my way to see every film he's in. Still, Tommy Lee Jones is always fun in anything he does, so...

I was surprised that the film exceeded my expectations. A cranky alien escapes prison on the Moon, heads to Earth, and goes back in time to kill Agent K and make it possible for his race to invade the planet in the current day. Agent J follows him back, meeting the younger version of his partner, played by Josh Brolin.

Jones' role in this film is more or less an extended cameo, while Smith is somewhat a fish out of water in the earlier time frame. The film starts off a bit slow, a story by numbers perhaps, which quickly changes once Agent J goes back in time. The story picks up pace, and Brolin as the young Agent K is uncanny in the role, playing the character as grumpy as Jones, but still giving new nuances to the character. Brolin was a mostly obscure actor for years, but in recent years is rightfully getting attention as his potential as an actor is being put to good use. The story ties into the moon launch mission, which provides for some unexpected laughs, and the CGI mostly works well.

And oddly enough, a supporting character, an alien who can see potential outcomes of most any situation, provides some of the most poignant and funny moments of the film.

If you were disappointed in the second film, give this one a try.",1356566400,,1597,4.440273037542662

4745048,2,B005LAIHQS,"I chose to rent before buying; and am I ever glad that I did. I loved MIB; not MIBII, and for me the only saving grace for the third installment was Josh Brolin. No one else could have portrayed a young Tommy Lee Jones with what appeared to be such ease.

The story line could have been stronger; and I have to ask why did they cast Emma Thompson?

As others have stated, Will Smith certainly could have used more sass; and it seemed to me that even the aliens were old and tired, I can't imagine that these men needed the salaries they were paid; so why did they not insist upon a better production.

I may watch it again, as they offer 48 hour rental, but as it stands now I'd have to say, watch the trailer; it containes the best scenes and most laughs.",1356480000,,756,4.129251700680272
4745049,2,B005LAIHQS,"I loved the first two MIB's,  but this one didn't hold a candle to those.  It was slow and boring",1356480000,,97,3.8
4745050,5,B005LAIHQS,"I will be honest here.  I liked MiB II, despite the general consensus being that it's terrible.  I mean, I didn't think it was as good, fun or interesting as the first one, but I don't think it's deserving of the hate it keeps getting.

That being said, I didn't have much hopes for this movie.  I kept reading about production problems, script rewritings, filming delays and such, and it did look like MiB (the first movie) was going to be the highlight of the series.

After watching the movie in theaters, I'm pleased to announce that is not the case.  I'm prepared to call this movie the highlight (although marginally).  Despite all the problems it had, it's just that good.

Yes, the film has a couple of problems and noticeable plot holes, and you get to notice that different scenes of the movie were written by different people.  Why 5 stars, then?  Because it's a really, really entertaining film.

The special effects are great, there's no doubt about it.  While the side aliens are not as interesting as other ones in the previous films, the main ones are some of the best, both in concept and portrayal.  Main guys Smith and Jones are as good as ever, if not better.  The 60's setting is very well done (as you might know, this movie involves time travel).  One of the film's highlights, of course, is Brolin's portrayal as 69's Agent K.  His job as portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones is, at minimum, superb.

The script is more interesting too, despite suffering from so many writes and rewrites.  The story is quite engaging, and the movie is character-driven, and surprisingly emotional.  A part of the film will most likely leave you in tears, even in your second or third viewing.

All in all, the good far surpasses the bad, so this is a film which deserves to be watched several times.

As for the Blu Ray, the quality of the film is top notch.  I haven't watched the extras yet, but I might update the review when I do.",1356480000,3,1942,4.504297994269341

4745132,4,B005LAIHQS,The lesson learned by J was touching.  You need to listen to the conversations at the beginning to catch the full meaning of what he learns. Made for a fun evening.,1356480000,,164,4.290322580645161
4745133,5,B005LAIHQS,I was kinda let down by Men in Black 2.  It was a good movie but could have been better.  Men in Black 3 was much better.  I wish Rip Torn (Zed) was not in jail when they made this movie.  I think he would have been a little better than Emma Thompson as Agent O.  3D was pretty good but not great.,1356480000,,297,3.6507936507936507
4745134,5,B005LAIHQS,Loved this best because it had the best story line. May not have had the effects and surprizes like the other two but had a more appealing ending.,1356480000,,146,4.25

4745277,2,B005LAIHQS,This may not be fair if you like this kind of movie or the previous MIB movings.  Simply too silly for me.  Will Smith one liners were saving grace.,1356480000,,148,4.068965517241379

4745279,3,B005LAIHQS,"Had this sequel to Men In Black 1 & 2 been made about a decade ago I might have found myself more invested.  Even with decent acting, a solid script and an overall entertaining feeling, I just couldn't bring myself to care.  The time travel stuff was interesting, but frankly I didn't care that much.  I hadn't seen the first two movies since they first came out and am not that interested in it.  Will Smith is too old to be playing this character anymore and Josh Brolin was the ONLY reason to watch for me.",1356393600,,509,4.270833333333333

4745281,2,B005LAIHQS,"I really liked MIB I and MIB II. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith was great, the humor was witty and intelligent, and the plots moved at just the right pace. I've watched both movies several times and still enjoy them.

Unfortunately, MIB III didn't measure up to either of its prequels. It seemed that this movie was made only to cash in on the franchise, not because there was a fun or interesting story to tell. For one, Tommy Lee Jones looked terrible in this movie. He had no energy, and mumbled through his lines like he couldn't wait to get this movie over with. MIB II was made about 10 years prior, and you could really tell that time had passed. The fun back and forth between Smith and Jones that I expected simply wasn't there, and it seemed like the magic was gone.

The plot was also a real disappointment. It seemed to have obvious holes and plot devices that felt like they were there just to fill up two hours with content. After about an hour I quit watching this one. I suggest you stick to the first two movies and forget this one was ever made.",1356393600,,1085,4.313725490196078

4745337,2,B005LAIHQS,"Our family loves this movie and was so glad to see it again. We rented the movie in HD but the picture quality was more like analog. The picture was choppy and pixelated. We watched it twice and the picture was worse the second time viewed.

We still love the movie.....",1356393600,,270,4.294117647058823

4745344,3,B005LAIHQS,"This movie had funny parts and was action packed, but it was lacking in a lot of areas. It seems like Will Smith travels back in time only so that Tommy Lee Jones doesn't have to be in the movie very long. The villain is flat and uninteresting. The plot also follows a very linear path with few twists or turns - for the most part, you know where the movie is going and where it will end.",1356307200,,388,3.9871794871794872

4745443,5,B005LAIHQS,"While the first five minutes start off comicbookishly, it really picked up after that. The four of us who watched it really loved it. Probably more than the first two. A great balance between action and humor with a nice touch at the end, leaving you with psychological nuances to ponder.

MIB3 is a good sequel because it carries on the unique and enjoyable interaction between K and J, a few throwbacks to the previous chapters, and adds some fun new twists.  I did, however, miss Frank, the talking Pug...

One of the new twists was Josh Brolin who plays a very credible younger Agent K in the time travel sequence, which contains an unexpected surprise... Overall a very enjoyable fun flick.",1356220800,,484,4.670588235294118

4745669,4,B005LAIHQS,"*** This review is not about the movie itself but about the method for downloading from Amazon.  The movie was great which is why I gave 4 stars! ***

Does anyone else have a problem buying/downloading HD movies from a computer-to-TiVo versus buying/downloading directly from TiVo?

I have purchased/downloaded numerous SD movies and HD TV shows - and have always been able to ""DOWNLOAD to -DEVICES"" from the available menu option.  However the last two times I bought HD movies, I did not get that menu option - I simply got the WATCH NOW option.  The canned response from Amazon Customer Service was, basically, do it from your TiVo or ""open the Your Video Library on your TiVo"" and download the video from there.  There is no such setting on the TiVo Premier.  But Customer Service was able to push the purchased HD movie to my TiVo for me - so it must be technically possible.

Unless I'm missing something, my original complaint stands:  Amazon needs to add some OBVIOUS verbiage BEFORE a customer orders an HD movie that indicates they will NOT be able to download the movie from their computer.  Had I not contacted Customer Service, I would have been stiffed $3.99 and not been able to enjoy the movie.  Perhaps Amazon should add the ability to download HD movies like any other SD or HD show content to TiVo, or have TiVo add a direct link to ""Your VIdeo Library"" from the TiVo box.  Either would work to simplify this process.

But has anyone else experienced this?  And am I missing some setting in TiVo or Amazon that would solve this?",1356220800,,1547,4.598540145985401

4746000,4,B005LAIHQS,"I was really surprised with the 3D in this movie. There is alot of depth with some pop outs. The depth really adds alot top this movie, sure to the fact that there are alot of outdoor scenes in this movie. Most of the pop outs had to do with guns and hands, but still it was balanced really well.

As far as the movie goes I really enjoyed it, especially Josh Brolin, he did a great job playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones, even the voice was spot on. This one might not be as good as the first M.I.B. but it is better than the second, and the ending was really well done. Overall this is a must see movie in 2D or 3D, but if you can watch it in 3D definitely go for it!",1355961600,,668,3.8405797101449277

I recommend.

I know it's from 1957 but I love seeing how people were distinctly separated into classes with their prejudices and how one crazy woman tries to raise a boy to not fall into those trappings and to not be a snob.

This isn't Academy Award material and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But for those of us that enjoy this kind of movie I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it's no longer as new and innovative as the original. However, it still retains the humor, effects and story line.

So I decided to blow an Amazon provided credit to watch this. My wife was also not too keen on seeing this after the second movie.

We were both amazed and surprised by how good this movie is, I have to stop right here I like this movie so much If I keep writing I am going to ruin it for someone. If you liked the first movie and the second left you thinking yeah riding off the first one then the Third movie this one redeems the whole series but only if you see the first two.

I will be buying this when the price drops someday.",1355875200,,701,3.7945205479452055

Story development is a bit rushed and surrounding characters not as rich.  For my money, Vincent D'Onofrio's bug will never be surpassed, but Josh Brolin does a great Tommy Lee Jones.  Will Smith has developed into a superb actor, but has lost some of his youthful energy.  Still a great family movie with lots of exciting special effects.",1355875200,,484,4.726190476190476

In the past the creature characters had a good vibe to them, there was some good and bad, funny and not so but all and all rounded toward the overall feel of the story.  This one was overall just a bit darker in feel and the creatures rounded toward that.  Too much drama.

I have seen all the previous ones (and have the DVDs) but will probably not buy this one. If you loved the first two you will like this one, if not it will not improve your feelings about them.",1355875200,,595,4.05982905982906

There's nothing new, other than a great portrayal of a younger version of K.  Admittedly, the final 15 minutes are good, but it isn't enough to make the movie a good investment of your time.

4746816,5,B005LAIHQS,"I'm already a big Men in Black fan. It's based on a comic book, Jones and Smith (or should that be Smith and Jones?) are excellent and excellent together, and the first two movies were just so much fun. Say what you want about the second; it was still a lot of fun, and I like it. So do my kids. Well, MiB3 did not disappoint.

Smith and Jones were just as excellent as they always are, but it was Josh Brolin that really stole the show. He was amazing! He was as much Agent K as Tommy Lee Jones was. I mean, my kids thought it was some kind CGI magic and didn't realize that it was some other actor playing the character until we told them. That's some amazing stuff right there, and the movie is worth seeing just for his performance. Facial expressions, voice, everything.

It was nice to see Emma Thompson in the movie, also, although I was disappointed by the lack of Rip Torn as Zed. Of course, there was also Will Arnett in a small but hilarious role. He's great in those kind of walk on parts. And there was Bill Hader who is also just SO funny, and just the fact that he was playing Andy Warhol was a laugh all by itself.

On top of the great acting, the story was well done. The time travel stuff was handled well, and that's always an issue with any movie with time travel. And there was an emotional aspect to this one that was really lacking in the other two, and that was fabulous. It actually, literally, brought tears to my eyes, and, when a movie can bring tears to my eyes, well, that's saying something for the movie.

If you haven't seen Men in Black 3, you should definitely take the time to do it. It's a movie I'll be purchasing at some point, because I already want to see it again.",1355788800,4,1706,4.17629179331307

It had some good humor sprinkled through out the action, and this one had more of a human touch to it.

4747113,5,B005LAIHQS,I bought this movie because I like the first two and was somewhat disappointed by this one. I think they could have put more sass for Will Smith it just made it seem like he was tired of the movie before it got good. It answered alot of questions about  the way the charater K is the way he is. I love any movie that has Tommy Lee Jones in it!!,1355356800,,344,3.8450704225352115
4747114,1,B005LAIHQS,This movie was a huge let-down. The jokes are bad and the story is hard to follow and seemed like little thought was put into creating a compelling story. I was really looking forward to this movie because I thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments. This one had real potential because of it taking place in 1969. There were real possibilities of humor that was missed due to a lack of imagination on the part of the writers.,1355356800,,430,4.5256410256410255

I also like how the moon landing is portrayed as a purely human achievement, especially with all the conspiracy theories out there. The last 2 movies dealt with cases from K's past.

Yes it was more of the same as the first two productions.  It is not easy trying to top the original movie let along making something coherent and excel with new one-liners.

Yes why not time travel, revenge, and evil. Who would ever expect something hidden in a cake being brought into the jail?

I will not go into detail as that is the fun of the movie as secrets review themselves. I was really surprised to see anyone pull off a young agent K; Josh Brolin pulled it off quite well.

4747482,4,B005LAIHQS,"It has been a few years but the Men in Black are back for their 3rd movie. Will Smith (Agent J)and Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) reunite at the sparring duo trying to keep order in the world with our secret resident aliens.
I haven't seen the previous MEN IN BLACK films for years but I thought MIB III lack the energy and sparkle of the first two. Tommy Lee Jones seemed tired and maybe that is why they went back in time to have Josh Brolin play a young Agent K. Of course, there was humor in having a middle-aged Josh Brolin say he was 29. Those Men in Black agents don't seem to age well.

It is fun to have step back in time to 1969 with all the funky hair and costumes. Hey, who knew Andy Warhol had actually been an agent back then? Funny touch. The film seems to drag on a bit and there just isn't the enthusiasm as in the previous films. Back in 1969 we see that Agent K had a passionate desire for Agent O (Emma Thompson as adult O and Alice Eve and 1969 O) Brolin does a great job of capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the older Agent K but the young and older Agent O have no resemblance to each other except for a British accent.

Jermaine Clement is delightful and unnerving as the evil Boris the Animal who sets the travel back into time in motion. Boris ""Don't Call me Animal"" is pure evil and he may be the one to destroy Agent K and alter the course of history.

There is a very special element to MIB III that finally comes to light near the end of the movie. It's worth seeing this poignant and sweet tribute to Agents K and O as a bit of their history is revealed.

I have to go back and watch the original MIB. It seems the best to me but maybe because it was the original and so fresh at the time.",1355270400,,1729,4.017441860465116

4747484,4,B005LAIHQS,"The third Men In Black film rates third as far as freshness and innovation go.  The first was undoubtedly the best and the second was a solid excuse to go back for seconds, even if some of the calories were empty.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are adequate although they don't bring the same level of energy to this third installment that they bought to the first film, with a slight drop-off in the second film.  But, what makes up for familiarity and the lack of any revelation in number three is Josh Brolin's hilarious portrayal of a young Tommy Lee Jones aka Agent K.  He really nails it.  The special effects are up to the standards of the prior MiB films, although there's nothing new under the sun where the aliens are concerned.  Good excuse for some popcorn and light diversion.",1355270400,,790,4.489510489510489

4747590,3,B005LAIHQS,"Boris the Animal, a vengeful alien with a grudge against Agent K, escapes the prison on the moon, and goes back in time to kill young Agent K. To set the course of time back into the original, Agent J also time-travels back to 1969, to prevent the criminal alien from murdering K. It's a pretty typical storyline, but still acceptable.

In ""Men in Black 3"" you don't see Tommy Lee Jones (second-billed) very much. Josh Brolin plays the younger (and more emotional) version of Agent K, and his portrayal of the character is spot-on. Jemaine Clement as Boris effectively manages to balance between a deadly enemy and silly villain. But sorry, no talking pug this time.

The story of ""Men in Black 3"" takes mostly in 1969, which means jokes often rely on cultural references from the time. Some of them work, like the one about Andy Warhol and his famous soup can, but most of them are not particularly great. What is worse is the thin story that is not very interesting, except the final 20 minutes, where we are finally reminded that the film was about time-travelling.

It took five years for them to make a sequel to ""Men in Black."" Then it took ten years to make another sequel. Will Smith looks old, and so does Tommy Lee Jones. It's inevitable, as the first one was made about 15 years ago. I know the magic of the original is gone forever. ""Men in Black 3"" is amusing, but I still don't know why this has to be made after 15 years.",1355184000,,1436,4.411320754716981

4747712,4,B005LAIHQS,"This one tops my list of Men in Black films all of which are praiseworthy for the tongue-in-cheek, sci-fi comedy, neo-classic spoof genre. Which MIB largely created. We expect a certain continuity of MIB elements, but this one has a whole lot of unexpected nuances.  I'm a sucker for any plot that delivers time travel in a novel way and MIB III does not disappoint!

""K"" (Tommy Lee Jones)is taken back in time to a former self portrayed in an outstandingly believable parody of Tommy Lee Jones' younger self by actor James Brolin.  This chaotic uncertainty is all, of course, in order to preserve the right outcomes and perfect the not-so-right outcomes. Besides saving the world, ""K"" must defeat a formidable alien opponent but is assisted by an equally formidable and somewhat kooky, soothsayer alien.

And what would Men in Black be without the ever-cool and comic ""J"" (Will Smith) who also has to jump back in time without knowing how anything will turn out! His presence is absolutely required both in plot and in cast. This one is truly worthy of the MIB name. Fun and thrills throughout.....I was thoroughly entertained.

It did have some new characters in it, but it didn't really expand on the new characters like it could have.  That, in my opinion is the primary weakness of this third movie.  If it had developed more fully some of the scenes with the new characters in it, it would have been much more interesting and enjoyable.  As it was,  eeh-- not so much!  I probably would have wanted to have the movie and watch it no matter what anyone said about it because I am such a Tommy Lee Jones fan!!  However, that said,  now I have a movie I probably won't watch again, as opposed to the older ones which I have seen numerous times and laugh every time.

4748533,4,B005LAIHQS,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Almost a decade after the last film, Men In Black 3 hit the big screen in May of this year. It was a movie I was excited about, but one that I missed when it was in theaters. Well I watched it last night and I must say this is definitely deserving of the MIB title.

Because there was such a huge gap between films I was a little worried at how this entry would turn out, and as the movie started some of those worries came to life. The worst thing about M.I.B. 3 is that it starts off slow and in the middle it can get a little slow. That and the main villain Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) isn't really anything to brag about. I found his character to be pretty boring and, for me, Clement overacted the part. He tried too hard to make him feel intimidating but in the end it was just annoying.

What this movie does well is have an amazing story, interesting characters, and some great acting, aside from Clement. At times the story can feel like it's going all over the place, but once you reach the end the writers did a phenomenal job at tying everything together. Which leaves us with probably the deepest story we've seen from this series. Also, it gives us a little insight on just how far K and J go back.

I want to give major props to Josh Brolin who played Young Agent K. This man... just wow! He did a fantastic job at replicating Tommy Lee Jones' facial expressions, tone of voice, everything. I wasn't expecting to love his performance because from the trailers I wasn't sure how I was going to like the idea of a Young K, but they chose the perfect man for the job. Which leads me to my next comment. This isn't really a complaint as much as it is an observation, but Tommy Lee Jones looks terrible. The man is not aging well and it shows. It made me kind of sad when I was watching this because I love TLJ, but I'll get off that before this becomes depressing.

Finally, Will Smith's performance was fatastic. He may make some iffy decisions regarding roles in other films, but he never fails to come through with this series. He's funny, he's interesting, he has a lot of energy, and he hasn't lost his step as J. That was one of the most important things, for me, regarding this film. I wanted Smith to still feel like J. One question though: Will, where's your song on the soundtrack? I was really looking forward to another M.I.B. song from Will, but sadly there was none.

Overall Score: 8/10 - In short, this film is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of this series then I would definitely recommend watching this. If you're a fan of sci-fi films then I would recommend watching this. Lastly, if you're looking for an entertaining movie then, you guessed it, watch this. It may get a little slow at times, and the main villain can be a little boring, but in the end it's still an enjoyable experience.

Last minute edit: I wanted to give credit to Michael Stuhlbarg who played Griffin in this, but I forgot. I'll just say that Michael did a fantastic job and Griffin's character was amazing. He probably wound up becoming my new favorite character in this series even though there's a good possibility we won't see him in any future films.",1355011200,,3216,4.341098169717138

4748598,4,B005LAIHQS,"MIB 3 is totally silly.  But that's the point of course, and that's what makes this film charming, something that was lacking in the second in the series.

I have been a fan of Will Smith's for quite a while, and I believe that he's in his element in very serious roles - I actually liked ""Seven Pounds"" more than most - but he's even more in his element when he's just goofing off.  And goofing off is what he does here, while still keeping some semblance of sanity.  Tommy Lee Jones is always really good of course, but dare I say it?  He's getting a little too old I think to play some of these parts.  But the good thing is:  Mr. Jones knows it himself and seems to even embrace it.  Hey, we're all getting older, after all, and he's just doing it with more class than most of us.

And this is part of the reason, I believe, for some of the plot devices in this film.  I don't believe that I'm giving anything away when I say that Josh Brolin plays a younger version of Mr. Jones, and Mr. Brolin plays that part pitch perfect.  I thought that he was very good in ""W"" but he was really, really good in ""No Country for Old Men.""  Well, he keeps up that tradition here with his mimicry of Mr. Jones.  I got quite a few laughs out of his performance, and I believe that you will as well.

When it comes to thematic concerns - which aren't the reason for this film's existence, of course - it seems like the writer and director are trying to argue that it is quite possible that an infinite number of universes do exist.  Also, under some circumstances, it may be possible to ""fudge"" the current universe and coerce the outcome that you want, as long as you're willing to make some sacrifices.  It is nice when a movie does seem to have a good theme, as it helps hold the movie together for the audience.

Yes, MIB is completely silly.  But I wouldn't have it any other way.",1355011200,,1873,4.184357541899441

4748805,3,B005LAIHQS,"I'll keep this short and sweet for those who are about to push the ""Buy"" button.

I was REALLY excited to watch this movie after I heard that it ""might be better than #1"" and ""redeemed MIB2"". One of those two statements is correct.

Pros:
It's a great family movie.
Ties the MIB trilogy together wonderfully
Adds a nice amount of depth to the characters that was lacking in the previous two movies.
Made me feel good when it was over.

Cons:
The aliens are uninventive and really take a backseat to the rest of the movie.
Not impressed by ""villain""
The CGI is 7/10
A new vehicle is introduced, for about 3 minutes of the movie
Severely lacks the comedy of MIB1.

Summary: Fans who adore the first movie will be disappointed if they too have heard claims of it being the best of the MIB series. It's a great addition to the series but it honestly could have been more.

Final Verdict: You'll watch it once, but that one time view is worth it for MIB fans.",1355011200,,954,4.307262569832402

I was surprised at how good this movie actually ended up being.  It had a lot of the charm of the first movie and was able to tie up the Men in Black trilogy nicely.

4749071,4,B005LAIHQS,"This was an entertaining and funny movie and my wife and I enjoyed seeing it.  It was not as fresh as the first or second one but I love the characters and the premise of the movie that we are living among aliens of many races.  This one is interesting as a particularly evil and mean alien escapes from a prison on the moon and his goal is to get back at Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) for imprisoning him and cutting off his arm.

Agent J (Will Smith) has to go back into time to save K or the whole earth may be lost.  The movie is entertaining and Josh Brolin does an excellent job of portraying the young Agent K in the past.  He and Will Smith made the movie.  Of course the special effects and the aliens were just out of this world and it was fun to watch the interaction between Will Smith and the two actors who played the younger and older Agent K.  There were lots of funny one liners and a lot of action to keep you interested.

My wife and I rated this movie a 4 star ranking.  It is well worth seeing and you will enjoy it.  It is not a five star movie as it just doesn't seem as fresh and original as the first Men In Black movie.  It is the third sequel after all and some of the items are getting repetitive.  We both enjoyed Josh Brolin playing the younger agent K and perhaps if another sequel comes out he can become a full time replacement for Tommy Lee Jones who is starting to show his age.

Rent it or download it because it is worth seeing once and you will have a few good laughs. If you are a Men In Black fan then buy it as you will enjoy it over and over. .  I recommend it to you.",1354924800,,1606,3.931888544891641

The effects are capped off by a shuttle launch sequence that that was equal to, and possibly surpassed ""Apollo 13.""

4749516,3,B005LAIHQS,"Spoiler Alert!  Don't read this unless you've seen the other two movies!

I've liked the other MIB movies, and I like this one.  I think it will grow on me.  But if you remember the first one, Agent K is pining for the girl he left behind.  ""It's better to have loved and lost..."" Agent J. tells him.  ""Try it!!!"" K snaps back.  At the end of that movie, he's left MIB, is reunited with his long lost, and is shown with a beaming smile on his face.

In MIB2, Agent K is back to being taciturn because his wife left him.  But he shows more emotion when he's reminded of another long, lost love.  Remember the goodbye scene as she goes back to Zartha?  (Yes, I warned of spoilers, but I won't go into detail.)

In MIB3, Agent K isn't just taciturn, he's downright morose.  Agent J wonders why he's ""always"" been that way.  Say what?  Beaming smile never happened?  The warmth of that goodbye never happened either?

And for anyone who watched the first MIB, remember how much fun it was when Agent K put in the Eight Track and we got to hear Elvis singing ""Promised Land""?  Now it seems all Agent K ever wanted to listen to was ""cowboy music.""  And, you guessed it, he has a totally different long lost love, right there at MIB.

I don't know how many times Agent K has to be cured of his taciturn nature, but I'm hoping if there's a MIB4, they find something else to do.

Other problems: Not enough aliens, too many plotholes, never use a cute alien to slap the shiznet out of another alien (we just feel sorry for the cute alien), no Jeebs, no Frank (I know a lot of people found him annoying, but I liked him in small doses), not enough worm guys, and if you've seen the trailers, you've basically seen all the cool parts of the movie.

I found this film to be the best of the franchise yet and the biggest revelation is young Brolin who channels Tommy Lee Jones to tee.
The story finds the last remaining member of a race killing species,the Boglidytes,who is imprisoned on the moon,escaping from his cell and looking for revenge. He has only one good arm because his original captor,Jones,took it off apprehending him back in 1969 during the launch of Apollo 11. He plans to return to 1969 and kill the younger Jones. As Jones sits in his apartment armed and waiting for the Boglidyte to attack him,he suddenly vanishes.
The next day Smith shows up for work to find things have changed drastically. Jones,he learns,is not there,and in fact apparently died in 1969. Smith obtains a time travel device from an alien and travels back to 1969 in order to save his partner. He ends up at 1969 Coney Island and is just about to get his man when he is arrested by Brolin(the younger Jones).Smith obfuscates,telling all sorts of lies as to who he is and why he's there. Smith is put into a giant neural neutralizer and just as he is to get his mind totally erased,Smith finally fesses up. They must both travel to Cape Canaveral in less than six hours and defeat both the older and younger versions of the Bodlidyte. Smith takes on and defeats the present day Boglidydte while Brolin takes on and defeats the 1969 version. Just before lift off Brolin attaches a device called the Arcnet onto the conning tower of the rocket,which will activate a huge shield over the Earth,protecting it from future invasions. Smith,before returning to his proper time,learns a huge secret about his own life and how it relates to Jones.
This film just moves constantly,never getting bogged down in too much extraneous side plots. Brolin is nothing short of fantastic as he nailed his part as a younger Tommy Lee Jones. And the end revelation of Smith's real background really takes you by surprise when you first see it,which brings Smith and Tommy Lee's characters into clearer perspective.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There is commentary,a featurette and a gag reel.
In conclusion,a wild ride of a film that brings back the original duet of Smith and Jones and adds an even better third element in Brolin. I think it is the best of the franchise so far and look forward to a return of these three characters sometimes in the future. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1354665600,,2628,4.702819956616052
4749613,4,B005LAIHQS,"Well done; Josh Brolin was an excellent younger Tommy Lee Jones.  Well-paced and entertaining, I actually liked it better than MIB2; really liked how it looped back.",1354665600,,165,5.111111111111111
4749614,3,B005LAIHQS,"Well, it's most of the MIB clan back together (Rip Torn must have lots of money - or wanted too much of it) for this 3rd installment of the now 15 yr-oldish franchise.

The first movie was goofy as hell, but had a lot of charm - most of which came from snappy dialogue and the chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and the then relatively new to the big screen Will Smith.  Fast forward 15 years and the chemistry is still sorta there, although any sort of freshness from the writing or basic story has long gone stale.  The first quarter of this newest movie isn't very good - bad jokes, a disinterested Jones (Tommy Lee just there for the check it seems), and a lost looking Smith don't make for cinematic gold.

Things do pick up a bit when Josh Brolin (as a younger Tommy Lee) finally arrives on the scene as Smith travels back in time.  These two have more of the chemistry you remember Smith and Jones having in the original.  Brolin's just great as Jones - at times, it's was hard to tell if it was Tommy Lee doing ADR, or just a great impersonation by Brolin (it's all Brolin).

Nothing very original about the script and almost every opportunity for some jokes about the racism of the '60's are just passed up.  The only set of jokes based on the fact that Smith is a black super cop from the future are the most obvious kind (he gets pulled over in a stolen car).  Too bad, because with Smith, there could have been some very good BLAZING SADDLES moments - none of which are allowed to happen.

As it is, it's kinda cute when they go back to the late 1960's (although the time period actually feels more 1950's), and we get to see Bill Hader as Andy Warhol.  There's a surprising amount of sentimentality near the end of this film - as though Barry Sonnenfeld knows this is the last ride on this particular spaceship - and it proves to be this film's saving grace in what is otherwise a very bland and corporate flick.

It's fun enough to check out for MIB fans.

BOTTOM LINE:  3 Brolin rules outta 5",1354665600,,2006,4.286472148541114

4749616,4,B005LAIHQS,"Nobody plays somebody else, living or dead, like Josh Brolin.  Playing a younger version of the same character in the same movie?  No problem.  If you liked the other Men In Black movies this one is a sure thing.  It's fun, kooky, and goes to great lengths to explain the premise of the first two movies.  See it if you like MIB.  See it if you have no prior knowledge of the series but want to be entertained by creepy aliens and straight shooting good guys...in black.",1354665600,,470,4.344827586206897

4749618,1,B005LAIHQS,no problem with my internet  but this movie kept dropping and reloading made it hard to watch second movie in two days that did this,1354665600,,132,4.28
4749619,3,B005LAIHQS,It's an ok movie. Not in the class of the previous movies. Seems like they got a little bored and just rushed it together.,1354665600,,122,4.125
4749620,5,B005LAIHQS,"the movie may not have as many comedy as in the first and second one but the story can be very touching, im not going to spoil it but the movie tied it back to the first men in black and a great way to end the movie.
the acting was superb, action scene was great and the comedy was great, story wise it was very good.
my only gripe about this movie is that it does not have many aliens in it compared to the first one. If you are a fan of men in black then you must see this, to me it is actually better than the second one but that just me.
overall i love everything about this movie, its touching, its funny, and some good action. Villain not so great but every aspect of it makes it good.",1354665600,,691,3.839160839160839

4749744,5,B005LAIHQS,By far the best story of the three. Tied up all loose ends but one.. Left us with one loose end which I suspect will be tied up in the next installment.,1354665600,,152,3.78125
4749745,5,B005LAIHQS,This is solid performer in the genre of SCi-Fi movies. Very interesting from beginning to the end with unexpected turns. I strongly advise it to Sci-Fi fans.,1354665600,,157,4.851851851851852

4749747,4,B005LAIHQS,The second one was prety bad but this one is almost as good as the first. The characters were excellent but the jokes were not qhite as funny aas the first. Maybe it waas because it is no longer such a unique idea. I would still recommend it aas a weekend rental.,1354665600,,263,4.076923076923077

Much like ""John Carter of Mars"", I find it a little surprising that this movie did not do better in the theaters. I think it is better than MiB 2, and Josh Brolin does a great Tommy lee Jones. Also, Emma Thompson is a great choice as the new ""Zed"". I can only assume that ""professional"" movie critics are paid stooges and that I am the only person you can trust to review a film, because MiB3 was a lot of fun!",1354665600,,498,4.040404040404041

4749751,5,B005LAIHQS,Loved the storyline and found the movie to be just too funny! Think it's the best one so far however you needed the first two for the history to get all the humor. Have been telling people to watch it.,1354665600,,201,4.05
4749882,5,B005LAIHQS,"This is by far the best MIB to date. It was funny and sad and well made. Usually the first of two or three is the best and the rest not even worth seeing; but, not with MIB-3. We will be watching it again because it was that good! Enjoy...",1354665600,,239,3.8

4750053,1,B005LAIHQS,"What can you say about the movie, but that it is awesome. Loved it more than the previous ones and would give it 4 stars.

My one star is for this DVD set as I found out that the UltraViolet Digital Copy can not be downloaded to iTunes. UltraViolet can only be played streaming. My primary use for the digital download is for loading the family iPads for road trips or flights when we don't have a wi-fi connection. Sony and some of the other studios used to offer real digital downloads but now want to make their 'digital copy' proprietary which is alienating iTunes users. The Blu-Ray disc for me is of secondary value as we may watch it once and then put it on the shelf. I did email Sony customer service and they politely confirmed that they will not provide a real download of this movie for iTunes unless I purchase it separately at full price.

So, I'm returning this set of DVDs and downloading the movie from iTunes. That way I can play it through the AppleTV or load it on the iPad.

So CAVEAT EMPTOR and read the fine print before you buy a DVD with a 'digital copy'.

4750061,4,B005LAIHQS,Some of the effects in this movie seem like rehashes of the first two however it did have flashes of entertaining moments. This movie did have an insightful ending. The ending does have a sense of closure about it. Hopefully the producers leave it at that and do not turn this into a Rambo or Rocky type of scenario. Three of these is enough.,1354579200,,342,4.359375
4750202,5,B005LAIHQS,"Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: Men in Black 3 is not nuanced, high-brow cinema. It's plagued by some of the same things as most big-budget popcorn flicks -- occasionally overdone special effects, the stray plot hole here or there, and a bit of predictability. But as long as you can put that aside, and frankly such things should be expected anyway, you'll find an extremely enjoyable and satisfyingly nostalgic movie.

The Men in Black series seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it affair, and chances are if you enjoyed either the classic first movie or the.. well.. less than classic second movie, you'll enjoy MiB3 as well. Will Smith returns to top comedy form as Agent J, Tommy Lee Jones is as enjoyably grumpy as ever in his role as Agent K, and Josh Brolin delivers a nearly-perfect performance as a younger K. Whether Will Smith is paired up with the world-weary Jones or the brash, charming Brolin, the on-screen dynamic is always enjoyable and often hilarious.

The occasionally wonky plot is buoyed by an interesting -- if slightly predictable -- story arc and strong acting on all parts. Overall the movie much more resembles the first movie than the second, and for those who grew up watching the original there's plenty of nostalgia to go around. By the time the resolution comes around, it makes for a very satisfying and surprisingly touching finish. Don't expect a Best Picture winner, but MiB3 has enough working for it to offer nearly everyone a highly enjoyable experience.",1354579200,,1506,4.8108108108108105

WOW!

Not so..I thought the story original, the acting great, specially Josh Brolin, who played a younger Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).  Not a slow minute in the movie..kept my attention all the way through, and that is unusual..I am one of those people who fall asleep during movies!  Loved the surprise at the end of the movie!

If you have 3D capabilities, I have to say, the 3D effects in this movie, are even better than in The Avengers, which I thought were superb.

I will watch it again in regular Blu-Ray and see how the movie stacks up, visually, to the 3D version.

If you collect movies on DVD, and are a MIB fan, GET IT, you won't be disappointed in adding this to your collection.

Will Smith looked more bored than the plot to be there.  His performance rivaled some of the recently arisen on the Walking Dead.  Someone thought, ""sure, let's get the band back together one more time"".  While the audience thought, ""sure, how bad can it be?""  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Barry Sonnenfeld has stepped up to that challenge.  MIB3 makes SyFy originals look good.  I mean, have you Sharktopus?",1354406400,2,740,4.666666666666667
4750761,4,B005LAIHQS,"It's been about ten years now since the last MIB, and I can't say I was sitting at home thinking - I must have another one.. and yet, here it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If anything, the gap since the last one and subsequent lowering of expectations has helped this one by de-linking it somewhat from the first two.  And that's probably a good thing, since while still a hoot to watch, this certainly has some unfavorable differences from its predecessors.  Primarily, Tommy Lee Jones is missed.  Even in his 5 minutes or so of screen time as K, he doesn't seem exactly `present'.  This is compensated by having Josh Brolin do the best Tommy Lee Jones impression imaginable.. so perhaps I should take a quick moment to explain..
This is a time travel story.  Present day, K is dropping hints about great secrets left to be discovered.  K however is wiped out of existence, by an old nemesis escaping from prison, going back in time, and making sure most of K's career never happened.  It's up to J to go back to the 60's and put things right, to save his partner, and almost incidentally, the planet.  So Brolin is the younger K, and really does an outstanding job.  The other missing element however, is the edge - the first two had some genuinely black humor which somehow seems softened round the edges in this one.  Is the director Barry Sonnenfeld getting mellower with age?  I'd like to think so, rather than the alternative, that the writers just got lazier.
Those are minor quibbles, only happening because the first two (or at least the first) are much beloved.. but this really does work more than some of the critics would have you believe.  If the time traveling element starts to get a little wrapped up in itself near the end, its ok, because at 106 minutes the pace is fast enough you don't really pause to notice or think about it.  And the heart is provided this time by the new character Griffin, who is certainly likeable in his role as a being who is aware of multiple timelines.  The 60's continues to be a gold mine of humour for cinema.. interacting with characters both real and fictional from the 60's adds a new element that could probably have been mined for more laughs, but gets it just right by not over-egging the pudding.  The `bad guy' Boris the Animal (""It's just Boris!"") fills a required role without being either as menacing or as involving as his predecessors, but does the job.
All told - a welcome addition to the MIB series, and even if TLJ is missed, the other elements make this still a solid worthwhile watch.",1354320000,,2559,4.518438177874186

It was like, ""aw...cool"", ""wow"", and so on (sorry for the hippie vernacular, but it works well here). Will Smith does appear a bit tired, but wouldn't J be a bit cynical after a few years in the company? Much, much better than I anticipated, I am actually excited that they cared enough to do this one right. This has some amazing homage's after J travels back in time, it may take a couple of viewings.

4750890,4,B005LAIHQS,"Back in 1997, filmmaker Barry Sonnefeld (""Get Shorty"", ""Wild Wild West"", ""Pushing Daisies"", ""The Addams Family"") would directed the sci-fi film ""Men in Black"".

Based on the comic book series by Lowell Cunningham, originally published by Marvel Comics, the film which was budgeted at $90 million, would become a great success earning over $589 million.

The sequel ""Men in Black II"", despite poor reviews from film critics, which was budgeted at $140 million, would go on to earn $441 million in the box office and become a commercial success.

And a decade later, Sonnefeld would return to direct the third film in the movie series and feature a screenplay written by Etan Cohen (""Tropic Thunder"", ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"").  And reprising their roles as Agent J (Will Smith, ""Independence Day"", ""I, robot"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones, ""No Country for Old Men"", ""The Fugitive"").

The film would receive fantastic reviews from film critics and budgeted at $215 million, ""Men in Black 3 would earn over $624 million in the box office.

And now ""Men in Black 3 is available on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and on DVD.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Men in Black 3 is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and in English, French, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English - Audio Descriptive Track.  For those wanting the best picture and audio quality, I highly recommend going for the Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3.  Also, it's important to note that there is also a Blu-ray 3D version of the film that will be available on release day.

As for the DVD, picture quality is good as expected on DVD.  Many outdoor scenes are vibrant and colorful, skin tones are natural, black levels are very good.  And for the most part, I was quite amazed of how things looked when it came to balancing the sci-fi visual effects and also the monster/alien beings.  As for audio, good use of surround channels and LFE, but I would imagine with the lossless track on Blu-ray would sound much more immersive.  Still, for a DVD release, ""Men in Black 3 looks and sounds great on DVD!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Men in Black 3 comes with the following special features:

  Partners in Time: The Making of MIB 3 - (26:24) Featuring interviews with the cast and crew about their experience working on ""Men in Black 3.
  Gag-Reel - (3:54) Bloopers from ""Men in Black 3.
  ""Back in Time"" Music Video  - (3:34)

Note: The Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3 has more special features than the DVD release.

EXTRAS:

""Men in Black 3 comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the film to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The best ""Men in Black"" film!

I have to admit that after ""Men in Black 2, which left me incredibly disappointed, I didn't know if I wanted to watch this film.  And even actor Will Smith had reservations of working with filmmaker Barry Sonnefeld again, but Sonnefeld was persistent that he had something special with the third film.

And while on paper, the whole time-travel storyline may seem too banal for audiences, the way it was handled and its big surprise at the end of the film, made me a believer and a fan of the ""Men in Black"" series once again.

""Men in Black 3 works, thanks to the ongoing chemistry of these unlikely partners, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) but despite how dry Agent K is and quiet around his curious partner, the two have made a great duo in taking on these high level alien cases.

But when it comes to his private and personal life, it's one thing that Agent K doesn't want to get into.  And being the curious partner, Agent J wants to know why his partner acts the way he does.  And it peaks his interest even more when he meets a younger Agent K (Josh Brolin).  The performance by Josh Brolin was fantastic!  His performance made you feel like he is Agent K, but much looser and is able to communicate much more.  And makes J wonder, what happened in 1969 that changed Agent K's life forever?

And while the film is pretty much a cat and mouse game of trying to prevent Agent K's death and trying to save the world, the visual effects were well-done, the balance of both sci-fi elements, the costume design and the vehicles found in order to make 1969 look believable and its storyline was effective and it helps to have veteran talent involved in the film and knowing how to deliver with their overall performance.

The film looks incredible and while I am reviewing the DVD edition, while the DVD looks very good and sounds very good, there is no doubt in my mind that a film like this would look even more incredible on Blu-ray and also sound much better via lossless.  Also, the Blu-ray release has more special features than this DVD release as well.  So, I really recommend going for the Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3 or the 3D version if you have the hardware capable of watching films in 3D.

Overall, ""Men in Black 3 was a surprise.  Not only was it an awesome film but it literally made me forget how bad the second film was.  ""Men in Black 3 featured great performances, great visual effects, costume design and more of everything.  But most importantly, it's the story that captivates you.  Especially with an ending that you never saw coming... I really enjoyed this film a lot!

""Men in Black 3 is the best film in the trilogy! Highly recommended!",1354233600,2,5493,4.605561277033986
4750891,5,B005LAIHQS,"I liked the first two MIB, the first being the clear winner, so we rented this blu-ray expecting more of the same light comedy and fun goofiness. Instead we got one of the most fun time travel movies I've seen alongside a visual feast and a surprisingly emotional finish. For me at least this is by far the most interesting of the three films, lifted into the next level most of all by Stuhlbarg's oddly perfect moments.

Smith and Jones are as usual vastly entertaining, and Clement is a great villain; one gets the feeling that Conchords was merely the start of what could turn out to be a truly classic career. Thompson is flawless as always but the real shock here was how Stuhlbarg took his role and added an amazing amount of depth to it, making the film even more strangely real. His smile and glittering eyes somehow make his scenes come alive in a way none of the other movies achieved.

The script is both funny and very sharp, matched by Rick Baker's best space critters to date and phenomenal set design by Bo Welch. This movie really looks and feels like a mega-blockbuster should but also never feels pointlessly over the top like most popcorn sequels do. One of the highlights is seeing tons of ideas lifted from the best old sci-fi flicks; I saw echoes of Star Wars, Buck Rogers, Doctor Who, Barbarella, Blade Runner and so many other classics, all reimagined and retooled. There are some of the coolest gadgets here, and when set against the tight 1969 sets and cars and threads it all comes alive.

All in all, this was the best big studio surprise I've had in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater. But it looks perfect on blu-ray, with a crisp transfer and incredible colors and black depth. There are also an hour plus of truly useful extras, in which you see that this really is all about Sonnenfeld's unique vision matched by Welch and Baker and Smith and the rest stepping up with their A-games. So this is what a big flick feels like when it all goes right!

All in all, MIB 3 is a movie I'll gladly watch a few more times just to catch all the aliens and gadgets and colors and concepts, and above all the intelligent sense of fun that makes this one of the best third installments Hollywood has ever delivered.

And watch out for Stuhlbarg; he sure nails his role, and if there's an Oscar for a tiny part that makes a film really click, he deserves it.",1354233600,,2392,4.402714932126697

The the spin-off references to esoteric information.. general corniness and unnatural quality of interactions between people.. you can go on about how I should lighten up and it's only a movie, but I enjoy movies w/ thought-provoking themes & substance with at least some metaphoric resemblance to real life.. this is in suit with more of the watered down, 'appeal-to-everyone,' cliche present in much of the media now.

What a laugh. I slay myself...now where is my money?

This movie was nothing but a pay check for the actors and steady work for the union employees of the studio.  There is a reason it went striaght to Amazon Instant Video.

Give it a rest Will...you ain't funny if the writers don't write something funny for you to say.  Throwing in race on such a pissant script is a substitute for talented writing.  It appears that if the minimun hourly wage writers don't have enough talent to write a proper script they always strive to get a laugh by having a young, high-speed black guy demonstrate his moral superiority by saying something cute to reflect how ignorant the White cops are.

Emma Thompson was her usual superb self. We need to see

4751131,3,B005LAIHQS,"When MEN IN BLACK first came out, Will Smith could do no wrong.  Fast forward a decade, and it's a slightly different picture.  MEN IN BLACK II proved that not even the genius combination of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones could save a film.  And of course there were Smith's more dramatic turns, which failed to wholly entertain (even if he had proved himself a good actor).

The question you should be asking by this point in the Will Smith timeline is this: is MIB3 entertaining?  You can throw aside ""good"" automatically; if you come into this film with too high expectations, you will simply be setting yourself up for disappointment.  But can this film still entertain?

Well, about as good as any film involving senseless time travel can.  Agent K disappears; for some reason, J is the only one who remembers him.  So J travels into the past, where he encounters a younger J (Josh Brolin), and the pair team up to stop a time-hopping assassin (Boris the Animal) who managed to escape from a prison on the moon.

So...well, there you have it.  Smith is still in good form; he seems a little tired (and Jones seems a LOT tired), but you can't really blame them by now.  As Boris, Jamaine Clement brings some delicious overacting.  The character is poorly scripted--his dialogue is painful--but Clement clearly relishes the role.  The real ace in the hole is Josh Brolin, as the younger K: Brolin gives a dead-on impersonation of Jones, and yet manages to add his own stamp on the film.

Director Barry Sonnefeld and writer Etan Cohen still know how to have a good, effects-laden time.  Is MIB3 as good as the first?  Of course not.  But it's probably better than the second, and certainly offers up a good romp for anyone who likes their action with a little humor and a dollop of zaniness.  That being said, let's hope the gang leaves well enough alone, and doesn't offer up a fourth entry in the series.",1354147200,7,1904,4.579881656804734

4751136,5,B005LAIHQS,"In the Hollywood of franchises, few are successful --critically speaking, that is --, especially those developed after superheroes or so-called graphic novels. One of the immensely successful ones, both critically and by the public, is ""Men in Black."" And, just when we thought that the second installment was the last one, that there was no way that a third one could be done, comes the delightful ""Men in Black 3,"" a hugely entertaining, intelligent sequel, as good as its predecessors.

The movie starts when a gorgeous woman goes to jail to deliver a birthday cake to Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), an extremely violent criminal, who happens to be jailed under maximum security, at a prison built on the moon.  Little did the guards know what was inside the cake: the key for Animal's escape. Once out, Boris returns to Earth for his revenge. He immediately goes to a store and buys a time-travel machine. He desperately wants to go back in time to kill the man who took his arm, this man being Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Boris succeeds, and in addition to trying to kill Agent K, the future of the planet is at risk. Agent K tells Agent J (Will Smith) that the biggest mistake he ever made was not killing Boris those days. Instead, by returning to the past, Boris was going to kill Agent K, changing this way the course of history. However, Agent J won't allow this, so he also travels to the past, to 1969, so that he can save his friend's life. Once there, he finds Agent K when he was only 26 yrs old, this time played by Josh Brolin. In addition, they will receive invaluable help from Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg).

As in the previous ""Men in Black,"" the new one is also leaded with funny, extraterrestrial entities, mostly in a Chinese restaurant. Particularly hilarious was the scene in 1969, when Agent J meets Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) - also an agent --, who at one time requests Agent K's help, by yelling, ""K, I can't tell women from men!"" The Blu-ray & DVD editions also include making-of documentary, gal reel, music video by Pitbull, alien games, and more. (USA, 2012, color, 106 min plus additional materials).

When I first heard about this third movie my first though was...why...doesn't seem like a new one is needed. After watching this I have to say that this may be my favorite in the series. While the others were OK this one seemed to have a real plot and felt more grown up then the others. There is still quite a bit of comedy and kids will still enjoy this but the overall feel was more adult based and I think that really helped me enjoy this one more.

4751402,5,B005LAIHQS,"WHY these people review something they have not seen is beyond me, but no use wasting time trying to figure it out.

I, however, HAVE seen the movie, finished it about 10 minutes ago. I saw it with my 15 year old daughter and my husband, all of us with different tastes in movies and all of us in love with this film. We all loved the first two, with differing favorites, but this one is quite unique.

I am not the kind that reviews a plot, you can find that on [...], I think a review should be the writer's opinion of what they saw, not a synopsis.

The first MIB was a new, unique type of film, with original characters and excellent chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones...who'da thunk it?

 It was a huge success for many reasons and therefore made a lot of money, so they made MIBII. This movie was good as well, more of the same, for those of us who didn't get enough of the first film.

So frankly, when MIBIII was announced I was a bit Leary, thinking ""how can they do this again without it being stale""? Well let me tell you they not only gave us the duo we love, but even better versions of them and of the franchise (Both young and old ""K"", young ""K"" being an almost miraculous performance by Josh Brolin). We have a plot that is worthy of the MIB series, but with a twist at the end that is breathtaking and highly emotional, something you would not expect from an MIB movie. This, to me, elevated the entire series a few notches. Another pleasant surprise was the humor, which is more prevalent, relevant, and intelligent. It felt like each actor was giving his/her best in this film, not that the others were bad, but there is very little ""camp"" in this film, yet the irreverence and humor are still there.

My family, of 3 conflicting tastes, sat staring at a 17 inch computer screen for an entire movie and were enthralled, and afterwards all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time.

Buy this movie, DVD, Blu-Ray, or amazon on demand, it doesn't matter but you need to own this film. It is fun, fast paced, funny and poignant. Wish I had more than 5 stars to give it.",1353196800,7,2113,4.251870324189526

It seems the new trend is to put all the bells and whistles on the BR and leaving crumbs or worse for the people who buy just the DVD version.  It was the same with 'The Avengers'.

4751516,2,B005LAIHQS,"I loved the zaniness of the original Men in Black. The sequel couldn't match the original, but at least had some funny moments. But I just don't get the decision to even make Men in Black 3. It's not as if the world was screaming for a sequel.

Indeed, MIB3 lacks the humor of its predecessors. It tries to be a character story about Agent J and Agent K's origins. However, neither character is particularly interesting or worthy of a movie outside the trademark MIB humor. Agent J is just Will Smith being Will Smith, while Agent K is dour and humorless.

MIB as a franchise just isn't about compelling characters - it's about alien gags. And MIB3 had surprisingly few aliens or alien humor, outside a bar fight in a Chinese restaurant and the main villain, Boris the Animal. Even the little cigar-shaped aliens only get a cameo.

MIB3 is worth watching for fans of MIB, but it's a somewhat pointless end to the trilogy.",1350259200,,921,4.536144578313253
4751517,3,B005LAIHQS,"Let's be honest, the first Men in Black was FANTASTIC! It was something new, unique, funny, and had some action. Positive reviews and a strong box office later, it was pretty obvious it would get a sequal. Unfortunately, everything that I loved about the first Men in Black was pretty much ruined in the second.

Moving on, 10 or so years later we get, surprisingly, a third entry in the series. As long as this one was better than the second, I would be fine. And fortunately, this was a BIG improvement!

So, MIB3 starts off with a MIB ""alien prison"" on the moon, and one of the prisoners, a crime lord named Borris the animal, escapes seeking revenge against agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who is the man that took Borris down. Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and K are dealing with normal ""MIB"" matters on earth, however, Borris breaks into another facility, and uses a special ""time travel"" device and goes back in time to 1969 and kills the young agent K (Josh Brolin). This erases our modern agent K from existance, and the world has completely changed. An alien invasion is now spreading across earth, and the world is pretty much facing an apocalypse. Agent J, however, is the only person who seems to remember the existance of old ""Tommy Lee"" agent K. So, Agent J then gets a hold of the ""time travel"" device and goes bak to 1969 as well, to stop Borris the animal from killing the young K (if anyone thinks that was confusing, don't worry, you should follow it pretty well while watching the movie, just don't think about it too hard.)

The POSITIVES:
-None of the scripts in these movies have been that spectacular, and this one is pretty much on par with the first two.

-The special effects and action never dissapoint! This one easily has the best action of the trilogy (and a VERY entertaining climax!).

-The sets and costumes are fantastic. The most interesting parts (for me) was the middle, where a large part of the film takes place in 1969, and the setup in this time period is really entertaining to watch.

-The acting is great, each player does their part well, especially our three leading men.

-Alot of people have complained about the ending plot twist, saying it is ""illogical"" or ""unnecessary"", but come on, it's MIB we are talking about here. It was still emotional, and well done. And you shouldn't bother scratching your head over this, considering how confusing the time travel aspect of the the plot is.

-A specific actor, to note, is Josh Brolin as Young agent K. He gives an AMAZING performance as K, and gives an oscar worthy impersination of a young Tommy Lee.

The NEGATIVES:
-When it comes to the time travel element, there are too many things that you are forced to question, and really should have been explained better. Specifically, after old agent K is wiped from existance, they never really tell you WHY agent J remembers agent K's existance while everyone else does not. They do briefly explain how, but they don't give you a full explanation, and it would have been nice if they took an extra 5 minutes to help explain this stuff to the audience. Another thing to add: If old K is wiped from existance, then how is agent J even an agent at all? In the original MIB, old K personally recruits J. There is a scene at the end of the movie where you might get an idea at how J still ends up becoming an agent, but it still isn't quite enough. Point is, the movie needed an extra 5 minutes of dialogue to help explain the time travel element, so you aren't left scratching your head.

-The comedy. Specifically, the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are too many skits that just don't work. Quite frankly, there are 1 or 2 scenes where I was questioning walking out of the theater or not. Sure, the scenes with Will Smith and Tommy Lee are great (they continue to work great together) but it's nothing we havn't seen before. After the first 20 minutes or so, the humor started to get funny, and although there are still a few later parts that fall flat, they don't last long and the movie moves on pretty quickly.

-The music isn't very good at all. The majority of the film was OK, but the theme at the beginning was TERRIBLE! What was even more dissapointing was the fact that I LOVED the music in the trailers, but I was NOT pleasently surprised when I found out none of the trailer music is actually used in the movie. And I was shocked when I found out Danny Elfman did the music. I love most of his work, but he seriously droped the ball with this movie.

-Agent J. If there is one good thing to say about MIB2, it's agent J's character. Sure, he was still that same kid, BUT, he had definately matured greatly. In MIB3, however, Will Smith is still trying to be that same goofy kid from the first movie. In this he is over 40, so it just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want him to be a mature strict K, but I just wanted to see his character developed more. However, we do get a great emotinal scene with J in the end, which worked really well for the character, so that was cool. And im NOT saying anything bad about Will Smith (who gives a great performance as always) I just didn't like how he was written in the first two thirds of the film.

Overall, MIB3 is a fun ride. Sure, it's not NEARLY as good as the original MIB (which was an instant classic), BUT, this is a GREAT improvement over MIB2, and overall, is still a good movie. If you liked the original MIB, you should have fun with this, just don't expect TOO much from it. But, if you didn't like the first MIB, you MIGHT have fun with this one, but I highly doubt this will when you over. Overall, a good, fun movie.",1350086400,2,5644,4.389473684210526
4751608,4,B005LAIHQS,"It's not a fantastic movie, but it isn't bad. It is entertaining but not a super awesome movie. It has it sad moments. 3rd part provides enough information about the characters which we didn't know of. As for younger agent K, the actor was good. So overall it is worth watching but you shouldn't expect too much of it.",1350086400,,318,4.406779661016949
4751609,3,B005LAIHQS,"I seen the previous two MIB movies so I thought I might as well watch the third. A lot of the time the third movie falls way short. This one was no blockbuster, but it did not fall short either. I thought the movie stayed true to the core of the rest of the MIB movies without getting to crazy or turning into a back to the future movie. It also did not go into some long winded discussion about not bumping into someone you know or the fabric of time will rip.

This movie is a good time waster so rentable, and if you are into the MIB series enough buyable, not for me though.",1348617600,,578,3.9827586206896552
4751610,5,B005LAIHQS,"While I'll admit I'm not a rabid MIB fan, the third installment is fun and has (a little) heart. The 1969 setting served the story well and the production design was faithful to the era. Josh Brolin makes a great ""K"" so it's disappointing that (save a spin off set in the early 70's) he will not get to reprise the role if there is a Men in Black 4.",1348185600,,349,4.0
4751611,2,B005LAIHQS,"After the disastrous MIB2, the third and hopefully final film in the franchise is more in the mold of the first but lacks the playful charm and wit and descends into weak one-liners and silliness. By throwing time travel into the film, the screenwriters could essentially stitch together a group of disparate scenes hastily scratched on the back of napkin and then excuse themselves by moving around the time line. Somebody send in a Terminator, please. Prediction: the next MIB will happen on another planet since that's the only really obvious thing they haven't done yet and Will Smith can crack some incredibly predictable jokes.

Okay, the plot focuses on a bad guy that K formerly imprisoned escaping from moon-based incarceration using a cake (yeah, really) and somehow getting back to earth. Figuring the simplest way for vengeance, he decides to go back in time despite the fact that he kills people in the current time incredibly easily. There's the Chrysler building, 1960s, blah blah blah, and what seems several hours later something to do with Neil Armstrong (RIP). There's a huge sentimental twist in the ending that might have made me cry but I used up all my tears from boredom.

Tommy Lee Jones genuinely looks too old for the role now and Josh Brolin is truly uncanny as the younger K, pulling off the perfect impersonation of Tommy Lee 3,4,5 or however many decades ago. That's undoubtedly the best performance of the film. Will Smith's wisecracking doesn't do much for me the third time around and Emma Thompson is frankly wasted. The franchise insists on casting pop-culture minor celebrities so we're offered up Jemaine Clement as the bad guy which is only marginally better than Johnny Knoxville from the second film.

The CG is pretty awful for most part with some badly lit green-screening and cartoonish animations that completely kill any of the potential tension in the scenes. Much of the production styling and music is copied directly from the first so there's not much new here. Even the aliens are mostly recycled which is a shame since their characterization was one of the strongest parts of the original. And that's really the story of the whole film - we've seen it before but whereas the first was clever, stylish, witty and engaging, this is repetitive, tired, badly written and tedious.",1347926400,6,2327,4.916030534351145
4751612,3,B005LAIHQS,"The pieces are there, and they're moving in the right ways, but this long-awaited revival just doesn't feel right. That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II.",1347235200,,1402,4.870292887029288
4751613,2,B005LAIHQS,"Worse case scenario and the saddest: The day Will Smith ran out of gas.

Didn't think it would happen. Frankly, didn't think it *could* happen. But it has.

Hopefully, this is a bump in the road. A flat tire and not complete engine failure, because the man is just too talented to be washed up. On the other hand, I see from IMDb that the majority of his next few projects are all sequels to films he's done in the past. That's generally a bad sign - squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out of a squashed and beaten shell. i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The story opens with a correct linear timeline: 14 years after MIB2, which in itself is rather telling. Anyway, a nasty alien creep has just escaped from the secret lunar prison. His goal - go back in time and prevent Agent K from deploying a global defense net around Earth. And in doing so, allowing his creepy race to ravage our planet in the future. Agent J's mission is to stop the alien, prevent Agent K's death and thereby saving the world. Yawntastic. Additionally, a touching sidestory and clich&eacute;d plot device, of J finally getting to meet his father; whom he always believed had abandoned him and his mother when he was still a young child.

This film reminds me of the recent disaster known as 'Dark Shadows', where another displaced character finds himself immersed in a world he couldn't imagine. And just like that crock pile, there were lost opportunities; not taking full advantage of the fish-out-of-water theme.

Boring, boring, boring. No gas, no go.

If you've ever seen the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B005M2A4D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;programs (any of the new Doctors) - that - that's what this franchise so desperately needed. In all seriousness, the producers should have hired the entire Dr. Who creative team, paid them whatever they wanted, and told them to go to work.

The only thing that made this movie endurable: Josh Brolin. His incredible spot-on impression of Tommy Lee Jones adding depth and energy into a character that I think has run its full and total course. Nothing left now to resurrect, in any form - ever.

Had hoped that, like the fantastic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-Ghost-Protocol/dp/B004EPYZUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol</a>&nbsp;and stunning rebooted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-2009/dp/B002PMPTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (2009)</a>, this sequel would be a sparkling new wellspring of ideas and energy, showcasing the franchise in a fresh light.

Didn't happen.

And just like dour Agent K - Director Barry Sonnenfield has definitely run his course; the past decade has shown that repeatedly and regrettably. If nothing else, Emma Thompson's cringe-worthy 'alien eulogy' ought to prove that beyond any shadow of a doubt.

My sincere hope is that Smith finds a new... something. He's done 'cop' to death, every variation, every scenario. Sure, he does the occasional run for an Oscar (which is looking more and more unlikely every year that passes) but the bread-n-butter material is desperately needed at this point. Some new vein of movie gold he can really dig into.",1347062400,5,3344,5.562992125984252

4751616,5,B005LAIHQS,"I did not have high hopes for Men in Black 3. The first film was a staple of my childhood, but its 2002 sequel was a major disappointment that's best forgotten. While my initial expectations were optimistic, I grew cynical when I heard that filming had commenced without a completed script. Ten years removed from the previous installment, it seemed like this film was a way of cashing in on an established brand...Like Will Smith really needs the money. Well, color me surprised. This third film in the franchise not only stands shoulder to shoulder with the first, but it boasts an entertaining and well-plotted script. Considering the troubled production, Men in Black 3 is some kind of miracle.

The film opens at LunarMax Prison, a high-security facility located on the moon. Housed there is Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), the last surviving member of an extinct alien race, who escapes with the intention of going back in time to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) before K is able to shoot off Boris' arm and capture him. After K learns of Boris' escape, all traces of him disappear and Boris launches a large-scale attack on Earth. With Agent J (Smith) being the only one with any recollection of K, he must time-jump back to 1969 to save him and all of humanity. J is warned to specifically avoid K and to come back to the present after he's killed the present-day Boris. Following a clue to Coney Island, J is apprehended by the young Agent K (Josh Brolin). Explaining the situation, K reluctantly believes him and the two find themselves working together to stop the present and past Boris from carrying out his plan.

Time travel is a tricky subject in any medium. There are a lot of kinks that must be worked out to create a cohesive and consistent narrative. Are there plot holes in Men in Black 3? Certainly. But it's not a movie that lends itself to in-depth analysis of its plot structure. The time travel stuff is handled remarkably well (excuses can be found for many of the discrepancies) and it's so clever and paced so well that any plot holes can be easily overlooked. Etan Cohen's script has creative ideas, a great sense of humor, well-developed (although kitschy) moments of drama, and a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. While the second film proved a good script is a necessity, the magic of this franchise and the secret to its charm and longevity are rooted in the confident direction of Barry Sonnenfeld, the chemistry between the principal actors, and the wonderfully creative designs of the aliens that populate the story.

Those in charge of designing the aliens for this movie have reached deep into their well of creativity here. Whether it's the main antagonist or the background characters; there's a lot to admire here. Even better, there's more subtlety than the previous installment and the aliens here are fascinating without having to try as hard as the second film's Balchinian.

While Jones doesn't have much screen time, he and Smith still have great chemistry. They're certainly an odd pairing, but it's hard not to smile during their charismatic and witty banter. Smith has his share of hilarious moments and reminds you why (even after a 3 year absence from acting) he's one of the biggest actors in the world. Josh Brolin has been earning rave reviews for his role as Young Agent K and this praise is more than deserved as does something totally unheard of. It would've been easy for the filmmakers to throw Tommy Lee Jones in some prosthetics or cast someone completely unlike him. Instead, they cast Brolin and he's extraordinary. He manages to not only look exactly how one would imagine a young Tommy Lee Jones, but he physically embodies him perfectly and he sounds exactly like him. This is one of the few times I can recall being convinced that I'm watching the younger version of a character and not just a different actor playing the younger version. Even more remarkable is that Brolin isn't just doing a really good Tommy Lee Jones impression; he actually brings depth out of the character in a way that wonderfully complements Jones' performance. Many have said you should see the movie just for Brolin's performance. I'm in the camp that will point to other reasons, but for a role that could've been a novelty act; he's truly impressive.

Sonnenfeld began as a cinematographer, transitioned into directing with The Addams Family in 1991 and has been a hit-or-miss filmmaker ever since. He deserves a wealth of praise for undertaking this massive project without a script or proper preparation and delivering a worthy sequel and an entertaining summer blockbuster. It was a gamble, which makes this accomplishment all the more remarkable.

I had so much fun watching Men in Black 3 that I can find very little to criticize. Boris, while much better than Lara Flynn Boyle's villain, can be annoying at times. He's a revolting, effective villain but here personal taste collides with objective criticism. It doesn't help that has some of the most ham-fisted dialogue in the film. Aside from this, Men in Black 3 is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's terrific entertainment and one of those rare moments where a sequel actually rivals the original film. More importantly, Men in Black 3 is a successful reparation for the abominable sequel ten years ago. I actually vote they remove the second film from the canon and re-title this film Men in Black 2. While it's been overshadowed a bit this summer season, Men in Black 3 is the most entertaining film I've seen this year and, if you're a fan of the series, you won't want to miss it.",1344729600,,5611,4.785345717234262
4751617,5,B005LAIHQS,"I loved the movie; however, the packaging with the ultraviolet digital copy is not what I will tolerate. I've been through that frustration so much with the new films. Personally, I look forward to downloading only the digital copy on I-Tunes.

The decision means I play it on my Apple TV setup. The film is in my library, where I have easy access and where I can add it to my I-pad or I-pod. And if in the next while something happens to erase the film from my library, I can download it again from I-Tunes from the home site, where you can put it back into your library without a charge.

I won't be buying the packaging. Why do that? I don't need another film to stick on a shelf.

But I will buy this film. It's why I gave it five stars. Although I liked all three equally well, the first and third are my favorites. I love the way the writers and producers and director tied things together.

I have not yet seen the 2nd one. However, I was still able to legitimately laugh at certain parts of this one. When I go to a movie, I don't usually expect to be blown away by how good or bad a movie is. I didn't really get blown away by this one, but at the same time, I was never anxious to know how much more time was left in the movie. There were a few slightly grotesque things shown, but that's to be expected in a movie like this, considering what happened in the first movie, and the fact that it's a sci-fi movie. The thing that surprised me the most was that there were a few touching scenes sprinkled into it--most notably toward the end of the movie.

Plenty of funny/gross alien moments (where you find yourself cringing and saying ""eww!"" and laughing at the same time) - the usual MIB routine, with maybe a little more ""eww"" to the aliens then in the previous movies.

Josh Brolin was an excellent casting choice to play the younger version of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).

BOTTOM LINE: I would not say it was better or worse than the other MIB movies, to me they are pretty similar. Not a ""must see"" movie - but certainly fun/enjoyable.",1341878400,,588,4.376146788990826
4751722,4,B005LAIHQS,"It has been fifteen years since ""Men in Black"" surprised audiences with its uniqueness and quirkiness. There were effects that you swore were from Tim Burton and a storyline that we had never seen before. The original is still a must watch kind of movie and probably will always be. Many critics have already said that ""Men in Black 3"" is better or equal to the original and some have said just the opposite. Personally, I find this one of my most difficult reviews because they are both right and both wrong.

K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) have been partners for a long time and still don't know much about each other. That seems to be the overriding theme to the movie as K's past comes back to haunt him in a big way. Boris the Animals (Jermaine Clement) has been imprisoned on the moon since an event that occurred on July 18th, 1969 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Anyone who knows American history knows what happened on that date and at that location. It's an event that K has never discussed with J and it's up to the audience to decipher why.

""Men in Black 3"" may have the scariest villain of the three movies. His alien traits may be too much for some youngsters. Although he is also, hands down, the most effective villain of the three movies. You feel his dangerousness and you understand why K does as well. Because Boris is such a dangerous and fearful villain, he also changes the mood of the film. That, to me, is the biggest thing to note about ""MIB3"". It is a different movie from the other two. ""MIB3"" has a more emotional feel to it. It is less chaotic and less happy-go-lucky. The humor is there, don't get me wrong, it is just less.  The movie may be less fun for some viewers, but that isn't to say that what is in its place is bad.

J is forced to go back in time at one point during the movie and when he does so, he finds K at the age of 29, this time played by, not Tommy Lee Jones, but Josh Brolin. This is probably one of the most amazing aspects of the film, and it involved no CG or computer f/x.  It involved Brolin doing an impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Apparently, the impersonation began during the filming of ""No Country for Old Men"" and was perfected before filming ""MIB3"". It is the greatest illusion of the film. Brolin nearly backed out of the movie because he didn't think it was good enough, but the final result is outstanding.

""MIB3"" is a good movie but the herky-jerky looseness of the first two films is lost and replaced with a more moody film. The emotional connection between the two agents is explored and it makes for, not worse, but a different film in the series. It has been a good summer for movies so far, possibly one of the best ever, and Spiderman, Batman, Snow White and Prometheus have yet to arrive.",1341446400,,2772,4.341698841698841
4751723,5,B005LAIHQS,"Men in Black is my one of my favorite movies of all time. It came out when I was about 5 and I have watched it maybe a million/ a million and a half times. Although I liked Men in Black II (as opposed to most critics, who despised it)it definitely fell short of the original. I am happy to say that, in my personal opinion, Men in Black III was totally awesome - totally deserving of the MIB title.

Why?

It made me laugh (a whole bunch- this movie was seriously the funniest movie I have seen this year) and it made me cry at the end.

TLJ and Will Smith have such great chemistry - it's unmatched by any other buddy comedy I think I've ever seen.

The one sad thing: Tommy Lee Jones is not in the movie very much. However, Josh Brolin does a picture perfect impression of a younger him- it's fantastic.

4751726,4,B005LAIHQS,"I grew up with Men in Black, the first one was pretty original and just a fun time overall before Will Smith got old and predictable, while the second one also helped me grow up with learning about bitter disappointment, so almost ten years later another Men in Black would be interesting, and while I think most people forgot about this series until the third one was announced, the time did it well to give the writers time to make another one. Well here it is, Men in Black 3, and I'd say it's as good as the first one but it doesn't have the advantage of being the first one so it doesn't feel as fresh and original as the first one, oh well.

In this one a convict that Agent K put away has gotten a hold of a time machine (more of a device actually) and goes back in time to kill K before he stops the guy, and J (Will Smith) goes back to the shagadelic 60's to stop him from killing K. When I first heard about this it seemed like a ploy so Tommy Lee Jones wouldn't have to get his old cranky ass onto the movie set every day, but he's still in the movie enough for it to work and game enough to do an action scene, go Tommy. So while the plot's a pretty cool new way to show MIB the back in time thing kind of reminded me of the 2nd one where they had to take stuff from the past for the plot, this one fully devotes to the past.

So what's good about MIB taking place in the past, well there's an abundance of alien jokes to make about the 60's and they hit a few good ones but not enough to make it a flat out comedy (like they did with the 2nd), the villain in the 60's had a Dustin Hoffman Easy Rider-era vibe to him, the racism card was played in perfect doses, and the Andy Warhol bit was a golden oppurtunity they hit perfectly. Other great moments were seeing the gadgets the MIB used in the 60's, especially the giant neurolizer tube got a chuckle out of me.

If there was a disappointing aspect about MIB 3 though I'd say it was the action, it felt kinda forced at times and I didn't really feel any tension or anything, even when they're like 100ft in the air the tension was just gone, and in the opening at the Asian restuarant it felt like they had to show J shoot a few bad aliens, maybe as a little reminder to the audience that yes, this is in fact a MIB film. But in true MIB style they kept the action light with jokes peppered in, so really it was no big thing chicken wing.

Josh Brolin was great as a young K, he brought a whole new aspect to the character, showing him a little (very little) less serious and enjoyed his job with a rat-pack vibe to him. He was entertaining enough to carry the movie but not enough to outshine Tommy Lee Jones.

Probably my favorite aspect about MIB 3 though was the new villain, he was x1000 times better than 'tentacle rape woman' or whatever from the second one, and just about as creepy as the cockroach in human skin in the first one. In the opening scene (before the Asian restuarant shoot out) he breaks out of prison, all the while delivering gloriously cheesy and over the top one-liners, and his name was Boris! He was straight out of the 60's batman show, they could've had him more in the movie but that might've taken away his charm.

Anyways what else is there really to say about MIB 3? It was a fun time at the movies, delivered the goods and the aliens were unique and interesting, the story was good and had a small emotional punch at the end, and it was a hell of a lot better than the 2nd one.  So in the decade of randomly revived movie series Men in Black 3 was refreshingly well done and back to the formula which made it work well in the first place.",1340582400,,3638,4.093969144460028

4751829,3,B005LAIHQS,"Will Smith's sun has dimmed in recent years, and it doesn't help that we haven't seen an M.I.B. film in a decade, so the buzz on the franchise has waned some. Still, I got mad love for the Men in Black and wasn't about to pass up on this third installment. And, it turns out, my faith is redeemed... but with a caveat or three. The franchise still has legs, but now you can spot them varicose veins.

It's not the worst thing in the world if the script isn't finished even though the film is already shooting. CASABLANCA, for one, famously managed to steer itself straight even though the writers were still scrambling days into the final shoot. But if you've just seen MEN IN BLACK 3 and you're nursing this sense of disconnect and discontent, then, yes, do blame the screwy script. For one thing, Tommy Lee Jones, who only had several weeks to shoot his scenes in the can, probably remained clueless as to how the plot ultimately unwinds. Place his lackluster performance - and the fact that he seemed so unengaged - on that doorstep. When all's said and done, Tommy Lee Jones' minimal appearance essentially amounts to a glorified guest spot.

Agent J (Smith) wakes up one morning to rewritten history and to an alarming new obsession with chocolate milk. He discovers that his partner K (Jones) had ceased to exist in the present day, that K, forty years ago, was fatally gunned down by Boris the Animal, a world conqueror who is the last of his malevolent race. To reset the timeline, J promptly time travels to 1969, and so we're treated to a terrific time jump sequence. And even though it's only peripherally relevant to what actually goes down in the the narrative, J is also trying to prevent a massive alien invasion. Although, by now, chances are that residents of the Big Apple merely roll their eyes at yet another hostile alien armada menacing their cityscape.

On July 15, 1969 - the day before the historic Apollo moon launch - J meets a decades more youthful K (Josh Brolin), and by ""meets"" I, of course, mean ""is arrested by."" K doubts J's M.I.B. credentials, but then credit J's convincing gift for gab. It prevents his exposure to 1969's humongous version of the neurolizer. Off they go then on a hunt for Boris the Animal, with J stealing fascinated glances at his new/old partner. At this stage, K is 29 years old, although he still exhibits that weathered look, still craggy-faced, still laconic and impassive. ""You got some city miles on you,"" remarks J. Like you, I'm mouthing the line along with Will Smith, because I saw the trailer.

General concensus suggests that MEN IN BLACK 3 does improve on the sequel but pales under comparison to the original. From there on, opinions vary. Some call MEN IN BLACK 3 a return to form. Some can't get past the flaws. Me, I lean towards favoring it more so than not, but there are issues.

It's a bit of a shock to learn it's been four years since Will Smith was in a feature film. It's gratifying that he can still channel the cool Fresh Prince persona. His past four pictures had restricted him to more somber roles. But Smith still has that old magic. He simply oozes charm. But he doesn't own this movie.

Josh Brolin owns this movie. His impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones' terse Texas drawl is freakin' uncanny. He captures Jones' delivery perfectly, and his demeanor. Brolin develops a more fun-loving side to K. Another character I enjoyed is Griffin the alien clairvoyant (Michael Stuhlbarg, bringing a puppy-like charm). Griffin has a knack for glimpsing multiple futures, and he has good moments in which he fusses and tries to determine which version of the future is currently  unfolding. Thankfully, the film doesn't overdo these bits.

The plot and premise are tantalizing enough that it's all the more of a gut punch when bits of the movie fail to come together. There were moments in which I was bored. Emma Thompson steps in as the new M.I.B. director, Agent O, with Alice Eve playing her younger counterpart in 1969. There's a romance that is early on implied between Agents O and K, except that both Thompson and Eve end up mostly sidelined, and so that plot thread really never does get picked at. And I miss Zed. Sucks that Rip Torn was having so much legal trouble, he had to be written out of the story.

The stuff I liked? I got a kick out of the ""Andy Warhol"" scene. And I thought they did a fantastic job of visualizing the 1969 setting. I liked that they didn't shy away from addressing the existing racism of that era. It's a bit of an irony that, in 1969, when those cops get their profiling on and pull J over, that J actually did just boost his ride. It's a really fun sequence. So, yeah, the scenes that they get right, they get amazingly right. Ultimately, though, the payoff isn't there. One ongoing beat has J time and again harping on what made K into such a closed off, hardened soul. This is answered in the climax, during a big reveal. But it's a reveal that comes out of left field and feels so forced. It sours the film that much more for me. And I still can't wrap my head around that stunt J pulls in Cape Canaveral while wrestling with the big bad.

I still recommend MEN IN BLACK 3, strained though it is. I'm still liking the M.I.B. universe, and how strange it is and the level of imagination that goes into constructing it. Will Smith creates a nice chemistry with Brolin, and it's nice to see Smith back to being the fun-having Will Smith, instead of the morose Academy Award Will Smith. We still get those scenes in which the most fun lies in checking out the cool background details, because Sonnenfeld and his creative team reward us with those outlandish little sight gags. Clunky futuristic jet packs, sweet gyrobikes, graffiti aliens, a slightly more lighthearted K... Even after fourteen years on the job and now a Class 1 Senior Agent, J still hasn't seen it all. And neither have we. I'm banking on a third sequel. Here come the MEN IN BLACK 4. Na na na na na-na-na...",1339891200,2,5992,4.5398148148148145

4751831,5,B005LAIHQS,"After the apocalypse of Independence Day and the epics of Star Wars and Star Trek, the sci-fi field was ripe for a spoof. Men in Black was the DEFINITIVE spoof of the sci-fi genre when it came out, an entertaining balance of light-hearted drama, action, and wacky comedy. The sequel...wasn't quite on the same level of film-making, lacking a smart script, and showing just what happens when Sonnenfeld gets carried away with drenching his stars in colored goo. And now act three rolls out and we have...

""I promised the secrets of the universe, nothing more.""

After the insanity of the previous two Men in Black movies, everything moves in a different direction this time around...fourth dimensionally. When I heard that this movie would be all about time travel, and when I heard that the script was generated in a huge rush so that they could get the movie out on time, I expected the worst. I was VERY pleasantly surprised this time around. The basic plot revolves around an evil alien who sets out for vengeance on K using time travel to erase him, so that he simultaneously kills his nemesis and sets in motion the destruction of Earth in the present. A simple premise, but the execution of said premise SHINES.

""Here, take this, and all you have to do is jump.""

From the get-go this movie has fun with all the old and new sci-fi tropes. J has to time jump by literally jumping off a building (Girl Who Leapt Through Time anyone?) in a great super-cartoony CGI sequence that I'm SURE would have been awesome to see in 3D. When he actually gets to 1969 there's everything from a GIANT neutralizer that doesn't quite look safe, to new gadgets that result in some awesome action sequences (unicycle speeders and rocket packs). And naturally all the typical 1960's stereotypes are toyed and joked with, but in most cases this is very well done, while at the same time giving us subtle clues into the nature of K and his relationships through a new perspective.

""I am getting too old for this. I can only imagine how YOU feel.""

It cannot be overstated how PERFECT Josh Brolin is as young K. He manages to be super-serious in that Jack Webb style while simultaneous displaying the same chemistry with Will Smith's agent K. He delivers his lines with perfect comic timing, and gives his character a lot of heart. Will Smith might be sleep-walking through the role, but he's got some GREAT lines this time around, and it's obvious he's having a great time with the role. The rest of the cast likewise does a great job with their roles, and keeps things light-hearted and fun (with only a few dead gags here and there).

This movie is big, bright, and beautiful. It was clearly designed to be viewed in IMAX 3D and it shows. Everything is just so vivid and well-framed, and crystal clear. It really makes a nice change from the very darkly lit and darkly framed films that have been popular the past few years. And as my wife commented to me right after the movie finished, most movies are SUPPOSED to be fun, light, and leave you feeling good when you exit the theater. They are supposed to ENTERTAIN you (at least that's the lesson I got from Sullivan's Travels, your mileage may vary). There's room for every kind of movie, but this kind does what movies were meant to do in the first place. MIBIII is FUN, and it has a lot of heart. The end of the movie really and truly surprised me. The climax of the time travel plot results in a plot revelation that was not only NOT stupid, but actually was heart-warming (giving you a HUGE character development twist on K that I never saw coming). That's just plain good film making. Not to mention awesome little surprises that are purely the result of good writing (an accidental time jump turning the tables on a one-sided fight) and excellent direction.

""You got some city miles on you.""

Some people might start watching this movie feeling like I did, that the franchise was really looking like it was running out of gas. I was thrilled to find that MIBIII is now my favorite film the series. It's a great comedy with wonderful comic timing, a great adventure with lots of great action sequences, and its got more character, charm, and heart than anything else in the series yet. I will definitely buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray and would recommend any fans of the series do the same.",1339372800,117,4417,4.565656565656566
4751832,5,B005LAIHQS,"MIB 1 did something rare - it created a wonderful atmosphere of stragithfaced implausibility, with huge chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. MIB 2 followed fairly predictably. It worked, but sequel-slump had set in. So, in deference to the memory of MIB 1, I saw this - but didn't get my hopes up too far.

As a result, the humor and especially the warmth of this one took me pleasantly by surprise. Given the time-travel theme, it's both a sequel to the others and a prequel. (Josh Broslin, by the way, does a flawless job as the 1960s K.) Saying more would say too much, so let's leave the plot description there - suffice it to say that it's a lot more touching that I had any reason to expect, and a lot more explanatory.

Additional characters worked well this time. Emma Thompson's ""Agent O"" character echoed Dame Dench's ""M"" from the recent Bond flicks, but that throat-scraping introduction set a whole different mood. And, speaking as life-long nerd, Griffin just charmed me. Maybe not one for the ages, this is still a great restart of the franchise, but also very watchable in itself. Despite the general trend of movie sequels, this really leaves me hoping for more.

4751833,5,B005LAIHQS,"Really enjoyed this entry in the MiB series. Although it didn't seem like there were as many aliens in this installment as in the previous two, an alien (who I honestly thought was voiced by Tim Curry) escapes from a moon-based prison, gets to Earth, goes into the past, and kills Agent K. Fortunately Agent J still remembers the time he'd spent with his partner and finds a way to go to the past to try to save him. Oh yeah, and the rest of the planet too.

There is some fun action in this movie, but it is mostly a character story that develops the relationship between J and K. Josh Brolin does a great take on the young Agent K. The interactions between Will Smith, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones made this a good time that flew by.

I can not say what or why.  Just trust me!  There was action and humor in the movie.  However, I didn't feel like there was as much as in the first two.  Same with the music.  I honestly can not remember even hearing music in the film.

The first two were cool.  Smiths character was just getting used to what was going on.  Figuring things out.  This movie though is like 15 years after the last.  Seems nothing has changed since the second.  I kind of feel like some stuff should have happened.  I almost felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s that had been made high def and 3D.  I think because I have not seen Jones or Smith in such a long time.  It's like they decided to make a movie, threw a dart at a board and got this.  It was funny.  I will buy it as soon as I can.  I just feel like it was missing something.  I actually think it was because I got there so late.  I felt rushed.  Not sure if that makes a difference.  I am leaning towards yes.

I will watch the blu ray and update.  Whenever they release it that is.  I am giving it 4 because the action was great and it had a fun story.  It is something I would and will watch again.

update:
I realized something about this movie.  Everything seemed to be in the same place.  There was not much moving around.  Nor was there any working up to the story.  In the first two, something would happen.  Then they would go and try to get information on the people or aliens that were causing the trouble.  In this movie, something happened and that was it.  There was no working up.  Everything seemed kind of dull.  It was fun but it just seemed to have been missing a lot of what made the first two so great.",1339200000,2,1833,4.056338028169014

4751837,2,B005LAIHQS,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:

I really enjoyed the original Men in Black movie, because it was fresh at the time. We got to discover the Men in Black organization along with the future Agent J.

Unfortunately, this sequel really doesn't have anything new to offer. The memory eraser is used over and over again. The aliens among us are still oddball bizarre looking creatures. The only part that was funny was the Andy Warhol character, which only older adults will understand as humorous.

Josh Brolin as the young Agent K was somewhat interesting, but if you've seen the first two, you may find this sequel boring.",1339027200,4,609,4.780952380952381
4751988,5,B005LAIHQS,"The original MEN IN BLACK was memorable because it was a quirky sci-fi movie that had just the right balance of comedy and action. MEN IN BLACK 2 followed in that same vein, but the film wasn't as strong and felt more like a retread. MEN IN BLACK 2 was released in 2002 and a decade later (due to script issues, scheduling conflicts, and budget problems), the boys are back in MEN IN BLACK 3 and while the film isn't as funny as the original, it's a far superior film to MEN IN BLACK 2.

The film begins on the lunar prison base, a maximum security facility that was specifically designed to hold Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement who seems to be channeling Tim Curry), the last member of a species of creatures that's sole purpose was destroying and devouring other civilizations. Boris has been in prison for forty years and what he really wants is to travel back through time and kill the man responsible for his imprisonment and the loss of his arm: Agent K. Through some stealth planning, Boris escapes.

Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) still work for the top-secret organization that protects the Earth from intergalactic threats. Events during the past few days convince K that Boris is out to kill him. While that's true, K is mistaken on just when Boris plans to commit his crime. After fighting Boris, K & J have an argument of sorts. The next morning, J awakens and discovers that all signs of K have been erased. He soon learns that K was killed forty years earlier. J has to travel back through time to 1969 and prevent the younger K (Josh Brolin) from being killed.

There will be some who will be disappointed by MEN IN BLACK 3 because though there are plenty of jokes and lots of humor, the film isn't as funny as the original film. However, what makes the movie a better film that MEN IN BLACK 2 is the characterization and a script full of pathos, not to mention plenty of action.

MEN IN BLACK 3 focuses on the relationship between K & J. The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.

Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K. Brolin is a great actor. I've been impressed with him time and time again since first seeing him in THE GOONIES. His resemblance to Tommy Lee Jones is uncanny. Also notable in the movie is the portrayal of Michael Stuhlbarg as the last of another alien species who is capable of existing in multiple dimensions of space and time at the same time.

MEN IN BLACK 3 isn't as funny or action-packed as MEN IN BLACK, but it is a far superior movie than MEN IN BLACK 2. It's highly entertaining and makes me glad to that the men in black are back.",1338854400,2,3172,4.4229452054794525

Add some minor eye candy and a little cheese and we have a hit movie. In this one there is the element of time travel which excited me as much as the aliens did in Indian Jones when I found out about it. However, it works out well.

There is no introduction of characters. The film assumes you know them and the MIB story. They pick up with the same running gags as the previous films, only now they have lost some humor. J is the only person not effected by the change in time, he is still part of MIB, and is the only person alive who remembers K who dies 40 years ago.

Josh Brolin plays the 1969 agent K magnificently. Interesting aspect of the past life of K. I loved the NY Mets of 1969. Good climax scene for the big screen although I would wait for the DVD (you're going to add it to your collection anyway).

Now, after a long gap, there's another sequel, which just seems unnecessary.  But Men in Black 3 is, surprisingly, a good movie.

For those who haven't heard anything about the story yet, here's the basics.  An old enemy of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) escapes lunar prison and goes back in time to kill K before he's arrested.  Agent J (Will Smith) must then go back in time to save his partner and help his partner save the world the same way he did in the original timeline.  This gives Men in Black 3 a chance to play with the dynamics of the central relationship.  Even as a junior agent, K is reluctant to leave J in control of the mission.

Part of its success is brilliant casting.  When you think of a younger Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin does not come to mind.  But his Agent K is uncanny.  He's got Jones's mannerisms down pat, but there's a levity and energy to his performance that reverses the passage of time.  Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) plays Griffin, a fifth-dimensional being.  He's constantly babbling about which future he's in and the paths people might take.  This could be annoying, but Stuhlbarg (in his terrible woolen cap) sells it.  He's dorkily endearing.  Jermaine Clement, of Flight of the Conchords, is terrific as Boris the Animal.  (""It's just Boris."")  He's unrecognizable except for his deep voice, which is perfect for Boris's menacing proclamations.

Emma Thompson and Alice Eve also join the cast as older and younger versions of Agent O.  Thompson does a fabulous job as always and Eve is fine in her few scenes.  But the film didn't quite earn K and O's semi-tragic never romantic relationship.  It's the problem of a series where each movie is produced without a plan for continuity.  K already had one wonderfully done failed relationship.  This one feels obligatory, like you can't have a summer blockbuster without a love interest.  O would have been fine as a fellow agent who just cared for K as a long-time colleague and friend.  (Or perhaps I'm just frustrated that at this point in the franchise all of the female good guys are love interests.)

There are a couple of standout scenes.  There's a funeral for Zed, played in the first two films by Rip Torn.  Obviously Torn couldn't be in this film because of his legal troubles.  K's eulogy, paraphrased, ""He never told me anything and after decades I know nothing about his personal life,"" is perhaps the greatest compliment one man in black can give another and also hilariously brusque.  There's Agent J being hassled by cops in the past.  There's also Bill Hader's terrific cameo as Andy Warhol, unfortunately spoiled by the trailer.

If you didn't like Men in Black, then I'd avoid Men in Black 3.  (Common sense, really.)  But if you did enjoy it, the new film might be a pleasant surprise.",1338336000,,3320,5.265267175572519

Quick Movie Review: MIB 3 continues the adventures of Will Smith as J, and a younger version of K played by Josh Brolin, who does an exceptional job capturing Lee's performance.

Along the way, J discovers answers to the list of questions he has amassed working as K's partner for 15 years.

My husband and I saw this movie over the Memorial Day weekend. Tommy Lee Jones has a relatively small part and my husband made an astute observation/comment ""I don't think there will be a fourth, Tommy Lee is really getting up there."" I've always enjoyed Jone's understated acting and thought Brolin did an okay job as a young K.  However, they tried to pass Brolin off as 29 years old, to which J responded ""those must've been city miles"" in order to make the timeline work with the first moon landing and other historic events.  Unfortunately, Brolin saw 29 years old a very long time ago. Also, Brolin just does not have the same gravitas and magnetism as Jones. Smith does a fine job, as usual. Z is gone and Emma Thompson (who has had enough work that she is almost able to be mistaken for Annette Bening) is O who now runs the agency.

4751997,2,B005LAIHQS,"The MIB concept of an official group dealing with extraterrestrials living secretly on earth is great.  I own MIB and MIB 2.

This movie concentrated on a single given ""alien"". And that ""alien"" looked essentially human.
Both K and J act like super-heroes, not normal people, in that they crawl over structures like Spiderman.

And time travel was the major thing in the movie. Not single time travel, but multiple time travels occurring simultaneously. Cornier than corny.

Aliens, the very few that are shown, are only secondary to time travel.

There was sooo much original background material available to work with to generate great new original stories. But no, they had one clich bad guy and spent the movie hunting him down. All clich. All done many times before in many other movies.

They could have had more emersion of the MIB group dealing with multiple aliens; e.g., something like Avatar and MIB-1 did: emersion in an alternate reality. But no. Just standard invincible super hero stuff like Thor and Batman.

Also there were no jokes to overcome the lack of a story. I never laughed once. What happened to the joke writers?
What a waste.

4752059,5,B005LAIHQS,"MOVIE REVIEW #34 : "" MIB:III (Men In Black III) ""

They definitely saved the BEST for last. MIB III is by the best of the three films in this franchise - why? Not because of the amazing special effects,  or the extreme use of incredible 3-D visuals thrown at you  - or - because of the incredible Rick Baker (Hellboy, X-Men: The Last Stand, Enchanted ) real creature make-up effects - it's because it mixed the best of storytelling and action/adventure with relatable characters and a sprinkle (or three) of good humor!

Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Wild Wild West, Get Shorty) and writers Lowell Cunningham (Men In Black I & II)  and Etan Cohen (Madagascar 2, King of the Hill) did a very good job of bringing a characterization of obviously a sci-fi world, to real life. In emotion, they allowed the characters to grow and be flawed - and they tell why, how and even when. They did this film right and for the right reasons.

The story involves the one thing that seems to mean blockbuster success at the box office - Time Travel (when they work - for example Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, The Terminator, Austin Powers: Man of Mystery!)  It's the concept of going back in time to prevent something that happened - from happening - changing the course of history. The time travel sequences are - if anything - original and stocked with amazing visual effects!

Imagine Will Smith ""J"" traveling back in time to save Tommy Lee ""K"" from a murderous villain who survived but was not supposed too - while not changing an historical event in 1969 - Florida. Got it? The film tells and explains it all....creatively and humorously. Now add another amazing performance of Josh Brolin (W., No Country For Old Men) as accurately recreating every nuance of Tommy Lee as a younger version of ""K"". Will and Josh are just as amazing together as Tommy and Will.

Will Smith (Hitch, Independence Day) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, Batman Forever) have an amazing chemistry together and the first two films work well in terms of their comedy styling's, but this one has a big heart and compassion and you are not left `wondering why' as so many films tends to do in this genre. Tommy's dead pan delivery and Will's `off the cuff' deliveries make for some very funny moments.

Some standout performances, if for their humor alone come from, Emma Thompson (Harry Potter, Nanny ""O"" McPhee) as the linguistically gifted Chief of MIB (it is sad to see Rip Torn not in this film) and Jermaine Clement (Rio, Despicable Me) as the ever creepy and extremely visual bad guy of the film. He is intense and extremely ruthless in his performance against Tommy Lee.

The effects and CG, combined with the enhanced 3-D style of photography, just add to the film. It's fun, adventurous, candy to the eye and several times may make you jump with a few surprises. (All funny and alien in nature!)

One other stand out performance comes from a character who can see as many as five alternate realities at a time - visually stunning and performed imaginatively by Michael Suhlbarg (Hugo, A Serious Man). His ethereal performance adds, explains and even enhances the story to where if this all could be true...this is how it would happen. He is also part of the reason this film has more of a heart than the first two.

Lastly I cannot forget to mention Danny Elfman's (Alice In Wonderland, Batman) as the returning composer of the score. If you are not tapping your feet (or humming the tune) to the thumps of the MIB signature theme as the action unfolds...time to get your ears checked!

This film had everything for me; it's fun, it's funny, it's got action, it's got special effects and - more importantly - it's got a great story with a good heart in the center of all of it.  I predict it will probably do well at the box office. Now you have The Avengers and MIB III to have some family fun this summer of 2012 - so far.",1338249600,3,3896,4.553648068669528
4752060,4,B005LAIHQS,"THE PLOT: J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) encounter troubles when a dangerous alien criminal, Boris (Jemaine Clement), escapes from his moon-based prison and goes back in time to kill K before the agent can capture and imprison him. When K (and all of his influence on the world) dissolves away, only J remembers him, which sends him back in time to 1969 to save his partner.

WHY YOU MIGHT LIKE IT: The formula hasn't changed much. Will Smith does a really good Will Smith impression, and most of his wisecracks are amusing. There are some standard ""fish out of water"" jokes when K goes back to the less-than-tolerant 60's, but that is far less obtrusive than it could be. The weapons, the creatures, the special effects, and the slap-happy plotting are great, chewy fun, like a B-movie with an A-movie budget. In other words, this movie walks pretty much the same lines as its predecessors, and it does so with a comforting and addictive flair.

WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT: If you are a person who thinks more than he feels, you'll very quickly notice some gaping holes in the plot, most of which yawn wide open in the third act. Movies that involve time travel usually have to dance around shaky logic, but this film doesn't even bother with that. At a key moment in the plot -- the final climax -- J uses his time travel device in a way that doesn't even TRY to make sense. The screenwriters must have known this, because the scene moves too fast for any viewer to really stop and understand it. Then the story very quickly shifts into heartstrings territory, providing the audience with a conclusion that is so sweetly sad that it is nearly emotional enough to distract from the fact that it, too, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

Adding to the story's befuddlement is the addition of an alien character named Griffin. A fifth-dimensional being, Griffin is able to view and exist in multiple timelines at the same time, making him both omnipresent and omniscient. He is essentially God, if God were an effeminate voyeur with a cold. As a God-like character, Griffin acts as a double-barreled deus ex machina. He provides the story with more than a few easy outs, but the solutions he provide raise further questions that the movie is in too much of a hurry to bother answering.

It's all in good silly fun, most people will tell you, and they're right. It's quite enjoyable if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a little longer than you might normally, even for a movie about time travelling aliens. Fastidious viewers will find a lot here to rant about, but the kid in you might find enough reason to shrug off the flaws and just enjoy the ride.",1338249600,,2669,4.612631578947369
4752061,5,B005LAIHQS,"My wife and I re-watched the first two MIB films just before going to the third outing....

There are those who thoroughly lambasted the second MIB for being so far less entertaining than the first film...

Those people need to see the third one. It will wipe away the disgruntled memory entirely.

MIB3 has everything that the first film had and more. The humor is there, the adventure is in abundance, but there is also an element of pathos as Agent 'J' finally discovers the secret of why Agent 'K' is such a taciturn stoneface. This involves Time Travel, a young 'K' (spot-on Tommy Lee Jones imitation by Josh Brolin), a killer alien advance man for an invasion force, and another alien who understands String Theory like a cosmic 'Pinocchio'.

I'm glad that I went to the theater, because the abundance of ""just average"" reviews might have even deterred me from putting MiB III in my rental queue. I'm here to say don't be deterred.

MiB III was almost as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original/dp/B007ATNHLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original</a>&nbsp;MiB (and the original MiB was classic), and MiB III was better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MiB-II/dp/B00198X0VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MiB II</a>...wayyyy better. The best part for young audiences that may not have seen the predecessors from 15 years and 10 years ago respectively, is that MiB III stands alone as a great movie....There's no need to have had to have seen either of the first two in order to fully enjoy MiB III. Although it does help mainly to see how effectively awesome Josh Brolin is at capturing the essence of Agent K that we all know as Tommy Lee Jones; and I suppose that it also helps to establish the dynamic of the bond between Agent K and Agent J (Will Smith).

So MiB III is a fun blast from the past...or should I say blast into the past. In 1969 Agent K maims, arrests and has bad guy Boris the Animal thrown into an intergalactic maximum security prison...on the moon. But 43 years apparently gave Boris a long enough time to figure out how to escape. But escaping is not all that's on Boris' mind; he jumps back in time to 1969 to change history and murder Agent K. So when he succeeds it's up to Agent J (Will Smith) to jump back a little further in time to stop Boris.

As I mentioned earlier, Josh Brolin really makes you believe that you're seeing a young Tommy Lee Jones, or should I say young Agent K. The personality differences and dialogue between Brolin and Smith are amusing to watch, and some of Smith's scenes with and without Brolin are out-and-out hilarious.

Comedy Writer Etan Cohen (not to be confused with popular Writer/Director Ethan Coen) teams up with MiB veteran Director Barry Sonnenfeld to deliver a movie that's funny, witty and fun for the whole family. At a run time of just over 90 minutes I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.

So do indeed get out to see Men in Black III; at minimum get it into your viewing queue. For me, it will be preordered, viewed again on Blu Ray, and sit in my collection next to MiB I & II.",1338163200,219,3045,5.043737574552684
4752063,3,B005LAIHQS,"Aside from the occasionaly entertaining Jones impression by Brolin, which was well done btw, this lacked any reasonable plot and was devoid of the fun n humour that characterized its predecessors. Will Smiths lines and attempts at wit were unimaginative and bland, leaving you feeling cheated of what could have been a funny quote that would be remembered later on. Tommy Lee Jones roll was small, as expected, and left you wondering if he even wanted to be there in the first place. His once hilariously funny straight man personality found in agent K was replaced with a tired, wanting shell of a character that was sleep walking through the set. While I am sure this is what the director was going for, the effects drained out into the theater and had the same drowsy effect on the audience.
The constantly deliberate and subtle as a freight train plot felt more like the director was leading a two year old by the hand through the straight maze of a story and he left nothing to the imagination and detective in us all to figure things out for ourselves.
The cleaver randomness of MIB 1 and occasionaly 2 was missed by a mile  and substituted with a conglomerate of characters that have nothing to do with each other. From the main villains to the minor, the moment they are liquified from the screen, you forgot everything about them.
The major suprise plot ending was nothing more than this movies attempt to come ""full circle"" and made no sense at all unless you wanted to completely forget about the first two movies altogether.
I give it 2 and a half stars to Josh Brolin alone for a job well done.",1338163200,4,1607,4.579861111111111
4752064,4,B005LAIHQS,"After a 10 year hiatus, MIB returns with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as our heroes J and K.  Still keeping order with an assortment of space creatures inhabiting Earth, but one invader known as Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) is so evil he has been sequestered in a special prison on the Moon.  Put there 40 years earlier by K, he manages to escape thanks to a special cake brought to him by his ""girlfriend,"" a delicious Nicole Scherzinger.

Once on the loose he discovers a way to go back in time to 1969 where K managed to stop Boris and his plan to destroy Earth with more of his species enroute.  J makes the leap back as well in order to kill Boris (""I'm no animal"") before the future is changed.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the helm and manages to infuse the film with goodly amounts of humor (did you know all models are aliens?), CGI wizardry and a lump-in-your-throat ending.

Bringing in Josh Brolin as young agent K is a brilliant addition.  His spot-on characterization of Jones's voice and mannerisms is remarkable.  There is a hint of romance between young K and young Agent O (Alice Eve) that never gets played out.  Too bad.  In the current time frame, O is now the boss, played by Emma Thompson who has a great speech as the film opens.  Certainly III is better than II, but isn't quite the equal of the first film which was so original.  Still MIB III is a thoroughly enjoyable way to start the summer.",1338076800,9,1438,4.425855513307985
4752065,5,B005LAIHQS,"""Men In Black 3"" is great! This is how the story goes: Agents J and K are back... in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind.

The cast led by Will Smith (as Agent J), Tommy Lee Jones (as Agent K) & Josh Brolin (as Young Agent K) is great. The directing by Barry Sonnenfeld is great. The story & screenplay (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic book) by Etan Cohen is great.

The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope is great. The film editing by Don Zimmerman & Wayne Wahrman is great. The casting by Ellen Chenoweth is great. The production design by Bo Welch is great. The art direction by Kasra Farahani, Luke Freeborn, W. Steven Graham, Kevin Ishioka, Maya Shimoguchi & Chris Shriver is great. The set decoration by Susan Bode is great. The costume design by Mary E. Vogt is great. The make-up effects designed by Rick Baker is great. The visual effects supervised by Ken Ralston & Jay Redd and coordinated by Danielle Birch, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Rachel Faith Hanson, Nancy Heller, Chelsea Kammeyer, Eric Kimelton, Bryan Searing, Clint Spillers, Barry St. John, Claire Sun, Svetlana Tesnes & Yi Yang are great. The special effects supervised by Mark Hawker & coordinated by Jeff Brink are great. The stunts coordinated by Simon Crane, Doug Coleman, Wade Eastwood & Brian Machleit is great.

This is a great sequel that was well worth the 10 years' wait on. This is much better than the last sequel and a little bit better than the original ""Men In Black"". This is a well-made and well-crafted sequel that is also a terrific summer movie, making it one of the best movies of the summer, so far. Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones are back and are great as ever, with additional support from Josh Brolin, who is great as the younger Agent K.",1338076800,2,2222,4.481481481481482
4752066,3,B005LAIHQS,"Having just re-watched the original Men in Black mere hours before, I was really excited to see Men in Black III. Sure, some of the special effects in the original were cheesy, and some of the humor was dated (it's been a while since I've heard a joke about Dennis Rodman), but the film remained very enjoyable. I thought the new film would fall short of the original, while still improving on the abysmal Men in Black II, and for the most part, I was right.

I really like Tommy Lee Jones, but he mostly looks bored and tired here. Similarly, Emma Thompson cashes a paycheck here as the new Chief; she has one completely excruciating moment doing a vocal impression of an alienit was meant to be funny, but like so many jokes in the film, it was more cringe-worthy. I saw it at the midnight screening, and laughter was very scarce. The screenplay by Etan Coen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen of the Coen Brothers) featuring uncredited work by David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson (who worked together on the unbelievably bad Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is so aggressively mediocre, so barely passable that even the strong cast never really elevates it. If were a producer on this film, I would have demanded a rewrite. It's hard to make a strong film without a strong script, and this is sadly no exception.

Here's the good news: Will Smith is as likable and charming as ever; there are better actors than him, but few with a more intensely and charismatic on-screen presence. The real treat here, however, is Josh Brolin, playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. This is not an easy task, of course, as Brolin is not just asked to play a stiff and mechanical character; he is asked to play a younger Tommy Lee Jones playing a stiff and mechanical character. Brolin is in the film a great deal more than Tommy Lee Jones is, and once seeing the magic of John Brolin emulating Tommy Lee Jones wears off, there is substance here; he delivers a very, very strong performance, the unquestionable highlight of the film.

So what exactly is the film about? Boris the Animal (played by an unrecognizable Jermaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame), an intergalactic criminal, breaks out of prison with one mission and one mission only: to kill agent K (Jones) who arrested him in the late 60s (and shot off his left arm in the process). Basically, it's all an excuse for Will Smith to go back to the 60s, have some fun time traveling experiences, save younger Agent K (Brolin) from Boris, and have a really happening time. I expected the portrayal of the late 60s to be completely stale, but most of it actually works quite well. Bill Hader of Saturday Night Live has a cameo as Andy Warhol, and it's both a good impression of Warhol and a hilarious performance.

Even when Men in Black III works, though, it never feels particularly important; there's no real reason for this film to exist. I'm not saying every film has to be Rashomon or anything, but some version of this film has been done before and much better (for example, Back to the Future). If you liked the first film, you'll probably enjoy this, but you can wait to rent it.",1337990400,,3164,4.545614035087719
4752067,5,B005LAIHQS,"When I viewed MIB, I thought it was very funny and highly entertaining. When I viewed MIB2, I felt as if something was missing and did not find it as enjoyable as MIB. I found MIB3 to be the Best of the 3 films, the most entertaining and the most enjoyable science fiction movie I've seen in a long time. The aliens are fascinating, and many credits go to creativity. The time jump will grab your interest as we wonder which future will occur? The acting performance of Brolin and Michael Stuhlburg is superb, they are indeed mesmerizing! The impression of Tommy Lee Jones is incredible and the creatures are visually appealing. Overall, the perfect movie to see with a huge bag of buttered-popcorn!",1337904000,82,699,4.645161290322581
