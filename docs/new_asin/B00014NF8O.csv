8006548,1,B00014NF8O,"Ditto to ""What a disappointment.""  A very long video with a stationary camera focused on two parrots sitting on a perch doing nothing you wouldn't see at a pet store if you walked past.  I bought it for my parrot to watch, as he likes to see animal shows.

This one did not really capture his attention.  Siiiigh.  Read those reviews before you buy!",1120780800,4,349,4.390625
