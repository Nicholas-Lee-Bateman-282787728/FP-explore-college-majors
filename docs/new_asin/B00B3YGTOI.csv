8562200,5,B00B3YGTOI,"Cynthia Hankins is so great! This DVD is one of my favorite videos from Equestrian Coach because it gives insight into what a judge sees in a riders position on the flat and over fences. We all have little flaws in our riding but sometimes it can be hard to feel or see them in yourself, in these videos Cynthia shows and explains how bad habits that she sees in the ring not only look 'bad' but also make a rider less effective. Plus, the way she presents the issues is so clear it makes sense how these habits develop and why riders should avoid them.",1363737600,,553,4.226415094339623
