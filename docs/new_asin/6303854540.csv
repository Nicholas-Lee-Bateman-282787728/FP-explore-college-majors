722503,5,6303854540,"I rented Patlabor 2 at first because I was looking for Japanese anime with cool looking robots and lots of action. But this was not a typical robot flick. Something totally different. To put it simply, it's more of a Drama with Robots than anything else.
In the story, which is set couple of years from now, the robots, or ""labors"", are very much everyday tools. They are just like cars or helicopters that we see everyday. And the way people casually treat these labors in the film, further stresses the idea that they are just everyday tools, not super robots that transform and shoot laser beams. Because of such setting, I found myself following the storyline, as oppose to waiting for robot fight sequences.
And as the film went on, I was so memerized with the storyline that I wasn't even thinking about robots. The story felt like classic detective thriller in many ways. It even felt somewhat philosophical at times. What also helps this film create such experience is the music and cinematography.
The original score is very subtle yet quite hypnotic. I thought its melodramatic feeling goes well together with such intelligent story.
The cinematography (the way film was shot, or drawn in this case) is so much like a real film that it is amazing. There are few-minute sequences where they just show the scenery of streets of Japan with subtle music playing in the background, those are just breathtaking.
Because of these qualities, I think this is a movie that a more mature audience can appreciate, rather than younger kids. But if anyone wants to experience totally different film, especially an anime, this is it. I've constantly refered to this movie as ""film"" rather than cartoon or anime because that's what it felt like to me. A very intelligent film.
One more thing, Patlabor2 is directed by Mamoru Oshii and music by Kenji Kawai, who contributed same efforts on the film ""Ghost in the Shell"", another great Japanese anime known to many people.",928281600,5,1964,4.813609467455621
7854322,3,6303854540,"What's good: Animation seems on a par with other 1993 anime. The plot gave plenty of room for characters to develop, and offered a credible political substrate: the sometimes uneasy relationship between Japan and the U.S. military, subsequent to the WWII treaties still in effect. Action scenes were dramatic, but stayed close to credibility.

Not so much: Animation seems on a par with other 1993 anime. That means lots of scenes where nothing moves at all, except maybe a character's lips and eyes. It certainly cuts down the animation budget to animate less, but doesn't improve the viewing experience. And, given the political/military core to the plot, many kinds of personal relationships had to be left unsaid.

A good one, but not one I find memorable.

7854323,5,6303854540,"The fact that this is an anime film is quite besides the point; it is an outstanding film in its own right. The movie chronicles a civil crisis in Japan spurred on by a disgruntled former peacekeeper. Due to manipulation, the police and the military square off, threatening democratic rule. History and philosophy are dealt with extremely well.
The characters, principally the portagonist (a wizened police captain named Goto) are well-sketched and sympathetic. You needn't have seen any prior Patlabor to enjoy this movie thoroughly-but pay attention, lest you miss the suberbly intricate plot!",1008806400,2,595,5.340425531914893
7854324,4,6303854540,"Finally I saw this one , and I liked it, but I have to say that I don't think it's superior to the first movie (see review), as it is generally believed.  The good things first: I am really jealous of the reviewer that could see Patlabor 2 in a theatre, because it really begs for the big screen: the animation is actually some of the best I ever saw !  The animation team, aided by Oshi's ever-original directorial choices, has really done visual wonders, with the most detailed drawings you're likely to find: both the backgrounds (city streets, landscapes etc.) and the ""machines"" (planes , helicopters, weapons and so on) are flawless.  All this is wrapped in gorgeous colors and incredibly life-like animation.  Really, some scenes left me wordless: the bombing of the Bay Bridge and the final helicopter attack on the city are the ones that more readily come to mind.  The problems come with the plot. In the first Patlabor movie,  the writer (Headgear, which wrote this one , too) actually conceiveda nicely balanced plot, where an ambitious, sometimes philosophical story had a steady pace and a good amount of action scenes.  This one is a very complex multi-plot that involves terrorism,  US-Japan troubled relationships, and the concept of urban collapse, but the whole thing remains very murky for most of the movie, only to find a resolution (of sorts) in the last 5 minutes.  Anyway, this is not intended to be a mind-numbing shoot&kill feast, so it could be okay, if not exactly exciting, except for the fact that in a movie called ""Patlabor 2"" you expect the Labors to be onscreen,  sometimes. Here, basically, they're seen 3 times: in a good initial action scene, in a scene where some of them are destroyed by an helicopter in a hangar (they don't move) , and in the final fight (a pretty lame one, if you ask me).  A delight for the eyes , so , but Patlabor 1, while not visually inferior, was much more satisfying.",975283200,,1934,4.658823529411765
7854325,5,6303854540,"With more philosphical undertones than the first, this one has to take the cake when it comes to delivering a message. It clearly shows how vulnerable we are, yet how we as a society have done many immoral things.
While I digress in the lack of action sequences, there are moments of humor (Ota's training sequence is a riot), and alot of ""fisheye"" shots. Still, to understand the message of the film is to look at society with a different face.",973814400,,445,4.506172839506172
7854326,5,6303854540,"Patlabor combines the elements of a fantasic story with the political stuggles faced by the modern world today.  Much like a Tom Clancy novel, this is a masterpiece by Mamoru Oshii who also did GHOST IN THE SHELL (1995 Manga Video).
Oh yes..to break the news, I know that Patlabor 3 the movie is being made now and could possibly be showing in Japan already.
I'm not sure if it's made by HEAD GEAR so we will anticipate the great quality of animation delivered in the first two films!
Watch out for the third movie and if you know anything about it, e-mail me @ isaac.tan@home.com",971395200,,580,4.471698113207547
7854327,1,6303854540,"I have seen good anime, and this is not one of them.  I agree that pointless violence is not a good thing in a movie, but this movie doesn't even move.  It might as well be a series of still frames with talking  dubbed over it.  There's a scene near the end where the captain is talking  with an ex-terrorist, and he has his back to the camera the whole time so  they didn't even have to animate that.  I'm not saying that I expect  destruction and gore, but they could at least move around a little.  They  could at least go for a walk or something while they talk, instead of just  showing one frame of animation for ten minutes while two people talk about  war.  This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  I must admit  that it had more of a point than the first one though.",961200000,3,790,4.071895424836601
7854328,5,6303854540,"When I saw the first Patlabor film I was captivated by it's story and loved the comical characters. Patlabor 2 is everyting the fisrt film was and more. Never befor have I seen such an elaborate story of lies, revenge  and politcal espianoge pulled of so well. Directed by the same director of  the first Patlabor film and the classic Ghost in the Shell. The animation  is outstanding! The voice cast is excellent at making there characters come  alive. The musical score is soothing yet haunting at the same time. The  story occures three years after the events in Patlabor. A string a  terrorist like events are occuring around Tokyo. Yet with each incident no  causualties only fear and a growing conflict between the government and the  military, with the Mobile police force caught in the middle. The only way  to stop a civil war is for the Mobile Police Force to find the man  responsible for these acts, ye the perpitrator is revield to be a former  teacher and lover of the second in command of the Mobile Police Force. The  best way to descibe this film would to combine the talents of Tom Clancy  and Masamune Shirow into one film.",960940800,5,1142,4.594059405940594
7854329,5,6303854540,"I was fortunate enough to first see this movie on the big screen (in an indie house in Los Angeles), and having seen it as such can safely say that this really a movie that is best enjoyed in a theater.  This is certainly  NOT to say that the home video versions don't do the film justice---they  definitely do.  Even the English-language dubbing is first-rate, which is  something that unfortunately can be said of few English versions of anime.  But the grand scope of the giant-robot dominated universe of Japanese  animation can only be truly appreciated on the movie screen...because as  the American ""Godzilla"" (of all films) said, ""Size DOES  Matter""...just ask anyone who's seen ""Akira"" or ""Ghost In The Shell"" in the theater.  Big or small screen, see or get this flick, and ""Patlabor 1""  while you're at it.",955497600,2,817,4.764285714285714
7854330,5,6303854540,"A suspenseful, thought-provoking, techno-thriller that just happens to be animated.  Is that possible?  Of course--Patlabor 2 is the proof.  It is a giant-robot movie in appearance only--it scraps the machines and confronts  bigger issues--Japan's security, the end of the Cold War, and the true  nature of war and peace.  Not much action, but that factor is no turn-off.  The animation is nothing short of incredible, and the music and writing are  brilliant.  The whole package is way above average.  Not for the short  attention span crowd or the T&A crowd--this is a ""thinking  man's"" animated film.  Excellent job from Oshii-san and the Production  IG crew.  See it.",948672000,5,671,5.140186915887851
7854331,5,6303854540,"Though ""Ghost in the Shell"" got all the hype, I believe future critics will judge ""Patlabor 2"" as REAL masterpiece from Masamoru Oshii.  Though there is a definite ""Tom Clancy"" feel to this  political techno-thriller, the subtle symbolism that permeates the film  (the falling snow, the often enigmatic presence of birds, and the opening  scene at the jungle temple) point to much deeper, philosophical themes.  Also, listen to the brilliant cadence of the dialouge...dramatic pauses,  passionate tirades, and those moments of silence that speak volumes. Keiji  Kawai's haunting and meditative soundtrack complements the often surreal  and disturbingly plausible nature of the film. A must-see for any SERIOUS  film buff. (If your idea of quality is lots of explosions and scantically  clad women, you may want to skip ""Patlabor 2."")  Favorite scene:  Irakawa's brutal deconstruction of the term ""peace.""  Highly  recommended.",940550400,10,926,5.521428571428571
