1221541,5,B00000IBN2,"This is by far one of Richard Simmons best videos.  It is for an intermediate level.  You can easily catch on to all the moves after about 3 tries!  It is short enough to stick with, and long enough to get results.  If you are in top shape, this is too easy for you.",1010534400,10,266,3.8703703703703702
1221542,5,B00000IBN2,"This workout feels more like participating in a musical than like a typical aerobics routine.  There are three sets and a rotating ""cast"" of fellow dancers.  Richard doesn't offer much cueing, but the moves are easy to pick up after a couple times through.  The music is lots of fun -- ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" ""All Night Long,"" ""Gloria,"" ""Sweet Dreams,"" ""Call Me,"" and many other '80s hits. My favorite is cooling down to ""The Rose,"" which is sung live by the woman who actually wrote it.  By far my favorite workout tape for the past six months.",1006819200,30,554,4.51
1221543,3,B00000IBN2,"I bought this tape mostly because of the fun music.  I'm not sure what I expected when I thought about the dancing part of the video.  In ""Sweatin to the Oldies"" for example, the only ""dancing"" you do is the twist.  So I guess I expected this video to be more fun type dancing.  Well, there are about a million different moves and he doesn't do anything twice.  You start to do one thing and he changes to another.  I was falling over my feet and quickly became frustrated.  I broke a sweat just trying to follow what they were doing which was so frustrating I shut the tape off.  The next night I tried it again and I've done the routine 3-4 times now and it does get easier.  I don't think it was meant for beginners but it doesn't tell you that anywhere.  The other thing about this tape that sort of bugged me were all the cute skinny women who looked like they were semi-professional dancers.  He usually always has a mix of people in his tapes but not once did he actually dance next to a normal or heavy person.",1000598400,11,1018,4.195876288659794
1221544,5,B00000IBN2,"I'm not one of those folks that thinks exercise is 'fun.' I exercise only because I've been trying to lose weight the past several months. This video, though, is something I can physically do that I actually enjoy. As a child of the '80s, I think the songs are great, and the workout is enough to make me sweat without being discouragingly hard.
I also like that the video isn't populated by smiling hardbodies who've never struggled with their weight a day in their life. The people in this video look like me, which is also encouraging.",1000339200,14,538,4.556701030927835
1221545,5,B00000IBN2,"I started doing ""Dance your pants off"" about 10 months ago and I am happy to say that I have lost almost 40 lbs. and have gone from a size 12-13 pant to a size 7-8.  I watched what I ate but Richard Simmons was my main focus everyday.  I did the tape everyday and the results are wonderful!  I really recommend this to anyone interested in losing weight and having a great time at the same time!  Richard Simmons is such an inspiration in Dance Your Pants Off.  You will feel so much better about yourself after doing it.",972259200,48,521,4.17
1221546,5,B00000IBN2,"Richard cracks me up, and he leads a great workout. His routines take a  little time to learn, but once you have them down, they're fun! This  routine is arguably both his toughest and the most fun to do. It's shorter  than most of his other aerobic tapes (only 27 minutes aerobic), but the  music is fun, the routines are a blast, and Richard's enthusiasm keeps you  going. If you like 80's classics, you'll like the music for sure. I highly  recommend this tape!",965001600,22,464,4.464285714285714

1221572,4,B00000IBN2,"After becoming so inactive over the years, I was beginning to feel like a BLOB!  I had NO energy and i'd bet my metabolism rate  was at a minus 50.  I wanted nothing more than to sit in my chair.  I've never been an exercise buff, but I'd always been active.  I loved swimming, walking and dancing.  When I saw this, it sounded like something that might help me.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The music was fun, the routines were easy to learn.  I didn't stress about missing a step--if I missed a step or two, I just did a double step or repeated whatever I could.  I really felt so good afterwards.  The energy from doing the routine just once stayed with me through the restt of the day.  I loved that!  I didn't sit down once!  I've been doiing this twice a day for 2 weeks and I can't tell you how really good I feel.  If you enjoy dancing or just bopping around when you hear music you enjoy, I think you will find this helpful.

The music is great, the routines really get you moving, and Richard is serious but fun in helping you enjoy the session.

Trust me, the hardest thing you'll have to do with this is put the tape in and press the PLAY button!",1421971200,3,1159,4.148648648648648

1221597,5,B00000IBN2,"Easily my favorite workout video ever!  Richard and his team are so fully of energy in this, it just makes you smile...while you're working out! Who does that, right?  It's a great aerobic workout and the 50 or so minutes goes by pretty quickly because you don't spend your time watching the clock, but instead watching the guys and gals on screen who seem to be having a blast.

My only complaint is that there isn't a DVD copy of this available.

I highly recommend this for all levels of fitness.  Beginners can start out just doing the movements...and then add more intensity as you get the hang of it.  But this tape is fantastic for those of us who have been doing aerobics for years as well.  Richard knows how to make a work out more than just something you have to force yourself through.  Sure, it's a little cheesy at times, but that's part of the fun.  And in this day and age, we need all the fun we can find.

Buy it!",1310774400,4,931,4.268571428571429

1221642,4,B00000IBN2,I have 5 RS tapes and this is one of my favorites...there's no rhyme or reason for my preferences except the steps he chooses to use with a particular song.  Sweatin 1 is too short and I don't like the floor exercises in Sweatin 2.,1298937600,,231,4.133333333333334

1221647,5,B00000IBN2,"I just wanted to write this review in response to a couple of reviews listed earlier.

He does have overweight people in this video, and people of all shapes and sizes. I don't see anything wrong with having a few 'skinny' people, as there are skinny people out there too who need to exercise. As a matter of fact, there are more overweight people in this video than skinny people, and he does dance next to overweight people in this video.

As far as leaving this video to just the skinny people because the Sweatin' videos are better, well, I bet you didn't get the Sweatin' videos on the first try perfectly, did you? It takes some practice to get the moves down, for sure, and you won't  get everything the first try. This is a low impact aerobics video perfect for overweight people who want a little 'spice' to their workouts.

I am 60lbs overweight and 5ft4, and I did this video just fine. It might not be for everyone and that's fine too.

But there are a lot of moves similar to the ones in the Sweatin' videos, and some similar routines. So if you are an avid user of the Sweatin' videos you should catch on to this one.

This one is brilliant. I love the music; I do this video just because Richard's personality is infectious and the music is fantastic. You stretch to 'Sweet Dreams', and do aerobics to 'Congo', and 'All Night Long' to name a few.

This video is for everyone. It is not just for skinny people. Overweight folks should have no problem getting through this video.",1224028800,7,1492,4.403636363636363
1221648,3,B00000IBN2,"More great music, but as with other ""sweatin'"" videos, it is hard to follow along until you've watched it over and over.",1209081600,2,120,4.5
1221649,5,B00000IBN2,"This is by far my favorite Richard Simmons exercise tape.  I started using this tape about a year ago and I still have fun with it today!

But, once you do, you'll have so much fun!",1135814400,,306,4.135593220338983
1221650,5,B00000IBN2,"This workout was really fantastic. At first it went pretty fast; I had never done a Richard Simmons tape before. First time, I was a little slow to catch and perfect all the moves, but by the second time I had it almost had all of (the 50 minutes) down. Now, I'm stuck and can't stop doing this tape. The music is paced fairly consistantly, but I never got to tired and was always looking forward to the next song. The scenery also changed every few songs from a park, to some shops, a club, etc. All the people were alive and I wasn't exhausted by the end and had to do the tape again. Now I'm hooked and am trying all his other tapes/dvd's. I feel like dancing all the time.",1104796800,19,676,4.128787878787879
1221661,5,B00000IBN2,"I can't say enough about how thrilled I was to find the ""Dance Your Pants Off"" video among my collection.  (I'd forgotten that I had it.)  I've been exercising regularly (at least 5 days a week) for the past year using different videos, many of them Richard Simmons.  When I came across this one and decided to try it, I was so excited, because I had so much fun with it, I couldn't wait to do it again.  The steps and movements are easy and fun to do.  Six weeks later, and I still look forward to exercising with this video!",1098316800,11,526,4.1683168316831685
1221662,5,B00000IBN2,"I used this tape to get me in shape, and within a few weeks, my clothes were already considerably looser.  (I didn't own a scale and didn't measure myself, but it was pretty drastic.)  At the time, I was merely exercising, not cutting down on my food intake.
Also, while it took a few times to get the ""moves"" down correctly, it wasn't hard to learn at all.  I particularly enjoyed the variety of music and ""dance"" steps.
I found two things especially helpful.  For one, I watched people a lot more overweight than I managing to get through this tape, so they inspired me to finish the work out.  And as with any Richard Simmons' workout, his genuine respect for overweight folks made me feel great about myself, especially when you consider very few exercise tapes actually feature overweight and out-of-shape people.
My only complaint is that he hasn't produced this for DVD player use.",1080345600,8,888,4.666666666666667
1221663,5,B00000IBN2,"Richard got me hooked with this one!! The tunes were perfect for a perfect exercise session; the music was really enjoyable. Oh, come on, so he shouts w/joy - personally the whole vibrancy of the entire event keep me so busy, and trying to keep up with the step changes, that when I would think ""oh, I'll stop and rest now"", the pace was clicking along and another move began - & it didn't seem necessary to quit!
His strategy is to help everyone possible, and this was enough fun to get me to pull out the ""Never Say Diet"" book from the 80's by Simmons and perform the 5 minute am. & 5 min. pm. stretches to the music as well, making for a great overall program.
It was his enthusiasm that made me actually look forward to the music & the fun - try it - you can't fail with this one!!!!!!!!!!",1071878400,6,793,4.1558441558441555
1221664,4,B00000IBN2,"I agree that there is so much ""Whoo!""-ing and ""Whee!"" - ing that it is distracting.  However, I do like the video, it gives me a pretty good workout.  If you can stand the screaming, you will like this video.  Richard does a good job of keeping you on track and it's nice to see some bigger people doing the moves.  Just prepare yourself for the yelling!",1046131200,17,354,4.2388059701492535
1221665,4,B00000IBN2,"What I like about Richard Simmons videos is that he dares to use ""real music"", music that is recognizable, and fun.  Sure it isn't the original singers, but these tunes are done well.  Richard's group is happy, very happy, very very happy.  You can't help appreciate that and it is contagious.  The sets change as well as the front-line exercisers.

Now, I don't generally use his videos because I feel they are geared for more overweight people and I use more challenging aerobic videos.  But I got off the wagon recently and decided to get back into exercising and chose Richard Simmons to get me back in the mood.

What I don't like about his videos is that he constantly changes steps.  Constantly.  I prefer to stick with a step at least 6-8 times, but he changes after almost 2 times.  I don't care for that, as it causes me to get off track and just move anyway til I catch up again.

Otherwise, it is a fun workout!  Rizzo",1040515200,36,930,4.405882352941177
