7563044,3,B0195C6XJK,"Fabio is a hustler who works the streets of Rio and he meets Eduardo who is much older and also a writer. They start a relationship but have issues around the use of protection, commitment and choices of friends let alone career.

Now that is about it, the subject of STIs is dealt with in an interesting way and there are side issues with one of Fabios friends. However, not a lot happens here. It is a small budget affair  filmed in real apartments etc  and some of the shots were really tasteful but that can not detract from the glaring lack of a real plot. The characters are actually acted fairly well and there is a genuine feeling of warmth here but that of itself is not really enough.

This is not a keeper as such  you may wish to rent as I did but there is very little here to make you a fan. Also very little in the form of bedroom action if that is your thing, so not one I can really recommend unless you have to see everything gay related that comes out and you may find something to like here.",1456876800,2,1010,4.13265306122449

7563046,2,B0195C6XJK,"Extremely disappointing.  There was little or no dialogue, very little character development, and the main character was always depressed.  It was a very long , slow movie.",1455494400,3,172,5.333333333333333

8744002,2,B0195C6XJK,"A tedious bore from start to finish, this film still has something to recommend it in the charm and looks of its young actor, Daniel Passi. Otherwise, the viewer passes through scene after scene of a boring middle-aged writer who is perpetually morose, yet looking for young men as prostitutes. He also has a woman friend who is left to tolerate his depressive moodiness. The young hustler played by Daniel Passi is extremely appealing, and one wonders why he has bothered with the writer--yes, there is more to their relationship than an exchange of money; however, the film-maker has totally underdeveloped this aspect.",1496880000,,621,5.038834951456311
8744003,5,B0195C6XJK,"This is a nice movie, a surprisingly good acting and multi layer story building considering its minimalism on the budget side. Director does a wonderful job to develop a story on prejudice, love, sacrifice, and impact on social values on lifestyle choices. My five star goes to Daniel Passi particularly, he delivers a tour de force performance reflecting complexities of a hustler who struggles between emotions and real-life facts. A small gem from Brazil cinema.",1496880000,,465,5.213333333333333
8744004,2,B0195C6XJK,"Occasionally interesting but screws itself with too many loose ends, and it slogs through a swamp of mea culpas. At one point in the film the two main characters swear their undying love even through a critical health crisis. Near film's end, they barely seem to know each other. The film is also plagued by logic gaps, as if somehow the makers ran out of money to make a complete movie.",1489881600,,387,4.464788732394366
