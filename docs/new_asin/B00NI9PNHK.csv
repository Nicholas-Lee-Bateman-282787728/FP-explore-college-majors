8749526,3,B00NI9PNHK,I didn't know and didn't even think that all languages were in the DVD. I thought they were there for me to select the language I wanted. It will be helpful if this information is shown with the DVD picture and related info. I wonder why I didn't have the option to request shipment by air or slow boat. It was a long wait until it came. For just a single DVD. Anyone would prefer air shipment.,1502064000,,394,4.12987012987013
