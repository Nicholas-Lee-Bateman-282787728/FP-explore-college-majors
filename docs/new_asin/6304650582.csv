920712,5,6304650582,Fictional story that centers on the food shortage in the Soviet Union and how the Russians invade Alaska to capture the largest oil pipelin and hold it for ransom until the U.S. lifts it's embargo against the Soviets.  Great movie and filled with action.  It'd be even better if this movie was in dvd instead of the vhs.  Maybe someday.,1221868800,3,336,4.566666666666666
920713,5,6304650582,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen that dealt directly with the possibility of nuclear conflict between the old USSR and the USA.  The scenario was contemporary when the film came out, and still has relevance today.  Russia has had crop failures, but is the subject of a US and Allied grain embargo.  It refuses the president's demand for a lowering of tensions in exchange for an end to the embargo, and instead launches a covert operation in Alaska.  The goal: to threaten to destroy much of the Alaska oil pipeline unless the US agrees to deal on grain.

The film masterfully shows how tensions escalate, as hard-line elements within the Kremlin take charge, and the President's own hawks counsel for a strong and unyielding response.  Meanwhile, in Alaska, a small, under-equipped contingent of National Guards soldiers find themselves opposing the elite Soviet Spetznaz group whose mission is to seize the pipeline.

This picture is unusually well done for a made-for-television film, and I very much wish that it were available on DVD.  I would snap it up in a second.  If you can snag a copy of this one, it is well worth watching and keeping.",1168992000,16,1162,4.741293532338308
920714,5,6304650582,"Between the music and the increasing drama that keeps on unfolding, it feels like the real thing to a point.  There is great acting from Rock Hudson and Davis Soul too.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD so I can enjoy the picture quality only a DVD can give to a movie.",1133049600,2,277,3.9285714285714284
920715,5,6304650582,"This video pits the United States against the Soviet Union for control of an Alaskan oil pumping station.  When mobs of civilians start riots in Moscow and other major Soviet cities due to lack of food, the KGB sets out to break the United State's grain embargo by launching an airborn assult team into the Alaskan wilderness during the worst blizzard in Alaskan history.  Their goal: To destroy 30 miles of the Alaskan pipeline and double America's dependency on foreign oil, unless the president renigs his embargo.  Instead, the president tries to by more time in negotiations with the Soviets by sending in an Alaskan National Guard team headed by an experienced Army colonel to defend the station.  While the Spetz Nats and National Guardsmen do battle with each other, the President and Soviet Premiere try to politically solve the growing crisis which is quickly getting out of control.  From a desolate battle field to the inner sanctums of world power, this Cold War thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat until the climatic final scene.",1037145600,14,1055,4.871508379888268
920716,5,6304650582,"When starving mobs riot in the streets of Moscow and other major cities in Russia, the powers within the Russian government launch a covert mission within the United States. Their goal: Threaten to destroy 30 miles of oil pipeline in Alaska in order to force the American government to restore grain shipments to Russia. As a squad of American National Guardsmen battle Russian Spetznaz commandos at an oil pumping station, the President must try to prevent the conflict from blowing up into World War III. From a lonely battlefield in Alaska to the inner sanctums of world power, World War III delivers a powerful display of drama and action in this Cold War drama.",1025568000,16,666,4.850877192982456

920905,4,6304650582,"A good movie that I first saw on broadcast TV. A little dated since Russia doesn't seem so ominous as it did in the Reagan years. This movie is long and a lot of data compression was used to fit it onto a stock DVD. As a result, the focus is a little soft, about like a third generation VHS tape. Color is slightly off, also.

Rock Hudson gives a good performance here and it's nice to see him again before his health gave out. Still a pretty engrossing movie if (thankfully), less credible than it was during the cold war. The first reel is a little slow but picks up fast once soldiers are in the field. One bit of trivia, the director Boris Sagal was killed walking into a helicopter blade during production. I was unsure about the date so I looked it up. It was May 22, 1981. I was surprised to learn that Portland, Oregon passed for Alaska.",1458518400,2,845,4.216049382716049

920910,5,6304650582,"I bought this from amazon.com as my German based amazon did not offer it at all. They only offer a strongly cut version (about 100 min less!!),needless to say that it is not worth even spending a second on it. Whereas the US full length version is outstanding quality regarding still actual plot and detailed plot development with awesome characters and impressive ,unavoidable development/escalation of the plot. Not to forget the performers,who are really great. A real cold war period thriller! I saw this film/ series being a child in the 80s for the first time ...and it kept me impressed since then till now. My brain has been kept captured,still remembering  fractions/scenes up to today, without remembering the whole film anymore....it did really made a big impact on me. Needless to say, that as someone, who raised up during cold war period and in an area where troops of various Nato countries had been deployed, this plot could have turned out to become bloody reality at any second!
If you expect hightech, fast motion visual effects of today blockbusters,then you could get disappointed somehow...you'll surely will! There is blood, realistic, impressive ..but no computer animated slaughterhouse scenes, or exaggerated scenes only to be shown for mainstream reasons.. But if you would like to take a look back how times have been once, if you want great actors gripping the audiance, a thrilling plot and the outcoming certainity,that this all could still happen today, in the future, if we forget about certain attitudes, ideas once developed..than don't even hesitate a second..get yourself this masterpiece! For sure,  you then will also remember the famous Einstein statement, that he does not know with what kind of weapons the third world war would be fought, but that he is sure the fourth world war would be fought again with stones... Thanks again,that this full length version is available!",1453766400,,1916,5.079365079365079
920911,5,6304650582,I looked for this movie after some recent international event.

The late Rock Hudson is exceptionally good as the American President...believable all the way!  Brian Keith is very real and emotionally
satisfying.  Hudson and Keith work very, very well together.  The invasion of Alaska by a Russian tactical unit, in an attempt to coerce the
West into lifting a grain embargo is realistic and politically thought-provoking.  Hudson's American President is humane but also firm and
decisive.  Just the right touch and ""balance."" .  The ending is a realistic picture of what could potentially go wrong when governments play a
""game"" and hedge on the improbable...which does in fact, become the reality of the world and the sad consequences!  Exceptional on all levels.",1437868800,4,949,5.231788079470198

920976,4,6304650582,"This is a good Cold War drama focused on how a cascade of very minute miscalculations could take the planet straight into a nuclear conflict.  Brian Keith is barely credible as the premier of the Soviet Union, but is offset by a good performance as President of the US by Rock Hudson.  In case viewers disbelieve the long hair of the soldiers, I was on active duty doting that brief period when the military was poorly manned and led.",1433462400,,434,4.481012658227848

921092,4,6304650582,"This movie turned out to be better than I had thought, portraying an invading Soviet Special Forces unit with real life realism against an unsuspecting Alaskan National Guard unit.  You would think this movie would be a straight forward gun fight with the Americans persevering and winning the day and defeating the bad Soviets at their game.  However this movie portrays both sides and both nation's soldiers and at times you can sympathize with the Soviets and have respect, at times, for their soldiers.  I am disappointed however with the ending.  I don't want to ruin it if you haven't seen this movie and would like to give it a watch.  All I can say is...the ending could have been very different and there are key moments in this movie that only briefly lift the curtain on that ending that never happens.

921203,5,6304650582,Fans of David Soul will appreciate this movie as one of his finest. This is a classic cold war movie of the 1980s and explains how politics complicates military matters. The movie covers the National Guard in the State of Alaska dealing with an invasion by the Soviet Union and the slow reaction by the US Government to counter the invasion that ultimately leads to a standoff and nail-biting ending.,1381190400,,400,4.728571428571429

Ever since then, I have patiently and sometimes impatiently waited for it to come out of VHS, then DVD and was extremely excited when I happened to remember to do an Amazon search for it and then get my name on the waiting list. While the special effects of the day do not get the heart racing like they can today, the action, characters and plot were excellently  done. Rock Hudson and David Soul were outstanding as was Brian Keith. The DVD quality is superb and I for one am very glad to have finally gotten a copy.

921256,4,6304650582,"I saw this miniseries as a child and I find it beguiling at the time. This was in the early 1980s, at the height of the Cold War, and the plot, though perhaps unlikely, did not sound as far-fetched as would now seem. Basically, after the US decides to impose a grain embargo on the Soviet Union (remember this really happened after the Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1979), the Soviets decide to retaliate by invading Alaska (!). Tensions rise, and an urgent meeting between the president of the United States (Rock Hudson) and the Soviet leader (Brian Keith) in Greenland does not defuse the situation. Given the title of the movie, I'm not revealing much if I say the movie does end in a rather bad note. Well made and entertaining, though a bit of a product of its time.",1364688000,,774,4.535714285714286

Great performances all around and recommend this to history and nostalgia buffs.  The only disappointment was when originally broadcast, at the very end, there was a criss-crossing of an American and Soviet missle each going in the opposite direction; this was edited out for some rreason.",1364342400,,443,4.972972972972973

921259,4,6304650582,"I was ten years old when WORLD WAR III debuted on television. I was lusting for some good ole slam-bang, commie-slaughtering action, and in that regard I wasn't disappointed. This two part TV movie, however, offers a helluva lot more than bloody combat sequences. It's a frightening, really almost terrifying speculative look at how the Cold War might have ended with a red-hot bang.

The story begins sometime in the ""near future"" (which, since the flick was shot in '82, presumably means the late 1980s), with the Soviet Union being wracked by food riots caused by a U.S. led grain embargo. In response, and without the knowledge of the moderate Soviet leader Secretary Gorny (Brian Keith), KGB boss Gen. Rudenski (Robert Prosky) sends an elite Soviet unit led by Col. Voroshin (Jeroen Krabbe) to a remote part of Alaska. Their mission? To blackmail the U.S. into resuming grain shipments by threatening the Alaskan oil pipeline with destruction.

The fly in the Soviet ointment is a disgruntled U.S. Army officer named Col. Jake Caffey (David Soul), who has been exiled to Alaska for being too smart, too independent, and a pain in the a** generally. When a patrol of National Guardsmen goes missing, Caffey rapidly discovers the cause, and, divining Voroshin's mission, hunkers down at the pumping station which is the Red Army man's objective. Cut off by the weather from any hope of rescue, he has to hold out at all costs. As a brutal, no-quarter fight erupts at the station between the outgunned National Guard and the elite Red Army commandos, the American president McKenna (Rock Hudson) frantically attempts to negotiate with his opposite number, Gorny. With neither man willing to back down, and with Gorny's hands tied by the KGB, the world slides closer and closer to a general war nobody wants but nobody seems able to avoid.

I am now 40 years old, and I expected that when this film FINALLY was released by the WB Archie Collection in DVD, it would seem incredibly dated and clunky. And in all honestly, it does have all the hallmarks of a TV movie: outbursts of silly writing, second-rate production values, shallow characterizations, and some general cheesiness. But on the whole I was astonished at how effective it is all the way through. The violence is extremely brutal and graphic, with lots of blood, screams and close-ups on the faces of dying men and women -- there are several massacre sequences at the beginning that shocked me as a boy of ten (used to cartoon-style violence) and were still pretty gruesome to watch even now. While the supposedly elite Soviet commandos act more like blundering Cylons for most of the story, the combat sequences are by and large well done, and I might add, so are the tete-a-tete sequences between Gorny and McKenna. The music, by Melle, is occasionally shrill and discordant, but with its brooding synthesizers also evocative and reminiscent of Tangerine Dream's score for THE KEEP (another Robert Prosky film). And the acting deserves special mention. While I found it hard to get to know either Voroshin or Caffey very well, I was extremely impressed by Rock Hudson's performance: his deep-voiced, hard-mannered self-assurance crumble by degrees as he sees the whole world slide closer and closer toward the abyss. Brian Keith is also very good as the hamstrung Gorny. And Robert Prosky is, well, Robert Prosky -- always a delight. Hell, this flick even has Herbert Jefferson in it (you can't go wrong with ""Boomer"" from the old BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.)

It would be easy to nitpick more flaws, but also pointless, because on the whole, WORLD WAR III does exactly what it says it will -- make the viewer watch as intelligent, dedicated men make one miscalculation after another until there seems absolutely nothing left to do but push the button. The Cold War is long over, but the lingering fear of looking out a window and seeing a mushroom cloud bloom over the city remains...and its just that fear, skillfully and responsibly exploited, that makes going to this particular war so much horrifying fun.",1358121600,46,4069,4.918486171761281
921260,4,6304650582,"A good film with an unexpected ending. Not the typical rah rah, pump up the USA propaganda common to this time.

I just don't understand why so much junk is put on DVD and actual movies , like this one with some substance lanquish away on VHS only.  It simply amazes me.  This is an excellent story with quality actors that reflects a potential war developing based on limited resources and government problems.  So much more realistic than some of the absurd trash produced by many studios today.",1345075200,3,438,4.636363636363637
921329,4,6304650582,"This is definitely an 80s movie, and the acting is spotty in places, but the underlying story works well.  The ending is overblown (typical of most 80s films) but the majority of the film works well as long as you don't know much about combat tactics, or forget about them if you do.  Brian Keith does an exceptional job as the Russian negotiator, which compensates for some of the overacting in other scenes.

Despite its bumps, the story is compelling and World War 3 makes for a good contribution towards the 80s Cold War genre.",1344470400,,531,4.568421052631579
921330,1,6304650582,"At last they released it on DVD. But it is a shame...

One star not for the movie. It's very good to watch even today. It is one of the few works besided Starsky & Hutch for which David Soul is remembered. The story is good, well played, well acted. Bery good for a made-for-TV movie.

However, why the one star rating? It is for the awful quality of the release. Absoutely no subtitles; abolutely no image treatment. Just to make an example, thefour classis Irwin Allen shows were remastered, and their image is incredibly good, crisp, shiny. For this release, they simply released it without any treatment at all. The image is just sh..t.

And releasing it without subtitles... Gosh,, Talk about being cheap.

At any rate, I am trying to teach my 16 year old son about the ""Cold War"" and my many years of military service during that period.

On the other side, the role America played in this war and its ""unofficial""  support to Israel beyond  this invasion.

His emotional scenes (the one with David Soul on the phone, and the one in the war room deciding not to recall the bombers) towards the end of the movie were very convincing.  David Soul also gives a top notch performance.

The intensity and tension grows in this well paced movie, and makes ""one"" ponder just how fragile the balancing act is in keeping the lid on when it comes to preventing an all out nuclear war.

Decades later, i found it on Amazon and, still being in possession of a vcr, obtained the tapes and watched it recently.  This is one of the greatest miniseries scripts ive ever seen in terms of the constant one-upmanship and escalating tension.  A crack team of Soviet paratroopers has covertly invaded Alaska with the goal of seizing an important Alaskan oil pumping station in a KGB scheme to blackmail the us into rescinding its grain embargo.  David Soul is the troubled Colonel, exiled to Alaska, who must redeem himself leading a ragtag band of national guardsmen against a superior armed force.  He communicates with the President, played with fierce intelligence by Rock Hudson in one of his best roles (compare this engaged, whip-smart leader with the current clowns we have running for president).  The superpowers are caught in a world of hellish game theory, where a seemingly logical move results in unexpected and frightening consequences, as the desperate players attempt to avoid nuclear war.  The story is gripping, the acting is mostly above average for a tv movie, and the dialogue does not patronize.  Granted, this is a movie of its time, the world situation it represents is somewhat dated....but if the ending doesnt move you in some way, then probably little else will.
