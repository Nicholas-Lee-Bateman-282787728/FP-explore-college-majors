8118321,5,B000F6ZBOE,"Summarizes a series of failures caused by poor design, maintenance, and/or installation, as well as the corrective actions taken afterwards.

1)A grain elevator exploded Dec. of 1977 in Westwego, LA on a low humidity day, killing 36.  Led to much greater monitoring of bucket elevators (eg. 700 monitoring points in one location), and suppression of explosion via quickly adding an inert gas.  Also led to facility redesign - no more staffing atop the elevators, and facilities were spread out more.

2)Scoharie Creek bridge in N.Y. collapsed in 1987, killing 10 people.  Large floods had pushed the protective rocks (rip-rap) away and scoured bed in front of the piers.  Now scouring is regularly monitored.

3)In 1996 the ship ""Bright Field,"" with a history of engine problems crashed into a New Orleans wharf holding a riverside shopping mall.  Oil pressure problems had shut off the engine.  No fatalities; the crew couldn't hear the command to drop anchor.  Now several mall and riverside alert systems are in effect.

4)The British R101 airship crashed and burned on its maiden voyage.  Its hydrogen-containing gasbags were made from cow intestines stitched together, and leaked.  During a storm the top of the ship's covering ripped off, and the wind opened numerous holes in the gasbags.  Forty-eight of the 56 passengers were killed; the program was abandoned.

5)In 1979 the Rosemount, Ill. arena collapsed during construction, killing five workers.  Over half the bolts in the roof were missing, and about half of those installed lacked nuts.  The same design was rebuilt with a different contractor, and has succeeded for over 20 years.",1225670400,7,1648,5.181818181818182
