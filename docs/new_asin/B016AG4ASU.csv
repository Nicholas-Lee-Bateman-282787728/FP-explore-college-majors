8736077,5,B016AG4ASU,"Probably her best DVD.  Some repetition from her others, but some new information also and well worth the expense.  Was delivered in time as promised.",1473292800,3,150,4.96
8736078,5,B016AG4ASU,"I have a number of artist's DVD's that have almost the same wet in wet approach to painting, with water and pigment going helter skelter from the top to the bottom of the page!  Not so for this lovely UK Artist!  She has and maintains complete control of the water and pigments at all times during the presentation.  Back to the previous artist's...They use sooo much water that you have to epoxy the paper to the board to keep it from turning into a POTATO CHIP, and that forces them to use 300lb. paper to keep the paper from going crazy.  Jean on the other hand, uses 140lb. paper with no curling because she does not need to use a gallon of water on the page just to get started.  FRISKET!  She does not need it!  She has complete control of the brush and paint, and if there is a large white spot that is distracting, she will just brush over it and let the wash have its way.  She is very adept at explaining succinctly what her next stroke will entail, in the successful completion of the work!  And she is very easy to understand, as she does not have a thick Cockney Accent that you have to claw through in order to  get to what is being said!  I love the fact that three brushes are all she needs to paint with!
And these slosh and slop watercolorists that use 2.5 inch wide chisel brush to do the whole painting, bother me in their impressionist approach to ""What the heck is going on?"" approach to painting, yet you see 200 brushes around the shop being ignored.
Jean uses two brushes...a round and a rigger for the complete painting!  She has complete control of detail and subject as well utilizing a realist/impressionist approach to her style!  After watching one video, I know what colors, brushes, and paper to use, and what attitude I need to exhibit before and after each event!  I highly recommend this lovely lady painter to anybody wanting a fresh look at painting any subject!",1467072000,27,1900,4.406876790830945
8736079,5,B016AG4ASU,"This is, in my opinion, one of her best DVDs. I loved it and replay time and time again to really study how she handles her brushes , the paint and the water.",1464566400,8,158,3.8181818181818183
8736080,5,B016AG4ASU,"This is my third Jean Haines DVD and it is glorious. I have to disagree with a previous reviewer the content here is fresh, new and adds information and great tips for water-colorists of all levels. While the start of the DVD includes familiar warm-up exercises, Jean added a new idea to them; use colors that don't usually work together. This gives the artist information about colors and their behavior. Of note is Jean's tip on moving from a small format to a larger more finished work. For me her style has really taught me the value of patience, putting away the hairdryer and letting the watercolor dry naturally really is fun. The time allows the artist to see the work as it develops and provides information for what direction to take. I also adore Jean's sunny disposition and find it contagious. (love the background nature soundtrack, you'll have to see the DVD to know what that means.)
**my one quibble with the DVD is with the camera work. I found it a little distracting at times as it would linger on the subject while Jean was applying paint to paper and talking about what she was doing. By the time the camera switched to her work, it was done. Had to catch myself from yelling wait wait, show that again., Luckily, Jean's style allows the viewer to see it again throughout the work.
**for the next DVD, I'd suggest experimenting with camera work/angles. I've always like the mirror above the artist demo setting. (as long as the artist doesn't lean in too far and obstruct the view...defeating the purpose (lol).

All in all, a wonderful DVD to add to my Jean Haines collection. I am anxiously waiting on the release of her new book in August.
I highly recommend this DVD and all Jean's DVD's. They make learning fun.",1456358400,18,1738,4.606451612903226
8736081,5,B016AG4ASU,"Excellent! Free flowing, wet, inspiring video. The DVD is not a tight, technical approach to watercolor but an encouraging focus on loose, color usage.",1456272000,6,151,5.333333333333333
8736082,2,B016AG4ASU,"I love Jean Haines.  I own every book she has written and every DVD she has made.  I love her work.  I love the way she paints.
The problems is it's the same old, same old.  I realize she paints in a very specific style so it will be the 'same old' in that respect but I feel that by now she should delve into more advanced work.  Complete a complex painting-a gallery worthy painting.  I'd like to see her do a detailed full sized painting.  I'd like to see her do an entire DVD on how to paint all different kinds of flowers.  Or animals.  Or landscapes.  I want to see more than what I see as a rehash of previous DVD's.
Sorry Jean.  I want to see  Jean Haines: Advanced Florals DVD or Jean Haines: How to Tackle Any Painting Subject when you can't draw that well...or How to Paint Anything the Jean Haines way and get great results.
BTW, I think her Amazing Way DVD is her best.",1453593600,33,882,4.093567251461988
