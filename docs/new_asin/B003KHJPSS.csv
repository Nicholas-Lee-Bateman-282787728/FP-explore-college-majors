8398711,5,B003KHJPSS,"It took me a long time to find this film, which I found to be a very creative and very good horror film, I received it promptly but I MADE THE ERROR and did not see if my DVD player was compatible with its format ( my dvd is quite old)  I am very tech ignorant , however  it can be played on one of my computers but my eye sight is not excellent . If you love horror films this is a must. Seller is great at promptly returning any questions regarding their product.",1516320000,,465,3.8842105263157896
