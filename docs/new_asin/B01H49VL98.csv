7776456,1,B01H49VL98,"There's a full review of the Bluray transfer on bluray.com and sadly it appears that the transfer quality is VERY poor and you are better off just sticking with the DVD transfer if it's cheaper.  This really upsets me as the plot in this miniseries is WAY better than Cameron's Titanic and especially Julian Fellowes' abysmal 2012 miniseries and I was really looking forward to being able to watch this in full HD.  But I guess I was dumb to think that a quality transfer could be made for a 1996 TV miniseries that has been completely overshadowed by the 1997 movie.  And now I'm going to have to send the thing back for a refund, great...",1471996800,,640,4.452991452991453
7776457,5,B01H49VL98,Two parts in full HD. Not sure if it's a zoomed 4 x 3 conversion but the intro looks great. Hope Mill Creek does Charlie's Angels like this too!,1471046400,,144,4.0
7776458,5,B01H49VL98,"Same story but acted superbly. George C. Scott was great as Capt. Smith. People forget there was one other version of TITANIC not called TITANIC a ""Night to Remember.",1492646400,,166,4.758620689655173
7776459,1,B01H49VL98,Awful badly acted rubbish. How people could give this 5 stars is beyond me.,1485993600,,75,4.428571428571429
7776460,5,B01H49VL98,"I now have all three versions of this movie (DeCaprio/Winslet) 1997, (Webb/Stanwyck) 1953, and the Titanic mini series (George C. Scott) from 2012. This is the second best of the three.  Being a ""Historic Purist"", I prefer the 1953 edition with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.",1484524800,3,279,5.065217391304348
7776461,2,B01H49VL98,"This was basically a soap opera. A whole bunch of scandal, characters you can't respect and definitely not enough attention to detail. The titanic itself was nothing but a backdrop to a terrible plot. It was neat to have a few more details come to life in a mildly different way, but as a long time admirer of the titanic via books, documentaries and movies, I have to say this was just awful.",1480032000,3,393,4.397260273972603
7776462,4,B01H49VL98,"Just one of many movies made that deals with the tragedy of Titanic.  Like the stars in this one much better than in some of the earlier and even later versions now available on DVD.  As usual George C.Scott turns in a stellar performance.  Although criticized by many in his later years for being outspoken and standing up for his personal political beliefs, he was a fine actor who gave the movie going public outstanding performances in each of his adventures.",1478995200,,463,4.691358024691358
7776463,5,B01H49VL98,Very interesting mini-series.  Takes a look at the workers who built Titanic and the history of the times in regard to unions and workers rights.  We really enjoyed the series.,1477612800,,176,4.833333333333333

7776465,5,B01H49VL98,"Excellent movie!  It was released the year before James Cameron's Titanic.  This 1996 version may not have the glitz and glamour of a DiCaprio and Winslett (excellent in their own right), but it holds its own as a high-quality acting - and action - performance.  The entire cast was excellent, as the acting was sincere and believable.  Catherine Zeta Jones was outstanding (good story line with Peter Gallagher), as was George C. Scott (Capt. Smith), Scott Hylands (J. J. Astor), and Roger Rees (J. Bruce Ismay).  You could see the shock and regret in Ismay's face during and after the sinking.  The movie just as fully brings to life Molly Brown, Madeleine Astor (rarely seen or heard in other versions), and the crew of the Titanic, especially Kavan Smith as Fifth Officer Lowe's reflections on the Carpathia.  There's more attention given - as it should have been - to the Californian and behind the scenes of the Carpathia (great work by Terence Kelly as Capt. Rostron).  As equally meaningful was the score and supporting music, especially the closing melody, by Lennie Niehaus, as well as the image productions (no need for the special effects of Cameron's version when you've got a fine cast).  Very much worth the purchase for 3 hours of worthwhile - and historical - viewing!",1474588800,11,1285,4.8577981651376145
7776466,2,B01H49VL98,No subtitiles and sometimes it's hard to understand everything they are saying.,1474329600,,79,5.666666666666667

8764629,1,B01H49VL98,"This ""epic miniseries event"" is so outstandingly bad that everyone involved (except the baby and his sister) deserved a prison sentence.

8764630,5,B01H49VL98,"I had this product sent to my daughter's place in Austin, Texas and she will be bringing it to me at the end of this month.  I am all the way in Brasil.  This is a hard-to-find expensive product here.  I am sure it is fine.  Thank you.",1537056000,,235,3.8333333333333335
8764631,4,B01H49VL98,Good movie.,1530230400,,11,5.0
8764632,4,B01H49VL98,"While the series got panned by several critics, I'm not so locked into the actual history where I can't enjoy a fictional story. Everyone points to the following year's Titanic as being the best, but if you check, you'll see that it's essentially a remake of ""A Night To Remember"" with a love story layered on top. Don't get me wrong, James Cameron did a fantastic job with his production and attention to detail, but I watch movies for the story, I don't usually pay that much attention to all the little details the first time I see it. Besides, the price was right.",1525478400,,568,4.471153846153846
8764633,5,B01H49VL98,Different series with great actors.,1523059200,,35,6.2

8764635,5,B01H49VL98,Loved this mini series when I originally saw it on TV.  Still great today and still enjoy watching it.,1506988800,,102,4.368421052631579

8764637,3,B01H49VL98,Pretty much the same lame story J.C. gave us in the big budget film. Average tv movie,1496966400,,85,4.0588235294117645
