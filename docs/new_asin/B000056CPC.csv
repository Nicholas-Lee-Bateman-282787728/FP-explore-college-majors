Yes, nowadays it's hokey as h*** but so much fun to watch, as close as we can get to a perfect union between ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. (1966) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE!!!  Is Reb Brown a great actor?  Not really.  Is the story compelling or original?  I would guess not.  Are the special effects spectacular?  Well, the full size, full moving dinosaurs are pretty impressive to say the least.  Stan Winston of JURASSIC PARK fame would be proud!  But, a future set in prehistory, tribes of cavemen all willing to fight each other, female skimpy fur clothing, dinosaurs, robots, clubs and lasers, and...OH MY THAT EARLY 80s MUSIC SOUNDTRACK!!!  A fitting movie for any household's ""man-cave"" to be enjoyed with snack, beverage, family and friends!!!",1311292800,2,814,4.709219858156028

Reb Brown is great in this role; more fun than Conan movie,and lot of fun! for B film campy SCI -FI film of the 80. Don't try to remake this one I'll be mad as hell. There's a lot of sci-fi out there like this film buy this took my heart,it was two months after Star Wars and everyone needed there sci-fi fix back that then.

The action in the film was fun not boring at all. Corrinne Clery was hot that's a bonus there already. A few SCI-FI film such as LASER BLAST and Flash Gordon and MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE were all sort of camp B films that I simply enjoyed back in the 80's thank GOD for DVD AND VHS.

I must say it I'm a SCI-FI junkie.",1166140800,,714,3.8435374149659864
