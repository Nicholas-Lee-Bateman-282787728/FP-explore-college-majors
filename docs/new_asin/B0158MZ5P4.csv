7430323,5,B0158MZ5P4,"Some people call this a minor classic I just call it a Classic in every sense each character is a stand out for the part they play with no one taking a back seat when it's there turn to shine, all through the movie. The director (William A Wellman) does a great job of showing the inter action and conflicts between the mostly male cast when they come upon an old man and his granddaughter in a deserted town and realize why there still hanging around (GOLD) all of them want the gold and have no conscience about taking it and while the granddaughter grabs all their attentions when she's around there are only a couple that are attracted to her more than the others and for different reasons which become apparent as the movie goes along, for most the gold is center stage. Anne Baxter plays the only female role and wow she does a great job of progressing from a tough take no crap (from this group of men who are used to taking what they want) to seeing long dormant emotions start to resurface in her all the while not losing that tough outside exterior but also letting you see the women in her. Wonderful photography gives a great sense of isolation and desertedness (if I can use that word). One of my favorite westerns stands up extremely well even though it was made in 1948, have had many versions from VHS to DVD to this Wonderful Blu-Ray copy  stand out picture transfer and quality I am not going to get into all the technical aspects of the print I will leave that for others. You will not come away from watching this picture feeling you wasted your time (at least most people there will always be a few that can't or won't)  If your thinking about upgrading to Blu-Ray do it.

7430356,4,B0158MZ5P4,"Solid western from William A. Wellman, with Gregory Peck cast as the proverbial bandit with the heart of gold. It melts - of course - for Anne Baxter, cast herein as something of a prepubescent country bumpkin who is matured into womanhood against her wishes. Richard Widmark is rather wasted here, but acquits himself of the role of the baddie with no socially redeeming values.

Great effort from Fox on Blu-ray too. The image is almost clean, suffering here and there from a few fleeting age-related artifacts, and and instance or two of edge enhancement. Otherwise, really good stuff on tap. B&W image is crisp, solid and nicely contrasted.  Buy with confidence. Treasure forever.",1469404800,7,684,4.991228070175438

8732986,5,B0158MZ5P4,"This is, without a doubt, one of the more ""hidden"" classics in film. This is easily one of the TOP 100 Westerns ever made. In fact, I ranked it #22 on my own personal TOP 100 list.  Under the direction of Wellman, this cast does a brilliant job of making these characters come to life as ""real"" people. Ripe with many of the common human vices and frailties - such as greed, lust, envy, mistrust, racism, hypocrisy, and cruelty. But also, some of them show humanity, selflessness, and capacity to forgive. As if having a brilliant leading cast of Peck, Widmark, and Baxter isn't enough, even the supporting cast brings their A-Game to the table. Including Harry Morgan (M.A.S.H). The character development here is excellent. We see Peck slowly grow from being a mostly brutish and indifferent gang leader on the outside, into man who reveals his open-mind and open-heart because he's found the love of a woman. We see Baxter grow from a reclusive, mistrustful TOM-BOYish female, into a female who can finally release the woman who's been trapped inside her all these years. We see Widmark develop from a snarky, jaded, malcontent, who's been willing to play second fiddle to Peck, into an extra-ambitious gold crazy predator. One who's willing to take over the gang, and double-cross or kill anybody standing in the way of his dream of going back home ""LOADED"".  Grand Pa, Lengthy, Walrus, Half-Pint and Bull Run, were all fun and enjoyable characters. The the film let you get to know them pretty well, without stealing too much of the screen-time away from the stars. The movie was well paced, and the lines were well distributed among the cast. I can't say enough good things about this film. Even the score, and the cinematography were top self.",1506816000,,1749,4.788079470198675

8732989,2,B0158MZ5P4,"Review of Yellow Sky
Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

Anyone who likes rooting for the cowboy in the black hat will want to rent Yellow Sky. Gregory Peck, fresh from his bad-boy role in Duel in the Sun, leads a gang of bank robbing, murdering outlaws. His second-in-command is Richard Widmark, and hes always fun to root for when hes bad!

After the gang robs a bank, they have two choices: submit to the law, or try and ride their horses across the notoriously fatal salt flats, in hopes that theres a town on the other side. Miraculously, there is a townbut its a ghost town, with Anne Baxter and her grandfather as the only occupants. Now, if I were her, and a bunch of salivating outlaws arrived in town, I might not shake my hips while wearing ridiculously tight jeans, and I might not repeatedly bend over to get water where the boys always hang out. Then again, if she avoided them altogether, she wouldnt get to flirt with Gregory Peck, late at night, alone in the barn, where no one is around to help her if she needs it. . . I didn't like her characters repeatedly stupid behavior, and that kind of dampened my enjoyment of the movie. Anne Baxter aside, there are a couple of exciting shoot outs, so if you like Peck, Widmark, or westerns in general, you can rent this one. Its not the best, but you could do a lot worse.",1502323200,,1331,4.341365461847389
8732990,4,B0158MZ5P4,"Solid entry from Fox's post-war team - director Wellman, composer Newman, and a sterling cast. I love the description on Amazon Prime, it seems to be the IMDB text, but ripped from some studio promo from 1948: ""A pistol-packing tomboy and her grandfather discover a band of bank robbing bandits taking refuge in the neighboring ghost town."" That pretty much sums it up, but what is great about this lesser-known entry from the Helmer of the great Ox-Bow Incident is, natch, the aforementioned cast. Gregory Peck, at this point had already established himself as a major star, as had Richard Widmark, so to them share screen time is awesome, and they deliver the goods. Writing is solid, and the wonderful Anne Baxter is every bit the tomboy her character is written to be. What makes this film -- the secret ingredient -- is the great location photography in, I am guessing, the Mojave Desert? Either Fox built a Ghost Town, or they found and  used one. Either way, the effect is great. If you love thinking-person's Westerns cut from the clothe of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, this is for you.",1500768000,,1099,4.723958333333333
