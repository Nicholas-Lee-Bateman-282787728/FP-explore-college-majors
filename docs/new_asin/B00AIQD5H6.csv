5435831,4,B00AIQD5H6,"This arc is the zanpakuto rebellion and is a great arc, while its annoying to get the main story interrupted, this arc is by far the most interesting filler arc as we get to flesh out the zanpakuto and give them faces""",1356566400,14,218,4.214285714285714
5435832,2,B00AIQD5H6,"Bleach has had two filler arcs prior to the Zanpakuto rebellion;and I can definitely say without doubt that the volume is sub-mediocre AT BEST. The action isn't so much the aspect in question as much as the plot decline from the Arrancar climax to this. I am an avid collector of this series, but I am strongly leaning towards not even spending my money on this.",1356134400,5,362,4.5

5435838,4,B00AIQD5H6,"this set of thirteen episodes starts the Zanpakuto rebellion. this rebellion is started by a Zanpakuto called Muramasa. he has released the Zanpakuto from their Soul Reapers and given them physical forms. but this has only happened to the Zanpakuto belonging to Captains, Lieutenants, and any other high ranking Soul Reapers, this even includes Ichigo's Zanpakuto.
the reason the Zanpakuto have rebelled is that Muramasa has found away to bring the resentment that the Zanpakuto feel for their Soul Reapers to the surface of their mind. this forces Ichigo and the thirteen court guard squads to fight their own Zanpakuto and even have to destroy the Zanpakuto.",1462752000,,660,5.177570093457944

5435841,5,B00AIQD5H6,"On my way to a complete collection of Bleach. The Zanpakuto arc is better than the Bounts arc, but not as good as the main Aizen story line and not as interesting as the Visord history, but I need all of it. Just disappointed they couldn't end up doing the entire manga in animation - why?- look at One Piece for crying out loud. Maybe they will one day (it took seven years to get back and finish Inuyasha.)",1451779200,,408,4.177215189873418

5435862,5,B00AIQD5H6,though they started a new story and haven't finished the main story.  Irritating me though when they do that.  but this story is really good.  Just wish they good to story and finis then to the next.  But then I Imagine its cause of the manga and so they fill in other stories till the main story from the manga is finishing.  Still good series.,1418428800,,345,4.246153846153846

5435883,5,B00AIQD5H6,I'm not a writer but i'll give a try i truly do love the fact that their zanpakuto's have been given physical form because it gives them their own voice and that some of them would be friends with their soul reaper master and some would later on have a change of heart with the way they felt in the beginning of the story arc.,1378166400,,326,4.030769230769231
5435884,5,B00AIQD5H6,This set contains one of my favorite story arc the Zanpaktuo arc. I like the story and the action segment. I would highly recommend this to fans of Bleach who likes this.,1377302400,,170,4.34375
5435885,5,B00AIQD5H6,Was exactly what I was looking for and can now watch the series and enjoy fully as it should be,1377043200,,95,3.8

5435887,5,B00AIQD5H6,"I love this anime, and this is my favorite side story/arc.  The zanpakuto all have their own bodies and personalities, its so fun to see everyone's portrayed.  LOVE Bleach! Always will!",1371945600,,185,4.935483870967742
5435888,5,B00AIQD5H6,"There is not really much that I can say about this anime that u can't read anywhere else.
U either like bleach or u don't I like.
I like this show but don't really have a fav episode sept for the Mayur shower seen. ^_^",1370908800,,218,3.8666666666666667
5435889,4,B00AIQD5H6,"Been waiting a long time for bleach box set 16 to come out. When i finally got it, it was awesome can't wait until box set 17 comes out.",1366934400,,136,3.7241379310344827
5435890,5,B00AIQD5H6,"This is the story arc of the Zanpakto gaining forms and rebelling against their Soul Reapers. Very imaginative idea and well done, but not, to me, the best of the story arcs. It does delve into the Zanpakto - Soul Reaper relationship though and that is interesting. Maybe not the most engaging of the story arcs, but still well above the average for anime recently and to say that about a story that's run this long is impressive. That a series has run this long and maintained it's popularity is impressive in itself, and this one isn't just ""gliding on fan familiarity"", it always comes up with new and interesting ways to develop the story and the characters. I would recommend this series for anyone other than young children (mostly for ""language"" that occasionally gets used).",1366934400,,782,4.757352941176471
5435891,5,B00AIQD5H6,"Movie was awesome, it arrived on time and was in perfect condition, i have been waiting to watch this movie for a while",1366588800,,119,4.217391304347826
5435892,4,B00AIQD5H6,"Ok, I am about to buy around 6 or so box sets at once. This might be stupid to ask, but I haven't got enough sleep this week. I see some of these sets say that the Language is only in Japanese is that a mistake or is it true? I love the Japanses language but most of the time I want to hear it in English. I know when they dub the anime here and bring the dvds out, its in english but I just want to know from someone who has all of the box sets so far.",1366070400,,453,3.54
5435893,5,B00AIQD5H6,good fights n lotta funny cuts lol love the fights get this stuff on behave of me lol rock&roll thanks.,1365552000,,103,4.2
5435894,4,B00AIQD5H6,"Chaos erupts in The Soul Society as Zanpakutou separate from their masters. They are led by a man named Muromasa. Now the Soul Reapers have to battle the human form of their weapons and make them submit. The disappearance of Captains Zaraki, Kuchiki, and Yamamoto have left The Soul Society weakened severely. Not to mention the defection of Aizen's group. Ichigo joins the fight to help restore order.

Just when the story was getting good, we get more filler. Bleach is the worst series in anime history for doing this. It wouldn't be as bad if these arcs came in-between major battles as opposed to right in the middle of them. As much as I want to hate this arc for interrupting the action, I can't. I really am enjoying this arc. Its better than the Bount and Rurichiyo arc. There are some people out there that don't like this part, but so far I like it. I wish they had chosen a better place to put it, but there's nothing we can do about it. May as well enjoy it.",1363219200,7,971,4.3646408839779
5435895,5,B00AIQD5H6,I love bleach and i am a collector if you like action and a great story this is the anime for you the filler arcs are somewhat inconvenient due to they show up at bad times but most of them are really good.,1363219200,,206,3.813953488372093
5435896,4,B00AIQD5H6,This filler arc is actually entertaining.  First of all has some great battles.  Fun to see faces for everyones zanbaktu.  Good fights.,1363132800,,135,5.045454545454546

5435898,5,B00AIQD5H6,I am obsessed with this series and I will continue to buy every box set to come out. This is a good set that gets right to the point with not a lot of filler.,1362700800,,158,3.5428571428571427
5435899,5,B00AIQD5H6,anything that has to do with anime is worth buying a good addition to my bleach collection. awaiting next set,1361836800,,109,4.5
5435900,4,B00AIQD5H6,"Bleach Uncut Sets 11-15 are only available in fullscreen here in the US. Almost half the screen is cropped out on any given episode, so calling it ""Uncut"" seems a bit dishonest

Uncut Vol 16 will be the first Bleach DVD in widescreen format (not counting movies)

According to various listings on Amazon, iTunes and Viz Media, I've made a chart comparing the stats of different Bleach TV releases in the US.

Volumes 01-10  :: Native Fullscreen  :: DVD only
Volumes 11-15  :: Cropped Fullscreen :: DVD only
Volumes 16-END :: Native Widescreen  :: DVD only

Edit:
All episodes of Bleach TV are made in 480p, meaning no blu rays.

While the episode content itself may be ""uncut"", my understanding is that the ending animations are replaced with slideshow credits.",1360627200,14,761,4.792307692307692
5435901,2,B00AIQD5H6,"Has nothing to do with the main story line, might be worth a third of the list price just to see it once.  On the plus side it does look like this filler arc will be contained entirely in two of these sets with no canon being on the back end of a set so they can be avoided.",1358208000,2,274,3.6440677966101696
