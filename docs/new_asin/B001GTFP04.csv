8602423,5,B001GTFP04,I really enjoyed this show but it was a little shorter than I would have liked. The Devilishly Hot Limited Holiday Collector's Set is the best buy cause it has all kinds of extras that the other sets don't have.,1266364800,2,211,4.3
8602424,4,B001GTFP04,"this is an incredibly fun show, even in its darker later episodes, its impossible not to love these guys, (we especially love greg ayres performance with his oh so manly devil voice), violent nuns, wimpy devil, and the comical pervy scientist with all the answers. theres sooooo much more to this show it's well worth the watch!",1259798400,2,328,4.771929824561403
