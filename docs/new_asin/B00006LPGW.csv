1786290,5,B00006LPGW,"This is one of the best Hamtaro DVDs.  Of all the DVDs in the series, why somebody would hate this one boggles the mind.  The first episode on the disc is the one where Jingle, the ever-popular wandering minstrel Ham-Ham, makes his debut.  That episode alone was one of the best in the entire first season of the show.  The Christmas and Winter-themed episodes also on the disc are great for holiday viewing, or if you want to get a taste of December in the middle of July.  Defintely one of my favorite anime DVDs.",1068336000,4,515,4.378947368421053
