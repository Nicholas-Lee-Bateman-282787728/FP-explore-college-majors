8643654,4,B00INI6HP8,"Edit, 2/8/16: Sentai Filmworks is rereleasing Higurashi seasons 1 - 3 on DVD and Blu-ray in North America. While I still think this is a great set, and I don't regret buying it in any way, I recommend supporting the new regional releases so we can get more Higurashi stuff over here.

This is a great box set for Higurashi fans, because so far, this is the only OFFICIAL Higurashi Kai box set to be released in English ever. However, it does have some problems.

One of those problems is the product listing on Amazon. Now, I love Amazon, but you can buy this set on Siren Visual's (the creator of the box set) website for only around $80 USD, including shipping (at least I could; I live in New England, so my shipping cost was around $10.50 AUD (appx. $8.13 USD). Yours may be slightly different. Now, the people selling it here have obviously bought it from the seller in Australia, and are selling it for extra here to make a profit. However, if you don't mind waiting around 2 - 3 weeks for shipping times, you can easily save yourself around $30 - $40.

The other problem this box set has is the audio. If you're a bit of an audiophile like myself, you'll be able to tell something is wrong with it as soon as the Geneon logo shows up on screen. The problem lies within the pitch being too high, and this is an issue caused by Siren Visual converting the series from NTSC format to PAL format (I've been told that they've since stopped this conversion process, and that all originally NTSC formatted shows will no longer be changed). This may be a dealbreaker to you, but I've chosen to ignore this issue as it is the only official English version available. It's not as noticeable during the show; I only really catch it during the Geneon logo and the high pitched noises in the opening theme.

So that's my two cents. Buy this set wherever you feel comfortable buying it from (you can even get it on eBay). But do NOT buy a bootleg of this series (or anything really). You have no idea where your money would be going, and you can be sure not a single penny of it is going to the original creators of this masterpiece.

( shameless plug --> )There is an unboxing video on YouTube (mine actually) where you can see what the packaging looks like. ( <-- shameless plug over XD ) It's a well-designed and attractive set, although I feel that some of the art is reused a bit too much on it.",1434067200,,2393,4.344519015659955
