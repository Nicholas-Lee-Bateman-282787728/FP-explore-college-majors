3830146,5,B001YY6UR8,"I felt that the 9th Company was a very good film and it portrays a none western view of the Soviet Afghan War. The film follows the service of several Soviet VDV(Airborne)troopers from their enlistment up to the end of the films final battle. The film covers events in 1987-88 which was during the final stages of the Soviet Afghan War. The first half of the movie focus on the at times very brutal training that the VDV troopers go through the instructor Warrant Officer Dygalo often resorts to brutal punishment of the men for making mistakes and the actor portraying Dygalo has an outstanding scene where he goes into a rage at the men when he learns that he will not be allowed to return to Afghanistan. Another very interesting scene is at the end of the basic training a VDV commander asks the men if any of them wish not to serve in Afghanistan that they should step forward and they will be assigned elsewhere this scene is notable as many westerners may not know that serving in Afghanistan was voluntary and every Soviet solider asked to serve there.

There are several good scenes when the new troopers arrive in Afghanistan and met the much more experienced men in the unit the 9th company which they have been assigned to. The rest of the movie develops well and you see how the young fresh naive men come to see the chaos of warfare. The battle scenes are very confusing and violent and you rarely see much of the enemy for very long which does a great job keeping you on the edge of your set and feeling out of control of what is happening.

The last 20 or so minutes of the film is the climatic final battle which occurs in early January 1988 and lasts almost three days. The film does take some creative license in this part and portrays the unit as having been forgotten about and not receiving any fire support until the last day. In reality the real 9th Company was not forgotten and had full fire support during the battle. Though the battle and situation shown in the film is a bit different than fact I feel that the director did this to portray the general feelings of the men who severed in the war that they where forgotten and whats worse the nation and ideas that these men where fighting for the Soviet Union no longer existed just a few short years after the Soviets left Afghanistan. Overall a very good film and beyond a doubt far better than any western film about the Soviet Afghan War such as Charlie Wilson's War which is highly idealized far more so than the 9th Company is.",1260576000,104,2511,4.432900432900433
3830147,3,B001YY6UR8,"Its a good war film if you suspend your disbelief for more then a few scenes. Characters that you can like as well as hate and some great action. An example of ""looking the other way"" is when the afghan soldiers attack the russian position... standing up and some of them walking.. yet the russians cant kill them even with their machine guns.",1251417600,,343,4.4603174603174605

3830149,5,B001YY6UR8,"This movie gives a very sobering account of the Soviet-Afghan war from the Russian point of view. It's good to remember that western countries are the ones who funded and equiped the Afghan mujahedeen to fight against the Soviets. In those day these Afghan warriors were looked upon as brave and courageous. But sometimes history has a way of coming back and biting one on the back side. The current conflict in Afghanistan involves the U.S. and NATO (well, at least the NATO  members who actually have the guts to fight - the Brits, Canadians, Dutch, Danes and Estonians - sorry if I've missed anyone) up against fanatics similar to the ones the Soviets had to fight. It seems that we in the west created a monster and now the thing has turned on us.",1209168000,,751,4.562962962962963
3830150,5,B001YY6UR8,"This movie definitely depicted a definitive and dramatized version of the Soviet/Afgan just as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket did.  The quality of the action and the drama could be compared to any Hollywood movie.  Even though many of the actual events contradict the movie's storyline, it could definitely be said that it is successful in proving the overall futility of war.  Another great movie regarding this conflict is The Beast which is an American movie that depicts the war from both perspectives and just like this movie, shows that neither side really won.",1179619200,,566,5.0

If you are a big fan of movies like ""Platoon"" and Full Metal Jacket"", then you'll love ""9th Company"". This film gives you a look into both the Russian military lifestyle and their service in Afghanistan.  The movie is very realistic; what one would expect from any modernday hollywood producer (unlike ""Prisoner of the Mountains"" with their cheap '70s quality war scenes).  I give this film a definate 5 stars and would rate it as one of the best foreign war movies ever made.",1174348800,5,588,4.580952380952381

3830153,4,B001YY6UR8,"This DVD (subtitled in English and with a handy paper inclusion that tells how to get to the English subtitles through the Russian root menu) tells the story of the Russian Army 9th Company in the final days of the Afghanistan conflict. It's tough, it's gritty, at times it is beautiful (the rugged Afghan mountains are glorious), often it is hard, as the Russian Army was hard. At the end, no soft Hollywood ending will lead you away from the realities of a difficult war that makes one think of the similarities of the conflicts today, when so often our militaries find themselves in the countries of others, where the line between civilians and the enemy is so thin...",1155340800,4,671,4.647058823529412

I listened to the dialogue in Russian, but put on the English subtitles to stay with the pacing. Some of the words were misspelled, others incomplete and in a few cases, missing altogether. Bondarchuk directs a good movie and plays a good Warrant Officer (which is what propershchik means, not drill sergeant). If you have served in Afghanistan, you'll notice a few things that don't fly like the bunching up of troops on a patrol, and same for the mujahideen attacking in the final battle.",1463443200,,604,4.931372549019608

I thought the acting was good. One point I find refreshing in Russian movies is the actors look like people not Greek gods.

The action scenes were very good.

3830185,5,B001YY6UR8,"I borrowed 9th Company, a movie about the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan from the library, and was surprised to find that it is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. According to a review on the back of the DVD,  ""9th Company, is the first major film to attempt to do for the Afghanistan War what 'Platoon' and other pics did for Vietnam"" ...

This brutal movie is a fictionalied account based on true events.  The pyrotecnics of battle should win an award.  The acting was outstanding.  What I particularly liked is that the movie took bullies, shady characters, and untable characters and showed their good or vulnerable sides.  The movie script depicts the humaness of the soldiers.

9th Company in my opinion would be of particular interest to our servicemen and women. Although this is a Russian movie, the writers pulled no punches showing the bribery,corruption, and bureaucratic incompetence in the Russian military. Some movies stay with a person for a long time.  For me, this movie may last in my memory forever.",1406592000,,1041,4.808988764044944

3830188,5,B001YY6UR8,The movie was excellent and everything I was told and expected it to be. A truly powerful and gripping movie. My issue was that I ordered the English subtitled movie and got the English dubbed one instead. Other than that I have no issues.,1403222400,,239,4.454545454545454

3830191,5,B001YY6UR8,"There are already so many excellent reviews so I'm keeping mine short. This film, which I bought and have watched 4 times, provides a fairly realistic glimpse into the tragic Soviet occupation of Afghanistan through the eyes of a handful of pretty typical Soviet youth that are conscripted in to service.

I think my Amazon profile may mention that I spent several years living in Soviet Occupied East Germany in the 1980's not to mention another 6 or 7 years after the collapse of The German DDR. While there I lived and worked initially in and around The City of Zerbst which was home to the largest Soviet Air Base outside of The USSR. As such I had a LOT of interaction with Russian soldiers, mostly the young conscripts who lived a tough existence on base. Based on my memories of those years I felt that the depiction of the soldiers in this mover were really accurate in general. This alone will be enough to interest many viewers  in buying or renting this excellent movie.

Other potential viewers may be very interested in seeing the military hardware, uniforms, small arm weaponry, etc. The dvd also offers the English speaking audience to either read the subtitles or select the version dubbed in English. You can't go wrong with this film which is available at incredibly low prices right here on Amazon.com and it's other Sellers.

Happy viewing!

3830192,2,B001YY6UR8,"As far as war movies go this one is in my top 10. I see it as the Russias platoon. The movie starts in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk in the rain as the new recruits are saying farewell to their loved ones. The movie then moves onto their training and there bonding as a company. Like in platoon the bulk of the platoon is made up of less educated men who seem to have either been drafted or chose the military an escape from their dead end towns.  The majority of the movie is of their training (the training scenes remind me of band of brothers), which is a mixture of emotional ups and downs and comic relief. The training is probably the most important part of the movie, this is where you will get a feel for the characters and find your favorites. This is also where majority of the characters are most dynamic. Their drill instructor, Sargent Dygola is the main antagonist in this piece of the movie. Like any good drill instructor he pushes his men to the limit and then some. To show them that if they work as a unit then they can accomplish their mission (obligatory no I in team). Sargent Dygola is more than just a D.I, his emotional state also teaches the men a lesson that they are not invincible. There is also an interesting bonding scene involving illicit drugs and girl named Olya.
After training the men are finally deployed to Afghanistan. Where upon landing at Baghram Air force base they are given their first taste of death. As the men debark from the airplane and make their way down the runway another transport plane losses control. On this plan were men just finishing their tour of duty and heading back to Russia. Ironically one of the characters receives a lucky medallion from one of the veteran soldiers. He said that it had kept him alive though his tour of duty. He is one of the soldiers that dies on the plan.
The next portion of the movie is the soldiers adapting to life in Afghanistan. They learn the hard way of the corruption and mismanagement of material and forces. They also learn that war is not as glorious as they were led to believe (Sergeant Dygola helps them with this lesson as well). Eventually the event that they entire movie is based off of is reached
 I have actually changed my mind about how much I liked the movie after having started this review. It has really been hard to come up with good things. Some of the scenes were cool but the training section of the movie is way too long. I spent a lot of time on the internet at that part and that is probably why I cannot think of too much to say about it. Next, the combat scenes were a little bit silly sometimes. The characters would just stand up and fire their aks in the general direction of the enemy while completely exposed but then would get shot after they took cover. I change my mind about suggesting this movie as a war movie, it is historically blown of proportion. I do not want to give too much away in case someone wants to watch it. I will stop here about the movie and suggest another movie because if you're looking for a gritty war movie involving an insurgency (oddly specific but that is what I was looking for when I chose this movie) watch a French film called Intimate enemies or the Irish film The wind that shakes the Barley. I am sorry that I compared this film to Platoon or Band of Brothers.",1394755200,2,3331,4.353697749196141
3830193,4,B001YY6UR8,"For American audiences, the behavior and continual foul language of the Russian soldiers is fairly crude and offensive or even repulsive. The combat action is quite interesting, but the final battle scene did not make much sense. The Afgani soldiers appear out of nowhere and are able to overwhelm the Russians by a mass banzai charge. The combat action would have been much better and more realistic if there had been more hit-and-run attacks against the Russians.",1394668800,,465,5.0519480519480515

3830196,4,B001YY6UR8,"This was the first Russian movie I've seen reflecting the Russian Military's role in Afghanistan (actually the second if you count The Beast).  This was a pretty good movie.  If you know any history of the Russians in Afghanistan, you'll know there was a significant battle between Russian Special Forces and Afghan forces in the Khowst Region and I believe the Afghan's won the battle field that day.  This may reflect that battle, but I'm not sure.  I think the only downside to the movie was the final battle scene....it didn't seem realistic and in fact I thought it was rushed.

3830199,5,B001YY6UR8,Smiply riveting. It keeps you glued to the screen. Well worth the purchase. A great look at the Afghanistan experience from the eyes of those who experienced it. It is a sobering look at a real tragedy that the Soviet infantry faced in a hell hole that America returned to a few years ago. A part of the cold war that wasn't so cold.

3830201,1,B001YY6UR8,"To begin with, go read a book about this battle. If you're too lazy, go to Wikipedia. Six out of thirty-nine of the Soviet paratroopers died. Despite the comparatively low fatalities, twenty-eight were wounded. This was an intense battle that spanned eleven assaults. This was a battle where radio communication was kept throughout the entirety of the battle, artillery was called in, and hope was present. The Soviet paratroopers fought daunting numbers with superior discipline, good ol' piss and vigor, and the advantage of Soviet artillery. These paratroopers beat the odds... Unfortunately, this movie uses every major movie war cliche, laughable military tactics, and distorted history to turn this heroic conflict into buttery, salty popcorn. All fluff and seasoning, no substance. If you have any knowledge of military tactics or even basic common sense, this movie will frustrate you.

Spoiler alert/warning: When an assaulting force walks across a football field sized area in a leisurely pace, AK-47's and artillery would in reality dismember, disembowel, and destroy them in a matter of half a minute. Still, these strolling Mujahideen over-run disciplined Soviet paratroopers... Yeah right. As much as this movie made Soviet paratroopers look like undisciplined buffoons, they also in no way accurately portrayed the terror and effectiveness of guerrilla warfare.

Watching this movie will leave you mildly entertained and massively disappointed, having gained little to no historical understanding of the events. There will be no deep thoughts provoked. You will have wasted two hours of your life. Sound good? Go right on ahead and watch it. After watching the beautiful realism of ""Stalingrad,"" this movie proves that the Russians are just as capable of botching history with terrible B movies.",1381363200,10,1810,5.460714285714285
3830202,5,B001YY6UR8,"How about the First Modern Afghanistan War.  For ten years, the Soviet Army used every means to subjugate the Afghanis.  They failed completely, as had every invading army in history.

3830204,1,B001YY6UR8,Absolutely horrible!  The Russian soldiers are completely inept (like they took a bunch of drunks from a bar - handed them weapons - sent them into a foreign country to fight).  I know our paratroopers would never make the multiple mistakes these guys make (not securing the immediate airspace around the airport - standing up and firing John Wayne style (not even aiming) - going out on patrol bunched-up in a gaggle (versus typical squad arrowhead formation)) so I know these guys wouldn't either.  Come-on ... all this effort into the right surroundings and equipment and then this stupidity.  I know the Russians took horrendous casualties (and that needs to be shown in the movie) but at least grant them the respect they're due and cast them as capable fighting men.

I've watched it several times and was impressed every time.  This is perhaps Russia's version of ""Platoon"" in the way the war with Afganistan was seen by the average Russian soldiers.  It is comparable to Black Hawk Down, in my opinion, showing the Soviet quagmire in the Middle East and many of the same problems U.S. soldiers have run into.

My nephew is a Marine who's done two tours in Afganistan and did one in Iraq.  We watched this together one evening and he just kept shaking his head and saying ""Dam! Some things never change"" and ""man, we said that same thing!""

3830208,2,B001YY6UR8,"This movie, point blank, suffers from poor editing and story.

This is not Oscar material of the ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" nor ""Full Metal Jacket"". It's a raw recruit to battlefield story just like those movies, showing how Soviet soldiers were build from raw recruits to what they become, seasoned soldiers. It falls flat on all points from cinematography to even a plot, though. It's like a 70s B movie in production values, cheap and cheesy, only thing missing is the red tint of Fuji film.

I felt the story so wanting since the interplay between the soldiers is quite shallow (when the beginning of the story shows smack and sex talk, you know the rest of the plot isn't going to have much more substance. Cheap filler as interaction, not complex socio-psychological bonding). Emotional scenes -- even the sex scene in the movie -- are too rushed and plastic, there wasn't enough ""pregnant pause"" time to take in the gravity of the situation (a soldier's death, for example, is gut hurting time in buddy movies...that's not even there...even out of creativity [starkness of war effect, so seen in ""Saving Private Ryan""]). The actors have the potential to do more solid acting too -- and you can see it -- but the script and direction straitjackets them.

""A picture is worth a thousand words"", but if the camera stays still longer than 5 seconds in this movie, it's a miracle. One of the protagonists in this story is an artist even. Does the movie take time to reflect what is happening even through his eyes? No. The story is a choppy race to a conclusion. Even soldiers appreciate their environment like anyone else, they're not robots. Behind that rough and tough exterior, they're human beings. They laugh and cry, when buddies die it hurts. That gravity isn't shown in this buddy war movie.

Giving this 2 stars because it shows brothers-in-arms from another country, but I can't even give it a third star due to the production values. It suffers that much. Remake it with new director and story, and then it can make the Oscars, it does have that potential if the buddy part is highlighted. It's the chemistry in the foxhole that's important, and by extension the launch pad for why they're fighting/who they're fighting/what they're fighting for -- not treating a movie like an ""A-Team"" episode on TV (and without the buddy chemistry of even that series).",1376784000,2,2375,4.757281553398058

This movie was recommended to me by a former Russian SF soldier. It far exceeded my expectations. The movie was filmed in Russian, but obvious extreme care was taken when dubbing it in English. For the most part, one can hardly tell it is dubbed. Usually, the viewer watches lips when a film is dubbed. With 9th Company, there is no need. Just watch the action. There are subtitles, as well. I have been to some of the locations where the film takes place. The movie was more personal that way. Consider this the Russian equivalent of any one of our great movies (Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, etc.) Perhaps this should have been mandatory viewing for troops before deployment. It gives a realistic view of what to expect over here; an unforgiving landscape with largely traitorous people, in combat situations. The film makes the first Afghan war more personal. It also puts this country in context went a superior tells his recruits that Afghanistan has never been conquered in the history of man. Even Alexander the Great had to go around it.
I have watched this film over and over. I highly recommend this to anyone with even the slightest interest in this country or the war.

They are transferred during the late stages of the Soviet War in Afghanistan to serve in the 9th Company of the (345th PPD) of the Soviet Airborne Troops on a hill known as Hill 3234. The movie is a blend of Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Stalingrad and Saving Private Ryan and has very realistic and graphic portrayal of war violence including blood-lust, but also of the subtle transformation that results in self-sacrificing heroes being made of regular young men. The visualized mountains and valleys effectively convey separation and isolation, if not even abandonment.

The R rating is for strong bloody warfare, pervasive language, some sexuality/nudity, and drug use. Not family friendly at all. During the first 8 minutes, you'll notice the language right away; from that point, I knew it was all downhill.

3830234,5,B001YY6UR8,"History unfortunately tends to repeat itself, and so, we find ourselves in Afghanistan. The movie basically follows a bunch of Soviet airborne volunteers from boot camp to their all out fight for their lives on a hilltop that is about to be over-run by the mujhadeen. The movie uses for the most part all authentic Soviet era equipment e.g. Hind attack choppers, BMPs, rpgs, Ak-47s (might be later successor), etc. As for historical accuracy, it is somewhat off- the firefight wasn't just part of one day.... it was actually closer to 2 days involving about 48 airborne troopers of which about half were killed, and the rest quite badly wounded. They also in reality had Hind gunship support for the two days- not just at the end of the firefight. The Soviet colonel did make a faux statement about Afghanistan never being conquered- Genghis Khan did, but of course, he just killed any villagers who got in the way- no illusions of nation building!

What I liked about this movie is that it was made about 2 years after the Soviet Union collapsed, and the movie was quite brutally honest about the Soviet experience there. They spent about 10 years there, and were initially winning in the early days until when we started supplying stingers to the mujhadeen. Our exit from that country hopefully will not replicate our exit from Nam... too much in lives and money has been invested there.",1353715200,3,1389,4.763485477178423

Once in country as elite air assault troops, they experience the grim realism and sometimes counter-intuitive behavior of the ""muj"" or Mujahadeen tribesmen, who prove to be an extraordinarily adept foe.  After the pivotal battle atop a remote outpost, only one soldier remains alive and is rescued by Soviet forces withdrawing as the war ends.

3830236,4,B001YY6UR8,"This is a fictional account of a group of young Russian volunteers who joined the army to fight in Afghanistan towards the end of the Soviet Union's occupation in the 1980's. The first hour of the movie takes place in a training camp and events parallel many US films about military training. The last hour and half takes place during deployment in Afghanistan. As such, the movie certainly reflect the US experience there. Compare the recent documentary ""Restrepo"" (named for a US soldier, 2010), and an older movie, ""Beast of War"" (regards a Soviet tank crew, 1988).

Actors and acting seemed natural for their situation and no particular effort was taken to make the war heroic or glamorous, the Soviet era being over and forgotten by a new generation.

For the Russian language sound track, the English subtitles have been carefully edited for a general audience.  But beware screening the spoken English version in mixed company.

The subtitles are timed to the speaker, and remain on screen until they are done talking, compared with some movies I have seen.

It is very true that all of the movie / video game images that a person may have seen, fade to nothingness when one is in the midst of human beings being shredded, dismembered or bleeding out, surrounded by screams, confusion and mental/ emotional adrenaline overload. There is no comparison. this movie does as credible a job as most in capturing the realism but again, no movie is really going to nail it.

The character development is a little slow at first but the movie gathers momentum as it progresses. And here is the reason that I say I found it depressing.
SPOILER ALERT:

::::::::::
::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Although it is indeed based on real events, dramatized a bit, the final battle scenes are, in their own way, reminiscent of the prolonged battle scene in the Mel Gibson movie, ""We Were Soldiers Once"", or perhaps the initial battle scenes in ""Blackhawk Down"" - they do capture the feeling of almost hopeless, overwhelming, ""Oh God, will this never end???"" emotion that touches a warrior in battle. Yet having grown to know and understand most of the characters in the film, seeing their humanity and learning of their all-too-familiar hopes and fears, dreams and plans for a future, by the movie's end we have seen every one of our new acquaintances except for one -  blown apart, stabbed to death, shredded by mortar fire or RPG fire of machine gun fire ... we have watched all of our young 'heroes' save one, bleed out, go into shock or collapse into a bloody mass of burned flesh and blood soaked, ripped clothing... and learn that the Red Army in its evacuation, simply forget these men who were left alone to die defending a hillside which the army no longer needed.
So in that sense, I did find it depressing. A good movie, yes, and one worth watching. But it is not one of those that I would want to watch more than once.",1318377600,2,2216,4.775456919060052
3830247,5,B001YY6UR8,"It is based on true events so the story caught my attention.  The story line reminded me of ""We Were Soldiers"" in  many ways.  The story line is tight and consistent starting from recruits to ending with seasoned war fighters who engaged an enemy that still uses old people, women and children as their own military tatical defensive line of protection which causes the enemy to create their own moral responsibility for causing their own women, children and old people having to be killed.  The characters held their character roles so the acting was convincing.  It is a soldiers tale and it is done very well.  Viewing a war through a Soviet point of view where the enemy refuses to fight by a demarcation between combatants and non-combatants and results in using all of their own people in the role of combatants was very informative.  Having been a paratrooper, I felt an affinity with them.",1318204800,,897,4.748387096774193

3830249,1,B001YY6UR8,"I wish to firstly say that I am a huge fan of war films of just about all makes and styles, even if they take extreme liberties with the actual events that transpired.  And I am one who actually does enjoy some foreign films, though personally I will live with subtitles over dubbing, especially if you throw in some of the god-awful dubbers out there.  Now that that bunch of crap is out of the way, this movie is the worst war movie I have seen since The Thin Red Line.
To call this movie unoriginal is being very nice to this Russian rip-off.  Did you like Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, or any other war films in the past 100 years? Then you will love this if you like those movies done on a smaller budget with a lot less capable actors.  I wouldn't harp on this being a complete and utter hack in terms of stealing from other movies (Good lord knows I like some good old exploitation from time to time) but this movie is completely unashamed with how much it steals from other movies.  Like there is the whole drill sergeant who does his best Gunnery Sergeant Hartman impersonation, and of course there is the bunch of soldiers who hate him for no reason except he is tough, and that just sticks in my craw.  No, I have not went through boot camp, but still, the man does not do anything except be a little bit tough, and truly that gives no reason to be angered at him for everything it seems.  And then there is the few, note really few, action scenes that exist solely at the end of the movie feel totally unrehearsed thanks to the fact that there is no one seemingly being shot, killed wounded or anything.  Seriously, there are lines of men charging head long into gunfire, no one seemingly getting hurt in any real way.  This movie really is annoying with that, and no saying it was on a low budget should excuse it or anything like that is ludicrous because if you take a movie say like Godzilla: Final Wars which had a smaller budget, it still was enjoyable because it was it's own thing, not a rip of everything that is American.  There is just no excuse for anything like that.
Now, to comment on the movie in terms of anything like acting, it is all blah at best, and horrid at worst.  Most of the actors seem like they have nothing better on their mind except wondering where the paycheck is, and the ""main"" character (it is really hard to follow who is the lead, which would be fine if one or two of these guys didn't look the same and sound the same) is about as enjoyable as fresh bird poo on a freshly waxed car.  Seriously, these people are not memorable in any way, they might as well be called Soldier 1,2,3 and so forth and you would notice no difference in terms of story or development.  Oh, and to touch on the biggest issue that bugs me (along with Black Hawk Down) this movie seriously deviates away from the actual events by a large margin, making it seem that most of these character you won't care about die, when it reality only 2 soldiers died.  Really, why did this movie try to dramatize this battle in such a way, especially considering this was Soviet Russia's Vietnam, and considering you would figure Russians would have treated their history better.  Ok, rant over when it comes to history.
To sum this horrid movie up, it is slow and oddly paced to the point that counting hairs on my arm became more interesting of a prospect.  And to top it all off, the actors are forgettable, the story is pointless, and just makes you wish that there was something better on, like I don't know, maybe We Were Soldiers.",1316390400,4,3547,4.343419062027231

3830251,3,B001YY6UR8,"The film is based on real events. Based! that is and certainly not a true story any more than Full Metal Jacket is a true story but based on the Experience of the Vietnam War. Anyone looking up the real events this film is based upon will be greatly disappointed, it is not a true story but an interpretation of the War the Soviets fought in Afganistan. Good to clear that up!

This film was very popular upon its release in Russia, the culture is changing and as was with Vietnam movies in the US now a generation in Russia is looking for the untold story of Afganistan. In fact these experiences are on par. Full Metal Jacket is also the movie to compare it with for the story unfolds in a like manner, we follow new recruits from the start then through training on to deployment in Afganistan then to combat and finally a last battle.

The first part of the movie I thought was really good, the cast is a mismatched bunch of men turn into soldiers. Not many Hollywood faces and very gritty stories to the side make it very entertaining. One could say brutally funny. The second part at trainig is also impressive (even if you have seen movies like it before), they have the drill sergeant from Hell: Praporshik Dygalo. He pushes them and breaks them down harder than any other drill sergeant but as it turns out because he wants them to survive. The third part, deployment in Afganistan is also good, soldiers life of hurry up and wait, what to do to spend time, alcohol and such. Also the newcomers are nothing to the veterans. And then on to the forth part which is a bit of a let down. Plenty of explosions but not very good battle scenes and it is more reminiscent of old action movies with a lot of silly heroics. And an end that has nothing to do with the events the movie is based upon. As with Star the Russian film industry is just making an entry into modern filmmaking and they have a lot of catching up to do, but I think they will get there fast.

The first 3 parts of the movie are very entertaining and then it lets you down a bit but is still very watchable. Cinematography is here and there excellent and the Russians seem to have access to a considerable amount of military hardware. There is a scene with two Hind Helicopters flying that is very impressive but then you also have battle scenes that have plenty of explosions but bad choreography.

I enjoyed the film but don't consider it a masterpiece. But then I am not of the lost Soviet generation and I can understand why the movie would have a greater impact with them.",1313712000,2,2547,4.355789473684211
3830252,5,B001YY6UR8,"It is a great movie of a not very well known conflict, the Soviet-Afghan war. A world superpower sends its volunteer soldiers to face an unknown enemy. Not just a different country, but a different religion, different philosophy and different lifestyle are waiting for them. I loved the fact that there were no political or ideological overtones in this movie, but more of a depiction and human face of a small military unit. From the beginning with a rainy evening recruitment to the ending with the sunny day withdrawal it shows how ""nobodies"" become men and how men become heroes. The movie is not trying to take sides or judge the warring parties. It is almost a documentary in its detachment. But the characters are colorful and feel real, the acting and directing are great and this movie succeeds where many others fail; it shows how dehumanizing any armed conflict could be.

After training, arrival in Afghanistan, etc. they are assigned the mission to hold Hill 3234 during Operation Magistral, largest effort of the Soviet Afghan War. This is a Russian film, and American audiences often have trouble with them. What helped me is the historical importance of the fight for Hill 3234, which I have been to (a plaque is now there for 9th Company), a longterm interest in the Soviet Airborne Forces and Spetsnaz, and having some close Ukrainian friends - all of them former VDV or Spetz - who love this film.
I don't care in the least that the lip sync is not great, or that the plot is a little sappy from time to time, or that no one from the Hollywood A list is in it. To me it's worth the price.",1306540800,5,812,4.456375838926174
3830255,4,B001YY6UR8,"Let's take everything in context here first. Many negative reviewers are talking about character development and pace. This is a cultural thing. America has always been highly individualistic and as Americans, our movie characters must be ""dramatic"". Typical American war film has the agitation building within the group of characters and around them in the war. Our movies have that one ""heroic"" character, the ""fatherly"" one, the ""coward"" one, and the ""douchebag"" one. This movie did not build characters up in the American way. Russia has only been a non-communist country for a little more than two decades, and Russian culture is FAR more collectivist than Western cultures. Keep that in mind. The characters in this movie are built together as one, get along well, and even the drill sergeant shows some humanity. Pace wise, again, American films are bing-bang-BOOM! for the most part. This is a film from the other side of the world, based on their perspective of their own war, and takes time to develop. You want drama and explosions every five seconds, please go ""entertain"" yourself with Enemy at the Gates.

Instead this is a very powerful film that shows how ordinary and young men who go fight are, and shows the brutality of war. Perhaps it doesn't have guts spilling out and ""mama! mama!"", but half the cast doesn't walk home either. The ending isn't something we may be used to, but its pretty blunt. War is not about glory. There is brotherhood among the young men in throughout the film, and the point is to make you see their humanity and feel the waste. This is the second film I've seen on the Soviet-Afghan war (actually, if you count that Rambo film then third), and it's the best as well as the humblest. Someone negatively reviewed this and compared it to ""The Hurt Locker""-> yes, one or two characters here depict the same kind of point that The Hurt Locker was making, and yes they are both films that deliver their big messages subtly. Its good for people who can ready between the lines. As for its take on war, everyone will have a different opinion of war based on what type of a person they are. No, this isn't a glory film. I'll kill it for you, its a film that looks at war as loss. If you like glory and Hollywood bombast, it's not for you.

Cinematically, it is BEAUTIFULLY shot. The only thing I could complain a little about is the music. But everything else makes this a top-notch movie and something to think about.",1306022400,,2456,4.65668202764977

You really don't get the full taste of the characters when all you hear is voice-overs. That being said the imagery of the movie is pretty good, as well as the scenery and combat/action footage. Almost all of which is real explosions that they used in the making of this film.

Now for the ""realistic"" portrayal of the ""9th Company"" which in fact was a real company that did fight in Afghanistan. It shows an accurate portrayal of Soviet military training during that time, most of this film is on spot in terms of historical accuracy, EXCEPT. The most glaring falsified part of this film is the final battle on the hill, which did take place in real life. But the extent to which this movie portrays it is vastly over-exaggerated. 9th Company did take some casualties, but it was never like how this movie makes it seem... Otherwise I would have given this movie a rating of 5 stars, but I'm pretty big on historical accuracy. Even with the crummy voice overs which I can deal with, but misrepresentation of historical facts is something I dislike. So all in all, 4 out of 5 from me.",1298764800,3,1319,4.495833333333334

3830261,4,B001YY6UR8,"I enjoyed it and have watched it 3 times since I bought it about a month ago.  I learned a great deal from it regarding the Russian (maybe Soviet) point of view.  The treatment of the recruits and soldiers is in line with what I have heard throughout my own military career.  In a word, it's harsh and it is normal for NCOs and sometimes Officers to physically ""correct"" the lower ranks (conscripts) with beatings.

If you are a fan of Russian weaponry, this is your movie.  It's filled with AK-47s, AK-74s, RPKs, PKMs, the list goes on.  There is plenty of military action involving an attack by ""The Muj"" as they are called in the movie.  There are other violent military encounters as well that are pretty well acted and realistically portrayed.  Some scenes are quite realistic while others seem an attempt to make an excuse for the Soviet loss by showing the Mujahadin as ""ghosts"" who can disappear into the landscape while standig 20 yards from the Russians.  Having been deployed to Afghanistan, I found the locations portrayed interesting also.  The locations used in filming are convincing as Afghanistan.

  You need to be warned about something here though...this is not a movie you can watch with a child!!!
There is a scene with and much discussion about a character named ""Snow White"" who is an attractive 20-something young woman known by the soldiers for ""servicing"" recruits that come through this boot camp.  They gather with her and take turns being ""serviced"".  The actress is nude and even the parts of the scene that don't show her completely nude are too suggestive for young eyes.  During the end of this scene, she is shown completely nude and the soldiers are bowing to her in their own sort of mock worship.  Frankly, I found the bits involving her and discussion of her to be degrading and they made me uncomfortable.  But, honestly, that emotion was an American one.  It was interesting to me to wonder what the Russian mind would be thinking at that point in the movie.

  All things considered, this is a movie well worth the money.  I value it for entertainment and education.  I recommend watching this movie in Russian with subtitles.",1297123200,2,2168,4.72

It makes me think that if we went to war with the Soviet Union we wouldn't have had that hard of a time.  I think that this movie is similar to ""The Hurt Locker"" (worst ""war"" movie ever) in that someone (who must have never served in the military) tries to portray to the general public what war is about and goes on searching for a deeper meaning to war and doesn't ever come close to finding it.

OK.  This movie has been made many times before and will be made many times again.  Green recruits, tough drill sarge, scared kids, hardened vets, horrible battle, band of brothers. It's an old formula. So what?  So is war itself.  Nonetheless this movie is of particular relevance; for all you and I know  right now there's a company of our guys dug in the old Russian camp on that ridge fighting off another onslaught.  Someday when this is over, maybe we'll make our own Afghanistan movie.  Until then 9th Company is our story too.

Well, hopefully the aftermath won't be our story as well, but that's just one of the many things this movie gives us to ponder.  And, yeah, I ended up rooting for the Russians.  Sue me.

The only reason I can't give it 5-stars is because there are inherent language and cultural barriers for a non-Russian.  The subtitles sounded stiff in places.  The names were hard  to remember.

People who think the battle scenes are realistic needs to watch more modern war films like Band of Brothers and Flags of our fathers.

3830279,5,B001YY6UR8,"It seems like yesterday when Russia invaded Afghanistan, with the so-called mission of ""fulfilling our international duty, by assisting the brotherly people of Afghanistan in repulsing imperialist aggression."" Well, we already know that this enterprise was a failure, and ""9th Company"" is a film that we really need in current times, when history seems to be forgotten very, very fast and repeated in an incredibly stupid manner. It is brutal and honest, a truly penetrating and unforgettable film.

The movie begins in 1988, when a group of Siberians which volunteered to join the army and fight in Afghanistan are about to depart for boot camp. We meet the young men whose life we will follow throughout the film. From Siberia they are transported to Ferghana, Uzbekistan, where they will spend three months of training before going to the front. The men in charge of breaking them in is drill sergeant Dygalo (Mikhail Porechenkov, in a superb performance) and Captain Bystov (Aleksey Kravchenko, in another amazing performance), who informs them that ""the most important thing to remember is that Islam is not just another religion. It is another world, with its own laws, a different view of life and death. A true Muslim is not afraid to die in battle - killing an infidel is a heroic deed, a stairway to heaven."" And off they go to Baghram, Afghanistan, where they are divided into two companies: 4th and 9th.  As the name of the picture implies, we follow the 9th Company until the very end, and gradually witness their evolution in the war. This was one of the last companies to leave Afghanistan during the Russian final withdrawal on February 9, 1989, after almost ten years of engagement.

Under the direction of Fyodor Bondarchuk, this film has a lot in common with Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket (1987), in which its two hours are basically divided into two parts. The first hour is about the training and the second one is about the actual war. However, ""9th Company"" feels more real and visceral - with some very funny moments, too --, and we get a clear picture of why the Russians could not defeat the Mujahideen resistance. Not in vain, Captain Bystov also told his men: ""In the entire history, no one ever managed to conquer Afghanistan. No one... Never...""  Funny enough, the line that keeps popping up all along the movie is, ""Your motherland won't forget this.""  This film was based on real events which took place on January 8, 1989, on Height 3234, in the Khost Province, Afghanistan. Perhaps our men in Washington could leave the comfort in their lives and take a look at this movie. The Blu-Ray edition of the movie includes trailers and English language and subtitles.

Lots of fictionalizing from real events as we follow a bunch of green recruits into combat.  What's the main point of this film besides a Russian POV?  Is it that the recruits who fought and died in fierce and bloody battle aren't forgotten?  Or that they didn't fight in vein (even though history suggests otherwise)?

For me, what's especially strange and disturbing is that now ""we"" are in Afghanistan - and have been for nine years as of this writing.  It's our longest war!

It could have easily been a forgettable ""war is hell for us too"" movie, but the characters are very engaging, the exploration of Muslim culture is intriguing, and the feeling of the horror and randomness of war stop it from being a brainless war pic.

Except at the end. Then it becomes a predictable paring down of the characters and silly slaughter of endless waves of assailants who fight badly. It is a dopey end to an otherwise compelling movie.

Another interesting note is the propaganda element of the movie.
