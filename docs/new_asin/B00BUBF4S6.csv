8573939,5,B00BUBF4S6,"I loved this when we saw it on TV years ago (PBS?) so got it on VHS. Our young son watched it over and over so I purchased it when I saw it here on amazon and it was great to view it again. And now I see that a follow up documentary was made-apparently it is only available in the UK at this time, unfortunately.

8573940,5,B00BUBF4S6,"If you love stories about tribal people, this is very well done. You will travel with the people, see their daily routines and nreak bread with them and see their bonds that are just like all of us. Living in their family, making a living in the jungle on their terms. You will feel you are breathing the air right there with them Films like this are sobering, it makes us realize just how much we all have in common when the trappings of radio, tv and the internet are stripped away and we live in the great silence and presence of Life, Highly recommended. It is not long, they do not overwork or beat the subject o death. It is humbling in a very nice way",1423526400,,658,4.188976377952756

8573943,5,B00BUBF4S6,"I had this on VHS and had been searching for a DVD version for many years. I was thrilled it was finally released on DVD and bought it immediately.
This short documentary follows a Baka family and their community as they go out on the annual foraging, fishing and hunting season in the rainforest. It's a pleasure to watch. Their life isn't an easy one, but they still enjoy their music, singing, storytelling and a sense of humor.",1381190400,4,431,4.538461538461538
