6129954,1,B00H3N3UV8,I only watched about 10 minutes of it before I turned it off. I would not recommed this movie to anyone.,1395532800,,104,4.0
6129955,4,B00H3N3UV8,"This movie starts with a humorous premise, moves through its simple plot competently, and ends exactly as you expect it to end.  There are a few good laughs with a lot of science fiction references.  I'm sure it will fill a Saturday night spot on the Syfy channel one of these weeks despite being a cut above most of the fare that sees that time slot.

The plot revolves around a video store owner and his best friend / employee who have been preparing themselves for various apocalyptic scenarios by watching and learning from disaster movies throughout their lives.  When a variation of one of these scenarios begins to wreak havoc on the world, the two enlist the help of the store owner's girlfriend to rescue their idol - an archetypical government scientist-turned scifi author who's been declared crazy and locked away in a mental institution.  The heroes must get to him because they believe he knows what's happening and holds the knowledge to stop the apocalypse.  Along the way, several friends and family prove helpful or detrimental to various degrees, with most of them not making it through the movie.

The actors are all generally better than Syfy's typical stock for disaster movies and that makes more of a difference in the film's quality than I thought it would.  It also helps that most of the cheesy lines are delivered by the characters quoting from blockbuster movies - everything from The Lord of the Rings to Aliens to Galaxy Quest.  It works as a kind of tongue-in-cheek take on tongue-in-cheek dialogue.

This is the type of movie where an 'everyman' does everything from fly a plane to rewiring a nuclear missile simply from having seen it in movies or looked into on the internet.  Yet the movie works as a fun, if not especially memorable, 90 minute buddies-against-the-apocalypse film because it is exactly the type of movie you expect from the start.",1395360000,,1883,4.798761609907121
6129956,4,B00H3N3UV8,"Fun movie, not as fun as Big Ass Spider but still well worth the watch. The cast was great and and fx serviceable.",1395100800,,114,4.0
6129957,1,B00H3N3UV8,"Really the only reason I rented this movie was to see Fargo again, but even that wasn't worth it. Bad acting. Bad SFX. I lost interest 30 minutes in. If you watched the preview, it is the most exciting part of this movie. Of course this is only my opinion. See for yourself! Just don't forget, I warned you -_-",1394841600,2,310,4.183333333333334
6129958,5,B00H3N3UV8,Fun old school science fiction!!  Saving the world because you've watched a ton of disaster films... As long as you can not things too seriously you'll love this film.,1394755200,,167,4.758620689655173
6129959,3,B00H3N3UV8,"It was really low budget but it worked, the writing and the acting was poor though. It is a good premise.",1394668800,,105,4.0476190476190474
6129960,4,B00H3N3UV8,"Director Steven R. Monroe is quickly becoming one of my favorite moviemakers.  I have reviewed a couple of his films over at Shattered Ravings, however I didn't realize until recently just how many films he had made for specifically for the SyFy Channel (10 is the number, if Im counting correctly).  Many SyFy films are guilty pleasures for me, movies that I like to watch but am not sure I would admit to doing so.  Thankfully, Monroes films are good enough to where I don't have to go into hiding.  END OF THE WORLD is his newest addition, and its a humor-filled blast of fun.

This film is not going to be a movie for everyone.  It is a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction disaster movie, and the lack of seriousness might throw some viewers off.  I personally loved it and found myself laughing throughout.  Even my wife enjoyed it, and she doesnt usually lean towards movies like this.

END OF THE WORLD is shot well and looks good for a TV movie.  Because of its smaller budget, its not quite as epic as the title makes it soundbut its still a lot of fun nonetheless.  The story is strong, and the premise is actually feasible (for the most part), making for good drama in between the humor.

The special effects are pretty good, even though most of them are computer generated.  I personally prefer practical effects, but I completely understand how CG can be cheaper (and quicker) to produce these days.  There are some nice somewhat gory effects, however, in the bodies that are left after they are hit with the electro-magnetic blasts.  The charred remains look great and gruesome!

As I mentioned above, END OF THE WORLD is very tongue-in-cheek, and you have to suspend A LOT of reality to enjoy it.  I say this because of a few over-the-top aspects, such as a video store owner who can rewire a nuclear warhead or two bumbling movie fans that infiltrate a missile silo.  If you can look past things like that and enjoy this movie for what it is, youll love it.

END OF THE WORLD is obviously a big win for me, and fans of disaster movies should enjoy it.  I cant wait to see what Monroe does next.  This film is available now in a variety of formats.",1394582400,,2159,4.4987146529562985
6129961,2,B00H3N3UV8,"Would have been more plausible if it destroyed the world at the end, lead actors were good though. Makes you miss Eureka",1394323200,,120,4.5

  GREG GRUNBERG is outstanding in this role and im glad to see some of us XXL guys getting the leading roles ...just tough enough and just funny enough to be TOTALLY COOL !*....if you like this film....GREG GRUNBERG stars another scify film, (BIG ASS SPIDERS) which i equally enjoyed !!!

I enjoyed the choice of actors from HBO's Heroes and from Eureka (tv.) The special effects are not bad, either. It does run a little slow at times. And, a few scenes look like they were filmed in one take, when a few more would have helped.

6129993,3,B00H3N3UV8,"A sparkly blue bubble without Glinda in attendance crashes to Earth, signally the END of the world!!!  Thank goodness a couple of self avowed sci-fi experts are on hand to save us all.  When they're not arguing or rattling off obscure references to movies we're supposed to automatically recognize because EVERYONE lives and breathes this stuff to the exclusion of all else.  Even for a sci-fi comedy (of sorts) that's a lot to expect.  The main problem with referential humor is that it relies entirely on the audience knowing exactly what is being referenced in order to get the joke.  At some point it's realized that a lot of what is being spewed is just nonsense, apropos of nothing.  Then everything rests entirely on whether or not you like these characters/actors and the situation they find themselves in.  If you don't, then you're reduced to watching a bunch of knuckleheads acting like idiots while trying to save the world.

I am not a huge fan of Greg Grunberg and his bombastic approach to comedy.  I don't know who Neil Grayston is but I liked him marginally better than his blowhard boss/soul mate from the video store (do video stores still exist?).  Sadly, there wasn't nearly enough scenes featuring the only actor of note in this movie, Brad Dourif.  But.  The premise was of sufficient interest.  Most of the other actors were acceptable.  The greatest obstacle was the inconsistency in tone.  Was this a comedy or not?  Why did most of the other actors approach the movie in a serious fashion?  (Nothing says belly laugh like a lunatic threatening to shoot someone's mother in the face.)

I liked everything in this movie that didn't feature Grunberg.",1428883200,,1674,4.814035087719298

6130042,3,B00H3N3UV8,"I almost abandoned this movie like 20 minutes in. I still don't know if sitting through it was the best use of my time. It tried to be a sci-fi contemporary to Shaun of the Dead. A quasi-comedic parody of a genre that's hardly taken seriously. Even some of the characters were the same: the romantically clueless protagonist, his sidekick who is a lesser form of the protagonist, the mom, the guy who falls early on. Etc. Except this was not nearly as well done as Shaun of the Dead. Not nearly. In fact, if it weren't for the cast, this would've been a complete waste of time. As it were, it turned out to be a solid 3-stars. I enjoyed the comedic gimmick that these guys were experts in apocalypse movies, and that the knowledge helped them, allowing for meta references to some great/horrific flicks in the genre.",1398124800,14,816,4.483221476510067

6130045,4,B00H3N3UV8,"I don't know why, but for some reason I've been going through a disaster movie phase this past month. It started out with ""Airport '77"" and escalated quickly through the 1970s to the 1990s and beyond. I hit as many of the sub-genres along the way as I could by watching ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Meteor,"" ""Daylight,"" ""Sharknado"" and more. Needless to say, it wasn't hard for me to get into the zone when I received Anchor Bay Entertainment and SyFy Channel's ""End of the World.""

A video store owner (Greg Grunberg) and his film geek buddy (Neil Graston) find they're the key to saving the world when an electrically-fueled storm of dust and lightning bursts pound the Earth. The two unlikely heroes use their previously useless knowledge of disaster film scenarios to discover a way to save the planet from certain doom. At the same time, they must lead a group of friends to safety while fighting their way through gangs of survivors trying to steal their van and supplies for themselves.

The back of the DVD cover has a quote stating, ""The best film that I've ever seen on SyFy!"" I would have to side with Through the Shattered Lens' Lisa Bowman that ""End of the World"" is one of the better straight-to-cable movies my eyes have gazed upon. The story really isn't anything new, but is made tolerable through characters that are both likable and easy to hate depending on what their specific role in the movie demands of them.

The casting director for ""End of the World"" kept their end of the bargain by packing the movie full of familiar genre faces for various audiences to grab on to. Greg Grunberg (""Heroes"") and Neil Grayston (""Eureka"") play the leads. They trade sci-fi banter and film quotes that make hardcore geeks feel like they're in on a joke not every viewer will get. Brad Dourif (""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Exorcist III,"" and every independent horror or sci-fi project he has time to be in) plays the crazy doctor who holds the answer to how to stop Armageddon from happening. Too bad he's only in the movie long enough to act nuts for five or ten minutes and then die.

The special effects are as good as you can expect from low-budget fare like ""End of the World."" The CGI team does what they can with the money they've been given. The way the unfortunate folks who get hit by the electrical pulsing meteorites explode more than make up for how animated the effects might look.

""End of the World"" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action and some disturbing images. There are some scenes where people explode in a splash of digital gore, but nothing out of the ordinary for these types of movies. I recall some bad language spread throughout as well.

No bonus material is included for ""End of the World."" That doesn't really come as a surprise. I'm sure nothing out of the ordinary happened while making the movie. I'm sure they could've drummed up some fun interviews with the cast and crew, but let's be honest. Would it really have added anything we really needed to see?

""End of the World"" is an adequate entry into the sci-fi and disaster film genres. It will suffice for those who have burned through all the other movies of its type and are looking for something new to watch. It's further made tolerable through the wink-wink-nudge dialogue traded between its two nerdy lead characters. If you're looking for something to pass the time on a Saturday night, I would recommend this for folks who enjoy a good grade-C flick.",1397692800,8,3447,4.613376835236542

6130047,2,B00H3N3UV8,"I love disaster movies. One of things disaster movie lovers look for in a disaster flick is 'disaster.' If it's going to be the end of the world, you figure there's going to be a bit of that, and there just wasn't. The electricity shooting from space just wasn't exciting, usually senseless (some people could handle it, some baked, and some disappeared leaving a charred mark on the ground behind). And it just repeated a couple times. The core group wasn't particularly likeable. The only thing that seemed mildly humorous, at first, was how the guys got their knowledge from other disaster movies. Sadly, the director/writer should have more followed other disaster movies.
