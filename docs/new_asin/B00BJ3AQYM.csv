5626997,1,B00BJ3AQYM,The singular good thing about this movie is the photo taken for the cover.  If the whole movie was like that photo i think it would have been a hit.  Really great photo... I give B movies a chance.  There are some gems out there that will surprise me.  This movie is a waste of time for the viewer. I walked into this blindly as I love period pieces and also am a fan of the Robin Hood story. I hate to give a bad review but this movie should be free and I don't want anyone else to waste their money. or their time.  F- and -5 stars.,1371772800,9,534,3.8623853211009176
5626998,1,B00BJ3AQYM,Save your money.  This movie is HORRIBLE.  It's a cross between a very poorly acted version of Robin Hood and The Zombie Apocalypse.,1370649600,9,132,4.695652173913044
5626999,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"There aren't any ghosts. They are more like zombies, or flesh eating undead and there is very little to see as it comes late in the film.

This film goes from Robin (Martin Thon) rescuing Maid Marion (Ramona Kuen) up unto his death and a bit afterwards if you catch my drift. Most of the film concerns the relationships of the living individuals. The punkish Robin lives in a commune and gives a long speech that makes Marx look like a Rockefeller. To create Old English effect they play around with the syntax and apply accents that would get rejected from a small town Renaissance Fair. The dialouge and acting was terrible with actors limply reading their lines. The opening fight scene looked like a cross between an Asylum film and a Monty Python production.

The editing was a major WTF as they ran some credits 10 minutes from the end, then continued with 5 more minutes of the film, then the final credits. Kudos for thinking outside of the box on a credit roll, but there is a reason why no one runs closing credits 10 minutes before the film is over. Really.

5627000,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"I love Robin Hood and pick up any movies I find of him. But this one...omg! Nowhere on the cover does it indicate that this is a HORROR film, not an action adventure as it says on the back cover. Totally mislabeled. I'm going to try returning it to the store. Had I known it was horror I would not have picked it up. I love Robin Hood, not Zombie Hood (nothing against horror fans....I just don't watch it). The acting was a horror too, very stilted like they were reading off cue cards. I watched it about half way through and couldn't take it anymore.",1369785600,3,553,4.226415094339623
5627001,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"This movie is really bad. Actors act like they are reading direct from the script. Have seen school plays better. A Class full of grade schoolers taking turns reading the script aloud would have done a better job. Script is bad, actors are bad, everything is just plain bad. I would not have given one star it had not been required so that I could post a review.",1369267200,20,362,4.338235294117647
5627002,1,B00BJ3AQYM,This movie is very bad. Dont waste your money or time. $25 for this is a ripoff.,1369267200,7,80,3.764705882352941
5627033,3,B00BJ3AQYM,Love Kane Hodder but not movie,1420934400,,30,4.166666666666667
5627034,1,B00BJ3AQYM,It might be a good story if the so called actors knew how to act. You'll hate yourself for wasting your time.,1420070400,,109,4.0
5627035,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"I purchased this incredible waste of time at an outlet store. First, let me tell you how impressed I am-not. I could not make a film like this, I have only limited funds and I am a recording artist, for real. But I do not claim to be a film maker either. The actors were all cheated by the dubbing, the dialog and most likely the directing. I could see that the actors were speaking the words that were being heard but 7% of the time the sync was accurate while the other 93% of the time the sound was either not synced, the natural sound was replaced by dubbing which was either edited by Deaf Hard of Hearing or an editor who didn't speak English. I believe that this hurt the film dramatically. The cinematography was very nice though more shots of the background while the robotic dialog was was heard could have diverted attention away from the horrid script.

I viewed this film twice, once with sound and then a second time without sound.  There was not any CC or subtitle options which may have not made a difference but having a deaf child in my family requires titling. The script was ""on the nose dialog"" and there was not any set up for the characters. If a viewer had any knowledge of English history they would be aware that there was a historical figure which this tale is based on. But, the film just begins in Sherwood Forrest with all of the characters doing much of ""nothing."" I can go on and on but I hope I made some point of why this film is such a waste of scenery and a good fable.

I really don't enjoy knocking cinema therefore I have one suggestion if you mistakenly own or have already rented this film. View it without the soundtrack and have a CD of some other music going, or a book on cassette tape or CD. If you are a professional athlete and are trying to psych yourself up for the big game or ""fight"" then this movie will definitely piss you off. That could be of good use for the film! But don't just break it bare handed since your hand could get cut. If you choose to bite it you could also get injured. I suggest forcing yourself to view the entire film and then tell yourself that if you loose your fight or game your punishment will have to be watching the entire film again! Good luck!",1409443200,3,2227,4.247641509433962
5627036,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"But OMG I couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. The acting was so horrible, my daughter had more emotion asking me what in the world I was watching. I don't know why the main characters were picked unless they were perhaps relatives of the director. A neice or nephew who wanted to get into the ""biz"" but they should definitely stay out. Big zombie movie fan, but damn.",1403654400,,371,4.391304347826087
5627037,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"This was to date the worst version I have seen on Robin Hood and I believe I have seen them all, Do not waste your money.",1402876800,2,121,3.6923076923076925
5627038,3,B00BJ3AQYM,"If you don't have a sense of humor or an appreciation for low budget films/bad movies, then I do not think you will enjoy this flick. This is basically a student film/YouTube flick, so if you don't really like those, don't bother with this movie. However, I enjoyed this movie -- it had some legitimate goofy humor and was a mostly interesting take on the Robin Hood story. I think the filmmakers had fun making this film, so I think that's what counts. Get some friends together, some drinks and you'll probably find yourself enjoying this movie. My only problem with it is it takes an hour and a half for the ""ghosts"" to even make an appearance... and I'm not really sure they were even ghosts. Otherwise though, I had a great time. Also, Tom Savini and Kane Hodder, what even bro?",1399852800,,783,4.4825174825174825
5627039,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"Truly awful. I only bought it (used for .50) because the trailer showed a female character zapping something, That was the best part of the movie. The rest was so bad it wasn't even ""Manos Hands of Fate"" bad. Just bad.",1396742400,4,218,4.341463414634147
5627040,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"I've watched some bad movies in my day, but this one was uniquely bad.  I did watch all of it, but only due to my morbid sense of curiosity.  I kept thinking it could not get worse, then it did.  There are B movies and then there are those that are worse than B movies... sadly I think the makers of this movie actually thought they were doing a good job.  Watching Robin Hood eat the guts out of one of Sherwood's finest was just a bit too much.  Bad acting, bad story, bad camera, bad lighting.  You've been warned.",1374105600,6,517,4.12
5627041,1,B00BJ3AQYM,I rented this from a red box and didn't even watch 5 minuets of the movie. Red box should be embarrassed to have quality this low. Paying the $1.28 for a package of pop rocks would provide more lasting entertainment than this movie.,1372809600,9,232,4.4186046511627906
5627042,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"This was a waste of money...and I used Red Box!!
heck, I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes before turning it off.....

From the very start, I could see this movie in trouble...it looked like a school play from an elementary school. The acting was dreadful, the emotions were nonexistent, and the music was terrible!! The script was completely bad and it might as well have been written by a six year old.

I do like the Robin Hood series and have seen most. But, this is beyond bad....This is ""The Postman"" kind of bad.

Do not even waste your hard earned dollar at red box.....

I would give it zero stars if I could.",1372636800,3,623,4.344827586206897

8569274,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"The disc and case were in excellent condition.  However, the movie is ""D"" quality.  The acting was poor as was the story line.  Look out people.  Just because it says Robin Hood does not make it good.",1464825600,,200,4.324324324324325
8569275,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"0 out of 0 stars, acting was horrid, plot if you could call it a plot, was terrible, I wouldn't recommend a person watch this for free. I spent $5 for the displeasure.

8569276,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"This movie is awful. I saw it on Netflix and still felt ripped off.

There is ONE saving grace for this film. If you and your friends get hammered, you can have a great time watching it. It is not just a bad movie, but a bad movie on par with ""The Room.""",1456790400,,254,3.792452830188679

This is not that kind of bad. This movie is the very worst kind of bad- it's dull.
Seldom have so many given so little to create a film. From acting to dialogue to direction and even the sound effects, there is nothing in this film capable of generating interest or excitement.",1448582400,,345,4.164179104477612
8569279,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"Kane Hodder AND Tom Savini couldn't save this picture. I was son angry at the incoherent storytelling, I was unable to choke out the phrase 'word salad.' This movie has made me dumber. I saw it for free on Netflix, and I still paid too much. Only for hardcore riffers.",1446336000,,268,4.38
8569280,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"Well, I'm glad I got this at the library, because I would have felt bad if I would have paid for it. I think I've liked every Robin Hood movie I've ever seen before this point, but this one was one exception. I only made it through about 15-20 minutes of the movie, but then I had to turn it off. The actors sound like they are just reading their lines, without having ever read them before. The effect is that the inflections are all in the wrong places and any witty remarks fail to sound clever. I thought it was just my copy, but reading other reviews, it sound like it's everyone -- the sound is not aligned with the video. It's like they recorded the whole move, then realized that they had messed up the sound, so they had everyone come back into the studio and re-dub everything anyone said. If you ever had the opportunity to watch this movie, please pass it up.",1430352000,,871,4.253012048192771
8569281,1,B00BJ3AQYM,"This movie was terrible, don't get me wrong. HOWEVER my family and I who are big on historical movies ended up watching it over and over to see who can find the most things wrong for the period and so on and so forth.",1424304000,,217,3.9545454545454546
