5114910,5,B007Z10I5E,"Back in the 80s, Doctor Who was really being criticized and forgotten but this story was well ahead of it's time.  It's very creative and would be amazing if done today with more money thrown into it.  It's amazing that JNT turned out what he did with the budget the BBC gave him.  The cast is great and studio problems that nearly cancelled the serial actually helped the realism of the tent scenes.  Another great addition to the Doctor Who collection.",1345334400,6,454,4.567901234567901
5114911,5,B007Z10I5E,"The Doctor and Ace receive a mysterious advertisement for the Psychic Circus, on the planet Segonax, and decide to check it out. Ace isn't happy about it. She is secretly afraid of clowns (it's called coulrophobia), but the Doctor insists on going.

Well, this is one circus that won't put Ace's fears to rest, that's for sure. Before the Doctor and Ace arrive on the scene, we see a clown jester in white face, with a predator's smile, tracking two circus escapees. One dies, the other, the Bellboy, is taken back to his circus cage.

When Ace and the Doctor arrive at the circus, they realize there is something very weird here. There's only three people in the audience, a father, mother and exceedingly creepy little girl. Well, all three are creepy. The Ringmaster is creepy, the clowns are creepy, especially the Chief Clown, who chased down the escapees.

This is one circus where you will just die to take part. And there's a twist.

""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" first aired December 1988-January 1989. This review is for the upcoming August 2012 DVD, which is the first time this show has been released on DVD. It will be one disc of 98 minutes.

I read that an asbestos scare at the BBC studios helped inspire an episode that could be shot outside the studios, such as in a large tent!  Otherwise, ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" may have gone the way of ""Shada"".

Doctor Who performs some magic tricks when it's his turn in the circus spotlight. Sylvester McCoy was coached by ""The Great Soprendo"", stage name of Geoffrey Durham.

This seems to be a love-it or hate-it episode. I'm in the former camp, and Ian Reddington as the menacing Chief Clown has a big part in that. And I love the scene where they approach the circus, and in the background sky is a big pinkish planet with rings around it.

Extras:
1.  Commentary With actors Sophie Aldred (Ace), Jessica Martin (Mags, one of the circus ""acts"" and a great character) and Christopher Guard (Bellboy), writer Stephen Wyatt, script editor Andrew Cartmel and composer Mark Ayres. Moderated by Toby Hadoke. At one point, Mark Ayres talks about the difficulty of filming in the outside tent: ""Every time a delivery track turned up to unload the beer for the club, we had to stop shooting for a few minutes.""
Andrew Cartmel talks about Mags' transformation (spoiler!). Dr. Who's monsters/creatures were too often cheaply done. But for Mags, he said, ""...the makeup and the costume is fantastic. Jessica does a great job with it. It's genuinely scary, it's a proper monster, and so often our monsters didn't work, and this is exactly how we should have done the Cheetah People in 'Survival'. It's the way we wanted to do them, instead of the teddy-bears they turned out. If we'd done them like this, it would have been magnificent."" [""Survival"" was the very last Classic Dr. Who episode, airing in Nov/Dec 1989.]
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) Everybody agreed that the series title was awful. It was required by John Nathan-Turner, the producer, however, and he had his reasons. Cartmel says, ""It's a dark story. But it's a glitzy title. ... It doesn't sound like a science fiction title.""
2.  ""The Show Must Go On: Making the Greatest Show in the Galaxy"", a short where members of the cast and crew look back on the making of this story. Sylvester McCoy, unfortunately, does not take part (except in outtakes), but participants include Andrew Cartmel, Sophie Aldred, Alan Wareing (director), Ian Reddington (Chief Clown) and Mike Tucker (visual effects assistant), David Laskey (designer)and John Nathan-Turner (producer) from an archive interview.  Reviews I've seen of it thought this extra was very good. Ian Reddington was badly hurt in an accident on the set, and that (unused) scene is shown and discussed.
(added after my DVD was received and watched:) There are so many things that go into making the mood for a show. A lot of them are little, and the audience probably doesn't appreciate them. (Well, we're not supposed to say, ""Boy, that music is creepy. We're just supposed to FEEL creepy.) In an example of one of the little things that makes a difference, Wareing talks about the hearse that the Chief Clown drives. ""I wanted it to have the electric windows. ... It was important for me that the window just went down to reveal the Chief Clown. I couldn't see him winding them down himself.""
Laskey talks about the hippie bus of the Psychic Circus - the original bus they used before everything went wrong. The derelict bus was buried to the wheels in the sand at the quarry. BBC didn't have the money to pull it out after shooting, so they got permission to leave it. Maybe it's still there today.
3.  Deleted and Extended Scenes
4.  ""Lost in the Darkness: The Greatest Show in the Galaxy's Missing Model Shots"". Mike Tucker explains the model effects created for the series, but ultimately not used.
5.  ""The Psychic Circus"" (2012). A music video set to a song written by Christopher Guard and featuring vocals by Christopher Guard, Jessica Martin and TP McKenna (who plays The Captain). Keyboards and programming by Mark Ayres. This is rumored to be so bad it's good.
(added after my DVD was received and watched:)  -  I LIKED it!

""D-D-D-Doctor!
...
There is no escaping us
We are the Psychic Cir-Cus""

6.  ""Remembrance"" Demo. Two scenes from the ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" series, re-scored by Mark Ayres. He was asked for these demos before he was given the contract for the music of ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"".
7.  ""Tomorrow's Times - The Seventh Doctor"". The on-going series looking at the press coverage of Doctor Who reaches the Sylvester McCoy era. Anneke Wills moderates, and, to put it mildly, the Seventh Doctor was not much appreciated by the British press.
8.  ""Victoria Wood"".  Doctor Who sketch from the TV series ""Victoria Wood - As Seen on TV"". It's a send-up and humorous.

5114912,5,B007Z10I5E,"Synopsis: The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and his companion, Ace (Sophie Aldred), discover all is definitely not what it seems when they visit the Psychic Circus on the planet Segonax. All the performers fear for their lives; their sinister audience demands constant amusement, and for whoever gives an unsatisfactory performance, it will undoubtedly be their last.

In my opinion this is one of the coolest, creepiest Dr Whos ever, and by the end, you yourself might find the circus a little... sinister.",1337558400,8,510,5.219512195121951

5114914,1,B007Z10I5E,"When watching part two of Silver Nemesis, it freezes several times to the point where it cuts back to the menu. It's because there's grease-like prints on the disk and I couldn't get them to wipe off.",1432857600,,200,4.4324324324324325
5114915,4,B007Z10I5E,"The Doctor battles in evil Circus on a strange world in a story featuring a werewolf, a pompous evil explorer, and crazy clowns.

There's so much to enjoy in this story. It has superb atmosphere, particularly during the circus scenes. It takes Ace, one of the Doctor's most courageous companions and put her in touch with something that terrifies her. In this case, evil clowns. The characters are wonderful and memorable. Given that this was almost scrapped, it's a surprising tour de force. And the scene with McCoy casually strolling away from the climatic explosion was wonderfully iconic.

If I had any complaint, it's that many of the cliffhangers in this seemed weak. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and it shows the resurgence of quality in the Classic's show's waning years.",1432512000,,800,5.007518796992481
5114916,4,B007Z10I5E,"The creepiest clown in classic Who! I really liked this villain but his masters?! Anyway, What do Flower children and circus pros and androids have in common? This very weird story but the explosion at the end was a close call for Sylvester McCoy in real life.",1429488000,,260,4.553191489361702

5114918,4,B007Z10I5E,Just watched this for the first time and I loved it. I think this might be one of my favorites from the McCoy era.. I can only give this 4 stars tho. Just felt like it was lacking something. But I'd definitely recommend this to other WHO fans who haven't seen it yet.....,1427846400,2,271,4.132075471698113

5114920,5,B007Z10I5E,In my humble opinion the best of the MCCOY years and one of the best serials in a long time. Definetly a favorite of mine. If evil clowns sound appealing this episode is awesome. It's pure late 80s fun! One episode; it had such a giant explosion it literally almost killed MCCOY himself if the actor had hesitated a step.,1423267200,,321,4.366666666666666

5114922,4,B007Z10I5E,"I got this DVD for myself on a whim, as it wasn't available on Netflix. Almost every single Doctor Who serial is available through Netflix, but there are a few, mostly the most recently released Doctor Who serials, that aren't available on Netflix yet and I decided to check out this serial without really previewing it, so to speak. It is actually an interesting story, and it does draw parallels between 'The Greatest Show in the Galaxy', the Psychic Circus, and Doctor Who, although it doesn't praise itself too highly. There is a dark undercurrent to the Psychic Circus at this point in its history, according to the players, as the idealism of its past, symbolized by 60s/70s hippie counterculture, has died out and now it is a very grim place that has betrayed the wide-eyed optimism and love of its greatest fan, feeding him to the lions, so to speak. And so Doctor Who explores the dark realm of a failing/failed circus full of monsters and betrayal, acknowledging that they haven't always been 'The Greatest Show in the Galaxy'.",1387756800,,1037,4.766666666666667
5114923,5,B007Z10I5E,"My first exposure to Sylvester McCoy was ""The Curse of Fenric"", and while far from a bad story, it still didn't quite make my favorites list. I did, however find Sylvester McCoy's Doctor to be excellently written and brilliantly portrayed. After I watched ""Remembrance of the Daleks,"" McCoy was cemented as my personal favorite Doctor. What does this have to do with ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy?"" Just that Sylvester McCoy, and the Doctor, are at their best here. It's definitely one of his darker portrayals, which I loved, particularly in his last season. What complements McCoy's acting here is the brilliant writing and Sophie Aldred's excellent performance as Ace. The Chief Clown is creepily played by Ian Reddington, and he is excellent as well. In fact, excellent pretty much sums up this entire story.

The sets are convincing, the location footage is great, and every supporting character is memorable, with the exception of Whizz Kid. There are some really interesting plot twists, like the one at the end of episode 3 and partway through episode 4. So, in conclusion, ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" is a brilliant story that all McCoy fans, and for that matter all Doctor Who fans, should check out.",1385337600,2,1219,4.91747572815534
5114924,5,B007Z10I5E,"In the Slyvester McCoy era of Doctor Who episode entitled ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" The Doctor and Ace traveling inside the TARDIS encounter a strange robot messanger that invites them to check out the Psychic Circus on the planet called Segonax. A place with acrobats, clowns and all manner of things one would find from an intergalatic circus can provide.  Meanwhile other travelers have arrived to the strange planet to which the circus has taken up residence.
  As the Doctor and Ace make there way to the circus they meet two travelrs Mags a strange young woman who seems to be afraid of something but not of this world.  Her companion the famed explorer Captain Cook have been on the planet for sometime and have discovered a strange robot at there dig. They also encounter a crazed biker called Nord and the Psychic Circus biggest fan Whizz Kid.  What the Doctor and Ace don't know is that these people have all been brought to the planet for the Circus own dark designs.  As one by one they have been captured and forced to perform onstage for a strange family of three.
  The Doctor discovers strange stones that don't seem to belong to the circus.  Ace encounters the circus janitor a man called Dumbo who keeps singing the same tune and speaks the lines over and over again. Meanwhile Captain Cook seems content to pit the others against themselves so that he does nto have to perform.  The circus is trying in vain to get more to them but its clear the Doctor is a problem and must be dealt with.  Can the Doctor figure out why the circus wants them to perform?  And who is this strange family that demands more entertainment and what do they have to do wit hthe stones around the center ring?  Will any of the live to see another day?  Tune in to check out ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" to find out.",1373587200,,1824,4.471299093655589
5114925,5,B007Z10I5E,Enjoyed and added to my collection of all the Doctor Who dvds.  Would recommend other Dr Who fans to buy.,1371945600,,105,4.25
5114926,4,B007Z10I5E,"A pretty good story of the Seventh Doctor and Ace visiting the Psychic Circus. The story features scary clowns, killer robots, and even an unexpected werewoman! There is even a rapping ringmaster! That's the nifty parts, the less than ideal part is that the outdoor scenes were mostly filmed in a quarry, but this is augmented by special effects which make it somewhat better. The final baddies were a bit out of left field for me, and I felt they didn't really fit in with the rest of the story. However, it wasn't too out of line for Doctor Who of the late '80's.

The DVD extra's feature both Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred as well many other members of the cast and production team discussing the making of the episode. This was particularly interesting, as this episode would have been lost like Shada had John Nathan Turner and other production team members gone to Herculean efforts to finish the serial. Great effort and creativity were used to film the ""studio"" portion of the adventure in the face of unexpected issues, and this is all discussed in the extras.",1370390400,4,1073,4.677248677248677
5114927,5,B007Z10I5E,"But was never that much of Sylvester McCoys Doctor. Getting these DVDs from the years that he stared as the Doctor are slowly changing my mind. As usual, production values are high for what the show was budgeted (as the McCoy years found the BBC disliking the show) and it takes some time for McCoys portrail of the Doctor to grow on you. The behind the scenes features are good to have on this DVD as it gives more insite as to what eveyone was trying to accomplish here (and in other stories).",1368403200,2,495,4.333333333333333
5114928,3,B007Z10I5E,"First off this was not the dvd I was looking for that Mr McCoy did. I didn't like the storyline in this, which doesn't happen often with my favorite Doctors. Thankfully!",1366848000,,169,4.483870967741935
5114929,5,B007Z10I5E,"I continue to collect the last two-thirds of McCoy's run, and I continue to be impressed by him & the storytelling quality.  No matter what, he is definitely my 5th favorite Doctor.  And this is another gem from the 25th season, a very special season by the looks of it.  It's a very entertaining story with some good action & memorable characters like Mags & Captain Cook, the selfish & arrogant intergalactic explorer (he reminded me of an evil version of Commander McBragg, as well a dark counterpart to the Doctor).  The villains behind it all were quite creepy.  The story was so good, it reminded me of the new series (they introduce a bunch of weird things that have you scratching your head, then they all tie together neatly & it makes sense).  This is another great story from one of the best periods of the old show.",1363219200,,827,4.516778523489933
5114930,5,B007Z10I5E,"The seventh doctor, Sylvester McCoy,  is as mysterious as ever in this episode. Lots of action and plot elements here.",1354233600,,118,4.9
5114931,5,B007Z10I5E,"I've been waiting for this episode to show for some time. I was happy to see it available from Amazon and pre-ordered it. This involves aliens and ancient gods who wish to be entertained. Failure to do so, by what they believe is entertainment results in the immediate destruction of the entertainer which is all the time. There is a lot more to the circus which gives some question as to what is entirely going on. You'll have to see for yourselves.",1347235200,,450,4.5
5114932,3,B007Z10I5E,"Overall, not a bad story. Interesting plot and twists that keep you entertained throughout. The story loses two stars, one for miserable little Ace, the classic series worst companion; and one for the rapping ringmaster who looks oddly like that skinny clown in the White House, quite nauseating.",1345334400,2,296,5.1875

8523216,4,B007Z10I5E,"Another good adventure for 7 and Ace (great companion).  A truly bizarre show which I was  bit meh on but McCoy is brilliant in the last episode.

Again, good special features.  Very interesting how this almost did not come about.",1519603200,,230,4.675
8523217,5,B007Z10I5E,Great DVD.,1501113600,,10,4.5
8523218,5,B007Z10I5E,"okay, so this story was creative, the ending surprised me, the cast and characters were excellent, I was scared, the writer did an excellent job, and its one of seven's greatest stories.",1494720000,,186,4.84375
8523219,4,B007Z10I5E,this doctor is probably the least well known. But I think he's a great incarnation and it wasn't his fault that they made him more powerful and scheming than he was earlier. This same type of storyline would appear in later doctor stories after the reboot.  With the great late 'john hurt' as the war doctor.  And of course we have the cool companion ACE.  Who was a woman who was willing to fight if needed.  She was great.  The story is ok and this one too.  But then I like all the old dw stories.,1490918400,,500,4.15625
