8265732,3,B0017GD22E,"Warning! There is one spoiler ahead.

The winter scenery in Switzerland is beautiful.

Jill Ireland is very convincing in the role of a ""dumb"" mistress. In some scenes, she shows that shes not dumb as people think. In other scenes, she makes me hate her characters silliness.

As usual, Bronsons acting is interesting.

The most irritating thing about this film is some huge illogical scenes. For example, Bronson converts some nails in to darts. Then he uses a long, thin tube to blow the darts and kill his enemies. In one scene, he stands on the ground and kills a bad guy on the first floor with this weapon! Come on, director! This is not a ninja movie, its a contemporary picture.

 In another example, the gang leader acts like a fool multiple times, especially at the end. That insults the intelligence of the viewers.

Its still worth watching once.",1448496000,,858,4.68

8265734,2,B0017GD22E,"Not much love and not many bullets in Love and Bullets, which sees Charles Bronson's cop escorting Jill Ireland's gangster's moll (""I'm the best lay- ..dee"") across Europe to testify against mob boss Rod Steiger, who's presumably wanted on charges of overacting with an unlicensed stage stutter and find themselves pursued by Paul Koslo's half-deaf hood and Henry Silva's overpriced but not terribly effective hitman and his girlfriend Lorraine Chase. Married or not, there's no chemistry between the stars and, in a part that seems to be written for Dolly Parton, Ireland shows neither range or remotest sign of acting ability, which makes the journey feel longer than it should, and there's not really enough action along the way to liven things up (and even less in the version that played UK theatres which cut out some of Bronson's improvised weaponry). Pretty much the last Charles Bronson film to have A-list production values and an A-list director - at least until John Huston left the picture and was replaced by Stuart Rosenberg - it's nothing special. Still, Anthony Richmond's cinematography of the Swiss locations is very appealing and at least the weather stayed nice for them.

The Region 4 PAL Australian DVD is cropped fullframe (only the end titles are in the original widescreen) with no extras but is uncut.",1287619200,,1328,5.036363636363636
8265735,3,B0017GD22E,"I have been waiting for a good DVD release on this movie for a long time. I spotted this Marketplace PAL release. I took a chance and purchased it and was disappointed in this Australian release. It was the same as watching a old VHS tape and NOT worth the purchase price, so, I am still waiting for a U.S. release.",1226361600,,315,4.180327868852459
