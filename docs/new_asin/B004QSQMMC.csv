Don't expect to be sounding much like Hendrix after just this one DVD but if you practice you can improve.",1435536000,,259,4.531914893617022
8438516,4,B004QSQMMC,"The one star reviewer is wrong for rating this DVD a 1 star... I checked out the video on YouTube. He does play in the style of Hendrix. He even mentions similarities to songs that Jim played. There are already enough DVDs on how to play Jimi Hendrix songs this is about technique, style, licks, and chops! I loved what I saw on YouTube and I will be buying this DVD.",1416355200,2,367,4.183098591549296
8438517,1,B004QSQMMC,"The artist in the video is a great guitarist , however he doesn't show how to play any Jimi Hendrix songs or licks at all! He shows similar stuff you can play, but nothing Jimi played! The video should be titled ""Sounds like Hendrix"". I guess he didn't want to pay the licensing fees or something to use Jimi's actual music in the video.",1360368000,3,337,4.28125
