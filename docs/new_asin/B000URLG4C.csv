8214574,5,B000URLG4C,"I really like this video.  I was looking for something that would pinpoint Abs, and this does.  It is a little slow going, but so am I, so a good fit.  I was amazed at what you can do for Abs using the stability ball.  Thanks!",1351814400,,226,3.847826086956522
8214575,5,B000URLG4C,"I really like this workout! I do more of the Ab sculpt, but liked the Yoga too-no contortions, just good stretches & more core!  The Ab Sculpt has my abs on fire in no time! I like the instructor, she gives very good instruction and is natural and real, not obnoxiously perky like some instructors. From this dvd, I have learned to focus on my abs and it makes a big difference in how I feel the exercises!  The Preachers and ab rolls are tough!  I do this workout a few times a week and love it!  I  highly recommend it!",1207526400,6,521,4.118811881188119
8214576,5,B000URLG4C,"I also bought Ball Sculpt with Kira Langolf and love this one as much as that one! There are so many great ab exercises that I was sore from this one too, for a few days. I really  need abs and this is the perfect workout for that!",1190764800,5,231,3.8125
8214577,5,B000URLG4C,"I love this dvd! There are two workouts and I can do them daily! I wasn't using my ball much b/c I had no clue what else can be done with it, besides crunches. This seemed like a good way to start. The yoga stretch is relaxing and doable! I always skipped yoga because of the funny contortions, but this is yoga even I can do!  The Ab sculpt workout has so many different variations and tips that I can do just part of it and get a good workout!  I'll be getting Ball Sculpt 1 from Kira next! Beware: This is a very addicting workout combo!",1188604800,8,540,4.037383177570093
