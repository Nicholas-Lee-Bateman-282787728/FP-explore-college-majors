8062007,5,B0009JOTW2,I was very pleased with my order.  My order exceeded my expectations.  I enjoyed watching this DVD.  It has pretty scenery and is a good worship experience.,1423872000,,156,4.703703703703703
8062008,4,B0009JOTW2,"It's a great product but...

I had previously owned several iWorship DVD's, and was purchasing for my Wednesday Evening Worship service.  When I received the DVD, I realized it did not include the Split-trak option... This threw a kink in my service plans, but we are still satisfied with the product.

Note to self: @Home DVD's are only standard tracks...",1412208000,,356,4.9
8062009,5,B0009JOTW2,Loved it! Used for a private group bible study and we cannot play it  enough. This is highly demanded over regular CD music.,1385424000,,124,4.391304347826087
8062010,4,B0009JOTW2,"I hold a small group Bible study every Sunday, 10-20 young people 16-20 yrs. old. I wanted music that would liven up our meetings a bit.  This dvd provides the video scenery, the words and music as well as a lead singer for the songs.  It was a little tricky to operate, but works well for my purpose.  The students like it and it was just the thing!  I will look for more modern music for future use, but needed one where I knew at least some of the songs.",1379289600,,457,4.044444444444444
