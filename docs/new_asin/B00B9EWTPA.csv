5564434,5,B00B9EWTPA,"My family and friends are getting so tired of hearing about Supreme 90 Day.  I am on Day 21.  I have lost 4 1/2"" on my waist, 2 1/4"" on my thighs, 2 1/2"" on my hips and 1"" in my arms - in 21 DAYS!

This really is the most amazing workout I have ever done.  I was 200 pounds.  I lost 43 pounds going to the gym.  I still needed to lose weight and tone.  I plateaued - as all of us do.  I was frustrated.  I was about to give up again.

UNTIL someone introduced me to Supreme 90 Day.  It has changed my life.  The inches are melting off!  Some people ask if the workouts are getting easier?  NO because they challenge you each time you do one.  You use higher weights, you work harder, do more reps - you work at your pace both slower and faster!

Please, don't wait another minute to get the body you want. I feel like a million bucks and so can you - for what?  $19?  Do it now!",1360022400,9,878,3.783333333333333

5564436,5,B00B9EWTPA,"My hubby and I have had great results with this so far- in two weeks, he is down nine pounds and I have lost five.  We love that these videos are only about 30 minutes, require only weights and a ball, and do not require a lot of space.  They incorporate strength training and cardio at the same time.  Search online and you will find many positive comparisons of this set with P90x, Insanity, etc.  A lot of the same moves, but your sanity remains intact.",1358640000,7,456,4.267441860465116
5564437,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I previously reviewed the Supreme 90 Day System (DVD) and this one (""as seen on TV"") has the same cover and the same 10 DVDs so I will repeat my previous review here.

First, here are the 10 DVDs, with a brief summary and their time outlines.

1. Chest & Back (32:30)
Warmup (4:19): The warmup includes ab work (the core) & is (at first) like a mini-workout. At over 4 minutes, all of the DVDs except Tabatha Inferno has this warmup.
Workout (22:14): At over 22 minutes, they move fast on this first DVD.
Cool-down (5:57): These are stretches. All of the 10 DVDs have the same cool-down.

2. Ultimate Ball (40:49)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (30:33): This uses the large Swiss ball. I just did it without the ball.
Cool-down (5:57):

3. Tabata Inferno (43:42)
Warmup: It is only on this DVD that the warmup is included in the main workout.
Workout (37:45): I hate this one. This is long and tough. This includes moderate and tough aerobics, with some weight training. The exercises include jumping variations, core work, and the circuits never seem to end.
Cool-down (5:57):

4. Shoulders & Arms (43:05)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (32:49):
Cool-down (5:57):

5. Cardio Challenge (41:22)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (31:06): This is my favorite. Moderate weights are used to boost calorie burn. In general, you alternate 30 seconds of aerobics, followed by 30 seconds of rest, followed by 30 seconds of using moderate weights in an aerobic fashion, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and then repeat the same pattern.
Cool-down (5:57):

6. Legs (33:17)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (22:51): This is not only leg work. There is ab (core) work.
Cool-down (5:57):

7. Total Body (33:33)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (23:17):
Cool-down (5:57):

8. Core Dynamics (28:22)
WarmUp (4:19):
Workout (18:06): At just over 18 minutes, this is the shortest workout.
Cool-down (5:57):

9. Back & Bi's (56:38)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (46:22): This is the longest workout, at over 46 minutes.
Cool-down (5:57):

10. Chest, Shoulders, & Tri's (45:18)
Warmup (4:19):
Workout (34:52):
Cool-down (5:57):

The main workouts (excluding the warmups and the cool-downs) vary from about 18 minutes to about 46 minutes, with many close to 30 minutes, so these are relatively short workouts.

The workouts use dumb-bells and a large Swiss ball. You need moderate to medium weight dumb-bells, but you can do the exercises without the ball. I did not use the ball, although I do have a bench.

~~~~~

This 10 DVD set provides excellent instruction on using dumb-bells in a programmed and well structured sequence. This program is fairly intense and it might take a little while to build up, especially if you are a beginner. This may be better suited for someone with exercise experience or it may considered an intermediate DVD.

All the talent, (men and women demonstrators), are extremely fit and sometimes go fast, on many of the exercises, especially push-ups. After quite a few months, I find that I can go fast on push-ups too. On the jumping (plyometrics), I walked in place (slow or fast) or stepped side to side, instead of doing the jumping. Walking is a lot easier if you have knee or feet issues.

Tom Holland is the instructor and he is pleasant, affable and knowledgeable",1350086400,42,3226,4.8791208791208796
5564438,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I have never done any real exercising aside from gym class in high school, and then two years ago I started this.  I went from a 32"" waist to a 28"", and that was about a year ago.  Now I am focusing more on the strength training dvds, and this really helped my metabolism go up so I can eat A LOT now.  I absolutely love this because it is simple and fast and really effective.  It really works, and you have so many options for exercises with 10 DVDS!!!  I LOVE this, nuff said",1389225600,2,478,3.9894736842105263
5564439,5,B00B9EWTPA,very nice exercise program for a fair price. If you do not have a huge exercise ball you can also also use a small soccer/basketball instead or simply a chair and switch to an exercise ball later once you improved.,1383609600,2,214,4.375
5564440,3,B00B9EWTPA,"I likes this product, but I chose this rating because one of the DVDs did not work. I contacted the seller and they apologized, and acted like they would replace it but I haven't heard from them again. So my suggestion is if you want to buy this, make sure all the DVDs work when you get it. If not send it back and look elsewhere. The product itself it great.",1382140800,,360,4.084507042253521
5564441,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I HATE 60 minute videos!  I get bored with them.  I love S90 and I am seeing results on Day 6.  (My second time doing it.)  Went to Insanity and not bashing it, I think it's good if you have a lot of fat to burn, but for me, I need the weights with my cardio.",1379289600,5,259,3.5714285714285716
5564442,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I have been working out for years and really like all ""The Firm Tapes"", etc.  I bought
this tape for $20 a few years ago and after the first 90 days I couldn't believe the
changes in my body.  The best part - 30 minutes a day.  No wasted time talking or standing
around.  I went through my daughter's P90X, called her up and said, ""Half the time the guy
is talking.""  The yoga DVD is 1 hour and 30 minutes.  I don't have that kind of time to work
out.  If I know it is only about 30 minutes, I do it and get it over with.  There is no wasted
time.  There is core in almost every DVD.  I've gone through the 90 day program about 5 times
now and will probably do these tapes the rest of my life.  I gave my daughter my set and am
buying another new one for myself.

If you want to change your body in 30 minutes a day, buy these work-out DVD's. Most people
ask me how I stay in such good shape and I always tell them about these work-out DVD's.  The
man that gave these DVD's a 1 star only watched one DVD and didn't like the way the girls were
smiling on the tape.  Is he kidding???  What does that have to do with anything?  I want a
good work-out in as little time as possible.  These are the DVD's that will give you the
results.",1373068800,19,1231,3.8795180722891565
5564443,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I am coming at this from the perspective of an advanced exerciser who has completed several rounds of Beachbody's P90X and Cathe Friedrich's STS Series.

Is Supreme 90 a copy cat version of P90X? It's based on the same principle of muscle confusion, as well as the principle of clean eating.  It's similar but different.  I love these workouts!  They are tough and pack a lot into 30-40 minutes.  I never thought I could get a thorough workout it less than an hour, but these workouts have convinced me that I can.

Why I love these workouts:

**They're tough. My heart rate is up there for every workout, even the core ones.

**Tom Holland is a great instructor.  I'd love to have him as my own trainer.  He's tough, yet motivating.

**Constant change keeps me interested.  Since you're doing something different every day, I don't get bored with these. This set includes cardio, core and weights.

**The focus on core work.  I know it's important to work the core, but I don't like doing so.  This series has you working your core in every workout.

**The all-inclusive nature of the program.  There's a nutrition plan, compiled by Tosca Reno, plus online web support.

**The workout crew is all very fit and very motivating.  I'd love to look half as good as the women in these DVDs.  Okay, so that's a pipe dream, but it's fun to imagine.

**The price.  I had a coupon, so the entire set cost me all of $16.00.  Most of the single DVDs in my collection cost more than that!

Some things to note about these workouts:

**The warm-up and cool-down are the same for each workout.  This can get a little tiring after a while.

**The pace is frantic.  Tom keeps telling us to go at our own pace, but it's hard to do so when the cast is going very fast.

**These aren't appropriate for beginners. Even though easier modifications are shown, because of the fast pace, you really have to focus on your form.  Tom doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  I've worked out for years one-on-one with personal trainers, so I can maintain good form.

**The DVD case is cardboard and very flimsy.

**The rotation, as designed, seems a recipe for overtraining.  There aren't enough rest days scheduled.

**The warm-ups aren't long enough for me.

I've modified the rotation as follows:

**I do 20 minutes of very easy cardio to start.

**In Weeks 4, 8 and 12, I put an extra day of yoga in between each workout, so my body has more chance to recover.

In spite of the ""things to consider,"" I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting a tough workout that works!  Even if you only do one or two DVDs from this set, it's worth the purchase.",1365897600,16,2625,4.490445859872612
5564444,1,B00B9EWTPA,"My wife and I have previously done P90X and Insanity. We like them, but just needed a change. So we bought this video set. What a mistake. We never even got through the first video. This is obviously a cheap knock off of the beach body products. On the very first video, there is a girl who looks pretty, but looks utterly depressed, she barely even looks up. Instead of motivating me, I'm feeling sorry for her,. Then the second girl who obviously bought herself a new  pair of .... turns on this fake smile that was obviously demanded from off camera.  The music sucks and is not motivating at all, and there is no option like in the beach body products to shut down the music and just get the commentary.  So I try and put the first DVD back into it's space in the packaging and I rip the cardboard that hold it in place. So now I've damaged the packaging. I doubt they would take it back. Stick to the real deal, don't go for the imitators. I can't even bare to pull out another DVD.",1365033600,2,987,4.211640211640212
5564445,5,B00B9EWTPA,"Obviously they are borrowing heavily from the ultra successful and similar p90x, but that doesn't invalidate the quality of these workouts.  I own P90X and it is a good system but they are constantly selling you on their MLM company and supplements.  It is very expensive and also the workouts are (needlessly) way too long.  There is too much standing around and talking between sets. This system is pretty much bull-free, straight forward, old school hard word.  There is no time wasted and you will get a great workout in the shortest time possible.  You only need dumbbells and a stability ball.  The trainer, Tom Holland, is great, he reminds me of a gym class teacher.  He is there to help, without a bunch of ego.  The participants are all very ripped and model great form throughout.  I highly recommend this.  The case is cheap cardboard but who cares?  It is a great set for a great price.",1364947200,15,899,4.6265822784810124

8564625,5,B00B9EWTPA,This was reviewed by Shape Magazine.  They touted it to be as good as PX 90. It is great. I am a mom to two young boys.  The workouts are hard but condensed to 30 minutes.  I really want to be back in shape and these DVDs deliver results.  I do enjoy the boot camp type workouts and I am enjoying the results.,1405123200,2,309,3.857142857142857
8564626,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I've used these videos for over three years now, and have been meaning to write a review sooner.
For the price, you can't beat this workout for getting in great shape.

First I'll get out of the way just the couple things I didn't like about the videos that some of the other reviewers covered.

The warmups and cool-downs are the same on each dvd and do get repetitive.  I've also found that if you stick to
the routine as suggested, it can be too much on the ankles and especially knees (but as my username suggests,
i'm not in my 20s anymore).  There are a lot of jump squats, lunges and such.  I substituted some of these exercises with something else to avoid overuse of a particular joint.  I also added in one extra rest day a week, or substituted one of the workouts with just a 15 minute core/ab workout.

But on the plus side, I can say that after doing these videos for three months, I was in fantastic shape.  When first starting,it was very difficult to keep up with the people working out in the videos.  After a few weeks, I could basically keep up, but not do the same number of reps or always keep pace.  Had to hit the pause button or take a little break.  But after 8 weeks,I could do almost all the exercises at the same pace.  And actually I found the cardio video became not hard enough and I would run on the treadmill a bit after the video to feel like I got a really good workout.

The tabata inferno video is fantastic, it is the best all around exercise session I've done.  I also like that they do core exercises in almost all videos, consisting of wood-chops, side planks, bicycles and other ab exercises.

The number of different weights you need is minimal, and would suggest getting an exercise ball.  Also, though you get a pretty good back workout with these videos, I would suggest getting either resistance bands or a pull-up bar if you really want to work your lats.

After doing the video for 90 days and somewhat following the meal plan, for three years in a row I consistently lost 20+ pounds and got into great shape.  For the price, if you stick to it, you can't beat it.",1403395200,3,2113,4.319796954314721
8564627,5,B00B9EWTPA,"I have done a multitude of these work-outs over the years and i can honestly say that this is my favorite by a long margin.  Listen to Tom and do the work and it will pay off.  I am down more than 40 lbs over the last 2 years and have a six pack that anyone half my age (61) would be happy to sport.  Is it easy? hell no, you are going to sweat and swear trying to keep up with the kids he has doing the work-out but the results are worth it.  No wasted time, no selling other products, no talking too much (you listening Billy Blanks) just a well rounded work-out that gets the job done.",1401667200,3,588,3.875
8564628,3,B00B9EWTPA,"I bought this because I didn't have the money to buy P90X yet, when I bought this it was only $30.  It's a good work out, well planned out and if you work hard like Tom Holland say you do see and feel results.  I like that the work outs are only about half an hour also.  The things I don't like about it are the way the sets are presented are inconsistent, one on DVD they have an official this is what you'll be doing, and on the others he just grabs one of the people to demonstrate the exercise.  The music doesn't match the work out either, so if you need music to motivate you this work out is not for you.  All in all it's a good work out.",1394582400,2,646,3.8636363636363638
