I DO PREFER THE JAMES D'ARCY VERSION.
IF A FILM IS TAKEN FROM GREAT LITERATURE AND WELL DIRECTED-FILMED-AND COSTUMED
IS NICE TO MAKE COMPARISONS AND WATCH THEM ALL",1356739200,,244,4.6976744186046515

2403865,4,B000B73HIO,"I cannot really write a whole lot about this adaptation, which I purchased from an independent seller on amazon. What I can write is this: ""If you love DICKENS' writing, you should appreciate this adaptation."" Otherwise, you will want to murder yourself after about 15 minutes.

Nicholas Nickleby is a comedy - a satire. It is not reality and was never meant to be. Dickens wrote this novel for the entertainment of his readers in serialized form. It is NOT anything like an Austen novel or a Bronte novel, especially not like Jane Eyre. Therefore, anyone who expects it to be like an Austen or Bronte work WILL be severely disappointed.

In fact, Dickens' ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is more unrealistic than Dickens' ""Oliver Twist."" Therefore, if you found the characters is Oliver Twist too over-the-top, you will almost definitely be of the same opinion with ""Nicholas Nickleby.""

This said, the adaptation does a good job conveying the novel and the major plot line. In this respect, it reminds me a lot of the 1974 adaptation of ""David Copperfield."" I am not saying that the casting is perfect, but the characters who play their roles, play their roles well. You truly learn to hate Ralph Nickleby and Wackford Squeers, while feeling sorry for Nicholas, Kate, and Smike.

In comparison with the 2001 and 2002 adaptations, I believe this BBC adaptation is far better in terms of conveying DICKENS' story.

In my opinion, the 2001 ""Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby"" starring James D'Arcy as Nicholas is also quite good for individuals who want to Bronte-ize the novel by mitigating the caricatures.  It also tells the story pretty well by keeping a large amount of the plot (by making it skeletal plot). However, I would recommend the 2001 adaptation, as well as the 1977. PS: This 2001 adaptation can be found in full on a particular video cite that begins with the letter 'y.'

However, the 2002 MGM adaptation is trash (in my opinion)because it not only is NOT Dickens, but it also does not make sense, especially Ralph Nickleby's behavior. If I want to watch a film with inconsistencies, I would rather they be Dickens rather than some scriptwriters'. Of course, I know why Ralph Nickleby (playing by Christopher Plummer) is portrayed so terribly - it is because MGM had to keep the film under 140 minutes and that requires considerable plot alterations. However, I think it would be very difficult for a scriptwriter to tie all the plots of Nicholas Nickleby together in under 3 hours, no matter how talented the writer. Dickens' novel is just too complicated.

In summary:

- I recommend the 1977 BBC adaptation for the loyalists.
- I recommend the 2001 Acorn Media release for those who want a more Bronte-like romance (i.e. eliminating the caricatures and stressing the unlikely romances).

- I do not recommend the 2002 MGM adaptation.",1262044800,16,2848,4.877846790890269
2403866,4,B000B73HIO,"I would recommend this DVD to any Dickens lover, even though some parts are not very entertaining.  I especially enjoyed watching the relationship between Nicholas Nickleby and Smike develop.  My least favorite part of the movie was the introduction of Kate, Nicholas' sister.  She seemed lost in the beginning but found in the end.  Ralph Nichleby and Skeers (or should I say ""Skeerie"") also made this movie a good one.  I can hardly see where one can go wrong selecting a BBC production.",1224806400,3,489,4.843373493975903
2403867,4,B000B73HIO,"I have viewed four versions of this Dickens classic and find the BBC set starring Havers to be the most consistantly satisfying.  The oldest version is processed from a print too damaged to produce a satisfactory result from the audio or visual standpoint.  The stage version by the Royal Shakespeare group has many wonderful things about it but I miss the visual images of the architecure and countryside which are so much a part of the author's world.  The recent version staring Dallimore is short on Dickensian humor and the heavy handed music score does too much to sink the performance.

Unlike another reviewer, I do not find Havers too old for the role of Nicholas.  He is supposed to be 19 and many 19 year olds look much older than Nigel does.  The best things about this BBC version are the wonderful views of the countryside and the look of the houses and towns.
The music is minimal but with Dicken's contant scene shifts I don't find that I miss it.  The actors are true to the reputation of British television actors.  Mostly trained on the stage, they are dependably wonderful.  One might choose other actors in other versions as being one's favorites for this or that role, but overall this seems to be the choice for a good basic rendering of this classic.",1223510400,28,1274,4.626666666666667
2403868,4,B000B73HIO,"The 1993 version of Nicholas Nickleby should not be considered.  It is not merely the snake-faced appearance of the actor who plays the lead, nor the fact that he speaks as though he has a bad cold with a stuffed-up nose.  But he is also a contemporary character, not a nineteenth-century character.  And that's just for starters.

The 2002 version is not bad.  With widescreen and surround sound and good photography, this is a good production for what appears to be a limited budget.  Problems begin with the casting.  The American actor who plays the lead speaks in a carefully articulated generic English accent, but that won't do, nor the fact that his manner and mannerisms are those of a contemporary rather than a period character.  Christopher Plummer is an accomplished actor, but his effort here seems half-hearted, as though he didn't think much of this production.  The actor who plays Smike mumbles his lines as though he is bucking for the role of Hamlet.  The story is powerful enough that this movie is not a washout, but none of it is particularly well done.

What the above versions lack is comedy.  Dickens was fond of mixing hilarious comedy with the most heart-rending drama, and Nicholas Nickleby is no exception.  The above versions are merely drama.  But the biggest crime is in the character of Mrs. Nickleby.  Mrs. Nickleby is one of the great comic characters of world literature.  Unfortunately, she is also politically incorrect.  The above versions simply throw out her character and replace it with a blah nonentity.

The 1977 version.  At over 5 hours, this version brings in more of the minor characters of this long story and treats the story according to the book.  As often with the BBC, there is lavish attention to sets and their accuracy and little attention to anything else.  The music is nonexistent.  The photography is not bad indoors but the few outdoor scenes are overexposed.  And the acting is marginal at best.  Nigel Havers is much too old for the role of Nicholas but does an adequate job.  The ending is satisfying.  All in all, well worth seeing, especially for readers of the book.  The emphasis is on drama.  There is humor in the character of Mrs. Nickleby and an attempt at humor in a couple of the minor characters.

The 1947 version was made before the Dhimmist ideology came to dominate movie-making, and here we find Mrs. Nickleby in all her mind-boggling glory.  In fact, all of the characters in this movie have that Dickensian edge that makes them larger, or at least more effective, than life.  Good scripting and good direction make for a hard-hitting, heart-touching and occasionally side-splitting experience.  The actors and actresses don't TRY to speak in an upper-middle-class British accent; they simply speak and behave as they normally would and it is true to the period.  The pace is fast, and the script had to streamline some of the events, but all of the major events are here and are effectively presented.  The ending is far more dramatic than in the other versions.",1200441600,21,3047,4.818532818532819

2403870,2,B000B73HIO,"This BBC production definately shows its age especially in the acting department. Nigel Havers, who plays the lead, manages to appear sincere even though there doesn't seem to be a lot of depth to his characterisation. But it is actress Kate Nichols, as his sister kate Nickleby, that is particularly painful to watch...her acting range appears to be limited to looking started,puzzled and vaguely troubled...with a few prolonged crying fits thrown in.
