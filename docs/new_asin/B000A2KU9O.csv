8072522,5,B000A2KU9O,"The Perfumed Nightmare is really a bricolage of film and narration whose form is as much if not more essential to its premise than any pretensions to a highly allegorical plotline, although that is certainly here as well.  This ""movie"" self-references the medium of film and the conventions of the cinematic art, in a very personal, inevitably human, and occasionally poignant story about a young Phillipino man's naive embrace of, and later disillusionment with, American cultural imperialism.  This movie's production is analogous to the Jeepney the protagonist drives in his village outside of Manila.

The story he tells about the confluence of identity, aspirations, culture, and globalization is universal.

The approach taken with The Perfumed Nightmare may seem somewhat dated today, but its accessible, yet sensitive tone and compassionate handling of the material (for whatever reason I'll resist analyzing) make this film oddly charming and definitely unforgettable.",1155686400,4,977,5.625850340136054
