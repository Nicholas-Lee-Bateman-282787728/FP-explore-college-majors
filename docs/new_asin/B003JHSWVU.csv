8465785,5,B003JHSWVU,"""The Seashell and the Clergyman"" is the cinematic masterpiece of Germaine Dulac, mother of the first French Avant-Gard. Dulac is also believed to be one of the very first feminist filmmakers and this work is considered by many to be the very first Surrealistic film ever made (coming out one year before ""un chien andalou""). Many have tried to interpret this film from various perspectives but it has remained an enigma. Dulac called her work ""integral cinema"" and amazingly the constructs of this film hauntingly reflect patterns of what is now called Integral Theory. Looking back on this film through the lens of Integral Theory, everything makes sense and we see that this work and Dulac were just many years ahead of their time.",1302048000,,733,4.919354838709677
