8047801,4,B0007KR1DW,"This fifteenth volume completes the first season of ""Lost in Space"" for the ""'Lost in Space Collector's Edition.'""  The penultimate episode is pretty standard as once again Dr. Smith manages to get into trouble, but the season finale is one of the better first season episodes.  Still, between the two you can see why a science fiction show that sometimes focused on action at other times turned into a children's show:

Episode 28, ""A Change of Space"" (Written by Peter Packer, First aired April 20, 1966) begins with the Intergalactic Delivery Service arriving on Priplanus.  Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) immediately wants to get his hands on a space ship to get back to Earth, but what does he have to trade?  So when the alien (Frank Graham) leaves a ship unattended Smith gets Will (Billy Mumy) to take it on a test drive into the sixth dimension the young Robinson comes back smarter than when he left.  Smith could certainly use a boost in intelligence so he tries the ship himself.  However, when he comes back he is older and not wiser, and then, to make things interesting, the alien takes the spaceship and disappears.  You know, if it were not for the fact that Will has been affected too I can see the Robinsons taking advantage of the situation to get rid of Smith.

Episode 29, ""Follow the Leader"" (Written by Barney Slater, First aired April 27, 1966) provides a pretty good ending for the first season of ""Lost in Space.""  When he is knocked unconscious in a cave, Professor Robinson (Guy Williams) is possessed by an alien spirit (voiced by Gregory Morton), who forces the space family Robinson to get ready for the Jupiter II to return to his home world.  The good news is that the Robinsons will finally get off of Priplanus, but the bad news is the alien might kill Will to keep his secret from the rest of the family.  With the rest of the family locked in the cave, it is up to Will to keep his possessed father from throwing him off a cliff.  The way this one plays out will strike many of you as being done before (and certainly since),

The last two seasons of ""Lost in Space"" were in color, so this was the last black & white episode.  Being in color was kewl (I remember having my ""Lost in Space"" Viewmaster slides) but unfortunately the show was on opposite ""Batman"" and the producers turned what was a pretty good dramatic science fiction series in terms of the first five episodes as the Robinsons got lost and crash landed on Priplanus, into a situation comedy that would be able to better compete against the campy sit com.  That was when the show devolved to the point that it was basically Dr. Smith, Will and the Robot as a comedy team each week.  Still, ""Follow the Leader"" showed the series could hang with ""Star Trek"" (which certainly did several similar episodes).",1113609600,,2803,4.562874251497006
