7765492,5,B01GQS6STG,"We had been watching the current episodes given many of the other shows have gone on hiatus.  We figured with the re-runs on another channel, it would take light years, assuming they ran the full historical 10 years in sequence.  So, we bought the first 10 years and began to watch.  WOW -- this show is downright funny.  There are many things said we have no clue what they are talking about (you know, the high level scientific stuff) -- but the rebuttal comments and the facial expressions are awesome.",1513123200,2,505,4.5777777777777775

8763343,1,B01GQS6STG,"Beware of ""Amazon's Choice""... it's a bad one. Very poor quality - several bad discs (freezing, skipping, restarting, ""Can't read - disc is dirty"" errors, etc.). These are supposedly brand new, unopened discs so shouldn't be having these issues. Thought there might be an issue with our player so we checked several other DVDs (not from this set). They all worked perfectly. I do not recommend this set.",1527292800,,403,4.9411764705882355

8763349,2,B01GQS6STG,"I gifted the series to my parents for Christmas. They are having the hardest time with a lot of their discs. It skips or it won't play at all. It looks like they are brand new discs and I don't understand why it's doing that.
If you buy it - please be cautious!",1516838400,3,261,3.943396226415094
