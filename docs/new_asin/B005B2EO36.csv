beautiful!  Then, it takes you to Venice to ride the gondolas.  That's right - you actually feel like you are touring Venice in person.
Besides the lovely scenes, the background music is soothing and beautiful.  Anna.",1420070400,,357,4.619047619047619

8463852,5,B005B2EO36,"Steve, what planet are you from???  This DVD is beyond amazing and fantastic.... I have always wanted to travel to Italy and never able to. . . but after watching this video, I feel like I have vacationed there, without having to leave my home.  I have often wondered what it would be like to travel through the canals in a gondola and now I know - just amazing!  The music is stellar Italian, and scenery and images beyond comprehension . . . I had no idea how beautiful Italy is until this Blu-Ray DVD - very moving and stunning . . . My work is very stressful, but I put this DVD on, and I feel like I am on vacation - it relaxes me totally and I feel transported. . .  Sooooooo enjoyable and absolutely fantastic!!! I LOVE IT!",1334448000,3,730,4.156028368794326
8463853,2,B005B2EO36,"It's well below average, I could go to Italy with an HD recorder and do better my self.  Most of the shots are a video camera on a tripod in a fixed position, no panning, no zooming in or out  and several of the shots are still photos.  It's actually somewhat comical seeing a picture of water with NO motion yet hearing a water sound effect in the background.  This video has encouraged me into thinking someone might pay money for my home videos, they are much better done.  Do yourself a favor....Buy a PBS production from Rick Steves or Rudy Maxa",1318204800,7,550,4.352941176470588
8463854,5,B005B2EO36,"I agree completely with the other reviewer. I love the music on this one-so italian-remember the italian
street song. A great plus is it keeps playing over and over
until you stop it. The Photographer on this one really g ot
some beautiful scenes.",1313193600,2,247,4.636363636363637
8463855,5,B005B2EO36,"I thought this video was the perfect way to enjoy this amazing part of the world.  The music fits the scenery perfectly, and there is no narration like your typical travel video.  I found it to be a very soothing experience to just watch the different scenes, listen to the music, and relax.  The scenes of Venice and the lake region were my favorite.",1311724800,,351,4.453125
8463856,5,B005B2EO36,"My favorite serenity moments video!  I am retired and don't care to watch a lot of the things they show on TV.  This video brings back so many wonderful memories of a vacation I took to Italy long ago, and the music is wonderful.  I sometimes just let it play and repeat while I'm doing chores around the house---so peaceful and relaxing.  Compliments to the photographer and the musicians!",1310774400,2,390,4.608695652173913
