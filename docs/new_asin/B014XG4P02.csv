7425291,2,B014XG4P02,"I had high hopes for this as Quadropenia is my favorite Who album and I also thought it lent itself well to an orchestral setting.  The orchestra and the arrangement were great.  Unfortunately, the performance is ruined by Alfie Boe's singing.  Roe is certainly a talented singer but his singing style is a complete mismatch for the Who's music.  If this were a ""real"" opera, Boe's singing would be fine but his voice is not suited to rock music.  If you're not sure if you will like this, I'd suggest listening to the mp3 sample from the companion music CD.  Try listening to ""The Real Me"" and that will give you an idea what you are in for and whether or not you will like this DVD.  I wish I had done that first.  It's worth two stars for the instrumental performances and the non-Boe songs.",1453161600,3,794,4.390410958904109
7425292,5,B014XG4P02,"Agree with the other reviews.  Nicely filmed and edited.  We had the pleasure of being there in person and the magic of the evening is nicely captured in this DVD.  We were finally able to put together another trip yo London that coincided with a great concert at Royal Albert Hall.  This is a great place to experience a live event, very historic and well sized compared to many concert venues that are five times the capacity.  Acoustics are really excellent live and captured very well on the DVD.  The DVD only shows one of two encore songs as I think Pete and the rest were really surprised with the positive response and the lengthy standing ovations and had not really planned an encore (as this was Quadrophenia it wasn't like they were going to throw in an encore of some other great Who music).  The second encore was rather interesting as they came back out, this time with Billy Idol with his shirt off, probably already thinking the night was over and getting changed!  In any event, any long term Who fan and Quadrophia fan should enjoy this interpretation.  The rest of the audience sitting around us (all mostly on our 50's or 60's) thoroughly enjoyed it and fully expected this was not going to be ""The Who.""  Alphie has a great voice and provides for a powerful alternative to the vocals.",1451433600,,1306,4.5665236051502145
7425293,5,B014XG4P02,"I'm not going to review the concert except to say that it was fantastic.  If you are an Alfie Boe fan as I am, it's a must-have.  He was brilliant in the Jimmy role from Quadrophenia.  Alfie is basically the whole show with just a handful of breaks.  He rocked it and had a great time.

When I review DVDs of any kind, I want to just focus on the DVD.  The concert photography was great, though I wish the camera had stuck to Alfie a bit more.  The sound was not presented as well as it could have been.  Pete Townshend, for example, is not always as audible as he should have been.

The DVD case has a great photograph of Alfie and Pete.  There are no extras of note.",1449964800,2,668,4.030534351145038
7425294,5,B014XG4P02,"A modern version of Classic Quadrophenia by Pete Townshend sung by the Who.
Alfie Boe and Billy Idol are a major powerhouse in this rock opera. Boe's tenor voice is booming and powerful and his performances in ""Bellboy"" & ""Doctor Jimmy"" make this a must see rock opera. I just watched it on PBS and it's an impressive rock opera albeit the version i watched is censored due to it airing on PBS.

I highly recommend it, if you love The Who you must give this reversion a watch. Alfie Boe gives an amazing performance.",1448755200,,516,4.431578947368421
7425295,5,B014XG4P02,"Of course we all know The Who. Of course we all know Quadrophenia. Of course we have all entered the Albert Hall, be it only for the Promenade Concerts. But here we have something else, something we cannot expect because it is new, will I say. The rock opera created a lot of many years ago has been arranged, and even more than arranged, reconstructed for the full Royal philharmonic orchestra. I must say I do not know many cases of a consecrated classical orchestra recording a rock opera. Pierre Boulez had a go at it quite a few decades ago. But here we are seeing the revival of a rock classic with the original artists, at least some of them, in such a new production that it sounds transmuted. And transmuted it is.

The music is no longer an accompaniment. It is a forest of sounds, rhythms and tempos that have their own logic in a Music Hall that is so prestigious we seem to have flown, fled or taken refuge onto another planet, as if the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Head of the Church of England, Elizabeth herself, were coming to a smallest village imaginable for the christening of the new born child of the local street sweeper or constabkle. It makes us humble, humble the way we have probably never felt.

In that forest, rainforest actually, jungle of music we then have the singers, the songs, the lyrics, the harmony, the fight to render trans-human and supernatural what is so well known we don't have to listen to the words, they come naturally in our minds, and yet we do not really have what we experienced some forty of fifty years ago, I don't want to remember, because they, the lyrics and the artists, have aged for one and because they have also followed the world. The Mod and the Rockers are long gone and today we have all other sorts of antagonisms and dualities, and even more variety still with triple and quadruple conflicts, rivalries and tragedies. We are no longer dealing with the Montagues and the Capulets. We are dealing with what is in each one of us, in all of us, the desire to kill, the desire to live, the desire to love, the desire to create, the four of them wrapped up in only one impulse, the impulse to communicate, to speak, to sing, to tell other people how happy we can be when we just get from them what we are expecting them to give us. We want to be loved to justify our love and to give that love without counting. And yet, nothing is that simple, as the bus driver would tell us.

So we try not to forget they are telling us about the world that is so torn apart that there are more cracks in the building than any building could actually bear before collapsing, ,and yet our will to survive, to outlive death makes the building stand and resist collapse. Our society should have been engulfed in all the violence it produces, and yet vital forces are so strongly stampeding down the empty street that we are still standing, breathing, living, loving, my friends, loving so hard and hugging so much that the whole world seems to be a youth liquor in our cups in spite of the bad smell of rotting flesh. Queer you will say, in the old meaning of the word, which was not that gay since it could mean some severe corporal punishment not so long ago.

But things have changed, haven't they. We don't have to yield to older brothers. We don't have to surrender to bullies. We have the power of vanquishing our shyness and swallow our modesty and stand up and say: What then if I am! and that is not a question. And we find out we can be many taking that stance which is not in our heads but in our muscles, our blood, our guts. In our souls, minds, spirits and brains.

So enjoy this simple village christening turned into a salvaging ritual to redeem the world before Doomsday and we may think Doomsday is not far away when we see the apocalyptic killings some human situations can create.

Just believe in the future and it might become what you believe in. Thats what I would tell a friend of mine, a dear friend, even the dearest friend I can imagine. Why? Why should you care whet people may say if you have the courage to do what you want to do and be what you wish to become?

7425296,5,B014XG4P02,"Pre-Ordered this and it just arrived this morning. I popped it in my DVD player and cranked it up and damn...It was every bit as good as I expected. Sound wasn't ""perfect"" but still, very good. Alfie Boe is as incredible on stage as he was on the studio version of the Classic Quadrophenia CD. This guy can downright sing! Townshend was great in his limited roll. Billy Idol was fine, etc. The Orchestra was what you'd expect...total pros! It's just a great performance. No complaints here. Buy it, enjoy it!",1447632000,5,508,4.593406593406593

I had to buy this DVD, so that I could experience the entire concert.  It was so great.  Love it.

Brings back alot of feelings and memories of my youth when I was a teen.  The stupid stuff I endured with my peers, parents, and the world.",1457049600,,341,4.090909090909091
