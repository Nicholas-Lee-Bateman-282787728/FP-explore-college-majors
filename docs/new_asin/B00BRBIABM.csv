5668373,5,B00BRBIABM,"Eagles are beautiful birds and I'm glad we are getting a blu-ray documentary about them. They have been the bird representing America for over a million years and it took just as long to finally give them the respect and honor they deserve. Sure, some of them are bald, but so are most dads and there are plenty of documentaries about dads. Dads can't fly either, but eagles can. Unless you count flying in an airplane or flying when they jump out of an airplane or helicopter, but that's not even on the same level as the flying that eagles can do.

I am looking forward to this documentary very much and even pre-ordered the expensive version.",1363219200,7,645,4.512820512820513
5668374,1,B00BRBIABM,"Really?

This is a silly price.  I can't think this is deserving of this price tag, beings as though the blu ray version (Non special edition) is under $30.

I read the list of stuff included, and I don't see anything that would cost someone $230 more dollars.

Put this in a realistic price range.. at this price tag I would expect some Eagle concert tickets.",1363219200,18,360,4.409090909090909

5668400,4,B00BRBIABM,"Very informative to a long time fan. I've only seen the first disc. I try and look past their far left political views but it appears clear that's why Felder was fired the first time. Frey wanted to fist fight him backstage for not supporting Alan Cranston's Democratic campaign. What I don't remember them saying is that Frey actually did fight Randy Meisner backstage. Meisner confirmed this. All they said in the movie was that Frey was upset with Meisner for not wanting to sing Take It to the Limit every night. Meisner said it was that the high notes at the end were too difficult. I assume this is what the fight was over. Randy said he quit after the fight. It seems like Glenn had a temper. Actually, the way Meisner, Felder and Leadon left the band wasn't too cool in my opinion. However, Glenn and Don got the Rock and Roll capable band they always wanted in the end. Looking forward to disc 2.
UPDATE: I have now seen disc 2. My view of Glenn didn't change. The issue of Felder wasn't cleared up. I feel that all the original Eagles members who had equal rights to the band's income were replaced. In the end it was just Don, Glenn and their hired hands. That's too bad.",1505692800,3,1182,4.377272727272727

5668429,5,B00BRBIABM,"Watched twice this DVD set with a friend who is a dedicated Eagles fan. Very interesting and enjoyable to watch. And I'm not even an Eagles fan. The first part is the history of the individual band members, how they got together and how they progressed till the breakup in 1980. The second part shows what they did after 1980 and how they got back together in 1994 and beyond. Internal frictions, band members turn over and who is what in this band.",1496102400,2,449,4.421686746987952
5668430,5,B00BRBIABM,"Really a great documentary, and I am sparing with 5 star reviews . If you vividly remember those days, and the Eagles' songs are part of the soundtrack of your life, this is a must. So much rich detail here, never slow.  How they got together, and the contributions of  different members, with a myriad of talents, personalities and various predilections. Some came and went, leaving their indelible mark. All of it is here. There are many details I did not know, even though I have read the various biographies. The story of Joe Walsh attaining sobriety was touching, how the members supported him and encouraged him. You can be sure he would be dead or a ""wet brain"" by now if he hadn't quit.
I am glad I bought the video, as it is well worth watching again. Great footage, old and relatively new.
So many great memories, simply thank you. RIP Glenn.",1495929600,,852,4.525974025974026

5668478,5,B00BRBIABM,"The Eagles remain one of my absolute, all time favorite band of  the 60s and 70s.  They defined Americana's Rock and Roll with so many classic hits, anyone could relate to an Eagles song.  I saw the documentary after I saw the Eagles together in concert the summer before.  They were happy to be together again and their vocals and acoustics were better then ever.  Some musicians just get better with age and this band exemplifies that.  Each member of the band, compliments the other.  The tape chronicles their journey through the highs and lows of fame, but through it all they remained a constant in the world of rock and roll.  Glenn Frey does the majority of the narration during the filming and now ironically you can't get enough footage of the late Glenn Frey.  In fact the group was thinking about another show when I understand Glenn took ill.  When I went to their concert months before I was amazed at the wit, humor and incredible talent I was privy to hear, not realizing Glenn was in constant pain from arthritis or stomach issues.  He was a brave man, who sought comfort in his family, bandmates and fans.  I'm grateful for what the many songs and memories the Eagles have given us!  Thank you",1477526400,,1211,4.550925925925926

5668510,4,B00BRBIABM,"I really like the Eagles. I also enjoyed Felder's book.

The doc was superbly done in all respects and captivating for the 4 hours. It didn't feel at all like it was getting old.

The thing that struck me, though, was how Fry and Henley  would rail on about corporations trying to take more than their fair share (as decided by H&F), and then if anyone in the band asked for more money, it was ""goodbye""

The whole thing about Walden was similar too. These are guys that have made piles of money flying all over the earth playing music. And at each city they go to, they require the attendees to drive to come and see them. This is about the most environmentally unfriendly event you can imagine. And then towards the end, Henley learns some of Walden is going to be purchased by a corporation for development and he suddenly decides that's a bad thing and they must be stopped. OK, fair enough, but you made piles of money relying on fossil fuels to power YOUR corporation. It's a bit hypocritical to suddenly get all weepy about development after you have consumed zillions of gallons of gasoline making your money with YOUR corporation.

I will give H&F credit for remaining so potent after the eagles. Henley especially. ""Boys of Summer"" is one of the best songs ever written IMO. Maybe it was just that time of my life. But that song is up there with ""Against the wind/Night Moves/etc"" and ""The River/Bobby Jean"". Smuggler's Blues, however....not so much.",1469923200,,1460,4.6

5668524,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is the definitive DVD to acquire if you're any type of Eagles fan!  The personal stories and anecdotal tidbits, show a side of a group who have (and still are!) been regarded as one of the GREATEST BANDS OF ALL TIME!!!  And with the passing earlier this year of Glenn Frey, this dvd becomes even more poignant. I've been lucky enough to have seen the Eagles perform live at different points along their history, and have seen each different lineup numerous times. Even with the different egos & talents commingling, not once, did the musical experience ever suffer. Only once, in Albuquerque in early 1980, (during the ""Long Run"" tour) could any semblance of discord be noticed within the band. But the performance that night was still flawless, and only someone who was watching closely as I was, (Full Disclosure: I was doing concert reports for various entities at the time.) would have been able to understand the little nuances occurring between the band mates.
Watch this several times and you will see different things Everytime! But do watch it because this is a dvd that tells a gripping, historical story of maybe the GREATEST BAND to emerge from the early 70's California music scene!

While I probably know all or most of the Eagles songs and certainly like them I've never been a die hard fan.  But their story really does relate a worthy chunk of 70s rock n roll music history.  The story and the talk is all fascinating and the backdrop of the 70s and learning about the band members, how and when Joe Walsh got involved and how Henley and Frey put the band together is a great story.  Don't miss it if you care anything about 70s rock history.  The tunes all take on new life with the backdrop of the band members telling their story in the process.",1465257600,,668,4.26984126984127

5668529,5,B00BRBIABM,"You don't really have to be an Eagles fan to dig this documentary, though it would help to at least be a fan of the country-rock/stadium rock genres.  I say this because there's a lot of music in this doc, though the only full songs are at the end in the 'bonus' concert that's really well done.  It's a long look (3 hours for the doc part, not counting the concert) at a band, with their formation, struggles, triumphs, and issues all covered.  It's the work of skilled filmmakers (including Alex Gibney, one of the premier documentarians currently working), and that shows.

What the film also shows is a lot of Glenn Frey and Don Henley, and while they claim that they executed no creative control or veto power ahead of time, this being an authorized and fully cooperated with documentary....well c'mon.  My quibble is that you barely heard from the bass players, Randy Meisner (on screen for perhaps 90 seconds of interviews) and Timothy B. Schmitt (around the same), and not a ton more of Bernie Leadon (Joe Walsh is on for just the right amount).  Don Felder was commented on, though given the lawsuits and bitterness, I frankly wanted more.  Frey gets his shots in, with happy relish, but it's not covered that much.  Of course by now those comments, and Frey (an engaging, frank guy) himself are tinged with sadness given his passing.  Mind you, my mild complaints, if addressed, would make a long documentary even longer, so I have a hard time begrudging them anything really.

If you're an Eagles fan this is required viewing, even if, like me, you've read the To The Limit book (a book that Henley is wildly NOT fond of) and know a lot of the pre-Felder firing background.

They were cultural icons who influenced and defined the music of the 70's. They defined who I was in the 70's, and, when listening to their music can remember where I was, and, what I was thinking about back then, soulfully.  I do not know of any other group who influenced the 70's music as they were able because of their amazingly, phenomenol music identity that has influenced a culture.  Hoo Ya!

5668654,5,B00BRBIABM,"The documentary is a fascinating look at one of the best rock bands in history.  The Eagles were never flashy or had the biggest stage show but the bands songwriting and musicianship was outstanding.  I was hooked on every minute of this film and could not turn away.  The film gives clips of the bands best songs live in between interviews from the band members directly old members and current.  The film starts when the band is at the height of their fame live at one of their concerts. Then transitions to the origins of the band with Glenn Fry growing up in Detroit, and Don Henley growing up in a small Texas Town eventually coming together in Los Angeles.  It goes through the bands first couple of albums before finding major mainstream radio success.

I always wondered why the band had line up changes within the band.  I was born in 1980 when the band broke up and was one of the millions who grew up listening to the bands tunes on classic rock radio.  My old Eagles Greatest Hits cassette tape eventually wore out from heavy use.

I had no idea Linda Ronstadt was such a big part of the bands early history.  She showed a lot of class letting the band breakoff and form their own group.  I think a lot of people would have told the guys to go to hell, but she seemed like a really good person.  Same can be said with Jackson Browne I had no clue he was good friends with the band.  I knew Jackson came up with the song ""Take It Easy"" but did not know that Glenn Frey helped him finish the song.

I came across this documentary on Netflix and it is definitely worth your time if you are an Eagles fan or just a general fan of 1970's hard rock.  I thought it was Glenn and Don Henley who were the ones who had a falling out and broke the band apart.  The documentary explains how Bernie Leadon was disappointed that the band was leaning to more towards a rock sound rather than his preferred country sound.  The band seemed not to care about his opinions and this frustration led to him leaving the band.  Randy Meisner on the other hand was just burnt out from touring and partying and did not want to play ""Take It To the Limit"" anymore.  Glenn tried to explain to him that he was sick of singing some of the same songs as well but it was a band staple song and that is what the fans wanted to hear.  When he refused to play the tune it kind of sowed the seeds to his departure.  The documentary also kind of sets things straight that it was Glenn and Don Felder who could not get along.

The band seemed to be just burnt out after the Hotel California Tour ended.  They probably needed a long break from the road and each other.  Nobody was expecting a 14 year break.  In the documentary you can tell the band was definitely tense and dysfunctional during the making of The Long Run album. I knew that Joe Walsh had a drug problem but he really did look horrible in the latter parts of this documentary during the Eagles breakup years.  It was nice to see him triumph over his demons and succeed.  I thought Joe taking hotel destruction lessons from Keith Moon was hilarious.  Like Jon Bonham and Keith Moon Joe was probably just trying to overcome some feelings of insecurity

The band manager Irving Azoff was such a small guy but you can tell he would go to war for the band to make sure they were getting paid fairly.  That is what a manager is supposed to do represent the band and stickup for them at all times.  It really makes you respect and admire him suing David Geffen to make sure the band got their royalties.  It reminded me of The Who band, where if they didn't get paid they don't play period.  Or Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant, dictating terms of where and when the band will play and for how much.  I doubt it is a coincidence that all 3 bands found major success and had great managers guiding them.

The 2nd part of the documentary focuses on each band members time during the breakup years and the massively successful When Hell Freezes Over reunion tour.  Overall I would rate this documentary 5 stars.  It does not go into depth on all the bands partying or family life but it gives you the general idea.  Those looking for a full on Eagles concert with full songs should skip this and look elsewhere.",1455667200,,4244,4.305170239596469
5668655,5,B00BRBIABM,What else needs to be said?  If you're a fan buy it! The bonus concert from the Cap Center in the late 70s was fantastic extra.,1455667200,,127,3.8846153846153846
5668656,4,B00BRBIABM,"This documentary is most interesting when covering the early days of the band before success and in the personal renaissance of Joe Walsh. It does a good job of getting input from all the members, past and present, and surprisingly gives plenty of screen time to Don Felder. Even so, Don Henley and Glenn Frey are the only two whose lives are traced back to childhood and they don't miss their chance to reemphasize how they were the heart of the band. To listen to them, they were a regular Lennon-McCartney, but the facts do not bear out this suggestion. Out of the Eagles' 17 U.S. Billboard Top 40 hits, only 4 were written by Henley-Frey without outside help (one of these was ""Get Over It,"" which inched up to #31 as the lead single after the much-hyped 1994 reunion). Along with stellar playing, Felder, Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, Walsh, and Timothy B. Schmidt ALL contributed to the writing of at least 1 of the band's Top 40 hits, and many non-Eagles (notably Jack Tempchin and J.D. Souther, along with more famous kinsmen such as Jackson Browne and Bob Seger) were also responsible at one time or another. It is also amusing to hear the rationale Henley and Frey give for the great musicians they left along the way. They squeeze out Leadon ostensibly because he is too country and they want to take the band in a more rock direction but later cut ties with the great rock guitarist Felder and end up singing country themselves. Meisner is criticized for partying too hard, and yet legendary partier Walsh is still with the band. This film contains pointless nudity better suited to a documentary about the overgrown pubic hair of the 1970s, which along with many Eagles vulgarities and on-screen drug use earns the MA rating. If you're a fan who already knows the sordid truth of the band but still enjoys Eagles music, this film will be an enjoyable retrospective. If you are a casual fan, play their music and skip this documentary.",1455580800,,1947,4.662790697674419

5668660,5,B00BRBIABM,"Amazing DVD!! Growing up in the 60's and 70's in L.A. I feel a connection to that whole 70's Southern California sound. I was there. I think I was 19 the first time I went to the Roxy Theater to see Tommy Bolin in 1975. My first exposure to the L.A. club scene. Saw a lot of great bands at the Roxy, but after watching this DVD, I guess I should have been going to the Troubadour as well. Seems it was the birth place of a lot of great artists back then.
I've only watched the first disc so far, but the early footage of this band is incredible. I regret never seeing the original Eagles band.  The Randy Meisner / Bernie Leadon incarnation created the majority of the Eagles catalog. I caught the Long Run tour in 1980, and thankfully, last year for their History of the Eagles Tour with Bernie Leadon as a guest player. R.I.P. Glenn.

A cautionary tale for other bands - yes, it is possible to play well without chemical dependencies of any sort. And oh, those soaring harmonies. Good to see that in the end, mature men set aside their young-men differences and got back to - as Don Henley summed it up - ""the music.""

5668677,3,B00BRBIABM,"I fell asleep during this documentary at least three times but that is partly a reflection of how I have always felt about their music.  I was 18 when The Eagles made their first album and in New York and Boston, where I lived, they really weren't considered a great or influential band.  The one thing that hit me during this documentary was how beautiful their voices were together.  The documentary is the usual ""band hits it big, becomes dysfunctional and plays 'poor me'"".  Slightly behind the gloss was a portrayal of some not very nice people who dropped their co-workers and support team left and right.",1453161600,2,611,4.682242990654205

5668687,5,B00BRBIABM,"I was probably like most people-I knew all of the songs but little or nothing about the individual members.  It took the entire DVD before I could put together the younger faces with the older versions.
After seeing this I read the Felder memoir and that really puts the whole thing in perspective.  If the origins of the band is tied up with the relationship between Frey and Hendley then the conflicts are intimately connected to Felder.
In the end, even though I found Frey to be intolerably obnoxious and Hendley to be annoyingly pretentious I still couldn't completely sympathize with Felder's position. He wasn't with the group from the beginning, didn't sing, didn't write that much of the music and wrote none of the lyrics.  It's obvious that they are central to the band but he isn't.
His complaints center on an earlier band commitment to split everything equally but he spectacularly misses out on the real point- they have the power to throw him out.  He is under the mistaken impression that being 'right' trumps being the one with power. Instead of getting 1/7 of millions he gets 7/7 of nothing.  That would be fine if that's what he really wanted but it wasn't.
Beyond that it was a pleasure to see how Hendley emerged as the overwhelming talent in the band- both in the songwriting and, especially, the singing. Ultimately I believe that it's his singing that really separates the band from others, along with the harmonies, which, in my estimation, are rivalled only by the Everly Brothers and the Beatles.",1448582400,2,1525,4.761363636363637

Whereas this, the first time you watch this its great, excellent, but to put it in again, na. Who wants to watch interviews or band commentary over and over again. Some of the music ""clips"" were amazing! TV performances of ""Peaceful easy feeling"" ""Lyin eyes"" and more, only to cut away after they sing one verse...sad!

5668735,5,B00BRBIABM,"Prepare yourself for this documentary, 3 hours and 3 minutes, because once you get started you may not want to stop the viewing until the final minute. The history of The Eagles, as told by the men themselves, and some interviews with Bob Seger, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and the Manager of the Eagles. It is engrossing and informative, filled with music and song, and inside information. The nitty gritty of the women, wine and song are left out. After all, when this documentary was made, these men were married with families.

The documentary, directed by Alison Ellwood, begins with Info about Glenn Frey and Don Henley's earliest forays into music with different groups. They met up and started working with Linda Ronstadt. After a few months they realized they worked well together and wanted to start their own band. Glen had learned a little about songwriting from observing Jackson Browne. Irving Azoff became their manager, and has a lot of history to share in this film. Soon they added other members to the group and started their long journey to success. It was not long when success turned their way, and Frey and Henley recognized their first guitarist, Bernie Leadon, was not happy with the group and causing turmoil. They brought in Joe Walsh, and then Randy Meisner left, and Timothy B. Schmidt took his place, and finally a big rift with Don Felder occurred.  We are privy to some of the onstage antics between Fender and Henley, and this was the beginning of the end of the first run. So, in 1980 the group came to an end. Everyone went their own ways. Henley and Frey started single careers and were successful.

In 1994 the group was asked to reunite. Joe Walsh had been in rehab, and was playing better than ever. Schmidt, Frey, Henley, Walsh and even Fender came back. However, Fender was never happy and after a few months he left the band. The reunion was a big success, went on touring for several years to packed houses. The men had matured, they all had families and children. No drugs or alcohol on this tour, and they played better than ever.

Everyone has a say in this film. It is honest in many respects. Of course, Henley and Frey play big parts. They wrote most of the songs and started the band in its infancy. The music is fantastic, brought back many memories. Don Henley gives his input about the meaning of 'Hotel California', no demons no beasts, but from his viewpoint, ""From innocence to experience, is the meaning of Hotel California."" Many, many people have decried the lyrics as demonic, but it has a very simple message.  Irving Azoff lets us know that 'The Eagles, Greatest Hits' was the biggest selling album of the 20th Century,  1 million records a month were sold for 18 months. He and the Eagles members feel not enough credit was given to the band for that record.

All in all, a fabulous documentary enough to give us a good feel for the band and it's members. Sad to see them age, but then, it is a glimpse of us.

5668745,4,B00BRBIABM,"Very well done documentary about a seminal 70's band.  My personal musical tastes are nowhere near the Eagles - don't care for country rock, soft rock, Bob Seger, Jackson Browne, or Ronstadt.  I think Henley's and Frey's solo output is some of the worst dreck ever pushed out to the masses. But for some reason I can't understand, I like a lot of the Eagles output.  I've heard they have an interesting history, so I figured I'd check out the doc.

Frey and Henley don't come across too well, in my opinion - the former seems a bit of a arrogant bully and the latter a pseudo-intellectual.  Joe Walsh has more rock and roll cred in his little finger than the other two do combined, and it was sort of sad hearing about his journey through addiction.  Don Felder is clearly not well liked by his band-mates, and it's up to the viewer to determine whether or not that dislike is warranted; I sort of sympathized with his position, personally. Schmitt, Meisner, and Leader get good amounts of screen time as well.

Despite the unlikable personalities, if you are a fan of the Eagles this is a must see.  It is very well put together, there's lot of cool old footage, and it tells a good story.  I only docked it one star because the last hour (about the reunion and afterwards) sort of drags on a bit.",1436745600,,1298,4.420168067226891

5668758,2,B00BRBIABM,"This was a fascinating look at the history of one of the most successful bands in history and there was a lot of wonderful footage, which makes this worth watching. However, I can't get over how ungracious Frey and Henley are. It's obvious that their egos caused the loss of several wonderful members of the band. Bernie Leadon was key in establishing their sound in the early days, and that's when their best work happened in my opinion. It's obvious that Frey's temper and the Frey-Henley greed clique sank the band.

I also think they didn't give enough credit to Poco, the band from whom they stole their initial sound, and then later the bass player. The only thing mentioned was a derogatory comment about Timothy Schmidt playing for years in substandard gigs for too little money. Poco never achieved the commercial success of the Eagles, but were much more authentic and not so commercially self-aware. I'm sorry, but none of the Eagles' songs ever approached the artistic level of ""Rose of Cimarron.""

A bit more humility and generosity might have kept the band together longer, but those ingredients were in short supply in the Eagles. The final quote of the documentary tells the whole story. I'm paraphrasing, but it was something like this; ""We wanted to be a band for our time. But if you do a good enough job, you become a band for all time."" This would have been a great quote if it had come from someone else. But Glenn Frey said it himself.",1434844800,,1458,4.647286821705427

5668765,4,B00BRBIABM,"A nice telling of the drama that went on with the Eagles. Nice soundtrack. I love the earlier Eagles stuff. It tells how they met each other through Linda Rhondstadt playing backup. Went on their own to flounder for a little while then met their producer Bill Szymczyk (wow live with that name!),
who loved them from their first meeting and stayed with them through thick; (drugs & girls) and thin. Sad they couldn't get past their egos and greed to go on to make more good music. So much talent. Anyway it's quite a story if you like the Eagles.",1432857600,,546,4.415841584158416

These guys are geniuses Period! They ran the band they way it needed to be run and while Don Felder has amazing talent, he comes across as a jealous, whiny ungrateful child. Glenn & Don H., watching this made me love you more than ever! I have no idea how one could come away from watching this with any other reaction but admiration for you both.

5668779,3,B00BRBIABM,"While I love the Eagles and have been a fan for decades, I was honestly disappointed in this documentary because it did not include their warmth and humor, the hilarious shared moments of travelling and performing together.  The documentary seemed determined to mine the dark side of this beloved band and therefore presented a skewed picture. I missed the all too human side of the band, as with any group of people, there are wonderful stories to share, funny times. That would have been a more realistic view. The documentary was too cold and remote for such a colorful and endearing group of people. These songs are in many of our hearts and memories over the years. The Eagles created an inner landscape of love songs, the wide open road, social commentary and delightful harmonies. I love them and hope that Part 2 is a much happier view of these folks.  Ultimately, this documentary is too cold and grim for this group.",1430265600,,926,4.709876543209877

5668832,3,B00BRBIABM,"This is a very entertaining documentary, fascinating to anyone who enjoyed the music of the Eagles.  The big negative is that it is strongly biased in favor of Frey and Henley.  With the exception of Timothy Schmidt, all the negatives of the other members are exposed and diagnosed.  With Joe Walsh, the negatives are presented in a sympathetic way.  Hardly anything bad is mentioned about the 2 main guys.  No mention of Henley, the great environmentalist, using a lear jet to fly his girlfriends to various towns on their tour.  Felder gets the shabbiest treatment; they won't let him sing because he's not as good as Henley, yet Joe Walsh isn't held to that same standard.  Worst of all Felder doesn't want to do benefits for politicians on the far left.",1423180800,,757,4.732824427480916

5668844,5,B00BRBIABM,"I am a huge Eagles fan and have been since the 70's.  I am not going to be one of those people to claim to be the biggest Eagles fan in the world.  I am a huge fan, and senselessly passed up a few opportunities to see them perform live duing the reunions.  I read most the books about the Eagles that are out there, including Don Felder's book.  I know the Eagles claim for this all true, and believe it is true.  However,  I think a lot of thing have been omitted.  What it comes down to is, it is their docoumentary they can put in or leave out what they want.

I really like watching music documentaries.  This is the best I have even seen.  Plus, that is going up some other good ones.  That might explain why I continue to watch this multiple times.  It really reveals things that none of the books do.  I thought I knew who my favorite Eagle was, but after watching this documentary, I am not too sure, now.  I am not only and Eagles fan, but I am also a fan and bought every solo album of Don Henley, Glenn Frey. Timothy B. Schmit and both of Don Felder's.  I have also seen Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and Joe Walsh in their solo concerts and saw Bernie Leadon when he preformed with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, so I am of fan of both Eagles whether they are performing together or solo.  I am really happy to see this documentary not only covered the Eagles in the 70's, but it included their solo careers, and the reunions.  I am not even get into the situation surrounding the departure of Don Felder.  If you watch this, you will have to form your own opinion.  I also liked that they have a lot of commentary from David Geffen, J.D, Souther, and Irving Azoff, who all a hand in and were instrumental in the success of Eagles.

In conclusion, I would say it is extremely informative.  It is very detailed. It may change any pre-conceived opinons you have about the individual members.  If you are die hard Eagles fan it is a must buy, if you are a casual Eagles fan it also a must buy, if you are not an Eagles fan but a fan of music documentaries is a must see.  I really believe it the best I ever seen.",1421798400,5,2113,4.125

This covers a lot of territory and touches on some hot issues, without being overbearing. It covers multiple viewpoints, which is refreshing.

It's cool seeing some of the equipment used. I'd heard that about this video and that's what originally got me interested in it.

5668869,2,B00BRBIABM,"Some interesting footage of the early years of the band. It's obvious this is a Frey and Henley showcase (70% of the time interviewed) the rest are spliced in between. Watch the press footage in which Frey and Henley answer 98% press Q&A. Felders book is obviously true after watching this - he was a humble musician trying to make a living with SOB's. I was in bands for years, never as big as The Eagles, but i've seen greed, deception, booze/drugs and ego on a smaller scale. Like Felder I thought I was in a group but it was ""never"" the case it was a ""king"" and his ""commoners"" who are supposed to be grateful but NEVER question the king or ""gods"" (Henley/Frey/Azoff) method in dealing with ""your earnings.""

What strikes me is that The Eagles don't seem to realize they were/are a harmless pop band; half of whose members thought they were in a rock band; the other half in a country band.  There is a reason your mom likes them.  They were not at all dangerous or groundbreaking or even that innovative,  Good, yes, talented, yes, but about as vanilla as music gets.  Should be titled ""Eagles: A History of Meh"".  Oh, and Glen Frey is an egomanic and a comes off as a total a-hole throughout.",1419552000,,514,4.247422680412371

5668877,5,B00BRBIABM,"I purchased this DVD for my father for Christmas.  He loves the Eagles and is always playing their songs with his band.  In his own words, these are ""the songs that he was listening to when I was your age""-- so I took note and surprised him!  We sat down together and watched the whole thing on Christmas morning and we absolutely loved it.

The first DVD follows the about 3/4ths of the bands' history.  It takes you from the founding members' childhood all the way to the pivotal 1980 breakup and highlights the solo careers of Glenn Frey, Don Henley and Joe Walsh.

The second DVD follows the 1994 reunion special (Hell Freezes Over ) and shows us the band today, with their families, how they've grown, changed but still remain timeless.

The bonus DVD is an incredible, professionally shot concert from 1977 in Washington, DC.

The amount of footage from their earliest years, their songwriting sessions and simple ""day in the life"" activities is positively astounding.  The production is top notch.  There's almost 4 hours of goodies here!

I am extremely glad I chose this as a gift for my father.  It was great to see how much he enjoyed it and it was doubly wonderful to learn about and appreciate the cultural icons from his era.",1419465600,8,1239,4.607305936073059

5668910,3,B00BRBIABM,"This is an entertaining, interesting, and well made documentary. But let's be honest and also stress that it is also heavily sanitized. Henley and Frey are artists and angels who dabbled in too many drugs and women along the way, but that's the extent of the confession. In contrast, Joe Walsh has to air his dirty laundry about drug abuse at length, Don Felder is attacked repeatedly and made out to be the bad guy. Yet no warts are revealed from the two main stars. For example, Henley's penchant for prostitutes, documented in multiple sources is completely glossed over. It would appear from this documentary that Don and Glenn never fought, never disagreed. Also glossed over is the fact that we have the Eagles to thank for the soaring concert tickets prices that began in the 1990s with their return. So by all means, check this out. If it were a book, this would clearly be the ""authorized biography."" I prefer something a little more honest.",1416787200,3,950,4.728915662650603

5668926,3,B00BRBIABM,"Having grown up listening to The Eagles it was great see the early footage about the foundation and roots of the band. However, after seeing the documentary in it's entirety I'd say that it asks one question: Can a talented, successful musician and songwriter also be an arrogant, obnoxious jerk. After listening to Glenn Frey blather on for a bit the answer is most certainly ""yes"". Mr. Henley may come off a little better but not by much.

These two come off especially bad when weighed against the attitude of former bandmates Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and Don Felder. None of them seems to have the bitterness and animosity that still shines through from Frey's smug musings. Note that Henley will only refer to Don Felder as ""Mr. Felder.""

In addition, there doesn't seem to be any hesitation to showcase Joe Walsh's struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. His wasted state is shown fairly graphically in a series of photos, interviews and concert footage. While none of this is any surprise why isn't any of this focus placed on the two ""leaders""? Messrs. Henley and Frey will say only ""Hey man. It was the 70's. Everyone was doing coke.""

Isn't it interesting that the second part showcases Walsh's problems while painting Henley as the saintly savior of Walden Woods. (I'm not quite sure what this has to do with a history of the Eagles other than to paint Henley in as good a light as possible) There's certainly no mention of Henley's1980  arrest when a drugged out 16 year old was found at his home. Nope....none of that. And certainly much has been written over the years about Henley and Frey's disagreements but there's none of that here. Only Frey's versions of why Leadon and Meisner left the band and Felder's later firing.

I find it interesting that in the current interviews done with the band that Henley and Frey were filmed separately. As the two purported leaders of the group it seems a bit odd that they weren't shown together. But then, why would they be. It's fairly obvious that Eagles Inc. is just a money making endeavor for them and that any pretense to it ""being about the music"" evaporated long ago. Just listen to how quickly the supposedly enviro-friendly Henley glosses over the fact that the ""Long Road out of Eden"" CD was marketed exclusively through Walmart, one of the most noxious corporations on the planet. ""Oh, they've done some very green friendly things recently"" says Henley. Uh huh. Yes.....green as in padding the pockets of these two heroes.

On the whole it was an interesting documentary to watch but afterwards I felt a bit dirty and really lost a lot of respect for these two. It doesn't change the fact that they put out some great music but it does color it a bit differently for me.",1415404800,10,2742,4.6902286902286905

I feel sorry for great musicians like Joe Walsh having to play this crap. Don Felder is better off on his own, same with Randy & Bernie.

It's the rest of the story leading up to present day.  While I give great credit to Henley and Frey for their musical abilities, I give them no credit for humility.  It is readily apparent in the interviews of both of them, just how narcissistic they are.  And Henley, my God man - lighten up !  Nobody likes a serious person all of the time.  While I treasure their music to this day,  I refuse to pay the exorbitant concert ticket prices - especially since they kicked Felder out of the band.  Much like KISS, this band is controlled by two guys.  The rest of the band would be replaced by machines if they thought they could get away with it.",1414713600,7,788,4.328767123287672

5668937,2,B00BRBIABM,"Fatuos, self serving drivel from Frey. Henley is a bit better. The finest songwriter, singer and musician in the band was latecomer Joe Walsh, who has a timeless body of work that far exceeds anything the Eagles did. Yes the Eagles sold a ton of records and had a handful of great songs, but the music was dated 20 years ago... with the exception of Walsh's contributions. I had to laugh when Henley, referring to Walsh joining the band, said (paraphrased) ""We're getting a worse singer than Bernie Leadon..."". Henley and Frey have a lot to be proud of but their self-importance is stupefying. 25 years from know, people will remember Joe Walsh's body of work, but virtually NOBODY will listen to or remember the Eagles.",1414627200,2,720,4.722222222222222

5668940,4,B00BRBIABM,"This is a very nice ""collector"" package; the Eagles always tried to do (and did) artwork and packaging that was consistent with their projected image - few fans would be disappointed with the set.  Frey and Henley are basically the core of the interviews; but fans of the band will find plenty to enjoy.  All of the members are shown giving short interviews when relevant to the events being presented, and the ""first band"" concert clips are gems.  If you were fortunate enough to see Randy Meisner sing ""Take it to the Limit"" live, you were very fortunate.  Truly transcendent. On the other hand, most true ""fans"" already have the majority of what is presented here that is worthy of subsequent viewing.
The content of the actual 'history' is mainly the Frey and Henley show.  Not that the case can't be made that they were two of the most important members; they probably are/were.  However, history should give some information to the backgrounds of the other two founding members, who in their own way, were as important to the Eagles' early success, and certainly, the longevity of the group.  The interviews reinforce, for perhaps the umpteenth time, that this is really about Henley and Frey.  And Frey says exactly that.  It also reinforces what a tool Glen Frey is.  And this is from a long-time rabid fan, who was fortunate enough to see the Eagles live numerous times, and not only followed them as a collective but the subsequent individual careers of all, including Meisner and Leadon.
I'm a fan of the whole ""country rock"" genre, and followed POCO, The Dillards, Chris Hillman, JD Souther, and so on.  The Eagles illustrate the curiosity that ""Fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free"".  And I don't think Henley was saying how lucky he was when he wrote that.
  Which brings us back to the interviews and Frey.  I do understand his point about the supposed reason Meisner left the band; if in fact it was about singing ""that"" song.  Other sources verify that Meisner was becoming increasingly reluctant to be the ""showcase"" of the encore. Other historical articles have alleged Meisner was unhappy with the stranglehold Frey and Henley were starting to exert.  One of the problems with 'documentary"" style presentations, (like this one) especially when all seem to participate, is you only get the ""truths"" the artists allow. I would highly recommend that ""fans"" of the Eagles read some of the other books about them out there; usually you can sift through it all and find the probable truth.  Anybody with knowledge of previous Eagles' history knows full well, (contrary to any denials), that Frey and Henley ran the show.  Again, Frey makes no bones about it, when he speaks to the issues with Mesiner and Felder - more so Felder.  Frey's position that he and Henley deserve more money (considerably more, apparently) because they kept the band in the public eye would be laughable, if he wasn't so adamant that Henley's and his solo careers kept people interested in the Eagles.  One could make that argument regarding Henley, if indeed that was the case.  Like say The Beatles are still relevant because of Paul McCartney and Wings.  Hard to swallow. Ironically, Frey earlier remarks on the good fortune the Eagles enjoyed when the ""classic rock"" format was introduced just about the time the Eagle broke up.  It was always about the music, (ironic again that two staples - ""Take it to the Limit"" and ""Hotel California"" were primary products of discarded members.)
True ""Fans"" love all they can find out about their favorite band - and this does provide an absolute treasure of lots of little things, here and there that you won't find elsewhere.  Everyone else can watch it on Netflix, just for the story.  I doubt you'll watch it twice.",1414540800,4,3765,4.7984496124031

5668943,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is a superb rockumentary.  It begins at the beginning, with Freys association with Bob Seger in Detroit and his living arrangement with Jackson Browne in Echo Park.  Price point is the essential element in their decision to share a rental, but in listening to Brownes endless repetition of the same riffs and melodies Frey learns how to write musicessentially by working very, very hard.

Frey and Henley are hired to back up Linda Ronstadt and they eventually form their own band.  Leadon leaves because he wants more country and less rock (he is an excellent banjo player); Randy Meisner leaves and we get the longstanding lineup with Schmit, Felder, Walsh, Henley and Frey.

Henley acknowledges that it is Freys band and we see him play a strong leadership role.  What we do not see are examples of Henleys perfectionism, the endless practices and rehearsals fueled by controlled substances.  We see many segments of the band in performance, with clips that are just long enough to be satisfying without taking our attention from the documentary narrative.

The most noteworthy aspect of the three-hour story is its honesty.  Freys altercation with Felder at the Alan Cranston benefit performance is depicted at length and in depth.  We hear the threats; we see Felder destroy one of his acoustic guitars (the cheapest, Frey informs us) and we await the post-performance violence which Felder manages to elude.

We hear at length of Joe Walshs alcoholism and cocaine abuse.  We see him high; we see the ravaged face and the halting speech and then we hear him sing and play after hes clean.  Frey comments as the story evolves.  We also hear Freys comments on Felders affection for cash and Frey and Henleys plan to change the financial model after the band is reunited.  They write the songs, for the most part.  They are the founding members of the band.  They are the leadership; this is not a democracy.  Democracies don't work in bands.  Hence they want a larger share of the take.  Schmit and Walsh are OK with that; Felder is reluctant.  Eventually Felder is fired.  We also hear about their disagreements with David Geffen and how they began with Asylum and left and how Henley eventually signed with Geffen again, and then left.  There is talk of lawsuits and out of court settlements.

As other reviewers have noted, we hear virtually nothing concerning their wives, lovers and families, though there is a brief segment concerning the importance of family and a glimpse, e.g., of Joe Walshs daughter.

For those whose principal interest is in the music, there is music aplenty, including the backstory on some of the songs (Life in the Fast Lane: a statement made by a heavy duty, carrying drug dealer, flying across the L.A. freeways with an apprehensive Frey sitting at his side).  For those who want the inside scoop on the bands dynamics, chemistry and methods, there is a great deal of information.

An additional disc contains material from a 1977 concert at the Capital Centre in suburban Washington, D.C.

In general, the narrative is always interesting, sometimes riveting.  You learn far more than you usually do in these sorts of stories (e.g., the bands with whom Schmit performed during the 14-year hiatus, some very surprising).  Frey handled the editing of the music for the three hours and, as expected, it is exquisite.",1413936000,34,3354,4.8953900709219855

It was advertised as having a 1977 ""Concert"" as the third disc. It was not a ""Concert"". It was a few of the hits they played that night, maybe 5?.
It seems like another money grab by Henley and Frey.
I lived in Buffalo when they first reunited and had tickets to see them at the Bills stadium. They didn't sell enough tickets (at $80 each then) so they moved it to what was basically an amusement park about 50 miles away. Needless to say my friends and I did not attend.
They are doing these things to make more money only. I am disappointed. I am sorry I bought this although they are my favorite band.

5668974,5,B00BRBIABM,"Even though it's been out for a while I thought l'd take a shot at History of the Eagles even though most have seen it by now and it's not a hot topic anymore. I watched it about 3 or 4 times and really enjoyed it and l found myself thinking more than once that this is how documentaries should be made. Originally aired on showtime, there's a lot to love about HOTE to point where it will likely receive multiple viewings. In terms of of length, what is covered, interviewing all those responsible, getting the dirt and being unbiased and letting fans see for themselves it stands as one of the best and most detailed music documentaries l have ever seen (and l've seen a lot). It's interesting to sit back all these years later and watching the aging band tell us all about their lives as The Eagles and their take on specific events. It really puts things into perspective.

History of the Eagles gets it right for many reasons. One of which is it covers the whole story. We get two discs split in two parts: one devoted to the early years up until the breakup in 1980, the other covering the solo careers and projects during the 80's through the 1994 reunion up to a new album to now. In total, a little over three hours devoted completely to the band. A lasting treat for fans, die-hards or otherwise. All the disputes, arguments, and nasty band member breakups are all laid out here for us by the Eagles in their own word. I can says in all honesty that even non-Eagles fan could enjoy it (especially the first part which really captures some of the essence of the 1970's) for it is such an entertaining, fascinating look at musical icons and the dynamics that goes on within a band. In essence, what makes a band work.

From Don Henley and Glen Fry's beginnings in Texas and Detroit forming early bands backing Linda Ronstdat to forming the Eagles, recording, touring, becoming successful, band members leaving, new band members, breaking up, solo careers, getting back together and still being active... It's all there. All the tensions, stories, events leading up to the split, the split itself all the way down to personal animosity, finances, it's all there and very detailed and in your face.

Highlights? There are too many,  and l don't want to spoil anything but when they talk about the fight that lead up to Don Felder leaving the band, it's a talking point. Everyone gets very emotional and it's hard to ignore that beneath all the music and the success some people in the band must've absolutely hated each other. One of my favourite moments happens after early on showing footage when The Eagles have just performed a successful (sold-out?)  show and they're sitting in the back of a van being driven to their hotel. Henley doesn't look at the camera when he says in almost utter discouragement ""band last longer than they used to you know? Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones. Maybe we can stick around for another couple more years"". The pun being obviously that they're still around to this day and their longevity and how they managed to transcend generations is the stuff legends are made of.

The only problem l perceive with the documentary is that people watch it and then disagree and/or take sides with people in the band. And then they hate what they see or hear and decide ""well this person is wrong""-and that's staying polite!- l've had discussion with other fans who've seen it and they seemed genuinely bothered by some of the content. Perhaps this can also be used to point out how effective it manages to be.

Oh and hey! The extra disc of a 1977 footage from the Hotel California tour doesn't hurt one bit but it's maddening that we didn't get a full concert. Other than that, two disc, three hours of content on one of world's finest bands and respected artists? Can't go wrong with History of the Eagles. It's all real and it's all there. 5/5  (there is content on alcohol, drugs, addictions and female nudity in the documentary in case you're wondering if this appropriate for all ages, the box doesn't say so!)",1409788800,10,4049,4.590594744121715

5668991,4,B00BRBIABM,"I watched the history for the first time, and there are a great many positives to this. First and foremost is all the old footage and interviews that were included. In a lot of these kinds of things you hear people talk about how things used to be, here you get to see the old interviews, and see how the guys have changed over the years. Very cool to see the 60s footage of Ronstadt and the Eagles together, and see how the band came together.

I also liked a look into the business part of what they did, and how that evolved in the industry over the years.

I see some complaints about how this is a Frey and Henley production. Well as Frey pointed out, someone has to be in charge, like it or not. I run a company, and I think it would be very difficult to have five equal partners at the top of a company, and with bands that is often what you have. In this case there were five guys, and they were jockeying for control and influence. In a company everyone knows who is the boss, and what their relative rank is. While they may not all agree with all the decisions, they at least accept who is the boss. In a band it often is not clear, and there lay many of the problems.

So yes, this was told from the point of view of Frey and Henley. While the other members of the band are huge, and contributed greatly to the sound and success, Frey and Henley are the leaders and are the songs.",1407974400,3,1391,4.087912087912088

Another thing that really made it great based upon how it was presented, was that every band members' stories were very similar their point of view.  In my opinion this made it much better and there was really very little ""mud-slinging"" going on among current and former band members.

I found Glen Frey a bit egotistic and some of the interviews a bit biased but overall this is a great documentary and story of a great band that in my opinion were finished in 1980 and the music they produced after then pales in comparison. Which is why I did not enjoy the 2nd DVD quite as much with the music not doing it for me.
What is the big plus for this 3 disc set is the 3rd bonus disc concert from 1977. This is a magnificent show of the band in great form with all their great songs performed. The booklet is mostly a photo book of the band from the various line ups.",1406332800,,740,4.006756756756757

5669039,4,B00BRBIABM,"First off, in the 70's, I considered myself a hardcore Eagles fan, so I was eagerly anticipating this documentary. In fact, I subscribed to Showtime for a month to see it as soon as I could then proceeded to watch it several more times on demand. I basically ordered the DVD to get the eight-song Hotel California tour concert bonus DVD which was worth it alone.

SPOILER ALERT:  Do not read any further if you want to like Glenn Frey.

If every story needs an antagonist and a protagonist, then Glenn Frey and Don Henley fit the bill nicely in this narrative. To me, Henley came off as the creative driving force of the group, while Frey simply showed himself to be an unabashed (rhymes with ""pick"").

What this documentary showed me was that every major conflict and departure in the history of the Eagles (Leadon, Meisner, Felder, Glyn Johns) had its roots in some form of conflict with Frey. And, though the Eagles say they had no say in the making of the documentary, I found it curious that none of the above departed (save for Johns) had the last word about why they left. Hence, in my mind, there's some ""History of the Eagles"" that was left out. In press interviews, Henley even noted they left a lot of stuff out that they didn't want their kids to see.

Further, the largest conflict in the history of the band, that between Frey and Henley which, by all accounts manifested in the two of them speaking to each other only through their respective assistants during the Hotel California/Long Run years, was ignored in the documentary, save for Henley noting something to the effect, ""And, by then, even Glenn and I weren't getting along.""

Further, the History of Eagles makes no bones about the fact that it was money that reunited them in 1994, not any great desire to work together again. This was bolstered in my mind by Frey's claim that he and Henley kept the Eagles name alive during their hiatus and that they should earn more money than Felder, Walsh and Schmidt upon their return.

Long story short, if you're an Eagles fan, and even if you're not, the History of the Eagles documentary is very entertaining (though the second half, chronicling their reunion in '94 to the present day, stretched on a bit long) however, for hard-core Eagles fans, there's not much new, other than some of the old home movie footage and the bonus concert CD. As I said above, it's worth the price for the bonus CD but, if you're looking for ""full"" history of the Eagles, this is lacking a bit.",1404000000,3,2495,4.555803571428571
5669040,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is a riveting story about my favorite band of all time, The Eagles. From the childhood stories of Don and Glenn, to the formation of the band, the stories behind the hits, the breakup, the reunion, the triumphs and the turmoil that is the American band, this DVD set fills in all the blanks you ever had about one of the most iconic and intreaging musical groups in American history.

Warning: Do NOT watch this with young kids. It contains very real footage of a young rock band's daily tribulations, and several scenes, a lot of subject matter and much of the language is not appropriate for kids.

Again, as The Eagles are my favorite band, I was absolutely captivated by this story and have watched it over and over. If you are an Eagles fan, this purchase is well worth the money.",1404000000,2,790,4.479166666666667

5669050,1,B00BRBIABM,"I ordered this in March and put it in my collection for viewing later.  It was shipped by an Amazon affiliate called Warehouse Deals, Inc.  I put it in my Sony player today, and disc one and disc two played fine.  Disc three, which is supposed to be a 1977 concert, hangs my player.  I have tried to play it several times with the same result.  I tried in in my computer BluRay played and it doesn't play.  You can look at the contents of the disc but it may be an illegal copy.  I tried to return it for a replacement, because the first two discs are great and I would like to see the 1977 concert, but Amazon reports that the window for replacement has passed.

Also, when you do a bit of internet research, it appears that the creators left out quite a bit of material that shows even more of a negative light on the founders of the band. But what is included in the documentary is very well done. It's just seemingly incomplete.",1401235200,2,444,4.235294117647059

5669057,5,B00BRBIABM,I will get to the heart of the matter right here.  I did not buy this to learn about the history of the Eagles.  I bought it for the fantastic but way too short 45 minute concert footage from the Hotel California tour in 1977.  It is rare to get both great audio _and_ video from a concert video of that era...you get both with this one.  Maybe one day I will watch the documentary that goes with this.,1400284800,,402,4.050632911392405

5669063,5,B00BRBIABM,"I've been a fan of the Eagles since I ""discovered"" them back in the Hotel California era (I was in High School).  Over the years, I've collected several of their CD's, and, this August, I'll be seeing their concert.  It was great to hear from all of the band members as well as Linda Rondstadt, Jackson Browne, Bob Seger and others, and see how everything intertwined in the ""early days,"" as the band formed and matured.  The additional disc (the 1977 Washington DC Hotel California concert) is a nice addition, but, in my opinion, kinda pales compared to the documentary... of course, they were produced nearly 35 years apart, so that's kinda to be expected.  Technically, the video and the sound quality are great, and the integration of ""vintage"" material with current and past interviews is seamless.

5669069,5,B00BRBIABM,"The bonus disc of the 1977 concert was itself worth the price of the set. The video quality of that concert was just okay but the sound was excellent.

5669082,5,B00BRBIABM,"Alison Ellwood and Alex Gibney, I take my hat off to you. (Which I don't do for many people, because it shows my giant bald spot.)

As a writer for print, I'm rarely impressed by TV writers, documentary or otherwise, but you've managed to do that. What it seems to me you've done is to use a trick that I learned as a print journalist -- trust the audience to pick up on the salient facts without you beating them over the head with them. Sometimes all you have to do is let your subjects talk, even if you privately think they're idiots or liars, or both; it's often unncessary to point that out, because if they're as bad as you think, they'll do it themselves.

Let me explain what I mean. I had read Felder's book, and while I did come away with the impression that Henley was a bit of an egotistical ass and, maybe to a lesser extent, Frey was, I also thought Felder himself came off at times as silly, self-serving and petty. He had some good points, yes, absolutely, but he was stepping on his dick by grinding some pretty dull axes alongside the main one. But here's where the film excels -- by letting Glen Frey talk so much, so unfiltered, they made the unmistakable point that he is the Giant Douche (sorry, that seems to need the emphasis of caps, despite my usual avoidance of such) of this band.  It's nearly impossible to come away from watching that film without grasping that his massive, moronic ego was the cause of the hollowing out of this band that was often the soundtrack of my teens. By his own words, you see that Leadon, Meisner and Felder all left because of his childish little hissy fits.

There are other places where he takes a crap and carefully sits in it, too, but the funniest in this context are his insistence that he purposely sang less and less to let Henley sing more; given all we see of his ego, that is comical. Yeah. Glen selflessly gave up his lead vocals for Henley's 'golden throat'...(grin)

That's why he now sings Meisner's 'Take it to the Limit' even though that's clearly in Schmidt's range and way the hell out of Frey's. In that vein also is his insistence that Bernie had to go because he, Glen, is not a country singer... yet even when he tries to rock, that cornpone, grits-in-your-teeth, cowboy-phony accent that today's country singers fake comes through loud and clear. And every song Frey had any hand in writing is more country than anything else.

What about the laughable claim that he and Henley deserved more money because ""they were the only ones that kept the Eagles name alive during the hiatus by recording solos? His macho braggadocio about ""standing up to Tom Cruise,"" and his BS about what he said to Felder, Meisner and Leadon? If true, they would be nothing to brag about, but it's hard to escape the idea that he embellished there, as well.

Yep, this guy's another Ted Nugent/Hank Williams, Jr.; another redneck waiting for his moment in the cracker sun. The filmmakers made that crystal clear.  And that Henley's a wanker comes across pretty clearly in his speaking parts, as well as his actions. He was free to stand up and fight, and he sort of did, and then ultimately decided to ally himself with the jerk. Obviously some douche in his family tree, too. I think its also great to show us, as they do, how much Henley thinks of his own voice, which, from a technical perspective is not great, just ok. That award he won in the '80s -- Male Vocalist of the Year, was it? -- was as much of a joke as it would have been if Fleetwood Mac had gotten a grammy for best Heavy Metal group.

They also made you feel bad  for Schmidt, Meisner and Leadon as well as Walsh, although I'm somewhat disgusted with his brown-nosing of redneck Batman and Robin.

But what the film did at the end was also brilliant -- while asserting that the remnants of the band had weathered all this and still discovered they could make good music without admitting their mistakes, they showed the opposite was true in spades. The music that has been made since they got back together is laughably bad, with very few exceptions -- and none that feature either Frey or Henley. What the film also reminds us is that for all his own douche quotient, Henley was a far better writer without Frey. ""The End of the Innocence"" and ""Boys of Summer"" far exceed any lyrical content he ever had with the Eagles; even his snarky side comes out better as a solo act (Dirty Laundry, All she wants to do is dance) than with the Eagles; Life is the Fast Lane is insipid, and merely proves that with a good Joe Walsh riff, any sort of pap sounds better (paging Richard Marx)... and don't even get me started on the predictability of ""Get Used To It"" and that trite 911 thing (Hole in the world?).

Bravo. That's good writing.",1397174400,3,4759,4.444954128440367

Avid fans of the Eagles will enjoy the review of the history of the band from the beginning to the present including some of the less than flattering events.  Even after viewing it several times, it still has much to offer.  The accompanying DVD of the 1977 Washington D.C. concert is choice.  It affords a chance for long-time fans to actually see Randy Meisner hit the high notes in ""Take It to the Limit"".

If you're a huge Eagles fan like myself, you will definitely want this DVD Collection in your music library.  I just wish it would have arrived with the DVD case in tact and I simply didn't want to go thru all the hassle of having it replaced so, the case is basically held together with clear tape.

5669104,5,B00BRBIABM,"If you enjoy Eagles music, music from the seventies-particularly the Southern California sound you will enjoy the story of how the Eagles came to be and contributed to the genre. Many critics opined that Frey and Henley come across as bullies and/or dictators. I disagree.",1394409600,,272,5.066666666666666
5669105,3,B00BRBIABM,"Ok,  First and foremost, I enjoyed this production.  As much as I believe Henley and Fry are control freaks, they commisioned a rather entertaining history of the Eagles.  Included are many good and rare concert footage from the 70's as well as interviews from the same periods.

With the above said I have some issues and it would have been nice to have had a really un-biased look at the band from all parties.  You will never hear Schmidt or Walsh utter anything negative about Fry or Henley,  Also, I have not heard those same two utter even one word in public about the termination of Felder either.  No doubt this is due to restrictions the two leaders of the band made on the outcome of Felder leaving.

While the video is very very entertaining, I felt there was too little of Leadon and Meisner.  The beer incident was covered in great detail when Leadon poured it over Frey's head, but one has to ask what type of atmosphere provoked this.  If Frey has always been a jerk to people in the band, I guess it was only a matter of time before people took a step back.  David Geffen also appears a few times and promoted the band early on during their initial success, then later sued by the band to get the last 1/2 of their publishing back.  Since the band signed the agreement and then settled out of court, was again surprised Henley had another relationship with Geffen's later company, and then again Geffen was trashed on video a second time......Just didn't understand that either.  In both cases, Geffen promoted the Eagles and Henley.  If they became popular in the mainstream, it was due to management even before Azoff was involved with the Eagles.
They probably needed to owe a debt of gratitude regardless to Geffen in my opinion since he marketed them to the public.  That was his job as a manager.  Why on earth would you bite the hand that feeds you?  They would have made millions regardless and once again, the bitterness and power over the money side of things was evident.

Also, I felt there was far too much time spent on Joe Walsh's substance abuse, recovery and related trashing of hotel rooms.  The speech Frey gave on Walsh on his treatment and recovery seemed to be written in to give a more favorable view of Frey as a concerned parent for a fellow band member, but again, little of this was shown to the other members of the band.  As he said the only reason he returned to the band was if He and Frey made more money than the others.....

The Felder issue is still a problem with me.  Having read his biography watched countless hours of interviews with him, I feel they treated him horribly in this production.  They allowed Felder to mention Eagles Limited, but discredit him and not even discuss the initial agreement for which he was a part of. They made it seem that Felder only had riffs and little ideas for tunes, but his embellishments went far above and beyond in this band.  This was not even covered.  Was it unfortunate that Felder had no interest in politics and had to go along with Frey's agenda?  You be the judge.  Where were the positive comments on Felder by Henley and Fry.  They so dismissed him in the video we only heard negatives.

Felder was part of Eagles Limited which initially gave the original members prior to the introduction of Walsh and Schmidt full equal share of dollars apart from their respective songwriting authorship.  When Felder shot back, he intended to not only help himself, but Schmidt and Walsh.  None of this was covered in the video.  I found Henley and Fry to be dismissive of how great a musician Felder was and how much he brought to the band.  A real video biography would have tried to find the good in each of the musicians, but not have it center around Frey and Henley telling the main story.",1394323200,6,3787,4.505865102639296

5669115,4,B00BRBIABM,"This is very enjoyable, and about as balanced a presentation as you could expect.  Everyone gets an opportunity to present their side of the story - with Frey & Henley getting more airtime than the others - but understandably so.

If I was to rate each disk individually, Part 1 (5 stars), Part 2 (3 stars), and the Concert Disc (4 stars).  If the third disk would have provided the COMPLETE vintage concert - it and the entire package would have earned that 5th star for sure.",1393027200,,477,4.459770114942529
5669116,4,B00BRBIABM,"This DVD is great for all the history of the Eagles - as told by the Eagles themselves. It includes some good music too. The '77 concert at the Cap Center in DC was disappointing. It's infused with post production updated music sound. There is no way they had the recording capabilities in '77 that you hear on this disk. But that's not all bad for those wanting good music. There are some instances where the chords and visuals of the guitars don't match what you are hearing. And there a some where the lips don't quite match the words in the songs. But, not bad.

For those who wish to see and hear a great contemporary Eagles session, I highly recommend the Melbourne - Farewell 1 Tour DVD. That's just flat out super visuals and sound. And they sound as good, if not better, than the late 70's.",1392854400,,799,4.3624161073825505

the talent of each of the group's members.  I noticed a while back that a person who saw them perform was critical
of how perfectly they executed each piece of music.  Apparently, that person never played a musical instrument himself.
Anyone who has played an instrument --strives for perfection!!  It is the name of the game.  If they executed their
music perfectly it is because they worked very hard to have it presented in a most successful manner.

If a person has not seen their movie, they have missed a totally enjoyable experience.",1392854400,,661,4.598290598290598

5669143,5,B00BRBIABM,"When the Eagles split up in in 80, that was it for me. Their ensuing 14 year absence of no new material nixed any love I had for this band, who'd been long rumored to be letting dope and egos destroy itself. I never knew the specifics behind that, but this DVD answers those questions, and then some. This is a pretty comprehensive story of the band from start to finish, filling in more gaps than I thought I had in my Eagles expertise. Frank and detailed stories and comments are told by everyone significant in the evolution of the Eagles, including several left by the wayside along the way, whom one wouldn't blame for bitterness or no comments at all. But whose contributions are as solid as any. This is loaded with the obligatory trademark music of the band who was best and last in putting a stamp on the California sound that started in the 60s, including some excellent early live footage of them and the many other future stars they chummed with on their way to the top. All with superb sound quality. When the band split up, I was more a fan of some singles rather than either as a soloist. I found Henley's solo material, despite a few brilliant moments (I believe ""Boys of Summer"" is one of the quintessential rock songs), to be hugely over rated stuff celebrated by Eagles starved fans. And given the possibilities of what could have been had the Eagles not split, I refused to accept a lesser product. The movie as it is, is perfect. But maybe that angle of the 14 years in the wilderness they spent, while leaving longtime fans dangling and scratching their heads before returning in 94, could have been touched on a bit more. But in not straying from a straight Eagles story it makes for a smoother flowing movie. Lots of us found ourselves asking of the possibilities that could have followed a back to back grand slam of ""Hotel California"" and ""The Long Run"" in that 14 year gap. And it kept leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. Which was why when they reunited, I refused to fork down the record high concert ticket prices to a band who blew me off and was now saying, okay pay us unprecedented amounts to see us play again. Whether you like the band or not, you learn enough to enhance or change your opinions. Me, I wonder if they blew a chance at being considered one of the greatest bands ever, not to be confused with favorite bands ever, which is more what they are to me. By the time they had arguably their best line-up and put out their 2 most critically acclaimed albums, they split up and provided solo milquetoast until their reunion a decade and a half later. I've disliked Don Henley since their split (in the end, I disliked Frey even more). But even reasons I had for that are addressed by Henley, who though I disliked his actions, it's hard to argue with his reasons why. This is maybe one of my favorite rock band biographies. And not just because I love the band. But because it's very informative, and very entertaining.",1390608000,2,2962,4.446691176470588

5669167,4,B00BRBIABM,"A good DVD set with 3 DVD's, The first one shows the start of the band but sadly the second one shows the break-up then the reforming and then the break-up again because of greed and ego's.
Yes Don Felder did whine a bit, if you read his book you will see that it's his side of the story but both Glenn Frey and Don Henley do come off as jerks. I think they all were at fault for the break-up, Yes they do most of the singing but Don Felder did help write Hotel California which helped them win a Grammy award which helped put more money in Glenn and Don's pocket. And they still play it without him in the band
It seems like greed and ego's break up a lot great bands Van Halen, Styx the list goes on. And it's sad that they don't list Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and Don Felder as past members because they were all part of one of the greatest rock bands ever. The Live DVD from 1977 is great but I wish it was the whole concert as some other reviewers noted. But why did they put Rocky Mountain Way in there? They should have put Desperado or Tequila Sunrise.

5669175,4,B00BRBIABM,"nteresting. Its a good watch I guess, but unfortunate in that it basically chronicles the downfall of the music industry leading to current day goings ons. In the end, all they care about is money, not music, not friendships, not fans... which is pretty pathetic. Personally, I find the arrogance of Don and Glen (who's egos the movie is basically all about) ridiculous, especially considering that they didn't even write many, if not most of the biggest 'Eagles hits. The way they treated/treat and talk about band members really gets on my nerves. Without those three original members which they seemingly so easily discarded and to this day do not give proper accolades, they would never have reached such success they see today. Talented musicians and great band, yes, but give credit where credit is due. Some of the music and rare footage is cool. The late 70's were an amazing time in American music... but those days are LONG gone. Funny how they downplay the hidden messages in their art/music, yet later go on to say they put our own messages into everything, but will never share what those are with anyone.

It is worth watching, but if you know anything about music, bands, that period of time or perhaps were there, most likely you'll be happy, sad and pissed off all at the same time as I was. Also, the brief, but graphic nudity in the film makes this unwatchable for children, which is again unfortunate.",1389052800,,1421,4.729838709677419

Awesome early footage, well put together.......I can't say enough positive about it. I know I like the Eagles but wow, I am so glad I bought this.
  Many people seem to think that Frey and Henley come off as egotistical and arrogant, but the fact is they really seem only concerned with what was best for the band and that does need to be the number one priority at all times. If the music isn't created to the best ability of the band then the customer is not happy and that is never good for the band.

It is without a doubt the best video set I've ever watched of it's genre.  Both videos had a little sadness, but the band and their music goes on.  I'm so happy about that!! The Eagles were without a doubt my favorite band in the 70's and they continue to be right up there!

They claimed that Felder just wrote the Chord progressions for Hotel California, but I've seen earlier interviews where Glenn Frey said that Felder had already written almost the whole song, and Don Henley and he wrote the Lyrics.  I've never heard Felder say anything derogatory about Frey or Henley publicly, but he did say that they seemed to want to rewrite history where he is concerned.

5669207,5,B00BRBIABM,"Wow! Just got through two nights of watching a Blu-Ray 3 disc ""History of the Eagles ... The Story of an American Band"". Indeed it was! Perhaps many of you have seen it, as it was on Show Time for awhile, but this was my first.

 It truly is the story of an American band. I was amazed at the parallels between their journey and my own while playing in a small-time Long Island band, Cottonwood sage, throughout the 70s. So much rang familiar ... we had everything but Linda Ronstadt!! [ and many several million dollars!] ;-)

 First disc covers them through their break-up in 1980 and was my favorite part ... building on their influences from Motown to western-swing to Poco/Flying Burrito Brothers/JD Souther/Linda Ronstadt. Many segments stroked chords within me and were quite emotionally satisfying. Second disc looks at their solo careers, the Reunion in 1994 and right on to the present. Two things stood out to me; the bittersweet departure of Don Felder - a guitarist that I just now fully appreciated - & the nearly tragic end of Joe Walsh. The reunion literally saved his life.

 All the great songs are here, Take it Easy, Tequila Sunrise, Hotel California, Desperado, Take it to the Limit, Rocky Mountain Way, and some new material that's pretty good, too. For me, it was pretty much my first time with the new stuff as I have been musically insulated during the 80s, 90s, and onward ... Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, Glen Frey, Don Felder, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh and Don Henley - all featured. All the soaring harmonies! My only issue was that I wish there had been some more of Timothy's great songs.

 Oh, third disc was a concert, or part of, from March, 1977. Vintage. Music to my ears. :-)

 Great stuff! The highs & the lows; the friendships & the pettiness that few bands can avoid. Highly recommended to fans of the 70s era music!",1385683200,9,1860,4.609090909090909

The first two discs cover the history of the Eagles and the third has excerpts from their 1977 Hotel California concert. It's unfortunate that they didn't just include the WHOLE concert.

I liked the current interviews of the guys talking about the old days. They admit to the drug use and all of the other things that went on but most of the them straightened up and cleaned up. I wish it had at least some recent concert footage but it's cool to see the old concert footage. Well worth the price to add to a collection. I highly recommend it for Eagles fans.,1384473600,,499,4.154639175257732

5669236,5,B00BRBIABM,"Lifelong or even recently-acquired fans of this supergroup should not be considered as such until they have seen this video. In fairness, best also to look online for differing opinions, such as from Don Felder...) and make up your own minds, but it is still a great insight.",1383004800,,275,4.75
5669237,5,B00BRBIABM,"One of the things that hits you before too many minutes into this superb documentary is the VISUAL style of the offering.

That's saying something, when it'll be the music alone that will take you through many viewings.

So: visually, simply superb, whether creative and compelling re-creations--especially of Don and Glenn's early lives--to the remember-when performance and backstage clips and the recording and concert footage of the band itself.

Some have suggested the whole story is a little sugar-y.  Not so: all the members tell it like it was and (more recently) has been, i.e.: Joe Walsh's drugs-and-booze marathons; the on-again, off-again Eagle membership of never-satisfied Don Felder and the bitter-sweet comings and goings of Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.

Sure, it's the singing and sound.  But above all...the songs. Man, what great, great songs.",1383004800,,867,5.385185185185185

5669245,2,B00BRBIABM,"The Eagles were part of the soundtrack of mine and my husband's dating time so I bought this thinking it would give me more insight into this band. It did, but not in a good way. Glen Frey came off as a complete jerk. Between he and Don Henley there is tremendous talent but also in evidence are some of the biggest egos I've ever seen. I would have liked a more balanced look at ALL the band members who contributed to their great sound in their own way, whether they wrote the songs or not. Also disappointed that the dvd of the previously unreleased concert material was so short with so few songs on it. I really expected more and felt a little ripped off.",1382486400,5,660,4.246031746031746

5669249,5,B00BRBIABM,"... what was left on the cutting room floor.  Certainly little in this documentary, as fine as it is, paints the band's leaders in a particularly good light.

Glenn Frey comes across as such a self-serving, arrogant SOB that it amazes me that the Eagles managed to stay together for nine MINUTES, let alone nine years.  As you listen to him, it becomes clear that he was responsible for each of the splits (first the beer incident that led to Bernie Leadon's resignation, then the badgering and goading that led to Randy Meisner's, and finally the under-handed business dealings and posturing that led to Don Felder's audit of the Eagles' books and his ultimate firing from the band).

Don Henley comes across as a driven perfectionist, but so heavy-handed that anyone who stood in his way - even Frey, his staunchest ally - got bulldozed.

Joe Walsh looks as if he's choosing his words VERY carefully, as if making sure that nothing he says offends Massas Glenn and Don.  He wants to keep his job, after all.

Timothy B. Schmit, likable as he is, offers little of value.

At least the exiles - Leadon, Meisner, and a surprisingly emotional yet un-bitter Felder - are allowed to contribute to the story.

The audio of the 1980 onstage fight between Frey and Felder alone makes this set a must-own - as does Randy Meisner's soaring performance of ""Take It To The Limit"" on the 1977 concert disk.

I'd like to think that the Eagles were about the music - that's what I, at least, would prefer to remember them by.  And oh, what music it was...",1382140800,5,1541,4.587591240875913
5669250,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is a wonderful documentary of the Eagles from seeing how their group was formed, to the break up, to the reunification....and everything in between.  The music is worth the price of the DVDs, but to watch how they write their songs, how they had to fight their management for decision-making status, how a few members came and went is fascinating.  We even get to see who and how the cover art for an album was made.  This is another ""movie"" that I watch every time I see that it is on cable!  It's a must-see!",1382140800,,515,4.333333333333333

5669254,5,B00BRBIABM,"Besides the ""Beach Boys"" The Eagles have to be right up there as being The Best American Band Vocals and songwriting!  This Blu Ray has it all from the begining to the break up, then the reunion then the break off Don Felder era...which I just don't understand!  I think Don Felder was a great asset to The Eagles and Glenn was foolish not to work somthing out with him.  Anyway, Randy Meisner footage and Bernie Leadon another AMAZING Guitar player this DVD has great old footage and interviews that are ver clear!  Now Joe Walsh, he is a true asset as well and such a great guitar player and singer too!  He tells great stories as well!  Glenn Frey seems to be the hardest to get along with but ""he is actually I think my favorite EAGLE because of his attitude and outspokenness.  Don Henley is definetely a great singer and very underated drummer!  Don has an AMAZING Voice!  Get this, you will not be disappointed!",1381708800,,918,4.449101796407185
5669255,1,B00BRBIABM,"Thank you for the opportunity of expressing my thoughts about the DVD, ""History of the Eagles"".  I am an Eagles fan.  We just traveled to Seattle in Sept. to see their concert (3 states away). However, I purchased the History of the Eagles for me, my wife and our children to enjoy.  I was disgusted by the crude language and especially the pornography in the DVD.  This was put together by a well known documentarian. I truly expected a little higher class coverage of the history of the eagles.  Was it really necessary to have the F word and other vulgarity throughout the DVD?  Was it really necessary to have a night club scene with a nude woman dancing?  I feel that if the content of this DVD included X rated material, it surely should have had the rating right on the site where the DVD was being sold.  I would encourage you to do that so future customers don't make the same mistake that I did.

Thanks!!",1381708800,7,915,4.398809523809524

5669258,4,B00BRBIABM,We watched this with our children and were shocked to see total nudity in the first disc.  That pretty much ruined the rest of it for us because we never knew what was coming.  Unfortunate that they had to include that making it not suitable for family watching.,1381622400,,262,4.4375
5669259,5,B00BRBIABM,"One of my favorite bands from back in the day, it was great seeing the early history of the Eagles, their many personal trials and decisions along the way, still one of the most prolific, longest running bands in history.",1381363200,,221,4.55
5669260,5,B00BRBIABM,"They tell it the way they lived it.  What a story, what a band!  Brought back great memories of the Hell Freezes over concert.",1381363200,,126,4.208333333333333
5669261,1,B00BRBIABM,"There some people out there that still believe Henley And Frey are The Eagles. If you are told something enough you tend to believe it such as America is the greatest country in the world. Hate to burst some bubbles but both are wrong. Im not surprised to see Henley and Frey dominate on screen a band is made up of however many members there are and should be equal. How would Hotel California sound if there were no guitar player??? pretty lame. Anyway Glenn Frey is either a Sociopath or insecure to the highest level it goes to show money doesent buy happiness because he comes across as bitter and angry why so angry Glenn you must have a billion dollars by now. $140 for an Eagles ticket haha i wouldnt have paid that back in 1975 i sure wouldnt pay it now your prime days are gone. I just cant stand to see such an attitude. Anyway there is something i wanna mention as a humor junkie remember the part where The Eagles did that benefit concert for Senator Cranston (spelling mistake maybe???) Don Felder says your welcome and then says I GUESS to me that is a little immature but funny. As you watch Glen Frey tell the story and after Henley says i guess it flashes to Felder quickly and i would swear from the look on Felders face he finds it funny as well. Glenn Frey didn't find it funny but wow talk about immature he sure handled it well didn't he what a crazy stupid temper he has. Control freaks like Glenn Frey don't like people who speak their mind and stand up for themselves they expect everyone to be yes men. Don Felder made some mistakes but the video further shows what scrooges and bullies Don and Glenn are. For those who don't know Felder did write the music to Hotel California but nowhere did you see Frey or Henley or anyone for that matter at least give him credit for it. Don Henley needs to not take himself so seriously!!! yes Don you are smart and well spoken but has no charisma. If i had his ability and money id be smiling all the time. Don Felder has aged the best and that is what comes from not being in a bad marriage and when i say bad marriage i mean married to The Eagles. Also the words Alpha Male were used a few times in this documentary who are the Alpha Males in this band??? the answer is none. Unless you call being a temper tantrum,insecure control freak an Alpha Male. Don Felder did whine a little here and there but it was Don and Glen for the most part that acted like it was their time of the month. Randy Meisner came across as the most kind level headed and confident member and had the purest voice. Don Henley and Glenn Frey over estimate their own contributions to the band a decent amount of their songs weren't fully written by either of them. Sometimes i wondered if they thought they were The Beatles. Would i go see The Eagles today??? nope not unless the ticket prices were more realistic and the set list was changed to include some non hits. For anyone who hasn't heard of the band  Poco  you need to check out them out they were every bit as good as The Eagles. Commercial success doesent exactly equal greatness.",1381190400,9,3084,4.306368330464716

The story seems a bit bent toward Henley and Fry, as you would expect if you are familiar with the dynamic of this group. Overall, I would recommend this to any Eagles fan, or anyone interested in the history of rock music. Read Felder's biography for a different perspective.",1381104000,,433,4.7105263157894735
5669266,5,B00BRBIABM,this is a must for any Eagles Fan.  Just wish the concert on the additional DVD was longer.  Purchased a 2nd copy just in case someone borrowed the 1st and didn't return.  He did and I'm still trying to get it back.,1380672000,,215,4.071428571428571

The Eagles are so great and so happy they got back together after such a long wait.  How could they have ever wondered it the public would welcome them back.  Their music is timeless.  Enjoyed getting insight on what many of my favorite plays expressed for them, for the comment on the world at that time.  Never gets old.  I love it!!!",1379548800,,449,4.211764705882353

The history itself is probably the best ""Behind the Music"" type video you will see. Interviews with ALL the band members; past and present. Not just the ones who are still in good graces.

5669286,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is an excellent documentary of the history of the Eagles.  I have heard from some that Glenn Frey and Don Henley perhaps seem a bit controlling, i.e., Our Way Or The Highway, but I didn't see it that way.  Bands of the past didn't stay together very long because of personal conflict.  You have to have someone take control and run things.  Don Henley and Glenn Frey put the band together and deserved more $$ than the other members.  They were very meticulous and were not just looking out for themselves.  Don Felder didn't seem to really understand this and wanted the same as they were getting, but that would have been unfair to Don and Glenn, in my opinion.  Don Henley and Genn Frey wrote most of the songs together and deserved more for this.  The Eagles music today is still very popular.  I have seen them in concert 5 times and they are an excellent band and excellent musicians.  If you like the Eagles you will enjoy this documentary time after time, because the music is what it is all about.  The Eagles music will last forever!!

It's very personal, complete with interviews from all former band members.  If you grew up with the Eagles, or have enjoyed their ""classic rock"" over the years, you would really enjoy watching this documentary with LOTS of Eagles music!",1378944000,,363,5.350877192982456

It has Randy Meisner singing his big hit ""Take It To The Limit""!!! Now they only sing 8 songs in the concert (I know I was tick off there were only 8 songs to) but its a Great Concert anyway. If your a Big Fan of the Eagles trust me you will want the live concert, even if you don't care about there history, but if you watch there history of why they broke up, you may find yourself coming away not caring to much for some or all of the members of America's Classic Rock Band of the 70's.",1378771200,,711,3.8767123287671232

If you are a baby-boomer and grew up in the 60's and 70's, the Eagles will take you on journey back through time. And if you happen to be an Eagles fan, sit down, buckle up, for you are in for an incredible ride! The people who put this together put a lot of time, thought and love into it.  I always loved the Eagles' music, but now I have much more respect and admiration for Don Henley and Glen Frey!  I have watched the DVD set twice now, and will watch it over and over again. I have recommended that my son, who is a musician, watch and learn from the hard lessons the Eagles learned over time.  The story, the film, the personal comments, are all impeccably put together.

5669300,1,B00BRBIABM,"Yes I am an EAGLES fan. I liked this doco as a publicity stunt snow job on Henley & Frey but I felt that Don Felder was not given enough screen time. This includes Glenn Frey saying Don Felder can't sing. HOGWASH! In talking about Felder singing. They NEVER put his vocals up for US to hear, to judge. Most unfair of all involved. Randy Meisner came to the EAGLES via Rick Nelson's Stone Canyon Band. That is not mentioned. They say he came from POCO to the EAGLES,,,Not true at all. Meisner quit POCO to join Rick Nelson's band then onto the EAGLES.

I would have liked to have more of Randy Meisner & Bernie Leadon talk more in the newer interviews. No it was the Henley & Frey show. Okay, Yeah they are the main men of that band. Now Felder wasn't too wise at handling band situations and Frey was a powder keg with a short fuse. Although Frey wouldn't mess with Bernie Leadon ( Because Bernie would wipe the bloody floor with Frey. Bullies are like that you know. They stay away from anyone who can rally give them a serious fight.)

Still it is a great band. They should have shown the full Rock N Roll Hall of Fame clip along with all the boys playing their 2 songs as a DVD extra and added as an extra longer interviews with Walsh, Schmit, Meisner, Leadon and Don Felder. Buy Felder's Solo CD ""Road to Forever."" but do NOT purchase it from the crooks at Import CD's in Irvine Ca.",1378166400,15,1386,4.246212121212121

5669302,5,B00BRBIABM,"The reviewers before me have pretty much summed this film up. I would put my money on 80% of the viewing demographic will have grown up with the Eagles and many of them, like myself, would know them first and foremost for their music. All of us have heard snippets of stories and probably read differing opinions as to how they imploded and reassembled and then generally just came and went again at random. Many of us would have been to a concert, possibly more than one and seen them in the flesh, marveling again at their magical ability to blend voices and instruments into some of the best music produced in modern times. This documentary knits it all together. There will be millions of words written online over the coming months and perhaps years critiquing this film for better or for worse.
I have adopted the stance that this is a group of musicians that are just as human as all the rest of us, extraordinarily gifted in their chosen fields and were at the intersection of preparation and opportunity just at the right time.

The addition of a copious amount of personal home movie footage, some never aired before adds the essential layer to the production and wraps the package up like a tightly constructed wine. I'm sure there are many who will be watching this who will see themselves in the background of some of the footage, even at the third encores and will will be gasping in their living rooms grateful for the fact that the passage of time is the best camouflage for human recognition.

5669305,5,B00BRBIABM,"When you consider the conflicts among the ever-fluctuating membership of Eagles, I would have expected this history to be a blame game - catty and self-aggrandizing. Not so - at least not totally so. The current Eagles membership are mature males now, and they're able to reflect on their glories, their mistakes, their conflicts with reasonable minds.

The package comes with 3 DVDs: the first years and coming together of the Eagles until their breakup. The second deals with the current lineups since the reforming after a 14 year layoff. The third and the only disappointment for me was a 1979 concert in Washington D.C. The sound is murky, the video grainy, and the concert itself all too short. But them I'm judging this DVD by modern standards, and that's unfair.",1377993600,,770,4.877862595419847

5669307,4,B00BRBIABM,"This documentary is fantastic, very well put together, and if you are even remotely a fan of this group it is worth the expense. I do have an issue with it, however, and if you intend to purchase this product you may wish to be aware of it.

The first two discs are superb; SIX stars. The third one is simply not up to that standard, however. It is a recording of a concert in Maryland recorded during the Hotel California tour back in the 70's. The group is great, sounds very good, and they had several cameras set up, so you got to see what was going on over the whole stage. Great. But -- here you go folks -- THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE WHOLE SHOW! There are only a few cuts from Hotel California, then a few of the oldies, and suddenly Frey is singing ""Take it Easy"" and saying good night to the crowd!! If they had done that for the crowd in Maryland there would have been violence! Really, when that disc ended I immediately said, aloud, ""Frey... Henley... Azamoff...!!!"" What the you-know-what, you know?! And I wanted the whole show not only because I love this group, but because the OTHER discs were very thorough and detailed, particularly the first one. When the whole experience was over I reflected upon that third disc as almost the equivalent of a bonus track from a CD, which are rarely good. Ya coulda done better, guys!",1377907200,,1336,4.365461847389558

5669311,3,B00BRBIABM,"First let me say, I was so excited about getting this DVD.  I grew up with the Eagles and am a long time fan.  Overall, it is a great summary of how they formed and the changes the band went through.  There are also some really great photos and video clips of the band.  I just adore a lot of their music and LOVE the harmonies.

Of course there is much more interview time with Glenn Frey and Don Henley which I guess is to be expected but I would have liked to hear more from Timothy B. Schmidt and some of the older members like Randy Miesner.

I read the book of Don Felder's last year and expected more details about the friction in the band and what the disagreements were about.  Felder paints Glen F. and Don H. as kind of bullies that pulled some shady stuff from a business perspective.  None of that was really touched on.
At first I was disappointed with the lack of detail on the problems but then I realized that it was the History Of the Eagles and was supposed to be about the band not one of those tabloid-like 'Behind the Music' videos.

I gave it a 3 only because I wanted more interview material from other band member but if you are an Eagles fan, you should get this.",1377734400,2,1189,4.157205240174672

5669322,5,B00BRBIABM,"I purchased this recently and was very excited to receive it and - I was NOT disappointed with this great DVD box set!  This is the best documentary about the Eagles that has been put out, IMO!  I just wish that they would have gone more into the issues with Don Felder (who I miss greatly in the current lineup!  Steuart Smith is NO CLONE of Felder, IMO.  He's just up there, a hired hand, copying (to the best of his ability) Felder's and Leadon's legedary solos.  WE WANT FELDER BACK!!!

One gets the feeling from watching the documentary that both Don Henley & Glenn Frey are just full of themselves - and that turned me off about them in a big way.  Now, Joe Walsh and Randy Meisner are different.  They seem so much more pleasant and easier to get along with if having a conversation with them (yes, I would LOVE to meet Joe Walsh - since I'm a musician, myself, and get the low-down on some of those CRAZY guitar riffs he does!)

All in all?  If I were you, I would NOT pass this up!  Granted, there is some profanity and a little bit of nudity but....DON'T HESITATE TO GET THIS!!!",1377475200,,1088,4.258536585365854

5669325,5,B00BRBIABM,"To start with, I really enjoyed these DVD's, especially the ""77"" concert in 5.1, which is worth the price of this alone.  I'm a huge Eagles fan and I probably have everything they ever recorded in all formats.  The one thing I've noticed in the ""History of the Eagles"" is that Glenn Frey is simply a egotistical bully to put it mildly (watch the DVD before you bitch).  It's his way or the highway.  His hateful attitude shows when he fires these two artist I'm mentioning and his reluctance to get the band together later on.  The hate in his heart is so apparent.  The group was at their best with the high voice of Randy Meisner and lead guitarist Don Felders licks. Think about the Stones playing without Keith Richards or Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page or Fleetwood Mac without Lindsey . . . good . . . but not as good. In no way am I criticizing Walsh, he's incredible but he's not Felder.

I suspect I'll have haters because of this review . . . but I speak the truth.  :)",1377388800,2,980,4.288043478260869

Only flaw for me is the short concert. As others have noted, they should have included the whole show, which is what I expected. Even so, what was included is probably the best of the show.

5669349,4,B00BRBIABM,"As a former fan in the 70's, I followed the California Sound. I also lived in LA. As teenagers, we actually founded where one of the band members lived!

Anyway, I found the ""grown-up adults"" Eagles perspectives take on their history together interesting.  I was sad to see that they got rid of Don Felder and so called, ""cut a deal"" where the two leaders thought it would be fair that they got more money going into their future careers. I guess Glenn and Don had what Keith Richards called, Mick Jagger in his book, ""Life"". ""LSS"", ""Lead Singer Syndrome"".

Kudos to Joe Walsh for getting this life together.

I am also floored that they cut a deal with Walmart, the worst company on the planet. As activists, they should be ashamed of themselves.  Don Henley was quoted as saying, ""they are a getting to be a greener company"".  He lied straight to the camera.  They don't pay their employees well, no benefits and they do not support unions.  All their money goes into lawsuits and if they focused on better issues like the above mentioned things, then they wouldn't be in constant legal brawls. In a documentary about Walmart, it was said that they encourage their employees to go on public assistance. I think that is illegal. I wonder if any of the Eagles actually shop there?

I support Target.

That being said, I think Hotel California is still one of their greatest albums.",1376352000,,1381,4.6

As expected, Joe Walsh stealing the show. Glen Frey coming across as a substantial informal Richard.",1376092800,,265,4.541666666666667
5669354,3,B00BRBIABM,"I am huge Eagles fan and while I will watch anything they release, I was somewhat disappointed in this. Glenn and Don have Basic storys from their youth while other band members have maybe a line or two about their history before joining the band. There are some tidbits that I did not know, especially from Glenn(who else). I enjoyed the clips and behind the scenes that I have never watched before but that is all they were, clips. I was hoping for much more live performances than they gave us, that was my biggest let down.
  Glenn is the most vocal and comes off as aggressive, he was clearly very driven but also in a dark way, he has no reserve about replacing band members and I thought he got what he could out of people who had more talent than him and would cut them loose later on. He speaks rudely about Don Felder and calls him Felder and never by his first name, he talks about Don Felder like he has a mouthful of spoiled milk, at least Don Henley gives him the respect by calling him Mr Felder. Glenn attempts to degrade Mr Fedler subtly when he refers to the guitar tracks that Don Felder would bring them to get a song out of, one of which went on to become Hotel California.
  There is a lot of coverage of Joe Walsh's drug use, some of which is uncomfortable to watch, and while real, there should have been more about the individual members of the band. I recently saw the band live and Bernie is back in, Randy was supposed to return on a limited basis, and Don Felder was not invited at all, which is very unfair and disappointing to fans like me. There was a lot of shouting Where's Felder at the concert and I hope they can reconcile if this is not their last tour, even Pink Floyd did for one set.
  Back on track, I hope this is not the last chapter of The Eagles, this documentary actually leaves more unresolved than it does answer questions. While another album to replace Long Road Out Of Eden is ridiculous, at least a song or two by ALL members would be better fitting.",1376092800,4,2003,4.271767810026385

5669361,5,B00BRBIABM,"As documentary films go this one is exceptionally long at just over 3 hours, but even if you don't know this iconic American rock/country band very well you'll likely find every minute both informative and entertaining. The story is told in flashback by the various band members over the years and is joyous, witty, good-natured and deeply acrimonious by turns.

The narrative is roughly chronological from the band's beginnings as (believe it or not) Linda Ronstadt's backing group, through international success (and excess) in the mid-1970s, to 21st century revival & survival. Music producers, past managers and other professionals from the industry chip in with wry observations and anecdotes about the band and its famous internal tensions, particularly the ill-feeling between on the one side the main songwriters and core members Don Henley and Glenn Frey, and on the other side guitarist Don Felder who in 2001 after 26 years of increasing tensions was `fired' by the other members of the band - the only Eagle to suffer such indignity. Felder initiated a $50million lawsuit as a consequence.

There is plenty of truly great concert footage and fly-on-the-wall detail showing how the band composed its most famous numbers. Joe Walsh in particular shines brightly both as a musician and as a character, and his segments always entertain.

On deciding to `re-form' in 1994 following a 14-year hiatus, most of the band seriously wondered: ""if we go back on the road and book some concert dates, will anyone show up?"" They needn't have worried; their shows continue to attract huge audiences worldwide and younger generations of new fans have become converts in droves.

For the Eagles fan this will of course be essential viewing, but even for the viewer not particularly interested in rock music this film offers a highly entertaining three hours. You may never have bought an album or single by The Eagles in your life, yet will likely be amazed how many of their iconic songs you know and recognise. Theirs was one of the defining sounds of the 1970s and this American music will probably live forever in the hearts of millions.",1376092800,,2137,5.011267605633803

It is so hard to stay quiet, and learn to co exist, but these guys have grown up!  Wow, it is nice to hear them back together, their integration of talent has given us some fantastic music...Love the Eagles, wish them well and hope you will take a peek, then buy the movie for your collection.

Now while the presentation of Don and Glenn is very positive in the DVD as opposed to some of the presentation in Felder's book between the two the balance is great and lets face it, They are pampered egotistical and hard working creative people who arguably impacted the music business and peoples lives as much as the Beatles. i play in a Eagles tribute band (The Long Run-Colorado's tribute to the Eagles) and people are always coming up after the shows and sharing how much that music holds a place in their lives and memories.

Give me a fickin' break! I'm sorry, but if you're going to have nudity, post a warning.

Needless to say, my kids didn't watch the rest. But what was even the point?! It was completely gratuitous, and, as a matter of fact, not even isolated -- there was more later.

I have dozens of classic rock-related titles, and this is the first time I've encountered this sort of thing. Not at all expected.

5669385,5,B00BRBIABM,"I've been an Eagle fan from the very beginning, purchasing their debut album when I was still in high school, and literally wearing out my cassette.  I own every CD and DVD they have released.  I thought this was one of the best rock documentaries ever produced, and certainly the most honest and objective.  Even as a hard core Eagles fan, there was much information here that I had not heard or read before....and they did an excellent job of interspersing their catalogue of songs between the interviews and other aspects of the documentary.  Great to see Jerry Brown, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and JD Souther all offering their perspective in interview snippets.  And though the POV and narrative of Glen Frey and Don Henley dominate-- as it should-- all the other band members (Meisner, Leadon, Felder, Walsh, Schmidt) got to offer their 2-cents worth, and provide their own personal perspective on what transpired.  In the case of Randy and Bernie, it was clear that time had simply run it's course, and each was ready to move on for personal reasons.  As for Don Felder,  based on his final interview snippet on Disc 2 of the documentary, one has to believe he truly regrets his attempt at a power play (which he had to know there was no way he was going to win).

As for the bonus disc of the 1977 live concert, one can only express disappointment in not getting the entire performance.  Having said that, the audio and visual clarity of those 8-songs included was exceptional (as one would expect of anything released by Frey and Henley).  I can hope that at some point in the the not so distant future they go into their archives and release a concert DVD of an early concert performance with the original roster.  With Bernie touring with the band this Summer, perhaps they can release it as a companion disc with a DVD of the current tour.",1374969600,,1856,4.6422018348623855

Here's the problem - I saw the docu on SHOWTIME and got re-obsessed with The Eagles.  The advertising for this says ""4 new hours of never before seen material.""  Let me break this down for you: You are getting the entire 3 hour Showtime docu with NOTHING NEW. The third disc is an 8 song segment of a 77' show.  Had I known this - I would've waited for the price to come down. The docu is brilliant - but I've seen it - the ""new 4 hours"" are the 3 hour docu and the 1 hour concert (this could've easily went on 2 discs - and why in hell not include the entire show????)
BTW - the SOUND on the concert disc is SUPERB and the 8 song set they chose is a nice selection (Hotel CA, New Kid, One of these nights, Take it to the limit, Take it easy, Rocky Mountain Way, Lyin' Eyes, Tequila Sunrise)
but they should've included the whole show or if that WAS the show then include 2 from the era - it seems like they really skimped on extras - and where is our every 5 years or so new EAGLES show on BLU RAY that includes songs from The new CD LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN??  If you haven't seen this and don't have Showtime, this is a bargain at 20 bux.  If you've seen it but are an Eagles completest and want the concert - it is superb and the sound is virtuoso.

5669403,4,B00BRBIABM,"I wish there'd been a separate DVD dealing with each of the songs. What its genesis was, who contributed what, how it all came together. These were the bits of the History that I found most fascinating. The inside scoop, as it were.

Now. As for Henley & Frey and Don Felder...

There's a bit in here where Frey is talking about the audio tape that Felder sent him and Henley. ""Felder sent Henley and I instrumental tapes. Song ideas. 95% of 'em were cluttered with guitar licks, and we would listen to these things and go ""Well, where do ya sing?""
And yet for 'Life in the Fast Lane', Joe Walsh is in the studio, warming up, and Frey hears him play what amounts to a dexterity exercise and says ""What did you play? Play that again!"" And then, after Walsh played it again, Frey says ""That's the lick...that's what we should build the song around.""

Uh... Right.

So which is it, Mr. Frey (and Henley)? Funny how these two don't wax poetic about how Felder had the entire song laid-out (read his book), and moreover, quite dismissively frame what he'd given them. Yet Joe offers up this juicy piece-of-little...and they're euphoric over what 'they' then wrote.

Grace, graciousness and gratitude. Apparently -at least by what the History presents- Frey and Henley were/are lacking in all three.
I get how the acrimonious credit/money issues rather spoiled their view of Felder, but come on; they're effecting revisionist history here. (And elsewhere.)
I'd like to hear Walsh's take on all this...even though he has too much at stake to be that honest. Same for Mr. Schmit.

For the record, I don't think Felder was on as good behaviour throughout as he might have been. But really; there's a difference between people having moments when they rub each other the wrong way...such as, in marriages...and one or more parties in a group simply not having sufficient class to bring about a reasonable solution.

In every situation, someone has to play 'adult'. Unfortunately, in the whole Eagles imbroglio, nobody wanted to step up. Sad, really.",1373760000,8,2039,4.775568181818182

5669406,5,B00BRBIABM,Very informative and enjoyable DVD.  Have always enjoyed the Eagles music but did not know a lot of history behind the group until I watched this DVD.,1373673600,,150,4.555555555555555
5669407,3,B00BRBIABM,"Somebody needs to make a history of the Eagles that isn't an Eagles product.  This was OK, but knowing how it must have been tailored to make the Eagles comfortable with it makes it suspect to me.  I'd like to see a little more of the unvarnished truth.  I can't find anything really critical to say of this production, but I can't find anything exceptionally good that would make me rave about it either.  I guess I can say I was mildly interested as it took me back my youth.  Wow, I can say I saw the Eagles at the Des Moines State Fair ground in 1975 (along with Dan Folgelberg and the Ozark Mountain Daredevils), so they weren't real popular yet.  I was enamoured with One of the These Nights that summer.  Don't remember the concert at all.

BTW, I really didn't like Glenn Frey when I was done watching this, and for him to call himself an actor made me laugh.  I don't honestly believe either Frey or Henley were the great musicians in this band, just the good song writers.  This band really did need Felder and Walsh, and yet they were treated rather badly by the Big Two from my point of view.",1373673600,6,1104,4.2898550724637685

I'd heard rumors over the years of why they were breaking up, getting back together, etc.  I always thought it was Don Henley who was the A__ Hole of the group, but soon found out by watching these CD's it was Glenn Frye.  He seemed to me to be a spoiled, self centered, person who only had his best interest at heart and not the legacy of the Eagles.  Who knew!",1373414400,,517,3.923076923076923

Technically, the quality of this package - picture and sound-wise - is the best the format can offer. The vintage video footage looks really old. And they add weight to the story. And the more recent video footage looks as if they were shot yesterday. The sound - presented in 2 lossless formats (stereo and surround) - is both full and dynamic.

I say that because some reviews I read before I purchased were complaining about Henley and Frey were the star attractions . They do appear in this a lot more then the others but consider there contributions . You got Lennon / McCartney Jagger/ Richards Simon / garfunkel you get the point . Henley / Frey are another song writing duo who deserve to tell there story . Second , yes the live show is kinda short and Henley will prolly release the full show for an absorbed amount and ...... I'm buying it . If your a fan you have hell freezes over and other shows on DVD anyway this is just a glimpse in the past of there shows . Buy it you'll like and feel satisfied that they didn't sugar coat anything ......really !!! N",1373241600,,804,4.160256410256411

While the DVD of the live show in DC in 1977 is very good, it could have been better. For starters, after watching the documentary DVDs one gets the sense that the songs are all out of order. But what is really disappointing is the absence so many of the songs from Hotel California. The title track and ""New Kid in Town"" are the only two songs that made it on the DVD.",1373241600,,472,4.5

As a long time Eagles fan this is worth it for the concert alone, so glad they had a old concert with Randy Meisner on vocals, you can't beat him doing take it to the limit & his harmonys. The History dvd's were great, loved the old interviews! Now they need to make a 3 dvd set like this about Linda Ronstadt with an old concert from the 70's",1372464000,,456,4.134831460674158
5669436,1,B00BRBIABM,"I am a long time fan (35 years) of the Eagles. I have an enormous amount of respect for what they accomplished in the 1971-1980 phase of their career. I am not a fan of the ""oldies tour"" of the past 19 years, or their last album. With that, here are my thoughts:

Positive:
1) The live concert footage from 1977, by itself, makes this DVD worth buying DVD. Great song selection, sound and video. The 1976/77 tour to support Hotel California may be the last time their were really friends.
2) The footage of when they started out in the business was interesting.

Negative (just a sample):
1) Glenn Frey - Too much ego, simply put. He comes across as rude and overly harsh.
2) Don Henley - Boring. He doesn't offer much insight about how the band evolved. I expected more insight from someone with his intelligence.
3) There should have been much more commentary about songwriting process, the incredible era (the 1970s) in which they rose to fame, etc. Instead, it's basically the Don and Glenn show.
4) After all these years, the animosity is still there. I doubt any of them are really friends, or associate with one another outside of the endless touring.
5) I don't think Glenn and Don ever had an appreciation for what Joe Walsh brought to the band. Joe always seems under-utilized in the song writing.
6) The interview excerpts from long time friends (e.g., Bob Seger, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther) are too brief.

Just my thoughts.",1372464000,28,1438,4.609375
5669437,5,B00BRBIABM,When I watched both discs I was pleased to see that all of the former Eagles were interviewed and seemed to be able to be honest about their time with the band. My opinion is that the band isn't really as good since Henley and Frey fired Don Felder who seemed to have a great working relationship with Joe Walsh. The difference is really obvious in the Farewell DVD. This history contains some really good footage of the early Eagles that I hadn't seen before and I have quite a few DVDs of the early performances. I recommend it.,1372464000,17,530,4.363636363636363

From humble beginnings these men lifted themselves to stardom that few success-seekers attain. You will fall in love with the gentleness, the honesty, and the natural humility of Henley, Frey, Walsh, Schmitt, Smith, Crago, Lewis, Thompson, Meisner, the four musicians of the ""Mighty Horns"" as well as talented Felder's inability to understand what is best for - The Eagles..",1372377600,,897,5.1020408163265305

This is not the problem of the Sony Blu-Ray player but a problem with this concert disk itself (now the second time around).
Please advise as to how I can get a workable product. Again, there is no problem with the two History of the Eagles disks. The problem is with the concert disk.

However,the profanity,drug use,and sex in the pre-breakup period made them look like immoral idiots-I had to stop watching it. It is hard to recognize the apparently responsible, intelligent,sober current Eagles in the obscenity-ridden early years. I can't and won't watch it for that reason. I was hoping for some ""repentance"" of sorts, but in the portion I saw there was only rationalization of the behavior because they were young and everyone did it.

5669456,5,B00BRBIABM,"A lot has been written over the years about the Eagles, their fights, partying, break-up in 1980.  Now we get to hear it from the members themselves.  It is nice to hear observations from producers and friends along the way, particularly Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Brown, JD Souther and Bob Seeger as well as Glyn Johns and Bill Szymczyk.  I always loved the Eagles music and especially the work they did with Joe Walsh.  The documentary heavily focuses on the recollections and opinions of Don Henley and Glen Frey.  It would have been nice to hear more from the rest of the band, especially Randy Meisner , Bernie Leadon, Don Felder and Joe Walsh.  After hearing Glen Frey's unapologetic description of Don Felder and his remarks about others in the band, I was left feeling like he doesn't realize the contribution Felder, Meisner, Walsh and Leadon made to the Eagles sound, along with the great songs they brought to the table.  Seems Glen figures he would have been just as successful without them. Enough about Glen Frey!  The Concert disc from the Capitol Centre is great!  Looks like the guy's were really having a good time in 1977.  That's the way I want to remember the Eagles.",1371772800,3,1185,4.70873786407767
5669457,5,B00BRBIABM,"This is a wonderful documentary and offers some great insights into the Eagles as a band as well as the individual members of the band. I enjoyed see both the old and new interviews with the band members and learning how the Eagles began back in California. It was sort of like taking a trip back in time for me to my teenage years and early adulthood because I grew up with the Eagles.
I can never get enough of Eagles and this documentary delivered much more than I expected. There is a lot of inside ""dirt"" on the conflicts within the band as well as conflicts with the people behind the band.  It takes us from the beginnings, their enormous success, the break-up and then getting back together. Very informative, fun, and gratifying to watch.

5669467,5,B00BRBIABM,"Awesome DVD compilation. Always an avid Eagles fan, but still learned a lot about the ""behind the scenes"" stuff. Amazed that so much video was taken throughout the years even before they made it big. Glad to see that aging and maturity brought them back together. Wish there were no problems with Don Felder, but what the heck. Guys plugged in seamlessly. Great music no matter who played or sang. The bonus disc of the 1977 concert at the Capital Centre was superb. Worth the purchase, even if you only watch it once, but I doubt you can do that. Younger fans will enjoy this as yesterdays rockers are truly musicians in the purest form. Something to be influenced by. Don't wait, order one now.",1371427200,,696,4.576

I don't know why but I assumed it would be the whole show.  Nope.  How much would it have cost them to put in the whole show?  I can't see how it would cost them a dime.  Kind of stingy, don't you think?  Other than that it was good.  Very well done.  I'm sure the two ""little kings"" made all the editorial decisions and they seem just as greedy as ever.  Joe is charming, of course.  Even sober he's kind of funny.  I didn't realize quite how acrimonious the tension was with Felder and Leadon and Randy.  Wow!  Pretty ugly and Glen still seems to have all that animosity to this day.  Well, I wasn't there and perhaps it's justified.  ???",1370649600,8,771,4.256944444444445

5669498,2,B00BRBIABM,"This documentary was very well done.  However, it was done by the band themselves so I suspect it's filled with half truths, cover-ups, and lies.  I can get past all of that.  I understand that Don & Glenn want to be seen as Saints of rock-n-roll.  What I can't get past is the promise of a live concert from 1977.  That was not a concert, that was 45 mins. from a 90 min. concert.  We should have been told that it was excerpts from a live concert in 1977.  Because of the fact that part 2 is only an hour long and the ""concert"" was only 44 mins. long there was no need for this to be a 3 disc set.  It would have easily fit on two discs.  When I bought this it was $32.  I paid for that 3rd disc.  We shouldn't be forced to pay for things that are considered a bonus.  I was extremely disappointed that there were only excerpts from the 1977 concert.  Time and time again I'm amazed by the greed of this band.",1370649600,7,911,3.9944444444444445

They split up in July 1980 when I started Med School (those were bad news),  and when they regroup themselves in 1994 was the best news I had on that time.  Now that I am older, You begin to question yourself: why did they split in 1980? Was it because of money? they became greedy? Why the conflict between Glenn with Don Felder? why Randy didn't showup one day and Timothy appeared on scene? How Joe entered in the Eagles? problems with the strong personality of Bernie Leadon? roll of Irvin Azoff in the process and a lot of questions that this video reveals.  I prefered Bluray edition because of video quality though they are of the 70's and further, but if you want, i am sure DVD edition has to be pretty much the same.

Several years ago for mother's day, my son took me to the Eagles concert at Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY.

5669527,5,B00BRBIABM,"I'm in my mid 60s and was desperately trying to finish college, working way way too many hours when the Eagles arrived on the scene.  My life-long love of music was absolutely interrupted for 2-3 years there,  In the 60s I worked as a disk jockey, listening to music 40-50 hours a week, every week.  Then nothing.

 When I discovered the Eagles and some other early 70s bands in about 1975,  I liked them a lot.  I've not gone to many concerts because when I have I've been disappointed with my seats.  I've never felt like I could see the band very well.  When the Eagles reunited for the Hell Freezes Over concert, my high school aged daughter got her hands on a couple of tickets that she (generously) asked if her mother and I wanted.  We were luke warm. Certainly the price was right, but was it worth it to sit behind a post and listen to the concert?  Then we noticed that the tickets were ROW 1.  We went.  Perhaps one of the best evenings of my life!!!

We weren't 12 feet from Don Felder and Joe Walsh.  Watching Felder play the opening licks of Hotel California is hard to put into words. I was awestruck.  I've read a lot about the band since and have built quite an Eagles collection, and their music has a lot of space on my HOT 100 (favorite) playlist.  I had heard about this documentary and was anxious to get it.  And anxious to watch it.

It wasn't easy.  The first three mailings of it from Amazon were defective.  And the fourth one, though it plays, only seems to play when it wants to.  I have been able to watch it, but it wasn't easy.  It is a great great story though and though I got so I wasn't sure I wanted to keep playing the return games, it was worth it.

 All four remaining members are such incredible talents that I could go on and on talking about them.  I had always assumed that both Frey and Henley were equal leaders.  But, from watching this, my sense is that Frey is the heart of the band.  And the three men who came before them were equally great.  I understand Felder can't sing and I understand that he and Frey were a little oil and water, but it is too bad that Frey wasn't able to be more adult and allow the composer of the band's greatest song to stay aboard.  At the same time, I see Felder's prickishness.  Grow up guys.  But, I wasn't there, so who am I to judge, even this much.

  For anybody who has more than a passing interest in the Eagles....this is four hours of great great entertainment.  I'd only suggest that you invest in counseling for your DVD player before you order.  Maybe, with that, you'll not have to invest a month of returning faulty dvds and a good 20 hours TRYING to get the bastards to play.  Good luck.",1370390400,2,2684,4.241584158415842
5669528,2,B00BRBIABM,"Dearest-On-Earth is an Eagles fan (as am I - sort of...well, up thru ""The Long Run,"" anyway...) and she recently paid pretty close to a house payment on a ticket to see the Eagles. ""Aw, Honey,"" she asked, ""Don't you wanna go?""  Be real....that much money to see a band in whom I have but a tepid interest...and in seats that require a pair of binoculars?????  No thanks, and her interest in the Eagles, and my refusal to pay, basically, usury, prompted my purchase of ""History Of...""  And although the DVD is interesting all the way thru, you know that you don't need me to tell you ANY aspect of the Eagles' story.  That said, there are three parts to ""History,"" the first two DVDs being...well, ""history.""

All in all, though, ""History"" just proves three things: 1) Don Henley and - especially! - Glen Frey are and forever will be total, unmitigated jerks; 2) Acquiring Don Felder was - world without end, amen, amen - the absolute very BEST THING the band EVER did; indeed, the movie tries not to display this fact, but Felder was 100% responible for the group's greatest song, the aforementioned ""Hotel California""; and 3) Despite the presence of Steuart Smith, Felder's part-time replacement (and indeed, the cat IS hot as a jumper cable at a redneck funeral - I have a boot of a Cinemax concert he did in 1988, and as much as I love Wynonna, and as shocked and pleasantly impressed as I was by k.d. lang's talent - Smith was RIGHT THERE, 100% of the time) - OK, let me start again: despite Steuart Smith's considerable talent, the Eagles are now, like the touring Rolling Stones and Procol Harum, but mere ""tribute acts.""  Still: the story is told well, and DVD #3 beats spending the month's grocery money on a ""ticket.""
Subsequent comment after looking at this this several times: if there is ANY justice in this world, someone, preferably another musician, will hold G Frey's head under water till he turns the color of a ripe grape.  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for he and pedo-Henley (yeah...they didn't talk about THAT either, did they?) for the 2 creating (sic) ""Eagles Music,"" then birddogging all the royalties therefrom, because (sic) ""he & Henley were the only 2 that had anything on the 'chart' during the vile eighties.""  'scuse me a second there, dudesicle - you think Joe Walsh was ""idle?""  Ringo had him till the iggles reformed.  Tim Schmitt himself on this...thing...describes how busy HE was doing session work.  And how about Don Felder, the genius you bullied out of the group?  Didja hear the soundtrack to a movie, ""Heavy Metal?""  Frey is like any good liberal: he uses the ""truth"" only when it serves his purposes.  YEAH, I'M BILL BOARD AND I SAID IT!  Glen Frey was a jerk and ""History""proves it.",1370304000,2,2832,4.645290581162325

5669565,4,B00BRBIABM,"For overseas buyers I can confirm that the version of this Blu-Ray title obtained from Amazon.com (USA) will not play in a region B (Australia) locked Blu-Ray player & that therefore the discs are all region A as per the mark on the back panel of the cover but luckily for me, I have access to both multi-standard (NTSC, PAL, SECAM) & multi-region equipment for both Blu-Ray & DVD. If you are not in USA or other region A country & don't have such a set-up then you won't be able to play this title if you purchase it from Amazon.com in USA.

This is not the situation for some other Blu-Ray titles such as ""Farewell Live From Melbourne [Blu-Ray] (2004)"" by the Eagles or ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack) (2012)"" which I can confirm are multi-regional. Given that the total price for these 3 titles + shipping comes to about $US86 or $AU90 depending on the exchange rate & that if purchased in Australia the cost would be significantly more (at least $AU120), if the exact same items could be purchased (which they can't), then it's a no brainer when it comes to purchasing titles overseas because of the price difference between items purchased overseas & those bought domestically - we call it ""The Australia Tax"".

The other frustration with buying Australian versions is that for some titles, the actual contents are different. For example, I can only find ""History of the Eagles"" as a 2 disc Blu-Ray version without the third Capital Centre concert disc and you thought it was bad enough that the third disc only contained excerpts from the show. This third disc is apparently only available in Australia in the deluxe DVD version NOT the Blu-Ray. The Australian 3D Blu-Ray version of or ""The Hobbit"" doesn't contain a DVD copy of the movie as it does for the US version.

Anyway, as a musician & long time Eagles admirer, I found the ""History of the Eagles - Parts 1 & 2"" to be enormously informative & am greatly entertained by the 1977 concert footage tho' I agree with others that the whole concert should have been included so they lose a star for region locking & not including the whole concert.",1369785600,,2172,4.651041666666667
5669566,5,B00BRBIABM,"I think this is the most wounderful thing I have bought from Amazon.  I Love it.  Watched it 5 times already.
Service was very good and it arrived in very good condition.",1369785600,,170,4.28125
5669567,5,B00BRBIABM,"I'm giving this Blu-ray ""5 stars,"" just for the included portion of a concert from 1977.  Only eight songs are presented, but they are played so well, that I doubt they weren't ""enhanced"" in the studio.  I don't really care.  It's just so good, especially when Meisner sings ""Take it to the Limit.""

I read ""Heaven and Hell,"" and now I've seen this, which I suppose is the laziest way Frey can get back at Felder.  Judging by the interviews, Bernie Leadon seems to be the most honest one in the bunch.  You can tell he just doesn't care, and he's not trying to slant anything.  Frey, seems up front about some things, but his ego is so gargantuan that he thinks all his boasting is true.  Felder wishes Frey wasn't an arrogant ahole, Henley was careful with what he said, Meisner and Schmidt are barely in it.

The truth seems to be that Frey is an a-hole.  What I gather about the ""Hell Freezes Over"" reunion, is that Felder wanted a fifth of the band, and Frey wanted a greater cut of the profits for himself and Henley.  His reasons seemed to be that the two of them had more successful solo careers since they left the Eagles.  By that reasoning, Henley should have gotten half of everything, then a little bit more for Joe Walsh, third on the list would be Frey, then Felder, and Schmidt in 5th place.  Come on!  If we're gonna divide it up that way, then let's be more precise.  Frey is just an egomaniac.  He was important in the Eagles.  Outside the Eagles, he's just as pointless as Felder.  ""You belong to the City,"" and ""Smuggler's Blues"" do not put him in Henley's league.  No effing way.  And talk about successful outside the Eagles, look at Joe Walsh.

The reason why Frey is full of it is that all members of a band contribute, and money issues will always break them apart if they start trying to measure the impact of each individual member on the group.  The point is this.  The Eagles were a great band before Don Felder (of course that band included Meisner and Leadon who Frey wants to forget ever existed) but they became superstars when Felder submitted ""Hotel California.""  Without that song, the Eagles would NEVER have gotten the fame and money they currently enjoy.  ""Hotel California"" as far as I'm concerned makes Felder a permanent EQUAL member of the Eagles.  But, you know what...Schmidt, Walsh too.  Those guys are up on stage working at every show.  WTF Frey????!?!?!!

It's funny to me, when I hear Frey or Henley say a band is not a democracy, or you can't have five leaders of a band.  Yes that's fine, but you also can't have five drummers.  You never hear this kind of crap coming out of the members of RUSH who respect each other.  I loved it when he remarked on Felder wanting to be the vocalist for a song (I think it was ""Victim of Love"") and Henley said, ""Felder singing Victim of Love, would be like me playing lead guitar on Hotel California.""  I don't get that.  Then, why is Joe Walsh singing ""Pretty Maids All in a Row""?  I love Joe Walsh as a vocalist, and I love that song.  But, Henley's analogy is off.  Walsh doesn't have a pretty voice; not as pretty as Henley's.  But, then who does...besides Meisner?

But, I'm not trying to make this a Felder vs. Frey thing.  I love the music of the Eagles.  All of it.  And, even though there's an obvious slant in the way this documentary is presented, I don't mind.  I love the old interviews, footage, and real history.  Of course, they don't cover much on the musical beginnings of Felder, Meisner, Leadon or Schmidt; hell, they say more about Linda Ronstadt.  But, the live concert from 1977 (as short as it is) is awesome.",1369785600,8,3622,4.429438543247344

5669572,4,B00BRBIABM,"Just watched the three hour documentary on Showtime. Very well done and covers the complete history of the band. Every member is covered in detail, including Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon and Don Felder, as well as many of their collaborators, such as JD Souther and Jackson Browne.

This documentary stayed with me and I think it works best as an abject lesson about the music business, especially as it peaked in the 1970s .By the mid-70's, bands were playing arenas and stadiums, millions of dollars in revenue were being generated. Peace and love, pot and LSD, were replaced by greed, cocaine and indulgence on a new scale. The Eagles epitomized this period of the music business on the highest end of the spectrum. Glenn Frey is the archetype of the new rockstar -- driven, focused and ruthless.  Near the end of the documentary, Irving Azoff, the Eagle's manager, says: ""You can try to be successful in the music business AND have lots of friends, and you will fail."" His point is that those two objectives are mutually exclusive. Glenn Frey could easily be seen as an egotistical jerk, but he made me realize that if you want to be successful in the music business, it is simply what it takes. Somebody has to be in charge, somebody has to make the hard decisions. You don't have to like it, but it is true.

I work in the software industry and Frey reminds me of some of the executives and CEOs I have met. They are tremendously talented across all dimensions of the business, they write code, they can sell, they can do marketing, they understand finance, etc. Really amazing. They are also paid to make hard decisions and would happily throw you under a bus if it was for the good of the business. Of course, the success of the business and their personal success are highly intertwined so it is hard to tell when they are looking out for their own interests versus that of the company. But they aren't paid to be nice guys. Glenn Fey would make a great CEO.

Frey can sing, write, play AND he gets the business side of the music industry. He is also completely honest about what he did.

Lots of great footage from every stage of the band's life, Southern California in the 70's, concert footage, studio footage, in depth interviews with people such as Glyn Johns, David Geffen, Bob Seeger (an early friend of Frey's, who was from Detroit), and many others.

The documentary is in two parts. The first part covers up to 1980 when the band ""broke up."" It is the most interesting in my opinion. Lots of very early footage that you almost certainly have never seen. The glory days of 70's So Cal rock and roll. The second part covers the post break up period, solo careers and eventual reunion. I was never a big fan of Frey or Henley's solo work (plus it was the 80's -- trench coats, shoulder pads, electronic drums). There's footage of Frey guest starring in Miami Vice (groan!). Plus, the reunion became what most successful bands of that era have become -- an endless worldwide tour milking the hits for all the money they can. There is still a little drama to be played out -- Walsh's recovery from substance abuse and the firing of Don Felder. But let's face it, once everybody gets married and sober it is kind of boring.

Here's my assessment of each member of the band based on the documentary (and nothing else, since I never followed the band):

Frey - Charles in charge, either a jerk or super focused and ambitious, you decide. Fired Mesiner, Leadon and Felder. Recognized that Henley was the real star and was happy to let him take that role since it was in the best interest of the band. He is also honest about himself.

Henley - A little sanctimonious, but not bad. Arguably the most overall talented member from a singing, songwriting and musicianship perspective. The fact that his solo career was very successful, especially in comparison to Frey, says a lot about his talent. Probably the most guarded of all the band members. I didn't feel like I got to know him.

Meisner - Very nice guy, super talented, shy, not as ambitious as the others. Doesn't seem to harbor any ill will abut being fired form the band.

Leadon - He just wanted to be a guitar player in a country rock band. Also seems at peace with the way things worked out.

Walsh - The Keith Moon of the Eagles who overcame some serious substance abuse problems and now has his head on straight. There is some very unflattering footage of him post-Eagles break up where he is totally wasted and barely able to play or speak. In my opinion, the most human and interesting member of the band. Kudos to Walsh for letting all that be shown.

Schmidt - Very down to earth, likable, got caught up in the turmoil very late in the band's career. Arguably the most normal. At one point he is being interviewed in his home and he mentions that he had to do the dishes before the crew showed up.

Felder - Awesome guitar player who couldn't reconcile his role in the band -- talented sideman or fully equal partner. Frey saw him as a sideman, Felder felt differently. To Frey's point, he didn't sing and didn't write songs as much as the others. But Frey took a ""my way or the highway"" approach instead of trying to work it out.

Irving Azoff (manager) - Very important player in the saga that kept them all together and looked out for their interests in the cutthroat music biz. Probably the only one on the business side that actually cared about the band.

David Geffen - why the music business sucks, scumbag, leech

5669581,4,B00BRBIABM,"The pacing and priorities of this documentary is a little puzzling.  While the beginning is suitably detailed in the evolution of the band and the first couple albums it starts to lose its way and becomes a discussion of the next quirk, torpedo, or implosion.  They burn up tape on how stoned everyone got at the ""Eagles (Debut Album)"" cover photo shoot and how much fun they had at the ""Desperado"" album cover photo shoot.  The account of the albums ""On the Border"" and ""One of these Nights"" is mostly only a background for the sacking of their first producer and Bernie Leadon.

Astonishingly there is very little coverage of the creative process, only the creative differences.  Arguably their most impactful album, ""Hotel California"", is simply context for the final rift with Randy Meisner and the start of the exit of Don Felder.  Why and how most of the songs were chosen or even how the recording sessions were planned and executed are barely touched.  The larger pop mania of the album and its reach don't come up in any great way.  ""The Long Run"" album is simply described as an ugly recording session that took forever.  Again the genesis of the songs and the reasons for them are almost ignored in favor of a detailed account of how Glenn Frey and Don Felder almost came to blows on stage.

Although every great band has its brain (Henley) and its fire (Frey) it seem the Eagles couldn't handle the same problems that plague all bands any better than anyone else.  Everything from creative input, money envy, performance anxiety, drug use, and even political friction might have been mediated with some negotiation and simple meaningless patronizing but they didn't choose to go that way.  Throughout Henley seemed aware of all the issues but above it all and Frey wanted only to butt heads.

It would have been interesting to see what ended up on the cutting room floor and how it could have been more of an historical account of their first line of business, that of creating and playing music.",1369526400,3,2008,4.702857142857143

Songs like ""Life in the fast lane"". when this inspiration occurred it almost cost one of the members lives. It doesn't say that but you can listen to the song afterwards and think ""WOW"".

5669589,5,B00BRBIABM,As a long time Eagles fan I really enjoyed experancing this DVD.  The film takes you from the beginning of the band through the personnel changes while you listen to their amazing harmonies and music.  It shows the good and the bad that any band has to deal with and it is an in your face look from the inside out of this great band.

5669591,5,B00BRBIABM,I always liked The Eagles music growing up with their awesome line up of talent. I watched this on Showtime three times in the past three days cause it's that awesome. I ordered this here right away cause there are very few bands with this much talent and still going strong today. Every song from Don Henley is an absolute treasure with The Eagles and solo. I love the old footage watching them sing their iconic tunes when they had the long hair seventies look. This gives you so much insight into this band as if you were a member. Glen Frey is an awesome guy and sometimes no nonsense iron hand approach to his band mates seems a little too much but he had to be for the bands growth. I would compare the song writing of Frey/Henley to Lennon/McCartney. My wife and I love every song and it took us back especially I Can't Tell You Why. There is so much to learn from this extensive look into one of the best bands ever.,1368921600,,924,4.255681818181818

5669597,4,B00BRBIABM,"I just finished watching this and it is an awesome, intimate and revealing document on the phenomenon known as The Eagles!! I have been a fan since day one and own every Eagles album on first-issue vinyl, as well as all the CDs. In one part of the biopic they say that people everywhere did something in their lives to an Eagles song, and remember it! That is very true and brings home the fact that there is one glaring omission from this movie . . . ""BEST OF MY LOVE."" I cannot believe that this song was never played, referenced or even mentioned during this over three hour documentary. Wow!! The song that was one of the biggest impacts on my own life, and I am sure that of many, many people. Hard for me to believe, and the one disappointment in this adventure. I would have given it five stars had it not been for this unbelievable omission!

5669601,5,B00BRBIABM,"The content of all 3 DVDs are very interesting to say the least.  However the audio content on the bonus DVD of the live 1977 Hotel California tour was recorded too hot when it was transferred to DVD.  Meaning some TVs, like my 42"" Plasma Panasonic Viera set, could not handle it.  The audio came out very distorted at any volume level.  It was unlistenable.  I had to play the DVD through my audio system, bypassing the TV, for it to be listenable. Someone recorded the audio level too high (too hot) on the DVD (a real audio genius) so some TVs may not be able to handle it without putting some kind of audio attenuator between the DVD player and the TV set.  The other two DVDs, History of Part 1 and 2, are fine as far as the audio is concerned.  If you are a Eagles fan this live concert material from the past is just priceless.

5669606,4,B00BRBIABM,"When I was a child, Glenn Frey was my favorite member of the band EAGLES, because he was the singer of my favorite EAGLES songs... at the time. I guess when I was a child and growing up, Glenn Frey was a child who never has grown into an adult.

According to the autobiography by Don Felder, Glenn Frey and Irving Azoff were the most significant causes for the EAGLES to fracture and break up. After watching this documentary, Irving still comes off as the ""devil"" that he is, but Glenn ends up being the ""only ***hole in the band"" (to use his own quote) that single-handedly destroyed what was once and could have been a truly great rock and roll band. The man is simply a dispicable person without any sense of humanity.

In all fairness, all people join rock bands for different reasons. Some wish to be a part of a group of friends, enjoying life together and making enjoyable music. Some people do it for the fame, sex and off-stage fun. Some people do so for money. And then, some people do so for the purpose of feeding their ego's as their insecurities lead them to points of impoverished self-esteem and self-worth, thus they set out in overcompensation to prove that they are superior. This latter seems to be the basis of Glenn Frey's (and Irving Azoff's) existence as a human being.

His insular personality chased away, Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and Don Felder, and he alienated Don Henley to the point that only guarantees of tens of millions of dollars could force them to work together again. Worse, he cannot admit to any sense of the truth. He was a perpetual liar during the last three years of the EAGLES first tenure, and it appears that he continues to edit the truth of history to fit his singular view of himself.

With that being said, this documentary is as honest as Glenn, Irving and even Don Henley would allow. Don spent his time in the late 70's avoiding questions of tensions and complications within the band and continues to do so throughout their perpetual reunion touring. Bernie, Randy and Don Felder offer their versions of the truth albiet with politeness and congeniality. Glenn Frey falters in every respect, with the only exception being that he finally admitted the truth that he would only accept Irving Azoff's offer to reunite the Eagles as long as he and Don Henley were paid (and treated) with greater monies and benefits than the others.

Lastly, the story of why neither Randy nor Bernie were invited to reunite in 1994 is never discussed in the documentary nor the story of how Glenn attempted to thwart their appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony.

Listening to Don Henley and Glenn Frey tiptoe around the meaning(s) behind the lyrics of HOTEL CALIFORNIA is worth the price of the set in and of itself. To listen to Randy Meisner singing TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT (and snippets of A CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL) also make the documentary well worth the price.

Beyond that, the documentary is very enjoyable. I wish more would have been discussed about how the band created their music... but the inside stories are very enjoyable none-the-less.

It is sad, that the EAGLES wrote about the corruption of mankind, by the evils of greed, ego and the temptations of life, yet obviously the band succumbed to the very perils it preached against. ROLLING STONE magazine and others perpetually decried the EAGLES for their ""intelligence"" and ""preaching"" lyrics, and often criticized the band for being hypocrites for such. In retrospect, the circumspect magazine got it right.

God bless Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner, Don Felder and Joe Walsh (Don Felder certainly described Joe accurately in his memior.)

We have the old records to enjoy whenever we want to re-visit the best days of our youth idealism, for we lost the EAGLES by October of 1976. I am glad that I saw them during the first leg of their 1994 tour, as that was the only period of peace and unity that the band ever shared after Bernie Leadon left.

Had the band been more forthright and sincere in their interviews, this would have been a 5 star documentary (more akin to QUEEN: These Are The Days Of Our Lives) but sadly, the politeness of the various band members (except Glenn) turn this into a glossy magazine story. But, it is worth it to purchase and watch.

Long live the music of the EAGLES.",1368316800,40,4319,4.64613368283093

5669609,5,B00BRBIABM,"No surprise I went straight to the 3rd Blu-ray disc and live Wash D.C performance from '77.  I was surprised how good it was on many levels. First, I've seen the Houston performance of the same year - the only footage of the Hotel California tour up until this package came out. I have a ton of respect for Don Felder but the solo on One of These Nights (it's on youtube), to be kind, didn't go so well. I could be wrong but he looked high on something at varying points during that show, so maybe that was the reason for the less than flawless performance.  If I remember correctly, much of that performance was somewhat sloppy.  Don's  book mentioned the drugs were quite prevalent so it was really nice to see such a professional performance in D.C. - not to mention the Hotel California tour.  He was more or less perfect throughout, which was nice to see.  The whole show was absolutely spot on - vocals, solos, everything.  Secondly, I own a bunch of Blu-ray concerts filmed in more recent years, but this D.C. show from '77 looked and sounded as good as most of those newer shows that I own - hard to believe but true.  Sure, it would have been nice to have an entire concert, but this is the only quality snap shot of the Eagles performing live in that time period, so let's all be grateful for that.  I'm sure the rest of the program will be great and there are already enough reviews of the documentary portion. Buy it.",1368057600,,1429,4.342105263157895

5669611,5,B00BRBIABM,"Having read Marc Eliot's biography of the Eagles and Don Felders biograpy, I was really looking forward to this documentary.  Many of the details were glossed over or left out, as is necessary for a several hour movie, but the inclusion of personal interviews and clips of the Eagles making music resulted in me grinning from ear-to-ear for the entire duration of the first disc.

The 7-song, Hotel California era concert DVD by itself is worth the cost of the 3-disc set.  This was the Eagles at their height with the classic line-up: Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner, Don Felder & Joe Walsh, and it's actually scary how GOOD they were!  In Eliot's book, Glyn Johns is quoted as disliking The Eagles as a rock band and didn't want to record them unti he heard them doing four-part (when there were just four of them) harmonies, to which he exclaimed, ""that is what this band is all about!"".  He was absolutely correct and the concert footage highlights their vocal skills.

5669616,4,B00BRBIABM,"This is an incredible documentary, but a missed opportunity on several levels with this release.  First, the official release should have had extra unseen footage and interviews not seen in the early Showtime release earlier this year.  Give us die hard fans a little bonus for going out and buying the big package.  Second, have some additional ""bonus"" side footage or lost footage not seen in the documentary and not part of the documentary.  We want to see it badly.  This documentary should stand as the ""official"" historical document for the band...make it count.  Finally, the Capital Theatre footage should have been the entire concert.  It is the most amazing footage I have ever seen regarding The Eagles...beautifully shot on film with just the most incredible hi-fi sound imaginable.  This band was so good it was just stupid...they were stupid good!  Give us the entire show for Christ's sake...  This was the band at the zenith of their career.  If you think you know good...you simply don't if you haven't seen this Capital Theatre footage.  They redefine excellence.
Ok, so what they did do right was give us the classic line-up with with Randy Meisner on bass.  What an incredibly underrated musician and singer.  The man played the most incredible bass lines and sang like an angel all whilst locking in with Henley and anchoring the band into a cohesive 747 Jetliner.  Too bad he didn't hold on for just a little longer as the Eagles only lasted three more years.  They were never the same after he left.  You can only replace so many members of a group before you lose the essence and energy of what you once had and what made you special.  The loss of Don Felder is another example.  How can you replace Don Felder?  It simply isn't possible and while the new guy plays the parts...it isn't with the same essence and energy.  The peak of their career was with these five guys: Henley, Frey, Meisner, Felder, Walsh.  After the breakup of this classic line-up, the band self-destructed.  The end.
In a nutshell, give us more vintage material because we will buy it.  Don't wait so long that your audience grows too old and eventually no longer cares!!!",1367712000,126,2170,4.740641711229946

Very interesting perspective on members of the band. Some of the members I would love to meet and others I would never want to meet. Very little on the individual members lives outside the band.. maybe its because they didn't have much of an outside life during that time.

As my brother said...""don't worry, Don Henley will release the FULL concert next year for $29.99"".  Yep...THAT is the ""history"" of the Eagles.",1367539200,7,1985,4.972809667673716
5669626,5,B00BRBIABM,"In Australia parts 1 & 2 were screened on the MTV channel a week ago but I only caught part of it. As the DVD was also released a week ago I bought it yesterday. Disappointed that it came without the third ""concert"" disc I have ordered another through Amazon.

The Eagles have always been my favourite band and their music along with Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac, America and a number of others through that era did paint the pictures and memories that Glen Frey describes in the documentary. But probably none more so than the Eagles with the harmonies that are such an integral part of their songs they linger longest.

Their songbook is filled with so many masterpieces that many don't get mentioned. Notably the ""Last Resort"" that in my opinion could be the theme song for all environment campaigns. Written when young men and before the issue became.... let's say trendy.

As Don Henley once said they wrote above their age and the lyrics in most of their songs show it even in the lesser played ""Best of my love"" ""Thrill is gone"" and those others off the Long Run Album ""The sad cafe"" and ""King of Hollywood""

The harmonies in two of the more mellow Joe Walsh leads ""Pretty Maids All In A Row"" , ""Help Me Through The Night"" along with  ""Tequila Sunrise"", ""Desperado"", ""Lyin Eyes"" and so many others is the ingredient that lifts their great song writing even higher.

If we ask ourselves how many bands can boast as many lead singers and songwriters as the Eagles have and with each able to play more than just one instrument including acoustic how many come close?
The most successful incarnation of that other great super group Fleetwood Mac had three and Stevie didn't play.

The older visual appearance of the original members Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon comes as quite a shock. Age has not been kind to the once good looking Randy and to see a bulked up shaven headed Bernie you would not recognise either without forewarning.

Not to be critical of Timothy B Schmit but to me Randy was the biggest loss of all the former Eagles. It's a pity his ""Hearts on Fire"" wasn't in their songbook it would have been a great fit.
Poached from Poco before Timothy I'm sure if they had a spot for Paul Cotton they would have grabbed him too.

""Take it to the Limit"" was their first number one hit single and relating to Randy we get some other visual with ""Certain Kind of Fool"" and some sound snippets in the background of ""Try to Love Again"".

Don Felder? It appears he now has a lot of regrets.
Many people I think feel that Glen Frey particularly was dictatorial but as Joe Walsh confirms it was always about what was good for the Eagles. Glen Frey was/is undeniably the main driving force in the band and conceded himself to singing less in favour of Don Henley.
Felder for all his talent as a guitar player was not a great singer and his biggest contribution came in Hotel California. As for the ""Victim of Love"" song he felt was his?  To me that was one of their weakest with no flow.

Their reunion work and the later solo inclusions by Henley, Frey and Walsh were still first class although now the creative collaboration has almost disappeared.  ""How Long"" being dragged out of an old closet is an example the newer material doesn't have the same magic.

Listening to the new stuff as you drive down the open highway won't evoke memories like their old songs of the past.

At this stage of their careers for the sake of all that appreciated their older stuff perhaps they could do covers of other Eagles like material such as ""Ventura Highway"".",1367452800,5,3552,4.502332814930016
5669627,5,B00BRBIABM,My Husband and I really enjoyed this video.  The quality of the older footage is great.  This was remastered very well.,1367452800,2,119,4.619047619047619
5669628,5,B00BRBIABM,"I've only watched the 1977 concert so far, but it is absolutely a must have to see/hear them at the peak of their career (pre-reunion). Just hearing the great Randy Meisner doing a live version of ""Take It to the Limit"" is worth the entire price of the set. The sound quality is amazingly good for a concert recording from the 70s. No Eagles fan should not have this in their collection. I would have to agree with the other review that it is disappointing they didn't include the entire concert. Hopefully, someday they will do so.",1367366400,3,532,4.494845360824742
5669629,4,B00BRBIABM,"I've been anxiously awaiting this Blu Ray, as after seeing it on SHOWTIME it really exposes all the angles and many unanswered questions as to what happened to the Eagles in the late 70's and also in particular, Don Felder, which you have to read his book ""Heaven & Hell with the Eagles"" to get the full picture.
That said, there is so much footage from the 70's we've never seen before, one wonders how they kept all this private until now. To see how the story unfolds from day one when Frey and Henley played in a band with Linda Rondstadt and broke off into their own band is simply fascinating... I could write a book on this DVD/BR, but you'll have to buy it for yourself to fully appreciate what the Eagles went through all those years.
The Audio: recorded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is truly outstanding. They really did a great job in using all the surround channels, hence making you feel as though you're in the audience when watching their concert (separate disk that comes with this set), and also anytime their shown playing together on Part-1 & Part-2.
The Video:
For the most part the video looks very good in 1080p, but during certain parts like when they flash back to ""Hell Freezes Over"" and some of Henley and Frey's solo footage the video becomes grainy almost to the point its annoying. Its the disk, not your player or HD tv, as I have an Oppo-BDP-95 Blu ray player and one of Samsung's higher end HD tv's. The graininess is tolerable, but its the only reason I didn't score this 3 disk set with a 5. If you're a audiophile such as I, then this is one for your reference collection.
To see Felder and Walsh playing in their heyday together (especially Hotel California) is truly brilliant. Its so unfortunate Felder and Frey couldn't move past their issues and keep Felder in the band, as he's every bit as much as an Eagle as any of them. Anyway, this is a great story about one of America's greatest, most successful bands of all time, so buy it while you can, as $30 is a small investment for such an outstanding story of how the Eagles gained so much success and fame throughout the world during their 40 years of tremendous success! Definitely one of my favorite bands! I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did.",1367280000,22,2243,4.420289855072464

5669631,5,B00BRBIABM,"I've grown tired and cynical watching the carefully positive documentaries by and about other rock groups, and IMNSHO this is a huge exception.  This is no ""Behind The Music"". Given Don Henley's attitudes about gossip for its own sake, put forth in ""Dirty Laundry"", I didn't expect nor did I want the lowdown on the drugs or the romantic escapades. The documentary is as well produced as any Eagle album and the fact that the band members waited until they are sixty-somethings shows. The early parts of the story give deserved and welcome credit to Jackson Browne (mentoring Glenn Frey) and Bob Seeger (who mentored Don Henley), and to Linda Ronstadt for giving ""Desperado"" and the whole group the push they needed to get out in front of us and begin to be who they became.  Maybe the best indication of how good this is is the calm, reflective, informative participation of Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon and the unfortunate Don Felder.

5669633,4,B00BRBIABM,"I grew up with the Eagles. In fact the only time I ever saw them in concert was in 1972 when they opened for Yes(!) Back then it was the original quartet - Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, and those other two guys. They played a solid mix of country/rock, and their vocal harmonies were awesome. Not to mention the great songs they wrote! But I lost a lot of love when Bernie was obliged to leave so they could get after a harder rock ( read ""lucrative"") sound with Don Felder, and then it was all over for me when Randy was forced out and replaced by the guy from Poco (WTF?) Ever since then the Eagles were turned into a corporation run by Henley and Frey and I don't want anything to do with them. I really don't want to give them any money, but I plan to buy this DVD set because it has interviews with all three former Eagles PLUS an extra DVD of an Eagles concert when Randy was still in the band. I loved that original band; tolerated the addition of Felder and, later, Joe Walsh. I'm sorry money turned the whole thing so big and ugly, but thanks for the memories guys. You were great!
UPDATE: Just got this in the mail today and watched the first disc. It's every bit as good as I had hoped. Fantastic band, fantastic story. I actually learned a lot and gained newfound respect for Glen and Don as artists and, yes, businessmen. They clearly were the nucleus of this band. I guess it was more of a fantasy that The Eagles ( or any band ) were a band of equals ( or ""no sidemen"" as Glen was reported to have said ). It was a wonder that Bernie Leadon lasted as long as he did with those two guys.
Only one complaint: after all the hoopla that the dvd featured interviews with all band members, Randy Meisner was on-screen for only two minutes - total! Bernie was on a bit more than that. But the dvd was meant to highlight Glen and Don, clearly. I was hoping the story would be told by all founding members instead of just the two big shots. I have since learned that nothing on the film went by without the approval of Glen Frey of Irving. So that explains the muted comments by Randy and Bernie!
I was led to believe this ""history"" would be like the one the Beatles did in 1995 - all four of them telling their stories! But in this dvd half of the founding members are portrayed as ""the help"". Bernie was there on the first four out of five hit albums, and Randy was there for ALL five of them! ( I don't count The Long Run as a hit Eagles album. The band peaked and died after Hotel California.)
Finally: the concert  footage on the bonus dvd is EXCELLENT! OMG! It makes me fall in love with the Eagles all over again and forget about the hating and firing and money, etc. It is indeed a great bit of footage which looks and sounds fantastic. And the best song was Randy Meisner singing Take It To The Limit. What a fantastic singer he was! And he hits the high note at the end! Even Glen Frey was all smiles at the piano while Randy belted out his masterpiece.
Enjoyed the hell out of the entire dvd, though I must warn people to take it with a truckload of salt. It is NOT THE history of The Eagles, but only Glen Frey's and Don Henley's approved history. Like most things those two guys touch it is very well done. But it is not the whole story; not by a long shot.",1364342400,14,3276,4.142857142857143
5669634,4,B00BRBIABM,"I first heard this band back in 1972 while in England and immediately fell in love with the catchy melodies and sweet as syrup harmonic vocals.  Having heard the group in England, it led me to believe that this group was English (which of course they weren't).  During that era, there were many non American groups that were influenced by Americana/Southern and The Old West roots music.  To name a few..........Matthew's Southern Comfort and (of course) The Band.

When a band has been around as long as The Eagles, it would be impossible to accurately and completely document them.  There is some validity to the claims of wives and lovers and all of the ""dirt"" being left out, perhaps more of "" this"" and more of ""that"" should have been included to round out and make a more ""honest"" account of the band.

But I think that it's the MUSIC that should be and IS center stage and the DVD(s) capture this very well.

Just my opinion (and your money) but I think $250 is CRaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZY to spend and if you HAVE TO HAVE THIS DVD, ok......$30 is not too bad an amount.

I found this 3 hour history of The Eagles to be informative as well as entertaining.

However in the end.........I think the owner will place this DVD in their library along with other groups of that era such as The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Hendrix, Woodstock etc. and play it every so often.

It helps to be a fan of the Eagles and for that reason...I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  But for the rest of you out there.....perhaps only 3 out of 5 stars.  After the novelty wears off......how often will you play it?  For that matter..........how often do you play the other 60-70s DVDs of the other rock groups in your collection?

I thought so.",1364169600,8,1710,4.456591639871383
5669635,3,B00BRBIABM,"I fell for a similar ""Sales Gimmick"" Amazon pulled when they released the bluray of the Star Trek Reboot. Amazon offered a ""Star Trek Limited Edition Replica Gift Set (Three-Disc + Digital Copy) (Amazon Exclusive)"" for sale. Amazon made it clear that there were only a total of 5,000 pieces they were selling in the Limited Edition Set. Great, I thought! I'll buy one then immediately purchased an additional piece the following day. I opened one of the 2 that I purchased. NO CERTIFICATE ANYWHERE IN THE BOX NOTING WHAT NUMBER OF 5,000 I HAD RECEIVED !!!!! I posted comments about this on Amazon and found others who had purchased this set, wondering the same thing. The set included a nice metal replica of the new Enterprise. With Christmas coming up, I wondered how long it would take for the 5,000 pieces to sell because the price wasn't too outrageous. I thought 5,000 pieces would go fast with the price being reasonable and all the fans out there who would scoop them up. Well, I watched and waited. I kept seeing Amazon selling the set a week after its available shipping date. Amazon was still selling them the next week and the next week. These pieces were being sold from Amazon, not from outside companies or individuals. Christmas came and went and Amazon was STILL SELLING PLENTY OF THESE LIMITED EDITION SETS ! This was 6 weeks after the 5,000 ""Limited Edition"" started being shipped. How can you tell if Amazon is selling a lot more than 5,000 copies if the pieces are not numbered?? You can't. That's the problem. Again, each set sold for a reasonable price (right around $100) for what you received when you're thinking you're going to receive an item that will include a certificate telling you which number of the 5,000 you received. Why Amazon still had pieces left of the 5,000 copies in their warehouse 7-8 weeks after they went on sale (well throughout and after the Christmas Holidays, mind you) had me and several other customers questioning whether we had been ""SUCKERED"" !  BUYERS BEWARE! Unless Amazon is willing to Clearly State that each piece of the 5,000 pieces will include a Numbered Certificate, there's no way to know for sure if Amazon is truly limiting the sale of this item to 5,000. You've been warned by someone who feels like he's been burned by Amazon pulling a similar tactic when I (and many others) bought our ""Limited Edition"". Amazon needs to guarantee each piece will be numbered before they ship even one piece of this product! Feel free to review some of the comments that came up during the Star Trek Limited Edition Gimmick at the Amazon link I am providing. http://www.amazon.com/induvidually-numbered-really-gonna-worth/forum/Fx28S372GYAR5JE/Tx1RTF5BZTETPSV/1/ref=cm_cd_fp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B002HWRZH0",1364083200,12,2770,5.021739130434782

5669639,3,B00BRBIABM,"Before all the how can you review something that is not even released yet bashing begins, let me first off say I watched the 3 hour documentary twice.  While all the live footage and classic era interviews are golden, the 1977 Hotel California concert footage is definitely the cream de la creme.  Secondly, the press release for this has been released.  Everything you saw in the 3 hours will be released with no additional bonus documentatry footage.  Also about 8 tracks from the 1977 concert will be released as a dvd part of this package.  Why not just release the whole darn concert?  I've got a boot of one of the shows filmed during the tour, but the concert footage show in the documenatary is definitely master film...so why not just release the entire concert????  Why only pieces of a show??? It's 2013...why not give the fans the real deal...",1363564800,175,855,4.66
5669640,4,B00BRBIABM,"I first caught this documentary on the Showtime channel in one setting (Parts 1 & 2).  It was originally broken down in 2 parts.  The first part shows the band members in their formative years and ends with their eventual breakup in 1980.  The shorter part 2 deals with their lives afterwards, ending with their Farewell 1 Tour in 2005.  Together the film runs a little over 3 hours.  Certainly for Eagle fans, it is time well spent.  Even if you're not a fan, it chronicles the seeds of a rock band in the 1970's.

The early lives of writing partners Don Henley and Glenn Frey is well detailed including some interesting home videos.  We see an early association with Jackson Browne and a brief time backing up Linda Ronstdat.  We get a no holds barred look at the inner turmoil that comes with the growth of a rock band.  We see the early comings and goings of band members leading up to a bitter breakup with lead guitarist Don Felder.

One thing that comes through is the success of the group has transcended generations like few others.  Their strength comes from some great song writing, often at the hand of Henley and Frey and some of the great 4 or 5 part vocal harmony.  We get some first person detail of booze and drug binges, especially those of Joe Walsh.

So what's missing?  Well, certainly family and wives are tipped toed around and we see virtually nothing of them.  We don't any of the juicy sexy-time stories which are all but ignored.  How about some celebrity union stories?  Still this is an entertaining journey through the lives of one of America's musical treasures.

Available in April, the Blu ray package includes 3 discs in 1080p video resolution with a DTS-HD Master Audio option.  Also included is a photo booklet and hours of new, previously unreleased material.  Also included on the 3rd disc (which I haven't seen) is 1977 concert performances from the Capital Centre in Landover, Md. (Hotel California Tour) including Hotel California, New Kid In Town, Take It To The Limit, One Of These Nights, Lyin' Eyes, Rocky Mountain Way, Best Of My Love and Take It Easy.",1363478400,342,2098,4.616216216216216
5669641,4,B00BRBIABM,"I Love The Eagles music. All of it. Rich in melody, texture, and those harmonies. I have watched The History now (on cable) several times...NOT for the interviews, but because behind the three hours of BIASED History as spoken by self proclaimed Leader of The band-Glenn Frey...the damn music playing is so great you cant skip ahead. Its ALL good music. That's one thing  that survives this incredibly one sided ""history"". It starts off with a very rare home video of Don and Glenn riding in a Limo where an obviously substance enhanced Henley exchange some private moments. This program is filled with never before seen video of the band in rehearsals and live on stage. Unfortunately NO SONG IS COMPLETE. Not ONE. The program runs over 3 hours--they could have left a couple songs UNCUT. It';s frustrating because unlike other bands who regularly appear on talk shows or televised concerts,. The Eagles have always remained a very limited TV exposure band. During their height of popularity , in the last tour 1979-1980 there is NO concert footage. I was told they filmed the 1980 tour-but alas there is no live footage shown. What is here?  Many ultra-rare (kept in someones vault for years) clips.

Glenn Frey, Henley, and ALL The Eagles are interviewed -or rather giving their renditions of how events unfolded. Glenn Frey comes off as being totally candid, honest, brutally comitted to being in charge, making no apologies, and satisfied. OTOH--The Don Henley segments are tight lipped. Henley is always aware of what he speaks and we get no real insight into how they composed songs, The PROCESS of creation. Henley doesnt speak a word about where the songs came from, not a word about his antics with the Eagles partying days. Come on Henley-give us some ""DIRTY LAUNDRY"".  No talk of girls, drugs, bad blood. He's tight lipped as hell. Walsh gives us all he can remember bless his loving soul. Timothy Schmidt doesn't have that much to offer but seems like a very easy going personable guy. Even original members Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner agree to be interviewed as well as JD SOUTHER, JACKSON BROWNE among others.

The STRANGE--DON FELDER actually appears in this show and comes off as a very confused man. Leadon left because the Eagles were leaving Country rock. Randy Miesner left because he just wasn't willing to SING his best composition ""Take it To The Limit"" because he was ""SHY"" (he admits it). If you are not going to sing your best or most famous song--is there really a point to staying in the band? Glenn frey, as arrogant and egocentric as some claim-happens to be RIGHT in almost all of his views on why members were 'let go"".  It seems Felder and Frey were never in tune mentally--Glenn and Henley were the leaders--the main songwriters and singers--Felder had th attitude ""we are all ONE, we should all get paid the same, sing an equal amount of songs and all share the same band revenue"". He seems to be the only one in the band who shares that feeling. What's strange is after being fired a SECOND time in 1999 because Frey claims ""Felder was more concerned about how much money I was making than what he was making"". He called Felders agent and said ""Barry, Im sorry you happen to represent the only A****LE in the band, but either he signs the contract by tonight or we are replacing Don Felder"". Obvously Felder's views that they were all EQUALS doesnt match Frey's view, Henley's view or their manager Irving Azoff.  Watching Felder almos cry admitting he misses those guys-after all of this--is strange. Even stranger--DAVID GEFFEN, Music Mogul, agrees to be interviewed. After all the Bitching between Felder, Frey, Leadon and Frey, -Geffen has the simple minded view that ""Henley has always been a malcontent"". If by malcontent, Mr Geffen means a man who won't have his publishing stolen, his life owned, his song choices chosen, and his media schedule dictated..then I think Henley should proud of the title ""malcontent"".

It is a very engaging documentary with tons of rare and never before seen backstage, on stage and off stage film clips. Still it is lacking in vintage interviews as The Eagles didn't DO any TV interviews back inthe 70's.  Frey and Henley do NOT discuss their lack of participation in interviews, Tv shows. For my part , and I LOVE Henley and respect him as a songwriter and artist-his part of this documentary is most lacking-in everything. He talks a LITTLE bit about HOTEL CALIFORNIA but not from an inspirational point of view. Only from a 'what the song means to many people"" aspect. A lot less revealing than telling us what he was thinking, who inspires the song. Hel, he doesn;t even discuss what specific Hotel he was staying at when he wrote the main lyrics.

 It is Frey who makes this film work--I have gained a great deal of respect for him watching this.  He holds nothing back! He tells it like it is, he's not hiding or insincere.  He seems to be the most level headed, composed,  both artist and businessman. He knew what riffs would make a hit song, reveals where he got the title for ""Life In the fast Lane"" He was the inspiration for their early important hits,  he tried to do what was best as JOE WALSH says ""For the Eagles"". That meant-in one excrutiatingly uncomfortable scene--having Irving Azoff take Felder to dinner (The other Eagles too chicken s..t to tell Felder to his face) to inform him-he will NOT be singing VICTIM OF LOVE_-it will be Henley. Henley has a different memory of the song that Felder claims he wrote. Henley- ""It didn't come to us as one complete song-just a guitar riff, I, Glenn and JD souther constructed the song-we let Mr Felder sing the song, over and over, it just didn't come up to band standards"" . And that is the issue=--Didnt Felder understand--Henley and Frey were always the one's making the decisions. To this day i don't think he gets it. Seeing unrecognizabe versions of Meisner today  and a bald Leadon (his afro was his known trademark)..also strange. But the  music is so great throughout this you won't even pay attention to the infighting interviews. No matter what you think about Frey or Henley it is the amazing catalog of great songs that will always be remembered.  BTW-The Eagles may be the best selling American Band of all time. I'm not sure of that...but Frey and Henley have said so (on 60 minutes).",1363305600,45,6344,4.720614828209765
5669642,5,B00BRBIABM,"Love them or hate them, The Eagles are a band that ran up a string of hits through the seventies that defined much of the decade. They've been accused of being narcissistic, overtly mellow, egotistical, and other things not all that complimentary. ""The History Of The Eagles"" spells all this out in detail, which makes it almost indispensable for fans of the bands or for folks who wonder how a seventies band made it though the music industry.

While the band was centered around the songwriting axis of Glenn Frey and Don Henley, every band member, past and present, gets a say. It's a warts and all approach, often unflattering but frequently compelling. Managers, producers, album cover artists and fellow musicians (Bob Seger, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and more) get their say. The music drives the narrative, sticking closely to the evolution of tha band as they release their consecutive albums, up to the acrimonious split around 1980.

However, the movie is broken into two parts, and the second half details the members as they seek separate careers and the reunion that takes place 14 years later. Again, the footage is not always flattering to the band (Don Felder gets so frustrated that he walks out of one of his segments), but the Eagles get, As Henley puts it, ""that rarest of things in America, a second act."" This covers the period from ""Hell Freezes Over"" to the independently released ""Long Road Out Of Eden."" The whole deal clocks in at 3hrs and 15 mins, making the documentary as exhaustive as can be.

Loaded with plenty of vintage (those seventies haircuts!) and never before seen clips to add to the attitude of the movie. And as you watch these men, now elder statesmen of classic rock, make their case for the importance of the Eagles, you get the feeling that attitude (along with plenty of the big three, sex and drugs and rock and roll) fueled The Eagles through the run that continues to this day.

8573069,5,B00BRBIABM,"Mine was brand new in package. The insert contains portrait of the bands throughout the years.  About this because I couldn't find it on any streaming or  downloading service  after its initial release (on HBO?).  I am a true Eagles fan (have been since high school in the early 90s)  and this documentary  is the true price. All the interviews with the bandmates and their peers and music industry, highlighting of Eagles most popular songs, vintage  photos of their earlier days, and getting to hear their personal stories is such a treasure.  Love love love this documentary!",1528243200,,578,4.88659793814433
