8714528,3,B00UGPM958,"Back when there was a Soviet Union they get together with the Cubans to invade the U.S.A. Unfortunately for them they chose to drop-in on one of the highest points in the world. The commies pick the wrong town to start their invasion. Here we find benevolent but defiant parents and the fiercest set of patriotic teenagers called wolverines; they will attempt to defend and free the country from the dastardly invaders. As we hear every clich and see all the pitfalls, we get to kibitz.

Don't ask if an innovation can take place. It has. Now what are you going to do about it? Relatives shot, friends turned traitor, and outgunned, don't let that stop you.
