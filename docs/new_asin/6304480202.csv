While I only had to wait a few days to receive the video- when it came it looked as though someone at the post office went postal on it with a baseball bat.  It was completely in pieces and obviously not playable.

I emailed the seller and right away received an email back telling me that they were very sorry and all I needed to do was provide the invoice number and they would send another out immediately.  They did.  Exceptional customer service!",1311811200,,623,4.282051282051282
