I would recommend this informative, eye-opening account of the Neshoba murder case to anyone interested in learning more about the intense conflict that defined our country during the 1960's!",1391126400,6,367,5.0
4285522,4,B0047VZS46,"I watched this movie because it is history that I lived through. As a thirteen year old at the time, my teacher 's husband was one of those civil rights workers that died for the rights of all to be allowed to vote. All the time she was in the classroom with us she was
strong; kind, and just a marvellous example of courage. I cried as I viewed this film and I do not think I will ever forget their sacrifice.
An excellent movie to watch...",1390953600,2,441,4.080459770114943
4285523,5,B0047VZS46,"It's shocking as to what happened the James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that warm day in Philadelphia, Mississippi in June 1964.  Despite the beliefs and the loyalities in 1964 for those responsible, those beliefs and loyalties were eventully replaced with truth and acceptance.  When this community faced the facts that some of its members murdered three men in 1964, it allowed this divided community to come together to seek justice for those three murdered men.  This film depicts the unity in Neshoba County today and how some have sought forgiveness for what they and/or their relations did in 1964.  This is also a film that younger Americans would appreciate to understand the lives lost, both Black and White, for the price of freedom, their freedom.",1389139200,,776,5.086614173228346

4285525,5,B0047VZS46,"""Neshoba"" should be required viewing for folks -- especially young ones -- who want to learn about the civil rights movement. This documentary is keenly balanced with the producers going out of their way to give rabid racists their fair share of screen time. I am co-teaching a class on the movement at an inner-city school in Indianapolis. I used ""Neshoba"" as part of a lesson plan. The students were moved by what they saw and asked many questions. They are interviewing local African-Americans who grew up under segregation and the film gives them excellent background on that shameful period. Garret Mathews",1387065600,2,611,5.0
4285526,4,B0047VZS46,"I'm glad this documentary is available for people who have minimal knowledge on Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney and the impact their grisley deaths made on the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1060's.  The documentary provides a feeling for the level of pure, sheer, evil that dominated the south at that time in relation to the way white people treated black people.  However I did not realize when I purchased this that it tells the story on one of the murderers, Edgar Ray Killen instead of delving into the lives and motivations of the heroes of the story.  I'm still looking for that in documentary form.",1368576000,6,609,4.726415094339623

4285528,5,B0047VZS46,"This is not a story in the sense that the DVD Murder in Mississippi is.  Neshoba is more of a review of the case of the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner.  Interviews are conducted with parents and siblings of each of the victims in addition to Edgar Ray Killen, the unrepentant, domestic terrorist, who was convicted of manslaughter in the case.  Jurors, being unable to agree on a conviction of murder since Killen was conveniently at a funeral when the three were killed, settled for a conviction of manslaughter.

Interviews are also conducted with residents of Philadelphia, Mississippi, who would primarily concern themselves with ""moving on"" rather than revisit the case by bringing Killen to trial.  Several feel this way even though they say it was wrong these three individuals were murdered.  Killen denies his role in the case, and portrays himself as a respectable citizen and a retired Baptist preacher.

The DVD contains special features which contain actual trial testimony from two former Ku Klux Klan members in addition to a short film entitled Get On Board of individuals who made a bus trip to Philadelphia, Mississippi, to pay tribute to the three victims in this case.

I would highly recommend you purchase this DVD, but I would further recommend you watch Murder in Mississippi first.  Murder in Mississippi is much better than Mississippi Burning, and it will provide you with familiarity with the case before watching the DVD Neshoba.  Both Murder in Mississippi and Neshoba would be appropriate to show in schools.  The DVD Mississippi Burning contains too much profanity.",1310601600,16,1650,5.096654275092937

One of the best films I've seen that gives insight into the mind-set of men who justify murder based on beliefs of racial superiority and protecting their own way of life.  Chilling because Edgar Ray Killen, the mastermind of the murders of 3 civil rights workers in 1964, still feels justified.  Everyone who wants to understand the continuing toxic nature of the values represented by the Confederate flag should see this film.  The film also shows a courageous group of citizens, Blacks and whites, in the South today who stand up for justice and change.  This powerful film should be seen by everyone, especially young people, so we don't forget that people died for the right to vote and for equal rights for all Americans.",1435968000,,783,4.901515151515151

4285555,5,B0047VZS46,"A great documentary that looks at Neshoba County, Mississippi, from the 1964 murders of the three civil rights workers through the 2005 trial and conviction of Edgar Ray Killen.  I enjoyed hearing the white voices from Neshoba County that are working for forgiveness, for redemption for the attitudes that led to the slaughter of these three young men.  (While the film does not discuss this, it does give us insight into why Ronald Reagan chose the Neshoba County Fair to give a strong states' rights speech during his 1980 campaign as part of a broader Republican effort to brand itself as the party of southern white racists.)",1429574400,,629,4.869158878504673
4285556,5,B0047VZS46,"one of the most culturally significant documentaries in history. utterly heartbreaking but equally inspiring, this film should be shown to middle and high school students, as it contains tons of precious archival footage of the mistreatment of blacks in the south, something all of our children need to see for themselves - the immense damage that racism and bigotry reaps upon society. the real treat however, is the fact that we get to bear witness to a living relic who is the perfect example of the ignorant southern white racist, the unimaginably pathetic Edgar Ray Killen, the former Ku Klux Klan Kleagle who planned the murders of 3 civil rights workers and organized the men who carried out the dastardly deed in the summer of 1964. 40 years later in early 2005, Killen is still free (not for long) and still unfathomably ignorant and self-absorbed, and that ignorance and misplaced pride leads him to give a no-holds-barred interview to the makers of this documentary. he literally cannot hide his pride regarding his involvement in the murders, and even though he claims innocence, he indirectly confesses multiple times to the crime. most importantly though, he gives us unprecedented access into the way that southern white racists thought - and, in Killen's case, STILL think - during the civil rights struggles of the '60's. Killen, simply put, cannot stop himself from revealing his polluted, hate-driven heart and hollow soul, and what a revelation it is! Edgar Ray Killen is MUST-SEE TV. you don't need to read an entire book about segregationists in the south to get an understanding of the issue. a few minutes with Good Ol' Edgar on your TV screen will provide you with enough immensely deep insight into the very definition of racism and ignorance to last you a lifetime.",1429228800,4,1792,4.956810631229236

4285559,5,B0047VZS46,"As a Hispanic and Christian, I felt this type of documentary fosters justice. Not all Americans will experience the events that occurred in Neshoba County, but we can still learn something from this film, namely to not callously look the other way. In addition I was reminded to never stop praying and to never be indifferent towards injustices in my community.",1425513600,,361,4.934426229508197
4285560,1,B0047VZS46,"Neshoba had the possibility of being a great documentary. What it lacked, however, was any semblance of objectivity. From the get-go, we are bombarded with liberal white guilt of all sorts. The Neshoba council that seeks to redress the sins of their towns past do so out of pure emotion. They work themselves up into a frenzy and, laughably, one even cries on camera at her supposed guilt of merely being a citizen of a town that was once racist. She blubbers and carries on and apologizes.

Dont get me wrong- theres plenty to discuss concerning racism and the history of the Civil Rights Movement. But what this film documents is a witch-hunt that seeks to serve-up Edgar Ray Killen as a sacrificial lamb to assuage this collective community white guilt.

Killen MAY have been guilty; I don't know. I wasn't there. What I do know is that the film offered very little discussion of evidence concerning his guilt and what we can see is that Killens conviction was more of a product of politically-charged rhetoric than an actual objective understanding of his guilt.

In short: the film doesnt try to discuss whether Killen is guilty or not; it just simple assumes he is and the viewer is treated to several hours of grandstanding and emotional rhetoric. I would have much preferred an objective discussion of facts and a more-thorough discussion of the history of the Neshoba killings.

Further, this film, at no point, attempts to understand the Southern mindset. I am not defending the Jim Crow South and Im certainly not defending the murders, but the important thing to understand is that the civil rights movement was not simply a pro-black versus anti-black struggle, but an issue of sovereignty. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the well-meaning intentions of the Northern instigators, the fact is that the South angrily reacted to Northern liberals coming from hundreds or thousands of miles away in order to tell the people of the South how to live and what to do.

Again, Im not defending the reaction by Southerners; Im simply stating that the documentary would have been a much more-encompassing discussion if they had at least ATTEMPTED to view the Souths reaction in the 1960s through the socio-political lens of Southerners. Instead, the film starts, continues and ends with a presumption that all who view the film feel the same way as those who made the film and those who blubber on camera for hours, talking about their shame and guilt.

Truly, if I could give this film zero stars, I would. Its that bad. Rent a Michael Moore film- at least that liberal drivel is marketed as such and not as an attempt at substantive discussion.",1425513600,6,2654,4.821978021978022

But by watching movies like this, a movie that covers the reality of situations, one is able to realize that this so called change that occurred through the civil rights movement, is not enough. More action needs to take place and voices of all need to be heard. Not just one race, or two, but all. In the words of MLK ""Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere."" Just because you do not feel like it is so, just because it has not happened in front of you, just because you have not felt the injustice, it does not mean that it is not there. Hear the voices of your fellow HUMAN BEINGS. At the end of it all, that is what we all are. We are just Human Beings, no one is better than the other. My life is just as important as the presidents and same for yours. Thank you Micki Dickoff for this amazing and eye opening film, for simply following your passion of equality.
