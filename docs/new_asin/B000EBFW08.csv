This is a man to man program where fathers speak to new upcoming fathers on how important it is to be a part of their new baby's life.

They show different men from different backgrounds, social classes in life, ages, etc... getting involved with their new babies or, with their young children.  This is an excellent film because there is so much for new moms to prepare them, but not much especially audio/visually for new fathers.  It features men showing and encouraging other men that they are important and needed in the lives of their children...they themselves, not just their financial support.

It shows fathers right in the delivery room as their baby is being born, it shows fathers playing with their children, fathers talking about what becoming a new father did for them, fathers trying to care for their infants, etc... it really is a great program.

 It keeps your attention the whole time and will make a great gift for an already established father, a new father or father to be.

I just wish the program was even longer and that there were more films like it.",1179878400,10,1204,4.619718309859155
