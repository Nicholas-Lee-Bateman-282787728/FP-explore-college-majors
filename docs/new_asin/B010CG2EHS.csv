7307408,4,B010CG2EHS,"Say what you will about the pacing of this suspense thriller, with today's attention deficit affected theater going audience, the slow and steady build up is becoming an endangered art-form. For all of its supposed flaws (and even huge-budget Hollywood films are plagued with flaws aplenty), The Death of April is nonetheless super well executed. One of those ""If I didn't know better, I'd think this was a real documentary"" films on the level of The Blair Witch Project and Lake Mungo.

Katarina Hughes as Meagen Mullen and Adam Lowder, playing her brother Stephen Mullen, are a true power-combo. The dynamic of their brother-sister on-screen relationship is super-organic, down to the tit-for-tat playful annoyances typically shared by siblings. I literally laughed out loud at some of their antics being general goofs and pain in the butts to one another. These are stars in the making, if Hollywood plays its cards right. And they're supported by a strong cast of equal talents.

Travis Peters is genuine and effective as Meagen's father, left feeling powerless to change what has happened, and looking distraught and confounded, but composed for the camera. The same goes for the performance by Stephanie Domini, playing Meagen's mother. The parents come off 100% real, shell-shocked and dismayed. And Stephanie, through body language and speech intonation, even hints at a certain resolve that at the end is actually suggested during the film's epilogue.

Each interview feels real, from the police officer, and the paranormal investigator, down to the psychotherapist. And believe me, I watched every nuance, every blink, and listened carefully to every word.

Mega-kudos to all, from crew to cast, from editor to sound, special effects makeup, music, that writer and director who should be feeling CRAZY proud right now. It's extremely difficult to make a feature film, and even more difficult to make a decent feature film that doesn't completely suck. Especially when you're hustling and grinding for every penny to get it done. Ruben Rodriquez and his crew of talent got it done. And they deserve a hard-earned pat on the back for a decent freshman entry into the world of feature film production!!!",1455408000,5,2210,5.164804469273743
7307409,4,B010CG2EHS,It was a fun move. The cast did a great job. It moved a little slow at points for me but I usually like action movies. It wasn't hard to follow and the end had a interesting twist to it.,1450396800,2,186,3.675
7307410,2,B010CG2EHS,"Weve somewhat moved on a bit from the found footage film and now we are mixing in the fake documentary style to go along with it. Weve seen it done before and probably better, but you still got to at least hand it to this one for trying to be creative when they might not have had the budget to go along with what they wanted to do. So, the best way to get away with being cheap in this movie is by having people film stuff found footage style on cells and other devices, toss in some sit-down interviews and that is the movie we have here. We know heading in something bad happens, we hear the ghostly history around it, and then we sit back and what the events as they unfold. I don't think anyone will mistake these folks for being the smartest characters weve ever seen on-screen, but if we faulted movies for how dumb the characters are wed not have a horror movie safe now would we? Still, it holds you interest enough until the pay-off at the end. Im just not totally sold on that pay-off if I am to be perfectly honest.

So I guess maybe in something like this it isn't the story the movie tells it is just how the story is told and in that regards I think the movie peaks. I wish it perhaps had a better plot for us, but at least they didn't just toss some folks with a camera and go full on Paranormal Activity rip without at least trying to bring something different. Now Id be at fault if I didn't say that Lake Mungo did this style better, but it has been a few years since that and it does feel fresh here, even if the movie as whole isn't as fresh or even as exciting. You still get some nice looking ladies to look at and that always counts for at least some little something doesnt it? If you think the answer to that is NO, then perhaps this one won't be for you after all.",1449705600,2,1791,4.073654390934844
7307411,1,B010CG2EHS,Sorry but this is slow and all talking and a waste of time and money complete garbage,1448496000,2,85,4.0588235294117645
8721987,2,B010CG2EHS,"If you're looking for a fast-paced, jump-scare ghost story, this isn't it. It moves very slowly with just enough paranormal stuff to keep you watching for more. The ""found footage"" was fine. The interviews with ""experts"" were a complete and total joke. Honestly, I started to wonder if they intended for this to be a comedy. I was okay with it until the end. That was unrealistic and sensationalized and although it was foreshadowed earlier in the movie, I still found it the most unbelievable part of the story. Obviously, despite the ""based on a true story"" statement at the beginning, if you watch ALL the way to the end, you will see the ""this is a work of fiction"" disclaimer. And if you look up the name ""Meagan Mullen"" you only find it in relation to this movie. So no, not based on a true story. And that's a good thing, because if the brother was anything like the way he is characterized in this movie, I would have wished that he had died instead of the person who did. He was a total and complete jerk and a narcissist besides. Really hated that character.",1502409600,,1068,4.454081632653061
8721988,2,B010CG2EHS,Lost interest in the first 30 minutes. And why did I watch or should say listen to the end is beyond me. If you like movies like this then watch paranormal activity. And really get the scared of your life.  So what I got out of this movie is  Megan moved to this place murdered the woman that lived there moved in and started to hear and see things and start to act strange and nobody in her family said anything to her.  Then she murder her boyfriend by stabbing him looks in the camera and cut. The only thing that was missing was her turning into a demon at the end. What a rip off of a another movie.,1498608000,,604,4.016666666666667
8721989,3,B010CG2EHS,"Found footage genre isn't my favorite by any means.  Even so, this one is ok.  It isn't great in comparison to others I've seen, but it isn't unwatchable, either.  At least the camera work is smooth and professional.  The story line is well conceived and well delivered.  The actors make it believable.  The main character proves herself as a very competent dramatic actor who can carry a starring role in a full length feature film.  Her performance earns the film three stars instead of two in my opinion.",1491350400,,507,4.693181818181818
8721990,1,B010CG2EHS,This was the worst movie ever made. I want my 85 minutes back.,1490832000,,62,3.8461538461538463
8721991,1,B010CG2EHS,Waste of time,1474761600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8721992,3,B010CG2EHS,it was ok,1469404800,,9,2.3333333333333335
8721993,2,B010CG2EHS,"This is like a Paranormal Activity movie with much less paranormal activity and much more talking. The story builds VERY slowly. Seriously, you could skip the first 15 minutes and miss absolutely nothing.
It is presented as a documentary, where a young woman has gone missing. We are taken back and forth between her self-shot footage and interviews with her friends and family talking about her after her disappearance. I'm being honest and not a troll when I write: The main character is annoying to watch and listen to. Only the most easily frightened will find any of the very scarce ""scary"" parts scary.
On the plus side: this is a good sleeping aide. Twice I fell asleep watching it before I was able to finish it.",1469145600,,720,4.677165354330708
8721994,5,B010CG2EHS,"I loved this movie! I've watched so many ""Paranormal"" flicks on here only to be disappointed time and time again.",1468540800,,113,4.7
8721995,4,B010CG2EHS,"I'm actually only about a third of the way through the movie, but something is really bugging me. I like to watch with subtitles because sometimes I don't quite catch the nuance of what a character is saying and captions are really helpful. The subtitles on this movie, however, are driving me crazy. They keep saying things like ""eerie music"" or some other thing related to a score but I'm pretty sure there is no score for this movie because it's a ""found footage"" flick. At first I thought something was wrong with my speakers and I turned up the volume but then I realized that, nope, no music. I finally decided to just turn off captions but I'm wondering why someone would put music references on a movie with no music. Oh well. As for the movie itself, I'm really enjoying it. It's quite genuine and I can 'willingly suspend my disbelief' and pretend this is an authentic video for the duration. I've had shivers a few times and felt real concern for our protagonist. All the actors are quite convincing and very believable. I can't wait to see how it ends, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be deliciously dramatic.",1468454400,2,1123,4.536945812807882
8721996,5,B010CG2EHS,"I enjoyed a lot of things about this movie, especially the careful development of the main character. In a movie that revolved around her video blogging, her endearing personality came through and she was able to capture and hold my attention, even causing me to sympathize with her situation. I appreciated the discussion surrounding the perceived paranormal activity by different entities (authorities, mental health professionals, etc.), instead of a simple paranormal attribution. And from a media perspective, I enjoyed the commentary on how millennials use modern technology (video blogging/Skype/texting) and what it might indicate about a person. Finally, for those of you craving a good mystery, this film doesn't disappoint, offering an intriguing and thoughtful build-up, pulse-quickening reveal and conclusion that leaves viewers with some lingering questions to mull over and discuss afterward.",1468022400,2,907,5.827067669172933
