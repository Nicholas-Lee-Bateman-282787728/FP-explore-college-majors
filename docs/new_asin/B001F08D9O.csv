3558732,2,B001F08D9O,Picture quality pretty bad... had to keep adjusting color n brightness.  Movie plot was cute and David Niven a delight to watch.,1397692800,,128,4.818181818181818
3558733,5,B001F08D9O,"This is a classic favorite of mine that is not well known. Vera Ellen and David Niven are a great team! The story takes off when a working chorus girl gets out of the personal car of the wealthiest man in town, and rumors fly, leading eventually to a romance between the two. The best part is that while he is investigating her, she thinks he is a reporter, and the misunderstandings continue! Cesar Romero is hilarious as the producer who just can't seem to get his productions to opening night without begging. It can't really be called a musical because there are only a few numbers that have nothing to do with the plot, and I usually skip through them when I watch.",1392768000,,670,4.411290322580645
3558734,3,B001F08D9O,"order came fast, I hoped the quality of the movie would have been better, I know it is not the sellers fault for the quality, that's why I didn't return it, That is why the three stars.",1392681600,,185,4.027027027027027
3558735,4,B001F08D9O,"This is a very enjoyable musical with plenty of good ballet and dance numbers to make Vera Ellen shine.  She and David Niven are quite charming as the principals.  The plot is not extremely original, but the mistaken identity routine is played just right, neither too heavily nor too lightly in my opinion.  The Technicolor is quite lush, but the claim on the box cover that this transfer was make from a ""pristine 35 mm original"" is simply bogus.  Close-ups are satisfactory, but long shots are very blurry.  I'm glad I have this movie, but I really wish someone would find a much better original...or else maybe a better transfer can be engineered.  I feel confident that with the progress of technology we'll someday be able to recover a lot more from these blurry old copies.",1387497600,,779,4.6911764705882355

3558737,5,B001F08D9O,Vera Ellen is one of my favorite actresses. I loved her in White Christmas & any other movie I've found her in. She dances like a dream!,1379721600,,136,4.074074074074074
3558738,4,B001F08D9O,"The plot of this movie involves an American dancer in a stage production company in Scotland who is rumored to be the girlfriend of a millionaire Scotsman.  The movie concentrates on this theme which stars David Niven and Vera Ellen.  Cesar Romero stars as the stage production manager.  The movie has several dance sequences by Vera Ellen and her role is not overshadowed by other stars in most of her other movies.  Her dancing versatility is given a better presentation here than in her other movies, in my opinion.  The video quality of the Critic's Choice DVD version (Amazon stock ID  B000CBEX4Q) has been digitally restored and is very good.  There are portions in the film where the color contrast changes a bit when the scene changes.  But, that might be due to the film's condition.  Overall, the color and sharpness of the movie is very good for a 1950s movie.  The DVD also has an episode starring David Niven in ""Four Star Playhouse - Village in the City"" which is a murder mystery.  The video quality of the TV program which is in Black & White is rather poor.  If you enjoy Vera Ellen movies, this one should be included in your movie list.",1377302400,,1155,4.580487804878048

3558740,3,B001F08D9O,"Vera-Ellen is a very good dancer, this film really shows her great talent its a shame she didn't dance with Cesar Romero who also was a great dancer but rarely danced in films and he was a fine dancer",1361232000,,200,4.153846153846154
3558741,1,B001F08D9O,It look like a good movie. But hoo can see it . I hope if you have otyer tape to sell. Well pore them. ART,1360454400,,106,3.28
3558742,5,B001F08D9O,"I love this movie!  I few of the scenes are a bit over the top, but the rest are so fun.  Vera-Ellen is one of my favorite dancers and her performances include: jazz, ballet, tap all wrapped in the familiar and fun broadway styling.  Both leading characters get a chance to live and love little more than their previously ordinary life.

The colors and music have not been rendered super well, so the quality is lacking a little.  There are places where the whites are blown out, but I am still just happy to have it on dvd.  Its just a warning to more picky buyers.",1359331200,,566,4.2924528301886795
3558743,5,B001F08D9O,I like the tale with the millionaire who is pretending not to be the rich guy so that eventually people won't believe that he is rich - until the very end. It's cute when he wants some simple food and people tell him that a rich guy would never do that and that the rich ALWAYS like caviar.,1354233600,,290,4.017241379310345

3558745,3,B001F08D9O,"This is a review of the Alpha Video Distributors, Inc. DVD; the transfer is not very good.  After the first couple of scenes it seems to improve a little but overall; it is only fair quality.  I can enjoy the music, but without subtitles, I miss a lot of the dialogue; this copy doesn't have subtitles.  The movie of course is great if you like David Niven and Vera Ellen; it has some great Vera Ellen numbers in it.",1348876800,,416,4.2405063291139244
3558746,3,B001F08D9O,"Happy Go Lovely is a delightful romantic comedy.  David Niven is his usual suave and charming self.  The chemistry between him and Vera-Ellen is warm and genuine.  She also demonstrates her terrific talents in a number of dancing scenes.  All worth nothing less than 5 stars.

Unfortunately the DVD transfer (by Alpha Video) is horrid.  The video is coarse and grainy, the colors are washed out and often entirely wrong (but the audio is OK.)  I give 1 star to the quality of the DVD.

The 3 stars of my vote are intended as an overall average between the 1 and 5 stars noted above.",1338249600,,582,4.476190476190476
3558747,1,B001F08D9O,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.,1332374400,,181,4.6875
3558748,3,B001F08D9O,"I love Vera Ellen and enjoy David Niven, and to be honest they carry this film. Apart from them the acting and dancing is poor to average. The picture and sound quality on the (c) GMVS Entertainment copy that I have is bad, comparable to a VHS LP recording. Having said that once I got used to the 10 year old picture quality I quite enjoyed the two stars performances",1328659200,,368,4.271428571428571
3558749,5,B001F08D9O,"I've always enjoyed watching others such as Ann Miller dance, but the dancing by Vera-Ellen in this movie was truly remarkable. She had total control over her slightest motion, appearing effortlessly natural through long and difficult routines. The movie was delightful.  I originally bought this movie because I am a fan of Gordon Jackson, who had a brief support role in it. Vera-Ellen wasn't anyone I have previously enjoyed watching, so her skillful dancing and ""natural"" acting took me totally by surprise, VERY pleasantly.",1315958400,,528,5.285714285714286
3558750,4,B001F08D9O,"This old fashioned musical is just lovely fun and entertainment. Vera Ellen dances beautifully as always and David Niven is fun to watch as the almost boyishly charming love interest.

The plot is as follows: Janet Jones (vera ellen) is late for her practice and hitches a ride with the driver of millionaire B.G. Bruno (niven). All of the other dancers and her director (cesar romero) seem to think that janet is engaged to B.G. bruno and that therefore they will be able to get lots of money from him (as they really have no money) for the show if Janet (after getting fired for being late) gets the lead. Of course true to the genre Janet and Bruno meet and fall in love.

A wonderfully entertaining movie you can watch many times. i didn't give it 5 stars because of the picture quality. With a lot of musicals being remastered i have become spoiled and this looks untouched. Especially the dance scenes where the dancers are mostly wearing white seem to be overly lit, causing loss of definition.",1302134400,,1001,4.58659217877095
3558751,5,B001F08D9O,"After watching WHITE CHRISTMAS on TV recently, I ordered this movie to see more of the gorgeous Vera-Ellen.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this flick much better than expected.  The storyline is very clever and humorous, and the actors did an excellent job, especially the main characters played by Vera-Ellen, David Niven, and Caesar Romero who a dozen years later will be the Joker on the campy TV series BATMAN.  The DVD quality was quite good considering the age of this movie which was probably not made using top grade film.  David Niven was a lucky guy, starring with the beautiful Vera-Ellen and five years later, sharing the big screen with the even hotter Mitzi Gaynor in THE BIRDS AND THE BEES, which I wish was available on DVD.",1296864000,,745,4.707692307692308
3558752,3,B001F08D9O,"The quality on this DVD is pretty poor, but it is watchable.  As a musical the numbers are less than spectacular and they seem mostly plugged into the story.  It is however a pretty good comedy and David Niven gives a nice performance as B.G. Bruno, the millionaire smitten with a chorus girl.  Vera Ellen is okay as the lead and dances very well as usual, but her partners and the score are only okay.  If you watch the movie purely as a comedy you will end up enjoying it though and the price is cheap.",1292284800,,504,4.21875

3558756,2,B001F08D9O,"I recently saw this movie on TV, and thought it would be nice to nave a copy for my collection. Growing up in the 40's and 50's, I had a major teenage crush on Vera-Ellen. Unfortunetly, this is not one of her better films. The basic plot was good, but it was poorly developed; the acting was terrible-even by 1951 standards; Cesar Romero's character was exceedingly irritating; and the choreography was really bad. The state of preservation of the film was not all that good on TV, so I bought the ""Enhanced"" version DVD. The quality was much worse than what was on TV. The color was seriously faded, and there were several places where the film slipped as if it had been spliced. Neither of these problems were present in the TV version.",1250208000,,738,4.514925373134329
3558757,5,B001F08D9O,"Vera-Ellen has fallen off the radar as one of the great film dancers except for the yuletide viewings of White Christmas with Bingo, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney. This is too bad because she was one of the very best and most beautiful. Less musicals were being made when she was in her prime and she didn't get the chance to be in the classics that propelled better known stars. Try ""On the Town"" with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra for one of her best films.

""Happy Go Lovely"" is no classic but it's still a simple and enjoyable experience. Vera-Ellen plays a dancer in a low budget stage show in Scotland who gets the boot from the show for being late for practice. She and her roommate are behind in the rent and dodging the landlady. Through a series of mistaken identities she meets a man who turns out to be a millionaire, the show is saved, they fall in love and all that good stuff. David Niven plays the wealthy man and Cesar Romero is the slimy and less-than-honest show director.

There are lots of different copies of this movie about and most of them are grainy and the color washed out. This one is as good a copy as I have seen. Not great but decent enough to enjoy the charms, talent and beauty of Vera-Ellen. She was special.",1242691200,,1244,4.357758620689655
3558758,5,B001F08D9O,Excellent overall. A litlle slow in starting. Early Technicolor was only fair but good quality film. Vera-Ellen was outstaning and so was David Niven.,1220486400,,150,5.291666666666667

3558760,5,B001F08D9O,"This is such a great old movie, one of David Niven's best in his earlier days of acting.  He plays a great romantic role!",1178409600,,121,4.041666666666667
3558761,4,B001F08D9O,"I love David Niven. He is one of the best comedy actors! I probably would not have bought this one if I had known it has music and dancing, but, I'm glad I did! The screenplay is very clever, and David handles it masterfully! Romero is also good. Interestingly, Diane Hart sounds like Audrey Hepburn. I wonder if Hepburn copied her, or, is that maybe a certain British style. But Hart does a good job as the female star's side kick. If you're a fan of classic comedy, you will like this one, and fast forward thru the boring musical numbers, unless, or course you like that sort of thing.",1177113600,,588,4.3545454545454545
3558762,4,B001F08D9O,"This film is in the public domain and it has resulted in many different DVD issues, all seemingly taken from different originals and resulting in some poor quality DVDs. There's little in the reviews or packaging to assure us of just which ones are the best. However, the DVD by ""Roan Group Archival Entertainment"" appears to be among the best. I'm certainly very well-satisfied with the print and sound quality of mine and, without having seen all of them, I can only assume that it's at least one of the better versions, if not THE best. I'd have no hesitation recommending it.

I just bought the Roan version, and I must say that the picture is GREAT. Beautiful print, gorgeous colors, perfect contrast, and all the details are visible. My only complaint is the sound - low volume, high-frequency-muffled, and sometimes a little ""garbled"". I also have a 1-dollar DVD of this movie with washed-out picture and weak colors - like other people here describe the Alpha version - but the sound on THAT one is very good!. If only we could take the soundtrack from the cheapie and marry it to the picture from the Roan, we'd have a first-rate DVD!",1149811200,,712,4.6141732283464565
3558764,4,B001F08D9O,"HAPPY GO LOVELY is a charming musical, filmed in England and set against the backdrop of the Edinburgh Festival.  Vera-Ellen, considered the greatest female dancer of her generation (and the best dancer to have been employed at MGM) plays Janet Jones, a young corps dancer in a new musical called ""Frolics to You"".  Thanks to a case of jumping to the wrong conclusion, director Frost (Cesar Romero) believes Janet is the girlfriend of millionaire B.G. Bruno (David Niven).  Frost decides to get B.G. to bankroll the musical and put Janet in the starring role.  Comedic situations ensue before Janet and B.G. really find love in the final reel.

Fans of musicals (and in particular fans of the magnificent Vera-Ellen) will find HAPPY GO LOVELY a wonderful movie experience.  Vera-Ellen is showcased in several musical numbers where she displays her unique combination of balletic grace, athleticism and coquettish charm.  David Niven and Cesar Romero are great and the supporting cast features top British actors (Gordon Jackson, Bobby Howes and Joyce Carey to name three, but it's fun trying to spot others).

Alpha's DVD includes a decent print, perhaps a bit too bright and overexposed at times, but still very watchable",1145404800,,1222,5.105527638190955
3558765,4,B001F08D9O,"Happy-Go-Lovely (1951) is a bright, breezy backstage musical which takes place at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.

A chorus girl in a musical revue (Vera-Ellen) thumbs a ride in a limo belonging to a Scottish millionaire, leading to rumors of an affair even though they haven't met. Hoping for an investment, the amusingly unscrupulous producer of the show (Cesar Romero) elevates her from chorine to the lead. When the millionaire (David Niven) comes to the theater to investigate, he is mistaken for a reporter, and Vera-Ellen promptly falls in love with him.

Don't be fooled. This movie plays much better than the plot would suggest, providing a delightful piece of comfort food with excellent performances and entertaining musical numbers.

David Niven, playing a true ""romantic"" lead, is more charming than I have ever seen him before. Vera-Ellen, also charming and funny, dances beautifully and, playing one of her only undisputed female musical leads, carries the picture in excellent style. Cesar Romero is in his element as the comical producer/director, and, with the help of a fine supporting cast, provides zany, and surprisingly tasteful, fun.

Another highlight is the score by Mischa Spoliansky, which really gives the film its musical comedy feel, leaving one with the impression of much music and dancing despite the film having only four musical numbers.

The Roan Group DVD transfer of ""Happy-Go-Lovely"" is worth the extra money; in fact, it is the best print I have yet seen of this film. The colors are bright, the picture is reasonably sharp and clear, and, although it would benefit from further picture and sound restoration, the film overall is in pretty good shape.
