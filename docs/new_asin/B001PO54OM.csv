3752680,5,B001PO54OM,"these four movies help define a generation of westerns created by some of the best directors in the business.  the searchers, arguably one of the best films ever made, is truly a study in the human condition. the story is told through an image that, together with the amazing scenery, is unforgetable.
these movies are recommended without reservation.",1244505600,10,351,5.051724137931035

3752720,5,B001PO54OM,"Rio Bravo is one of the few modern westerns with singing. Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin provide some music to make up for the terrible role Angie Dickenson plays. The plot of this movie was used again in El Dorado, a western with John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The bad guy hires gun hands to get his way. The brave little group of law enforcement fights them off even though the sheriff is a drunk and still in withdrawal. The magnificent array of stars make even this weak plot a good movie. You can watch it over and over.
The Searchers has never enjoyed the box office success of John Wayne's other movies but it is probably one of his best. He plays a hard man in a time that was hard on people. He must search for his neice who has been kidnapped by natives.
Fort Apache is one of the old shoot 'em up, cowboys and indians movies. Very little plot but lots of shooting. Great movie.
The Cowboys is about a rancher who has to get his cattle to market and the only option he has is to hire a bunch of school kids to herd them to market. The dangers, the laughs and the sadness of the trail make men out of a loose gaggle of boys.",1476835200,,1131,4.122171945701357

3752764,5,B001PO54OM,"Each movie is on a separate disk. All four DVDs are stacked on one spindle, and it would have been nice if they were separated. That said, it's not that inconvenient and not a deal-breaker.

The biggest plus in this collection is that the movies are on separate discs. I hate two-sided disks, both for longevity reasons and trying to read the minute print around the hub. (Which I've finally solved by printing my own hub labels, but really, separate DVDs are much better!)

All these movies have closed captions or subtitles, which is an important factor.",1454716800,4,556,4.721649484536083

I have been trying to replace many of our VHS tapes with DVDs, so I decided to start with the husbands stuff because most of my movies are already DVDs and he has a lot more VHS than I do.  I thought it would be nice to give him these for Christmas this year because he is a bit hard to buy for, he already has enough clothes and such and tools, etc.  So I figured this is what I would do this year.  By buying some of the DVDs with several movies on them, I have already been able to replace all of his John Wayne Collection and then some.

3752860,4,B001PO54OM,"This would have had 5 stars. John Wayne will get 31/2 just because but the product itself earns another half for quality. It suffers only that the print on the discs is so small you need a magnifyer to read it. The case is a little flimsy as well. Good for 1 disc not 2. I enjoyed the bonus material with ""The Cowboys"". Interviews with Dern, Brown other cast members and that liberal pantywaist director who after 35 years still can't give credit where due without snide and demeaning remarks about JW snuck in with the disingenuous praise. If you could have only one collection of John Wayne this is the one I'd recommend. His best, ""The Searchers""; one of his most fun, ""Rio Bravo"" and a bunch of great supporting actors- Jeffry Hunter-Walter Brennen - Angie Dickenson - Natalie Wood - Henry Fonda - even an almost grown-up Shirley Temple and the never-will-grow-up Dean Martin who proves he's as good an actor as he is a singer. In this one he sings with Ricky Nelson. The ""Boys"" in ""The Cowboys"" including Robert Carradine and A Martinez turn out to be surprisingly good actors and real cowboys as you will see in the bonus materials.",1426204800,,1138,4.556097560975609

3752902,4,B001PO54OM,"I bought this collection for a friend.  I have two of the films and two I haven't seen.  ""The Searchers""  is thought by several critics to be the best western ever made.  It appears on the best American films lists in England and France.  A young child is kidnapped by a band of Comanches on a raid who them kill her parents.  Her uncle (Wayne) a Confederate veteran and her adopted brother (a young Jeffrey Hunter) set out to find her.  Their search lasts more than five years.  There is a growing tension between Wayne and Hunter's characters, as Hunter is afraid that Wayne will kill the girl,now 15 years old (Natalie Wood) if they find her.  to her uncle, she is no longer white but "" a Comanch""  The supporting case includes Ward Bond, Vera Miles, Ken Curtis, Harry Carey Jr., Pippa Schott, and Chief Thundercloud.  The director was John Ford.
  ""Rio Bravo"" is lighter by comparison, but it has all the classic western personnel and action  John Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance.  His deputies are Dude (Dean Martin), a recovering alcoholic; Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson) a young gunfighter working for Chance's old friend Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond); and stumpy (Walter Brennan).  The sheriff locks up Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) for a bar shooting which was clearly murder.  But the town is soon bottled up by Joe's older brother, a wealthy rancher (John Russell).  Complicating the matter for John T. is Feathers (Angie Dickinson), a woman gambler who find herself growing attracted to the sheriff, who is developing feelings also.  Look for a cameo appearance by one of the original cowboy heroes - Bob Steele.
  The film was directed by Howard Hawks.
  ""The Cowboys"" stars an older John Wayne as a cattle rancher who is forced to hire a group of young boys to help drive his herd to market.  As for ""Fort Apache"", any time you get John Wayne and Henry Fonda in the same movie, it has to be worth the price of admission.",1419811200,,1924,4.624260355029586

In addition, my enjoyment of movies is enhanced by the provision of subtitles and these include that feature for those of us whose hearing is not as acute as it once was.

These movies are on four separate discs and were available at a sale price of $9.96 when I made the purchase and I notice that they are still available at that price. This is definitely a bargain which John Wayne fans should not pass up. Highly recommended.",1409616000,7,649,4.538461538461538

""The Rescuers"" is directed by John Ford and  features the background of Monument Valley.  There is the surprise of a very young Natalie Wood toward the end of the movie and also stars a young Jeffrey Hunter.  My dad use to take us to see a (western) movie every Friday night when I was growing up, and John Wayne was/is the best.  The American West is what America looked like when my father came here in 1918.  It shows me the hardships our forefathers had to overcome, and it's a measure of how much progress America in a short 100 years.  From the covered wagon to the moon and beyond.",1390176000,,677,4.283464566929134
3753003,5,B001PO54OM,"All my life I have been an enthusiastic fan of westerns and like many people, one of my all time favorites actors is John Wayne, who I think was born to play the American cowboy.  It is rare when you find a movie set collection which has all the films as classics.  This set is absolutely fantastic because it has ""the Cowboys"" which is about John Wayne supervising a group of very young cowboys on a cattle drive.  The second one, "" For Apache"" is also a classic with John Wayne as a Calvary officer along with Henry Fonda.

The third movie is also one of my favorite movies. Rio Bravo stars John Wayne, Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin.  The final selection is a true classic western which is one of the best movies of all time starring John Wayne who just got back from fighting in the civil war and winds up searching many years for his kidnapped niece who had been captured by the Indians when she was a small child.

If you are a true western fan who does not have this 4-western movie classic set, you may want to check it out.  Personally, I love this John Wayne classic DVD set and I  have enjoyed watching  it many times over the years.

I originally figured to purchase The Searchers only, but when I came upon this collection, I knew I had heard of ""The Cowboys"" and really wanted to see it, too.  Both movies blew me away.  The Searchers clearly influenced The Outlaw Jose Wales and Unforgiven.  A real classic in the genre.  The Cowboys gave a look at an aging Duke and Bruce Dern gives his most sinister performance and by that, I do mean sinister.  Fort Apache shows another side to the Duke as he is not in charge.  Henry Fonda probably should not have been in charge as we see later on, but the Duke does play second fiddle and he does it well.  And of course, Rio Bravo is the ultimate John Wayne western.

The Searchers are all good movies, and my son in law Dennis will enjoy himself some evening when nothing good is on the Direct TV, he can play a good movie for entertainment.  Who couldn't be entertained by John Wayne?  Just knowing he is in the movies is enough to turn the movie on to sit and enjoy the West.  I now live in the West and am sure that he loved it as I do.  So we live the story thru someone elses acting and enjoy ourselves and become a part of that beautiful sunset and his riding off on his horse.  Thanks Amazon.com for the best set of four.

""The Searchers"" contained a commentary track from Peter Bogdanovich along with an intro by Patrick Wayne. All of the films contained the original trailer.

I'm not so much looking for reviews of the movies, the plot lines, or the actors.  I'm looking for information about the technical quality of the DVD production; is it a quality copy or a bad dub; is the video and sound good or poor; are there worthy extras like scene selection or directors comments.  I recently discovered the issue with regions and having the appropriate DVD player by reading these reviews.

In this particular instance, the video and sound quality is good; these seem to be good copies of the original movies; no extras.  My only issue is the extra small print on the DVD ring labeling the movie titles.  My eyes aren't as good as they used to be.  Because the DVD's are double-sided there's no big label or graphics to identify them, just the very small center ring.

3753340,5,B001PO54OM,"Can a person go wrong with a classic JW western? How about 4 of them in one pack then!!! What a great buy for these essential JW movies.

With ""The Searchers,"" John Wayne turns in a haunting memorable performance as Ethan Edwards, a man returned from the war. After his family is slaughtered by Natives, he sets out to find the capturers of his niece. What ensues is one of the finest performances of his career. This movie has a somber tone, but there are a few laughs thrown in here and there. A must watch.

1972's ""The Cowboys"" shows Wayne as a rancher that needs to find some hired hands to move his cattle. Because of the lack of man power, he enlists a group of young boys and turns them from greenhorns into full fledged drovers. Another fine performance from Wayne, and one of his most touching westerns.

I have to say that although ""Rio Bravo"" has a stellar cast with JW, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson, I still prefer ""El Dorado"" (which is essentially the very same movie, but with Robert Mitchum in place of Deano, and James Caan in the Ricky Nelson role). Rio Bravo is an excellent movie in its own right, with several memorable one liners like ""Sorry don't get it done, Dude. Don't ever do that again."" This was voted as the #1 western of all time by ""American Cowboy"" magazine.

3753341,5,B001PO54OM,"What can I say about John Wayne that hasn't been said?  I'm a big fan and have copies of most of his movies.  These old ones bring back memories because at age 71, I watched most of them in theaters in my younger years.  The contrast between these old films and the stuff of Hollywood these days is something to consider.  Personally, I prefer the oldies that run at a slower pace, have only a little violence, no profanity and are just plain, family entertainment.",1294790400,,465,4.435294117647059
