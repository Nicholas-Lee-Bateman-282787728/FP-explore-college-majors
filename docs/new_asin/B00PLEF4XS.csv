6815994,5,B00PLEF4XS,"Call it for what it is....It's not the book. It tries to be, but then it knows it can't. It's impossible to adapt the book to a trilogy. Should have been made into a TV Miniseries. Still hope they do.

But, it gets the concepts of a free and open market across and shows the dire consequences of endless government intrusion time and time again until it's too late.",1418947200,9,365,4.2898550724637685
6815995,5,B00PLEF4XS,"I saw Atlas Shrugged part 3 eight times in the theater.  It is wonderful.  Galt's conversation with Mr. Thompson is worth the price of admission.  So is Dr. Akston's chat with Dagny.  So is....oh, there are so many great scenes.  For an hour and a half (which seems like 30 minutes) you can forget the insanity of Obama and live in a world where heroes live.
  To the people who think they could have done it better, I ask, why didn't you?  Why didn't you pony up the million dollars for the movie rights and do it your way?  Oh, your favorite scene was left out?  Well, so were some of mine, but how long would you like a thousand-page-book movie to be?  Galt's speech takes 90 minutes to read. That would take up the whole movie.  If you love freedom and you didn't love this movie, well, then, that's a contradiction you'll just have to figure out.  God bless John Aglioloro and everyone at Atlas.  Thank you and Merry Christmas.",1418860800,73,932,4.374269005847953
6815996,1,B00PLEF4XS,"I didn't think it could be possible to make one worse than #2, and thought that one worse than the first, which was no better than the worst TV serial in prime time.

6815997,1,B00PLEF4XS,"Because of our admiration for the book, the philosophy, and the author my wife and I made it a special occasion to see AS3 in the cinema.  As a consequence, we choose to recall it most pleasantly.  We are therefore in no particular hurry to have this fond memory disturbed the the reality of how poorly AS3 was scripted, cast, or shot.

6816000,1,B00PLEF4XS,Maybe they could get a government grant and get this trilogy finished up proper ? I mean Ayn was on some kind of welfare at the end anyway. Seems fitting,1417651200,3,153,4.133333333333334
6816001,1,B00PLEF4XS,"If you read my reviews of the first two movies, you'll see I thought they were OK.  I enjoyed them enough that I actually saw part three in the theater instead of waiting for Netflix (that wasn't easy to do, by the way).  While the first two were neither memorably good nor bad, this gem is *so* horrible that it's kind of entertaining to watch for...well, you know who you are.  Don't worry if you didn't see the first two; you can catch up pretty quickly.

You know right from the beginning that this is a whole different beast than the first two movies.  It starts with really cheesy narration in which they tell you, among other things, exactly who John Galt is, so there's some question about whether you really need to hang around for the rest. The narrator sounds a *lot* like Bill Kurtis when he narrated Anchorman, which really detracts from the gravitas they were shooting for, right out of the gate.

The first actual scene picks up precisely where part 2 left off, which makes this complete cast change (you knew about that, right?) even more jarring than the last complete cast change.  Most of the key characters crowd around, and (almost literally) trip over each other to bring Dagny up to speed and babble on about...put it this way, remember that guy in college who just discovered Ayn Rand and wouldn't shut up about it? Yeah, it's like that.  This comes in such a torrent that pretty much everything they're ""trying to say"" is said in the first 10 minutes, and the rest of the movie is basically just repetition, philosophy-wise.

Some of their new casting choices are really bizarre. Francisco is now clearly old enough to be Dagny's father, making their previous relationship really creepy, and possibly illegal. I really like Rob Morrow, but it struck me as comical miscasting to have him play Hank Rearden, so I was really curious to see how that worked out. Unfortunately, they cut him almost entirely out, having him only appear briefly in some of the narrated montages, with no speaking parts.  I'm reasonably certain this must be the least screen time that ever earned someone ""star"" billing in a full length movie.

Miscasting aside, most of the new actors do the best with what they've been given. I really liked Mark Moses (Desperate Housewives) as Midas Mulligan. Kristoffer Polaha looks more like a front man for a grunge band than the chiseled Adonis I was expecting, but in spite of that, he actually does a pretty good job as John Galt. In fact, he gives him significantly more personality than the book's character has. His facial expressions even hint at - Rand forbid! - a sense of humor. Unfortunately, the script is so laughably bad that good acting just can't save it.

As for the rest, the movie screams low budget at every turn. They saved money by filming much of it outdoors and in national parks - specifically Sequoia National Park! I don't mean that you occasionally catch a glimpse of a sequoia, I mean they rely heavily on them, even driving through the famous tunnel in the fallen tree - twice - just to remind you were it was really filmed. I honestly think Aglialoro doesn't realize there are no sequoias in Colorado.

Don't get me wrong, these extended nature travelogues are beautifully filmed, and definitely the highlight of the movie, but the fact that an Ayn Rand movie relies so heavily on national parks is an irony that can only be lost on her true believers. These are juxtaposed with grim scenes of industrial decay, so if you watched the movie with the sound off, you'd walk away thinking that the message is that the government really needs to protect wilderness from the ravages of exactly the sort of people Rand is championing. Seriously, if she had her way, those beautiful trees would have been logged decades ago.

The parts that aren't in the woods are comically cheap. Large, important sections are narrated over montages, which include stills and even stock footage. The sets and props they do use come straight from the Ed Wood school of film making.  For example, a ""TV studio"" appears to be a high school gym with black curtains hiding the walls and basketball hoops. I literally laughed out loud when the sinister ""Project F"" was unveiled, which did not endear me to the handful of other people in the theater.

I'm assuming that everyone who sees this movie has read the book, which is good because there are some really glaring plot holes that wouldn't make sense otherwise.  Really, leaving so many loose ends even *with* extensive narration is just laziness, pure and simple.

So Aglialoro has achieved his life's ambition, and this bizarre footnote in cinematic history has come unceremoniously to an end.  The first two parts will soon be forgotten, but this at least has the potential to gain something of a cult following.  I know *I'll* watch it again.",1417478400,45,4841,4.706508875739645

Rand thought in terms of inferior intellects attacking superior intellects (such as herself). To really buy into this move, you have to think more in modern terms, i.e., mindless over-regulation as a way of life.",1525132800,,375,5.372881355932203

6816017,1,B00PLEF4XS,"OMG...what an absolutely sloppy and terrible final ending to this trilogy.  Actors changed...important ones too, not just the fillers.  Hank Reardon basically disappeared with a 5 second phone call to the woman he's been looking for loyally for a month...and all we hear is, ""Yeah, glad you're alive...well, gotta' go, I'm heading to San Diego, bye!""  What happened here?  Sloppy.  Dagny's sister-in-law (different actress) just disappears, no drama etc....just gone and a flashback.  Galt's Gulch turns into a commune and is squishy.  The ending...felt like the Ewok Star Wars...with the SSI thugs etc. being a joke and Dagny, with no experience, becomes a ninja leading the pack, shoots a pathetic guard with barely a notice and then is on point to rescue Galt...what is happening here. No guards to make sure Galt isn't rescued etc. etc. etc.  A major who care about these people, what happened to the strengths in I & II?  It was a terrible and lazy effort, no wonder the original actors didn't show up, nothing to see here.

6816019,4,B00PLEF4XS,"So I'm not going to review the actual movie here although to briefly mention that it's not quite as good as part 2.  As far as the disc itself the video quality is actually really really good, you can see some textures in some of the scenes.  It looks as though it doesn't really have any noise, maybe because they filmed on high-def video, although I'm not sure.  The audio leaves a little something to be desired, considering a large portion of this movie concerns actually talking.  I had to keep turning up the volume to hear them, and then it would blast out when it was loud.  It's got the requisite special features so overall as far as a release goes is good.",1519776000,,667,4.346774193548387

6816035,5,B00PLEF4XS,"The trilogy gets 5 stars for content and message.  To say that the series is a cinematic masterpiece would be false.  The changing cast is, unfortunately, not something which can be overlooked if you are simply watching the movies for their own value alone.  The truth, however, is that those loyal to the works of Ayn Rand - those of us who have already read the sweeping, 1,000+ page Atlas Shrugged, know that no movie, no matter how well done, could do true justice to the book.

I watch them in one sitting, and the more I watch, the better they become because my own visualization has begun merging with the movies.

6816069,4,B00PLEF4XS,"Watched Atlas Shrugged III Blu-ray and thought it was great in it's discussion of pro-Conservative Politics.  Ayn Rand was way ahead of her time when she wrote the book from which this series was adapted!  It was amazing the producers were able to get all three movies made considering Hollyweird is so Liberal, and from the producers' standpoint this series was pro-Conservative!  In fact III was funded by a Kickstarter campaign from what I understand.

I like the actors in this version, especially Laura Regan, who played the female lead, Dagny Taggart, who was much prettier than Samantha Mathis, who played Taggart in II.

The main problem with the series was the constant shuffling of the actors in each movie.  I suppose it was due to budgetary problems, which made this seemed like a made for TV movie series instead of a full Hollywood production?  Or perhaps it was hard to get money or A list actors due to the series' Conservative viewpoint?  Either way despite of lack in production costs the well acted and pro-Conservative plot made up for it in spades!  An excellent example of what happens to the world under too much government control and Globalist politics!",1493424000,5,1178,4.85

What subtlety there was in the novel? Gone. What philosophy was in the novel? Potemkin version of it is here.

If this were a made-for-tv movie, it wouldn't even get the 2AM time slot.

I can't imagine the obstacles that the makers of these three films faced.  Rand's book is very long and detailed--to do it justice it would require twice as much screen time as was practical.  However, I look at these films as merely an introduction to her work......a teaser to actually immerse yourself in her book.  The films had to be done on very limited budgets.  Her work deserves more.....but I do not fault the producers.  It is absolutely worth watching--and if you haven't read the book--by all means do it.

It's almost as though there was a severe budget reduction for the last movie. I paid $4 to rent this through Amazon...

It was also hurt by the change of actors  in the primary roles over the three movies.  Now that all three movies are available it might be better to just sit down and watch one behind the other.  It is an awesome book and the reason it took so long to make the movies is that the breadth and scope is simply too big for a single movie.  Atlas is too important a work to cut out big chunks to trim it down to a single 90-120 minute movie.

6816185,1,B00PLEF4XS,"Big Rand fan here... Part 1 was pretty good. Part 2 was meh. Part 3 got more ridiculous as it went along.

My biggest complaint is how they had Hannity *barf* and Beck *gag* as champions of Galt's philosophy. Way to twist Rand's message. Then I realized the studio is... Fox. Duh. They're just trying to hide the humanity of Rand's philosophy to politicize it for their own ends. I regret giving them my $2.99.

Aesthetically:
1. Dagny was an emotional wreck! I don't want to criticize the actress, she seemed nice, but she wasn't Dagny. Bring back Taylor Schilling from Part One! Galt was too young, Francisco too old... I could go on. But get Dagny right at least!
2. The torture scene tried to emulate Jesus on the cross. Not at all appropriate. If you're Christian, you might find that disrespectful to Christ. If you're not Christian, you might find it hokey and a blatant attempt to reach the ""Fox audience.""
3. It just got sillier and sillier... I often laughed at things that weren't supposed to be funny, just because the portrayal was so ridiculous. The love scene felt silly. The escape scene felt silly. The movie was definitely missing ""that something.""

Overall:
It's a complex story that's impossible to tell in-depth in three normal-length movies. However being produced by a major studio, I had expected all three movies to be cohesive and, well, good. If I may venture to guess Rand's opinion, I suspect she might have been satisfied with Part One but furious with Part Three for its political agenda and ""meh"" characters.",1467763200,,1540,4.7388059701492535

6816188,3,B00PLEF4XS,"I've just finished watching Part 3 ... and have already watched the earlier 2 parts.  Impression?

I took away 2 stars from this review but not because of the acting.  I think the actors in all 3 parts did their level best to portray their roles as they were written.  These movies just didn't cut it for me ... primarily because I think Ayn Rand's philosophies are faulty ... and partly because the people who wrote the screenplays (even though they may not admit it) think her philosophies are faulty as well.

The truth?  History has shown us that Communism/Socialism just doesn't work as an economic model.  The movers/shakers/thinkers are always marginalized ... partly by those in power positions in government and in labor unions ... and partly by lazy workers who know those in these power positions will let their laziness slide by and benefit them regardless of their efforts.

But ...

History has also shown us that Capitalism just doesn't work as an economic model.  Rand's philosophies assume, naively, that *ALL* movers/shakers/thinkers really care about the people who work for them - that they're willing and motivated to treat their producers (workers) fairly and pay them a decent wage equal to their efforts.  After 40 years of working in both the public and private sectors, I can tell you that this is pure unadulterated nonsense.  John Galt is an ""atypical"" example of a mover/shaker/thinker.  Frankly, it all depends on the people in power positions within a given business.  Some are in it for the grand scheme of profiting by properly rewarding their subordinates based on their productivity.  Others are in it for the grand scheme of profiting ... period ... without any regard to the well-being of their most productive subordinates.

Bottom line is that there's no clear HERO and no clear VILLAIN in the working world.",1467417600,,1847,4.9288025889967635

Atlas Shrugged is just too much for the motion picture industry to tackle.  The book is a roadmap to the horrible corporatacracy paradigm we have blindly subjected ourselves to.  It gives a solution, but this series flattened out that notion and killed it altogether.
Ayn Rand wrote as from the point of view of a woman enlightened to the heinous nature of a man's world.  Although the book has a more or less ""chick"" cult following, the wrap up cinematic flop should not be followed anywhere.  It never misses an opportunity to dissappoint.  Not one.

Ayn Rand has once mentioned Francis Ford Coppola as a director she'd like to see head the making of this film - i was baffled - but i now see that a Coppola production would be a few magnitudes better than this

while the script was as heavy-handed as Ayn Rand would have made it if she did it herself - everything else failed to match the novel's epic quality - most of the scenes were filmed as if they were in a middle-class backyard - with faux-Rachmaninoff background music that only heightened the seediness of the film

casting and acting was generally pitiful - most delivered their lines as if they were oratory - only a few actors made themselves comfortable with the dialog - giving them a naturalistic & convincing reading - principally Greg Germann as wimpy James Taggart - and Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida as Francisco d'Anconia (so the accent is legitimate Iberian)

the novel was bound to be difficult to capture on screen - but this series of movies made it look impossible - i vote for another attempt - but don't let Leonard Peikoff (heir to Ayn's estate) make the decision - the fact that he hasn't dynamited these films hint at a lack of taste and integrity",1458864000,,1466,4.458955223880597

Atlas is tolerable as an audiobook. But when I was a simplistic randian I did not relaize the books were awful writing and tedious except for Galt's speech.

6816275,3,B00PLEF4XS,"I bought this one primarily because I already had Parts I and II. If Ayn Rand believed in an afterlife, she would be turning over in her grave faster than a John Galt electric generator. Three movies, three different casts. The one thing I did like was that the team who came to free John Galt from the torture chamber said they were going back to get Eddie Willers. At the end of the novel Rand left him stranded alone on a disabled  train, while the rest of the passengers took off with a passing caravan of covered wagons.

It is one of the great tragedies of literature that Ayn Rand had such a falling out with Albert Ruddy back in the 1970's. The man who made ""The Godfather"" wanted to produce ""Atlas Shrugged""! Rand's paranoia and stubborn insistence on holding a veto over the finished movie stopped the project before it could even be started. This was in the era when the three networks dominated TV, the miniseries was all the rage, and shows such as ""Roots"" had a significant and positive impact on the culture.

""The Godfather"" is a story covering generations, told primarily through the development of characters and their relationships to each other, set against a critical era in American  history. The same format, with the same budget and attention to detail would have been perfect to tell the story of ""Atlas Shrugged"". Fortunately, Albert Ruddy is just as persistent as any Ayn Rand hero, and has acquired the rights to make the movie or series he always wanted to do.

6816326,5,B00PLEF4XS,"Its not often that a product of Hollywood contains a message for conservatives. Wow, is that an understatement! When the audience is conservative Christians, the air is event thinner. So, when a movie that extols the virtues of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and hard work, it should attract the attention of the Christian community.
Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt? is the final installment in a three-part cinematic adaptation of Ayn Rands perennial best-selling novel. Its about a woman and a man with a dream worth fighting for. They fight against a juggernaut of immoral and corrupt businessmen and politicians who refuse to embrace their dream because it would mean relinquishing their power. Remarkably, more than 50 years after its initial publication, Atlas Shruggeds depiction of government overreach and duplicitous politics appears to mimic todays headlines. The movie brings a strong message as a counterpoint to the government-as-benefactor message that seems to be prevalent in todays political dialogue.
Todays progressive rhetoric rightly identifies the exclusion of minorities, whose opportunities are checked by those with power while the institutions which wield power for the good of the majority go unchecked. Atlas Shrugged shows how the efforts of the smallest of all minorities, the Individual, are being squashed by government institutions in the name of the public good. The heroes of Atlas Shrugged refuse to be victims. They response is both inspiring and uplifting. Individual liberty, it is clear, is good for all of us.
Instead of relying on the government, the heroes of the story understand that the government is not meant to be the benefactor of the people. As a Christian, I have seen how the government usurps the traditional role of the Christian community in society at large. When Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of New Jersey, our church arrived on the scene only to be turned away by FEMA. Assessing damages and writing checks would have been more difficult if the mass of construction and repair volunteers went to work before the government completed the painstaking process of inspection. Further, we were told to relay the message that our assistance was not wanted. We were discouraged, to say the least. In Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt?, the main characters rise above the oppression of a powerfulbut self-destructingpolitical machine.
A movie like Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt? does not come around often. It doesnt get the backing of major studios and flashy star-power. The message--individual liberty, personal responsibility, and hard workis compelling and inspiring: an oasis in a dry and thirsty land, where there is no water.",1452643200,,2706,5.31002331002331

My criticism of the series comes not from the story, nor the screenplay, nor even the book penned by Ayn Rand, but from the inconsistency of the actors who portray the characters. This is not the fault of the individual actors, but the fact that each movie has different performers each time the next movie begins. In my opinion, if the third movie could be redone, using the actors from the third one, a little background could be added onto the beginning of the film, explaining why Dagny is flying her plane into an unknown danger. Adding maybe a half hour of history at the beginning and not being constrained by the obligatory 120 average minutes of most films, would have helped this motion picture become a stand-alone feature.",1451865600,,803,4.6223776223776225

Barring any spoilers from the book, the part III did a lack luster job of engulfing the movie watcher into perils. Fifteen minutes into the movie it was obvious that this was simply an end to a story that started to be interpreted in the cinematic arena very well with Part 1.  Part 2 identified with business owners who cherished their dreams and visions of business success.  Part 3, with a diminished cast in numbers and powerful and believable performances, was more reminiscent of a selected few people who decided to go on strike which lead to a lowering moral for both cast and crew and the viewers.  Although, with or without that strike, it seemed obvious that the same conclusion would result.  The saviors of this movie are the viewers who are intelligent enough to have vision of their own, to endure a story line, and to add 'powerhouse notion' and 'potential probability' to our memory banks even in light of a silver screen failure.  However, in a new light and with my last breath, I applaud the production of the beginning and the gull to conclude.

6816404,1,B00PLEF4XS,"The writing, the ""acting"", the production design... oh my dear lord: this was the Roger Corman part of the series, with cheesy sets and cheesy actors and a script that wandered about trying to settle on something resembling a resolution to this story.

Let's start with the female lead. At the end of Part 2, she's in love with this guy over here. But at the start of Part 3, she's suddenly hopelessly in love with John Galt, and the other guy just waves it all off with a simple phone message. Her brother gets married, then his bride suddenly dies  we have no idea how or when this happens, but suddenly she does. The dashing Mexican in Part 1 is now a dowdy, truly uninteresting guy that makes you wonder what women see in him at all.

Someone commented that this was like watching a graphic novel of AS. I would go even further and say this is the Coles' Notes version of the book, Endless exposition, exposition, exposition... with everyone talking about what they're doing instead of letting su actually see it happen. The ony moment that seemed to work  as much as anything in this film works  was Galt's big set piece, which goes on for about ten minutes and is really about eight minutes too long. (I know, in the book it's seventy pages. Whatever.) It's a cute gimmick at first, then gets tedious fast... and it, as I say, is about the only thing that works.

This movie missed the drama and tension in Ayn Rand's novel. There was no hint of her characters' complexity and heroism, a hallmark of her writing. It also presented a reductive interpretation of her philosophy. It's as if the producers did not read the novel.  Well, if they did read the novel, then they gave it very little thought. If anyone thought that making this movie, to complete the trilogy, would advance the cause of Objectivism and favorably reach a broader audience - too bad, they accomplished the opposite.

For a woman who honored existentialism, objectivism, and the sheer joy of to be experienced by doing things with extreme quality, the third part would have been a let-down had she lived to see it.

6816435,4,B00PLEF4XS,"Great fan of the books, and I enjoyed the movie series as a whole.
I'm going to review them as a singular package - because I cannot fathom a chain of events that would lead someone to just watch part 3.

The movies as a whole are actually pretty good - but they really suffer from a lack of Rand's monologues - the actual events of the book are far less interesting then the characters.  The first movie in particular, has virtually no extended dialog at all, but all three movies would have benefited from leaning much more heavily on some of the fantastic monologues in the book.
The one singular thing that would have most benefited the movies would be a great speech by one of the villains - that would have been a very welcome addition - overall I think they could have cut a lot of the events of the book, and had two or three good conversations / monologues in each movie and it would have been drastically better.
The movies fail to convey the decline of the world - until the real decline in part 3 - It would have been nice to feel it in part 1 more so.

Per movie specifics :
The first movie suffers from having a breakneck pace, its just snippets of dialog, rush rush rush next scene - it has some love in it though, and it holds it together.
The second one is clearly the best from my POV - it feels like they have hit their stride a lot more then the first movie - the pacing works, the motivations are clear, they actually talk more then 4 words once in a while, and I like the characters  - its also my favorite set of actors.
The third movie feels sloppy, its over simplified, and oddly emotional - ""your my forever"".
Too much bombastic music, too much americana.
It feels pretty much like how I was worried the whole series would feel - it doesn't though, the first two parts are much superior.",1442793600,,1813,4.23121387283237

The book is so much richer in plot, characterdevelopment and philosophy that it is just not fair to imagine this magnificent book could be captured in a few hours of video.
What is confusing is that from part I to part II to part III the actors keep changing!  In Part II Francisco is a dreamy Latin cutie; in Part III he looks llike a prize fighter that has lost the last three rounds.  The only consistancy is Jim Reardon, who gets snakier as the film progresses.
I was not turned on by John Galt.  He was OK, but not charasmatic and effective as the man who stopped the motor of the world.  The chemistry between him and Ms. Taggart was, in my opinion, non existant but tastefully done for the screen.  Just enough gratutitous partial nudity and open mouth kissing!

I  find there to be a philosophical/theological contradiction between the ideas promoted by Ayn Rand and the Christian worldview that I hold.  Though I agree that those who work hard, should be able to keep what they earn from their labor and their ideas. And people should not expect to get a free ride.  And I agree with this.  I also agree that the government should not penalize those who have created ideas and taken risks by compelling them to give up their wealth and ideas for the greater good.  The hitch is t hat the movie, seems to me, gives no room for charity or other social ills, addictions, or sin.  Greed is just as much of a moral ill as sloth and envy.  The movie seems to me to glorify some social ills and condemn others.

Overall this movie is not as dramatic as the previous two.  There is more of a monologue by John Gault about Ayn Rand's philosophy.  The drama of the relationships is gone.  The Christ type of John Gault (he is ""crucified"" at one point) falls apart.",1440201600,,1062,4.417525773195877

6816491,2,B00PLEF4XS,"Years ago, I spent weeks getting through every last page of this masterpiece of a novel, and found myself nearly in tears when I finished it...both because the book was over and also due to the realization of the value that this book would add to my life for years to come.  My life has certainly played out in a way beyond my wildest imagination, and it was with great joy that I have watched each the films in this trilogy.

However, while I, as a fan, adore the story, the film itself leaves me disappointed.  The acting is downright horrible at times.  I actually had to take a moment at the beginning of the movie to remind myself that ""this isn't a comedy.""

At the core of my problem with the film is that it dumbs down the arguments/convictions of the antagonists to the extent that you can't help but laugh.  It was as if the directors said, ""we want to take one side of the core philosophical argument of the book, and rip its arms and legs off, and then tell it to go into the boxing ring like you're destined for victory.""  It's an absurd scene to entertain, and yet that is just how it felt to watch this movie whenever the antagonists were taking up crucial screen time.

In the actual book, time is spent diving into the depths of each sides' arguments and it makes for a more intense experience, because you are drawn intimately deeper into the logic of each side.  In that sense, you come away from the book with a deeper awareness for both sides of the core philosophical issue that the book confronts, and also with a robust argument for why one side ultimately wins out (the objectivists...the producers...the drivers). This is what made the novel so powerful, and its absence from the film is what fails to help it overcome some sub-par acting.",1439769600,,1765,4.439628482972136

6816496,4,B00PLEF4XS,"I have been a loyal reader of Ayn Rand for over forty years, and have read all of her published works.  ""Atlas Shrugged"" I read so many times I lost count, but it must be north of twenty or thirty times by now.  I especially liked her books ""We the Living"" and ""Atlas Shrugged,"" so I eagerly bought all three of the ""Atlas Shrugged""  movies as soon as they came out on Blu-Ray.  I also read most of the movies' negative Amazon reviews, because I was interested in how Ayn's message was being received as America and the whole world slides with us inexorably into Socialism.
  There are basically three types of critics of these movies:
  1.  People who are happy to see Socialism swallowing more and more formerly free peoples around the world, especially Americans, all hate the movies (and the book if they could read and understand it).  They list all of the cinematic weaknesses of the movies and may leave it at that, but they often can't resist shining a light on their political and philosophical biases against Capitalism and Ayn's own philosophy of Objectivism.  In other words, they hate the message and to justify their hatred, find all manner of excuses to hate the movies.  If they had liked the message they would have cut the producers some slack.  Either way, bottom line is that they are intolerant about the message in these films and her novel, even offended.  So, their opinions are heavily biased from the start.  Conservatives hate Ayn Rand because she was an atheist.  Liberals hate Ayn Rand because she does such an excellent job explaining why socialism doesn't work.  I suggest you read some of their reviews (one & two star reviewers), and decide for yourself whether they or Ayn make the most sense.  Most of them have never read ""Atlas Shrugged"" and if you have not, I suggest you do so.  Ayn does a much better job of illuminating Objectivism in her book than could be done in any movie(s).
  2.  People who have not read ""Atlas Shrugged"" and came to the movies with a relatively open mind, but criticize the movies for their cinematic weaknesses.  Certainly, these movies are not perfect, with 1 being the best and 3 being the least perfect.  A very common criticism of them is that the cast changes from movie to movie.  This is in fact true to the book in so far as the book covers the lives of the main characters from childhood through middle age.  So, changing the young actors in movie 1 to middle aged actors in movies 2 & 3 is valid.  I thought the producers did a good job with the cast in all 3 movies, with the exception of movie 2's Dagny Taggert, who was too middle aged and too plump to carry the role.  Dagny in the book was a strong woman who took care of herself and was meticulous about her appearance.  That said, it is a small failing.  Most of their other cast decisions in all 3 movies are fine.  The Dagny in movie 3 is very good.  But movie 3 has way too many narration scenes telling us story points, but not showing us.  This is a problem, because it interrupts the pace of the drama.  But, they just didn't have the money to turn those narrations into acted scenes, and the story would have had big holes had they left them out entirely.
  3.  People who have read and love ""Atlas Shrugged"" and criticize the movies because they don't equal the book.  But, movies are usually thin broth compared to the books from which they are made.  Yes, these movies are low budget.  Yes, changing the actors from movie to movie makes them a little disjointed.  Movie 3 is set in nearly the same time period as movie two, so this complaint is valid.  But, no big Hollywood studio is ever going to put big money into movies made from Ayn Rand's books.  Hollywood is simply too liberal, being the second most liberal city in the extremely liberal state of California, (after San Francisco).
  But, every lover of freedom must read ""Atlas Shrugged"" and see these movies, at least once.  This is the only place they will see the facts about Capitalism, Objectivism and Socialism explained so well.  In several of Ayn's essays, she makes these points about the four basic forms of society on Earth today:
  1.  In Capitalism, the individual owns the means of production, and private property rights are nearly inviolable.
  2.  In Fascism, the individual owns the means of production, but the state dictates what they must do with it, and private property rights hardly exist.  The state dictates how much of what products are to be produced at what cost and sold to whom at what price.
  3.  In Socialism, the state owns the means of production and private property rights extend only to personal property (houses, cars, etc.), but not to the engines of commerce, (factories, mines, mills, etc.).
  4.  In Communism, the state owns the individual.  There are no private property rights of any worth, combs and hair brushes maybe.  The individuals are told what jobs they will have, where they will work, where they will live, where they will shop, etc. The individual is enslaved to the state.
  Why, I ask, would anyone want to live under any system but Capitalism?  Why would anyone want their private property rights diluted?  I have a friend in Europe, in a very socialistic country, and he told me that taxes on overtime income are so high that he makes less per hour than on straight time.  So of course, few people voluntarily work any overtime.  This in turn puts a significant drag on his country's worker productivity and in turn gross domestic product.  Why would anyone want to live that way?
  The answer came from Ayn's own lips in an interview she did with Phil Donahue, ""Anyone who speaks of the common good is either of the state or they want to be of the state,"" (i.e. either a government employee or politician or someone who wants to be a government employee or politician).  Phil then stated that a great many people think she is crazy.  She answered, ""They don't.  They want YOU to think that.
  What more do you need to know?
  People who identify with the state, identify with the ruling class, don't like Capitalism.  Why?  Because they hate to see the power of government diluted with OTHER PEOPLE'S individual freedoms.  They want to see the government use its muscle to compel their fellow men to live like they want them to live, behave like they want them to behave.  They want this so much that they are blind to the resulting loss of their own freedoms.  That anyone would think it is better for the state to own or dictate the means of production, than for private individuals to own it, means such individuals are blatantly jealous of everyone who has more wealth than they have.
  I think a government safety net can be a good thing.  But, it should be there to assist the ""wounded"" of us; our most vulnerable members of society.  We should carry our wounded, and ""nurse"" them back to as much ""health"" as possible.  The rational reason we should have such a safety net is that our society as a whole and all of its individuals are made stronger by helping as many as possible of our wounded return to productivity.  But, when the safety net becomes a dreadnaught redistribution of wealth intended to carry the stragglers, it is too bloated to be good for society or individuals.  It has become a force that limits both the productive individuals and the stragglers.
  Why would our society opt for such a bloated safety net?  The answer is that our ruling class wants to grab as much power as possible.  They are never satisfied with how much power they have.  They always crave more power.  Never let a crisis go to waste, when you can use it to increase government power.  So, they have crafted a system that promotes and subsidizes our weaknesses, making us as dependent on government as possible.  Compelling us to behave as government dictates or else they take away the dole.  They have already socialized healthcare in every western country, INCLUDING America.  So, now they have power over all aspects of our lives.  There is hardly any part of our lives they cannot control via this weapon.  As time goes on, they will consolidate their gains and we will lose all of our freedoms one by one.  Freedom to smoke tobacco?  Heavens no!  Your smoking will drive up healthcare cost by all the lung disease, so we just cannot have that.  Freedom to eat junk food?  Heavens no!  Your body fat will drive up healthcare cost with all the heart disease, so we just cannot have that.  New York City already regulates the salt and fat in restaurant food and the maximum size of soda pop drinks that can be sold, so don't think that my warnings about socialized healthcare being a lever for government to control all aspects of our lives is too far out there.
  The clearest point the book and these movies make is that socialistic government creates many more problems than it solves, and the solution to the problems it spawns is always more socialistic government.  This drama is unfolding in real life all around us.  Forgive me for picking on healthcare system again, but it is just too tempting an example.  It is absolutely true that America's healthcare system is very broken.  Costs and prices are spiraling out of control, and have been doing so since the last major overhaul of the healthcare laws during the Reagan administration.  The problem is that the patient is not the doctor's customer.  The insurance company is the customer.  The patient is the insurance companies' product.  The patient often does not even see the prices paid, let alone be empowered to shop around for the best care for the price like consumers do for every other aspect of their lives.  You can price & feature shop for a microwave oven, but not for your knee replacement, because you are not given all of the information and choices you would need to do so.  Small wonder then, that prices and costs spiral higher and higher.  About ten times higher than anywhere else.
  And, what was the solution?  The Affordable Care Act (Obama Care), which pushes the healthcare system even further into Socialism.  The solution to the problems created by socializing healthcare a little was to socialize healthcare even more.  Immediately, the federal government was telling the insurance companies that they had to cover birth control and all sorts of procedures, whether or not the patients needed or wanted those things in their policies.  No wonder the healthcare policies' premium prices were so much higher than anyone predicted.
  What would be a better solution?  Let all medical insurance companies offer policies in every state, to anyone who wants to buy them, and let the patients decide which types of healthcare they want their policies to cover.  More competition.  Less government.  Less Socialism.
  This is all that Ayn Rand was trying to teach us.  Pay attention to her message.  Tell others.
  So, for the message they convey and for bringing my favorite novel to life on the screen at last, I give movies ""Atlas Shrugged I, II & III"" four of five stars.",1439683200,10,11026,4.632177961717537

At least in Part II, the character of Francisco d'Anconia was a handsome young man. But several decades must have transpired between Part II and Part III because the NEW d'Anconia had aged considerably, replaced by a familiar Latin actor most of us will recognize as the drug-lord de'jour in many popular films. And if anyone is still in the dark about the Ayn Rand philosophy that is supposed to undergird these films, fear not. You'll hear it preached dispassionately and ad nauseam throughout Part III.

The acting was weak even though some of actors were the same from the first two; this would indicate poor direction. The first two movies weer not leaning towards this behavior and I was as disappointed in his behavior as I was in the quality of the movie over all.  The first two movies were showing how socialism does not work in a free economy and people were shutting down their own businesses and 'disappearing'.

The speech he made was also thankfully shortened from the book.  It was great but very long.  I loved this and the whole trilogy.,1436659200,,484,4.252747252747253

6816597,3,B00PLEF4XS,"This is a difficult movie for me to rate. I loved parts one and two, but part three was highly disappointing. I was overjoyed when I heard of part three being released and was excited to finally watch it when my wife bought it for my birthday. I popped it in and within minutes was wondering if I turned on the right movie. The book is a masterpiece that deserves a spot in everyone's bookcase but the part three movie leaves a lot to be desired.

I barely noticed the actor change between the first two, and although some people were disappointed with part two, I still loved it just as much. Part three replaces strong actors that fit the book well with a cast that could've been randomly selected from a cheap beginners acting course. From the beginning, I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera or one of those lame informational skits you might see on a government website explaining some process in dummy terms.

In parts 1 and 2, Dagny was a strong powerful woman that looked like she could easily run a multi-billion dollar corporation and get things done. In part 3, Dagny looks like an over-stressed house wife that just left a few screaming kids at home to come do this movie for a day or two. John Galt seems to be an older man with a lot of wisdom and experience in the book, but here is portrayed as a younger middle aged guy that really doesn't have the backbone of the character he is playing. Francisco was previously portrayed as a younger playboy but is now a fairly weak looking older man. At the very least they could have swapped the actors for John and Francisco. Seriously, why does the alleged playboy look 10-20 years older than John Galt? Part two showed Wyatt as a strong intimidating business man, but Galt's Gulch seems to have turned him into a skinny less masculine cowboy in part three.

The narration is also terrible. It sounds like they went back in time and grabbed the guy from the old claymation Christmas movies to give a for dummies overview of all the scenes, and then someone accidentally left him in there.

I don't want to give a one star review because it's still a great story with a great meaning, but it's far from what this book deserves.

Overall, I'm glad I now own the trilogy and will likely watch them all again in the future, but I still wish there was a better budget and cast for this final part. Maybe someone will one day remake it.",1435363200,,2395,4.397291196388262

6816606,2,B00PLEF4XS,I read the book and was disappointed with the three Atlas Shrugged movies.  The third was probably the most disappointing.

I was disappointed with Part I, found they did better with Part II other than they changed the entire cast.  Unfortunately, Part III is back to being on par with Part I and the casting in Part III was the absolute worst (entire cast changed once again).  I almost switched off the movie when the actor who played Francisco got introduced.
The acting was just bad and I actually fast forwarded through some parts because I wanted to get to the end as soon as possible without actually turning off the movie (in retrospective, I should have).  The story was told disjointed, in puzzle pieces with half the puzzle missing. Someone not familiar with the book would be completely lost and it was also sleep inducing.

The most startling example of this being the Francisco d'Anconia character which morphed from the charismatic , youngish playboy from the previous film, to a middle-aged,  soft, doughy unintriging non-factor in this third installment. In addition, the Dagney character played by Samantha Mathis in the second film was far more appealling than the actresses in both the 1st and 3Rd installments. In fact, the entire cast of the second film seemed to me to be the most superior. The John Galt character, as represented, as well as the enrire film as a whole seemed more the stuff of a ""made for T.V., movie of the week""  than the quality of a feature film.",1434412800,,841,4.700680272108843

6816642,3,B00PLEF4XS,"I'm a big fan of the book Atlas Shrugged and reading it is an unforgettable, life-changing experience.  It took Ayn Rand 10 years to write it and it took me about 6 months to read it. By the time I finished reading the book, I was sad that it was over and I wanted to savor the moment.  It felt like I had finished running a marathon!  When I heard that they were wanting to turn this into a movie, I was so excited.  In hindsight, it was a foolish endeavor thinking that in just 3 movies one could accurately and effectively portray the ideas, characters, theories, etc from the book.  Sadly, I think this last movie was not very good, and how could it be with such a small budget and less than 90 minutes to portray Part 3 - A is A?  Every single sentence of every paragraph that Ayn Rand put on the pages of this book has purpose and DEEP meaning.  Some of the conversations span almost entire chapters.  John Galt's speech alone took me 3 hours to read.  It's hard to be critical of the actors and all the people involved in making the movie, because I appreciate their goal which was to spread the truths in the book for today's generation.  Unfortunately it was an impossible task before them.  I think a TV series spanning 3 seasons with your standard 20+ episodes in a season would be a much better way to get this book into America's living rooms.  That would give directors and writers time to delve much deepter into all the characters and conversations.  For example, by the time you finish reading Atlas Shrugged, you really know what kind of evil bastards Dr Ferris and Wesley Mouch really are.  Watching the movie it's just not the same.  Better go read the book instead.  Better yet, get the audio books and listen to it in the car during your commute.",1433894400,,1768,4.36085626911315

6816653,2,B00PLEF4XS,"Atlas Shrugged is one of my favorite books. The reason I'm giving this movie only 2 stars is I feel like the point of part 3 of the book wasn't well represented or not clearly articulated in the screenplay. Part three of the book and what this movie tried to represent was about the main character, Dagny Taggart, losing all hope for society, free markets, and capitalism and for people to be rewarded according to their effort instead of their need. She was one of the last holdouts of these concepts, and thus was one of the last people to disappear. The focus of this movie should have been more about her trying to hold on, and trying to find any reason to continue. The climax of all of this is her finally giving up and this was hardly apparent in the movie.

I'm very happy about the effort of the producers of this movie to try and articulate Ayn Rands vision of the future, but is so many ways it missed the mark.",1433721600,,922,4.2988505747126435

There were some good performances, but very inconsistent. The story is such an epic depiction of greed, corruption, heroism and impending apocalypse, but this concluding episode just fell flat. I think Ms. Rand, who actually wrote screenplays for the likes of CB DeMille, would be shaking her head sadly at what was done to her magnum opus.",1433462400,,486,4.939024390243903
6816663,4,B00PLEF4XS,"I can see why the reviews are so mixed and varied in the ratings. Atlas Shrugged parts 1,2 & 3 are not for everyone. There are 3 things to consider before watching this series. The first is your political viewpoint. If you lean toward a more liberal stand on the world then this movie will bother you to an extreme, and is probably why it was not highly publicized in the first place. The second reason to consider is the change in cast for each movie. Every character that you get attached to, or like, or dislike changes from movie to movie. This takes away from the continuity which is why I removed a star from my review. I don't like having to figure out which actor is playing which character. I shouldn't have to do that with sequels and definitely not the entire cast. The third thing to consider is the price of admission for what appears to be a made for TV version of Ayn Rand's books. They are well done stories and the acting is great, but the budget and sets are limited.

Those are the things to consider when renting. They are not necessarily bad things, as you see I gave this movie a 4 star review because the story was a great story. The acting is great and both myself and my wife couldn't help but see the glaring parallels to the setting of the movie to our nation here in America. I'm not saying we are as bad as the book or movie were claiming, but there are similarities, enough so that it makes you take a step back and contemplate at the intuition that Ayn Rand may have had into the political system so many decades ago. The story is captivating enough that my wife and I rented all three movies. We enjoyed them very much and wished it had gone even further at the end and told what more had happened to the main characters other than the ending of the story, but I will not give that away. No spoilers here.

This is a highly political, slightly science fiction, near future, drama that will question the world around you. Great movies. Who is John Galt?",1433462400,34,1984,4.302139037433155

The characters were nothing like portrayed in the book. Francisco was an old man at least 20 years older than Dagney, Galt and Ragnar. Project X was turned into Project K for some reason. And the torture device used on Galt was little more than a car battery connected to an old metal box spring. Reardon was more or less non-existent in the movie.  I thought they did a good job casting actors for the ""bad guy"" roles. The movie was ""B"" rated and very cheesy.  It was an impossible venture to begin with, so kudos for at least trying, but I doubt Ms. Rand would have approved.

The tone of the movie is that of a librarian reading to students in public library,where you want to get through the book, but don't really care about what you are reading. The actors lack the resolve that the characters supposed to have: they are on strike and not just taking a stroll in the park.

6816713,1,B00PLEF4XS,"So bad! I mean, utterly bad in every way. Both in form and content it just fails so hard. You know how some movies are so bad they are kind of good, in a fun sort of way (like some of the stuff on the Syfy channel)? This isn't one of those movies.

From the horrid acting to the plodding, uninspiring script, the thing is just ridiculous. I teach cinema and I was impressed at how far off almost every formal element that goes into a typical movie was so thoroughly disregarded and/or executed at such a consitently low level. Just sticking to Part III, the cinematography was uninspired and I think I even spotted a few jump-cuts. The sound design and score were schmaltzy to the extreme (like an audio Hallmark Card in places). The production design could be called ""pronounced blandness."" And so on. The production values of ATLAS SHRUGGED III make most Lifetime Original movies seem like Oscar-winning masterpieces...

Here's the thing: I liked the book. I interpreted it more as a stand for individual acheivement and a pronouncement of Rand's Objectivism (Noble Selfishness) - like 'The Fountainhead' on steroids -  but I never mixed it up with political ideology. The whole trilogy was kind of hijacked as a grand(?) political statement. If one could see through the complete low-budget sub-student-film-quality failure of the movie itself, then a whole other arguement could be made for taking what could have been a rather timeless theme and weighty philosophical viewpoint and heaping it into a mire of self-conscious preach-to-the-choir propaganda.",1431907200,,1559,4.9655172413793105

6816756,5,B00PLEF4XS,"It would be inadequate and an injustice to say that I am simply a ""fan"" of Ayn Rand, for that would do her an injustice, given the tremendous philosophical, economic, social and political insights she has bestowed on us, not to mention the Rational Arguments with which the Conservatives have never had the courage to make use of, in order to educate and enlighten the American public on such important factors--societal and personal--which would not only support the Conservative/Rational cause but, in the long run, would help EVERYONE, from the most well off to the poorest. To think that well over 50 years ago, Rand put into the Conservatives' hands, free of charge, the most conclusive defense of their beliefs, a defense which they don't have the guts to touch, certainly explains, to give but one example, why we have a certain President in the White House and have been steadily heading down a decent, the depths of which we can only imagine.
Liberals are Liberals: Rand just accepted that as a given. But she conserved her greatest contempt for the Conservatives who were (are) working against their own best interests.
Of note, shortly after the first ""Godfather"" came out, (to tremendous acclaim), the Producer of the film approached Rand, indicating that he considered her work a masterpiece, (not often said in Hollywood!), that he would like to buy the movie rights, and would be as faithful to the novel as possible, saying he knew the burden of responsibility he was undertaking to do justice to the novel he wanted to adapt to the screen. He already had lined up, I believe, Alan Delon (Francisco), Faye Dunaway, and Clint Eastwood (?) for the major roles. He certainly had the credentials (and proper ideology) to turn ""Atlas Shrugged"" into a great movie, but Rand turned him down for he wasn't able to give her script approval, given that the novel would have to be trimmed down, scenes combined, etc., which is perfectly understandable, given its size and scope. A tremendous loss, in my opinion, as an excellent adaptation of the novel could have come out as early as the mid-70's.
Nevertheless, we will always have the novel. But (sorry to say), a film would receive a greater audience. Let's hope that the right person will pick up the property in our lifetimes and do justice to a novel that could be absolutely riveting (i.e. at once, ""entertaining"" and money-making) on the screen, if done properly.
Also of note, Rand wrote the screenplay for the ""Fountainhead"" which butchered the novel. And Gary Cooper (a great actor) is so bad in his speech in court that it's downright embarrassing, especially given that he was up to the task and had already given, so convincingly, quite a number of fairly long speeches in earlier films, (i.e. ""Mr. Deeds,"" ""Meet John Doe""...). And to think that ""We the Living,"" which was illegally produced in fascist Italy during the war, is such a wonderful film and the best adaptation of a Rand novel to date--it's such a loss to all of us who believe in Capitalism and Reason.

 Again we have a total switch of cast and director from Part 2, as we did from Part 1.  I found this lack of continuity to be distracting.  But it speaks to the burdens the producers had to bring this Ayn Rand novel to the screen at all.  They just couldn't afford to keep the cast together.
 We do have actors with familiar faces in this edition, if only in the secondary roles.  Greg Germann, Larrhy Cedar, Rob Morrow and Joaquim de Almeida all have faces that we will recognize, if perhaps not the names to match with them.  The point being that the cast is made up of actual professional actors even if they are not famous actors.  We may not say the same for director James Manera.  This is his first time out as a full length movie director, ditto for his efforts as the script writer.  None of the flaws in the film can be put to his work either as director or as writer.  The problems must be awarded to the original novel which is given to prechyness.
 In this climatic edition we have the creative people of the world, seemingly a few dozen of them, hidden away in a secret valley in the Rocky Mountains.  They confab while lessor folk run the nation right over the economic, political and social cliff.  Which it does.  The policies put in place by the rulers have nothing to do with economic efficiency, human dignity or any genuine desire to wisely guide the nation.  The policies have everything to do with putting all control into the hands of a clique who have as a goal the simple accumulation of total power.  We know how this has worked out in the past, and yet we have strong advocates today for ever more concentration of power into the hands of the central government.
 As a movie Part 3 hits the low end of what we can accept from Hollywood, about a two saw blade film.  As political theater it rates only a little better.  But as a cautionary tale for those with the patience to sit through the three film series it hits the spot.

These scenes did not enchance the mood, they actually killed it.  If you remove those scenes, and some of the poorly done slow-motion, you might only get 45 minutes.  Out of that, at least 15 minutes is pure voice-over that is being used so that you actually know what is going on in the movie, which leaves about 30 minutes of bad dialog, poor acting, and only a few sets.

6816819,1,B00PLEF4XS,"Warning, there will be some spoilers in this review.  Because of the mediocrity of the trilogy I didn't buy any of the movies but watched them through Netflix.

I was extremely excited when it was announced Atlas Shrugged would finally be made into a movie but after watching each segment of the trilogy I can only say I was extremely disappointed.  Although the series does a decent enough job of making Ayn Rand's point of the importance of liberty, free enterprise, property rights and rational thought and the dangers of government which seeks to oversee society the series got progressively worse with this last installment being awful.

Many of the actors playing the lead roles in this third movie I've seen before (in Burn Notice, Herman's Head, Men in Tights, Ally McBeal, Fast Five) but none of the performances were in the least bit inspired.  Although a fine actor Joachim de Almeida looked old and tired as Francisco D'Anconia and the movie omitted D'Anconia's important speech on money.  Laura Regan did passable work as Dagny Taggart but the movie was far too short to adequately develop the romance between Dagny and John Galt making their love scene near the end seem only awkward and contrived.  I couldn't buy Kristoffer Polaha as John Galt and his casting just indicates that this movie was definitely made on a budget.  Greg Germann seemed lost as James Taggart (but again, the brevity of the movie made it difficult for the actors to create much substance for their characters).  The character of Ragnar Danneskjld I had always pictured as being Scandinavian in origin but in the movie he was portrayed as being perhaps American. This movie was also sabotaged by the makers inserting an absurd torture scene of Galt and implausible rescue for the movie's climax.

Finally, the dramatic speech that John Galt gave in the book is severely shortened in this movie and didn't have nearly the impact it should have.  The makers of this third installment did Rand poor service by making it entirely too short (just an hour and a half) and the whole trilogy was hamstrung by the rotation of actors playing the lead roles (some of the actors in the first two movies did a far better job than ANY of the actors in this installment).  It clearly did not seem like a work of love and indeed, the makers seemed to get bored with it all and made it short just to be done with it.",1428624000,3,2388,4.700239808153477

6816823,1,B00PLEF4XS,"I have been so disappointed with the way Atlas Shrugged screenplay was written and produced in this trilogy. The first one was okay and if they'd stuck with the original cast they may have been able to pull of the following two movies. But they got progressively worse. This last one was an utter disappointment. Atlas Shrugged was one of my favorite novels. I like Ayn Rand's views but the movies, and frankly the novel, make Dagny Taggart a rather promiscuous adolescent that I have a hard time respecting.",1428624000,2,508,4.719101123595506

I want to sit down and binge watch all three of them.",1428624000,,285,3.6666666666666665
6816825,4,B00PLEF4XS,"I have been looking forward to the release of the third installment of this trilogy. For what it was, I'd have to say that it was pretty good. That may sound like lame praise, and so it is. To begin with, the entire endeavor was pretty ambitious. Ayn Rand's epic novel is just that, epic. It would be difficult for any cinematic interpretation to fully do it justice. The fact that the three installments of this effort feature three entirely different casts of main characters does not work well. Continuity suffers.

The storyline of the novel is complex and layered and, let's face it, is a novel of ideas. Rand did a good job of presenting these ideas and was also able to create  something of a thriller while she was at it. But it took her 1168 pages to do it. While I wish the movie version of Atlas Shrugged could have met this high standard, it didn't. So, enjoy the movie anyway. Those who know the work upon which it is based will be well able to fill in the missing pieces.",1428537600,,985,4.3478260869565215

A low budget film that does not begin to do justice to the book.  It doesn't help that the actors change in each part.  This needs to be re-made by a major producer and released into the mainstream theaters--not just a few here and there.  Nevertheless, it is well worth the watch.",1428451200,,406,4.220779220779221

6816857,1,B00PLEF4XS,"Personal Disclaimer! : I love the BOOK ""Atlas Shrugged"", have read it three times over the years, and have given a copy to each of my kids as they graduated from college. I've shared my copy with numerous friends and colleagues; I admire  and like Ayn Rand's philosophy. That said, the three movies were a disappointment, each worse than the previous one, and this final film is awful. To begin, the acting is bad. It appears that none of the cast read the book, or at least studied their character from the book. The film omitted key events, most especially John Galt's complete radio address, which really sums up the Objectivist philosophy, and the costs of submitting to ever-increasing government tyranny. It was disappointing to see the book so poorly turned to film, because I think it will dissuade some people who might otherwise read and appreciate the book. I would encourage anyone who is interested in Ayn Rand's work to skip this movie and try the book...and if the size of ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a bit intimidating, start with one of her shorter works, such as ""Anthem"", or ""We, The Living"". A final thought on the film: This project would have worked better as a ""mini-series"", with more time for events, and a consistent cast from start to finish. That worked well for other ""sagas"", like ""The Winds of War"", and ""The Thornbirds"". Anyway, that's my two-cents.",1427846400,3,1373,4.76890756302521

The narrative style moved the story along but left a lot to be desired.  Doesn't follow the storyline of the book well as it diverges on several key points... missing is the explosion in the midwest that wipes out the bridge and most of the center of the country.  Other divergences are well noted also.  I could go on but the reality is, if you own the first two, buy this one.  If you don't it's worth renting to complete watching the trilogy.

For such a brilliant novel, I would have loved for John Galt to describe his machine and its inner workings to us the audience.  We know the machine turns static electricity into kinetic energy but how does Galt accomplish this?  I wouild have liked this explained more in detail in Part 111.  Also, in the novel Rand doesn't say how long before the  ""men of the mind"" return to reclaim civilization.  I was hoping the movie would explain that
more in detail.  I bought all three movies because of the greatness of the novel;I felt I owed it to the memory of Ayn Rand.  What the producers could have accomplished with a big hollywood budget would have been better than Star Wars.  I truly believe that.",1427587200,,852,4.5394736842105265

Because the three movies are released over 3 years ( I think), all the same parts are played by different people in each movie.  On a bright note, the message in this movie is so today!

The message in the movie was completely watered down as if the directors were threatened by the CIA or NSA to soften its effects. John Galt was a wuss and Dagny was a wall flower. John Galt should have been played by Anthony Hopkins, Hank Reardon should have been played by Pierce Brosnan and Dagny should have been played by Faye Dunaway. THAT would have been dynamic!

Three different directors and completely new casts for each of the three parts would seem a recipe for disaster - and it was.  While each actor did well with their roles, continually changing them did not help the viewers at all.  At least in this final episode Laura Regan brought back the younger looking Dagny Taggart and they finally answered the question ""Who is John Gault"".  I had a big problem with Francisco though.  In part one you had handsome Jsu Garcia.  I said to someone that Esai Morales would fit that role and low and behold in part two who pops up as the handsome playboy and former lover of Dagny, but Esai Morales.  In part three who is cast, Joaquim de Almeida.  Come on!  The man isn't at all handsome and looks more like her father than a same age former lover!  Whoever did the casting on these films should never work again.  The directing on this one  also was not very good.  The story should have gotten better treatment.

The first two were good (first better than second) but this was hardly worth the time; first the practice of having different actors in each movie made me have to take an extra second to connect everyone with the previous films and second their was hardly any energetic connection with the characters and the storyline which I think just fell flat and was glad to see it over.,1426982400,2,467,4.2

No.  honeslty I have not read these books but i can say this series as a movie got worse over time to the point where in the in end it was a libertarians dream. Acting was horrible, the Utopian dream was unbelievable, it was just stupid.  If I were to take the story in entirety, it gradually gets worse.  In the end you have these A-holes sabatoging all that is left in maintaining some kind of civility while ""hiding"" / ""hording"" a new energy. (the Engine).  The story they are trying to tell is bad enough but the actual production of this is below ""B"" rated.

6816949,3,B00PLEF4XS,"This is the third and last part of a three film adaptation of Ayn Rand's novel ""Atlas Shrugged"".  Due to various reasons, mostly financial, each film had its own cast members.  While each installment's cast did its best, the films suffered from the lack of continuity.  This last installment had the weakest cast of the three, and it was a bit sad to see the culmination of the novel to become a shell of what it could and should have been.

That being said, I still have the three film set, and it does set off a rush of thoughts by the generation next members in the family.  Upon their learning about government nanny states running out of control, and rapidly running out of resources, the more they can absorb and sometime champion Rand's point of view.  Centrally planned governments historically haven't done too well.

I have read the unabridged version of ""Atlas Shrugged"" and strongly recommend that anyone with even the smallest appreciation of any of the films do the same.  It really does say much that relates to today -- perhaps enough to justify her as a prophet of we are currently, and will later, suffer at the hands of well meaning but incapable bureaucrats who lust over the power to make others their serfs.",1426032000,,1229,4.631336405529954

For God's sake, if you haven't read the book, do so. It's a sprawling magnificent, epic story, a monument to individualism and achievement.

6816981,1,B00PLEF4XS,"The first thing you notice is the music.  The soundtrack is of amazingly poor quality, as is every other aspect of ""Part III.""  The second thing you notice is the exceptionally poor screen play.  Then, the editing.  (The so-called sex scene was the least sexy scene I've ever seen and it was interrupted by a railroad scene!)  Considering the extremely poor acting one sees here,  I'm wondering why they just didn't use the same actors for each of the characters in the book throughout the three parts.  Such unknowns can't be in that great demand.
I loved the book and consider it to the one of the best books ever written.  But, THIS film makes Rand's philosophy seem, at best, silly.
I was totally unimpressed with the living conditions in Galt's Utopia.  (Almost everything in ""Utopia"" had to be imported from the evil empire outside its borders.)  And I couldn't help but think of W.S. Gilbert's remark when questioning an all-white elitist society: ""When everyone is somebody, then no one's anybody.""  A society cannot exist without different social classes.  (How come Dagney's black second-in-command didn't get invited to join the elite?)
Literally, it made me cry that in every aspect this film is so bad.  And the credits at the end are nearly as long as the film itself!  The names of everyone on the planet are listed as major contributors to this mess.  This seems to go against Rand's idea that people are NOT equal.
I can remember a time when movie-goers were considered so simple-minded that the good guys had to wear white hats (and the bad guys, black).  In THIS film, the actors chosen to play Rand's characters almost seem to have been selected for their individual physical beauty - or lack of it  - the most-evil character being portrayed by the most unattractive actor.  And every effort was obviously made by the make-up department to make an unattractive human look even MORE unattractive!
The quality of the torture device used on Galt is laughable.  It reminded me of a scene in an old TV series ""Superman"" episode where the villains try to kill the superhero with sparks!  Dagney, of course, manages to bring Galt back from the dead with a kiss!

The make out scene with Galt and Dagney seemed VERY out of place and a bit creepy if you ask me.  Seemed like they just threw it in there. Making out in an underground train station???  Just odd.  The message of massive government intrusion is the big take away.  The more government is involved the worse things get.  And now they've taken control of the internet via the FCC???  Very BAD news.  We need LESS government not more.

""They would be the shepherds over us, their sheep. Certainly such an arrangement presupposes that they are naturally superior to the rest of us. And certainly we are fully justified in demanding from the legislators and organizers proof of this natural superiority.  Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim -- when he defends himself -- as a criminal.

The state tends to expand in proportion to its means of existence and to live beyond its means, and these are, in the last analysis, nothing but the substance of the people. Woe to the people that cannot limit the sphere of action of the state! Freedom, private enterprise, wealth, happiness, independence, personal dignity, all vanish.  When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law.

The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else.  Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.""  -  Frederic Bastiat",1425427200,,1862,4.80503144654088

6816995,4,B00PLEF4XS,"I have just finished watching Atlas Shrugged III - and felt I had to add my two cents worth to all other comments here. First of all I am a huge fan of the book and am firmly believe that it should be required reading by all, specially in the times we are living. There is no possible way that the book could have been translated into a 6 hour movie and do total justice to the book. But considering all the bad publicity and the bad reviews I am pleasantly surprised that Part III was made at all. According to Wikipedia - Part I was budgeted at $20 Million and only grossed 4.6; Part II had a $10 Million and grossed 3.3; while Part III only had a $5 Million budget and has grossed (so far) only .8. This is mainly the reason for a different cast for each of the movies. In this day and age who is really willing to commit to a project such as this.  Personally, the movie deserves 5 stars just for effort alone and where they could have chosen not to do the third installment, they went ahead and did it no matter what. As far as the movie itself, we must realize the original novel was published in 1957 and set in an ""indeterminate"" future. A lot of the technological advancements and gadgets we can not live without today, were not even thought of back then. So in some aspects by bringing the story to our own time, some of the aspects of the novel needed to be changed and I thought that was handled perfectly. Someone also mentioned about how the sex aspects was not handled the same, but lets face it, in that respect women nowadays have left the Dagny Taggart of the novel WAY behind. I guess the objective of the producers were to stick as much as possible to the main plot of the book which was the Strike and what happens when we as a group willingly give up our freedoms to the Government.  Look around you. Do not tell me that a lot of what goes on in these three movies (which by the way are all in Rand's book) does not resonate with what's going on in our country. Bottom line, as I have said before, this is a book that should be read by all, but for those who are not up to the task, they should at least watch these 3 movies.

6817001,5,B00PLEF4XS,"Fast response, fast delivery, thanks.  Love the book (read it 5 times), love all three movies.  Ayn Rand's epoch novel and the three part movie are no longer fiction.  The current occupier of the White House and his political party have made this novel/movie more of a documentary then a work of fiction.  I think the producer of the move did a good job in staying  faithful to the premise of the book, considering the constraints of their budget and difficult task of condensing an 1,100 plus page novel into 5 hours of film.  Probably would have been better if it were done as a mini-series for TV and film.  Actually, my only major complaint with all three movies was the switching of the cast between each part.  Should have contracted the original cast for all three movies (difficult on a limited budget).  It seems that Rand's dystopian America she depicted in Atlas Shrugged is quickly becoming a reality.

It was a story written for the 1940's and 50's about the industries that were premier than, steel, rail roads. It doesn't take into account the changes in the world, the information age, the importance computers play today in industry so it's just doesn't come across as believable. It needed to be completely rewritten. Take the characters and update the story, a real reboot of the story, like Star Trek, Batman Begins, or my favorite Battlestar Galactica. Where they took a silly 1970's TV knock off of Star Wars, really made for kids, kept the premise, the characters, the structure and turned it into a first class political drama for adults that just happen to be set in space.",1424736000,,936,4.5773809523809526

6817059,2,B00PLEF4XS,"From Part 1 to Part 111, it was hard to identify with the main characters since the actors were not the same. I definitely think that the screenplay could have been improved if the producers had used whatever Miss Rand had completed. Integration was vitally important to her and I am sure her draft reflected that.

6817066,1,B00PLEF4XS,"It takes a lot of guts to try to make a movie out of this book---for several reasons. The first, of course, is the sheer length of the book, akin to War and Peace. The other, equally obvious, is that the philosophical and political message in the book/film is anathema to the leftist Politically Correct hyenas that infest Hollywood and the overall media.

Now as to the first film: many of the characters are excellent. Taylor Schilling is superb in coming across as a no-nonsense executive surrounded by mediocrities who are constantly sabotaging her. Grant Bowler is also good at being stiff upper lip as he, too, is surrounded by whining, evil mediocrities. His wife (can't remember the actress' name) is also good at coming across as a ball-busting bitch. There are a lot of good secondary character actors. There are some problems with the script, primarily in that it doesn't really drive home the message just how bad things are, a lot of crucial details are left out, and, that the problems are a worldwide phenomenon, as was the case in the book.

Now as to the second film: it was a shock to see the entire cast replaced. Taylor Schilling, howevever, was irreplaceable, yet she was and the film suffers as a result. Sometimes it seems as if the character actors are shouldering the film. In short, it is not as good as the first. It takes up after the Colorado oil fields are set on fire and ends when Dagny crashes her plane.

The third installment was bad, no getting around it. The cast in once again replaced and not even the character actors can hold up the film with a terrible script that wastes a lot of time in a love interest between Dagny and Galt. A lot of the time that could have been used to bolster the plot is wasted on panorama views of Colorado and the Galt community.",1424649600,,1798,4.526153846153846

Dagny in part 3 was so much younger than in part 2. She just did not fit the part. John Galt was perfect  in every way. Eventually bad casting  and Character changes are put aside to hone in on Ayn Rands great novel put to action before your eyes.

The screenplay referred to some parts of the story lines without really illuminating them, while cutting out some of the best parts entirely.  The acting ranged from okay to cringe-inducing.  I found it interesting to watch mainly to see how someone chose to translate the book into film.

When I read the book I found much of the story compelling, but it bothers me that so many people take it as an truthful depiction of our society today.

John Gault is practical and illusive. Yet in the movie John (Kristoffer Polaha) can be easily found and it seems that he is into shock therapy. They make it look like he is into S & M.

Francisco d'Anconia is supposed to be Dagny's childhood buddy; now played (Joaquim de Almeida) at 50 looks more like Dagny's uncle; can you see her on his knee?

If you thing the actors were a strange fit wait until you watch the story.

6817089,1,B00PLEF4XS,"I read the book, Atlas Shrugged on the recommendation of an exceptional
high school Physics teacher around 1971.  It was a great book.

Now I have a spoiler.
All her books have the same weakness.
She brilliantly lays out her ideas and value through the plot, characters, and literary genius.

Then she ruins it by having all the ideas presented in some sort of speech, trial or something where she simply tells all her ideas, an insult to people who actually could read
and understand her books.

In the Fountainhead it's the trial.  In Atlas Shrugged it was the speech that repeated all the ideas by John Galt.  The movie was true to the book in only this one category, John Galt
has a speech that repeats all the ideas for idiots, but unlike the book, it too is idiotic.

It's strange that the Tea Party adopted Ayn Rand as their figurehead.  She would think they
are blithering idiots.  The people that would have been left behind by the intellectuals and
people creating great things.

Now for the Movie.

Part I and Part II were great movies.  I watched them for free on Netflix.  Then I searched
for Part III, and found I had to wait for it.  Finally it showed up on Amazon Instant Video,
I instantly rented it and watched it.

It was not in the class of Part I or Part II.  There was really no drama, no complexities,
nothing new.  Total disappointment after Part I and Part II.

None of it was like the book, but we won't get into that.

There's no redeeming value to watching this movie.  But, by all means read the book.

6817190,1,B00PLEF4XS,As the third and final part of the Atlas Shrugged trilogy I expected the work to be at least of similar quality than the first two parts. Instead I got the impression the producers just wanted to finish the project as soon as possible and tried to condence the final and most important part of the book into a few minutes. The movie fail to convey the Objectivist viewpoint and also do not do Ayn Rand's artistic genius any justice. A terrible disappointment.,1423612800,2,459,4.542168674698795

He was a contemporary of Francesco. Too much muscle and too little brain.  The piece was disjointed.  Perhaps if I had not read the book it may have been a 'good' movie.

I would say in fact that the first 2/3s are quite good, but the last 3rd or so feels very rushed and incomplete (from Galt's capture on), having been familiar with the book or not (which I am).  Reardon definitely gets the shaft in this one too, he barely even shows up (I am guessing to make room for Galt to be Dagny's lover without making her look too, um, promiscuous or something like that).  And even Francisco, aside from being WAY TOO OLD has barely more screen time than Ragnar.  Anyway, if you have the first two you should get this one as well.

I was wrong!  Unbelievably, the 2nd episode has been cast with entirely different actors in the leading roles who once again, labor under terrible direction with a script that fails to breathe life into the characters living it. The 3rd and final episode, ""Who is John Galt?"" once again employs  new cast who again are incapable of delivering anything resembling believable performances, hampered as they are with the dialogue and direction. The worst of it all comes at the very end when with 'mysterious' lighting effects, the visage of John Galt emerges in a void to deliver a very long and pedantic message; a monologue which is meant to explain the philosophy behind the story which should have been implicit had the production proved successful.

6817208,3,B00PLEF4XS,I would be hard pressed to recommend this movie to someone though I had been waiting for the final movie for awhile  But as trilogy It is a hard to follow because most of the charters are played by different people of different ages who play the characters differently every time in each one  of the movies (think Original Star Trek compared to Wrath of Khan that kind of contrast of flow of story and plot per movie).  Would have rather have seen a single longer movie or a television movie version instead of three disjointed movies.  A lot of the the film was just like the book nice back-story to know but not that important to the story as a whole.  I also feel it would have worked well with the Dagney character doing a voice over to move the story along without all the side trips of unnecessary scenes.  They could have cut a lot of FAT off of this film and instead of trying to make a movie version of the book and just kept the main story and ideas.,1423440000,,960,4.218579234972678

They just weren't believable, and in a lot of cases, not well acted.  Still, the story itself is fascinating and very telling of what can happen when the government wrests control from the industrialists and entrepreneurs.  John Galt's stirring speech over the airwaves had to be cut from about three hours to maybe a few minutes.  It was the highlight of Rand's message, but the movie version left a lot to be desired.  There is, of course, no way you can begin to convey the depth of an 1100-page novel in six hours of film, but it could have been much better than this third installment.

It's really unfortunate that the producers couldn't use the same cast members in all three movies, at least for the major parts.  Laura Regan was pretty good as Dagny Taggart, but Taylor Schilling, who played Dagny in Part 1, would have been better.  Joaquim de Almeida did a creditable job as Francisco d'Anconia, but Francisco was supposed to be Dagny's age rather than 20-odd years older.  Hank Rearden was practically left out of the script.
The continuity was awkward between the end of Part 2 and the start of Part 3.  The screenplay toward the end departed a lot from the novel, possibly in the interest of wrapping things up quickly.  It would have been nice to see everyone back in the Gulch and, after the collapse, to see Galt tell everyone it was time to go back into the world and put things back together, as he did at the end of the novel.  That would have taken another three minutes of film, tops.
There were also some good things about the movie, of course.  Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Ron Paul played themselves.

Or why there is such vitriolic hatred of Rand, the book, and the movies?  Fact is, according to a Library of Congress survey, Atlas Shrugged is the most influential book in the English language (other than the Bible)---and that was a write-in, not even included among the suggested choices.  How is that possible? Only by friends telling friends, ""Atlas Shrugged has changed my life.""

Here's why:

A REVIEW OF THE BOOK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

BACKGROUND
Atlas Shrugged is a captivating novel. The greatest ""shortcoming"" is that the book is over 50 years old. The heroine is the vice-president of a major railroad company, and most of the plot revolves around her desperate efforts to keep the railroad going. In the 21st century, when the age of railroads is long past, this is certainly dated. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged, although contemporary when written, takes on the feel of a grand masterful allegory perhaps like Dante, Chaucer, or Swift. It is just as much ""fun"" as Alice in Wonderland or Gulliver's Travels--and just as serious as the Divine Comedy. Yet, if you listen to a hour of local and national news on TV every evening while reading the book--half of the stories will sound as though they were lifted from the book--so timelessness and universal is Rand's story.

This will probably be the most important book (to you) that you read in your lifetime.

WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
It is often described as ""Capitalism versus Communism"", or ""altruism vs selfishness""--but both descriptions seriously miss the point. What this book is really about is much more fundamental. It is about the nature of good and evil, and beyond that, the very meaning of life.

MORALITY
""But I'm a good person, so what value is this book to me?""--you may ask. Answer: You have certainly noticed that adult ""morality"" is full of all kinds of exceptions and contradictions. The truth is, the world of ""morality"" we adults have constructed is a sham, a fraud. It is no more than ""social convention""--which is to say, ""what most-of-us more-or-less agree to""--and actually, despite all the ""moral"" justification, has absolutely nothing to do with morality or right-and-wrong, and often little to do with common sense.

THE NATURE OF EVIL
Still, the question remains, ""Why isn't simply accepting the current 'social norms' good enough?"" ""Go along to get along."" Answer: To put it bluntly, the greatest evil the world has ever seen has been done by folks ""accepting community norms"" who thought they were doing good, or at least who could justify their actions as being ""socially acceptable"".

The truth is, you will be quite surprised when you learn the true nature of evil. Until you have read Atlas Shrugged, evil will remain a hazy mist floating just off your line of vision, which you don't look straight at, because you don't WANT it to exist. After reading Atlas Shrugged, evil snaps into sharp focus--and like a bully confronted--ceases to be a fear, and just becomes something distasteful to avoid.

LIVES OF LIES
As Rand richly illustrates: Just as eating too much fat can clog up your arteries, thinking ""too much fat"" can damage with your mental health. Some mental illness is physiological. But most mental illness is caused by unresolved internal contradictions. Reality is all there is. You do NOT have the option of living in your own private version of reality. Nevertheless, many, perhaps most, people live lives built on thier own complex lies. That turns smart people crazy, and stupid people mean and crazy.

MENTAL HEALTH
How do you avoid ""unresolved internal contradictions""? By knowing the difference between right and wrong, and never, ever, allowing a rotten board to be used in the construction of your mental house. The problem is the old ""slippery slope"". Lie to yourself just once, no matter how trivial the lie, and the next one will be easier. Before long, you realize that you can justify ANYTHING--and with the blessings of the popular culture. And before you know it, you've lost your soul.

THE MEANING OF LIFE
As Rand preaches, the meaning of life is integrity. Living without compromise. To live a life filled with joy and pride in yourself, made possible by being free of mental conflicts. To know, not merely hope, that your mistakes were honest mistakes. To live with the knowledge that you are the best you can be, while striving to be better. To be a joy and comfort to the people you love. To give generously of your time, wealth, and love simply for the joy of doing so. To be a person who has changed the world for the better when you have gone. That's what Atlas Shrugged is really all about. All of the other themes, even Communism vs Capitalism are peripheral supporting themes. It is precisely because the fundamental issues are so basic and primary, that the implications are simultaneously universal--applying to all aspects of life.

6817320,2,B00PLEF4XS,"I had been looking forward to Atlas Shrugged 3 ever since the end of Atlas Shrugged 2. Maybe my expectations were too high but I was quite disappointed in 3. It took me a day of pondering to figure out why I was disappointed, but I think I have figured it out. Remember the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey? Amazing special effects and an odd plot - a plot that had to be pondered a bit (actually, a lot). When the movie 2010 came out, EVERYTHING was explained - to the point of making the movie boring and with nothing to anticipate. Thats how I felt about Atlas Shrugged 3. They movie was not intended for those fans of Atlas Shrugged - it pandered to those who don't understand the philosophy or don't care - and aren't likely to have their minds changed anyway. The movie kind of treated us like children by explaining every philosophical point in simplified terms which made for a boring movie. Some of the characters were casted well - but some not. Dagny Taggart? Too young. Antonio dAnconia? Too old. James Taggart was well casted.
Of course, the book and the philosophy stand strong in my heart, particularly in todays society. There are those who don't like it, but many that don't either haven't explored it enough to make an educated comment, make incorrect generalizations based on inaccurate media garbage (Ayn Rand is a cold heartless, selfish bitch that didn't care about people), or simply don't believe in the principles of free enterprise, free markets, free minds, and free societies.",1421884800,,1499,4.660377358490566

Hank Rearden pretty much gets ignored. Galt's soliloquy which runs for something like 80 pages in the book is cut to a just a few paragraphs. While I didn't want to listen to him talk for an hour, this was too much of a cut. Meanwhile they stretch the film with several sequences of just looking at landscape.

I understand some of this is inevitable on a limited budget, but the first two parts built suspense and kept my interest. This one, not so much.

The first 40 minutes of the film occur in Galt's Gulch, a.k.a., Atlantis. This could have  and should have  been condensed to a quarter of that time.

To engage an audience  especially a movie audience  a script should _show_ and _dramatize_ the themes and ideas, not just talk about them. Even the ""climax"" felt anti-climatic.

I donated to the Kickstarter campaign to pay for advertising this film. Sadly, I wish that money had been spent on a better script.

6817326,3,B00PLEF4XS,"I have read Atlas Shrugged and many of Ayn Rand's (and associates) books. I find her philosophy to be very in line with my own approach to life and morality, but she gave it a much more thorough and elegant foundation. It was a very uplifting and affirming read! I really like the book and its intent - to convey her philosophy through example in story. This had the makings of a great movie series. But, I must say that I am disappointed in this series.

  As has been said by other reviewers, the movies have gotten weaker as they progressed  with the last one being the worst.

  One of the biggest factors is the actors being switched out in every installment. They can make whatever excuses they want, but I think it comes to a lack of foresight in getting the first cast under contract to run the whole series. This is a distraction that takes away from the message and the making of a great movie that would bring in viewing customers and spread the message  which to me should be the primary point in making this series.

  The actors (especially those who played Dagny, dAnconia, Reardon, and Wyatt) seemed like anemic versions of their better selves in the first and second movies. Their presence, expressions and mannerisms just did not fit their characters nor the capabilities of the actors in the previous films.

  The wasted time in this 3rd installment was particularly annoying! There is so much to try to fit into three movies compared to the content of the book that I feel much more message, story building, etc could have been accomplished verses the long scenic driving scenes with the cheesy musical style instrumentals going on. I want the message! How many times do they have to show the redwood/sequoia tunnel, mountain tops, redwood/sequoia forests, etc while driving around in silence It was pointless wasted time. Now maybe if this was a glimpse into the real Galts Gulch and they were giving us a tease  I wish  then no problem  but its not.

  I didn't notice anything in the way of newly invented tangents to the story  and I understand that some of the side stories had to be left out to keep the length of the movie manageable. The storyline was maintained. So this was fine to me other than due to my previous points - they probably could have gotten more, better, content squeezed in to the short time they had to work with.

  Again, to me, the primary issue in making this movie would be to convey Ayn Rands ideas and Philosophy. More should have been done to accomplish this in the movie. I think without having read her books (obviously and especially Atlas Shrugged), a lot is missing from the movies. Something I noticed in particular, which was probably done on purpose to get more viewers (or I should say  not to alienate them), which I believe would not have been acceptable to Ayn Rand if she were involved in the scripting, was the fact that they left out any of Ayn Rands issues with blindly following the mystics of the mind or muscle. I would say this came off as more of an anti-socialism/collectivist story verses the story of free men who question everything based on objective self interested reason  verses blindly following anyone  whether that be gods or governments. The government angle was covered to an extent  but the realm of gods and religion were left untouched. Again, I understand why they did this  but its not true to the story (left completely out of Galts speech), Ayn Rands philosophy, and her character. I have never seen her in videos or in print where she shuddered to be up front about that aspect of her philosophy.

  So, overall  its good. Its a better message than getting no message out  but it is lacking theatrically and contextually compared to the book. As such, I have bought all three movies and would again, but I really wish there were a better version. I have read a rumor that a 30+ part mini-series is in the works. I don't know if there is any truth to it, but I think that would have the potential to do this book, message, and Ayn Rand justice compared to this movie series.",1421798400,,4071,4.55433287482806

While there was at least one screenwriter that was the same, it didn't have the heart of the first two parts.
I do wish Ayn Rand could have been involved in writing the screenplay 40 -50 years ago when the screen rights were discussed.  Then it might have been a good movie like The Fountainhead.  Too bad this interesting philosophy goes nowhere in the last part.",1421798400,,714,4.51937984496124

6817331,1,B00PLEF4XS,"Here we go again.  If I'm richer and I'm smarter or more successful, it's ok that I rule over everyone else or lord over them because I've earned that right by proving myself successful, or because my parents were wealthy and it must run in my genes.  Having read ALL of Rand's books too, I get the message of Rand, which is: Totalitarianism and/or feudalism is ok as long as it's brought about by market forces (the same forces driving the formation of kingdoms, communism, dictatorships, and yes, even democracy).  Even worse, it's explicit (written in crystal clear descriptions) in Rand's books that the weak, handicapped, retarded, etc. must be left aside for the sake of efficiency and truth - we are not responsible for them in any way.  If you doubt the previous sentence, just get Rand's books from your library and read.  Democratic republics actually work, but only if we don't believe stories like this one.  Everyone, including myself, who's created our own successes without a nice inheritance (or other any other hand out) knows that the fact we paid less taxes when we were poor allowed us to save and invest early so that we could become successful and eventually actually pay the true price of this democratic civilization (known as taxes) without that cost being a burden to our, or our children's, food and housing budget early on.  Common sense, I know, but, not for Rand, she believes the poor are lazy ""takers"".  I can almost understand her (Rand's) idea that I should take all direction when it comes to my life and personal choices from a rich person, because they have achieved actual, measurable, success in terms of their bank account.  However, I don't want to live in that world, because that is not really freedom and it's not the civilization all of us expect and deserve.  I'll gladly take advice from a rich person or give it as a successful person, but I don't expect that advice to be forced on me or upon another.  I also agree with Rand that communism creates massive suffering, BUT, the U.S. does not have, and can not have, a communist form of government despite what Rand continuously implies.  The truth, as the founders of this country laid out, is that our democratic republican government is actually a force for good, serving the desires of the majority in a peaceful way, and it was not intended to be a monolithic tool to serve the wealthy as England was at the time of the founding of this country (the type of aristocratic system Rand would seem to want to have us return to).  Celebrate the true freedom of our democratic republic!  Don't let Rand tell you that a government democratically and peacefully serving the majority such as ours is actually an instrument of theft, when in fact it is a driver of our civilization and peace.  She never spells out her alternative our government, but, it's clear from reading her books, it's not a democracy.  She's a creative complainer with no solution.",1421625600,2,2947,4.715399610136452

The acting was stiff and the last 20 minutes were truly unbearable. However, if you have enough vision to see past the superficial flaws...the cinematography of the valley was beautiful and the message is of the utmost importance. Does one person have the right to ""count"" on another person's (mind, competence, ability, work ethic, problem solving skills, compassion/empathy, etc)  for life? I say no. Every able bodied man and woman has the responsibility to take care of him/herself in the manner desired. Occasional charity/helping hands is not the issue. The issue is that there is an entire segment of the population whose ideology of daily life includes a 3rd party (gov't, neighbor, etc) and thus wasted opportunities for innovation, self reliance, and self determination.

It doesn't seem charitable or compassionate to me to willfully make yourself a burden on others or to always be the person in need with nothing to contribute. People who work hard (and with integrity) should be able to benefit from their action and those who choose not to should likewise have natural consequences from their inaction. That's simple enough but  politicians (of all sorts) have encouraged dependency to grow government and secure their jobs for the future. Self serving and short sighted as that kind of system is logically unsustainable.

I'm a conservative, but putting the current day conservatives Sean Hannity, Glen Beck, and also Ron Paul just destroyed this movie.

The actors in the first installment were pretty good I thought, but the new casts acting nose-dived in #2 and hit rock bottom in #3., The music and continuous scenes of the sun through the trees is ridiculous, the directing fragmented at best.

If you have two hours to kill, watch it while you're doing something else, like exercising so you won't feel so bad about the time wasted.

6817347,1,B00PLEF4XS,"I laughed. I cried. I groaned and sighed. Atlas Shrugged Part 3 is a complete train wreck of a disaster called a film. If you are not familiar with the novel Atlas Shrugged, it is the story of a society in collapse, when the greatest thinkers of the country decide to abandon ship, leaving the country to the looters and moochers to fend for themselves. The novel is intelligently written and is epic in scale. This ""adaptation"" of the third and final act of the novel is a complete mockery of the source material.

The production of the film is lackluster all the way around. Every scene looks like a daytime soap opera episode, complete with unrealistic lighting and annoying diffusion filters. It just looks cheap, in my opinion. The acting is melodramatic and boring. The editing of the film is not consistent, and the timing is off on many scenes.  Not to mention the sets all look claustrophobic and stale.

The script for Atlas Shrugged 3 leaves much to be desired. It all just seems very rushed and flows so unnaturally. We are given bits and pieces of narrative exposition throughout to help to understand the grand scale of events, yet the timing doesn't allow for anyone to understand the impact of what is going on with the country. There is yet another change of cast members, and many of the actors are completely miscast. Some not only do not match the novel's characters, but they don't even match up with the actors of the first two parts. Take Ellis Wyatt's character, for instance. In this film, he's a skinny cowboy with a dollar store Wyatt Earp mustache.  Hank Reardon is non-existent throughout the film and it is very hard to understand who is supposed to be playing who without using corny title cards to introduce them.

There is a lot that was not translated over to film, including Project X, which I had really hoped to see in a film adaption.  Also, the side story with Cheryl, Jim Taggart's wife is gone except for a  couple of scenes which are flashbacks or something, I'm not sure even why they were included at all. If I had not already read the book, I would have not known at all what the 2 second scenes with Cheryl are even about.

In conclusion, this film is a mess.  A complete disaster mess of an adaptation. Even Kristoffer Polaha, who was the only actor I really liked,  could not redeem this movie at all. The filmmakers, I believe, had every intention to faithfully adapt the novel into film, and I applaud their effort to complete the task at hand.

But all the actors are different than Atlas Shrugged 1 & 2 (which ruins the continuity), Laura Regan is just plain awful in my wife's and my opinion (if it was not for such a great story, we'd have walked away in several scenes just due to her bad acting), and a very gratuitous sex scene which seemed horribly out-of-place (I've not read the book; maybe they were just following Ayn Rand's writing).

Then you have the people that complain about the acting and quality of the film.  You need to take the movie for what it is.  It is a low budget movie that is meant to finish off the trilogy.  It is difficult to turn a book that is over 1100 pages into around 5 hours of film.  The premise is there and the story will last ages.  I thoroughly enjoyed all three films.

6817357,5,B00PLEF4XS,"I assert unequivocally and unapologetically that ATLAS SHRUGGED -- a literary masterpiece, epic in stature! -- is the greatest...the noblest...the most imaginative...the most unsurpassable work of fiction ever written by the most brilliant author who ever lived (or who ever *will* live) -- Ayn Rand!

Ayn Rand's ingenious plot -- prophetically alarming in terms of the destructive social policies of the Obama administration -- is a mind-blowing but farfetched improbability of events, which realistically could never occur in the world as we know it. However, Rand (the consummate Romanticist) creates a wondrous and *unexpected* world -- not as it actually *is,* but as it *could* and *ought* to be.

Rand's characters -- and I say this, not as a reproach, but as an admired statement of fact -- are not ""human"" in the ordinary understanding of such term. Instead, they are unambiguous abstractions of life-affirming (or life-denying) values, personified in their truest, most unadulterated forms. In other words, Rand's heroes are absolutely good...her villains absolutely evil -- either they exhibit the highest, unblemished form of moral integrity and an unwavering love for human intelligence and achievement, or (under the self-deluding guise of altruism and bogus concern for the ""public welfare"") they come across as the most wickedly depraved haters of humanity...unrepentant killers of the human spirit and of all that is beautiful and creatively alive on earth.

ATLAS SHRUGGED (the novel) is laid out on such an intricate scale of events and towering idealism, that -- even under the best of cinematic circumstances -- it likely could never be made into a truly successful film. Moreover, it would relentlessly incite the slandering hatred on the part of the cynical left and spiritually blind, and inevitably wind up being ridiculed as a farcical caricature of itself.

I award this flawed, clumsily produced, directed, acted, and absurdly miscast film -- a ""forgivable"" desecration of the novel -- five reluctant, unmerited stars, only because I cherish the fact that there were people in the world, who no doubt loved Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED as much as I did -- and who had the courage of their convictions to make (alas!) the embarrassing but heroic attempt to film it.",1421280000,5,2289,5.263013698630137

I hope that the sheeple who live off the work of others will take it to heart that when people do not see any benefit from their work they stop trying.

6817365,2,B00PLEF4XS,"I waited for this film with great anticipation.  I had seen Parts 1 (great) and 2 (ok), and I was hoping that they could pull a rabbit out of the hat here.  Unfortunately, no such luck.  The first two films were not blockbuster successes, but they were professionally built.  The only thing I can think of to account for the strange eccentricities of this one is that somehow, everyone in Hollywood got a sinister phone call:  ""You better not work on the third one if you know what's good for you.""

It's not just that the main cast got swapped out.  Even minor characters (Ellis Wyatt?!?!) are played by completely, jarringly, different actors.  Wyatt, portly, mercurial and a savvy businessman (Graham Beckel) in Part 1, here becomes a rail-thin, folksy Sam Elliot knockoff (Lew Temple).  That's as close as you could come, guys?  Really?

The leads - Laura Regan and Kristoffer Polaha, try hard, and even muster up a credible love scene.  Unfortunately, it's almost the high point of the film.  The rest is a patchwork of people driving, people walking,  people making phone calls, and people standing around in an enormous, overly-photogenic forest - what is, in moviemaking, called ""shoe leather.""  Unfortunately, it's not, in this case, attached to a shoe.  The film is a series of glued-together, almost standalone scenes, held together by a grating, and increasingly annoying, narration.  Everything is narrated, even things that are actually happening right on the screen are narrated.  Narration's a bad sign in a modern movie - it generally means you're filling an unintentional gap.  You ran out of money, or time, or script, or something.  But here, it seems they started with the narration and built the rest of the movie around it.  There are many scenes which actually would have worked better WITHOUT the narration.

This appears to be director James Manera's first time helming a feature film.  I wish him no ill will, and I hope he has luck in the future.  The result of his efforts here, unfortunately, is simply painful to watch.

The third installment ties up a lot of loose ends; the mysterious John Galt finally reveals himself, and we learn that he was also one of Dagny Taggart's lovers.

But to have three different movies with three different casts is ridiculous. For example, Dagny Taggart was played by Taylor Schilling in PART ONE, Samantha Mathis in PART 2, and Laura Regan in PART 3. It would have been smarter to film all three parts simultaneously, with the same cast.

Because all three movies had limited theatrical distribution, failed at the box office, and had poor home video sales, I doubt if ATLAS SHRUGGED will ever see the light of a movie screen again. Although the book is a long one, I still believe that some really talented producers, directors, writers, and editors could make one coherent movie of about 2 1/2 hours in length, as opposed to three 90-minute pictures.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind-75th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1451635621/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind, 75th Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;is a long book too, but was made into a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-classic/dp/B00O6MSDPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood classic</a>&nbsp;(although GWTW, while worth seeing once, doesn't lend itself to repeat viewings, in my opinion, because of its 4-hour length and heavy subject matter [the Civil War and its aftermath]).

Not a single person who appeared in this installment possessed the gravitas to carry their role. None, zero, zippo, nada. The scenes were very disjointed and didn't flow very well. I would like the writers to have taken more time to write a more concise and tightly woven script for this final third of the book. I've heard there are tentative plans to produce this book as a 39 part, 3-year series. If so, I'm delighted, because what this book desperately needs is character consistency. The first actress who played Dagney was the strongest for that role. The person who played Wyatt in the second film was outstanding for the character, as was the actor who played Reardon. Even the actors who played Mouch and the Head of State, Thompson, looked their roles in the second film. In this third film, I was left wondering if I had really seen the last part of this great book. I frothed at the bit waiting for this movie, and was crushed by its mediocre plot line and pace.

The plot seemed to vanish in part three and none of the characters where strong in their performance. Ian Ryan would have hated this depiction of her work because the message never really got the depth it deserves. It was more of a romance between Dagny and Gault than an expression of individualism and the little part that did attempt to deliver the message via the TV cut in fell way short of any passion for the cause. I gave it two stars simply because I ended up renting it and was able to sit through the entire film without turning it off which I almost did more than once. There could have been so much more to this film than there actually was. The ideals that Ryan is trying to expound  where so lost in the final film than I wanted to cry because it was so bad. Ryans ideal deserves a much better depiction on the screen as the message she is trying so hard to get out is so relevant in the society that we are living in today.  I have no idea what the writers where trying to say in this film  because nothing in it took form or shape nothing really told you what it was all about and you are left with a feeling that perhaps the writers were trying to tell a love story and failed at doing that also.",1420761600,3,1950,4.1319261213720315

Rob Morrow was Hank Rearden, but for less than 3 minutes of screen time, with only a passing mention of the love affair between him and Dagny (that dominated the storyline of the first two movies!). Very little continuity from the previous movies. The actors could have done a good job, but the direction and production were not present. I know it was crowdfunded, and the budget was low, to say the least. The musical score is a constant reminder of this throughout the whole movie. In all, I give it two stars, as I think I can tell the cast were trying hard...but the director needed help. the budget needed help. the script was heavy handed and made the acting seem very plastic. like a poorly produced soap opera.

I thought the music OK, the dialog OK (as in Part 1 & 2, it could have been better). But if you listen to the words and message, Rand's philosophy comes through clearly. The sex scene was totally out-of-place, rushed.

As a thinker, the message was clear and appealed to me and made the movie enjoyable. I do think the first movie was best, this, the least impressive. Glad I didn't do a major crowd fund now. Still after renting it, I now plan to buy, it's worth a second watch.",1420675200,,603,4.2894736842105265

Most of the primary characters have been jettisoned to focus on Dagny and John Galt - Rob Morrow's Hank Reardon is just a ghost, hovering in the background. Ragnar Danneskjold makes a brief appearance at a farmer's market in the Gulch.  I'd always envisioned Galt's Gulch to be a high tech utopia, a seed for what would become the world after John's plan succeeded.  But here , the steely but beautiful modern structures Rand described are gone. Instead we see something like a rundown ski lodge.
I recall a scene in the novel where one of the second handers hears one of his own compositions on the radio. Dagny recognizes is as a badly butchered version of a Richard Halley concerto.  Watching this movie, I found myself thinking of that scene again and again.

6817404,5,B00PLEF4XS,"Why not give this movie five stars?  The fact that it made it to the big screen is a miracle.
To begin with, Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a fantasy world that never existed.  There are a number of elements in the book that didn't make it to the screen--such as pervasive tobacco use by all of the main characters.  Back in 1957, smoking was sexy--smoking was civilized--and so was drinking alcohol.  Railroads were the major transportation artery; the Interstate was just starting and air travel was still novel. The novel was long, and ""Who is John Galt?"" is the third and final movie adaptation.
Rand had several strikes against her when she penned her ultimate novel: female, Jewish, relocated Russian, Hollywood screen writer.  When ""Atlas Shrugged"" was published in 1957, mainstream psychology preached that the human mind was nothing but an illusion--that ""reason"" didn't exist.  Communism was ""the perfect form of government"" and Soviet communism was progressing on all fronts.  Rand's fictional ""Railroad Unification Act"" became reality--real-world American rail roads consolidated their activies at their peak and a decade later the railroad system was in shambles.
This third movie began with John Galt walking out on the Twentieth Century because he refused to be a slave.  I thought that pre-title scene was well-executed.  After the titles, ""Who is John Galt?"" picks up where the second movie left off--with Dagny surviving a Lear Jet crash that reduced the aircraft to scrap metal.  Background events were presented as news flashes.  I commend the director for editing John Galt's three-hour speach to something more suitable for a 21st Century television audience--though Ayn Rand must be spinning in her grave, if her ""The Fountainhead"" movie is a valid clue to how she would have turned her novel into a movie.  Face it--""Who is John Galt?"" is a chick flick promoting capitalism.  It's a drama, a romance, a mystery picture.
When Dagny discovered how John Galt was watching her, it reminded me of Dorothy Gale's statement in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939 MGM edition) that everything Dorothy wanted was always within her reach.
WARNING: this movie gores sacred oxen.  Both TEA Party and Occupy Wall Street will find things to hate.  Ayn Rand fans can moan about dilution of the pure message.  Veterans of union picket lines can scream about their nuclear option, the labor strike, being high-jacked.  If you like feeling offended, you can find something in this movie that offends you.  On the other hand, you can also find something to like about ""Who is John Galt?""",1420675200,4,2581,5.0329411764705885

Am I an Ayn Rand fan?  Absolutely!  I discovered Ayn Rand in the early 60s since then I have read Atlas shrugged seven times and most of her the books more than once.  I still have all the copies of the Objectivist Newsletter published years ago by an Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Branden.

I have watched each of the films  almost immediately when they came out.....

The second movie was definitely a shock in that they changed every single actor/actress in the movie which didn't help at all into connecting us with the characters. But non the less it still felt like i was watching a normal movie with the idolgy not being a plaitantly shoved in your face...... Then came the third movie that was a nose dive in quality compared to the minor negative quality change between the first and second  movie. This was because of many things but the top to were the fact that i felt like i was watching a hallmark movie based on the acting talent (an i use the word talent very loosely), really the acting is probably the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie. The seconds and perhaps the most annoying reason that this movie was the worse one yet was because of how it felt like i was basically watching a Right Wing America Propaganda Video......

Part 3, failed in every possible aspect.  Poor acting, done by poor actors.  Poor script, with an obscene sex scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere (pardon the pun).  John Galt was portrayed to be nothing more than a hypersexualized, undeniably inept and poor communicator of a man.

I really liked the series as a whole and is the reason I am giving it 4 stars here.

The Lord of the Rings Two Towers was 2.5. Hell, make it in 3 parts and make each part 3hrs. whatever it takes. Of course finding an actor, a good actor would be impossible as the fact of being a Hollywood actor would mean that Atlas Shrugged would not be something they would do for less than their going fee and raising the money for that will not happen, so..

I admire the fact that at least an effort was made to tell a story that is so politically incorrect I only wish Ayn Rand could have been here to write the screen play.

6817467,5,B00PLEF4XS,"I have been a huge fan of ""Atlas Shrugged"" and other novels and philosophy books by the late Ayn Rand.  I understand that a complex set of philosophies and intertwined characters cannot fully display the magnitude of the 1000+ page book, but the trilogy for ""Atlas Shrugged"" portrays the evil philosophies that are killing our country and our world today.  If you have not read the book, I would highly recommend that either before or after watching the trilogy, but even the limited time for developing a full exposition of the book should show anyone that what Ayn Rand wrote decades ago is now coming to pass in our country and our world.  The manipulation of the media, the economy, the government, the banking industry, the culture--enough of that is shown in this third installment should make anyone with a mind fear for the path we are on.  Many scenes in the movie could be taken right out of today's news--the nationalization of industries (at least by overregulation), the effect of law breaking ""to help the poor"" in terms of health care, joblessness, Fannie & Freddie lending, and more--should make any viewer whose mind overrules their government-instilled guilt.  For a complete understanding, please read the book as well, since Ayn Rand more fully explains her beliefs that free-market capitalism benefits all people, even if some are jealous of the wealth earned by those who run those companies.  The redistribution of wealth has never succeeded anywhere and Ayn Rand knew it since she escaped Communist Russia to come to America because we were free.  She would be sorely disappointed in where we have thoughtlessly allowed our country to sink, but she would appreciate the effort of getting her story and its truth out even with the limitations of film over reading.",1419379200,4,1787,4.9366666666666665

Have not watched a more poorly made movie .. horrible direction, poor casting, screenplay, music .. there was absolutely nothing good in the movie and in stark contrast to think of the book by ayn rand, the fantastic way she portrayed the land of the utopia (galts' gulch) .. the magical way she had built and developed the characters .. ohh the movie is such a big disappointment .. anyone who has not seen this movie, you may want to spare yourself the ordeal and the disappointment.
Another big irony was the actors for the main characters changed with every part .. this was highly disconcerting and annoying .. admittedly three movies made over 2-3 years, you cannot get the same actors but i think they could be selected and casted with some more care to at least preserve some prior context and sane proportion of age and appearance.

Dagny changed all three times the last being the worst and so did francisco .. his casting seemed completely inappropriate and out of age in the final part .. Hank Rearden did not even have any presence whatsover in the final .. Elis wyatt again was poorly cast .. Ragner's and Hugh Akston's characters were not even developed .. they did not have any impact at all ..
the friendship of the 3 friends their bonding and with their teacher Hugh Akston also did not come through .. nor was there any effort to portray this bonding ..
The group of Wesley mouch and Thompson and Ferris looked like a bunch of jokers including James Taggart ..
