2608290,3,B000GFRI5O,All this chatter about Clive Barker should sue blah blah blah. He gave the money to get this thing rolling and in time he'll get it back. Although the acting was deplorable I found myself chuckling at some of the dialogue. Sooo clich`e ridden to the max. This movie was a cross between Night Of The Creeps and The Dead movies. James Van Der Beek is ok as our bad boy trying to right himself for killing a man in a bar. The rest of the cast just seems to be earning a paycheck. Dee Wallace is great as Nora the sheriffs wife. This movie never explains how the virus got into these kids and why it took 10 years for them to get up and walk around killing everyone over 20. I was confused at the ending too. Oh well why should there be any logic or common sense after all this is a movie and I do live in New Jersey. Its worth renting just for chuckles here and there.,1162166400,6,865,4.034883720930233
2608291,3,B000GFRI5O,"The movie looks and feels like a 70s horror movie. I detected no cgi. If you like Zombie flicks, this one will not disappoint.

2608292,2,B000GFRI5O,"It's a pretty sad fact, but the association of Clive Barker with any film no longer guarantees quality; heck, it doesn't even guarantee sufficient gore these days.  I've been a Barker fan since the very beginning of his career, but I'm not cutting him any slack on this one.  No, he didn't write this film's dreadful screenplay or seemingly invest himself significantly in the project (officially, he's listed as a co-producer), but he darn well let these guys put his name in the title and took his share of the cut.  The Clive Barker of old would never have let his name be associated with as bland, unoriginal, and boring a horror film as The Plague.

About the best thing I can say about the film is that I found it too boring to truly hate.  Anyone but writers Hal Masonberg and Teal Minton could have done a little something with the premise, but it's certainly not original.  It's just another variant on the old children take over the world motif.  In this case, all the world's children under nine years of age suddenly fall into a coma (interrupted by two daily, synchronized seizure fits).  Ten years later, they all suddenly awaken and go on a zombified rampage, leaving our heroes scrambling to stay alive, etc.  It's like Twilight Zone meets Children of the Corn meets every zombie movie you've ever seen.

Our main character, Tom Russel (played by James Van Der Beek), wouldn't you know it, has just arrived back in town, and - surprise, surprise - his ex-wife Jean (Ivana Milecivec) just happens to be one of the nurses taking care of all the town's comatose teens when they suddenly awaken.  Why we can't have a mindless zombie film without a romantic sub-plot is quite beyond me, but there you go.  Tom and Jean eventually team up with a tiny sheriff's posse, Tom's annoying buddy Sam (Brad Hunt), and a couple of weird, suspicious teens who keep blending in and out of the hordes of walking dead.  There's something suspicious about these two, but don't count on the filmmakers to pursue anything in that direction.  By the way, you also shouldn't look for any explanation as to the cause of the ""plague"" that caused this whole mess.

Feel free to argue amongst yourselves whether or not these kids, all very much alive, are actually zombies, but this is clearly just another zombie film - except, in this case, the ""heroes"" never really try to fight back.  Part of the problem is that they don't know where to run.  When zombies attack, you're supposed to go to the police station and load up on some heavy weaponry suitable for blowing the things' heads off.  These guys head for the one place that is guaranteed to house no weapon of any kind.  Even when guns are brought to bear, though, the gore is less than satisfying.  There's blood, of course - but not enough of it.

If you're a fan of inane dialogue, this is your film; those looking for a halfway decent plot, buckets of blood and gore, and/or anything remotely scary are sure to be disappointed.",1161907200,12,2977,4.600378787878788
2608293,2,B000GFRI5O,"What a great premise and start to the movie as most of the world's children fall into a coma.  10 years later, no children are born that don't fall into the same coma.  The stock market crashes, riots, the world is uneasy.  Then the children wake up and they are out for blood.  Sounds great, and the children first waking up is really scary.  Then the story just falls apart, and the ending is just stupid.  Nothing is really explained, and you are left empty at the end.  No real gore and average acting.  Clive Barker's name is attached, but he certainly did not write this.",1161734400,21,577,4.377358490566038

There is no explanation or cause given as to why these events took place. Clive Barker should sue these people for attching his name so blatantly to a film he merely co-produced. He didn't write the horrendous script or direct the the movie. I can't believe he took the job to begin with. I hope it was a favor for someone. If so, I think it could hurt his credibility. I would be mortified to be stuck with this on my resume. The sad part is, the cast was fairly decent, and I don't even like James Van Der Dork.

2608298,4,B000GFRI5O,"I was pretty surprised & wasn't expecting to like ""The Plague"".  I'm a huge Clive Barker fan but knowing he was only on board as a producer still had me a little worried.  Lots of times you'll see someone's name attached to something that had nothing else to do with the movie other than to sell it with there name.  Well, I'm happy to say this wasn't the case here(or even if it was, the movies still good).  While the movie has some what of a slow start (doesn't really get moving 'til probably 30 minutes in or so)you'll be glad you stuck around for the ride.  Like most guys, I'm not the biggest Vanderbeak fan, not to say there's anything necessarily wrong with him, he just got his start on ""Dawson's Creek""(not exactly the most manly show in the world).  Anyway, I didn't mind him here at all, in fact all the acting was pretty well spot on with only one exception.  Can everyone in Hollywood please make sure that ""Blonde Over Acting Afro Guy"" never ever gets to act ever again?  This guy almost coulda ruined the movie.  Just about every single scene is pretty gut wrenching to watch him in.  There is a nice pay off though as he's brutalised & then killed well, making up for his annoying, whiney over acting.  Anyway as far as the story goes, I'm never one to give away to much about the plot, but it goes something like this.  The worlds (coulda just been this one little town, don't know I missed that) children all fall into a coma for a period of like a little over 10 years.  When they awaken chaos ensues.  Little did I know, THIS IS A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!  Now I'm sure some will say ""these aren't real zombies cause they're not dead"".  Screw that cause they are, they're just not undead(as were the people in ""28 Days"").  Anyway, great creepy movie that kinda feels a little like a cross between ""Night Of The Living Dead"", ""The Faculty"", & ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"".  Good flick all in all, well worth at least a rental, might even be worth putting in your DVD stash for the avid horror collector.  Check it out, you won't be dissapointed.",1152144000,28,2061,4.376315789473685
2608299,2,B000GFRI5O,"I've always thought that Clive Barker was a progenitor of horror, probably since the first time I read his Books of Blood. His strange, sexually-charged, and at times heretic, stories push the boundary between the horror that we've already established and a darker sphere yet to be explored. So I was surprised when I checked out The Plague, a hybrid of classic zombie movies and crazed kids flicks like Children of the Corn and Village of the Damned.

At first, The Plague captures that sense of atmospheric dread of the zombie movie without necessarily presenting those facets explicitly. Children begin to drop into comas at the same time, and for the next ten years all children born are immediately comatose. They also experience seizures twice a day at the same time, flopping around on hospital beds like hooked fish. The opening is genuinely freaky, and it's not just because the viewer is faced with a vision of humanity reduced to a final generation. Well-choreographed sequences find the children foaming at the mouth, eyes rolling back in their head until only the whites show. It's tension at its best, and director Hal Masonberg utilizes slowly expanding camera shots to show just how catastrophic this plague has been.

Along the way, James Van Der Beek becomes the main showcase of this plague outbreak after the kids start waking up on the wrong side of the bed. His character Tom went to jail for a little while after killing a man, but now he's out and apparently is one of the few who knows how to do anything in a time of crisis. Tom's past is rather unclear, as is the underdeveloped relationship between him and his ex-wife Jean (Ivan Milicevic); as a whole, though, The Plague is overly populated with characters we know little to nothing about, and that makes them rather easy, unsurprising fodder for the killer children.

The film catches the plague itself during its muddled action sequences, which have awful choreography and even worse dialogue. This is due in part to the unknown cast; it's difficult to feel any type of suspense with they spout their lines with such melancholic fatigue. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't sustain the tension of the opening during the more explicit terrors of zombie (or heavenly) children.

But the writers also can't succinctly wrap up the plot that they started. The Plague tries to envision the last judgment, the Ascendancy, but instead of explaining the origins of the plague at the end of the film, it actually makes things more muddled and confusing. Are the kids sent as angels to bring those ready to the afterlife? If so, they did a pretty crappy job of it; and if this is God's way of congratulating the human race, I feel bad for the kids who are stuck on Earth with sunken eyes and a hatred of everything. In any case, The Plague is a dismal picture of God, though I'm not sure we're supposed to take it that way.

A film that starts out so strongly, with its eerie familiarity of the classics, ultimately flops in its latter acts because of clumsiness and a weak script. And after pondering for a while what exactly I was supposed to take from The Plague's message, and getting no answers, one can compare it quite nicely to the Bible: multiple writers with no apparent cohesion. It just makes me wonder what Clive Barker saw in this movie that made him want to put his name on it.",1316736000,,3363,4.712585034013605
2608300,1,B000GFRI5O,"The only thing that can be said in favor of this awful movie is that it is not as long as an awful Stephen King adaptation. Production values = 0. Acting = 0. Direction = 0. Writing = 0. Sadly, Amazon won't let us give a zero rating. This film was so bad, I didn't even want the bad guys to win. I just wanted every character dead.",1269993600,2,331,3.8823529411764706
2608301,3,B000GFRI5O,"Oh boy, talk about a movie that certainly had potential and fell completely flat.  Clive Barker's The Plague perfectly describes a storyline that initially appeared to be going somewhere interesting, only to turn into one of literally thousands of generic zombie shoot and run-adventure/horror style movies that have dominated our TV screens FAR too long.

Did I hate this movie?  Not quite.  The storyline seriously had some major appeal in my opinion.

One night, a bunch of children slip into a coma for no reason whatsoever, and upon rushing them to the hospital, well, the doctors and nurses had no explanation either.  In fact, the hospital itself was loaded with children under the same kind of conditions involving comas and experiencing the same exact symptoms at the exact time.

Sounds good so far, doesn't it?  Of course it does!  But read on my curious readers...

Unlike the Village of the Damned, the Plague gets much much worse.  Eventually (10 years later) all the children wake up from the coma, unexpectedly.  Of course, they turn into little monsters who want to kill everyone they see.

The parents of the children end up exploring the main school uptown, end up getting caught in an endless amount of heroic battles involving the children (who actually turn into ZOMBIES of all things, haha- well, intelligent ones that know how to shoot a gun apparently).

Eventually the parents venture on to church in an attempt to make it out of town alive, but well, you know what happens... the children follow them there, and more endless fighting ensues.

At least the adults questioned whether the children turning evil was the result of aliens or something else entirely.  I was thinking the same thing- nice little detail.

I can't believe the writers thought that turning the children into zombies was actually a good idea.  Okay, so they aren't TRUE zombies- but close enough for my tastes.  The ending of the film was good though.  A nice ending.

Let's not kid ourselves- this movie ended up missing pretty far off the mark.  Bad writing completely ruined it, however, the violent scenes were good enough to keep me watching, so it's not completely horrible.  Just a severely disappointing film.",1265932800,,2216,4.913746630727763
2608302,3,B000GFRI5O,"A fantastic idea, all the children in the world suddenly in a coma for 10 years, is wasted in a movie that is a mix of many other zopmbie-movies, the book  The midwich cuckoos and some atmospheric moments  of the Twilight Zone episodes. Not entirely bad but the question is..why making a film like this one if the idea cannot be developed in the adequate way ? They could  have saved more money , could have waited more time and then maybe a good film  could be today be reviewed.",1254873600,,480,4.3
2608303,3,B000GFRI5O,"THE PLAGUE is about all the children of the world suddenly and simultaneously going into a coma. From then on, every child that is born is born into a comatose state, without fail. During the time that the kids are in a coma, they all have seizures simultaneously twice a day like clockwork. Ten years later, out of nowhere the kids (most of them now teenagers or young adults) awaken from their coma and go on a rampage, killing every adult in sight. Once the stage is set and the group of protagonists are introduced (a nurse, a couple of police officers, an ex con and his buddy, and two teenagers who were only a handful of kids who did not succumb to the coma years earlier), the movie revolves around a few things: the creepy kid scenario, WHY the kids are doing what they're doing, and survival.

I actually enjoyed THE PLAGUE more than the average straight to video, low budget Horror film. The visuals and photography were slightly above average for a low budget Horror movie and the overall product is a bit more aspirational than your typical low budget Horror movie. I appreciated a few things about the movie: the film took itself seriously and didn't get silly and the kids in the movie almost resemble Zombies in that they're extremely pale and have blank looks on their faces, but they don't resort to ""Zombie violence"", meaning they don't eat brains or have an overwhelming urge to cannibalize their victims. They usually prefer to snap people's necks and break bones. The violence in the film is actually surprising because there is a lot more than you would think and it does get pretty brutal at times, but not OVERLY brutal. The actors in the film aren't bad either. I thought pretty much everyone in the cast was either really good or decent. Most low budget movies usually never fail to cast at least ONE actor or actress I can't stand, but not this one (well, James Van Der Beek kind of gets on my nerves a little). There are also a lot of creepy moments in  the movie. Normally I find the whole ""Creepy Kid"" genre to be stupid, but this movie actually pulled it off to a certain degree. Some of the Extras who played the kids were a little goofy or ridiculous, but for the most part it was OK. Overall I liked the movie, but I did have some problems with it. My problems were mainly the plot holes. For example:
**Where was the Police Department?
**How can a group of 100 or so unarmed (and outnumbered) kids completely take over a town? From the time they wake up to within a 24 hour period, their town is basically reduced to a ghost town. Granted, the kids eventually figured out how to use firearms but it wasn't until the end of the movie. And the fact that they knew how to even operate firearms, let alone even still have the ability to WALK, after being in a coma for ten years is pretty ridiculous.
**The ending made no sense. It started to get biblical in explaining the origin of the coma kids but did not really elaborate on it.

The verdict: Don't expect a Zombie movie and don't expect a total gore-fest. The premise is great but wasn't really executed that well due to the script and probably due to budget constraints. THE PLAGUE is not a great movie by any means, but it's decent and worth checking out.

2608304,1,B000GFRI5O,"One day, a virus puts all children, 9 and under, in a coma.  Twice a day, at 10 o'clock, the coma-induced children, go through a seizure.  This continues routinely for 10 years.  Then, after 10 years, they wake up from the coma.

However, immediately, you'll start to see that they are not the same people as before.  There's something sinister about them and they're zombie-like.  When they start to show who they really are, they're out grabbing their hands on every living being.

The zombie victims get everyone except this group of people.  It seems that their survival strategies are interrupted by the zombies.  We soon learn that, like the Borgs in Star Trek, they have a hive mind.  What's learned from one is learned by all.

While running around to survive, the surviving gang must decipher a priest's cryptic message that holds the key to this whole mess.

The story is simplistic but extremely cheesy.  And the survivors are extremely idiotic.

2608307,1,B000GFRI5O,"I am posting this review just to warn people off of this film. I agree with the posters here who have panned this movie and I won't recount the plot. But, because I am a writer, I can say that I was amazed that anyone (anyone!) would have put up the money to make this movie. The script starts off well enough (in premise, if not in dialogue) but when the characters started talking (i.e., before the kids wake up) there were warning signs. Almost nothing said by anyone in this script is logical, reasonable, or noteworthy. I kept waiting for the characters to at least follow the stereotypes for this ""kind"" of movie. But, in almost every scene, the characters say nothing (they just look at each other) or what they do say does nothing to move the story along. I kept talking back to the characters in the movie (a really bad sign for me) in a vain attempt to ""encourage"" the characters to start acting in a sensible way. I thought several times how the premise of this movie could have been used so powerfully had the producers bothered to actually read the script and then, seeing it was so senseless and bad, had the good financial sense to get a good scriptwriter to fix it. I won't go into how sad it is that the actors involved were wasted on it or, more pathetically, exploited by it (I refer to the actress who plays the mother of the girl who is tied up in the church and who eventually releases here just to be killed by her). I think it's sad when an older actor/actress takes a role in a crappy film just for the money. They deserve so much better.

I do want to mention one scene which was both needlessly offensive and revealing about the quality of the script. I refer to the short scene in the church when the deputy is waiting with the guy whose leg was broken (very easily broken by a young girl) for the others to come back with a vehicle. I was shocked when the deputy entered the room and asked if the guy with the broken leg wanted to eat ""the Body of Christ"". Come on guys, that line was stupid (it was a box of unconsecrated wafers) and needlessly offensive _unless_ it moved the story along. It didn't. The scene was more interesting a bit later when the two men are talking about what might ""explain"" the events they were witnessing (aliens, etc.). I laughed because I thought that even the characters were saying how dumb this script was...they were wondering aloud what it was all ""about"". Sadly, the fact that the two men are shortly gunned down had no meaning even if we take into account that the deputy suddenly is praying the ""Our Father"" prayer as he waits to be killed. I'm all for a story that looks into the nuances of religion or science or horror or aliens or _whatever_. But this story had no story at all because we (the viewers) never get to learn what the story is really ""about"", just like those two dead men who were never enlightened. By the final scene (where the camera zooms in on the copy of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in the back pocket of the boy who killed the ""survivor's"" boyfriend) this viewer was left slack-jawed by a script that finally expects its audience to accept some sort of vague metaphysical (i.e., religious) allegory. The script plays around with the idea of a ""soul"" but builds no basis for the final 10 minutes of the script. Oh, well, I know I'm just rambling now. Sorry. I guess I hoped that by explaining things I might make sense of the senseless. I can't.

As I've just explained, the ""the message"" in a script is the important thing and is especially important in a bad script (because sometimes the message redeems other failings). I have to say that this script had no real message at all. Just what was this movie about? Zombies? Religious allegory? Teenage angst? Moral sacrifice? Adults ""ruining"" the world for children and they get pissed and decide to nap for 10 years then wake up and start killing unless someone is smart enough to sacrifice a ""soul""? Huh? Maybe it was about nothing? Nothing at all. That's it: it was nothing.

The only ""good"" thing I can say is that I didn't pay to see this crap. I had a free rental coupon and in an impulse (it was a Clive Barker film, after all), I used the coupon to rent it. I should have checked the reviews here on Amazon as I usually do before renting something. In most cases, the people who are compelled to write a review here do so because they feel strongly (positive or negative) so although the reviewers are a self-selected group, usually the guidance here is useful. I say don't buy or even rent this dumb movie.

Oh, and I agree: Clive Barker should be ashamed. How the mighty have fallen....",1203897600,5,4630,4.399066511085181

2608309,3,B000GFRI5O,"Clive Barker's The Plague (Hal Masonberg, 2006)

I had meant to open with something about Hal Masonberg, because I'm sure I know his name from somewhere; I remembered this as being ""his"" movie when I sat down to watch it, despite not (that I recall) knowing that in advance. But a quick check on IMDB shows very little under Masonberg's name (this was his first feature, both as a writer and a director, and his only other credits are in casting and production assistance). Which leads me to the mystery of where I know this guy's name from, which unfortunately will probably keep me occupied more fully than the movie did. It's well-meaning and enthusiastic, and it's pretty hard to go wrong with anything that uses a Clive Barker story as its base, right? (Oh, wait, there was Rawhead Rex. Can that hypothesis.)

I should know by now that when a movie's cast is headlined by James Van der Beek that I'm not going to like the acting much. That said, he's got a pretty solid cast backing him up on this one-- Ivana Milicevic (Casino Royale), Brad Hunt (The Darwin Awards), Brittany Scobie (Maneater), and Dee Wallace (The Howling), among others. And the script starts off pretty darned cool; the problem, as has been pointed out by a number of critics, is that it slides off the side of the pool about three-quarters of the way through. To be fair, it's a difficult story to adapt, and many veteran directors would have had a problem figuring that one out.

The plot: something unexplained happens to all the kids in a small town, leaving them comatose. Fast forward to ten years later, and the kids all wake up, but they're not kids any more. (It's been compared to a zombie movie, and not without merit.) In short, they go on a homicidal rampage. It's up to a small cadre of survivors to figure out how to stop them.

For the first half-hour or so after the kids wake up, this makes a passable action/survival-horror flick, and the setup before the kids wake up is handled extremely well, something that always impresses me in movies like this. So I was going along enjoying this immensely before we go to one specific scene (not the climax of the movie, but relatively close). That's when it starts going downhill, playing into the usual horror-movie cliches with some moralist overtones and a final scene that seems to have confused a lot of people (the desirable ambiguity of the final scene is undercut by the sappiness, though).

The end result is Masonberg being a director who shows a good deal of promise, but may have bitten off more than he could chew with his first major project. I'll be looking for more from him as time goes on. ** ",1192060800,,2648,4.575949367088608

The movie starts out pretty creepy actually. One morning a man wakes up to find his son is in some kind of trance and rushes him to the hospital. Once there, he finds out that EVERY kid in the whole world has succumb to some sort of disease that makes them comatose, and then THEY ALL START HAVEING SIEZERS AT THE SAME TIME. There is nothing creepier than having a thousand little kids shaking violently on the floor at the same time. : shudder:

Ten years later the world's children are still in a sort of trance that they have no hope of snapping out of. Every child born after this is also born comatose so the world's nations start to outlaw child birth, all but dooming the human race to extinction. riots erupt all over the world as people try desperately to find a cure. The economy collapses and wars break out all around the world.

Then, without warning or apparent cause, the kids are awake, and their out for blood. the first minutes these kids wake up are so darn creepy. first, they all turn their heads at once :shudder: then, when an unsuspecting nurse walks into a room where they keep these kids, she's shocked to find them all standing up, looking very pissed, and ripping their IV's out of their arms. She, obviously, gets it.

Unfortunately this is where the movie goes downhill from a low budget classic like Night of the Living Dead to just another run of the mill horror flick, with just about every clich you can think of being thrown in. not to say it isn't creepy at times, I'm just saying that after the first ten-fifteen minutes there is nothing to seperate this movie from just about any other horror movie ever made.

I'm always amazed by how horror writers always make the same mistakes when making their movies. First of all, in a situation like this, it would not EVER be a good idea to just walk into the place where all these children were being kept, the freekin high school. Second, no sane person would walk off on their own to explore a dark creepy room where they think they heard creepy sounds coming from. Third, why does the Asian chick always have to die first while the white albino blond chick got to live? fourth, there is a part in the movie where they all go off to find guns at the police station, but when they had guns with them at eh church they just left them there.

Even with all the clichs and plot holes i was enjoying the movie quite a bit in a stupid kind of way. I was really looking forward to the kind of ending a movie like this should have, by which I mean a helicopter should have flown in and killed all the zombie kids in a big rocket attack and saved out heroes and take them to safety. That how stupid shoot em up horror films end because they are stupid, and people want to see gun em up endings for stupid movies. But noooo... they come out of nowhere with this spiritual type voodoo ending. The kids aren't really bad, their just misunderstood, blah, blah, blah.

in short, if you have nothing to do on a Friday night and you and a friend are just sitting around wondering what you should do, grab some food, pop this into your DVD player, get freaked out at the more scary parts, and curse the ending. But whatever you do, DO NOT take this move to seriously. You will be disappointed if you do. if you read this review, please leave a comment.",1189382400,,4116,5.257229832572298
2608311,4,B000GFRI5O,"i give this plague the rating it deserved. it was what it was, a good film. now it wasn't all bloody, and gory, and all that stuff that most horror movies have, it has suspense, and the best part zombies. as i've said before zombies are my thing. the whole film was good, i'll say it did have some empty holes in the beginning and the end. why'd they go into this coma, and why did it end the way it did!!! i liked that ending but it could've been better. the kids just go crazy and fall into a deep coma, then bam they're all in your face killing everybody that's not like them. they're running things, and it's up to our hero james van derbeek to save the few left, but then things get complicated, but he tried his best, and he saved at least his true love. i dig this kind of movies i give it props.",1188864000,,803,4.025
2608312,1,B000GFRI5O,"Writer/Director Hal Masonberg is fighting to get his film seen; a film he finished AFTER he was removed from the project. Now he's heading an international campaign to get his film released. The film in question is, THE PLAGUE, a thought-provoking, socially relevant horror movie dealing with the subject of kids and violence. THE PLAGUE was taken away from both its writers and director during post production after they'd spent a total of 8 years struggling to get it made. The film was re-cut from scratch by producers who chose to do so without the involvement of the film's creators. The new focus of the producers? To make what they called a ""killer-kid film"". Stock footage was added, new dialogue recorded, and the film completely restructured. This ""new"" cut of the film was released to dvd in September of 2006 at a running time of 88 minutes under the title CLIVE BARKER'S THE PLAGUE, though the film was not based on any of Barker's work. It was, in fact, an original screenplay by Masonberg and co-writer Teal Minton.

Not satisfied with having his name, or his writing partner's name, on a film he felt in no way reflected their years of hard work, creative input or artistic intent, Masonberg decided to finish the film on his own with the materials available to him -the dvd dailies and a Macintosh computer. Masonberg would have preferred access to the film's original 35mm negative which was shot by veteran cinematographer, Bill Butler (JAWS, THE CONVERSATION, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST), but such was not the case. Sadly, even Mr. Butler was not invited by producers to participate in the film's post-production process.

Using Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects and a host of other commercially available programs, Masonberg completed his cut of the film from scratch, teaching himself complex sound design and visual effects along the way.

Today, THE PLAGUE: WRITERS & DIRECTOR'S CUT has been seen by only a few, but the response has been through the roof:  ""It's amazing how people respond to this film,"" says Masonberg, ""It's not a splatter film, not a gore film. We wanted to make a film that harkened back to when horror films were made for adults and were a reflection of our combined social fears. People who never think about going to see horror movies are now asking to see this one again and again because of what the film says and how it says it.""

Unfortunately for Masonberg --and the public as well-- the film's current distributor, Screen Gems, has no plans to release this cut. The good news is that there is a web site, growing quickly in popularity, that is devoted to that very cause. On it one will find, not only a link to a petition with an ever-growing number of signatures, but an hour-long documentary titled SPREADING THE PLAGUE: INTERVIEWS ABOUT THE WRITERS & DIRECTOR'S CUT which contains interviews with Masonberg and cast members, including one of the film's stars, Dee Wallace (E.T., CUJO), as well as noted film authors/ journalists. All participants openly voice their desire to see this cut of the film released. There are also written interviews, radio interviews, links to forums and articles all focusing on getting this film out to the public.

2608313,1,B000GFRI5O,"Let me start off by saying that CLIVE BARKER'S THE PLAGUE isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It had a promising start--all the children in the world under the age of nine lapsing into a comalike state, foaming at the mouth and no one knows why and they remain so for the next 10 years. Then they awaken as pissed off zombies intent on killing everybody. But despite all this, I couldn't get passed the CLIVE BARKER'S THE PLAGUE title. When I see CLIVE BARKER's name attached to a film or any project,I tend to expect a certain level of achievement in horror, I mean, this is the man who created HELLRAISER, for GOD'S SAKE!!! And let's not forget NIGHTBREED, another one of my all time favorites!! CLIVE BARKER'S THE PLAGUE bears absolutely no kinship to those films, other than the fact that you can buy them all at the same store on DVD. Otherwise, they would NEVER be grouped together, EVER.

So, ok. If, you get get past the whole CLIVE BARKER name thing, THE PLAGUE is an ok little zombie flick, if you overlook the glaring plot holes. I'm sorry, but if I know that zombies are going to be chasing me, I want a GUN!! Not a wooden stake, or a wooden post. I WANT A FRICKIN' GUN!!! But for some reason, this seemed to be not on the top of the list for these characters. Go figure. Maybe I just being nitpicky. But I thought it made perfect sense--zombie--gun!! Just don't watch CLIVE BARKER'S THE PLAGUE with any kids under nine--just in case---they just might turn into ZOMBIES on ya!!",1181347200,2,1491,4.421818181818182
2608314,1,B000GFRI5O,"A strange virus affects all children under the age of nine.  They suddenly go into foamy mouthed comas and experience seizures at 10 o'clock twice a day.  Childbirth is in the process of being banned, because all children are born in comas.

Then, suddenly, 10 or so years later, the children wake up, and they're in really bad moods.  Zombie-like, running around and wrecking havoc on their towns.  They like to attack and bash people's heads and break necks.

Three friends, Tom, Sam, and Jean, after running from a school to a church, decide they need to make it to an air force base.  But wait, the children have developed a ""hive mind"", and they're disabling all vehicles and learning to use and store guns.

There's only one thing that can stop them.  The rambling diary of the church's priest leaves a clue that somebody must sacrifice a soul to these children to set them free.

That's about it, folks.  As a lover of cheesy 'B' films, I can barely give this one an 'F'.  To be short and to the point, there are no redeeming qualities to this film, very little gore, no suspense, no intrigue, no surprises, no monsters or daemons, no outstanding photography or soundtrack, no remarkable performances - nothing.

2608315,2,B000GFRI5O,"While the concept of the movie is interesting the follow through of the plot leaves much to be desired.  The plague itself was interesting but the reasoning behind it was a little farfetched.  As far as I understand it the children of the world (below a certain age) fall into a coma, and the only reasoning is that as a collective decided not to live in our barbaric world.  Please....I could've made a better explaination.  Try this on for size: Aliens were trying to take over through the use of younger generations, because something about their nature prohibits actual aggression.

2608316,1,B000GFRI5O,"This movie begins with a very promising premise, a slow wasting apocolypse as the world's children, those under 9 that is, have lapsed into a coma for 10 years then the 'all hell breaks loose' scenario is enacted when they all wake up in a murderously foul mood. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculousy cliched but if you're interested in watching this, dialogue is probably a secondary concern but this movie lacks in all other areas as well, no gore, barely even any dribbling blood even with shots to the guts and head! The action of gun fights, as late rhte kids get weapons and learn to use them by 'sucking souls'; yea I thought that was stupid too, is nill, they stand in one place and fire one or two shots, a blasto-rama did happen, off-screen, the annoying friend of James' Vander Der Beek's character gets creamed with a deputy, they were armed, the kids were armed, WHERE THE HELL WAS THE GUNFIRE AND SPATTERING BLOOD?! The characers are inane and repeatedly make decisions that do eventually get them killed, it at least made me take comfort in the fact that they got killed no matter how boring (or off camera) their deaths were. The cause is never revealed and the finale well, became psuedo-religious dribble and really made no sense and utterly failed to close out the story.

My final word on this crap, avoid it; if they show it on the sci-fi channel catch it if you're curious other than that don't you dare pay a penny for this, Clive Barker deserves to lose money on this garbage! His name's on it but he didn't write it.",1176508800,,1536,4.505376344086022
2608317,2,B000GFRI5O,"I really like Clive Barker movies, but this one isn't that great. It lacked in many areas and didn't explain much at all about what was going on. The movie ended and all I said was ""What?"". I thought I would watch the special features and deleted scenes for the hell of it. I learned quiet a bit about what the movie was suppose to be after watching the deleted scenes. I don't know what the director was thinking when he deleted all of those important scenes, but it did fill in a lot of spaces about the movie. I still felt like there was no punch or excitement to the movie though.  My guess would be is that this is another example of the director chopping and cutting the original writer's script and making a mess out if it. On the other hand, cutting all of those scenes could make for yet another DVD release being an ""uncut and unrated"" version. If you want suspense, I would advise you to pass on this one. If you want to see for curiosity sake, then rent it. I am very disappointed in this one.",1175990400,,1005,4.2072538860103625
