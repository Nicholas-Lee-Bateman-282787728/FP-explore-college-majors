8073479,3,B000A2WIGC,I bought every title in this series except 'mens' and 'couture' because the price was right.  Each contains a synopsis of each of the designers shows as listed. Good for archival storage since the DVD quality is good.  But where is Alexander McQueen?  He does not appear in ANY of the six or seven discs I viewed.  Wasn't he an important player?  Or is Big Brother rewriting history again?  What a shame.,1302739200,,404,4.541666666666667
