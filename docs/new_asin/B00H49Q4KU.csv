8629792,3,B00H49Q4KU,"Please be aware that (as opposite to part I) this is not a standard DVD format but an mp4. Unfortunately my PC (older model, but many folks still have those!) freezes hopelessly up trying to play this DVD ROM. So, as is now, it is useless for me. Check if your PC supports this format before purchasing.

That is a pity, because from the little I could watch before the system gave up, the content is very instructive and seemingly compliments Part I.
I would recommend that this would be re-published in standard DVD like Part I, or at least a format that is supported even by older PCs or devices, so that we all can enjoy end learn from it.",1437782400,,643,4.31404958677686

8629795,5,B00H49Q4KU,"I am not as experienced a mechanic or wheel builder as the first reviewer. I found this disc to be a great complement to the first installment of Master Wheelbuilding. I watched both of the discs in preparation for a wheel build class with Bill and they were invaluable as I went to class and was faced with a pile of parts, a raft of tools, and a truing stand. Fortunately for me, I was facing that pile of stuff with Bill's expert guidance close at hand. I felt very well prepared for the class and like I had a much better understanding of the overall process and some of the tricks and pitfalls that help or hinder a build. I highly recommend Master Wheelbuilding II for the close ups on the equipment and the graphics he uses to illustrate the concepts and process. It is great to be able to look more closely at the process.",1394409600,,830,4.292993630573249
8629796,5,B00H49Q4KU,"A complement building on Wheel Building 1, get them both if you haven't done this before. This is an opportunity to gain extensive wheel building knowledge from a Master Mechanic who is also master teacher - take it.  Bill has built thousands of wheels, he has an engineering mind and can make the seemingly complex not only easy to understand but make you want to learn more.  I have all of Bill Mould's mechanic DVD's, 2 years back that led me to his shop in Alexandria for a 2 day session on wheel building that I drove 12 hours to attend (I'd do it all over again). His style of teaching stays with you, almost anticipates your questions or rough spots; He helps you understand clearly and guide you around them. There has been no one else who comes close to providing this detail - you get not only the solid knowledge from Bill, but the nuances, tips and techniques in the process as well as tool ideas that would take us all at least 200 pairs of wheels or 200 bicycles repaired to learn. Bill is a pro, a gift to the Bicycle Mechanic world, and a gem of a person with high integrity and attention to detail. You will not he disappointed. About the reviewer, I am a Cat III/IV Masters level rider at 51 years young, member of the Florida Garneau Club and a student of the bike since 2001, Bill has so highly influenced me on being a better mechanic for my own bikes that I will be attending the 2 week BRO (Bicycle Repair and Operations) mechanics class at Barnett Bicycle Institue (BBI) coming up in February. Thank you for your generous mentoring and sharing your experience Bill.",1390953600,2,1589,4.419795221843003
