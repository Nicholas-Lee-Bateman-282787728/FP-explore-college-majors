8305743,2,B000HDRAQW,"Not the best of anything in this version, a poor translation and shallow offering. It's as if no one understands the words or emotions they are supposed to be portraying, including the director and translator. Susanna played by Rossana Potenza is overacting at its worst. Her exaggerated facial contortions and arm waving make it difficult to get through the first act. Particularly difficult to watch if you do historical reproduction, as the sets, props, and costumes all fall short to a critical eye. Hold out for a better version.",1290297600,3,534,5.01123595505618
8305744,5,B000HDRAQW,"Don't listen to all the nay-sayers. I don't care if this is your non-famous cast. I don't care if it doesn't have Bryn Terfel's paunchy face, Cecilia Bartoli's chaotic stage presence or any of the other household names of contemporary opera.

I'd seen them all - Gardiner, the Salzburg Fest, the Berlin State Opera versions, plus many live productions (granted, the best I can see here in the Pacific Northwest of the US), but I was still dissatisfied. It might not have always been the singing - in many cases the singers exceed the acting quality, or vice versa. Bryn Terfel and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's voices were very nice, but they were SO not ""Figaro"" (at least for me). At the very least, I wanted singers who knew how to act. There's only so long you can patiently watch singers, however beautiful their voices, stand dumbly on a stage, underact or overact by turns, be it too modern or too ""unlike the character.""

I'd gotten to the point where I believed every production would be sub-par, but I barreled forth with the idea that I'd find, somewhere, THE production that spoke loudest to me. Well, this was THAT production.

Traditionalists will still cling to Terfel, Dieskau and goodness knows who else, which is odd to me because those people do not truly exude the kind of youthful, mischievous, completely Mozartean aura that is so clearly evident in Mozart's music and words. Mozart's opera buffas (Don Giovanni and, to a lesser extent, Cosi Fan Tutte being the exceptions) are rompish, ingenious, against-the-odds with music that can turn from the divinely pure to the downright earthy.

I really LOVE this version. Why? Figaro, sung by Giovanni Furlanetto, is far more convincing (and slender) as the somewhat foolish, naive town factotum, and Susanna (Elzbieta Szymtka, a year or two more advanced in age than preferable) has just the right demure-but-not quality of a Susanna. The 20 or 30-something Count made a pleasant surprise, and he didn't sound or appear out of place. Marcellina, if anything, makes a young ""hag,"" Bartolo is the proper resentful physician, and Basilio is the little, paunchy, conniving con-man as befits his character. Cherubino was, well, Cherubino (in looks and risque acting). The Countess was the only character I kind of shook my head to, but I've become accustomed to her and even think perhaps her casting not such a bad idea after all, psychological/music-related things in the broader context considered.

The cons? The sound quality, in some scenes, is distant/foggy. In little portions, like that of Act 2, ""Signori di fuori,"" I could hardly hear the Count. The gowns for the Countess aren't the most outlandishly awesomely amazing (they were still okay, but not quite the noble ensembles I'd seen elswhere).

More pros: the stage design, costumes and overall taste for simple style is quite obvious. The stage is somewhat sparse in Act 2, the setting being in the Countess' bedroom (furnished more like a Spanish/French cottage), but in following acts the same French/Spanish themes are retained with a slew of believable props. Don't know about anyone else, but a sparse stage is a HUGE no-no in my book.

I really have no more words to say on this production. Judge the voices for yourself if you want (the voices, in my opinion, are beyond questioning), but the perfect precision of timed acting, singing, costumes, and everything is why I own this DVD. If you are too much of a Terfel or Dieskau lover, you may or may not like this version. But I strongly suggest you take the leap of faith with this one.",1284249600,3,3569,4.87953795379538
