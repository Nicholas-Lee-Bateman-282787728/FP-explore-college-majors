7296344,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"Bought this directly from Illustra Media, not Amazon. What most fascinated me was the presentation of dolphin sonar & the right whale reproductive system as examples of irreducible complexity. These systems require all the parts in place at one time before they can do anything useful at all. There's also a little discussion about the mathematical challenge faced by Darwinian mechanisms. I watched this with my 8-year old & it held her attention most of the way through, though it's not a kid's movie. Part of the reason might be the beautiful images, but the ideas presented are easily grasped as well",1441238400,4,604,4.931372549019608
7296345,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"This nearly 70-minute documentary explores the exquisite design found in dolphins, sea turtles, salmon, and whales. The segments on salmon and whales are especially outstanding. You will never think about the brains of salmon in the same way again; and you will never think about the evolution of whales in the same way. The production qualities are top-notch, just like a BBC production. This is a wonderful video to show to your friends as a discussion-starter. It's also a great video to show to your children or small group.",1437609600,7,528,4.943820224719101
7296346,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"A clear and rational presentation of evidence of design and the hand of a creator in nature.  Anyone who believes life could have come about by random chance needs to seriously consider the content of this program.  To say that the implications are huge is an understatement.  The best in a series of articulate, intelligent, well researched films from Illustra Media.",1437609600,10,368,5.0
7296347,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"Living Waters is the latest example of Illustramedia's excellence in media. Each documentary presents a facet on life on this planet with visual magnificence. Each one meets the most rigorous demands of scientific inquiry, leading beyond the limitations of materialistic explanations to suggest explanations that follow and fit the evidence, culminating in awe at the intelligence which must have produced it. They are more than just intellectually fulfilling. They make sense of the human longing for reason, purpose, and beauty. After watching several of these films, I am convinced that the Designer intended the earth not only to ""be inhabited"" but to be inhabited by other (necessarily lesser) intelligences and filled with ""natural laws"" and self-replicating species for the sole purpose of presenting puzzles and mysteries to those intelligences, to whet, challenge, and satisfy human curiosity.

We look forward to every DVD Illustra releases. We only wish they could release them more frequently (but not at the expense of quality)! We have already bought and shared this one with family and friends--our 11-year old granddaughter was especially delighted with the segment on turtles--and hope to invite more small groups in to watch it, plus, if possible, have it shown at church. If you're in the Long Beach, California, area, join us!",1437609600,13,1346,5.37914691943128

7296364,1,B00ZYSKLU2,"Anti-science, regressive, non sense. The makers of the film either have no understanding of natural selection or they intentionally lie to the audience to support their agenda. Natural selection is NOT random. It is a process in which traits are passed through genetic variation. Genetic traits that are preferable to a particular environment provide an increase probability for survival. Animals within a species who possess these traits tend to live on longer and reproduce where as the ones with less preferable traits tend to die off. After extremely long periods of time of passing down preferred traits, while the less preferred die off, new species will emerge. This process is simple and is COMPLETELY supported by the overwhelming evidence found in studies of cellular biology, anatomy, embryology, and the fossil record. What's truly offensive about this film is not only how toxic it is to society (children especially) but that the truth of life's origins are so much more wonderful than the dogmatic propaganda.",1451865600,7,1024,5.25

7296366,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"Excellent!

Illustra Media has produced some of the most compelling scientific films for Creation that I have ever seen.  The evidence is presented in a logical, non emotional yet compelling way.  These films including the newest ""Living Waters"" are very thought provoking films convincing films.

Highly recommended, well worth watching!",1450656000,,338,5.7
7296367,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"It brought up the ID-interest science from 4 different oceanic organisms:  Whale (singing, migration), Dolphin (sonar), Salmon(migration), Sea Turtle (migration).  Pretty fascinating.

Enjoyed it.  I liked the focus on ID, instead of what I have mostly watched--creation based. Just because.... if others are so disinclined to faith, at least a video like this hits the argument based on science only, leaving out a specific faith based position.  I mean gosh, the way this is presented I can't believe anyone has ever even believed in evolution.  It seems so logical that we are intelligently designed for meaning and purpose.  Evolution's story is so harsh and meaningless.  Richard Dawkins says ""That's just tough""... but really... is it even true?

7296369,5,B00ZYSKLU2,"Einstein famously wrote: ""Science without religion is lame, Religion without science is blind."" This video confims Einstein's comment.

Covers three species, Dolphins, sea turtles and salmon. Shows some of the fascinating abilities of each. Focuses on explaining, not preaching.

The dolphins sonar ability is covered in some detail. Computer animation makes the complex process easy to follow. From the clicks, to the sound waves that exit directly from the skull, to the receiver in the jaw, to the device that translates to pictures in the brain, it was clear and absolutely fascinating.

Sea turtles shown hatching and then traveling alone thousands of miles to live there for decades. How do they know where to go? Their ability to use planet's magnetic field is deftly presented. Then they return years later to breed in the same beach. Astounding!

Northwest salmon return to same small rivers after traveling thousands of miles. They also read magnetic fields. However, they also employ keen sense of smell to find the precise stream where born. A vivid computer animation drills down to the cellular level to demonstrate the process. Great!

This presentation highlights the science in a clear, very interesting way. Speakers express their opinion, that only a purposeful designer could do what we have seen here. This is not overdone. Lets the viewer reach his own conclusion.

Covers the miraculous changes that would be required to change a land animal into a whale. Highlights the incredible difference in the male reproductive system in a whale and land animal. Thought provoking. Compelling.

Considerable scientific analysis. Wonderful photography. Persuasive. Skilled. Effective.

Will watch many times with friends and family. Fabulous!",1446768000,2,1754,5.3992673992674

Once anyone pays attention to the complexity of creation of just the dolphin or the homing abilities of the sea turtle, they will begin to doubt the logic of Darwinism.

8721137,5,B00ZYSKLU2,I learned a lot of information through this DVD. The presentation of the oceans and the life therein was captivating. The facts of life in the ocean proves beyond any doubt that all creation has a intelligent designer ( for lack of stronger term) and the Bible is 100% accurate. I'm sharing it with all my friends.
