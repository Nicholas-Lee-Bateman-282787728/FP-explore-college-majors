A story told as seen by a pimp working for Boss himself hidding a secret to arrange cheap sex-workers to run a business -both cinematographical and pillow.

Things went bad as Chinese mafia interests were crossed-but the worse guys were punished and the pimp got an upper hand while multiculturalism rules!",1332892800,2,630,6.765432098765432
8501806,3,B006OALDII,"It seems almost paradoxically to have a story of a pimp who truly cares about the welfare of working girls he is responsible for. This film presents such a situation. It is a thriller genre movie with a mockumentary undertone. Woody the pimp, played by Robert Cavanah, is convincing and takes the viewer into the grubby world of prostitution and organised crime. The film has a decent introduction, a flabby middle, and a few surprises at the end.
