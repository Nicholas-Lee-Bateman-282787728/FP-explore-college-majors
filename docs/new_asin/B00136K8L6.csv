This was filmed at the Wanee Festival in LIve Oak, Florida in 2007. IT contains over 3 hours of music and interviews, you get to see the band members in a campground atmosphere, they even have late night jam sessions.

With this DVD, its almost just like being there. It's awesome. If you love Southern Rock &/or Jam bands, this is a paradise and a ""must-have"" dvd. I love mine, and I highly recommend this one!!!

I'm surprised Amazon had it!!! Thank you and may God Bless!!!",1233878400,3,746,4.767441860465116
