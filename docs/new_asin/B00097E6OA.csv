2269997,5,B00097E6OA,"Three great short stories! Humorous. Good messages. Two are geared for Christian audiences, one for unbelievers.
Filmed in the mid 80's, so a little dated, but still worth watching.",1277078400,6,181,5.275862068965517
2269998,4,B00097E6OA,"This is like watching a church youth production mini skits.  They are short and insightful and sends a good message across.  As far as entertainment, no.  But, as far as getting a point expressed as far as dating, ect...rock solid.  And since they were so short; it worked to our advantage of having my children watch them and then discuss.",1199664000,8,340,4.616666666666666
2269999,1,B00097E6OA,"don't be fooled.  This is NOT part of the TV series ""The Pretender"" starring Michael T. Wiess.  I ordered it believing it to be a TV movie of the series and turned out it isn't even close!  I wish someone had put in a warning before I ordered this DVD as I am now attempting to get a full refund due to the lack of good information on the item.",1155859200,28,344,3.8857142857142857
8058194,5,B00097E6OA,"This is the holy trinity of the Christiano brothers--perhaps the greatest Christian film makers of all time. In fact, there may be no trilogy in the history of film so powerful and majestic. After watching these films, not only will you be a Christian, but you will be at risk of heresy when you realize the Christiano Brothers are GODS--gods of film! The scores, like the songs of distant angels, sweep us to realms of Christian values and aesthetics previously unknown and indescribable to the ear; the cinematography reveals what must have been seen by the eyes of God when he first looked down upon creation; the acting portrays how truly the saints and sinners of the Gospel itself would have been witnessed by our eyes were we there; the writing is like that of the Bible itself, compiled of erudite wisdom, parable, and sprawling narrative, having many interpretations, being difficult to understand while also utterly perfect and never contradictory. Oh!, but what else can be said but this--that, yes, without a doubt, the Holy Spirit has descended like a dove upon the Christiano brothers, and we are their witnesses. Praise be!",1523404800,,1138,4.932291666666667
8058195,4,B00097E6OA,"These are great old Christian movies.  The ""Daylight Zone"" was filmed in a part of Texas where I lived, which brings me back to those memories.",1474848000,,143,4.5
8058196,4,B00097E6OA,"seemed pretty good. I mean I like Christian music and maybe books sometimes better than films, but they are still to be cherished even though they are few and not always the best..i still cherish them for Sabbath, they are still good to collect for watching on sundays to keep Sabbath holy and fun for that-this is kind of one of those classics wasn't too bad as far as Christian or any films for that matter goes..you know movies are always a bit dumb just how is..but watchable when in mood for sure with great points and everything you know that are very inspiring if let be",1467417600,,577,4.401869158878505
8058197,5,B00097E6OA,Great movies. Blessed be the name of the Lord,1439683200,,45,4.111111111111111
8058198,2,B00097E6OA,"'Pretty cheesy"" in my estimation. Kids today might think these three little stories are a bit ""under"" them.

I dunno - mebbe they were made years and years ago.",1424995200,,160,4.517241379310345
8058199,5,B00097E6OA,"This DVD is a triple treat;it has not only a movie on it that I've been dying to see for years(The Pretender),but also two other great movies as a special bonus;I highly recommend it.",1393718400,,183,4.411764705882353
8058200,5,B00097E6OA,"My family loves everything by the Christiano Brothers. They may be a little dated and corny at times, but it is much better viewing than what is available on TV these days.",1391126400,,172,4.40625
8058201,5,B00097E6OA,"Worth watching. Good short films that are funny and memorable.
I only spent a couple of dollars on it but definitely worth digging a little deeper into the wallet for. These aren't online anywhere.",1366588800,,197,4.823529411764706
8058202,5,B00097E6OA,I love this movie.  I bought it for my teenager.  It really helped her a lot in discerning who her true male friends were; especially when it comes to spiritual values!,1337558400,3,168,4.387096774193548
8058203,5,B00097E6OA,"the pretender is good. its about a lying nonbelieving boy who acts like hes a christian to get a christian girl. she falls for it. well, this is why you have to know Christ intimately and obey him. Flesh cant get in the way, or you will not see what God wants you to see. anyway, God protects her and she doesnt sleep with him, because of a friend that God used to help. so in the end, the jokes on the nonbeliever. he gets nothing and she gets knowledge about seeking the Lord before she gets into a relationship.
the daylight zone was an original way to get an athiest to believe God. it worked. pretty funny and encouraging. show this one to a non believing athiest. they may think twice about their foolishness. Jesus is still  Lord!",1300320000,4,737,4.302158273381295
