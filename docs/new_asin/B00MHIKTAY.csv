6577927,5,B00MHIKTAY,"It has been a long time since I had not seen an opera DVD in the traditional way, as the composer intended. This is a very beautiful performance of this important opera in terms of scenery, costumes and production. Sets are simple but effective. Dario Solari is excellent as Belisario and so is Donata D'Annunzio as Antonina. Bravo for Bergamo Musical Festival.",1413504000,15,361,4.838709677419355
6577928,5,B00MHIKTAY,"Belisario has a great story, even thought it has as usual much historical license from the real general from Byzantium. This production is modest in scale, but the costumes and sets fit the period. Many new production try to be novel and it is quite irritating. This production is truer to what Donizetti had in mind. The character of Belisario is played by Dario Solari, who has a great voice and he is a good actor. The other singers do not have voices that stand out as much as his. However, they are adequate and the acting is good. This is a very beautiful opera and I would recommend it if you like Donizetti's music or bell canto music in general. I am happy to have this in my library. It is an opera I would enjoy watching from time to time. This is an opera I would like to see done by the MET, if they can be true to the historical setting.",1413417600,23,851,4.195121951219512

8672336,1,B00MHIKTAY,"I don't understand the rave reviews.  The sound pickup was horrible; at the beginning of the opera, the off stage choir could not be heard.  We have several of Donizetti's operas done by this company and this is the first one we have had a complaint about.  The music is not up to his normal standards, the mike pick up of the sound is poor and uneven.  The staging feels wooden.  I highly recommend NOT buying it.  This is the view of both my husband, (played 25 years in SF Opera Orchestra), and myself.",1493510400,,505,4.319148936170213

8672338,2,B00MHIKTAY,"This production is not a good. The singing is bad. The colors of the setting is dull green, black and red and the lighting is red, not attractive at all.",1469491200,,153,4.133333333333334
8672339,5,B00MHIKTAY,"I saw this dvd when I checked for some operas that I did not know, I read very good reviews about it and decided to buy it.
I read that this opera was composed after Lucia di Lammemoor and it was performed very often at that time, and that the music was very good with a lot influence from his previous composition.
When I bought this dvd I only knew some of the Donizettis operas, not this one nor any of the members of this cast. I am glad to get this one.
The cast is very good: Donata DAnnunzio Lombardi who played Antonina has a powerful voice, the rest of singers were outstanding in their roles.
I loved the music, like everything written by Donizetti, the duets and trios were very beautiful in particular the ones between father and daughter and the trio when Alamiro lets Belisario know that he is the son that was lost long time ago .The chorus played an important role in this opera.
The scenery wasn't so elaborated, but the costumes and the light were very effective as well as the orchestra.
If anyone wants to be exposed to one of the Donizettis less known opera this is a good example as it is an outstanding production.",1451260800,4,1137,4.342723004694836

8672341,5,B00MHIKTAY,"In prior decades, Donizetti's Belisario was taken up by Gencer and Caballe, who unfortunately left only live audio recordings.
This is the first video available and offers fine singers, a tasteful, conservative staging, a well-composed, mature score and an intelligent and cohesive libretto.
The score is immediately engaging with arias and duets that are on a par those of Lucia di Lammermoor, written the same year. There are several arias for the soprano, but none with the bravura of the Mad Scene. With the overall quality of the composition here and the talented singers, I was wishing for extra arias for the other singers. Lesser-known operas are often brought forward as singers demand them, as with Gencer and Caballe, and that's all it would take again.
The sound is good clear stereo with enough ambience for surround to be synthesized, and I find that preferable to the mostly-mono-thru-the-center-channel sound that I find too often these days.
The singers are age appropriate and have fine, firm voices with enough nuance, even in the case of the secondary tenorino of the villain of the piece. Donizetti uses complex rhythms in his accompaniments which give them special energy, and there are no areas where the energy seems to flag, an impression I have from some of his lesser operas.
I saw positive comments on this DVD and I'm glad I went ahead and bought it. It has earned a place on my shelf.",1425945600,12,1414,4.895833333333333
8672342,5,B00MHIKTAY,"Belisario is an almost forgotten opera score of Donizetti that was premiered in 1836 at La Fenice in Venice. It was quite popular for many years after its introduction especially it's extended tessitura for dramatic soprano as the evil wife who destroys her husband, an revered historical figure.
Donizetti was midway in his career so that after the death of Bellini (1835) till the rise of Verdi after his Nabucco, he was the dominant figure in Italian opera. Of his nearly 70 operas, Belisario is about halfway in his completed ouvre, coming right after the very successful Lucia di Lammermoor. Whereas Lucia was more of a ""bourgeois"" subject (a commoner) there was a vogue in the Italy of the mid- 1800s in dramas, books and operas for historical, edifying, exemplary, noble subjects from antiquity: Biblical, Roman, late Roman and Greek history - especially strong women. So we had a rash of Vestals, Medeas, Saffos and a Norma. Thus when the librettist Cammerano presented Donizetti with a libretto transcribed from Cammerano's own popular play, the composer readily accepted. It is about a famous heroic general of the Byzantine Kingdom under Justinian. A lost son is found, an evil wife causes a heroic leader to be blinded and later is remorseful but dies  without being forgiven so she is bound for Avernus (Hell)., a juicy plot for an opera. The entire score was written in great haste (Donizetti always had more contracts than he could handle) but was well received and greatly applauded on it's introduction. After a popular round playing at many Italian opera houses for several years it then completely disappeared. It was recently revived at the Bergamo Festival and we are thankful for their efforts.
The music is full blown Donizetti. The prelude ""sinfonia"" is lively with hints of themes from the score, The various characters are well drawn and the action is fast-paced - good examples of Donizetti' art; no longueurs here. Of particular note is the scena and duet at the end of act 2 between the now blinded and ostracized Belisario and his daughter Irene who has become his guide. It is truly beautiful and poignant and does not fail to evoke a tear even after several listenings.
The production is an ""economy"" design by the Bergamo Opera Festival but at least it wasn't a Eurotrash design that has ruined so many presentations of operas by Rameau, Handel etc. Here the sets were minimal but effective, the chorus was first rate and the stage action just right. The one singer of stature is Dario Solari as Belisario. He has a rich commanding voice and a good dramatic sense. The ""evil woman"" was barely adequate. The rest of the cast were competent,
This opera is truly a worthy addition to the recorded list of Donizetti works. I thank the Bergamo Opera Festival for it's excellent work.",1425254400,13,2811,4.8684759916492695
