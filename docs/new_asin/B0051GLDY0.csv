4521547,1,B0051GLDY0,"Am I the first to have the cowhindas to to tell the truth. Every review on here has to be from someone affiliated with the film.
it is a total piece of slow crap. Should pay me $25 to watch.",1331596800,3,190,3.775
4521548,5,B0051GLDY0,"it is a beautiful film, skillfully executed. Christopher Thornton is a revelation! Lewis is purely authentic, as usual; Bloom carries off one of the most intense characters, in the most beautifully perfect way, ever.",1317859200,2,216,5.382352941176471
4521549,5,B0051GLDY0,"This movie is gritty and harsh and yet also beautiful.  It explores fascinating themes about how grace might work and the ways that human beings try to manipulate and buy one another.  Great performances from some wonderful actors.  I'm new to Christopher Thornton, but was so impressed that I'll have to look at what else he's been in.  It is absolutely a movie worth watching.",1315958400,5,378,4.769230769230769
4521550,5,B0051GLDY0,"A powerful magical realism exploration of the power of healing. Chris Thornton wrote an amazing story here! While the plot centers on a paraplegic struggling with his disability, the themes are universal. After his accident, Dwyer faces alienation, limitations, fear and anger as he watches his life slide into desperation. After discovering he has the power to heal, he's exploited by those he once relied on. In an attempt to regain what he's lost, he sells his soul and his gift to rock stardom. In the end, he learns healing is not about walking again, but is instead a complicated internal process... a very intense journey that leaves you thinking...

On a side note... as a paraplegic, I get sick of able-bodied actors playing disabled roles. Thank you Chris!",1315353600,10,766,4.937984496124031
4521551,5,B0051GLDY0,"A friend recommended this and I went into the film with no knowledge of it at all. I came away incredibly impressed. Like the magical realism of authors such as Gabriel Garca Mrquez, Sympathy takes us on a mystical journey of near-destruction and ultimate redemption. Dean O'Dwyer, living on skid row destitute and desperate, wakes up one day to discover he has the ability to heal. When he also discovers he cannot heal his own spinal cord injury, he decides instead to cash in. His journey is troubling, tragic, and harsh as he learns what it really means to heal. One of the most powerful aspects of this film is actor Christopher Thornton. A gifted actor, he also wrote the script for this film. It was refreshing to see a disabled actor playing the role of a disabled character. This is rare in Hollywood and Thornton's writing and acting brought a necessary realism to the film. I loved it!",1315353600,,896,4.6415094339622645
4521552,4,B0051GLDY0,"This movie was better than expected.  Good acting, interesting script, kept my attention all the way through.  Better than some of the top 10 movies.",1313798400,,149,4.92
4521553,3,B0051GLDY0,"""Listen please, you don't know what you did, you got the healing touch.""  After being shown the power of faith healing, Delicious decides to use what he has learned to become a world famous DJ.  When fate steps in and allows him to heal everyone's problems but his own he must decide if he will use his gift for someone else.  This is not a bad movie at all.  Without being in your face with it, this is a fairly religious movie.  This also presents a great question.  If you had the power to help everyone but yourself could you do it or would you be to jealous?  Great acting by everyone makes this an enjoyable movie to watch.  Orlando Bloom is great in a wide departure from what he usually does.  The fact that the lead actor is actually paralized gives his performance a dimension that would be lacking if the actor was only pretending.  This is a pretty slow moving movie, but very much worth watching.  Overall, a very good movie filled with great acting.  This is another movie you must be in the mood for though.  I liked it.  I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would",1313712000,,1098,4.236714975845411
4521554,5,B0051GLDY0,"SYMPATHY FOR DELICIOUS is well worth watching in theaters, on demand for television, or DVD.  The story addresses several tough issues - the plight of the homeless on skid row, the lack of support for disabled persons, the arena of faith healing, and the at times crumbling dreams and realities of rock bands. The film was written by Christopher Thornton who suffered spinal cord injury in 1992 resulting in his being a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair: he has over come his disability by becoming a much lauded stage actor (the first to play Hamlet in a wheelchair, etc): Thornton also stars in this film and his performance introduces an actor of exceptional virtuosity. Mark Ruffalo directs his first film and also stars as one of the lead characters.

'Delicious' Dean O'Dwyer (Christopher Thornton) is a DJ on the rise in Los Angeles whose career is devastated by a motorcycle accident leaving him confined to a wheelchair, living in a car on skid row. He is part of the people cared for by Father Joe Roselli (Mark Ruffalo) who recognizes a life worth saving and turns his attention to Dean, attempting to restore his ability to walk by taking him to a faith healing revival lead by Healer (John Carroll Lynch). Though Dean is not healed himself he does happen to touch one of his fellow skid row dwellers who is subsequently miraculously healed. One of Dean's friends, Rene (Noah Emmerich) discovers Dean's powers and pleads with him to heal fellow paraplegic Rene. Dean does not believe in his power of faith healing (he is frustrated that he cannot heal himself!) and continues to search for a place where he can return to being a performing DJ.

Dean meets bass player Ariel Lee (Juliette Lewis, in a stunning star turn) who is convinced Dean should join a forming band composed of The Stain (Orlando Bloom), Ariel, and Oogie (Dov Tiefenbach). While the rasty band recognizes Dean's talent as a possible addition to the band, the band's PR person Nina Hogue (Laura Linney) will have none of it. it is only when Dean's healing powers surface that the band - and Nina - want him to give them an image that will make them famous. Dean is discouraged by Father Joe, pleading with him to remain at skid row performing his healing so that Father Joe will increase donations to his charity care house. Conflicts arise, incidents occur with the band and at skid row and Dean's place in all of this new fame is altered: money seems to be the driver that destroys many people and gets in the way of the true value of Dean's healing gift.

The film is strong on many levels - especially the acting (except for Orlando Bloom who overwhelms the story in the wrong way) - and as a first film to be directed by the very gifted Mark Ruffalo it holds promise of works to come. Christopher Thornton is not only a fine writer and actor, but his screen presence is so powerful that it is likely he will become as major a star on film as he is on stage.

4521555,3,B0051GLDY0,"I can't say this was a great movie, but it was a good movie.  Again good actors can sometimes elevate bad writing.  Worth a look",1402704000,,128,4.08
4521556,3,B0051GLDY0,It is an ok movie. I liked the story. I liked it so much that I gave it to my brother.,1394236800,,86,3.142857142857143
4521557,3,B0051GLDY0,"Unreal story. Boring . Depressing, though... But my deepest sympathy to Christopher and once again again I had a chance to admire Mark as a person. He is not just an actor but a real friend and wonderful man.",1386979200,,208,4.358974358974359
4521558,5,B0051GLDY0,"I saw this movie and got it only because I am a huge Mark Ruffalo fan and I was curious to see his directorial debut. It was fantastic and I really liked the spiritual storyline. Some of the performances were a bit over the top, but I didn't lose interest and most of the characters were very believable. The ending gave me chills and was a bit of a twist but not entirely unpredictable. A really great first effort in directing by an actor I absolutely love to watch in performance.",1373673600,,483,4.318681318681318
4521559,3,B0051GLDY0,I think the movie strayed quite a bit from the true story but can't say for sure. Too much of the F word for me... like every other breath and it is rather vile how this healing gift was supposedly given to someone who wasn't even a believer and then .... you might say prostitued for money... yet in the end I guess he got his attitude right anyway. Kind of wierd.,1365724800,,365,4.083333333333333
4521560,5,B0051GLDY0,"The backsttory for this movie is as good as the movie. It is not autobiographical but the star of the movie wrote it plus he is truly paralyzed. A lot is said here about poverty, bias, homelessness, organized religion.",1364688000,,218,4.615384615384615
4521561,5,B0051GLDY0,"Truly gives an inside view into a man witha spiritual responsibility, who does not yet realize his gift to others!!",1362355200,,115,4.8
4521562,4,B0051GLDY0,"I really was surprised by quality of this movie.  The acting was outstanding (not surprising considering the very talented cast), and the plot was better than expected - the pace was tight, and though the story was somewhat predictable, there were still some unexpected twists.  Well worth buying.",1359936000,,297,5.166666666666667
4521563,3,B0051GLDY0,Received sympathy today and i watched it immediately have to say i thought it was a very good film although i had never heard nor seen it before i found i really liked this movie especially the end shot with Christopher Thornton wheeling down the street. My thanks to all the reviewers who told me a little something about the film prior to my purchase without your so-called *spoilers* i never would have purchased this film but after reading what the film was about i was more than sure i would like it and i did so i owe all of you a big THANK YOU!!!Also being a huge Orlando Bloom fan i have to say it was very refreshing to see him portray a totally different character complete with his beautiful British accent. I do not know much about Christopher Thornton but i think his acting was excellent and i will be looking for more movies in which he is in. Lastly i loved the song played at the end of the movie. The only reason why i gave it only 3 stars instead of 5 is because although i did enjoy this movie it moved at a slower pace than i generally like my movies to go also the ending did not seem exactly realistic to me what did they forget about one convict?Nevertheless in my opinion this is a movie worth seeing even if you only watch it once.,1337385600,,1257,4.198347107438017
4521564,3,B0051GLDY0,"I tried to give this idea a chance, faith healing rock band, and with such a great cast was impressed at the get go.... I followed the script down a rabbit hole and found it engaging but somewhere lost my interest as many elements fell apart... Truthfully I started my doubts when $1500/mo living expenses were not enough on Skid Row.... r ya kidding me??? that's a freakin mortgage payment, no roomates or favors from the healed????... so started to pick apart the overacting by Orlando, Laura, and Julia, so unworthy performances although Orlando needs a serious vehicle for this type of acting... he was incredible but in the wrong time zone... the basic premise is: Do you know your place?  I never thought that was the right question and faltered miserably in the answer. Mark should do well when he trusts his own instincts more vs his dear friends.",1334966400,2,855,4.7
8452637,5,B0051GLDY0,"I like how it broke down stereotypes, how we get what we need - not what we want. How would life be different on this planet if we just focus on need and not fantasy and illusion?",1527033600,,179,3.864864864864865
8452638,5,B0051GLDY0,"This was a beautiful power film and all three star bloom, Lewis, and linney was superb.",1506729600,,87,4.5

8452640,5,B0051GLDY0,Loved this movie!!,1466121600,,18,5.333333333333333
8452641,4,B0051GLDY0,"Kudos to Mark Ruffalo for taking on this project.  Very nicely done of a touchy subject, what if one is given a gift like prophecy, or in this case healing, and one has not Love.  How it can all go wrong all the while one is doing great things for the suffering.  Mark is in it as a flawed priest and does a very good job, he is one of the top actors we have today.  Orlando Bloom and Laura Linney give very fine turns of very unlikable characters.  Juliette Lewis is fine also.
Is it God or the Devil, that will be in many peoples minds?",1450828800,,538,3.9906542056074765
8452642,2,B0051GLDY0,"This was physically painful to watch. Despite the seemingly spiritual tone I didn't observe one single human connection in the entire film. Many life-changing events take place but no detail into anyone's life. And there is a lot of ""churchy"" language used by characters who clearly have no idea into what power they're dealing. We get not even a glimpse into the character Ariel's life yet her actions reveal a very disturbed person. There is absolutely ZERO character development in this film. That's probably the main thing that killed it for me--it felt like we were let in the theater 15 mins late and we have no idea who anyone is.

It's a good thing Mark Ruffalo had Dr. Bruce Banner in his future. His directing talents leave much to be desired.",1448150400,,753,4.704545454545454
8452643,5,B0051GLDY0,I got this movie from Netflix and had to buy it. This version has bonus features including the story behind the story which is a must see (I recommend after watching the movie - AMAZING!).,1437609600,,188,4.4
8452644,5,B0051GLDY0,I like this story. Good cast too.,1428710400,,33,3.857142857142857
8452645,5,B0051GLDY0,Idiosyncratically thoughtful and deeply felt film that takes the non-beaten path. Very rewarding for those who with the heart and soul to to appreciate the journey.,1417478400,,164,5.346153846153846
