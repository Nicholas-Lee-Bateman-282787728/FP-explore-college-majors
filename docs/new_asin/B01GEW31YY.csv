7759444,5,B01GEW31YY,"BEHOLD! THE ONLY THING GREATER THAN THE FIRST ONE! By  Tina in Media PA  on July 18, 2016
Format: DVD
Loved, Loved, Loved this version of ""Roots"" I was a very big fan of the first one done 30 years ago. I was shocked to say the least that the were remaking it. I was watching the wonderful TV series ""Underground"" and a commercial for the remake of ""Roots"" came on. I almost flipped. I was so surprised that they would remake it. I knew I would be watching it, but was scared that it would not live up to the first one. Watched in it's entirety. Loved it! Now I understand why it would hold the newer generation's attention. I thought I would be bored with the African part, but nooooo! It was so well done and not bored at all. I fell in love with so many characters. I really appreciate the fact that some of the main characters were from Africa and how important the film became to them. Just wonderful! Waiting patiently to buy it so I can watch it commercial free. They change some of the storylines which still worked for me. Still love them both. I own the original and will own this one as well. It has to be part of my DVD collection. By the way this move was version involved a lot of people who were in volved in the original. thke was approve by evevyon",1470182400,,1265,4.159183673469387
7759445,2,B01GEW31YY,"You know,  I actually am very disgusted with a lot of these great ratings and reviews for this crap  which kills the whole vision and authentic feel from an African American perspective that this farce of a fantasy has been compared to the Supreme masterpiece in the ORIGINAL  Roots from '77 has been tweaked, tweaked,  twisted and butchered to satisfy the current appetite of society for scandal and violence.  It's very rushed and way too much time was spent on the life of Chicken
George than Kunta and Fiddler and Kizzy.  The conflict created thru George and his eldest son Tom was WACK and the omission of the poor white George was terrible to cutcut.  The relationship with Kunta and the wrestler was key before capture but cut. They turned Roots into an After school special.  Terrible remake.  I hated the idea of them tampering with this classic.  What if someone from another genre who chose not to remake a classic in the view of the people it's focused on,  remade something like Schindlers List but butchered it and tweaked all the names and passed it off as acceptable to the people and culture.  There would be an uproar and it would never air again.",1467936000,6,1165,4.6292682926829265
7759446,3,B01GEW31YY,"this new ""Roots"" should have been titled something else.  They polished it up for the 21st century like a modern movie, but the message doesn't come through nearly as much as the original.  It's based on the original, but they soft pedaled way too much of the psychological damage by cutting scenes to shorten the series from the original.  They also tried very hard to take away responsibility from certain european groups by depicting Africans as selling each other, eliminating the white capture of slaves.  They also made a point to make poor whites seem sympathetic by pitting them against the upper class and british, although they were the primary physical abusers of slaves.",1465948800,4,682,4.956140350877193
7759447,5,B01GEW31YY,"This mini series is unbelievable. The acting, especially two of the main actors who are starring in their first film, is top notch, full of visceral, raw emotion. The story plays out seamlessly, and is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It is hard to watch but so important for us to remember. The bonds of family, the importance of culture and heritage, the resilience of the human spirit, this movie has it all. I wish it were required viewing for all college students, I wept several times during the film and was on the edge of my seat, captivated, throughout all four parts. Please watch, you will not be disappointed.",1465689600,3,622,4.715596330275229

7759449,1,B01GEW31YY,"One of the worst miniseries I've seen. Completely heartless. The original was about a family and the ties that allowed them to survive horrible circumstances and racism that confronted their survival over the growth of the nation. The actors in the ""reimagining"" were better mostly, but wasted. The story in the original was better in the original. 12 years a slave was a much better, more realistic depiction of the brutality and survival in that time period. The new series was more interested in presenting the Haley family as fighting against everything and everybody in the south and racism.",1465430400,8,596,5.03030303030303
7759450,5,B01GEW31YY,"If you saw the first series, then you'll love the second. Roots transcends color lines and invigorates us with a deep understanding of the beauty of family.  Well acted and presented with a modern feel and interpretation. This series unfolds the hidden truths that's never really totally explain in mainstream American History.  Roots is simply exceptional !!!",1465344000,6,360,5.298245614035087

7759470,5,B01GEW31YY,"WHY CREATE a remake of one of the most powerful miniseries in history?

I had watched the first one about two years prior and I was still affected by it. My first response was Why are they doing it again? Malachi Kirby asks what we all want to know in an interview from Entertainment Weekly. Kirby plays Kunta Kinte, an iconic American role if ever there was, originated by LeVar Burton.

[There] was a resistance actually to producing this new version, executive producer Mark Wolper responds. It wasn't until Wolper made his unwilling 16-year-old son watch the original that he knew an update was in order. His son understood the series importance, it just didn't speak to him, Wolper explains.

The difference between the first and this new four-part, eight-hour series based on Alex Haleys book about his ancestors, is like day and night. In 1977, viewers were first introduced to American history told from the experience of black slaves. What an eye-opener. But, while the series was a revelation, it still pandered to a white audience.

The original slave ship captain was troubled by a guilty conscience. Not so the man in the 2016 update. Most ships don't have artillery that faces inward, but they would have those on a slave ship, says John Thornton, director of African American Studies at Boston University.
Those cannon are seen and used in the updated Roots, which takes its cue from better-informed studies of history and society. This is information we didn't know  and weren't prepared for in 1977. The lone extra from the Lionsgate/History Channel presentation, Roots: A History Revealed, explores this using footage from the series.

Before the international slave trade, the Europeans feelings about Africans were that Africans looked different  they were black  but they were equal, Nwando Achebe, professor of History, Michigan State University, explains. The Atlantic slave trade era changed that.
Sugar plantations in the 1400s required cheap labor. You couldn't pay [laborers] because you wouldnt get as much money, Jennifer L. Morgan, professor of History, New York University, clarifies.

So the viewpoint on Africans changed. You cannot think of the people you are enslaving and will be treating the way you plan on treating them as human beings, Achebe says. So that is where you have the switch from this belief that Africans were equal but different to Oh, they're cannibals, they're barbarians and we need to save their souls.

Africans were dehumanized. Slavery justified all manner of horrible behavior, Morgan says.

And thats the more authentic history of Roots 2016. There may be beatings, rapes and a horrible whipping; women give birth, men and women are hanged, but visuals are not sensationalized. There are lines Wolper and the producers don't cross. Not because they're afraid of their material, but because they want to keep viewers deep in the heart of Haleys story. Dont expect HBO excess.

It [is] one of the most respectful and ambitious portrayals of African history, says Reg-Jean Page (Chicken George) in a Good Morning America interview.

Kunta Kintes struggle to keep his identity after being renamed Toby has never been more powerful. So is the story of his daughter, Kizzy, played by Anika Noni Rose. She is sold to and raped by Tom Lea (Jonathan Rhys Davies), a farmer whose vices  alcohol and gambling  keep him poor. Kizzy has a son, Chicken George, enslaved by his own father then sold to an Englishman to cover a bad debt  after Lea promised the young man his freedom.

I accepted it from the moment I got there that I would be the villain, Davis says in the GMA interview. I had to be as brutal as I could possibly be, otherwise I would be dishonest and disrespectful to the material.

The 1080p picture looks great, full of natural color, fine detail and depth. Cinematography is by Sharone Meir (Whiplash), who filmed Part 1, and Peter Menzies Jr. (Die Hard with a Vengeance). They bring a cinematic appearance to the series using a wide blend of color with the occasional pop  especially blue  and through natural light and expert framing. A 5.1 soundtrack provides a good, immersive experience with clear dialogue, ambient and effects sound. Dialogue is multi-lingual with subtitles. English SDH and Spanish subtitles are also available.

As noted, there is only one bonus feature. It's great but I wish there were more, such as interviews with the creative team and cast. Roots 2016 has been Emmy nominated for outstanding limited series; outstanding cast for a limited series, movie or special; and outstanding narrator for Laurence Fishburne, who plays Alex Haley.

The updated Roots cant match the impact of the first. But its story about the importance of family, history, and the resilience of the human spirit is as inspiring as ever. I don't often cry during a scene, but ""Roots"" touched my heart. Dont miss it.   Kay Reynolds",1471824000,5,4900,4.97671568627451
