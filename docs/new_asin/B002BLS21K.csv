8361629,5,B002BLS21K,"Padre Vieira's life spans the entire 17th Century. As a priest, Writer, Diplomat, Ambassador, incredible Preacher and Political Strategist for the Empire of Portugal, he helped to sign the treaty with the Dutch in order to free the Brazilian colony of their presence. The movie, by Manoel de Oliveira, was presented first time in the US at Yale University, and the oldest director in the World, still directing at that time, who was 93 years old, and presented his own creation (present, also, was his lovely wife). The movie shows Padre Vieira in all his facets, using as the film script, original historic documents left about or by Padre Vieira. It is a combination of languages: Portuguese, English, Italian, French and Dutch, that was mastered with all fluency by Vieira's impressive memory and knowledge that only Padre Vieira could amass. Several actors take his play in Vieira's different stages of life. It is a great tool to see the rise and fall of a personality entangled in the backstabbing of the clergy and the royal courts of Europe. It is a superb film that should be more available for the understanding/discussing of the role of the Church, Empire expansion and maintenance, and the historic presence of the Portuguese in the world. - Jordano Quaglia",1322611200,2,1269,4.934579439252336
