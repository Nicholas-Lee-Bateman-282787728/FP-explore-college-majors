7920956,3,B00004RFE5,"I want to specify first that I think these WrestleMania's are great.  I have no problems at all with the actual events.  However, this boxed set is lacking.
First of all, the tapes are all in EP.  This means that the picture quality is not as good, and the tapes will deteriorate quicker in the long run than if they were released in SP like most other commercially released tapes.
Another problem with these tapes is the editing they did to each event.  They had to put the new ""attitude"" logo at the bottom of the screen, and at times black out the old WWF logo which it would have overlapped with.  That's only a small complaint, but it gets worse.  They edited these videos heavily.  There are times when you will see huge cuts in the film where they forwarded things (take WM XII for instance.  Piper is in the ring celebrating.  All of a sudden, his song is at a different point, and his kid is in the ring with him).
They even went so far as to cut a FULL HOUR of footage from WrestleMania IV.  That wasn't the biggest problem though.  My WM IV tape didn't even work!
Overall I would not buy this set.  I would pick up the boxed set that Coliseum Video released after WrestleMania XIII.  Sure you get only 13 WM's, but they are in SP, of better quality, and not cut!",1075507200,4,1273,4.254166666666666
7920957,5,B00004RFE5,"While not a big fan of the ""WWF Attitude"" box set, the bottom line is that A) It's cheaper than the original retail price of the original new releases (check out the original pre-views, hit a rental store, or look at old wrestling magazines for more info if you don't believe, but these tapes cost as much as one PPV TODAY ($39.95 for WM IV alone!).  Yes, it's over $100, and almost $200, but divide that cost by 14-15 tapes, and the resulting figure is quite nice.  Now, consider buying each tape individually at $10 a tape, or even $8 a tape an compare the difference.  I promise it is significant.  ESCPECIALLY if you are looking for the Coliseum video version, which can run anywhere from $20-80 each, depending on the seller.  There are slight differences and edits in the footage on each different version of WM, but it's always nice to be able to get a collection of items all at one time, and at a discounted price.  Recommended.",1075334400,,937,4.482352941176471
7920958,5,B00004RFE5,"This is a great way to start a collection.  The first 15 WrestleManias, from the Hulkamania era all the way to the Attitude era.  If you ever dreamed of owning EVERY WrestleMania on video, this box set is a good way to start.  It's much cheaper than buying all of them one by one. ;)",1041292800,2,283,4.109090909090909
7920959,5,B00004RFE5,"If you're sitting there, staring at the price (which is lower than when I bought it a year ago, darnit.), and attempting to remember what happened at each WrestleMania to know if you really want to buy it. . . STOP! I felt the same way. It's a lot of money if you don't have much. But, just think. In thirty years, you can say you purchased the first fifteen WrestleManias.... You can bet you won't be able to do that then. Classic moments, memories, superstars, and celebs. It's all here folks.  The granddaddy of them all. The greatest spectecal on earth. The showcase of the Immortals. This is WrestleMania.",1012780800,2,610,4.545454545454546

7920961,5,B00004RFE5,"WOW!!  It's all I can say.  I just purchased this set last week and had just finished watching the last tape.  And believe me, I am in awe.
Now for those of you nostalgia buffs out there, you are going to love this!!  Wrestlemania 1 through 15 are contained in this box set and believe me, no stone is left unturned!
Every tape is uncut and features the original opening of each Wrestlemania.  All of the interviews are here, as well as clips leading up to most matches (which definitely made me take a trip down memory lane).
I read a review from someone saying that these tapes were edited.  Believe me when I tell you this, THEY ARE NOT.  Every waking moment from each Wrestlemania has been preserved in these cassettes.  These tapes are so in-depth, even the merchandising commercials are contained on some of them!  And in Wrestlemania V, they showed a commercial during the show containing Hulk Hogan's new movie (at the time), 'No Holds Barred'.  Now if they were going to edit these tapes, you'd think they'd take stuff like this out.
You'll see all the special guests from each era, including Muhammad Ali, 'Mr. Baseball' Bob Ucker, Vanna White, Mary Hart, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Cyndi Lauper, etc.  It's all here!!!
The one (and only) beef I have with this set is the playback mode.  The WWF produced this tapes in EP (extended play) mode, thus the quality isn't as good as it could be.  But I do believe if they sold these tapes in normal SP mode, the price of this set would have easily been doubled.
Relive your favourite moments in WWF history with this box set.  It is beyond the shadow of a doubt the best thing I own!
From the days of HULKAMANIA to the WWF's current 'attitude', you will love this set.",986169600,13,1725,4.487179487179487
7920962,5,B00004RFE5,"Despite the advent of monthly pay-per-view cards, WrestleMania remains the focal point of the WWF calendar.  This box set is an excellent library not only for completing one's wrestling video collection, but lending a sense of perspective in how wrestling has changed over the last 15 years.  From Hulk Hogan and Mr. T to Shawn Michaels, Steve Austin and The Rock, any wrestling fan would love this set.",984960000,2,403,4.911764705882353
7920963,5,B00004RFE5,"There are a couple reasons why I enjoyed purchasing this jam packed set of 15 videos!  First, it helps those who have missed the Wrestlemania's to finally see that infamous Ladder Match between HBk and ""The Bad Guy"" Razor Ramon, and also see The Mega Powers Explode!  Also, it helps those who do not remember the Wrestlemania's to re-live the amazing events.  After watching this collection, you can brag to your friends that you own every single Wrestlemania!  Actually, they'll probably point and laugh at you but it does not matter!  Why? Because you own every Wrestlemania!  Give yourself a pat on the back.  Moving on.  The next reason is to know the history so that you can relate it to today and laugh at how fake it was then, but hyow much it sucks now.  Why would you buy each WrestleMania individually?  It will cost you over 200 bucks!  But the WWF thought about their customers again, and they invented a box...so that you can put the tapes in.  In conclusion, i will summarize each WrestleMania for you nice people.
WRESTLEMANIA I Not bad...for the first one.  15 grand body slam match between Studd and Andre da Giant.  Hogan and Mr. T vs. Ordorff and piper.  Woman title on the line as well.
WRESTLEMANIA II NFL/WWF Battle Royal in chicago plus other matches... Boxing Match between Mr. T and Piper at Nassau Coliseum in NY! plus other matches... Hogan vs KKBundy in a cage for the title in LA!Plus other matches
WRESTLEMANIA III Big match was Hogan vs. Andre the Giant...A key match for WWF history.

WRESTLEMANIA V Lcated at Trump Plaza, the Mega Powers Explode!(Hogan and Savage of course) Plus other matches...
WRESTLEMANIA VI Hogan and Warrior battle it out in one of the best matches in WWF History.
WRESTLEMANIA VII What a scenario...during the middle of the confrontation with Iraq or Iran(i can never remember those countries).  Sgt. Slaughter was a great actor in this match against Hulk Hogan!
WRESTLEMANIA VIII Two Main Events!  Hogan tries to demolish the ""PSYCO""(SID), while Ric Flair defends his title against Macho Man Randy Savage!
WRESTLEMANIA IX The Title on the line not once, but twice!  Three men involved in this scene:Yokozuna, Bret Hart, and Hulk Hogan!
WRESTLEMANIA X GREATEST WRESTLEMANIA in my mind of all time!  From Bret Hart vs. Owen; Razor vs. HBK in an excellent Ladder match for INC Title!  also, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, and Yokozuna face off in two seperate matches for the WWF Title!  Savage takes on crush in a falls count anywhere match!  I canot stop watching this tape.
WRESTLEMANIA XI Nothing big...Lawrence Taylor takes on Bam Bam Bigelow, and HBK goes for the title against ""Big Daddy Cool"" Diesel!
WRESTLEMANIA XII Called ""The Night of the IRONMEN"", this PPV has it all.  From a Piper vs. Goldust in a Hollywood Backlot Brawl to Bret hart vs. HBK in an Ironman match!!  GREAT MATCH!
WRESTLEMANIA XIII Feel the HEAT!  Undertaker vs. Goldust for the World Title! Also, Submission match between SCSA(Stone Cold Steve Austin) and Bret Hart with Ken Shamrock as guest referee!  What an outcome!
WRESTLEMANIA XIV Mike Tyson serves as the Special Enforcer at the WWF Title Match between HBK and Austin!  Also, see HH vs. Owen Hart, and a Dumpster Match which set the stages the next night for the formation of the NEW DX.
WRESTLEMANIA XV The Ragin' Climax!  I was surprised when i watched it, but it was great!  ""The Bhrama Bull"" takes on ""The Rattlesnake"" for the WWF Title!!  Also, Kane vs. HHH!  and the other titles are on the line!
