1063205,2,6305745358,"This is a low budget action movie that didn't quite come together.  Cynthia Rothrock kicked booty as usual, but Fred Williamson and his character are unmemorable.  The supposed budding romance between the  Rothrock and Williamson characters lacked chemistry and thankfully there  was no sex scene to strain credibility further.  The plot is better than  the usual martial arts movie, and this movie tries hard to be more than a  kick-flick (the recovering alcoholic subplot comes to mind) but the overall  story was not compelling.
This movie is worth renting for Rothrock's  martial arts skills, but it is not worth owning unless you can find it in  the bargain bin.",961113600,,667,5.036697247706422

1063329,2,6305745358,"This film's only appeal was Cynthia Rothrock, however the director did her a great injustice.  Rothrock normally displays her phenomenal martial arts skills with great fight scenes, but here the director made Fred Williamson look more unbeatable, and Rothrock more vulnerable.  This is NOT what we come to see in any film Rothrock is in.  It was easy to tell that she herself struggled to look like a character that wasn't much of a fighter.  Cybthia is one of the BEST screen fighters in the action film business, and has always played ass-kicking and sexy characters.  This was a disgrace to her reputation.  This film could have been so much better if Rothrock was used properly.  Nonetheless Rothrock has, and will always be one my favorite martial artists in film.",1373500800,2,769,4.869230769230769

1063331,2,6305745358,"When the King of Blaxploitation Fred Williamson, the Hong Kong Action Queen Cynthia Rothrock, and Oscar nominee Robert Forster got together to make a movie, the resulting debacle is almost as entertaining as it is inept, with the added flaw that there's nothing particularly cool or outright funny about the film. Personally, it was a hoot watching these three stumble around this disaster of a cop thriller, but at the same time I was mighty depressed that there was no part of the movie I could get behind and declare ""now THAT'S what I came to see."" Don't bother getting this one unless your sole purpose is to subject yourself to cinematic weirdness.

The plot: a serial killer dubbed the Video Stalker (Robert Prentiss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alamo/dp/B0002DRDBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alamo</a>) kidnaps, tortures, and kills adulterous young women, compiling videos of their lives and death. The only thing standing in the way of his crime wave is the unlikely duo of trouble cops Dakota Smith (Williamson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Caesar/dp/B000053VB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Caesar</a>) and Kristin O'Connor (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Madam/dp/6305235155/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes, Madam!</a>), who will have to untangle a web of police corruption if they hope to succeed in their mission.

Personally, the best part of watching this film was counting all of the embarrassing technical and storytelling mishaps the movie subjects itself to. The entire production is veritable comedy of errors superficially disguised by decent cinematography. There really are too many stylistic bloopers to list in a review of this length, but some of the more obvious ones include... (1) the killer - whom we later find out has a criminal record - handles all of the material he leaves behind with his bare hands, but no one ever thinks to identify him by his fingerprints; (2) when chased by the killer's van, his first victim (Nina Richardson) is literally run down but even then refuses to scream for help, and subsequently sells a taser attack like a sleeping pill; (3) during an early motorcycle scene, Fred Williamson's double is obviously white; (4) when Smith investigates the aforementioned van, its door is being held open by a clearly visible arm not belonging to the killer, and (5) when Smith crashes his motorcycle in an explosive inferno and his body is nowhere to be found, the cops on the scene are quick to assume he went to the liquor store. All of these things happen within the film's first fifteen minutes and accurately herald the tone of things to come.

Despite technically being a thriller, ""Night Vision"" provides an okay offering of action, mainly in the form of a few shootouts and a car-motorcycle chase. Despite the presence of Cynthia Rothrock, there's only a bit of karate - mostly featuring her at the end, but Fred Williamson also has short brawl halfway through the flick wherein he throws some very sloppy kicks. The acting isn't as bad as much as the writing is, which more or less demands hammy deliveries from all of the performers with the exceptions of Robert Forster (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Brown/dp/B000068DBD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Brown</a>) as Smith's comrade and Robert Prentiss as the killer, who do respectively good and bad beyond their written roles. Truly, Robert Prentiss makes an awful antagonist: his character is certainly evil but his performance is so weak and weasely that his out-of-nowhere, police brutality-style death feels a lot more satisfying than it has any right to. Oh, and then there's dwarf rapper Bushwick Bill playing Smith's buddy and fellow Alcoholics Anonymous attendant: he's not a great actor and doesn't really contribute to the story, but the director apparently felt he was interesting enough to keep bringing him back for scenes throughout the movie. Alrighty.

As far as Cynthia Rothrock goes, this is definitely the strangest film she had done since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undefeatable/dp/B0024F08FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undefeatable</a>&nbsp;and the most all-around inept one since her fare with Leo Fong. I can't really speak for the careers of Fred Williamson or anybody else involved, but I think it's safe to say that they'd too appreciate us leaving this film mostly forgotten, and rightfully so. Only hardcore completionists and aficionados of nonsense need give this a look.",1317859200,2,4680,5.7979651162790695
1063332,2,6305745358,I purchased this for $2 at a local video store thinking it would be enjoyable on an ironic level. It's just a waste--though I'll give it two stars since Bushwick Bill of the Geto Boys is in it.,1202947200,,193,4.105263157894737
1063333,5,6305745358,"Oh my God this movie is so bad it's great. I never thought anyone could get so many bad cop cliches in one movie:

a) Two complete opposites get paired up together.

b) Willy Will Williamson gets shot and has to open his vest to show that he had a bulletproof vest.

c) Mr. Williamson has a drinking problem.

d) Fantastic Fred hates his chief.

I'd like to stop here, but the flaws in this movie are high-larious.

a) The WHOLE motorcycle scene. (It's quite obvious that those black things on the ground are exploding.

b) After Fred avoids the bombs, if you look in the background, there are no flames.

c) The song: ""Dakota Smith, you're 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 Steps away!""

d) After Dak shoots some dude IN THE HEAD Quick Draw-McGraw turns to him in amazement ""He's Dead!!!!"" Thanks toots.

e) Oh yeah her last name is not McGraw!

f) The disgustingly huge fat guys that hook up with the playboy bunnyesque chicks. Come on!

g) Newt (the midget.) His role is Oscar worthy.

h) The Video Stalker Barney the Dinosaur is more threatening

i) Video Stalkers death (sorry to ruin the end, but I think you'll see it coming.) His exact words ""I'm out of bullets (drops the gun)""

7893446,2,6305745358,"Oh man, where does one begin? First I would like to mention the totally annoying music, although most scenes have their own themes during the scenes they continuously repeat the same four bars of music. This movie was definitely made on the cheap, it is painfully obvious in the sets, I think they spent more money on the motel room scene than they did for the entire rest of the movie. And although I rented this to see Frau Rothrock in action, what I got was Fred Williamson in his underwear, yuck. Frau Rothrock has very few fight scenes and most of those are short. As far as the acting goes, Herr Williamson is obviously there just to collect a paycheck, Frau Rothrock seems to be making the best of a bad situation, the only one who is actually acting is Herr Forster. The dialog is horrible, even in the one scene that is played for laughs (I think), using innuendo and double entendres to imply fellatio. That was the high point of the movie. Oh, and let's not forget the terrible special effects, which were also poorly edited. Anyone who makes it through to the end of this movie deserves a prize.",1462838400,,1107,4.458128078817734
7893447,2,6305745358,"I recently decided I wanted to watch a bunch of Cynthia Rothrock (China O'Brien, Undefeatable) movies.  Well guess what?  That's surprisingly not easy to do.  As it turns out just about none of her movies are affordable on Amazon to buy except for her late 90s direct-to-video stuff and similarly her older stuff is nowhere to be found on Amazon Video or Netflix.

Now before we get started I'm sure you're asking yourself ""but is this a classy movie, like for a date night, right?""  You bet, bro!  We have ample nudity in just the first three minutes (quite a bit in the first 20 minutes and peppered throughout, in fact), we have the biggest female action star of the era (and she loves wearing tights to show off her karate-kickin' butt), and one of the biggest names in blaxploitation (Fred Williamson; From Dusk 'til Dawn).  So yeah, you bet it's classy!

Officer Dakota Smith (Fred Williamson) is an aging alcoholic recently demoted beat cop who has problems with authority and a tendency to draw his gun on fellow officers.  Kristin O'Connor (Rothrock) is a cute rookie (although she was about 40 when the movie was made) on probation with a tendency to kick sassy cops in the face.  It's as if they were meant to be partners.

They team up to stop a murderer in a black van from kidnapping and killing his young victims, and videotaping the whole thing to leave a calling card taunting the police.  As interesting as that already isn't, I was saddened to realize that this movie really stars Fred Williamson a lot more than it does Cynthia Rothrock.  We have the queen of martial arts and I only see her throw one kick in the first hour.  Whereas the aging Williamson has his laughable alley fight in which he strains to awkwardly kick so high I was almost certain he pulled a hamstring and tackles a guy into a pile of empty cardboard boxes.  By the way, has anyone actually ever seen a pile of empty cardboard boxes in an alley.  My guess is, if you have, they were only there because someone was about to shoot an 80s-90s action scene there.

But hey, there's some good to this flick.  For instance, it's scored like an action-themed porn movie (sometimes written and filmed like one, too) and it features a kooky dwarf.  Perhaps the only aspect of the movie that isn't awful is Robert Forster's (Olympus Has Fallen, Jackie Brown) performance and the awkward fat guy having naughty relations.  Speaking of which, there's an awful lot of nude naughtiness going on.  All told, we're looking at about ten boobs in this movie.  So, I have to wonder, what is Cynthia Rothrock even doing here?  She kicks one guyONE in the first hour!  This is like casting Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, The Expendables 2) and then not letting him break people.  I think the low point of the movie is when Rothrock uses about five different woodwind instrument playing innuendos for a man's penis.  Trombone, flute, sliding tromboneouch.  She must have needed the money.  But alas, it gets worse.  Towards the end of the movie she has a terrible fight scene (no doubt limited by the complete choreographical inability of the cast of bad guys), probably the worst of career.  It made my heart sink.

At this point you might be thinking ""hey, come on, it was the 90s--of course it sucks.""  Well, you hold your horses, Youngblood.  Jackie Brown, Con Air, Face/Off, Air Force One, Starship Troopers, The Edge, The Jackal, The Fifth Element, G. I. Jane, Tomorrow Never Dies and The Postman all came out the same year.  Wow.  Could you imagine being the person who picked Night Vision over any of these?  LOL.

Watch out for the 46 minute mark for some of the worst police work EVER.  Oof!  These two look like they had one completely unrehearsed, site-unseen take to get it right.  They look confused and they definitely don't know how to cover one another.  Later we see that no one on set knew what a gunfight should look like or how to handle a gun.

Probably influenced by Sliver (1993) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), our voyeuristic villain always seems to know exactly what our heroes are up to, going so far as to call them just to let them know that he knows where they are.  Our killer likes targeting promiscuous Catholic women who can't keep their clothes on.  Evidently the videos are then sold through ""crime syndicate porn channels.""  I guess we're supposed to believe that's a thing just because they said it.

I'm especially fond of the HUGE and luxurious apartment interiors we find within drab apartment complexes and how the little notes our criminal mastermind videographer leaves hint that this movie thinks it's playing off Seven (1995).  The film seemed to think it had a lot to say about alcoholism and adultery, but none of it was very convincing.  This was wholesale stupidity presented before us with a straight face.

The director (Gil Bettman) had really only ever done some TV work and a handful of unrecognizable movies.  He doesn't seem to have a clue how to direct an action movie, or a dramatic seen or anything.  And speaking of everything he did wrong, weren't there supposed to be martial arts in this?  He cast ""the queen of martial arts"" didn't give her anyone with fighting experience to face?  So she just hits people, and they just get hit and don't really do anything back.  Stupid.just stupid.

Watch this for a good laugh with a buzz but do not, I repeat DO NOT watch this expecting to see a Cynthia Rothrock martial arts movie. For of all the horrible things this movie is, ""that"" it is not.",1462579200,,5550,4.619631901840491

So my standards are low and I found a lot of humor in how bad the effects were, the clownish dialogue and general cheapness. But I am pretty sure I found the motel in Dento, TX were the Cadillac bed scene was shot and I plan to go there soon!

I have added a screen grab of the greatest blooper ever. At 12:30 into the movie, Dak stops a black van, as he walks up to the van, the two side door mysteriously swing open.
