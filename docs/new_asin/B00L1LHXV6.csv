6459681,2,B00L1LHXV6,"This was not a very well made movie, and trust me...I watch a lot of sci-fi/horror movies. Just wouldn't watch it again.",1417219200,,120,4.5

6459685,3,B00L1LHXV6,"Obviously a low budget film, however, they gave it a good go. Watch it for what it is and enjoy.  There's even a bit of a twist at the end.",1416441600,6,139,3.6333333333333333
6459686,3,B00L1LHXV6,It was okay. Good for a one time view with a few choice twists.,1415836800,3,63,3.5714285714285716
6459687,4,B00L1LHXV6,"A very worthy effort.  Although obviously done on a low-budget, this movie is strongest in the areas of story and performances.  Don't expect 50 million dollars worth of special F/X, expect a great script and strong performances... which is something that many 50 million dollar movies lack.

Give it a shot!",1413158400,,308,5.0

6459689,4,B00L1LHXV6,"A micro-budget film filled to the brim with beyond lousy special effects? Time for this bad movie junkie to give it a shot... *One movie later* And it's surprisingly not bad, once you get over the awful special effects and low production quality. (Which I seriously doubt most movie-viewers can handle. I suggest watching the trailer first before diving in.) Eternal Damn Nation is actually pretty fun to watch. You can tell the writer/director/producer triple threat who made this movie knew he has a tiny budget and milked it for all its worth, relishing in the horrible special effects. Tongue-in-cheek is the word I'm looking for here. A low budget, tongue-in-cheek horror film with a plot that plays itself seriously. It even has a couple of decent jump scares and provides a few laughs. I think this movie will surprise those intrepid viewers brave enough to sit through it with its sense of ""actually-not-that-badness."" Given a higher budget, I don't think this movie could have been any better, and I mean that in a good way. It strangely benefits from its low production values.",1420416000,,1087,4.913043478260869
6459690,1,B00L1LHXV6,"oh yeah, this one's a real class act........uh NOT!",1418256000,,51,4.777777777777778
6459691,3,B00L1LHXV6,"Ok, I'm surprised that this movie wasn't any worse than it was. Low budget, bad acting and laughable special effects. Oh, I forgot to mention terrible editing and sound. That being said, I can't say that I hated it or that I feel that I want the time I spent watching it back... of course I watched the movie for free.",1418169600,3,318,4.229508196721311
6459692,4,B00L1LHXV6,"It's a Good vs. Evil story and for a low-budget independent horror film, it's definitely worth a watch.",1418169600,2,103,4.777777777777778

6459696,3,B00L1LHXV6,"I think the acting was in dire need of improvement, but there is a surprise, and on a low budget, I guess the movie was tolerable. Lucifer is looking for human hosts to eventually occupy humanity and the world. But there are angels and one in particular explains things to a young woman. How it continues....well, it's up to you if you want to see this movie.",1417737600,4,359,4.373134328358209

8663095,2,B00L1LHXV6,"The story for ""Eternal Damn Nation"" is grandiose and over-thought but complete. It has the feel of some of the later ""Prophecy"" films but without the cast or budget. The vision and direction in ""Eternal Damn Nation"" is done well enough, just not to the level it needed to sell the story arc the writer was going for. The weak acting, poor timing between dialog & action, used for character development, created an awkwardness for me as a viewer. Everything came off a bit more like episodic melodrama with no real soul.

The special effects are basic low-grade CGI effects used mostly in vid games or television series so don't expect much when watching ""Eternal Damn Nation"". The film is a low budget film so I knew the effects were not going to be a big selling point, as most fans of indie cinema will also understand. I think with the weak, and stereotyped performances the CGI was becoming a bit more annoying to watch. ""Eternal Damn Nation"" is not a film that would watch again but the concept and vision is enough to make we look forward to the creative people behind this one's future projects.",1432080000,,1102,4.593908629441624

8663100,1,B00L1LHXV6,"This is beyond awful. The movie moves at a glacial pace, is trite and an utter waste of time. This movie is so bad, it wouldn't even qualify as fodder for Science Theater 3000!",1424908800,,176,4.205882352941177
8663101,2,B00L1LHXV6,"This show was made in both high definition and very lo def.  The lines were campy, cheesy and actually become the clich&eacute; of poorly made porn.  I suspect that this was an attempt by someone in the campy, cheesy porn industry to try to make a non-porn movie.  The movie was disjointed and done poorly until the ending, which was very poorly done.  It was such a train wreck that I could not stop watching.  The story line may have been an interesting one, but, the lines and acting fixed that.",1424476800,2,498,4.428571428571429
8663102,1,B00L1LHXV6,This was just really horrible.  I couldn't take it and I can generally sit through anything even if it is just for background noise.,1421193600,,132,4.5
8663103,4,B00L1LHXV6,"This film was great fun--exactly what low budget fright flicks could be seldom are. It has the requisite humor to pull off a title like Damn Nation. The acting with the exception of the male lead is quite good.  The hero/anti-hero may not be the best actor, but like Tony Curtis in one of his first parts, he fits in perfectly. For Curtis, it was a Viking film in which the star announces the sighting of the New World in an unshakable Bronx accent. The lead here also has a generic New Yawk accent that is truly cringe worthy when coupled with a sound that is reminiscent of a 13 year old on the verge of the change to manhood but now sounding rather like Donald Duck. Totally inspired and utterly natural. The female characters are without exception decent actresses who play their roles with campy flair.

The plot features a goofy apocalyptic angels and demons theme which the script writer seems to have researched through the works of Kim Harrison. Wonderfully weird. The script has some great intentional howlers, demonstrating a dark humor that too many low budget horror offerings seem to always miss. Check it out and enjoy.",1420934400,2,1134,4.665
8663104,2,B00L1LHXV6,"It's as entertaining - or not - as any other ""B"" rated demon flick. If you've seen one...",1420588800,,89,4.0
