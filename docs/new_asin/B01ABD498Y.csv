7597270,5,B01ABD498Y,"The stunningly successful team of Chinese actress Gong Li and director Zhang Yimou come together once again to produce another beautiful movie to add to their legacy.

Set against the Cultural Revolution and the years in the aftermath, Coming Home (based on the story by noted Chinese writer Geling Yan), focuses on a husband and wife who are separated when the husband Lu (a brilliant, understated performance by Chen Daoming) is sent away for ""re-education,"" leaving his wife Feng (the incomparable Gong Li) and young daughter Dan Dan behind. Ten years later, a brief encounter occurs and the repercussions from that meeting form the basis for the rest of this emotionally engaging and heartbreaking character study.

Superficially, Coming Home is a heart-rending love story. Underneath, it speaks to the tragedies that linger long after the political landscape has shifted. It amazes me that Yimou is able to produce these movies in todays China, despite the governmental oversight of all art (the film won the Golden Lotus for best movie in 2014). While not an in-your-face indictment of the policies that underlie the plot, it does force the viewer to consider the long-term effects of Maos years in power. Regardless, Coming Home is a gorgeously filmed, emotionally draining, and thought-provoking powerhouse of a film.

The Blu-ray disc offers a commentary from the director as well as a Q & A with him from the Toronto Film Festival.",1459296000,15,1441,5.0974576271186445

This certainly isn't a face-paced film.  But, as they say, slow waters run deep.  It was only during the final scene that I realized the depths this film is working in.  I feel so privileged to have seen this movie.",1457740800,10,451,4.068181818181818
7597273,4,B01ABD498Y,"I found the amnesia to be an unnecessary and jarring twist initially, but I eventually was won over by the performance by the three leads. Cultural Revolution and its impacts on the family all by themselves would have been profound enough. Telling the story plainly would have been more powerful. Qiu Ju was one of such stories (although set in a different era) by Gong Li and Zhang Yimou.

This of course is the shortcoming of the book which the movie is adapted from.",1457481600,,469,4.583333333333333
7597274,4,B01ABD498Y,"""Coming Home"" (2014 release from China; 110 min.) brings the story of Lu, a ""rightist bastard"" during the Cultural Revolution. As the movie opens, we see a woman (Feng) and her daughter (Dandan) being called into the Propaganda Office of the girl's school, where they learn that Lu (the husband and father, respectively) has escaped from labor camp, and that they are not to see him. Feng and Lu nevertheless decide to meet up at the train station, where Lu gets captured again. We are then told ""Three years later, the Cultural Revolution ends"", and Lu arrives back home. Much to his shock, Feng does not recognize him. What caused Feng's amnesia? Will she ultimately recognize him? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Zhang Yimou (best known here for ""House of the Flying Daggers""), Here he tackles a potentially sensitive topic in China, namely the horrible Cultural Revolution. But don't think that this is a political movie. Instead, it is a love story that happens to be set during and after the Cultural Revolution. Feng is played by the leading Chinese actress Gong Li (think of her as the Meryl Streep of China), and plays the role with restraint and visible hurt. Special mention also for the beautiful Zhang Huiwen in the role of Dandan (check out the ballet performances!). Last but not least, I couldn't help but notice that the piano you hear in the orchestral score is played by none other than Lang Lang. Bottom line: ""Coming Home"" is a slow-moving (in the best possible way) movie that examines the long shadows of the Cultural Revolution through the eyes of one particular couple.

The movie showed up out of the blue last October (yes, 18 months after its original release) at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Better late than never I suppose. The weekday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly. A shame. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare, you may want to give this a try. ""Coming Home"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1453680000,21,2184,4.744736842105263

This movie is all about subtlety - little said but so much in facial expressions.  I've now watched several movies with Gong Li and the director and being an English-only speaker I think enhances my attention to the detail this pair brings to the screen.  Yes i read the English subtitles but I could almost watch the movie without them. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

8746948,4,B01ABD498Y,"""Coming Home"" is a fantastic drama. It is an extremely emotional movie about a family that is torn apart by external political forces, internal betrayal, and psychological illness.

The movie opens as the father escapes from a labor camp during the Cultural Revolution, an upending and tumultuous ten-year period in China. His wife and daughter get word that he has escaped and anticipate his arrival. However, the daughter is caught up in the Cultural Revolution's political tumult, causing her father to never reconnect with her mother, his wife. If there is a more tense and dramatic opening in all of cinema, I have yet to see it. When the Cultural Revolution ends, the father returns home. Unfortunately, his wife has developed a heartbreaking form of amnesia in which she cannot recognize her husband, although she believes he will be coming home shortly. Her husbands unconditional love keeps him with her, trying throughout the movie to help her realize who he is.

The acting is brilliant and the setting is wonderful. Most of the movie takes place in the alley where the family lives and a train station, where the father's arrival is expected. The movie is tight with many tension-filled moments where the actors let their expressions speak for them, rather than their voices.

The DVD included a dubbed versions in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, as well as English, Spanish, Portuguese and French subtitles, but no descriptive English subtitles.",1505260800,,1460,5.100418410041841
8746949,5,B01ABD498Y,"Absorbing drama that will capture you due its relentless tension. A devastating emotional blast will generate a terrible familiar disgrace.
