8739003,2,B00B7AE7XI,"This is one of my favorite dramas so I was so excited when I found it on here that I was willing to buy it even though it didn't have English subtitles. But I was so sad when I went to play the second disc (which has one of my favorite episodes on it) and it only played about 1/4 of episode 4 (the first episode on the disc) and freezes up. I tried to clean it, did not work. I tried to skip a head, would not do it. I tried to skip the episode altogether, and none of the other episodes would even attempt to play. Disc 1 and Disc 3 played just fine, and I have not tried disc 4 yet. I'm just really sad that I'm missing out on my favorite episode.",1490054400,,650,3.786764705882353
