2175262,5,B000688KZS,"There's some confusion here that needs clearing up.  Whoever that was who said there weren't music videos on this DVD, just a lot of talking about ""how we did it"" is confusing this DVD with The Making of Pump, I think.  Or maybe Amazon stuck the review on the wrong DVD.  I've seen them do that before.  This video is filled with Aerosmith's MTV videos.  There's a table of contents in another review below this one.",1155081600,5,416,4.421052631578948

I Hope more will be available To Buy soon. 10 Stars For This DVD""",1149984000,4,333,3.911764705882353
2175264,1,B000688KZS,"I thought it would be cool music videos but no it's just ""How we Wrote This, How we wrote that, bla bla bla bla bla!""",1149984000,3,117,3.72
2175265,5,B000688KZS,"I've heard some people dismiss music video collections by saying, ""I can just turn on MTV and watch them anytime I want"".  This is completely untrue.  Your yen for Aerosmith is always going to be subject to the capriciousness of the programming Gods, who are invariably biased in favor of brand spanking new material.  So, if you get a sudden itch to see Steven get nasty with the stage in Love In An Elevator, your chances are about one in a thousand of seeing it if you turn on MTV and watch for a few hours.  But if you have this DVD, you can watch it anytime you want.  You can even rewind and see him do it twice.  Heck, you can take a video cap of it and use it as wallpaper if the fancy takes you.  In addition to the videos, you get a lot of behind the scenes footage.

8040191,5,B000688KZS,"I have always been a big fan of Aerosmith. I actually had this product in VHS format but wanted a DVD copy of it. I continue to enjoy the tracks on this DVD as much as I enjoy the new tracks on their new album Music from Another Dimension. It truly is a testament to the musicianship of Aerosmith that they have been around for several decades and still going strong. For people like me that enjoy getting on a trainer to ride inside when it is too cold to be outside, or even when I am doing a 10K on the trail in preparation for a race, this music has and can send me into a joyous trance that I can sync to how my body is responding to the exercise routine I am doing. Even without using their music to exercise, I find myself listening to them while reading, dictating or cooking. Aerosmith has kept me company, happy company for many years.",1352419200,,845,4.158536585365853

8040194,5,B000688KZS,"There are some bands whose video projects are as exciting as their recorded works, and Aerosmith is one of them.  Just like putting on your favorite CD and skipping to your favorite tracks, this DVD allows you to do the same with your favorite videos, and the theatrical punch of Steven Tyler makes these videos so much more fun than the average band out there.  These stand the test of time, and are as enjoyable today as they were 20 years ago.",1278547200,,446,4.426829268292683
