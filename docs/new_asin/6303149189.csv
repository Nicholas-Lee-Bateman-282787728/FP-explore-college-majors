572407,2,6303149189,"This movie had some pros, but a lot of cons. One of the things I've heard about this movie from fans was how scary it is. I love a good scare. That's why I liked ""Dracula: Prince of Darkness"" so much. It was scary. And this movie is scarier according to fans. So I had to check it out. Although, it did have one or two scary parts in it, I found that this film was seriously lacking in horror. I personally feel that the previous Dracula films in the Hammer series were scarier than this. I also found this film to be kind of camp. The first in the Hammer Dracula series that I found campy. I also found the film to be kind of boring, and apart from Dracula's servant Klove (played by the great Patrick Troughton), I found the characters uninteresting. I honestly can't believe how popular this one is. But it isn't all bad. Like I said there is one or two scary parts in it, just not very many. There are some great actors in it, with my favorite being Patrick Troughton who is most famous for being the 2nd Doctor in Doctor Who, and his character of Klove was a very interesting character, and even though I found the movie to be boring, it did have an original story in it, making a change from the last two Dracula entries which follow the same basic plot has the other ones. It's worth checking out, but not worth buying in my opinion.",1458259200,,1340,4.217898832684825

572491,4,6303149189,"In my opinion this is a much better film than Taste the Blood of Dracula. But my main point here is that this is the DVD you should but instead of paying collectors prices. It says region 4, but it's actually NTSC region free, and it has the commentary from the anchor bay DVD. The anchor bay DVD has been out of print for years.",1452038400,2,329,4.076923076923077
572492,4,6303149189,"Interesting 'claustrophobic', atmospheric entry in the Hammer series, though with a definite 'cheaper look' about it.  It has been said that as much money as the other entries in the series went into it, so the 'cheapness' in actuality may be unfounded.  My feeling is the decision of the producer to do the casting herself, instead of using the Hammer casting man Jimmy Liggat in order to save $$ didn't help matters, as some poor casting is apparent.  I am hoping the Blu ray will find the notorious Dracula 'Blood Lapping' scene after the murder of Tania restored, having been cut by the BBFC before release, but having managed to make it to some of the promotional material.  This should help round out the intentions of the script and complete the intended 'sadistic' element that was censored.  A 'Nightmare' atmosphere and all it's trimmings should be left as it was originally intended!",1446940800,,894,4.855263157894737

looking for the young mans brother who has made a early exit in the film but also  where Dracula sinks his teeth into five victims and tortures a servant (who in some ways looks like robert de niro  a little ) in in a graphically violent scene. A priest is attacked by a bat and meets his maker much earlier than anticipated. Naturally, the girl is soon  coveted by Dracula, and the heroic young man must come to her rescue. There are typical scenes of religious defilement, arson, and the requisite wooden cross that wards off the evil bloodsucker. Dracula meets his fiery demise (yeah, right) when the foreboding castle is torched again . No matter how he meets his end, rest assured Dracula will rise once again from any grave he finds himself in at the end of every film and lee is great at this part",1430265600,5,1048,4.534391534391534

572553,5,6303149189,"I've been revisiting these Dracula vampire films in reverse order of release recently . A while back I streamed The Satanic Rites Of Dracula over at Warner Archive Instant . That was like my third viewing of that picture and prompted my reverse viewing notion . Having delighted in the many charms of my second viewing of Dracula A.D. 1972 on physical media , I arrived here eager and excited . I have the great good fortune to own the Anchor Bay double disc version of Scars Of Dracula and upon this eve's second viewing am thrilled to report that the film and print are grand indeed .
One of the things i really enjoy about Scars , similar to 1966's The Deadly Bees , is studying all the murals , matte paintings , animation and so on that stand in for authentic locations , backdrops , etc . Equally fun for me are the practical physical effects such as an actual torched person with protective gloves , facial mask replica , burn cape , etc . The giant bats (including one that regurgitates blood) are fun , funny and thrilling all at once . There's a pecking order(s)  to these huge devil bats that's wicked and wild . Klove is another great Hammer creation and Lee himself gets more screen time and certainly more dialog than any other Dracula picture in the series . Great stuff . I love Roy Ward Baker and his films . This furthers his triumphs in my book .",1427500800,2,1365,4.352941176470588

572651,2,6303149189,"Christopher Lee is the classic Dracula and I love the Hammer films but this one wears especially thin when seen in the context of the series.  Dracula's return is even more goofy than in previous films, two of which he's been utterly destroyed.  Prince of Darkness showed a somewhat clever resurrection but the rest are frankly pretty lame.  That's easy to overlook given that in exchange for not rolling your eyes, you get to watch Lee play out his most famous role yet again.

Except with Scars, it seems to be one time too many.  The previous films all offered you something new, not in the development of the undead master of darkness but in the people that he threatened.  All were interesting characters in their own right.  You were drawn into their story, even when they weren't the most upstanding of citizens.  Hammer did a fantastic job making diverse characters that drew you into the action.

Except that Scars gives you cardboard cutouts with virtually no charisma to them.  The acting is fine but there isn't much for the actors to work with.  The story is a direct replay of previous films without any attempt to do anything different.  Even Lee seems tired of the role by this point.  In all, it seems as if they went back to the well one time too many.  It just doesn't work.

PROS:

Some really nice matte painting effects
Dracula's new system of protection is pretty clever
It has Christopher Lee

CONS:

Creativity of previous films is missing
Cookie-cutter storyline
A bit on the boring side
Lacks in atmosphere",1412467200,,1533,4.677902621722846

What surprised me was the malevolence that this Dracula brought to the screen. This I believe was the first Hammer Studio's Dracula that was rated :R by the MPAA. There was lots of blood and a little nudity. Dracula was purely evil in this story and that made for a great villain. The body count was higher than the previous Hammer Dracula movies. I believe that's why I enjoyed it, because Dracula's character was  ramped up few decibels. Forget the criticism of him using a knife to stab one of his vampire girls, the killer bat and etc. I actually felt that this Dracula was a formidable foe. Those eyes of his flashing thru his eyelids while asleep to repel a would be assassin. Dracula scaling the outer castle wall to enter the window of the door less stair less room.

This is also the movie with a brief glimpse of a typical Hammer British beauty running away from the camera sans clothing from the rear. So maybe it's not the ideal choice for sharing with smaller children. But it is GREAT fun. Cheap special effects, a truly demented Ygor (his relationship with the Count is the most disturbing part of the picture), stirring music, clueless heroes... this is one of my favorite Hammer vampire movies.

My sister joked about one of Lee's Dracula movies while watching it saying when she watches a Dracula movie she expects to see him. That is not a problem here as Lee has a lot more screen time. I thought this movie had a great supporting cast. I thought Christopher Matthews did a good job along with Wendy Hamilton in their supporting roles. Jenny Hanley was great as the female lead. This is a very violent Dracula film and there were parts that surprised me. I thought the first act of the movie was very good and that was important. There was good character development. These are characters were care about. Matthews is a character who is not as likable being a thief and womanizer on the surface but there is depth to his character. He is a good brother. I liked Hamilton's character and wish they gave her a bigger part because she is one of the most likable characters certainly the most caring and genuine people in the village. The servant Klove to Dracula is a great addition to the storyline and movie. Patrick Troughton was also a good support and very scary. He is used right.  Dracula is more scarier than ever. There is great suspense in the film. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It had a great ending. The ending was very exciting. I found this to be a sleeper hit I didn't expect it to be as good as Horror of Dracula but it's still a great Dracula movie. It's one of my favorite Dracula movies starring Christopher Lee.

572820,4,6303149189,"For a film made in 1970, I have to say, I actually really enjoyed watching it! I especially liked Christopher Lee as the evil Count Dracula and Patrick Troughton as his abused yet loyal love-smitten servant, Klove. Jenny Hanley did an admirable job as the beautiful Sarah and the two brothers were decent if not a little two dimensional and boring at times.

I was most impressed with Pat Troughton's performance in particular! He did a fantastic job portraying a man who falls hopelessly in love with the girl intended to be his master's next meal. He's a conflicted character who keeps the audience guessing whose side he's really on until the very end! (I was more interested in his story than the main plot to be honest!) And the part when Dracula punishes Klove for allowing the two young lovers to escape is one of the most memorable scenes in the entire film!

The special effects are dated now (I laugh every time that silly bat is onscreen!) but the film has a certain charm that can only be appreciated by fans of the old classic Hammer horror films. Despite it's small budget and limited special effects, the story is solid and never drags. The action is good and there are one or two scenes that leave quite an impression on the audience since this film is credited as being the ""goriest"" and ""bloodiest"" out of all the Dracula films. (The grim fate of Simon's playboy brother is not for the fainted-hearted and actually surprised me!)

Overall, this film was a pleasure to watch! Don't let the fact that it was made back in the 70's keep you from checking out this classic horror flick!",1353110400,,1599,4.583916083916084
572821,4,6303149189,"This review is for the Lionsgate DVD-R version of the movie. I figure that you're either already familiar with the move it self or you can figure out if you'll like the movie from other reviews.

Essentially what you need to know about the Lionsgate DVD-R is that it is an exact duplicate of the Anchor Bay version that was part of their Hammer Collection. A lot of movie collectors avoid DVD-Rs. There are two reasons for this. The first is that there has been speculation that DVD-Rs don't last as long as regular DVDs. My boss is a rabid movie collector and we've done a lot of research on this and what we have discovered is that the research seems to suggest that this isn't true. What is true is that DVD-Rs are more vulnerable to scratches if you don't store them properly. The other reason a lot of collectors avoid DVD-Rs is because they are print-on-demand they are not considered as collectible. In this case Hammer Collectors seek out the Anchor Bay Hammer films as a collection. Some aren't as particular which version they prefer but they want a real DVD. Many eventually purchase region free players so they can purchase superior or cheaper (or both) UK versions of the movies that are either too expensive on the collector's market, or inferior in the US format.

But essentially, if viewing is what matters to you, and you're looking for a good version of the film, this is the Anchor Bay version which is solid and respected. In my opinion they're charging about twice what a burn should go for, and I highly doubt these will ever rise in value as collectibles (particularly after they're all eventually released on Blu-Ray, everything is disposable in the end, my friend. And the disk label is about as generic looking as something you'd find in your office. But the content on the disk is solid.",1351036800,9,1815,4.61609907120743
572822,4,6303149189,"I have always loved the Gothic horror tale - from Bela Lugosi's Dracula and the rest of the Universal Horror family through the Hammer years and their various monster mashes. If you love period pieces and the old monster classic - you'll love this one. The Hammer films are much more edgy - pushing the envelop with regard to how they handle sex and nudity - but by today's standards they are pretty tame. The only Hammer Film I would say to avoid is the Circus of Vampires - very bad! I collect classic horror films and have all of the Universal films and most of the Hammer films - but the Circus is one I will not buy - for any price.

If you like Christopher Lee/Bela Lugosi films - you'll love this one.

This has a single disc and the featured film only, and the other with 2 amazing music videos and the ""Faces Of Christopher Lee"" documentary that made this an attractive collectible has been removed, in spite of what the packaging still claims. The lobby card art is also missing inside, so buyer, beware. ""Scars Of Dracula"" isn't bad as a latter entry in the Lee Dracula canon. It's spoiled slightly, though, by jarringly fake and excessive gore, with regrettably gratuitous sadism. Christopher Lee felt similarly, as optional on-screen commentary attests.

572901,4,6303149189,"The fans and critics are correct, ""Scars of Dracula"" is a departure from Hammer Production's Dracula series.  It is definitely gorier and more violent than the others as though targeted for younger audiences who were craving more gore and violence in the early seventies.  In ""Scars of Dracula,"" Dracula appears more evil and diabolical.  His violent outbursts are quite shocking.  Perhaps he hasn't been getting enough sleep.  That would explain the bloodshot eyes.  Furthermore, Dracula always had a sense of class and breeding; in this film, he's a veritable brute.

  I enjoyed ""Scars of Dracula.""  Though I don't consider myself a gore hound, I do love a high body count.  This movie promised an extremely high one but I was disappointed.  It begins with a bang:  The mass spilling of innocent blood inside a church (quite blasphemous and daring for 1970).  However, the pace slows down and never quite picks up.  The ending itself wasn't anything spectacular or memorable.  However, I'll never forget when Dracula loses his temper and repeatedly stabs his vampire girlfriend with a knife.

  As always, horror legend Christopher Lee has great stage presence.  His performance as Dracula is still superb despite character alterations.  Unlike, ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness,"" he actually speaks instead of only appearing sinister.  I was thankful for this.  I am very fond of Lee's deep, manly voice.  It sounds both charming and villainous at the same time.  You must add ""Scars of Dracula"" to your Christopher Lee Dracula series from Hammer Production.  In fact, it is highly recommended for all fans of Lee.

Note of Interest:  I ordered ""Scars of Dracula"" new from Amazon.com.  The jewel case did not have the bonus DVD as advertised on the cover.  Nor did it have the customary movie poster.  I was very disappointed that Anchor Bay failed to include these items in my purchase.",1220572800,3,1888,5.029220779220779

So what if it had flaws, Hammer films were made on tight budgets and were all made in lightning speeds, so they didn't have time to fix everything. Anyway, I like this movie for five reasons.

1. The widescreen print is beautiful

2. Very good acting, yet Dracula talked a bit much

3. The actresses are pretty hot.

4. Cheap, but decent sets

5. Funny, Memorable Charachters.

Really, I don't know about you people that said it's a bad movie; if you don't like it, then don't go around commenting negative things about it so the people that actually want to buy this flick won't chnage their minds.",1215648000,,760,4.3546099290780145
572903,2,6303149189,"The budgets were hitting rock bottom and the formula getting tired by the time Hammer persuaded Christopher Lee to don the cape yet again for 1970's Scars of Dracula their second Dracula outing of the year after the superior Taste the Blood of Dracula. Not particularly bad though awfully overfamiliar, this has the feel of everyone clocking on to work at a treadmill as yet another unwary (and in this case accidental) traveller finds himself shunned by tight-lipped superstitious locals (well, Michael Ripper and a couple of extras) and soon regretting taking advantage of the Count's hospitality in the first half while in the second half his brother (a young and miscast Dennis Waterman) and romantic interest Jenny Hanley go through much of the same routine in the second as they go in search of him. There's an effectively nasty surprise waiting for the villagers in the church after their early attempt to burn the Count out of house and home and there's an engagingly matter of fact just-another-day-at-work sequence where Patrick Troughton's servant discards the remnants of one of his master's unwanted brides with a hacksaw and an acid bath but this is more notable for upping the violence than improving the quality.

Anchor Bay's Region 1 DVD offers an interesting package of extras - audio commentary by Christopher Lee, Roy Ward Baker and Marcus Hearn, stills and poster gallery, double-bill trailer for Scars of Dracula + The Horror of Frankenstein, and the UK theatrical trailer. Most copies also contain a second disc with a 50-minute documentary The Many Faces of Christopher Lee, produced for UK video in the early 90s, which has the star running through his favorite anecdotes. Be warned that this second disc also includes two very odd middle-of-the-road music videos...",1204675200,,1792,5.074576271186441
572904,3,6303149189,"After reading the other reviews, I really expected a really awful film, so I was pleasantly surprised that the film was not as bad as I expected.  Several reviewers said that something was missing but couldn't say what.  I can tell you.  Peter Cushing. Or some other actor of the same ability. Let's face it. Even in a part that he did not really want to play, Christopher Lee is a giant talent.  He towers over the rest of the cast and it is just not believable that this crew of very nice but remarkably ordinary people could bring down such a terrible monster. In fact, in the end they don't. The writers had to bring out a ""deux ex machina"" and Dracula is struck down by a bolt of lightening out of the heavens.
Actually, I bought this disc for the special features. These turned out, by themselves, to be worth the purchase price. There are two parts worth mentioning. First is the commentary by Christopher Lee and the director.  this gives us several things  one is a chance to listen to Christopher as himself. He comes across as a working actor who thoroughly enjoyed his work and had a considerable respect for the other actors. I don't know how many times he repeats about another actor, ""He is a lovely man."" To people not familiar with the reserve typical of the English of his generation, this may  seem faint praise, but translated into American Idiom, it means ""He was a joy to work with, and I loved every minute I spent with him.""  But even more than the glimpse of the actor, was the insight it gave into the workings of the Hammer Film Corporation and the way they made movies. To me, who had watched so many Hammer Films, but had no knowledge of the organization behind them, except that they were filmed in England, this is very interesting. One of the great joys of DVD viewing is the look we get into the nuts and bolts of movie making through the special features tracks.
In addition to the commentary, this set includes a separate disc where Mr. Lee gives a overview of his career. This is fascinating in that I had never realized that he has played in so many  different kinds of parts.  I am sorry though, that this was taped before his masterful performance as Saruman in Lord Of The Rings. I would have loved to hear his comments on that part.
On the whole, the disc is just what the makers of the movie intended- a simple, low budget, mildly entertaining, typical horror movie. They weren't aiming for a classic and they didn't get one.  But I'd like to comment that given the choice of watching any of the Halloween sequels, any of the Friday the  Thirteenth sequels, or any of the Lee as Dracula sequels, Dracula wins with me hands down.",1196121600,3,2670,4.437627811860941
572905,3,6303149189,"I'm giving a thumbs up to Scars of Dracula, a vampire bloodbath which many feel is one of the lesser Hammer films.  The movie has its problems; the bat special effects are sad, and some scenes (like Paul in bed with the burgermeister's daughter, and Dracula's death scene) should have been edited down a bit.  But the film succeeds in portraying what (I think) a vampire should be: a malevolent, sadistic beast, a demon from the Pit that mere humans, including Christians, are hard-pressed to deal with.

Christopher Lee puts on a superior performance as a vampire that is not sophisticated, not sympathetic, but an evil monster, and he has more screen time and dialogue in this film than in most Hammer Dracula films; he isn't just a sinister force in the background, we actually see Dracula doing the things you expect Dracula to do, like murdering and torturing people, climbing walls like a spider, and overpowering or outwitting the Christians who try to destroy him.

Patrick Troughton also gives a good performance as Dracula's servant.  The protagonists aren't as interesting or as well acted as the villains, but they aren't distractingly bad, and the girls are pretty.

Definitely worth a look for horror fans.",1194480000,,1220,4.926829268292683
572906,2,6303149189,"If I could have given 2.5 stars it would have got an extra 1/2 of a star. I am a lover of Hammer horror films, but having seen this recently it really is rather poor.

Dennis Waterman is hopelessly miscast in a sort of romantic upper class leading role. He is one of two brothers who are pitted against the Count. There are two main problems with this film. Firstly it was made in 1970 and it has an early 70's feel to it, which isn't a good thing. Secondly there was no Peter Cushing or even somebodyelse to replace the Van Helsing character. Consequently the Counts opponents appear weak and a lot of believability (if you can such a thing in a Hammer film!) is lost. Christopher Lee himself was quoted as saying this was one of the weaker films of the series.

None of Hammers films had huge budgets, but because of this films other failings, you tend to notice the poor special effects. By comparison to the other films in the series this is certainly one of the weakest. If you want to buy the Christopher Lee Dracula films the first is by far and away the best, and one of the best Hammer films ever made. The 2nd film Dracula Prince Of Darkness is pretty good. I haven't seen any of the others recently.

There isn't much on the plus side for this film, but James Bernards score, as always, is very good. If you really do want want this film you would be better buying the 5 film Hammer boxed set it appears in, where at least you get The Devil Rides out as well, which IS a classic Hammer film.",1190937600,2,1502,4.244755244755245
572907,4,6303149189,"I just recently obtained the Scars of Dracula dvd after having the vhs version for over 10 years. There is a difference in screen formats which made me think ""Why don't they just release the dvd in full screen?"" I compared the picture of the dvd to the vhs because I noticed something missing. 1:85 matted formats cut out the top and bottom of the picture to make it ""resemble"" widescreen. Sure enough, black bars at the top and bottom replaced the full vhs picture on the dvd. I recently read an article that stated 1:85 matted is what the director originally wanted. In 2 different movies a boom mike was shown at the top of the Princess Bride scene while shorts were shown on a character in A Fish Called Wanda who was supposed to be naked. These examples explained to me some films are matted in this fashion.

The Scars of Dracula dvd's color and clarity were far superior to that of the vhs. The bright reds were a sight to behold, and I found that the night scenes, which were too dark in the vhs version, to be clear and crisp in the dvd. Dracula's resurrection in the castle where he walks to the window was mottled and dark on my original vhs tape. The dvd also wins with the extra features and commentary by Lee. I would have rated this as 5 stars if I knew more about the matted format, which I deducted a star from.",1186617600,,1328,4.290836653386454
573016,4,6303149189,"If you like the Chris Lee Dracula films as much as I do, I would recommend getting this one along with Horror of Dracula, Dracula-Prince of Darkness, and Dracula has Risen from the Grave. This one follows the same style setting---England in the 1800's. This particular film has a good bit of supense, and Lee is really evil in this one. Much better than Taste the Blood and AD 1972, this movie follows a formula that really works best for Lee's portrayal of this character---it was a return to form with Lee playing the darker,deadlier Dracula that he was in the first 3 films. The storyline is similiar, of course, with Dracula wreaking havoc on a local community who cower at the mention of his name until a young hero arrives to save the day. The ending is typical, but there is a twist. I won't give it away totally, but the hero thinks he has Dracula when he spears him with a long metal spike only to see Dracula smile and pull the spike out without leaving a mark or any drop of blood.",1174003200,2,992,4.367567567567567

It is, however, the most risqu, surprisingly so. In addition, this Anchor Bay release of the film has a bonus second feature entitled; The Many Faces of Christopher Lee, which is a lot of fun for fans of the legendary actor, especially the ludicrous music videos included, which are absolutely hilarious.  Really, Hammer never made a bad Dracula or Frankenstein film, and it's a shame that most modern horror enthusiasts lack an appreciation for these old gems, because they're really missing out. This one is especially worth picking up, because of the second feature, and perhaps might be a good entry level film for modern film goers, since there is a bit more blood and skin in this one.

Also, in response to an earlier reviewer's statements, Bela Lugosi only played Dracula twice on film, once in Dracula, and once in Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Christopher Lee, however, played him ten times, and for my money, is the superior count.",1170201600,,1094,4.940217391304348
573018,4,6303149189,"Yes, the Hammer Dracula series continues, and this would be the last of the gothic era films.  Roy Ward Baker has inherited the franchise and he does a rather good directing job considering the material isn't too original this time around.  In the previous film, they tried to up the ante a bit by slapping an R rating on the series.  It didn't really seem to achieve one, but Scars does.  One scene has Dracula violently stabbing a woman to death.  This may not be too shocking by today's standards, but it probably shocked at the time.  It still is kinda brutal though.  Plus we have a church full of bloody corpses from a rubber vampire bat attack.  Scars also seems to be a sequel to Taste, though there are some major continuity errors between the two.  This film has my vote for the most laughable ""birth""(especially the birth!) and ""death"" of Dracula.  Plotwise, it's rather simple.  A couple of unsuspecting Britishfolk stumble onto Dracula's castle and must escape and destroy the evil.  That's really about it.  Dracula's a little more talkative this time around.  Though Lee supposedly was sick of the role by this time, he can still do it like no one can.  Even a tired performance by Lee is a good one!  Of course we get the great gothic atmosphere, a sinister castle, sexy women and Michael Ripper!  What more do you need?  Plus it comes with a great Christopher Lee documentary/interview disc that runs about an hour.  Man, he really seems like a cool guy.  Well worth it.",1153353600,2,1487,4.603053435114504

Perhaps it's the fact that the story seems to fit nowhere into the previously established timeline, or is it the bizarre idea that the villagers think they can burn Dracula to death, or is it ex-Dr. Who's Patrick Troughton incredible performnace as Dracula's once-previously killed manservant Klove?

The movie starts off in Dracula's Castle (Different looking than the castle in the other films, but very cool!) from there we see the remains of Dracula wich is nothing but his cape and red powder (His blood) a fake but neat looking bat enters and drips it's blood over the remains of Dracula. After that Dracula rises from the grave (Again!. The towns people of Carlsbad soon find out that Dracula has risen again!

Simon, Sarah's bow discovers that his brother Paul is missing, he and Sarah leave town in searech for Paul and end up at Dracula's castle. While in Dracula's castle Klove, Dracula's servant, falls for Sarah and does not want Dracula to destroy her. Of course this leads to Dracula to punish Klove.

Fortunatly Simon was able to track down Dracula, and soon after Dracula went up in flames.

The movie does have it's weak parts and questions. Such as...

1) Why did Dracula stab his vampire bride to death with a knife?

2) Why where bats only introduced in this sequel and never appeared again?

3) Is the Klove in this sequel suppost to be the same Klove in Dracula Prince Of Darkness?

573094,5,6303149189,This is considered the worst Lee Dracula film. I disagree. I think it's one of the best. For one thing it is easily the goriest Hammer Dracula film (it was the first one to get an R rating in the US) with some mild nudity thrown in. The violence is strong and savage and played to the hilt by Lee. Also there are two sequences that come directly from Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel--Dracula sleeping in a room with no way in or out--except a window; and when Dracula climbs UP the castle wall from window to window. It was great seeing Hammer at least (for once) TRYING to get some of Stoker's creation on screen. Also Patrick Troughton is very good as Dracula's servant Klove and even Christopher Matthews has a few moments as the doomed Paul. But Lee's acting is the main reason to see this. He has more screen time and dialogue in this than any of the other Draculas and he just gives out an incredible performance. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen.,1118966400,2,978,4.3791208791208796

Color me there...and even though the film is ultimately flawed, I still had a really good time overall given this was the last time Lee would play Dracula in a Hammer film set within the period of prior films (the following incarnation would be titled `Dracula A.D. 1972', featuring a more contemporary setting).  Directed by the renowned Roy Ward Baker (Quatermass and the Pit, The Vampire Lovers, The Monster Club), the film stars, as I mentioned, Christopher Lee (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers), along with Dennis Waterman (School for Unclaimed Girls), and Jenny Hanley (The Flesh and Blood Show).  Also appearing is Patrick Troughton (The Gorgon, The Viking Queen), Michael Gwynn (Jason and the Argonauts), Christopher Matthews (Scream and Scream Again), and perennial English character actor Michael Ripper (X the Unknown, The Plague of the Zombies, The Reptile).

The film opens on an ominous miniature...er, I mean an ominous castle, and we see a cape covered with red dust (the immortal remains of Dracula).  With a little help from a winged friend, we witness a bit of the old reconstitution, proving once again you can't keep an evil bloodsucker down.  The residents of a nearby village soon learn their nightmare begins anew, decide to take matters in their own hands by torching the castle (I wouldn't have thought stone could burn, but hey, what do I know?), despite warnings from the priest who fears that what goes around comes around...and perhaps they should have listened to him as when they return to the village, well, it's not a pretty sight.  It's at this point we meet three young people, two brothers in Paul (Matthews), the philanderer type, and Simon (Waterman), the goodie-two shoes type, along with the comely Sara (Hanley), the object of Simon's desires, whereas Paul, well, his desires tend to vary, not being restricted by that whole `monogamy' nonsense.  After a series of events (or as I like to call them `the dalliances of Paul'), Paul ends up at the partially charred castle (the renovation seems to be going well), not realizing the nature of the danger he's in until it's too late.  Soon afterwards, both Simon and Sara come looking, and their search also leads them to the castle, to which they meet Dracula (Lee) and his less than savory, heavily eye browed (he's got the Abe Vigoda eyebrows) manservant Klove (I actually didn't learn his name until the end, and thus referred to him throughout as Uni-brow, due to the fact his two eyebrows had since merged into one, gigantic hairy entity on his forehead).  The Count's hospitality soon turns to bloodthirsty lust, which leads to a climatic, almost biblical ending...

As I mentioned, while I did enjoy this film, the overall sense was that it was somewhat lacking and unfocused.  The story starts off really strong, but then drops off for about the next 45 minutes or so...but that didn't really bother me much as even a half-baked Hammer film is still a lot of fun.  The one thing that did annoy me a little was the introduction of so many characters that really had little to do with story as a whole.  I didn't mind them being brought forth, but there was a sense within their presentation that they would be more integral than they actually were...a perfect example is that of the character of Paul, who is the primary focus as the film begins, only to disappear (we actually do see him later on hanging around the castle) about 20 minutes in basically turning into a plot device.  In terms of the characters, since there were so many of them packed into this 95-minute film, there wasn't a whole lot of room for development and, as others have mentioned, chemistry was lacking between Simon and Sara.  I did find it interesting how much attention was given to Dracula's manservant Uni-Brow aka Klove...talk about being used and abused (his relatively minor indiscretions elicited some very harsh punishments) .  His character did have a role within the story, but not one that would warrant the amount of screen time he had...although he was featured in one of my favorite scenes as he found himself in the position of having to clean up one of the Count's `messes'...using a hacksaw, meat cleaver, and other various implements.  As far as Lee, his screen presence is definitely menacing and authoritative, and has a comparatively copious amount of dialog compared to his previous cinematic appearances as Dracula...and then there are those red eyes as the bloodlust overtakes the character soon followed by the baring of the bitey fangs.  The special effects ranged from so-so (the goofy looking bats) to very effective (Dracula's eyes glowing through his lids as he slept).  Some have mentioned the film lacking the `gothic' feel of previous movies, and I would also agree, but while the atmosphere may not have been suitably oppressive, it still worked well for me to create a certain cinematic sense appropriate to the material.  Perhaps they didn't have the budget of previous films, but it did feel whatever they did have went towards the overall production, making the most of what they had...and that's one element I've felt generally consistent with Hammer productions is while they may have been restricted in one way or another, there never seemed to be a short supply of effort and heart put forth towards the material, along with a sense of a wanting to entertain audiences...but then that's just my opinion.

The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through clearly.  With regards to special features, there are plenty, enough to fill two discs, which is why a 2nd DVD is included.  On the DVD that contains the films is featured both a UK and US theatrical trailer for the film (the US trailer is actually a combo), poster and still gallery, talent bios, and a commentary track with Christopher Lee, director Roy Ward Baker, moderated by film historian Marcus Hearn.  On the 2nd disc is a 57-minute piece titled The Many Faces of Christopher Lee produced in 1995 featuring a reflective Lee in a personal setting talking about his lengthy career and providing all kinds of interesting details.  This is interspersed with clips from his films, behind the scenes footage, and still photographs.  He does come off as a little pompous at times, but he's certainly earned that right...also included are two music videos (?!) with Lee performing duet with someone named Gary Curtis...actually, the first video, featuring the songs `O Sole Mio/It's Now or Never, is a duet while the 2nd video, featuring a song titled `She'll Fall for Me' has Curtis doing most of the singing and Lee providing dialog within the song rather than singing.  Curiously interesting, to be sure...

573096,2,6303149189,"Hammer films are rarely unwatchable, but this is certainly not one of the studio's better efforts.

On the plus side, it is notable for restoring a few elements of Bram Stoker's original: The Count plays the icily charming host as well as the feral, demonic villain; he exerts supernatural power over wild animals; and he scales the walls of his castle like a bat. There are a few nice gothic flourishes here and there, too.

On the whole, however, the negatives outweigh the positives. The cast are dull, and there's no strong protagonist to rival, say, Peter Cushing or Andrew Keir from earlier on in the series. Even Christopher Lee is starting too look too old for the part by now. The effects are remarkably inconsistent, bordering on utterly silly at times, especially in the final showdown. Lastly, the sex and violence are often embarrassingly gratuitous, evidence of a film franchise in serious decline, from which it sadly never recovered. Both Hammer and director Baker (whose best work was probably the brilliantly suspenseful Quatermass and the Pit in 1967) were capable of far better.",1109980800,,1098,4.961956521739131
573097,5,6303149189,"""Scars of Dracula"" is a sort of 'odd man out' in the series of films released by Hammer Studios in that it has no place in the continuity (rather like the final film in the series, ""Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires"").  Basically, it re-writes the series as a sort of alternate ""part one"" ... therefore, it's a good place to start for anyone who hasn't seen any of these movies before.

""Scars"" opens unpromisingly, I must begin by saying, but a lame resurrection for Our Favorite Vampire is compensated by some unforgettable moments immediately following it ... there's the torching of Dracula's castle following his murder of a young girl by the frightened townspeople, who are then led by their priest to the church where they discover ... well, I can't really tell you, but you'll certainly never forget.  Some time passes following this incident, and we're soon introduced to a pair of brothers, the nice Simon and the naughty Paul (who's given a most amusing introduction), our protagonists for the remainder of the feature.  Paul finds himself, as a result of his high spiritedness, at Dracula's doorstep and up to his kneecaps in a sludge full of trouble, only to be followed soon afterward by Simon and the lovely girl both brothers are sweet on in an effort to save him.

Though the plot is rather thin, the film succeeds thanks to a number of striking images/scenes ... Drac gets a lot of lines, which is great because Christopher Lee has such a fantastic voice, there are some nice sets, particularly the bedroom where the stabbing occurs (love the red candles and curtains ... I want a room like that! and the stabbing, though unexplained in the movie, is certainly unforgettable).  There are also some nice moments like Paul's escape from that bedroom to Dracula's resting place in a virtually inaccessible crypt hollowed into the side of the mountain ... the mere idea of being trapped there with no way out, knowing it would be just a matter of time till Dracula wakes up and having no where to hide is just awful.  The sight of the former ""Doctor Who"" himself, Patrick Troughton, hacking up the corpse of Dracula's stabbing victim is hard to shake (I particularly like the way he whistles cheerfully to himself as he gets ready to do it, laying out his tools and setting down drop clothes in case any blood splatters).  Memorable too are the sight of Dracula's iris's glowing red from beneath his closed eyelids, along with the sequence featuring him spiderclimbing up the cliffside (which we also got to see in Francis Ford Coppola's version in 1992 ... but this movie did it first!).  The music is excellent, especially the violins we hear when Dracula mesmerizes his young female victims.  The climax of the film too is pretty nifty, with the cross-stealing bat (helpful friends, eh?), and a final act of God that helps Simon to put a stop to the vampire's mischief at the end (this isn't a spoiler ... don't tell me you really expected Dracula to win!).

""Scars of Dracula"" was the last of the Gothic Dracula films ... from the next film on, the films of the series would either be set in budget-saving modern-day England or turn of the century China (seriously!)  It works very well as an introduction to the series, as I said already, as it basically re-writes the back-story, making any of the previous films irrelevant, and as it was the last of its kind it works also as a nice stand-alone Dracula tale.

The DVD I purchased here at Amazon back in 2001 boasted some great extras, all of which were greatly enjoyed by me.  There are extensive biographies of both star Christopher Lee and director Roy Ward Baker (both containing a lot of ""Scars"" specific comments from both of them), trailers, nicely, NICELY animated menus a slideshow style photo gallery that lets the pictures float by automatically while some creepy music accompanies the images in the background, and a highly informative and critical commentary by both Mr. Lee himself and the director (who are not afraid to voice their dissatisfaction with parts of the film).  But the best extra of all comes in the form of a bonus disk ... it's a retrospective look on the career of Christopher Lee, given to us by the man himself as he looks into the camera and tells us about the various roles he was privileged to play over the years.  The best part comes at the end when he mentions his fellow horror film co-stars ""Peter"" and ""Vincent"".  Very sweet.

""Scars of Dracula"" is not a perfect movie (as several things are never explained and the bats still look fake), but it's a lot of fun, and the things it does right are done so well that they more than compensate for the things that aren't.  Do yourself a favor and buy a copy today.  This film and it's extras will keep you entertained for hours.

573098,5,6303149189,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. For one, Christopher Lee is the Best Dracula in this movie compared to all of his other dracula movies because he has the best lines. In addition, he is even a gentlemen at a point when he offers his guests some wine and a room to stay. But even so, as another viewer pointed out, this dracula movie does have the most violence compared to Lee's other dracula movies - but it just adds to the character of dracula - that he is evil!

Also, my husband noticed that this dracula movie has the most beautiful women. If you like dracula movies, especially the ones with Christopher Lee, then you have to get this one. It has a great story. Buy it now before it goes out of print - it's such a good movie. I watched the movie twice already for two days in a row.",1091404800,4,795,4.196078431372549

Sure Christopher Lee has more lines but they're awful lines and the film has absolutely zero artistry whereas the direction is concerned. The camerawork and photography have none of the excitement of the earlier Dracula films. The continuity is very bad indeed--night, now day, now...night again, all in the same sequence! The best set in the film is the bedroom with its black and deep red--a great looking set. Even on a low budget much can be done with lighting and camera angles, not to mention camera speeds and editing but apparently no one thought of those things when this film was made. This film is only slightly better than Dracula AD 1972, and not as good as Satanic Rites of Dracula which was awful. The only reason to own this DVD is if you're a Hammer completist. Then again, the commentary is mildly interesting because of Christopher Lee--also the bonus disc in interesting. In Dracula Prince of Darkness, Lee may have had no lines but it was an infinitely better looking film with more interesting characters and better direction by Terence Fisher.

573217,5,6303149189,"The first time I saw this movie was many years ago and I still  remember being in complete awe over the fact that it was so different than what I expected.  It was incredibly dark and sadistic (which was very uncharacteristic for Hammer Studios, let alone any other film up until this time) and it actually left a lasting impression on me for days.  The entire look and feel of the movie was somehow EXACTLY the way I had always pictured old horror movies to be.  I feel this is one of Hammer Studios best films and one of the best Dracula movies ever made. (which unfortunately isn't saying much.)

For once, Dracula gets to deliver some good dialouge and do some pretty cool things like scaling his castle walls, torturing his nim-witted servant, and might I also mention the inclusion of the most dramatic ""Dracula demise"" in the entire series.  Christopher Lee will always be the irreplaceable crown prince of terror and the one and only Dracula!  However, one has to wonder why Peter Cushing wasn't cast as the village priest.  His great acting and charisma always added a lot of needed credibility to these so called ""B grade"" imported horror films.

If you like castles, costumes, and old fashioned gothic horror films you need to give this one a try!  Just don't get yourself too upset over the fake looking bats!",1072828800,5,1321,4.630901287553648

I remembered the film as being much racier than it turns out to be. All-in-all, it's an entertaining Hammer Dracula entry with Christopher Lee in top form, more savage and sadistic than we've ever seen Dracula before. This is another film in which Hammer tried to inject a touch of Bram Stoker into the tale by having a hero held captive in Dracula's castle watch as the vampire scales the walls similar to the scene described in Stoker's book. The only real drawback here is that Dracula is pretty much castle-bound throughout the picture so all of the action comes to him.

It isn't clear what period or locale this is (I don't remember the end to ""To Drink the Blood..."") but it is obvious that the barmaids referring to the cops as ""pigs"" is an anachronism because Abbie Hoffman coined it a few years before this was made.
  You get a lot of stuff on this DVD, which is partly my justification for the impulse buy. You get the movie, an animate slide show and two trailers on the first disc, and Christofer Lee's Documentary and a couple of Music videos on the other.

573223,3,6303149189,"Though not considered one of the best by Hammer fans, Scars of Dracula is still an enjoyable vampire film.  It is dark and violent and at times twisted.  Lee himself has said on more than one occasion that this was his least favorite in the series, because of the violent nature of the film, and the acts of torture his character was directed to perform.  Yet, it is still very much the Hammer-style film, with luscious, colorful sets, ghothic atmoshere, and great performances by all the actors involved.  And in a way, Lee's Dracula here is more frightening than some of his other incarnations, because of his twisted, satanic ways.  He gives a feeling that Dracula could indeed originate from the lower regions of hell.
It would've been a better film with the reappearance of a Van Helsing type vampire hunter, like Cushing, or Andrew Keir (Dracula: Prince of Darkness), as the kill-scene is my least favorite of all the Lee/Dracula films.  But the DVD itself is beautiful, the picture quality near perfect, the sound clear and crisp.  And it is a well put together film.
The extras from Anchorbay, as usual, are far superior to anything anyone else (with the exception of Criterion, perhaps) includes with their DVDs.  There's an audio commentary with Lee and director Roy Ward Baker.  You get trailers, a poster gallery, and with the limited edition two disc set, you also get a neat and personal interview with Lee called ""The Many Faces of Christopher Lee"", and two totally cool music videos that Lee participated in.

As I warned you in my opening: ""Never wake the Count while he's asleep"". You may pay the consequences by watching a harmless and almost motionless Count Dracula, much less threatening than in his heydays.
I must admit I bought it because I am a faithful follower of Christopher Lee's career and as such it's part of his resume.
Unfortunately, someone decided to make him speak in this one.
Mind you, his voice is commanding as a bass-barytone and very suggestive, but Dracula seldom talks, he just commands by hypnotising his victims.
As the story goes, a young fellow has in mind to travel and stops at Castle Dracula for a night. Wrong choice of time and place...
Very soon a lovely (and voluptuous) girl begs him for help in order to escape the Count's attentions. The guy agrees and attempts to make love to the girl who very soon grows fond of his jugular and would like to take a bite, suddenly though, Dracula appears and a blood bath starts.
Change of scene. Next morning, everything is normal, no girl, no blood, but the young guy is obsessed with the idea of destroying Dracula.
He's so stupid as to lower himself, aided by the Count's manservant, into Dracula's Crypt. Guess what? He lands up spiked as a lamp post...
From there it's up to you to guess what else happens.
The attempt as being a ""Gothic"" version of the tale is not enough anymore. If the younger generations of the Victorian Age, as depicted in this movie, were truly such a bunch of stumbling and idiotic morons (which obviously they weren't), no wonder I was cheering all the time for the Count.
It's a mindless chapter in the Dracula/Lee series, only suited for those who follow the actor or are absolute fans of Dracula movies and must have it in their collections.
Otherwise stick to ""Horror of Dracula"", ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" and ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"". And only because it's the ideal continuation of the latter one, also ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"". But then just put a stake through his heart and throw the carcass to the wolves...
The three last installments including ""Dracula, A.D. 1972"" and ""The Satanic Rites of Count Dracula"" were just pale examples of movies made for the 1968 rebellious generation who wanted to part with the past and despised any authoritative figure, including The Prince of Darkness himself...
Unfortunately for them Dracula still lives and does what he does while they just became older if not ridicolously decrepit in their utopic views. Some even went so far that they replaced the old establishment with a much more devious and ruthless one. Exactly what Dracula stands for: bloodsucking and exploitation.
Think about it, it's very emblematic.

573312,4,6303149189,"For Scars of Dracula, Christopher Lee's 5th outing as the Count, Lee gets more screen time and dialogue than usual, but for most of its length SoD is only mildly diverting. The film has a drab, low-budget aura, and the script  is composed mostly of recycled ideas. Roy Ward Baker (director of a number of fine genre movies, e.g. Quatermass and the Pit, Asylum, Vampire Lovers), was apparently shocked by the sadism of Anthony Hinds' screenplay, and cynically decided to give Hammer what they wanted, accounting for the even greater emphasis on bloody violence than usual for a Hammer production. Unfortunately, the overall results don't come close to Baker's usually high standard. The normally sumptuous Hammer sets are cluttery and chintzy-looking and Moray Grant's cinematography is flat and TV-like; the whole movie really looks too bright and clean to generate any real gothic atmosphere. The miniature of Dracula's castle is fairly convincing (until it's set on fire), but the splatter makeups are simply wretched, and the mechanical bat might be more effective were it not so overused and overlit. Dennis Waterman and Jenny Hanley generate little chemistry or charisma as the hero and heroine, and Patrick Troughton as Klove is just sort of there with no explanation whatsoever (though it's nice to see Michael Ripper in a bit larger part than usual as the innkeeper). Also on the plus side: a few effective action sequences and shocks, Hanley and Anouska Hempel are gorgeous, and Delia Lindsay reveals her derriere early in the film (the only bit of nudity in a movie that could've used more, if only to liven things up). Surprisingly, just when you think the movie's a goner, things pick up at the climax: Dracula's eyes glowing through his eyelids (a very eerie effect), a brief shot of Lee crawling up the castle wall as in Stoker's novel, and a rousing pyrotechnic finale. But it's pretty much a case of ""too little too late."" Scars really makes me appreciate the freshness and style of Freddie Francis' Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (so far MIA on DVD). While not as disastrous as some have described, Scars of Dracula just barely aces Prince of Darkness for least of the Hammer Draculas (up to that point anyway). Check out Anchor Bay's excellent Dr. Jekyll & Sister Hyde or Quatermass and the Pit DVDs to see what Roy Ward Baker can do with a well-written, original script and decent production values.
Hammer completists, Chris Lee fans, and Dracula/vampire cultists will no doubt want this for their movie collections anyway and for those hardy souls Anchor Bay once again delivers the goods. The source print for the 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is virtually flawless, with excellent brightness, contrast, detail, and sharpness, and richly saturated, well-balanced color. There are virtually no noticeable physical defects. Extras include a very clean 1.85:1 letterboxed British release trailer, rather shabby-looking letterboxed American release combo trailer (with Horror of Frankenstein), poster/still gallery, talent bios for Lee and Baker, and an audio commentary by the star and director, moderated by Hammer historian Marcus Hearn. Erudite and opinionated, Lee tends to dominate the discussion, but all three contribute plenty of interesting information about the film and many other topics (mostly Hammer-related) as well. My copy of this DVD also came with a special `limited edition' bonus disc featuring a 1995 documentary ""The Many Faces of Christopher Lee."" Rather than the expected tired rehash of Lee's film appearances, the hour-long program is actually a pleasant surprise, as Christopher Lee literally invites us into his home, displays prized memorabilia and photos, relates personal anecdotes (on such wide-ranging subjects as his operatic ancestors,  Bela Lugosi's ring, Rasputin, Vincent and Peter, and Fu Manchu), and even gives brief lessons on fencing and gunfighting, all interspersed with numerous clips from his films. The bonus disc also includes two lame music videos by some really cheesy lounge act co-featuring Mr. Lee (he duets on O Sole Mio/It's Now or Never in one). You'll probably view these once out of curiosity and never look at them again. In total another fine package from Anchor (unfortunately one that makes you wish the movie itself was as meticulously crafted).

573313,3,6303149189,"I don't understand why Hammer made this movie. The others follow a sequential pattern, more or less (ok less!) that this one doesn't fit. THe basic story revolves around the eternal love triangle and throw in Dracula. An older brother loves a girl who loves the younger, ne'er-do-well brother. The younger brother leaves town, after being too friendly with the Burgermeister's daughter and ends up at dracula's castle.
The older brother and the girl travel to find him and end up in Dracula's castle. The younger brother is found dead, gruesomely killed, and in a fiery ending, Dracula is immolated and the castle collapses.
Dracula has more lines in this one and it does show that vampires aren't the suave, debonair misunderstood victims of a blood disease. Dracula is cruel, sadistic, maniacal and Lee does a good job portraying him so. The dismemberment scene is done with excruciating detail, unlike a similiar one in Taste the blood of Dracula. The blood splatters, used to show that Dracula drank blood and it got all over the place, are fake looking and unimpressive. I think the original intent was to show the dark side of vampires, not the sanitized portrayal of the other films but it failed in presenting a coherent whole. Rather it was a disjointed production that looked slapped together for a drive-in double feature. Lots of potential that went unrealized.
The scenery is scant and cardboard-like, with very little attempt at realism. The actors are wooden, except for Lee, and you end up not caring whether they live or die. The ending is contrived and you wonder, where did all these people come from?

For one thing, the commentary features director Roy Ward Baker and star Christopher Lee, and their reminiscences alone are worth the price of the DVD.  Particularly amusing are Lee's veiled barbs at Baker's less-than-stellar direction, and the two aging gentlemen's blatant plugs for their (then recently published) books. Better still, the package includes a bonus DVD, THE MANY FACES OF CHRISTOPHER LEE, which includes some good clips, Lee's own always-interesting commentary, and a touching little tribute to his departed friends, ""Peter and Vincent"".  The bonus disc is a must for any fan of this sadly underappreciated actor.
As for the film itself, we had a right to expect much better from Roy Ward Baker, who gave us the marvellous A NIGHT TO REMEMBER before his Hammer days.  His best work for the studio (QUATERMASS AND THE PIT, DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE, the opening sequence of THE VAMPIRE LOVERS) is on a level with their very finest films, but when he's bad - well, he's bad.  (MOON ZERO TWO, anyone?)  Baker isn't quite at his worst with this picture, but neither is he far from it.
Nearly everyone who discusses SCARS OF DRACULA feels the need to praise its famous ""Dracula climbing up the wall"" sequence.  If you ask me, this bit is just plain silly.  Lee's got his rear end sticking up in the air the whole time, and the director of photography didn't even bother turning his camera so that the wall looks vertical.  Despite its fame, it's actually a pretty shoddy scene. Then again, this is overall a fairly shoddy movie...
Fortunately, however, Lee's customary professionalism, along with a couple of semi-interesting scenes, make SCARS OF DRACULA at least watchable.  Don't expect too much from the movie, and make the most of the DVD extras, and you won't regret the purchase.",1007596800,6,1976,4.854166666666667

The production values aren't as grand as earlier Hammer films, but the performance by Lee and scenes borrowed from Stoker's novel give this film considerable power. Roy Ward Baker does an admirable job stepping into Terry Fisher (or Freddie Francis) shoes. Baker, who directed the classic Hammer film Quatermass & The Pit (aka Five Million Years to Earth--a bizarre title for such a fine film)creates considerable tension in some of the most powerful scenes in the film
Anchor and Bay have done their typically meticulous job in restoring the film. The bonus of having both Lee and Baker for the audio commentary makes this a great addition to any Hammer film buff's collection. I'd have to rate this just behind Horror of Dracula (still not available on DVD--are you listening Warner Brothers?)and just before Terry Fisher's fine sequel Dracula Prince of Darkness.
After this film the Count was in need of a transfusion. Sadly, it was the wrong blood type. Hammer chose to bring the Count into the 20th century. It could have been a brave move if Hammer had chosen quality writers and directors to work the material. Dracula became little more than a glorified Fu Manchu in the rest of the films and, by the end, Lee could have sleepwalked through the roles despite the return of Peter Cushing. It was another missed opportunity.",1003104000,9,1467,4.7795275590551185

But don't let that stop you from buying this cult classic. I think that this film is the best in the series next to Horror of Dracula and contains some scenes that were straight from the novel, one of which has Dracula crawl down the wall of his castle. There is also a graphic scene which reflects Dracula as Vlad Tepes in which one of Dracula's victims is found impaled on the castle wall.

Released in 1970, shortly after ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"", ""Scars of Dracula"" is violent and sadistic, with a rapid pace throughout. An attractive young couple spends the night at a gloomy old castle, and well...guess what! Right out of Bram Stoker, the Count crawls straight up the tower wall. But rubber bats and night and day scene jump cuts damage the final result. ""Scars"" was the first ""R"" rated Hammer release in the U.S.. A clear, crisp DVD from an excellent source, the print is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. ""Scars"" has an audio commentary with the director and Lee himself. The horror star looks back on his years at Hammer and plugs his new book. But there's treasure here! If you're a true Lee fan, you must have the extra DVD, ""Many Faces of Christopher Lee(not available on all releases)"".  The 65 minute film, made by the BBC in 1995, is a masterful walk down the Christopher Lee career, and narrated by the star himself. It includes clips from many of his 250 film roles. Lee started in 1948, with a bit part as a spear carrier in ""Hamlet"", and will appear in the 2002 release of ""Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones"". In the documentary, he examines Dracula and Bela Lugosi, comedic moments from the Fu Manchu films, and memories of SNL and John Belushi. 2 videos are included; giving you scenes of Lee dancing and singing 3 songs.

But if you can avoid comparing the film to the studio's earlier, superior films (particularly those helmed by Terence Fisher), you might just find a decent horror movie waiting to be discovered.

This small but effective film is one that he was fond of, however, if only due to the attempt to return to at least some of the themes and set pieces introduced in Bram Stoker's original novel (the scene of Dracula in full regalia climbing DOWN the sheer face of the castle wall like a bat is a standout). Although certainly not up to the classic standards of HORROR OF DRACULA or even the inferior DRACULA,PRINCE OF DARKNESS, this would be Lee's last period incarnation of the character before the whacked-out 70's versions that would forever bury the series.

The film itself is the last of the Hammer Dracula's set in ""Victorian"" times before the update in ""Dracula AD 1972"".  The plot is typical Hammer vampire fare, and Dracula has very little to do here but bare his fangs and snarl.  Lee, as always, invests his portrayal of the Count with glaring evil...but he seems tired of the entire affair.  The film is considered by many to be the nastiest of the Hammer Dracula films, which may be true.  Overall, it is a very average film and it you are not a serious Lee/Hammer/Dracula collector, you might prefer the DVD version of ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"".",992649600,,830,4.574324324324325
573390,5,6303149189,"This entry in the series is perhaps the best, though it can be surpassed by HORROR OF DRACULA in some respects. A young couple runs afoul of the revived Count Dracula and his servant Klove, while in search of the man's missing brother. This film benefits greatly by an original and more elaborate screenplay, and Lee's phenomonal performance. Dracula is once again a more central character, giving him more to do and better lines. Lee gives his GREATEST performance yet, even though he personally disliked doing alot of Dracula films. Hammer also borrowed Universal's classic ""firey mob"" sequence for this film's opening, which also adds some early excitment as the mob of villagers attempts to end Dracula's reign by burning his castle. More is borrowed from Stoker's novel, such as Dracula scaling the castle walls and his vampire bats, whom he commands. This film is a bit gorier and has more sex than its predecessors, but don't let that stop you from buying this film(the gross scenes are few and brief). The night scenes filmed in daylight didn't bother me. Who cares? When you see Dracula awake, its night, so it doesn't matter. It helps the mood. The scenes outside the castle are dark, others are more light. This entry is very eerie, and well acted. Dracula's demise, while unorthodox, is the most original and is pretty cool!! Don't waste time, get SCARS OF DRACULA. It's the best example of Lee as Dracula, and is perhaps the darkest of the series!",987811200,9,1460,4.820717131474104

Well, critics of an  almost Leeless predecessor, this one delivers for you because Lee is given  more to do in this one. This one was the last Hammer Dracula to take place  in the 19th century.

As time and the series progressed, sexual content was more overt.  However, the delectable burgomaster's daughter and her bare bottom are as  ""PG"" as things get.  Some of the bloody murders may be too  gruesome for younger viewers.  The towering, menacing presence of  Christopher Lee, dressed in the familiar flowing black cape, is the film's  great allure.  Lee's demonic demeanor transmits a spellbinding threat to  sanity in each dreadful glare.  Young women with deep cleavage are  particularly vulnerable to his mesmerizing influence, as if that's a  surprise!  Dracula's hypnotic tendrils excite the bestial instincts of bats  and wolves, a throwback to Bram Stoker's version of the character.  The  plot elements, from the blood induced resurrection at the beginning of the  film to the mysterious seductive woman that inhabits Dracula's castle, have  been seen before.  Once again, unwitting victims spend the night in Castle  Dracula.  These familiar factors blend together in an entertaining way that  holds the viewer's interest.  Dracula's spectacular fate is electrifying  and compensates the viewer for a few technical flaws (e.g., the fake bats,  the ""night"" scenes clearly filmed in daylight, etc.).  This is  the last of the Hammer Dracula films set in the 19th century.  The series  went ""modern"" in 1972.  Hammer horror fans and those who want a  change from the ""insane killer stalking teenagers"" type suspense  flick will enjoy this movie.  For best results watch it as the wind moans  through the trees while a distant dog howls at things going bump in the  night.  An approaching thunderstorm would be a nice touch.

Lousy production gimmicky unconvincing effects and those awful bats. Why Hammer had to  resort to copying Universal is beyond me.  No wonder the great Mr Lee got  sick of Hammer using the Count in daft storylines and having to speak  ludricrous dialogue. The only good points are Hammer regular Michael Ripper  as a suspicious publican and the ending in which Dracula is struck by  lightning. I was also very surprised at director Roy Ward Baker who had  directed such Hammer classics as ""Quatermass and the Pit"" and  ""Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde"" was he not bothered?

573394,3,6303149189,"Scars is the final gothic entry in Hammer's Dracula series. The film starts with the towns people setting fire to castle Dracula in an attempt to kill him. A young man fleeing the law comes to the castle seeking refuge for a night, he is taken in, but we do not learn his fate at this point. The man's brother and his girlfriend go in search of the missing man and they to end up at the castle where Dracula greets them and sets his sights on the women. The main stregnth of this film is that Dracula was given a lot more to do than in the three previous movies and Christopher Lee makes the best of it. The overall plot is simple, but effective and the film has a very strong ending. The problems with this film are the horrible rubber bats, the overuse of day for night scenes and even the fog behind the castle is an unmoving backdrop that looks like a leftover from a high school play. The makers of the film tried to cut corners and their cheapness hurts this film because it detracts some from the story. This film is still very worthwhile and probably the third best in the series behind Horror and Brides.
  Above is what I wrote about the vhs tape, but I have since gotten the dvd. If you already think it is a confused mees than this will not interest you. The dvd provides a very sharp version that puts the vhs version to shame. The extras include trailers, stills and a commentary with Roy Ward Baker and Christoper Lee. The commentary has some interesting comments early on, but quickly strays from the film and turns into Lee ranting about how ""they don't make horror films like they used to"". The bonus Christopher Lee biography disc is very well done as it touches on a number of his movies and he reflects on them. A good job by Anchor Bay.",946252800,,1758,4.292168674698795
573395,3,6303149189,"""scars of Dracula"" is a film that is much better suited to Hammer/Christopher Lee fans than the general viewing public. It does have much to offer, but it most certainly is a drop in quality from earlier  films in the series. Here's the good:
1) DracuLee is given more to do,  much more. He displays the icy charm Hammer-Heads have come to love. 2) The  movie reeks with atmosphere in spots. Lee climbing up the wall, his eyes  glowing thru his eyelids, etc... 3) Although the photography is strangely  flat, the vibrant reds do show up in several scenes.
There are several  things working against the movie as well:
1) The  ""day-for-night"" photography is atrocious! It's always too bright.  Plus, there are several scenes where it's bright outside, but as soon as  people are near the castle the skies are suddenly dark. 2) The rubber bats  leave alot to be desired (although the scenes of the bat chewing on the  priest's face are unsettling). 3) The movie features ""young""  stars. The strongest Hammer films had adults in the lead roles.
Overall,  I really enjoy ""Scars of Dracula"", although I'm not sure if  that's a truly objective opinion. I'm a Hammer-Head and I proudly admit it.  Try it for yourself---just don't go in expecting ""Horror of  Dracula"".

This is despite the fact that he refused to speak In the picture, finding his lines of dialog to be inane. Yet his presence, the excellent supporting cast and Terrence Fisher's direction make it worth watching. The sumptuous Hammer Films look continued to sustain the series right up to this, the fifth film to star Lee in the title role. Lee had input into a number of aspects of the movie, particularly his dialog and the highly effective segment in which the count crawls eerily up the castle wall (which was taken directly from Stoker's novel). The cast is first-rate and includes Patrick Troughton (Dr. Who #2), Dennis Waterman (""New Tricks""), Michael Gwynn (""Revenge of Frankenstein"") and the always reliable Michael Ripper. Despite the accolades bestowed upon the ""more faithful""  Harry Alan Towers/Jesus Franco production, ""Count Dracula,"" the latter film's only striking attribute is the de-aging of Dracula over the course of the story. Otherwise, It is an uneven, turgid movie. In comparison, even ""Brides of Dracula,"" which shifted the focus to vampire hunter Peter Cushing (reprising his role as Van Helsing), was more enjoyable and energetic. Despite being cited as marking the beginning of the decline of the series, ""Scars"" is consistently involving and gives Lee his most lines of dialog since the 1958 original. It is a praise-worthy follow-up to ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"" and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula."" Say what you will about them, the Hammer Dracula movies are genuinely  entertaining -- right up to and including the final two films in the series, which reunite Lee with Cushing, yet are hampered by their modern-day settings.
