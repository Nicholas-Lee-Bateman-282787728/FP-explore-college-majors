7864012,3,6304192282,Maybe it's a culture thing-- this movie was odd but compelling. Anyone who works with preteens will recognize the switch from fantasy to reality and back that the story presents. The depiction of grief is spot on as well.,1369958400,2,221,4.6923076923076925
7864013,5,6304192282,"This DVD is currently available in Region 4 PAL format and you would need an all-region DVD player to view it.  Hence this review too comes from the cinematic version, seen about twenty years ago, but that's okay 'cause I'm from New Zealand, and Vincent Ward's movies remain fresh in many of our minds.  'Vigil' is a powerful coming-of-age tale about a young girl, darkly, starkly, and beautifully shot in the back country by a young director at his peak.  One of the best lines in the film was delivered to god ""Beans up yer bum!""  There, a direct quotation, not bad after twenty years.  It's a movie you're gonna love or hate, pretty much the reaction Ward has engendered throughout his career.  At the time of its release, the British press wrote 'Vigil' off, and condescendingly implied that it came from a country where a new tractor would make headlines.  Ward's other major movies that are also available are 'The Navigator' (not to be confused with 'Flight of...') 'Map of the Human Heart,' and his newest, 'River Queen.'  His disasterous forays into Hollywood include half of 'Aliens 3' and 'What Dreams May Come' with Robin Williams.",1196208000,7,1143,4.766497461928934
7864014,5,6304192282,"I am heartbroken that this DVD is not region 1 or open region-code.  This is not a review of the DVD, therefore, but of the film. This film changed my life, literally. From the dwelling, halucinigenic passages, to the hypnotic soundtrack, to the wrenching personal transformations at its heart; this film will take you, if you let it, into the heart of a girl at the edge of womanhood. If you watch it, give it its due; and see it big screen, with good sound, and the best in attention enhancements.

The gorgious New Zealand back-country scenery is only a small part of the attraction. The characterizations are second-to-none, and not least is the role of young Toss, by Fiona Kay. The other players are excellent, but are inevitably overshadowed by Kay in the lead role.

As with many early masters, one wonders whether the director will ever again produce a film with the scope and focus, the effortless sweep and statement, of this one. If he does not, i for one forgive him. Vigil is enough.",1127001600,9,997,4.621468926553672
7864015,3,6304192282,"This movie is obviously low budget and the plot is thin, but it makes up for this somewhat with its contemplative look at a girl coming of age and its haunting portrayal of the New Zealand contryside.  It won't keep most  people's attention unless you are used to this type of film.  Overall, it  is a good effort, but could have been better with more money and work, as  well as a tighter plot.  The young girl is an excellent actress.",940291200,,436,4.320987654320987
7864016,5,6304192282,"so you want to see where jane campion borrowed images for the piano? this exquisite movie by vincent ward will show you...a meditation on the transition from child to adult, this is a powerful and inventive movie with  visuals that will tear your heart out. the soundtrack is quirky and  beautiful...vincent ward is a genius from downunder and i'm sorry to see  him at the helm of the much castigated ""what dreams may come""-  someone please wake up and give this man some really great material,and  watch him soar! ""vigil"" will make a stunning dvd, but fox lorber  must do a better job on it than they have on their current crop of dvd  releases.",921110400,10,646,4.565217391304348
