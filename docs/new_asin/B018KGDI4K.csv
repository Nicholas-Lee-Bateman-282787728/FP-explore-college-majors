8742598,3,B018KGDI4K,"I have a photo I prize of my wife and myself standing before the tomb of this American Indian saint, Saint Kateri Tekakwitha. Admiring her, I was quick to order this movie after it came out. There are some things to be said in its favor. The acting is excellent, especially of the French missionary who lived in her village and of the uncle who adopted her after her parents died, who is portrayed as the strong, silent type.
  However, I found this movie, overall, disappointing. The first great portion of this movie is a portrayal of the life of this Indian tribe to which she belonged, with too little about her, and I found this part of the movie rather tiresome. The movie also is poorly planned, showing little about her holiness until the last few minutes of the movie, when suddenly it is brought out as if to catch up on the earlier failure to well portray this about her. Before this she seems a good person, but someone to canonize? Much showing her holiness is left out of the movie.
  This movie has also succumbed to the temptation of those who make movies about saints of inventing incidents or changing them to make the movie more interesting, which, personally, I find annoying.
  I expect though that some people will like seeing this movie in spite of such fundamental flaws, and so I rated it as ""okay.""
  I still will await a movie doing this saint justice.",1472428800,4,1379,4.51004016064257
