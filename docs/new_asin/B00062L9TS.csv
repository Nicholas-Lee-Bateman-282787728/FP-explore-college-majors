It's really high energy and even funny.  Anybody would enjoy watching this but if you ride sideways it's a must have.  I just wish I could find the soundtrack!",1106092800,10,314,4.271186440677966

8037533,5,B00062L9TS,"I love Shaun White. The White Album is very good and the soundtrack is amazing. I can't hear ""Blinded by the Light"" without thinking of Shaun coasting on the snow.",1332115200,,163,4.466666666666667
8037534,2,B00062L9TS,Way too short.  I actually bought this by accident not knowing it's the same as another DVD but with a different cover.,1220745600,,119,4.409090909090909
8037535,5,B00062L9TS,There are some great footage of the flying tomatoe but it is way too short.  I'm not into skateboarding as footage of this sport is included as well as snowboarding.,1220745600,,165,4.5
8037536,5,B00062L9TS,Great DVD if your a Shaun White's fan. A little bit short for my expectations but still very good,1202688000,,97,4.157894736842105
8037537,2,B00062L9TS,"I bought this dvd assuming it was going to be great. Shawn White is an excellent rider and the reviews were mostly 5 stars. I ws kinda dissapointed when i first saw it. the soundtrack isn't that great, mostly older songs from the early 90's i think.  The riding wasn't all that great either and was more like a videography on shawn white. it didn't show much af any other riders and the special features were like watching a target commercial.",1191888000,,443,4.469135802469136

8037539,5,B00062L9TS,"This is no typical snowboard video. If any of you have ever seen a typical snowboarding video then this album would blow you out of the water (or snow). First of all, its Shaun White, easily the best snowboarder in the world (by age 17). Second, its freakin Shaun White!! Most soundtracks on surf, skate, snow videos are mediocre to say the very least. The soundtrack on this album has provoked thousands (including me) to search far and low for a compilation of this mindboggling mix of music mayhem. Also, if you did not notice, 60% of the stuff that Shaun pulls on this video have never been done by anyone else in the world. Everything is fluid and incredibly steezy! Although this kid is not the ugliest kid in the world (he does come close) he makes up for it by being the only person in the world to medal in two different X games sports. Unbelievable!! Nice gold medal by the way, that means he has won the last nine pipe events that he has entered. Not too shabby. Anyways, if you do not own this album at least you won't be able to appreciate what is portrayed inside of it. Sorry for ending that last sentence on a preposition, I can ride but I can't write.",1141171200,6,1168,4.337899543378995
