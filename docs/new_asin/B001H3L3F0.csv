But as always Cerebral & Brilliant!! I've watched it over and over. I Love his delivery and style!!
*I've also seen him live and met him several times!! He is not only Funny - but a Good guy too!! Scott M.",1480291200,,349,4.072463768115942
8307757,5,B001H3L3F0,This is a terrific half-hour comedy. Fans of Steven Wright will love it. I feel compelled to mention that the DVD is officially available from Mr. Wright's own website for $14.95. They apparently no longer have the DVD cover--you will only receive the disc itself (and a DVD-R at that). But the price is certainly much more reasonable than what sellers are trying to make here.,1305331200,14,377,4.7272727272727275
