You can't make this stuff up! Good belly laughs!",1383868800,,114,3.75
7905889,4,6303535127,"This video is great family fun.  It contains great bloopers from baseball, basketball, football, soccer, horse racing, hockey, boxing, pranks, and of course, animals.

Is there cheesy music and goofy sound effects?  Yes.  Are some of the pranks stupid?  Yes!  Are some of the bloopers actually painful to watch instead of funny?  Yes! (Nothing overly gruesome, but a couple of rodeo moments).  Despite all of these factors, there are some great bloopers.  Favorites include the ""Bark like a dog"" basketball play, the boxer's mother who storms into the ring to defend her son, and of course, the Stanford/Cal ""Band on the field"" play.

The real reason this tape did not get five stars is because it does not (except for only a couple of clips) show any professional sports bloopers.  The bloopers are either from college games/minor leagues or from high school games.  Charles Barkley is touted on the back of the video, but he only appears in a prank against Manute Bol.  Hey, I'm sure its expensive to have gotten the rights to professional sports bloopers from all the organizations, but it certainly ensure that this video cannot have ALL the best bloopers.

That said, this video has been viewed and enjoyed by all ages, sports enthusiasts or not (have you ever seen a hippo race?).  It's also good, clean slapstick fun, a video you will enjoy watching repeatedly.",1094515200,2,1368,4.886956521739131
7905890,4,6303535127,This Blooper video lives up to its name. Definately worth the money. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. If you like non-stop sports bloopers and fun-this tape is for you.,970272000,4,180,4.484848484848484
