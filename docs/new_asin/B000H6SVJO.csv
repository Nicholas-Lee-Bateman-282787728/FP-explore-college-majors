8626631,1,B000H6SVJO,"This by far is THE WORST DVD on the market.  I could only sit through 15 minutes before I shut it off.  The information is poorly presented, and he rarely even talks about trigger points.  My 8 year old could have done better then he did.  Don't waste your time on this, it is not worth the money at all!",1170201600,12,304,4.016666666666667
8626632,2,B000H6SVJO,"There's a LONG DVD movie, without posibility of searching the diferent chapters. You need to watch all the movie if you want to look for what you need. The explanations are poor and I am not satisfied with the product, as I expected.",1168300800,9,233,4.441860465116279
8626633,1,B000H6SVJO,"Like human nerds, this DVD is very smart and full of facts, but also like human nerds, it is awkward and disorganized.

This is officially the worst, most poorly produced DVD I have ever seen.  It consists 100% of a male therapist's disembodied (disenheaded?) hands working on a demo person while methodically listing muscle names, origins, insertions, and actions.  Most of the times he will remember to talk about a trigger point for a muscle, but not always!  The DVD is practically useless as a reference tool since the two hour DVD is only separated into two chapters: anterior and posterior.  What a pain in the neck if you quickly want to look up something for a particular client!  The absolute nadir of the DVD occurs approximately 45 minutes into it.  The speaker introduces the rectus femoris, but then messes up.  Instead of deleting the goof, the DVD simply has a `do-over'.  Unbelieveable!  Either there was absolutely no editor at all for this DVD, or it was just so incredibly boring that the editor just fast-forwarded and skimmed!  What a waste of my time and money!!!!",1167436800,12,1087,4.790322580645161
