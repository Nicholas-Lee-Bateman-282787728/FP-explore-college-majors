8226298,5,B000X0BRC2,"I remember seeing this movie in my early married life back in the early 80's.  This is a wholesome family movie with cute acting and a wonderful story.  Could someone please help me find either a new or used dvd, or if unavailable, would be willing to obtain a good used VCR version.  All assistance is greatly appreciated!!!",1345852800,,325,4.568965517241379

8226300,5,B000X0BRC2,"I Really miss these older movies from the 1980's.  I would love to have this one on DVD.  It was about a young boy (Gary Coleman) living in a train station.  If I remember correctly he sleeps in a locker.  He is alone, with no family, and learns to survive living in the train station and if I recall he is afraid to leave the train station.  Many other famous people are his friends in this movie.  Please, please consider putting this one out on DVD, I think it would do well. It does have a happy ending.  It is a cute movie.",1313625600,7,528,4.067961165048544
