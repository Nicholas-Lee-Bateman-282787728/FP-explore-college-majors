Bodydonnas V. Smoking Gunns

OK, the Gunns are Tag Team Champions...why the hell aren't the title on the line?...I don't get it. horrible match that saw one of the donnas getting his ass kicked and then out of no where is a roll up and a win for the donnas. Stupid. *3/4

Mankind V. Henry O. Godwinn

another horrible match that had nothing to it. Mankind wins. *

Marc Mero V. Stone Cold Steve Austin

good match but they had a better match at the King Of The Ring. Austin wins. ***

Goldust V. Undertaker

another good match. Taker wins by DQ after Mankind once again goes after Taker. *** ok...didn't Mick already beat Taker at King Of The Ring?...So...why would he still have a problem with Undie? You would think it would by the other way around...whatever

Shawn Micahels, Ahmed Johnson, & Psycho Sid

V.

Vader, British Bulldog, & Owen Hart

Warrior was suppose to be in this but he no showed like ten events and vince fired him yet again so Sid is in there and Sid gets the biggest pop of the night! WOW! Ok...the match was awesome and got ever better when Shawn & Owen were in there. Vader beats the WWF Champion (who was Michaels at the time for the morons out there) with the Vadebomb to set up the main event for Summerslam. ****

overalll, a watchable show with two horrible matches, two average matches and one awesome match.",1138665600,,1452,4.526923076923077
