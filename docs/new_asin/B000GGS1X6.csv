8131944,5,B000GGS1X6,"As a college Disability Services Coordinator, this is one of my favorite training resource.  Although the students interviewed are high school students, their description of their experiences applies very well to college students.  I have used it over a number of years for training residence life staff, tutors, and other peers.  Not only does it provide specific information on interacting with those on the autism spectrum, but it is useful in raising general awareness of hidden disabilities.",1425427200,,496,5.415584415584416

8131946,5,B000GGS1X6,"As a social cognitive and speech therapist, I was lucky to find the series of Coulter Videos.  They are immensely useful and practical tools by which to educate teachers, administrators, parents, siblings and general education classmates about the challenges of having neurodiversities (Asperger's Syndrome, ADD, ADHD, Nonverbal Learning Disorder, Pdd-Nos, Autism).  These videos are affordable and give easily understood visual examples of what is happening for individuals with social, organizational and/or sensory challenges.....and how a neurotypical person might be helpful in daily interaction.  Coulter Video is a family run business with unique, quality products that can be used to make a difference for people every where.  Customer service cannot be beat.

8131947,5,B000GGS1X6,"This was authentic, informative and touching. It is brief, just 12 minutes. The students with Asperger's come across as having dignity and humanity. Everybody with AS will relate to some of what they say, and others will get a glimpse into the mind and experience of people with this condition. My favorite line was when the narrator, an excellent young man who has AS himself, says ""How do you know if someone has Asperger's Syndrome? Well, does it really matter?"" We should treat everyone with humanity and see past the surface of the problems someone may have.",1384646400,,563,4.814432989690721
8131948,4,B000GGS1X6,"I used this DVD in my son's high school class as a ""teachable moment"" when I was educating them about him having Aspergers Syndrome, and to let them know what the syndrome is all about.  The video is presented very informatively, but with humor and empathy for all those with differences.  Since it is narrated largely by teens I felt my sons' classmates got a good understanding of the subject matter and then we had a springboard for a discussion afterward.  I definitely would recommend this DVD for the start of understanding of Aspergers Syndrome!",1267401600,2,552,4.7894736842105265
