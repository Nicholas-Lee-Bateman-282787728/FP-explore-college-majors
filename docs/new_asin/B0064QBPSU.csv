8492782,1,B0064QBPSU,"For the money I spent on this one I expected a much better job with production, flow, set design, etc. Very unprofessionally done, very little instruction for anyone who knows very little about form. I'm not a beginner in fitness but if u are I would steer clear from this. I will be selling this one. Sorry but I have to be honest. The woman you are suppose to follow for low impact you can't see her from poor production going in & out. Don't I repeat Don't waste your money on this crappy production cd.",1434585600,,506,4.28125
8492783,5,B0064QBPSU,"These workouts are so fun!  I have 2 adopted daughters ages 2 & 5.  Both are African American and I bought this so that they can have yet another positive African American women to emulate.  This video provides that for us along with a lot of fun.  The three of us work out together, each performing on our own level of movement & skill level and we have a blast.  Each of us gets a workout.  The music is energetic and it's fun to watch the children behind the instructor do the workout.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a taste of African Dance.",1389571200,,552,4.2
