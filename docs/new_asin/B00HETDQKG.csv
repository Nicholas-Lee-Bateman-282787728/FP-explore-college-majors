6160450,2,B00HETDQKG,"I was already prejudiced against the story when I learned it was penned by that horrible Klansman, Asa Earl (a.k.a. Forrest) Carter.  Remember, he wrote George Wallace's most famous and hateful speech.  But the opening montage of riders firing pistols from horseback with no close targets, then the river ferry scene were so ridiculous that I gave up.  The redlegs had imitators who committed many crimes, but Quantrill of the Bushwhackers was at least as bad, and a slavery advocate.  Watch ""Ride with the Devil"" for a powerful, accurate story about the conflict.",1504569600,,564,5.032258064516129
