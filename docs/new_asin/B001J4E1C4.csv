3652076,5,B001J4E1C4,"As a high school student working at a local pizza pub in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Papa John's founder John Schnatter realized that there was something missing from national pizza chains; a superior-quality traditional pizza delivered to the customer's door. His dream was to one day open a pizza restaurant that would fill that void.

In 1983, ""Papa"" John Schnatter delivered his last campus pizza, picked up his business degree from Ball State University, and went back to Jeffersonville, Indiana. There, at age 22, he knocked down the broom closet in his father's tavern (Mick's Lounge), sold his prized 1972 Z28 Camaro, purchased $1,600 worth of used restaurant equipment, and began delivering pizzas out of the back of the bar.

Papa John's opened its first pizza restaurant in 1985 and to this day is committed to delivering on its brand promise of ""Better Ingredients. Better Pizza."" Papa John's is the recognized quality leader of the pizza category and now owns or franchises over 3,000 restaurants worldwide.

3652082,5,B001J4E1C4,"This show is just plain great.  It is able to take things out of the world that may seem terrible on the surface, and then ease one's mind by showing the absurdity and humanity of the things it, ""spoofs"".  They do this primarily with the theme of business and public access videos.  They also succesfully do the same with father-son relationship issues (seriously), segments of American culture, and comedy itself.

Looking at UK reviews of these shows, I'm surprised at the particular British comedians some people liken them to (they definitely draw from British comedy however).  They obviously have a broad knowledge of comedy, and the show reflects that.  I'd say those that would appreciate Tim and Eric the most are comedy nerds.  Despite not starting out in the stand-up world, Tim and Eric fit snugly into the indie comedy mold.  Those that appreciate those comedians, will also appreciate this.

The one thing that bugs me about this show are the fake commercials.  They are called, ""Cinco commercials"", and are usually just as funny as the fake commercials many of us made as kids when we got our hands on a camcorder.

I'd recommend seasons 1-3, and 95% of the online material they produce.  It seems they are currently slowing down on projects starring themselves.  I can't imagine that they can keep a brand of comedy fresh for years on end, I don't really know of anyone that can.  I guess that's when you move onto a different genre form, who knows.",1342051200,,1465,4.761904761904762

3652095,5,B001J4E1C4,"I grow very tired of having to explain my love for this show to people who seem offended by it's very existence.

To sum it up, dumb it down, and wrap it in a convienent ""awkward"" little package for people who constantly feel the need to question the merit of this shows humor, I will give examples of WHY the show appeals to me:

1) I enjoy the shows vibrant use of colors. This may seem irrelevant or a ridiculous reason to some, but I find the look of the show to be aesthetically pleasing to my eye.  Visually, if I like what I see, that keeps me watching.

2) I enjoy Davin Woods music he creates to accompany certain segments of the show. The man knows what he is doing and is very talented at what he does. Think of the music that accompanies the Cinco commercials, the shows intro, or the hilariously mellodramatic music that plays during the ""Damnit"" bit of the ""Hacky Sack Extreme"" skit in Season One.

3) I find that the show brilliantly parodies media. In Paticular, the awkwardness of ""live television"" (Steve Brule, Married News Team). Local afternoon news shows (""The New You""). Ridiculous ""caught on video, candid camera"" style shows (Spagett). And last but not least, the shameless companies that will churn out useless products just so you will plunk down your hard earned dollar on crap you could live without (Cinco product commercials). There is loads of subtext here...and if you don't see it, you may be blind.

4) I love the bizarre way that they mix comedy with elements of horror. (Lazy Horse Mattresses, ""It's Not Jackie Chan"", The Child Clown Safety Video, Maria Bamford's very realistic potrayal of severe mental illness, ""Druwing on Drawing"" etc.)

5) I love the editing style, I am especially a fan of the ""Glitch"" segments.

6) The attention to detail. Any number of segments look like they could have come straight out of 1993, and if taken out of context of the show you would be hard pressed, in some cases, to find evidence proving otherwise.

7) The guys seem like they are genuinely having fun with the show and the universe they have created. They believe in their work, regardless of the many people who just ""Don't get it"" or ""get it but don't like it"". I respect that.

I could go on and on but you get the idea. While YOU may not like it, and that is your perrogative, many people DO...so much so that the show is on it's 4th season and a 5th season has recently been greenlit.

The show will continue to exist and cause many late night couch potatoes, who haven't joined the fold, to scratch their collective head and wonder ""How the hell does anybody find this funny?"". If you have ever found yourself asking that question, try not being so offensive and realize that the buck doesn't stop with you. Humor is subjective.",1236816000,49,2765,4.543259557344064
3652096,1,B001J4E1C4,"I certainly got flamed for my intensely negative review of their season 1 DVD review, but I only spoke the truth as I saw it, which is what a review is.

In my defense, I gave these two a chance.  I was mildly amused by ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" and could even laugh a few times during that show.

I gave this show two chances; season 1 and season 2.

Not once in that entire time did I ever so much as crack a smile, much less laugh.

By my title of ""stroke-inducing"" is in reference actually to one of the newer episodes.  I was watching Adult Swim, and they show a commercial for this show, featuring some kind of sketch about the beginning of the universe, with the fatass Eric going ""BWAAAAAAH"" making stupid explosion sounds while touching his head.  I frowned so hard, I felt a sharp pain in one side of my head, and thought it may have been some kind of blood vessel popping or a stroke-in-the-making.

Nothing these two do is ever funny!  I tried and I tried and I kept watching TWO WHOLE SEASONS but they just simply are not funny.

I can't even put into my own words just WHY they are so terrible, but just say that all their sketches are almost exactly the same; low-energy, nonsensical stupidity with strong emphasis on ""sound humor"" and extreme and awkward closeups of people's faces without makeup, and lots of shoddy green-screen things.  I realize that's obviously their whole ""thing"" in mocking local public access shows and such, but when they do it it's just so damn terrible.

Despite it being in relation to Season 1, the words of this ""[...]"" reviewer are true enough for this season as well:

""Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim are like a tenth year music student that records an entire album on cassette using only a Casio keyboard and their own voice, not because the cassette tape and Casio keyboard somehow validate or complete their artistic vision, but because they're under the false impression that enough irony will somehow cover up their lack of talent. Tim and Eric didn't have the skill to be the next Andy Kaufman or Kids in the Hall, or even Mad TV (how sad is that?), so they choose to hide behind the thin veneer of plausible deniability. If I don't find it funny I must just not get it, right? Wrong, I get it, and it's still just two sub-Tom Green man-children posing as performance artists.

The only saving grace is the small possibility that the real masterminds behind the show have secretly been inspired by David Cronenberg's Videodrome to perform their own brand of retroactive Darwinism. Maybe Tim and Eric Awesome Show actually gives the viewer cancer when viewed in large portions. Maybe decent human beings are expected to be disgusted by the sheer unfunniness of the show and change the channel, thus only those with the worst senses of humour can possibly be infected. It might be less diabolical; perhaps the show just leaves viewers infertile. This is the only explanation for the participation of such admirable celebrities as Maria Bamford, Michael Cera, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Brian Posehn, John C. Reilly, Paul Reubens, Fred Willard, and Jeff Goldblum--they must think they're doing some kind of public service.

Another theory pertaining to the show's continued airing is that Heidecker and Wareheim own large shares of stock in Adult Swim, or perhaps have incriminating photos of Mike Lazzo in their possession. Why else would they even get a second chance after the resounding failure of their first series Tom Goes to Mayor (which was pretty bad, but nowhere near this bad)? Unless, of course, Lazzo and the Adult Swim network is in on the `killing in the name of good taste' plot.

Overall
Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job is that kid in your third grade class that did anything for attention, the one the phrase `ignore it and it will go away' was invented to stop. It's that guy that thinks he's the life of the party when he quotes Dumb and Dumber who wears the same Goonies t-shirt every Tuesday. It's that teenager that buys a guitar and only learns the opening chords of Metallica's most popular songs. This is Dadaism for beginners who don't want to read the textbook or graduate the class. I hate it.""

Those words sum up the entirety of this series exactly the way I feel about them.  Maybe that sudden migraine I got was almost a tumor from their show.",1236643200,8,4332,4.618489583333333
3652097,5,B001J4E1C4,"Intercourse, Pennsylvania (pop. roughly 1,000) is an unincorporated village in Leacock Township, Lancaster County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is ten miles east of Lancaster along PA 340. The village is located within the 17534 ZIP code, 717 area code, and 768 local phone code.

As with the nearby towns of Blue Ball and Paradise, Pennsylvania, Intercourse is a popular site for tourists on account of its location in ""Amish country"". Its name has acquired sexual connotations unrelated to the reasons the village was named. Sign posts for the town are frequently targeted by thieves.

Besides its name, Intercourse is also famous for its Amish communities. For this reason the movie Witness was filmed in Intercourse and For Richer or Poorer was set there, though not filmed in Intercourse.

While it may seem attractive to some to misconstrue ""intercourse"" in its more base sexual form, this has nothing to do with the origins of the village name.

However, later editions of this release should focus more on the technical aspects of the product. After only a few watches, the DVD stopped working when my daughter (who was playing with a big red ball) caused my uke to drop on the player. I called the music shop I bought the uke from and they couldn't help me, so I can only assume fault lies in the hands of the people at Williams Street.

3652102,5,B001J4E1C4,"Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both female and male reproductive organs.

Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later around 30 eggs are laid into a hole in the ground, or under the cover of objects such as fallen logs.

A commonly seen practice among many slugs is apophallation. The penis of these species is curled like a cork-screw and often becomes entangled in their mate's genitalia in the process of exchanging sperm. When all else fails, apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves by one or both of the slugs chewing off the other's penis. Once its penis has been removed, a slug is still able to mate subsequently, but using only the female parts of its reproductive system.",1234396800,6,785,4.850746268656716

If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)

3652104,5,B001J4E1C4,"Muhammad Ali, James Brown, and acting troupe Tim & Eric have acknowledged that their own approach to flamboyant self-promotion was influenced by George. A 19-year old Ali met a 46-year old George at a Las Vegas radio station. During George's radio interview, the wrestler's promo caught the attention of the future heavyweight champion. If George lost to Classy Freddie Blassie, George exclaimed, ""I'll crawl across the ring and cut my hair off! But that's not gonna happen because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world!"" Ali recalled, ""I saw 15,000 people comin' to see this man get beat. And his talking did it. I said, 'This is a gooood idea!'"" In the locker room afterwards, the seasoned wrestler gave the future legend some invaluable advice: ""A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous.""

Tim ""Nighthawk"" Heidecker and Eric ""Eric"" Wareheim were touched by George at the age of four, when they saw his face in the swirled licks of their ice cream cones. Perplexed by the face in their frosted treat, the boys stopped to listen to the sage, otherworldly advice presented by the deceased wrestling great. ""I laugh, because you have no friends. Haa--haa."" The boys did not know what to make of these words until years later when they heard them repeated on Bee Gee's ""Odessa"" album. From that moment on they created the concept of comedy.

3652106,5,B001J4E1C4,"LeFrak City is a large housing development in the southern most region of Corona a neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens, built in the mid-1960s for working and middle-class families and located on the north side of the Long Island Expressway. The complex of twenty eighteen-story (technically sixteen-story, since the lobbies are the 2nd floors and there are no 13th floors) apartment towers covers 40 acres (162,000 m) and currently houses over 14,000 people. The development is part of Queens Community Board

The complex was once home to large Jewish as well as Japanese expatriate communities in the 1960s, while the 1970s saw increased numbers of South Asian, mainly Indian, residents. However, in the 1980s LeFrak City became largely African-American and was known for drugs and gang violence. In 1970, whites were 82% of the complex's population, declining to 25% in 1980 and 9% in 1990, while the black population rose from 8% in 1970 to 67% in 1980 and 79% in 1990. In the 1990s, an influx of Russian immigrants and immigrants from other former Soviet republics (especially Bukharian Jews) and Muslim immigrants from Africa moved in to the development.

The development is also served by playgrounds, tennis courts, a swimming pool, a branch of the Queens Borough Public Library, a post office, two large office buildings, retail space, and over 3,500 parking spaces. The complex is named for its developer, Samuel J. LeFrak.

The LeFrak Organization broke ground in 1960, finishing by 1969, and offered air-conditioned apartments at $40 a room. The LeFrak strategy of ""Total Facilities for Total Living"" meant bringing recreational, shopping, transportation, and other services to the residents.

Accordingly, it is the oldest unchanged soft drink (""soda"" or ""pop"" if you will) in the world. Originally called ""Moxie Nerve Food,"" it contains gentian root extractives, which gives it an odd aftertaste, which many of my friends have likened to motor oil or cough syrup.

Outselling Coca-Cola during the 1920s, it was favored by Calvin Coolidge, baseball legend Ted Williams, and author E.B. White. Moxie seemed to be on top of the world.

However, pressure from rivals such as Coca-Cola eventually forced Moxie into the periphery of the industry. Despite this, it still has a sizable regional following in New England, perhaps owing to the fact that it is the state beverage of Maine. In fact, many creative souls have created mixed alcoholic beverages with Moxie, to somewhat mixed reviews. The parent company of Moxie hopes to stage a comeback by appealing to ""old-school Moxie drinkers"" in Florida and unveiling a nationwide campaign. They are even changing the logo, from the militaristic Moxie man to a swirly thingie. Perhaps this is so young women will not fall madly in love with the nonexistent spokesman for the beverage.

This humble reviewer recommends you try Moxie soon, and if you don't find it enjoyable, try mixing it with whiskey. Moxie is not a Cinco product (yet), and I DO NOT recommend mixing it with sweet berry wine!

The DVD can double as:
Constant Feelings of Inescapable sorrow
Disenfranchisement from peers and social groups
Pretending its all ok
Forgetting to take your medicine
Driving a car off a slick, iced bridge
It looks like an accident
Smoldering metal wreckage
A solitary smile, finally at peace.

3652115,5,B001J4E1C4,"The Brownie Mountain, located in East Gippsland, Australia, is notable for containing large tracts of old growth forest, including over fifty Shining Gum trees estimated to be over 300 years old. The eucalypt forest provides key habitat for rare and threatened species such as the Powerful Owl, the Spotted Quoll, mainland Australia's largest marsupial carnivore, and the Long-footed Potoroo, Victoria's rarest marsupial.

Some parts of Brownie Mountain are already protected within the Errinundra National Park, other sections of forest designated as old growth by the Department of Sustainability and Environment between Legges Road and the Errinundra Road are under the control of VicForests, with logging being allowed.

The logging of the forest has been contentious due to the impact on rare and threatened species, the impact on water supplies, the associated carbon emissions. Environmentalists have called for the unprotected Brownie Mountain forest area to be incorporated into the National Park reserve system planned to link the Errinundra National Park with the Snowy River National Park.

In 2008, logging recommenced in the Brownie Mountain forest, despite Labor Party policy statements during the 2006 Victorian election campaign that they would protect Victoria's last remaining stands of old growth forest available for logging.

Environment Minister Gavin Jennings confirmed that logging Brownie Mountain forest was contentious in his answer to questions in parliament from Greens MP Sue Pennicuik about the logging in progress.

""Is there activity currently being undertaken in East Gippsland that is a source of contention in relation to the appropriateness of it being allocated for harvesting activity and being subject to protest activity?', I can confirm that that is absolutely happening.""

Unfortunately, Tim and Eric ate all of Brownie Mountain.  It was not a dream, but it was awesome.  I watch this DVD, and I hope I never wake up either.",1229040000,8,1968,5.536666666666667
3652116,5,B001J4E1C4,"Shrek the Third is a 2007 animated film, and the third film in the Shrek series, following Shrek and Shrek 2. It was produced by Jeffrey Katzenberg for DreamWorks Animation, and is distributed by Paramount Pictures, and was released in U.S. theaters on May 18, 2007 (exactly 6 years after the first Shrek).

It was produced with the working title of Shrek 3, the name being changed to avoid potential confusion with Shrek 3-D. Like the first two Shrek films, the movie is significantly based on fairy tale themes. The film was rated PG by the MPAA for some crude humor, suggestive content and emotional subjects. It was nominated for Best Animated Movie at the Kids' Choice Awards 2008.

8311949,5,B001J4E1C4,"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job is consistently funny and entertaining, BUT ONLY WHEN IT'S JUST TIM AND ERIC and some of their regular cast members such as Richard Dunn, James Quall and some of the other ""old guys.""  But why, oh why, do they allow some of the episodes to be hijacked by the likes of Zach Galifianakis, Will Forte and other Hollywood types?  I don't get it.  The episodes are already very short to begin with, so why would they waste valuable time on these unfunny, obnoxious ""comedians?  Galifianakis is egregiously out of his element here.  As soon as he appears, all the momentum, humor and energy is immediately sucked out of the episode and it comes to a grinding halt.  It's just painful to watch this guy -- he is so full of himself and, what's worse, he actually believes that he is funny.  The other dead weight on the show is David Liebe Hart.  His performances are cringe-worthy.  Guys, do everyone a favor:  just keep it to Tim and Eric, please, and get rid of all the SNL and SNL-affiliated losers.  They have no place on your show.",1435276800,,1066,4.471502590673575
