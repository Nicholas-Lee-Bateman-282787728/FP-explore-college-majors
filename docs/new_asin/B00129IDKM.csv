8244867,4,B00129IDKM,"In BECAUSE OF HIM (1946), a delightful backstage comedy, Deanna Durbin was joined by two of her most popular male co-stars: Charles Laughton (""It Started with Eve""), and Franchot Tone (""Nice Girl?"", ""His Butler's Sister"").

Based on a story entitled ""Catherine the Last"" by Edmund Beloin and Sig Herzig, Deanna plays Kim Walker, a young waitress in New York who wishes to become a serious stage actress. She uses an autograph belonging to esteemed Broadway actor John Sheridan (Charles Laughton) in order to land an audition for his upcoming play, ""Strange Laughter"", written by Mr Paul Taylor (Franchot Tone). Both men soon discover Kim's deception and she's politely told to give up. But Kim's roommate Nora (Helen Broderick) cheekily contacts all the newspapers with the story that Kim has attempted suicide because she cannot secure the lead in Sheridan's play! Hilarious comic hijinks ensue...

BECAUSE OF HIM was a rare change of pace for Deanna Durbin. She really only gets to sing two full-length songs in the whole movie (""Danny Boy"" and ""Goodbye""); plus a clever duet with her own recording of ""Lover"". In the film, the character of Kim wants to be recognised for her acting talents and not her singing, so the filmmakers toned down Durbin's usual musical antics in favour of screwball comedy and sweet romance. What emerges is one of Deanna's all-time best from the period. She's beautifully costumed by Travis Banton (Marlene Dietrich's costumier of choice for all the 1930s' classics with Josef von Sternberg).

BECAUSE OF HIM will be an essential title for any classic movie or Deanna Durbin collection!",1241913600,2,1617,5.071428571428571
