8198059,5,B000QXDGES,I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew's birthday. Whenever he gets a gift he always destroys them. Well.... I am happy to say this is one gift that he LOVES and he watches it a few days every week since May 2015. He absolutely loves seals!,1449100800,,238,3.9791666666666665
8198060,4,B000QXDGES,"I'd never watched this 2007 program before, but it was clearly a painstaking effort to document everything about a remarkable creature, the Northern elephant seal. Dr. Sylvia Earle, sounding like the science teacher you always wish you had, does the narration. The videography is simply beautiful, and there are facts of interest for everyone: I'd read about the species but never knew how it had survived almost certain extinction. A tour of a kelp forest is one of the interesting byways taken in following the seal's migration.

8198061,5,B000QXDGES,"A Seal's Life- Things you never knew! Who knew about the extraordinary travels of seals? As land-locked beings, we only really see them on shore lounging about. Watch this flick to learn what it takes to be a seal! Their time spent resting on rocks on land near shore is very well-deserved!",1294963200,,290,4.596153846153846
8198062,5,B000QXDGES,"The images, story and music in this film takes you into the seals' world wonderfully!  It has a very good balance of scenery and information.  The cinimatography is absolutely gorgeous!
The viewpoint of the director made it an intimate experience that will engage children and adults alike.",1186012800,6,290,5.148936170212766
