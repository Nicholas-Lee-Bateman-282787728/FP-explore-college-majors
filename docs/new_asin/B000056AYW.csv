7931684,5,B000056AYW,This is a truly hysterical show. I only wish they would release it on DVD (region 1). My fingers are crossed.,1210550400,,109,4.238095238095238
7931685,4,B000056AYW,"Whitbury Leisure Centre falls victim to more Brittas mayhem in another selection of hilarious episodes. The crazy mix of staff introduced and developed in the first series are now required to deal with some of the every day realities inherent in running the centre - as well as dealing with some more unlikely events, and the even more unlikely effects of Brittas himself.
""Back From The Dead"" capitalises on the Brittas effect, with bookings skyrocketing after he is reported to have been killed. Unfortunately his return results in much confusion as Colin and Carol mistake him for a ghost trying to possess her baby.
""Temple of the Body"" sees confusion arise as Brittas tries to catch his staff misusing the centre after-hours.
""An Inspector Calls"" sees more chaos after a pigeon gets loose during the inspector's visit.
""Set In Concrete"" has a specialist trying to determine just what is causing all the sicknesses in the centre, though that was pretty obvious to the masons who concreted Brittas' feet.
""Mums and Dads"" has the staff trying to keep a pianist's fingers safe from accidents until his recital - not the easiest task in this centre!
""Safety First"" involves the staff in an effort to improve safety at the centre, and the usual unlikely string of coincidences results in the local councillor finding out just why it is needed!
The episodes included here are hilarious, though again there are only 2 episodes on each of the 3 tapes. The collection is also missing the final episode of the second series, where both Carole and a cow give birth in the centre.",1011571200,3,1572,4.847583643122676
7931686,5,B000056AYW,"""Red Dwarf"" star Chris Barrie is Gordon Brittas, the manager of a leisure center, in this riotously funny British comedy.  Brittas is the very incarnation of the ""nanny state.""  He is essentially decent and well-meaning, but he understands nothing about people.  Thus, with the very best of intentions, he creates chaos and catastrophe all around him by bullying the staff and patrons with absurd bureauctatic dictates.  The leisure center becomes like ""1984"" as ruled by a clownish Big Brother.  Luckily the pretty, common-sensical, competent assistant manager (Julia St. John) keeps things from going completely to hell.  Brittas also has a wife (energetically played by the marvelous Pippa Haywood) who pops pills out of the stress of being married to this saintly monster.  She also has a (ahem) colorful past and is slowly going mad from sexual deprivation.  The staff is a collection of bizarre characters who all push Brittas to spasms of rage (as only Barrie can play).  A terrific series that deserves a wider following.",987638400,7,1029,5.150602409638554
7931687,5,B000056AYW,"Britta's is one of the lesser known British Comedies but what it lacks in fame, it surely makes up in hilarious content.  Chris Barrie (of Red Dwarf fame) leads this cast of misfits.  You can't believe the trouble they get into as they try to direct this fitness center.  Definitely one of the best BBC comedies in years.",983577600,5,321,4.5
