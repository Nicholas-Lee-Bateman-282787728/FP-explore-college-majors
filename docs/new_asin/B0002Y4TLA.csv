2140414,1,B0002Y4TLA,"Warner Brothers have reissued The Searchers in 2004, the transfer being stated as 1:1.85 aspect ratio.  In this package they are disposing of their old 1997 copies - this has a double sided disc, with a cropped 4:3 version on one side, and, even worse, on the flip side a widescreen version where the vertical image has been significantly cropped (the tops of actors' heads are often lopped off, and the magnificent landscapes are similarly ridiculously framed - to see what you are missing, just flip over to the 4:3 version: the heads and mesas and buttes are seen in full, but of course the horizontal image is severely cropped) - the stated aspect ratio is 1.75:1.

Similarly they reissued Stagecoach in 2004, but this is the 1997 version.  The Cowboys dates from 1998, and Rio Bravo's transfer is from 2001.

I purchased this set primarily for The Searchers and to now find such an inferior transfer is very frustrating.  I would suggest potential buyers take care with other Warner Bros. compilations as they too might be deceptive means of dispensing of obsolete DVD transfers.",1118448000,180,1084,4.837837837837838
2140415,5,B0002Y4TLA,"Most of the John Wayne movies prior to ""Stagecoach"" were just generic shoot-'em-ups but in this movie, he made a name for himself as a man's man. It lasted for another 40 years. The disparate flawed characters and competent character actors who portrayed them made ""Stagecoach"" a unique film, an ""adult Western"" years before ""High Noon"" which has been called the ""first"" such movie.  ""The Searchers"" shows the intensity and acting ability of Wayne for which he was never given credit as he searches for years for a niece kidnapped by renegade Indians.  This is a classic Western also with accomplished character actors, great direction by John Ford and beautiful locales meant to be Texas but filmed in Arizona's Monument Valley in color.  ""Rio Bravo"" was the original and the best of other like-themed movies of Wayne's about the good guys being under siege by a host of bad guys.  Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan lend good support, along with the much younger Wayne love interest, Angie Dickinson. The theme was repeated in ""El Dorado"" and ""Rio Lobo"", not to mention the two modern-day versions of ""Assault on Precinct 13"".  For ""The Cowboys"", the producers did not use Wayne's usual retinue of friends and family as supporting characters but instead showed him as a lone rancher, having to use kids to drive his cattle to market.  It was not as well-received as the other movies herein as Wayne did not prevail in the usual manner, but veteran bad guy Bruce Dern is memorable and at his slimy backshootingest best.  This is a good cross-section of the Duke's career, as stated, and I recommend it.  Just don't forget to get ""True Grit"" and ""The Shootist"" (a term first used by real life bad guy Ben Thompson).",1106524800,20,1725,4.784511784511785
2140416,5,B0002Y4TLA,"For anyone who is interested, I thought I'd let it be known that this isn't JUST ""The Searchers"" (1956) but an actual DVD collection (""signature edition"") of John Wayne's films, to be released on October 12th. It will include a bundle of his most famous and cherished a la The Scorsese Collection and Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection.

So, don't be scared by the $36 price -- it's going to be more than just The Searchers. I hope Amazon fixes this soon and posts all the other films to be included.",1093996800,8,503,4.588888888888889

2140458,1,B0002Y4TLA,"Unlike most other reviewers using the opportunity to tell you how great these films are (of course they are), this is a review of the PRODUCT not the original films (surely the point). Basically if you're looking for a watchable STAGECOACH go elsewhere - the version contained here is the worst  imaginable - worst print I've ever seen on a DVD. The rest are passable but the Stagecoach is literally unwatchable. Caveat Emptor.",1354060800,18,427,4.8493150684931505
2140459,5,B0002Y4TLA,I am a real John Wayne fan from way back. This is a good collection. Somehow in all the years past this is the first time i ever saw the movie Stage Coach. I have tons of the old black and white John Wayne movies that were considered B movies. Personally i rate almost all of his movies as excelent.,1325116800,,299,4.0

2140461,5,B0002Y4TLA,"The year 1939 was a golden year at the box office. Movies like Gone With The Wind, The Wizard Of Oz, and of course Stagecoach were released. With Stagecoach John Wayne introduced the world to the charactor he was destined to play, the western mega star, John Wayne. If You love westerns, they don't come bigger than The Duke. He conveyed to us the slight comedy and the HARD BARK, which is sampled in these four great fims. A great collection at a terrific price.",1275004800,,463,4.458823529411765

2140463,1,B0002Y4TLA,"John Wayne, one of the most politically incorrect actors all time(probably the most politically incorrect), was teamed many times with  a racist and very politically incorrect director ""John Ford"" and a very commercial and politically incorrect director ""Howard Hawks"".

John Ford described the native brutally,falsely and the white innocent in his technically famous films ""The Searchers"", ""Stagecoach"", and he twisted the story of the great novel ""The grapes of wrath"" by the view point of the ruler. Is he a good director? Yes, he is a technially good director, but he informed the audience of wrong history done by most whites. The native were killed in their land by the white, and the white took the native's property. So ""The Searchers"", ""Stagecoach"" can not be good any sense for the society even though those movies were technically great.

John Wayne was worse than John Ford(they were almost the same). In 1950's which-hunt, some Hollywood liberals made the film ""High Noon"" to attack the extreme right wing. After watching the film ""High Noon"", John Wayne and Howard Hawks decided to attack the Hollywood liberals, so they made the film ""Rio Bravo"". The result was a politically incorrect film(a very falsely informed and extremely right wing propaganda film).

Did we need a extremely right wing propaganda fim in 1950's?

Some people say a film should be decided by itself (technical standards  only). I don't agree with that opinion because a film influence the audience. That's why only Jim Morrison(lead singer of ""doors"") liked Marlon Brando, the other UCLA class mates liked the racist, extremist John  Wayne. I hope to watch technically good films with human conscience.",1168300800,2,1690,5.145985401459854

8034494,5,B0002Y4TLA,"Bought this collection mainly for Stagecoach, which is my absolute favorite classic with John Wayne. The Cowboys is another excellent movie if you are the least bit interested in Westerns. Rio Bravo and the Searchers are not the Duke's best, (the comedic relief is corny) but are still passable for true fans. These four are all great examples of the ""good guys"" triumphing over evil.",1500768000,,384,4.923076923076923

They said it was in good condition, but the outside box was in terrible condition and a couple of the dvd's had pretty bad scratches on them and skip now and then when playing the movie.
