3850023,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Just completed watching this new release of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre! And happy to say that all the shows where very enjoyable! The other two reviewers pretty much cover this set so I can't add much to what they've already stated! Expect to say, that I liked the fact that every episode has a new star or stars so ""every week"" the show was completly new. And I like the introduction by Dick Powell at the beginning of every episode; it added a nice touch and gives some back ground info on western history beofre the show starts!

Lastly, the DVD's transfers and restoration process is very good for film from the fifties! Bring on season two!!

PS> Its the whole season one! Not season 1, vol. #1 followed by vol 2 and 3 as some businessmen have packaged other products trying to squeeze every buck out of the buying public!",1245628800,69,832,4.467105263157895
3850024,5,B0025Y3SZS,"In the early days of television way back when in the 1950's
and 1960's the most successful shows, were not cop or sci-fi shows,
it was the almighty western. Of course by today's viewers standards
they are all but gone, no where to be found.

So is it any wonder that our friendly VCI Entertainment has looked into
their crystal ball and come up with another gem releasing ""Dick Powell's
Zane Grey Theater: Season One"". Master storyteller and author Zane Grey
was one of the famous writers of western novels for the longest time.
That being the case, the books of Zane Grey were an obvious choice for a
great satire of wonderful stories from the early days in America.

Powell served as a sort of western Rod Serling hosting the show
which featured a new western adventure each week. At times would also
star in the episodes. The show at first only did Zane Grey stories but
eventually did other stories as well.

Zane Grey Theater was created by Luke Short and Charles A. Wallace. The
series was originally based on the short stories and novels of Western
author Zane Grey, but as the episodes continued, new material was
included. Aaron Spelling, who later became a legend in Hollywood, wrote
twenty Zane Grey episodes. The program opened with a prelude of the
episode followed by the introduction, the firing of a gun, with the
proclamation: ""From out of the West, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater"".

3850025,5,B0025Y3SZS,"I remember seeing this show in syndication years ago as a child and teenager, and I had no idea Mr. Powell had had such a diverse career. Starting out as a crooner in Busby Berkeley musicals in the 1930's, evolving into a star in film noir, and then transitioning to television in a number of shows including this one from the golden age of TV westerns in the 1950's. He was in good company with other stars such as Robert Montgomery, who hosted his own first-rate TV show in the 1950's.

This show is not really a series. Instead it was in the mold of the weekly playhouse kind of show that was so popular in the 1950's. Each episode stood alone and featured different stars each week, some being quite popular figures from the silver screen. The show first used material from Zane Grey, but as time passed material had to come from elsewhere as well.  The following is a listing of the episodes of that first season as well as the stars that were featured.

1.01 - You Only Run Once  - Robert Ryan, Cloris Leachman
1.02 - Fearful Courage  - James Whitmore, Ida Lupino
1.03 - The Long Road Home  - Mr. Powell, Ray Collins
1.04 - The Unrelenting Sky  - Lew Ayres, Phyllis Avery
1.05 - The Lariat  - Jack Palance, Constance Ford
1.06 - Death Watch  - Lee J. Cobb, Bobby Driscoll
1.07 - Stage for Tucson  - Eddie Albert, Mona Freeman
1.08 - Quiet Sunday in San Ardo - Wendell Corey, Gerald Mohr
1.09 - Vengeance Canyon  - Walter Brennan, Ben Cooper
1.10 - Return to Nowhere  - John Ireland, Steven McNally
1.11 - Courage is a Gun  - Mr. Powell, Beverly Garland

1.28 - Badge of Honor  - Gary Merrill, Tom Tully, Robert Culp
1.29 - Decision at Wilson's Creek - John Forsythe, John Dehner
1.30 - Man on the Run  - Scott Brady, Nancy Hale

Each episode is 30 minutes in length and features such diverse talent as James Garner at the beginning of his career and Chester Morris near the end of his career. Mr. Powell stars in three of the thirty episodes. VCI, though not widely known, has taken part in some quality restorations before, so I am hoping these great western dramas will be carefully restored.",1240099200,104,2990,4.403284671532846
3850026,5,B0025Y3SZS,"I had never heard of ""Zane Grey Theatre"" until I recently discovered the show on ""GRIT"" TV.  This series is fantastic.  As I watch the episodes, I discover actors who would go on to make it big in other shows.  The series seems to have transferred to DVD very well.  The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that it automatically goes to the next show (e.g., after episode 1 ends, episode 2 automatically starts).  This is a very small complaint, and the ""menu"" button resolves that issue.  Overall, I love this nostalgic western anthology series.",1447718400,,551,4.571428571428571

3850029,4,B0025Y3SZS,"This black and white western anthology series ran from 1956 to 1961. It was hosted by Dick Powell who also appeared in some episodes. It was produced by Four Star which was originally intended to be Dick Powell, Charles Boyer, Joel McCrea and Rosalind Russell. The latter two pulled out and were replaced by David Niven and later by Ida Lupino. But it was Dick Powell who was the real force behind this production company as he seemed to be involved hands on while the others took a back seat. Although David Niven and Ida Lupino would appear in a few episodes.
Dick Powell was a famous crooner from the 1930's and made a lot of hollywood musicals. When his popularity began to decline he reinvented himself in the mid 1940's and went into film noir movies like ""Cornered"" and ""Murder, My Sweet"" as Philip Marlowe. Later he would reinvent himself again by starting his production company Four Star and producing shows for TV in the 1950's.
There were many big name guest stars established or up and coming that appeared in ""Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre"", like
Robert Ryan,Jack Palance,Walter Brennan, James Drury, Eddie Albert,Robert Vaughn to name a few.
The episodes range from good to not bad to was that it. This show would produce pilots for other TV shows like ""The Rifleman"", ""The Westerner"", ""Black Saddle"", ""Johnny Ringo"" and ""Trackdown"".
The picture quality is good but due to syndication some of Dick Powell's introductions are cut because of Sponsor ads. Also in Season 2 the pilot for ""The Rifleman"" is not included due to legal reasons. But if you really wanted this episode you will find it on the DVD release of ""The Rifleman"" season one which is on release.
Bonus Features on Season One are an interview with Norman Powell,Dick's son. An audio interview with author Christine Becker. Trailers and commercials for Maxwell House. I am sure that the man on the boat in one of the commercials is Eric Fleming who would later play Gil Favor on ""Rawhide"". But I am not positive.
Bonus features on Season Two are an interview with Zane Grey's Son Loren Grey and a 1933 movie called  ""Man of the Forest with Randolph Scott.
Bonus feature on season three is a 1931 movie called ""Fighting Caravans"" with Gary Cooper.
Below is a taster of some of the more interesting episodes over the three seasons. But there are much more.

Season One
COURAGE IS A GUN with Dick Powell and Robert Vaughn
A gunslinger is wounded by a marshal and vows revenge.

BLACK CREEK ENCOUNTER with Ernest Borgnine.
A man who has laid down his guns is now challenged by a man whose father he killed. If he refuses he would shame himself in front of his young son.

Season two

A man promises his wife he will never use a gun. But then his son is killed.

A GUN FOR MY BRIDE with Eddie Albert.
A woman elopes with a ranch hand to later find out he is a fugitive from justice.

If she were alive today I am sure she would be playing super heroes like in ""Marvel's Agents of Shield"" or something like it.

3850034,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Zane Grey Theatre was a mainstay of German TV in the late 1950's. Many Germans loved American Westerns and there were plenty around at the time, Gunsmoke (TV Series 19551975), Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV Series 19581961), Have Gun - Will Travel (TV Series 19571963), Branded (TV Series 19651966), The Rifleman (TV Series 19581963), Rawhide (TV Series 19591965), Laramie (TV Series 19591963), Wagon Train (195762 and 196265), and Lawman (TV Series 19581962).

Just watching Zane Grey Theatre, you are reminded how good shows were written, how well they were acted and the sets, even though at times cheap, how they ultimately provided a more than reliable Western feel.

Frequent stars and character actors provided good action and fluid movement in the time allotted. Seeing them now, I am reminded how much I miss 1950's television.

Claude Akins, Eddie Albert, Martin Balsam, James Garner, Ernest Borgnine, David Janssen, Jack Elam, Burt Reynolds, Sterling Hayden, Cameron Mitchell, Jack Palance are just a few of the great actors that were on the show.

Of course, no one today will remember all these fine actors, which is a complete shame.",1436227200,,1142,5.123655913978495

3850064,4,B0025Y3SZS,"Dick Powell hosts and now and then stars in this digitally remastered half-hour TV anthology series from the 1950s. A host of actors - some past their fame but more just becoming household names - are starred in the western tales. Of course these films were shot prior to the color craze of the mid-60s, so all have the advantage of that brilliant black and white lighting and photography. Since this series was prior to ""Gunsmoke,"" billed as the first adult western, today's viewers will take issue with that boast after viewing these offerings. Virtually all offer a bit more angst than found in the usual western fare back in that era. If you like westerns and a chance to see the beginnings for some acting careers that skyrocketed before they ended on this plain and resumed on that silver screen in the sky, then grab a copy of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.",1357689600,3,866,4.62987012987013

3850073,4,B0025Y3SZS,"I thought I'd add my 2 cent review to the mix.  It was difficult for me to decide on a number for this show.  For the money, three seasons and 94 episodes of ""Wanted:Dead or Alive"" is a much better deal to this one season and the shows are every bit as good.  For a while they were trying to sell this at $30 or more and I didn't bite and glad I didn't.  Now that it's down around $20, I'd say it's worth the $$ if you're a fan of these old western shows.  They're 1/2 hour, good for people who have a tendency to fall asleep halfway through a movie.  It's difficult to do a lot of plot and character development in that time, but a good story can be told and usually is.

There are some typical western type shows, my favorite being ""Courage is a Gun"", Episode 11 which includes the man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Robert Vaughn, as well as Claude Akins, Dick Powell and Beverly Garland.  A great twist to the classic shootout.  But this show is really about Dick Powell and all his acting buddies, so much more often it's more of a story that just happens to be set in the old west.  The following episode, 12, ""Muletown Gold Strike"" has Rory Calhoun as a school teacher helping a little boy find his dad's gold mine and I don't remember a single shot being fired after the killing of a rat (literal) about 2 minutes into the show.  The big plus to the show were all the people that Mr. Powell was able to attract to do episodes.  The big minus is that sometimes they're a little hard to swallow.  Perhaps you've witnessed the transformation of Jack Lemmon from dude to Cowboy in the movie of that name.  Well by episode 14 of this show, he's become a gunfighter, something I'd never imagined of Mr. Lemmon.  Also 50 something Mr. Powell is a sheriff who can shoot the gun out of the hand of the best gunfighter around.  Some stuff that's pretty hard to swallow today, but was very common back then.  And then there's Ralph Bellamy defending a wife who's about 30 years younger and winning her heart over a young handsome James Garner.

There are special features on the last disc.  An interview with Dick Powell's son, another with a women who's researched Dick Powell's Four Star Productions, and some vintage commercials.  Neither is a big deal, but it's always nice to have something.  Also I'd add that I was content with the overall quality of the restoration.  There's a disclaimer run on each disc that basically says ""we did the best that we could with what we had"" - and I believe them and I'm satisfied.

Overall I'd say this show is more like ""Wagon Train"" than ""Gunsmoke"".  Every week a completely new character to watch.  As much as a couple of shows wanted to make me gag, I'd say overall I very much enjoyed them, my favorite two probably being episodes 11 and 12 that I've already mentioned (and this is the 50 somethingish old sheriff who shoots, but that ain't the end of the that story).  I'd say 29 episodes (the reviewer who listed 30 has a duplication on the Robert Ryan, Cloris Leachman a.k.a.) if they can be picked up for $20ish is something I'd be willing to do again after having watched them.",1326499200,3,3113,4.361111111111111
3850074,3,B0025Y3SZS,"I saw some of these shows in my childhood but they just aren't what I remembered. As as child I thought they were exciting but seeing them again I realise that they were terribly contrived. There is a certain naive charm about some of the stories and it is sort of interesting to see some actors before they were really famous. Other than that meh! I think nostalgia got the better of me,",1313366400,,388,4.328767123287672

3850076,2,B0025Y3SZS,"For fans of the Golden Age of westerns, this series has it all: interesting story lines, famous actors before they became famous, and an affable host.

And it's all ruined by the poor sound quality. As O. Pringle said in his/her review, the sound level is not consistent. You've got to turn the volume way up sometimes to hear the dialog, then a second later turn it down because of the blaring music.

And to make matters worse, the audio is often muddled. Sometimes you cannot make out what is being said (at any volume setting).

I bought this as a gift for an older relative who has pretty good hearing. She mentioned the audio problem to me, and after watching several episodes I had to agree with her. It's a real shame that the audio could not be improved somehow.",1305158400,15,771,4.453900709219858
3850077,5,B0025Y3SZS,I was born in 1952 and have a slight memory of Dick Powell hosting a TV show but cannot remember any of these programs.  Watching the Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre series is all new to me. I received my set on Friday and have watched 2 of the 4 DVD's of Zane Grey Theatre Complete Season One. I have really enjoyed viewing this series and will hate when I have seen the last episode. I WANT MORE!  The writing and acting is outstanding.  I have a new respect for character actors.  The series is QUALITY and the acting is EXCELLENT.  I do not watch any new drama or comedy series that are currently on televison.  The programs just do not compare to the old ones (50's and 60's).  I want the other seasons made  available for purchase soon!,1295740800,7,742,4.287769784172662
3850078,4,B0025Y3SZS,"The video quality is mostly excellent. Stripes in Powell's coat make an odd shimmer on my LCD TV set. But the sound level has extreme variations. At places the highest level possible on my TV is still not enough, at others I must sharply reduce the volume level. I do not know if this is the original sound level or if the production of this set is somehow involved. Today's technology should enable improvement of this problem. I considered giving it just 3 stars. No doubt many viewers of this series will be older people who may have some hearing impairment.",1292630400,6,561,4.564356435643564
3850079,5,B0025Y3SZS,"There are many western movies and former TV series on the market (and I have purchased many of them), but I was almost estatic when I was able to located and purchase an entire season of Zane Grey Theatre, one of my most cherished childhood ('50s) TV series.  Wow, what memories!!!  I was very surprised by the quality of the audio/video.  The sound and picture quality were just as clear and crisp today as it was over 50 yrs. ago.  I have proudly shared my find with my brother and several childhood buddies.  The audio intro, ""From out of the West""!!! brings back pleasant memories of those innocent teenage years.

3850092,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, is one of those wonderful old western series that has remained neglected for far too long, the always appealing ex crooner,  Dick Powell introduces the 30 minute stories, and even stars in an occasional one! Famouse guest stars are plentiful, and 'soon to be' stars that were on the way up, are fun to spot as well. Picture quality on this set is excellent, and I for one can only hope further seasons of this entertaining old series are forthcoming!  How great to re issue these wonderful kinds of shows from back in the era when television really WAS entertaining!",1279756800,3,599,4.695238095238095
3850093,5,B0025Y3SZS,"This is not so much a review as it is a request . DICK POWELL'S ZANE GREY THEATRE was not just a great series...it also produced several pilot episodes for subsequent T.V. series produced by his production company,FOUR STAR PRODUCTIONS.One such pilot was included in this first season, ""BADGE OF HONOR"".
This episode served as the pilot for the powerful CBS western series, TRACKDOWN...which starred the late great ROBERT CULP.
This  series lasted 70 episodes in the late 50's, and actually served as the pilot for the successful STEVE McQUEEN series, ""WANTED:DEAD OR ALIVE"".
But, unlike that,and many other FOUR STAR series,that have been released on DVD,including THE RIFLEMAN, BURKES LAW, HONEY WEST, and others, Robert Culp's TRACKDOWN has not,although several episodes were shown on TV LAND in the early 2000's

In the light of Mr Culp's recent passing , please consider this a request to put TRACKDOWN  on DVD, as well as another successful FOUR STAR  T.V. series, THE DETECTIVES Starring ROBERT TAYLOR.
BOTH series are long overdue for DVD release.",1272153600,9,1055,5.116279069767442
3850094,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Best tv western anthology series ever. Great stories, great stars, great fun. I recommend this series very highly and am eagerly awaiting the release of Season Two.",1252713600,2,164,5.111111111111111
3850095,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Dick Powell made quite a career for himself in television after a long and remarkable career in motion pictures. His business mind and friendly personality made him an excellent producer-director, and he worked with some of the best talents of the era. This is the first complete season of his Zane Grey theatre, a series he felt strongly about. It incorporates his love for anthologies and his appreciation for author Zane Grey.

There are many stories presented, too many to get into, but the series does an excellent job of capturing the old west and the values of an era gone by. Guests included Powell himself, Cloris Leachman, Ida Lupino, Jack Lemmon, Wendell Corey, Carolyn Jones, David Niven, Ernest Borgnine, Beulah Bondi, and many others.

Thankfully, VCI has gone through pains not only to restore the image quality of the series, but also to find the most complete openers to each episode. Powell introduced each episode with short stories or lessons about the old west, and many were cut during re-runs to omit mention of previous sponsors. In some cases, the originals were unable to be found, but in many, the complete introduction is presented. On top of that, we get to feast on vintage commercials and an excellent interview with Dick's son Norman Powell. The interviewer cuts Norman off a few times and occasionally abruptly changes the subject, but Norman seems a willing and knowledgable interviewee.

If you are a fan of Zane Grey, classic television, or Dick Powell, you will love this set.",1252022400,11,1513,4.925490196078432
3850096,4,B0025Y3SZS,"I just finished the first season. The major assets are the great actors that Powell was able to get. The shows were generally quite well produced, too. Some of the stories were great, like Badge of honor and Courage is a gun (with Powell himself). The last two were quiet poor, however. The last one was done totally from the point of South and concerned about a Southern spy during the civil war. Here in Europe the Southerners are the bad guys supporting slaverty, so this dedication to this cause was difficult to take. Also, the indians were treated badly in the series. Even Powell made some bad jokes about indians in his introduction. I always hope that the white men will lose in the fights, but not in this show.

But perhaps I am too harsh. It is impossiple to have high level stories every week. It was really nice to see Jack Lemmon, David Niven, Ida Lupino, Rory Calhoun, Lloyd Bridges and many others. I am sure I will buy the next season, too.",1251244800,5,958,4.443181818181818

But most of the episodes are freshly written and directed by great creative hollywood minds of the 1950's. My video is meant to give you a taste for how the series looks and feels and show the titles of the various episodes. The suave humorous Dick Powell introduces each episode in person with a backdrop that allows him to demonstrate a key point about the upcoming drama. For example, in the opener called ""You Only Run Once""  ( I love that title..) Powell holds an old wooden ballot box and talks about some of the methods by which votes were taken in the pioneering days of the west. The story itself is about a man accused of being an accomplice to murder and his life literally ""hangs"" in the balance based on a vote from a gathered lynch mob. It is remarkable how the stories in this series hold up excellently by today's standards.  For example, in ""Fearful Courage"" a woman's husband is murdered by his boss over a dispute about payment for work, and a hired killer is sent out to make sure his wife is dead too.  Nasty stuff. The show is not timid at all about the adult nature of the subject matter it presents. The woman gets advance notice from a neighbor that the killer is coming and she makes a desperate run for it. The killer spots her trying to flee and chases her down, but she manages to take cover in a small cabin in the woods where she intrudes upon a young James Whitmore ( won an emmy for his appearnce in ""The Practice"" ), who ultimately decides to try to help her as the killer holds them pinned down. The episodes are serious, tense, drama that does an excellent job of telling a complete story in under 30 minutes. Each story is different, each one unique. The only thread that links all the stories in the series is Dick Powell's opening introduction to each one. The episodes could each stand alone as great pieces of entertainment. Some of Hollywood's most famous stars of the past show up in the series. People you are probably familiar with. Jack Palance, Eddie Albert, DeForest Kelly ( yes..., the actor who played Dr. McCoy from Star Trek...), James Garner, Jack Lemmon, Ernest Borgnine, Lloyd Bridges, and a lot of others. It's amazing how many rising stars performed in this series. The disks themselves worked perfectly and came in a compact, easy to store case with four DVD's. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves great acting and great drama and would like to see the early work of some of the hollywood's legendary actors.

3850100,5,B0025Y3SZS,"Matt Dillon, Doc, Chester, Kitty, 30 minute western TV doesn't get much better than early episodes of Gunsmoke.  Except Zane Grey theater actually does.  A different star is in the lead role every show, and the list for western fans is mind boggling; Jack Palance, Robert Ryan, Walter Brennan, Robert Vaughn, Lloyd Bridges, Sterling Hayden, Claude Akins, the list goes on and on.  Many of these stars also appeared in Gunsmoke episodes (and numerous other TV westerns), but in Zane Grey theater they act in an unmistakable lead role.  These 31 episodes are gritty TV adult westerns.  Gunfighters, gamblers, femme fatales, men with a conscience, men without a conscience, it's all here with great writing and direction.  Cool introductions to each episode by Dick Powell, fantastic packaging, liner notes, picture and sound. Buy it, support it, and lets hope they release seasons 2 thru 5 soon.
