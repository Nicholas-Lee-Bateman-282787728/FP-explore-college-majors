2125564,5,B0002VEV9S,"Pardes means Foreign Land. This film was released in 1997. Shah Rukh Khan plays the role of Arjun Saagar. A wealthy Indian man (Amrish Puri) raises his son (Apoorva Agnihotri) in America, but wants his son to marry a native girl from India. He arranges a marriage for his son. He sends his foster son (Shah Rukh Khan) to India to make arrangements for the marriage. Arjun (Shah Rukh Khan) speaks favorably of his ""brother"" (Apoorva Agnihotri). However Apoorva Agnihotri's character is not good. The young Indian girl (Mahima Chaudhary) comes to America and finds it difficult to adjust to the ""Foreign Land"". A very beautiful song called ""I Love My India"" is in this film. This is a wonderful film!",1335312000,12,698,4.776859504132231

This is a different film from the others as it concentrates on the differences between countries. The songs in the film are also meaningful and romantic.

2125591,5,B0002VEV9S,"A wonderful movie with great stars. I'd already seen this movie a couple of times when I saw it for sale on Amazon and knew I wanted to have it for my personal library. This is an entertaining, but very moving & inspirational movie about the cultural differences that can come between NRI's (non-resident Indians) and those raised in India with Indian values. The values portrayed are an important reason that I choose to watch Indian movies so watching the struggle that can be overwhelming to a young couple is very emotional. This has great songs, beautiful settings, wonderful costumes and laughs along with the tears. Of course, I can't imagine too many people who aren't eager to watch any movie with ShahRukh Khan and this one is no exception. If you haven't seen it, I suggest watching it ASAP - you just might find a new favorite.",1450483200,,839,4.675675675675675

2125622,5,B0002VEV9S,"Mahima Chaudhary is outstanding in this debut film that shows her strong acting abilities. Shah Rukh Khan as always, is great in his role.  He must have enjoyed swinging through the air from the height of a very tall crane during the song ""Yeh Dil"", memorable at the time of its release.  The story is about Indians now living in the USA, who have done well in their new country, who want nothing to do with the old country, as shown in their treatment of Ganga, who has lived in India all her life, but has now been selected to marry the snobbish son of a ""non-returning Indian"" millionaire, and her father's friend.  The film centers on the need for good Indian girls from the mother country, who the father-in-law says, are neede for the Indian men living abroad, who have become successful business men, versed in Western culture and ways, who have forgotten their heritage. It shows their resentment of Ganga, and their negative attitude towards their native land as being backwards!  It is an excellent film with some great songs one, ""I love my India"", was to celebrate India's 50 years of Independence.",1435190400,,1110,4.676923076923077

There is a huge dose of overacting - to the point it is reminiscent of the New Years blockbusters from Hong Kong. I'm not sure if it is intentional or not, but for me it definitely falls in to the so bad it's good category. The end of the movie is very violent in comparison to the rest of the movie.

2125664,2,B0002VEV9S,"Gee, we Americans are really awful people in this movie!  Always standing about sneering at Indians, except when we're not busy smoking, drinking or carousing.  And we seem to seem to have no sense of proportion, such as the part where the female lead's multi-multi-millionaire American fiance completely blows up at her because she accidentally used the newspaper clipping of their engagement announcement to wrap food in - and that was his ONLY COPY of the newspaper clipping - the ONLY ONE !!!  We Americans really treasure our newspaper clippings.  They are rare and irreplaceable.

As far as acting goes, I liked Sharukh and both fathers, all of whom I've seen in many movies before.  I also liked both grandmothers, and the the girl was okay and her mother.  Everyone else was so very very bad.  All the Americans were terrible, but it may be because they had them saying such weird rude things.

Bollywood movies often are bad but I still love them.  I don't know what it is about me and Bollywood.  I think I like the emotion and their often confusing but strong family ties.  I forgive all the bad editing and lame scripting in exchange for beautiful costumes, fun dancing, and great melodrama.",1403654400,,1203,4.758454106280193
2125665,5,B0002VEV9S,"This is my 5th jump into Bollywood (I'm a caucasian American of European descent). I've already forgotten the names of the others except for Vivah, but in all the others (including Vivah), the characters aren't really developed - they stay the way they began, although the circumstances around them change, and the purpose seems no larger than to tell an attractive fairy tale.

Pardes is different and much more than a romance. It is a striking illustration of how very beautiful and valuable aspects of Indian culture and values not only can't merge with those of the West, they can not even survive it. Good, happy, pure Ganga, personification of India, is all but destroyed by the efforts of American Indian businessman Kishorilal to unite her with his Americanized son Rajiv, the opposite personification of the West.

I've read the other reviews that criticize the film for blaming every evil human characteristic on Westernization and the values of the West, and I agree that the film deserves this criticism. There is no recognition that many Americans also hate our drug-infested culture and the ugly explosion of tacitly condoned immorality that illustrates a concurrent growing cultural, moral and spiritual void; and we also would definitely find the handsome but violent, dishonorable, contemptible, selfish, bullying Rajiv loathsome.

Additionally, another reviewer was very astute in pointing out that the dark side of Indian culture is completely glossed over: Both Arjun and Ganga, though they have remained entirely honorable in the face of a growing attraction, come very close to being killed without any legal repercussion by the outraged fathers who's marriage contract has fallen apart. Ganga even lists the ways she is willing to die after she has told the truth about her separation from Rajiv: Fire, poison or starvation. She is in fact in immediate danger of all of the above before the movie ends. Arjun also is all but killed, first by Ganga's father, then by Rajiv, and then by Kishorilal, who invites him to ""honorably"" commit suicide with a gun he has handy, though he clearly intends to murder Arjun with it if he does not agree.

But the film is compelling, and so are the two lead actors (that is, once the movie gets going, after the first hour). Ganga has a key scene where she rejects ""love"" that offers nothing deeper than to force her to become another meaningless decoration in Kishorlilal's wealthy golden palace; of which the sterile, synthetic, hotel-like interior proclaims its ultimate emptiness of value. Arjun also refuses to lay down his life for Kishorilal's refusal to see the truth, although up to this moment in the film, Arjun has certainly laid down his life for his uncle in every other way. Kishorilal is forced to recognize that his compromises to Western ways have created a monster in his son, and that his attempts to unite Ganga (all of India's culture and values that he loves) to Rajiv (the West), have all but destroyed Ganga. The larger message is that Indian and Western morality can not be merged; the West will remain unchanged, while Indian culture and values will be destroyed.

This message is ultimately debatable. As an American, I definitely would like to see the beautiful and moral aspects of Indian culture take over America; but I would also like the darker, more horrible aspects of Indian culture such as caste crimes, acid attacks, dowry torture and bride-burning, which are just as much a part of India as the good things, to be left behind. I think ultimately human nature produces both beautiful and evil values in every culture; throughout history, every culture that discards an old evil somehow winds up attaching itself to a new one instead. However, this would be insanely difficult to get into a story on film. But, this movie did a wonderful job of casting an unapologetic spotlight on the sick things that are all too often tacitly and openly condoned in America and the West, while justly praising and illustrating the value and beauty of strong Indian moral values, something we definitely now lack.

Overall, I found this to be the strongest movie from India I've seen, and the best story and film I've seen in quite a long time.",1402617600,,4225,4.926966292134831

2125680,4,B0002VEV9S,Interesting movie that juxtaposes the extremes within and between American and Indian culture with regard to socioeconomic status and gender roles.

2125683,1,B0002VEV9S,"At first, I just thought that the film was boring...which for the most part, it is, at least in the beginning. And when I saw SRK dancing, I thought, ""Oh please, don't let this be another Dil To Pagal Hai"". But as it progressed, I realized how extremely prejudiced, offensive, and ignorant the script is. I would have much preferred to watch Dil To Pagal Hai again.

I am a Black American who absolutely loves Bollywood films. But if this were the first one I had seen, I don't think I would have continued watching Bollywood movies.

The way that America is portrayed is extremely ridiculous and off-base. There are awful people in ALL cultures, yes, even in precious India. America is not perfect, but what country is? Definitely not India. I mean my gosh, the girl's father (SPOILER) tries to KILL her for ""disgracing the family"" and gets a hug like ten minutes later! What?! In the awful country that is America, his behind would be in prison where he belongs! Give me a break. Rajiv is a jerk who also deserves to be in prison but his brand of disgusting, I'm pretty sure, can be found in countries other than America. And let's not forget the fact that the whole film is extremely patriarchal. At one point they have a stupid match to win what is apparently an object (i.e. the girl) in India, while said object is watching from the sidelines, unable to make a decision for herself.

Now, I'm not here to bash India, especially since most of its values are admirable. Like I said, no country is perfect. I would not have had such a huge problem with the film had it not portrayed all Americans as over-sexual, violent pigs. Extremely wrong and just plain old stupid. Sure, some of the values in this country are questionable, but not every one adheres to them.

I thought that the acting was well-done, it's just that everything else was awful. I like SRK as an actor and thought he was good. The lead actress was good, although she was annoying and a bit much at times. Some of the music was nice, too. But that's really about it. I've seen 20+ Bollywood films (a relatively new fan) and this 1 is so close to making me feel differently about the industry as a whole. But I think it's because I just watched it and I had to write a review. That's how disgusted I am by it. I understand that some of the extreme situations may have been necessary to emphasize the point of patriotism, but did the director really need to take a whole country down to do that? I definitely need some time to remember that not all Bollywood films are like this. Thank God.",1391731200,,2559,4.438297872340425

I miss the old musicals of the early days of Hollywood and these take me back.  Lots of fun because Bollywood makes me sing and dance and this one is no exception.  A bit more modern but still has a lot of the old values concerning relationships.  Love the good boy/bad boy and the innocent girls triangle.  An enjoyable movie!,1389830400,,472,4.4186046511627906

2125704,4,B0002VEV9S,"If this has happened in real life it's because the Rajivs began with the old Asian attitude that women are second class citizens, subject to the rule of the men in their lives and even regarded as their property; to this add the conceit that comes with being raised in oppulence and denied nothing all your life, and the social status of a family of wealth and position; then top it off with his being raised in the environment of the loose morals of the Western world of our day:  even without the first ingredient that's a recipe for producing Rajivs in any culture.

On the other hand, Arjun's circumstances usually produc people who are humble, appreciative of good fortune, empathetic to the suffering of others, etc.

If people outside our culture see us as such a decadent society isn't there some justification?  If they haven't spent time in America associating with members of the moral minority how would they know we exist?  How can they know anything about the American character, other than what they've been shown in what Hollywood produces or in any American magazine they might be exposed to???  Look at our divorce rate, acceptance of sexual relations outside of marriage, pre-marital co-habitation and the number of abortions ( mostlly used as a birth-control method) tolerated in our society.  Most comedien's humor is based on sex.  Look at the attire of people around you -- our grandmothers would be shocked if thely could see how our women wear their underwear for outerwear.

I love Bollywood productions because they are so moral.  It's so refreshing to watch their love scenes, in which intensely emotional, virtuous, self-sacrificing love and romance are portrayed without the lovers even kissing.  Hollywood has become so explicit, voyeuristic and obscene that it hardly produces anything watchable anymore.

As for this Bollywood production, I love it -- might even buy it.  It has some formula scenes, like the fight between Arjun and Rajiv where you think SRK should have been incapacitated by the beating he has taken and then he gets up and wipes out the whole gang that just attacked him.  It doesn't quite merit five stars, but it is absolutely worth watching.",1376956800,5,2196,4.915989159891599

And they both have the same director in common Subhash Ghai strikes again only this time he makes Sharuhk Khan a victim of his singular ability to make people waste hours of their lives! Heck I'm only rating it two stars out of respect for Mr. Khan! He may not be my favorite of the Khans but I've got a great deal of admiration for his charisma and showmanship. And believe me he's the only reason I made it through the whole three hours. There is so much to be angry about with this movie I hardly know where to start...

1. Why all the prejudice! Okay, I understand resenting the fact that the country was overrun by the west and a lot of its values and traditions were spat on for generations. I don't think it's wrong to want to retain those traditions and values. BUT first of all, India isn't the first country to go through that. Second, as the director pointed out twice when this movie was made (1997) the country was celebrating 50 years of independence so they won. Third, America had nothing to do with it!

Don't get me wrong, I'm not in the least bit snobby about being an American, I'm eternally grateful for the Constitution and The Bill of Rights, but national pride is not something I indulge in. Other countries have constitutions too. But I AM offended by the fact that in this movie and in Yaadein, the idea that ALL Westerners and English speaking people (in particular) are basically immoral, unethical, selfish, stupid, and without any concept of family. I don't deny Western Society has its share of major problems, and yes on the whole it's values lean more to the individual rather than groups, BUT there is no reason to condemn an entire population of people! How would Mr. Ghai like it if an American director made movies set in India where ALL the men were portrayed as gang rapists and women haters? I doubt he'd be pleased. *I* would be furious with such a person!

So of course I'm upset that the scummy villain in this film is deemed scummy because he isn't a Hindustani, but an AMERICAN! Please gag me, Rajiv was scum because he did bad things and it had nothing to do with where he grew up. He could get alcohol, drugs, and girls even if he'd been raised in Delhi.

Again I don't have an issue with denouncing guys like Rajiv. They are immoral. But there are men like him in every single country on the planet! I think that most of the values Ghai tried to honor are laudable: family, sacrifice, moderation, respect, loyalty, friendship, and yes... chastity, SHOULD be honored by everyone not just native Hindustanis.

But he very continently glossed over the values that allowed an innocent boy and girl to be abused and their lives put at risk. Oh no those values get fifteen minutes of light scolding compared to three hours of Western/NRI/ABCD bashing. NRI stands for Non-Resident Indian, and ABCD stands for American Born Confused Desi. Way to go Mr. Ghai, it's nice to know that you don't like killing people.

2. This movie is way too long! Okay, in general I love the fact that the average Bollywood film is three hours long. I have insomnia. But even if I hadn't been so upset by the treatment of anyone with any connection to the west, this movie is STILL too long. It really didn't need to repeat the same song three times, and really some scenes just drag on terribly. Mr. Ghai didn't edit this one on his own but he must have told the editor, 'just trim a little off the top.'

3. The Heroine, and the Villain weren't all that great. I'll give Ms. Chaudhry a pass. It was her debut, and she was so much better than Ameesha Patel in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaho-Na-Pyaar-Hai/dp/B000Q66FGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaho Na Pyaar Hai</a>&nbsp;and I love that movie!  Apoorva Agnihotri (these names are so awesome) as Rajiv is underwhelming. But I'm blaming that on the director and the script until I see him in another movie. This was also his debut. Two of my very favorite character actors in Hindi Films, Alok Nath and Amrish Puri were great in the beginning, but by the last act were an unholy mess! Again blaming the script and Mr. Ghai.

Okay that's more negativity than I can stand. There are one or two positive things to say so that I don't feel like I've wasted three hours of life I can never get back...

1. Sharukh Khan, I usually DON'T like to call him King Khan because while I respect him as a talented person and a popular entertainer I don't think he's the best actor in Bollywood. He's just not versatile enough for my taste. That said, in this ONE instance I'll bow, he saves what little there is to save in this travesty of a movie. His performance is compelling and authentic. Granted, he spouts some western hate at the end but that's his job. He did it well, and he really made the most of making sure the chemistry between him and Ms. Chaudhry felt natural. He made her truly shine in there scenes together.

2. The gaggle of kiddies. India has some of the best child actors in the world they're just fun. Kids make everything better.

3. The locations in India, just gorgeous as always.

I didn't like the music, so no joy there, and there was no dancing to really sink my teeth into. The numbers were short and unimpressive.

Bottom line, I have to remind myself that Ghai is responsible for Aishwarya Rai's Bollywood film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taal/dp/B003UHUYHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taal</a>&nbsp;and that will be the last Ghai film I ever see if I can help it!

If you want some Bollywood movies that truly illustrate GOOD cultural values, and don't demonize anyone who speaks English try...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhie-Gham/dp/B0016GOMZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vivah/dp/B003DHVU6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vivah</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mujhse-Dosti-Karoge/dp/B00009PAC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mujhse Dosti Karoge</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dil-chahta-hai/dp/B0016GOM0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dil chahta hai</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Na-Tum-Jaano-Na-Hum/dp/B000IZJRJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Na Tum Jaano Na Hum</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-2-DVD-Set-Special-Edition-English-Subtitles-Second-Disc-Includes-Special-Features/dp/B00AJW6J1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2-DVD Set / Special Edition / English Subtitles / Second Disc Includes Special Features)</a>",1367366400,7,7137,5.595370370370371
