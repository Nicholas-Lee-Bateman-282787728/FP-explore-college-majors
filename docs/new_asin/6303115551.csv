7839112,3,6303115551,"A dying Klingon beams onboard the station and suddenly the entire crew (minus Odo) becomes infected with the William Shatner over-acting virus.  Well, that's not exactly true; a few of the performances are laced with subtleties.  But for the most part, this is just an excuse to get the regular actors to perform out of character.  And for the most part, this is amusing and quite watchable.
A power-struggle breaks out between Sisko and Kira.  Kira becomes overly aggressive, while Sisko retreats into himself.  O'Brien turns into a suspicious, McCarthy-type figure, questioning everyone's loyalty and mistrustful of outsiders.  It's fun to see the cast get a rest from their usual characters, and they obviously relish the opportunity.  I was particularly impressed by Avery Brooks' restrained performance as a detached and reclusive figure, only occasionally lashing out.  On the other hand, it's a pity that Dax seemed to get stuck with the dopey, ditzy portion of the virus.
Overall, I liked this one.  The altered personas make for entertaining viewing, as does watching Odo slowly work his way through the mystery.  His manipulation of Bashir's changed personality is particularly good bit of writing, and the short scene of Quark as a pretend whiplash victim is a hilarious highlight.",1061683200,,1292,5.1980676328502415
7839113,2,6303115551,"Oh dear.  Two less-than-stellar episodes in a row here.  THE PASSENGER suffers for a single reason, and that is that its central premise is buried so deep inside technobabble that I simply couldn't make myself care about it.
The storyline revolves around a ship containing a prisoner and a captor.  The prisoner has apparently died, while the captor insists that he is alive, based on the fact that he has managed to fake his own death many times before.  This leads to an extended ""he's alive"", ""no, he's dead"", ""no he's dead"" argument, where nothing terribly interesting happens.
The only way for me to describe this episode is ""silly"".  The plot is silly.  The technobabble is silly.  And during the story's climax, even the acting is quite silly (though to be fair to the performer(s), there isn't much to work with here).  This isn't an episode that you laugh with; it's one you laugh at.",1060473600,,893,4.716129032258064
7839114,4,6303115551,"This is a great episode that moves the spotlight away from Sisko to Bashir and Odo who take the ball and run with it. You see, someone has an evil  criminal in their mind, controlling them, manipulating them and the  station, with Bashir, Odo and Kira acting strangely... where is HE?",966643200,2,284,4.549019607843137
7839115,4,6303115551,"I thought this was very good, they showed the model of Deep Space Nine.  They explained a little about how they did the sound effects, for instance, how they put in the laser beam effect after they fire a phaser. It was very  interesting how they explained how they made Odo's shapeshifting scene's  look real. and each of the actors explained a little about their parts, but  I was surprised that avery brooks did not make an appearance on this video.  Terry did a very good job on this tour.",962236800,14,493,4.433333333333334
7839116,4,6303115551,"this episode dissects for us, the deranged steps people take in their so called quest for ascending to power , of course because right is on THEIR side,and the other side therefore is ,by necessity, a traitor ,and an  oppressor. As if anyone who has ever wrested power from an evil ruler ,by  plotting and deceit ever turned out to be a lesser evil.  this  episode,made me reflect, and it made me aware ,again of all the pettiness  we all have to keep curbed , unless we become tyrants in one form or  another. Very powerful acting by all the crew,an again and again veiwing  for me and my trekkie husband.",949276800,4,606,4.405405405405405
