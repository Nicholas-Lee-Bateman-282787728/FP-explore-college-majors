4492626,5,B004X7VRJY,I absolutley LOVE this show!! and the theme song too. Its REALLY captivating AND fun to watch these guys make guns and blow stuff up,1314403200,12,132,4.32
4492627,5,B004X7VRJY,"Sons of Guns is a great show and is recommended to everyone who likes guns or wants to know more about them. SoG can be very informative when it comes to learning how things work with guns, you can always count on a history lesson because they get alot of historical weapons and the guys at Red Jacket Firearms do a good job at informing their audience. They always have a new challenge to conquer, they have alot of fun doing it and a ton of gunpowder at their disposal. I hate to compare this to American Chopper but if you like watching those guys build iron horses then you'll like watching the team at RJF build and modify an arsenal of hand cannons. This is my second favorite show to watch on television and is a must see for gun enthusiasts.",1313798400,19,749,4.28169014084507

4492629,4,B004X7VRJY,"Never saw the TV show.  Bought the DVD expecting ""Top Shot Meets Orange County Choppers.""  Show's approach is different from my expectation but, what the heck, it's my expectation that was wrong -- nothing wrong with the show.",1334534400,,226,4.921052631578948
4492630,5,B004X7VRJY,"This DVD set is not available in the UK so I ordered it from Amazon USA. I was amazed when it arrived in 4 days. An excellent series, fascinating to see the ingenuity of these guys in solving some very complex firearms related problems. This DVD set is of interest not only to firearms enthusiasts but also anyone interested in light engineering.",1334361600,,346,4.596774193548387
4492631,5,B004X7VRJY,"This is a great show, and was a great purchase on Amazon.  It's fun to watch, and the purchase transaction was as smooth as silk.  Watching for other seasons to come out so I can buy them too.",1326067200,,192,4.026315789473684
4492632,5,B004X7VRJY,"Best guilty pleasures  watched show ever! Love the show, love the cast, and best of all you will never see Kim Kardashian with in a 100 miles of the show.

Just good old boy, coon ars, gun toting, fun loving people who will keep their values no matter what the producers say.",1322265600,4,329,4.222222222222222
4492633,5,B004X7VRJY,"The Sons of Guns DVD is a permanent recording of a fantastic television series.  The first season disc is a great addition to my video entertainment collection.  Will Hayden and all the folks at Red Jacket Firearms of Baton Rouge, Louisiana really exemplify how the success of a small southern specialty business catches on like wildfire across a national viewing audience.  I'm really looking forward to purchasing the second season DVD through Amazon.com when available.",1319241600,3,472,5.266666666666667
4492634,5,B004X7VRJY,"You don't need to be a gun guy to thoroughly enjoy this show, which has one of the best new theme songs on television.  As a middle aged female who's never even shot a gun, I look forward to this show each Wednesday night on Discovery Channel.  Every show features problem solving with modern and antique weaponry using interesting explanations of historical issues and current engineering considerations.  The characters are real people and the situations and comments are often hilarious and appropriate for all but the preschool set.  Amazon's price for the first season DVD is very affordable, allowing me to give them as gifts to friends who may not have cable or satellite tv, and they are always well received and appreciated.  Every show has a payoff at the end where things are blown up or restored weapons are demonstrated.  Every guy loves that, which helps make it a favorite among males of all ages and a must see for all the families I know.
It's easy to see why this is one of Discovery Channel's highest rated shows!",1319155200,6,1032,4.705555555555556

8446421,5,B004X7VRJY,"Very cool to see these guys work on a variety of weapons.  Sad they pulled this show off the air after Sandy Hook.  This is a great way to revisit all the cool modifications they made.  Redjacket's motto= ""If you can dream it, we can build it.""",1362096000,,244,4.148936170212766
8446422,2,B004X7VRJY,"Thought this was about building guns.  This is another reality show with set up guests.  Also when they do actually build a part or edit a gun they don't show you what they did.  Its a ""secret"".  Save your money until you can pick it up for $5 used/new",1361491200,,252,4.081632653061225
