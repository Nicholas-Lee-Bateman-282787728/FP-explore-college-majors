7897931,4,6305933650,"This is a very sexy movie.  If you enjoy Indian folklore, it's a sexy, romantic, mystic and exotic movie.  It's a bit slow-moving, but enjoyable for those who like to delve into the unexplained.",1261958400,,194,4.676470588235294
7897932,3,6305933650,"This movie was O.K.  Some of it was really good- the scenery of Arizona and New Mexico, and some of the conversation between the two main (and almost only) characters.
Jackie and Eugene accidentally realize one day that they can communicate across 500 miles via a windtunnel, which the Indians say is a blessing.  They have one conversation and then 7 years pass, as Eugene decides to leave home.  We see that he ends up in Philadelphia, living a less-than-enviable life, and when he returns, he and Jackie find each other again and they have one long night of communication.
Some things that I did not like about this movie: I felt there was not enough character development for me to understand who these people were, why they did what they did, or to even care about them.
Also, probably a minor point, but WHY does it say that Adam Ant is one of the stars when we only see him for two minutes?  And he's not even a character, he's just a guy on T.V.!
I was curious as to how it would all turn out, and the ending was what it should have been, so that was good.
All in all, interesting, but......meh.",1210636800,2,1103,4.365853658536586
7897933,3,6305933650,"This was a pretty good film about finding the courage to stand up against difficult times and following your dreams. The main characters of the movie find a mystical wind tunnel which enables them to communicate from Arizona to New Mexico, and they hold meaningful conversations about life's trials. I found this to be inspiring, if somewhat slow in places. You might want to check it out to get your own opinion. This was mine.",1150243200,,428,4.72
7897934,4,6305933650,"This is a tremendous love story between Jackie (Heather Graham) and Eugene (Michael A. Nickles). They meet by chance through a mystical Indian wind tunnel that allows them to hear each other while being hundreds of miles apart. Well, years go by and they meet again through the same wind tunnel and begin to share the stories of their lives.
At first it seems like a slow sleepy dialogue based film, but gradually it starts weaving it's magic on you. The way that can only be done in the American Southwest, which is definately the 3rd main character here.
When I started watching this I thought I was going to fall asleep, it was 3am and I had just about had it. Then something amazing happened, their dialogue wrapped around me like a warm blanket. I felt so safe, it was an incredible experience. Heather Graham's performance was wonderfully poignant and charming. My eyes and ears were glued to her every movement, her every word.
This is what independent film is all about, stories that come straight  from the heart, with truth and honesty and just a pinch of pure magic...",1006214400,11,1079,4.649214659685864
