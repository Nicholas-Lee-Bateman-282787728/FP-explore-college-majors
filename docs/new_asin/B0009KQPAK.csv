2299227,5,B0009KQPAK,"This is the version of The Secret Garden to watch! My eight year old daughter and I recently read the book together and loved it. (It was my first reading) We anxiously looked forward to seeing a filmed version, and the first one we saw was Agnieszeka Holland's 1997 version, as that was the only one available at our local library.  We were both terribly dissappointed. Holland's version takes such liberties with the story as to sacrifice the true spirit, beauty and depth of the book. Yes, it is gorgeously filmed, but the cinematography (which includes some very tacky special effects such as sped up roots growing in soil) does not compensate for the slaughter of the story and characters. The garden itself is so fantastical as to make a mockery of its significance to the story.

This version is completely truthful to the book. The story is developed carefully and thouroughly, and presented in great detail. The characters are rich and reminded both my daughter and myself of how we had imagined them to be. The English countryside is faithfully portrayed as only the English know how. It is delightful to enjoy true Yorkshire accents which are an important theme in the book, even if they are sometimes difficult to understand for american ears. The garden is gentle and real. Yes there are some minor flaws (some lines are actually flubbed in a couple of the final episodes) but they are inconsequential. If you have taken the time to read the book, then by all means take the time to see this movie. You will be glad you did.",1144022400,47,1537,4.688888888888889
2299228,2,B0009KQPAK,"The 1993 movie version of The Secret Garden captures the magic of the inspiring story for both children and adults, while the BBC television version does not.  It's plodding style, avalanche of dialogue, and low production standards let the inherent magic escape. No matter how hard they try, multiple repetitions of the word ""magic"" do not make the TV show magical.

Some portions of the TV dialogue are lost in thick Yorkshire accents and unintelligible dialect, interesting only to language scholars. At the other extreme are too many wordy explanations of what we just saw happen and plainly heard spoken.  Just because a television script corresponds closely to a beloved book does not necessarily mean that it makes good television, or that it captures the spirit of the book.

Children are capable of understanding that something special or wonderful is happening simply by watching the event take place. The 1993 movie clearly knows this and wisely lets a picture speak a thousand words.

The movie version communicates a vibrant love of life. You get to know the unique, even eccentric, characters as though they were real people struggling with hardships and fears. Without contrived manipulations, you are drawn into the depths and heights of their emotions through the use of stunning visuals, dramatic portrayals, pithy dialogue, moments of quiet contemplation, and a serene musical soundtrack that is worth owning on its own merits.

In the TV episodes, on the other hand, a lot of effort is expended but no real drama is achieved. For example, during what could be quiet, thoughtful moments of solitude, the mood is often spoiled with a voice-over or with the use of grainy film for outdoor scenes - a distracting contrast to the clear videotape used in indoor sets. I've never been made so aware of production methods and camera angles. I'd rather just sit back and enjoy.

The BBC actors are good and appear capable of much better performances, but the director was content with their shallow characterizations and a few instances of mumbling, garbling, and stumbling over their lines. At several points I expected to hear the director yell, ""Cut. Try it again."" Unfortunately, it's not up to normally high BBC standards.

It's nice to have a better choice.",1135728000,15,2274,5.029255319148936
2299229,5,B0009KQPAK,"It is a pity that so many people are misled into buying the 1993 version or the Hallmark version of this book.  The former is valuable as a study of wooden acting and unbelievable dialogue.  The Hallmark version (as usual) just throws the book away--they can do it better.  The 1949 version also ""improves"" on the book by turning it into a suspense-thriller in the first half and has all the characteristics of '40s movies--phony characters, phony dialogue and big stars.

This movie is for people who loved the book; and except for extremely minor flaws which most people will not notice, this movie brings the whole book to life perfectly.  Nothing is left out.  Sarah Hollis Andrews gives a stunning performance for one so young.  None of the California accents of the Hallmark version or the East European characters of the 1993 version.  This is Yorkshire and this is Francis Hodgson Burnett, not Agnieszka Holland.

There has been an abridged version on the market for years, cut to make it a full-length movie (100 minutes).  This present version is twice that length.  Even if you have the abridged version, buy this one and see what a difference those cuts make.  The characters are even more sympathetic and more real, and there is time to deal more with all the other characters (the nurse, Dr. Craven, Mr. Craven, etc.) and more time for Mary Lennox and more interaction between Mary and Collin and Dickon.

In short, this movie is a treasure and every child above the age of 8 deserves to see this version.  If you are a diehard and want to see the other versions, fine, or if you've already been suckered into buying them.  But get this version.  You'll never watch those other versions again.  And your kids will have an experience to carry with them the rest of their lives.",1128384000,121,1790,4.667731629392971
2299230,5,B0009KQPAK,"I got to see about three and a bit of the seven episodes when this series aired on ABC (our national TV and radio broadcaster in Australia) back in 1980 when I was 10 years old. Just from these bits I saw, I always wanted to see the episodes and bits I missed back then. I always felt this was the finest bit of children's TV programming I've ever seen on TV. Nothing since has ever come close to this. I't s a pity now children don't see things like this now. They now get dumb downed stuff that comes from multi-national corporations which is linked to junk food ads and constant merchandising.

I am so glad that the BBC decided to offer all seven episodes put back to back of this series after all these years. It was long overdue!",1126569600,24,735,4.212765957446808
2299231,5,B0009KQPAK,"The oft-filmed Frances Hodgson Burnett novel The Secret Garden was restaged for BBC television in 1975 Sarah Hollis Andrews stars as the insufferable brat who is yanked from her home in India and sent to live with her emotionless uncle. She is humbled by her equally headstrong crippled cousin, and humanized by the gardener's son, who entreats her into his special fantasy world. As Andrews is taught the values of humility and generosity by ""the secret garden,"" she simultaneously warms her uncle's cold heart. Not quite as elaborate as the famous 1949 MGM version, nor as accomplished as the 1993 Agnezia Holland-directed remake, this 1975 Secret Garden nonetheless has a charm of its own.

This was first  shown here in the USA on PBS in 1976 on the PBS series  ONCE UPON A CLASSIC that was hosted by Bill Bixby.  I remember watching SECRET GARDEN for the 7 weeks it was shown on this series.

Watching  this  on DVD brought  tears to my  eyes because its such  a wonderful  version  and, it  brings me back  29 years ago when I first  saw this.",1122249600,45,1049,4.655737704918033

2299261,4,B0009KQPAK,"A young child is sent from a far country to live with a relative in a gloomy old aristocratic pile. But there are dark mysteries concerning both the estate  and the relative.  In the course of solving them, the child brings a new understanding to both herself and her relative.

From this outline of the story of The Secret Garden, it should be clear how similar it is to the better known book and film Little Lord Fauntleroy.  Both are based on the immensely popular 19th century young people's books by British-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett, and both have been the subject of numerous theatrical, film, and television versions. Of the half dozen or so film/tv treatments, many feel that this 1949 version with  Margaret O'Brien, Herbert Marshall, Dean Stockwell, and Elsa Lanchester is the best. The acting is very good to excellent, and the atmosphere of the old house with its ruined garden effectively conveyed.  The screenplay is co-authored by Robert Ardrey, who later became well known as a popular science author for such works as African Genesis. An interesting feature of the film from a cinematic viewpoint is the sudden switch from black and white to color (as was done famously in The Wizard of Oz) to highlight the happier scenes.

Though the film, like the book, is ostensibly for young people, it's one that can equally be enjoyed by adults. Of course it's sentimental, but this is the type of film where the sentimentality is the whole point: viewers who dislike sentimentality shouldn't be watching it.

The Warner Archive standard DVD is of good quality.",1465603200,,1584,4.884328358208955

It doesn't have the cinematographic beauty of the Warner Bros. version, but that's okay because the real beauty of The Secret Garden is in the story.  The very best lines from the text of the book (""Why does no one come?,"" ""Might I have a bit of earth?"" etc.) are included, and the Yorkshire accents are delightful.  It's not perfect, but if you have readers in the house, their imaginations will fill in the gaps from their love of the story.

2299291,5,B0009KQPAK,"""The Secret Garden"" has always been close to my heart.  The novel and the movie.  Well, this 1949 movie version to be specific.  All other film versions pale in comparison.  This is mostly due to the wonderful performances by the young cast members.  Margaret O'Brien has some very nice moments, as does Brian Roper as Dickon. But it's Dean Stockwell who leaves a lasting impression for me.  Great honest performance, and incredible for an actor his age at the time.  The veterans fare well also.  Herbert Marshall is sufficiently tortured as the afflicted lord of the manor.  And Gladys Cooper, Elsa Lanchester, and Reginald Owen all serve their characters well.  I love the look of this film.  The black and white sequences are wonderfully evocative of the moodiness of the manor, and the lighting is done to perfection. The full technicolor sequences in the secret garden are lush and opulent.
I saw this film as a youngster, and it really made an impression on me.  I finally found a VHS version of the film and was content to have it my

This version, of course, is one of the earliest, if not the first. Lots of talent in the film: O'Brien, Dean Stockwell, Elsa Lanchester...and George Zucco (I love him)! The story is well represented and played out. The use of color for contrast, important in the way it was in The Wizard of Oz. Personally, I find that black and white adds to the mystique. Some may object to any deviation from the book. I can live with it, as long as the movie plays well, which it does. In a way, I like the various interpretations of the story.

The editing was very poor; so poor, in fact, there were multiple times when the characters moved rapidly as if someone had pushed the fast forward button on an old VCR. The nuances of the story were unclear and the characters were flat and not engaging. I chose to watch this version with my children because another reviewer said it was her favorite and the most similar to the book. But I felt this adaptation took a poignant and magical story and robbed it of its charm and depth. I do often prefer older and less glossy versions of films, but this was a poor one.",1416009600,,622,4.3247863247863245

Phenomenal acting from all, but especially the child actors who are astonishingly powerful in their roles.  This really is an amazing film.  It was filmed mostly in black and white, but toward the end there is a color sequence that brings real power to that scene in a surprisingly innovative technique for that time.
This is a movie that could become one of your all-time favorites as it has for me if you have never seen it before as I hadn't.  I doubt that this wonderful film will ever grow old and would bet that it will have much impact on audiences far into the future.

2299349,5,B0009KQPAK,"This is my overall favorite video version of THE SECRET GARDEN.  It is well acted and the most faithful to the book.  I am only sorry that it is dated, with faded color, poor quality video, sound, and very little in the way of a musical score.  That doesn't ruin it for me, but it is a little more work to watch than some of the newer films.

If there is ever another try to make this story into a movie or series, I wish they would use this script to work from.  There have been two versions since this one, but neither lives up to the quality of this screenplay.  The 1993 version is beautifully done, but takes too many liberties with the story; changing the plot in some really significant ways.  The 1987 Hallmark version is also OK, but is a  bit dull in comparison, with wooden acting and terrible accents.  The Hallmark version is saved from total ruin by the appearance of a young Colin Firth as the adult Colin Craven - (Another deviation from the original book, but an interesting take all the same.)

But this version is excellent - taking enough time for a genuine telling of the whole story.  The cast is perfect, with The character of Mary striking that delicate balance of a good hearted girl who has been made nasty by her circumstances.  She is believable as a little brat, and also believable when Mary's true nature begins to emerge.  Dickon is a wonderful moor-elf, and Colin is the epitome of a little ""lord of the manor"".

THE SECRET GARDEN is an excellent story for all ages and deserves a faithful telling.  This is so good that it is really worth the effort to watch, even if the technology is dated and the budget was low to begin with.  A real hidden gem.",1404777600,2,1683,4.363344051446945

DEAN STOCKWELL, another incredible child star has a central role too, and O'BRIEN and STOCKWELL together make this film UNFORGETTABLE. ELSA LANCHESTER, one of the greatest character actresses of all time is in this film too! And as a bonus, you'll see a RAVEN that should have won an Oscar in the category ""Birds."" What a movie!

2299368,5,B0009KQPAK,"I have at least three ""The Secret Garden"" films. This one is the most faithful to the book. There are areas that it strays--the scenes with John and Martha playing with Mary are not in the book and a few other ones. But overall I really enjoyed this rendition. Sarah Hollis Andrews plays Mary the way the book pictured her. An odd child unfeeling and unemotional except for temper but she changes slowly and we get to see that. I wish it had been longer because the book had other scenes I would have liked to seen played out and more of Ben Weatherstaff. But taken all together this is the best I've seen yet. If you are looking for this book in movie form, I really think this is the best but be sure you get the full presentation. It is around 210 minutes. There is a shortened one that only runs 100 minutes but it cuts out a lot of storyline.

There is a very realistic portrayal of the class system in India and England. It was well portrayed maybe glossed over a little because I think a servant's life must have been very hard. Some may find that objectionable but the story is truly about two unloved children learning to like themselves and see and feel compassion for the people around them. I do think that comes through in small areas, such as when Colin thanks the nurse for his drink. The look on her face shows the distance he had come from being a miserable little beast that no one cared about or wanted to being a more normal child. There is no way to erase this era because it happened. This film doesn't condone it but it does betray it so we have an idea of how different times were.",1387584000,5,1605,4.262295081967213

The wonderful story really puts you into the thoughts of a young child. The themes of the film are wonderful:
Moving on from the grief of the death of a loved one.
Letting go of the past and moving on to the future.
Growing up.
Healing.

While this film is a good drama, its also noteworthy that there are many funny scenes. One kid throws a tantrum and throws things, while another walks in and tries to stop him by also screaming and throwing things. It is a brilliant scene.

This DVD looks and sounds better than most Warner Archives. Some look too soft.",1372550400,,622,4.486725663716814

2299380,5,B0009KQPAK,"I have just received my newly remastered Warner Archive DVD of MGM's 1949 adaptation of ""The Secret Garden"", the first and, for many, the best sound version of the famous children's classic written by Frances Hodgson Burnett. This black and white film with beautiful Technicolor sequences here makes its DVD debut and is very well done all round, with child star legends Dean Stockwell and Margaret O'Brien, acting at full throttle, practically striking sparks off each other in some key scenes. O'Brien plays an embittered English orphan brought from India to live at her uncle's mansion on the bleak Yorkshire moors. There, she befriends a local boy, Dickon (Brian Roper) and discovers her equally embittered, but bedridden, crippled cousin, Colin Craven (Stockwell), who isn't as much of a cripple as his father (Herbert Marshall), for his own nefarious reasons, has led him to believe he is, as well as uncovering the secret of a beautiful and magic garden that will soon change all of their lives forever. Highly Recommended DVD, with excellent picture and sound quality and vividly colourful Technicolor sequences of the title garden. Going by his hair, it appears that Dean Stockwell went straight from his last scenes on 20th Century-Fox's ""Down to the Sea in Ships"" in November, 1948, straight on to filming ""The Secret Garden"" at MGM.",1369872000,41,1344,5.085972850678733

2299386,2,B0009KQPAK,"This version of The Secret Garden was, at best, just ok.

The movie flowed too quickly from key scene to key scene.  There was no sense of the time that it took for Mary to lose the worst of her contrary disposition or for Colin to become well.  No development whatsoever, just boom! Mary's nice. Boom! Daddy's home and Colin's walking.  It wouldn't have taken that much extra for the director to show the passage of time.

I felt I was watching a recitation of lines...was I supposed to believe that Archibald Craven was mourning his wife?  The actor didn't convey it.  He seemed rather fatherly for a man who was mourning his wife, ignoring his son, and who previously had not wanted to see his niece.  Was I supposed to believe that Colin was sick or that he thought he was dying?  It would have been nice if the actors could have conveyed feeling and depth instead of such perfunctory recitation.

2299388,1,B0009KQPAK,"This adaptation is faithful to story line and accents, etc.  My problem is with the story itself.  I think its time has passed.  This story portrays a time when upper class children forced servants to their knees to shine shoes, threatened servants with punishment, and made 70 year olds stand at attention.  It is also rooted in a time when it was acceptable for parents to care nothing for their children's upbringing and to leave it all to servants--thus the mother and father who didn't love the girl Mary and left her in a cholera epidemic, and the father who neglected Colin to the point that the boy became psychosomatically disabled and left him to the care of a doctor who wanted the boy dead.  Unlike Dickens or Austen whose writings overtly criticize such societal evils, this story takes a neutral (or even positive) stance.  I wouldn't want my kids to watch this.  I would have to explain to them the thoughtless, cruel, savagely proud demeanor of the children in the story.

If you are watching this for engaging entertainment, I can only say I found it slow paced in the extreme.  The Yorkshire accents (not at all helped by poor sound quality) will leave many Americans (especially children) unable to follow the dialogue. Cinematography was also less than the usual BBC quality.",1302998400,4,1295,4.771300448430493
2299389,4,B0009KQPAK,"I rented this movie, but it might be worth purchasing the DVD if you really like it. There's not much technology in this BBC TV version, but it is a very close adaptation of the story.  The acting, although a little stilted at the beginning, gets better later on, and the actors have very realistic accents for the time and place.  The outdoor scenes look quite authentic even though they were filmed in Scotland instead of England, where the story is set.  I liked the appearance of the English robin throughout the program.  It's quite different from our American bird, and it gave the original story a ""garden"" atmosphere.  Some of garden scenes looked a bit artificial, which is difficult to understand since most of this production was quite natural in appearance. But elsewhere there's plenty of real flora and fauna to keep you believing you're in a botanical place. Overall, this BBC television version is very good in faithfulness to the original book by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It should be enjoyed as a classic by both children and adults.",1261353600,,1051,4.816666666666666
2299390,5,B0009KQPAK,"This 1975 BBC adaptation is the best and most loyal adaptation of the children's classic ""The Secret Garden"" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. At approximately 210 minutes, this adaptation is the only one that does the novel justice.

I have also viewed two other adaptations of ""The Secret Garden."" Neither adaptation does the novel justice. Yet, in my opinion the 1987 adaptation by Hallmark is better than the 1993 Warner adaptation. Both the Hallmark and Warner adaptation are about 100 minutes.

Below I compare and contrast the three color adaptations.

1. The 1975 adaptation BBC

This adaptation is very low budgeted, and it shows in the picture quality, which is painful even if you are used to BBC 4.3 aspect ratio films. This said, the film is QUITE GOOD in every other way if loyalty in plot is important to you. For example, Mr. Archibald Craven, Ben W., Martha, Martha's mother, etc. are given larger roles in this adaptation than in the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Furthermore, a considerably amount of the dialogue is taken directly from the novel. Therefore, this adaptation is much less 'sound bites' and allows for the development of Mary, Dickon, and Collin's characters.

The acting is also considerably better than the 1987 adaptation and better than the 1993 adaptation. [Unfortunately, with child actors of probably 10 or 11 years of age who have memorize a large amount of script, errors will be evident.]

Yet, the 1975 adaptation is the best adaptation in my opinion. It is neither too mystical (1993) nor too gothic (1987). I just is the story of a family and a garden that brings them together.

I rated this adaptation five starts because of the script and acting - NOT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE QUALITY, which would have to be rated 1 star or two at most.

2. The 1987 adaptation Hallmark

Although I know many individuals despise this adaptation, I enjoyed it for a change. Yes, the acting is not perfect and the accents are horrible. Yes, the ending is pathetic and quite changed from the novel. Yes, the mystical Dickon (as an adult) dies in World War I. Yet, when one considers what the film was trying to achieve (i.e. change the theme from a children's story to a social critique of problems in society), it does an effective job. The film is a little too gothic (in the Victorian literature definition -i.e. 'ghosts' and long, dark corridors), yet I did not think the gothic harmed the story but rather created a sense of anticipation.

Again, if you want a loyal adaptation, I would urge the the 1975 adaptation. However, if you are tired of watching the 1975 adaptation and want to see a change, this 1987 adaptation is a better choice than the 1993 adaptation.

3. The 1993 adaptation Time Warner

I disliked this adaptation. My first problem was that Mary's parents were killed in an earthquake rather than a plague. (I am not certain what this proved?). Secondly, the mystical music was annoying as were the inappropriate accents - although of the two, I could tolerate the poor accents much more than the poor music.

Additionally, other scenes were also altered. For example, Mary finds the key to the garden in her deceased aunt's bedroom in the shut up wing of the Manor. In the 1975 adaptation (and I think the 1987 adaptation also), Mary finds the key buried with some help from a robin. However, the robin does show Mary where the door to the garden is located.

Unfortunately, the other problem I have with this film is that it is centered almost exclusively on Mary's character. Where the 1975 adaptation provides other characters (ex: Martha, Dr. Craven, Sir Archibald Craven, and Martha's mother have with numerous scenes in which Mary does not appear.) In the Warner adaptation, Mary is the focus of nearly every scene.

Also, Collin's character was considerably altered into less dictatorial that in the novel the other film adaptations. In fact, at times, Collin appears very childish and timid - terrified of dying and of Mrs. Medlock (rather than bossing Mrs. Medlock, his nurse, and everyone else around). Why Mrs. Medlock and the whole staff of of the Manor had to wear masks when around Collin, I have not a clue? (I forget if everyone wearing a mask was in the novel or not, but it makes no sense in this film adaptation.)

However, the film does have some positives. The Manor house is considerably larger than in the 1975 adaptation and larger than the 1987 adaptation, and therefore, it becomes more believable that Mary could have mistaken Collin's crying for the wind, rather than know outrightly that it was someone crying.",1259280000,5,4582,4.7956852791878175
2299391,4,B0009KQPAK,"This is the only good film adaptation of Francis Hodgson Burnett's book available, and it's not perfect.  It has glaring continuity and filmography flaws, but if you are a fan of the book, you won't care.

The photography is absolutely gorgeous almost throughout the film.  The locations are breathtaking.  The costuming is brilliant, and very authentic.  The acting is outstanding.  The writing could be improved upon, but it is absolutely faithful to the original story.

The photography, costuming and casting are so good that many scenes look like Tasha Tudor illustrations come to life.  The little actors that portray Mary and Collin exactly fit their literary descriptions.  Ben Weatherstaff, Mrs. Medlock and Dickon look and speak exactly as they should.  Their thick Yorkshire accents may put some viewers off, but many others will enjoy these lilting voices.

The producers needed more money. They did an incredibly good job with what they had; the production values are very high, yet the film looks low budget, especially to American eyes.  Don't expect this to look like a Disney movie.  That said, you won't find a better adaptation.  Other versions concentrate on the fairy tale aspect of the story and thereby lose the gritty authenticity of it's actual setting, and, regretably, of the Yorkshire characters that are so important to the original story.",1254700800,7,1368,5.159090909090909

2299393,5,B0009KQPAK,"Having read ""The Secret Garden"" as a child, I watched the PBS version in the 1970's, and was totally entertained by all of the episodes. I owned a video tape of the theatrical version of this production. The theatrical version was good, but left out rich details of the story. With this DVD, the complete series is available to those who remember watching it on television, and for those who wish to see a version closer to the book.

You get more background on Susan Sowerby, and you see her close relationship with Mrs. Medlock. There is also more interaction among Mary Lennox, her cousin Colin Craven, Dickon Sowerby, and Martha Sowerby. There is more of the book in this release.

It also presents the story as it was shown on television -- opening and closing credits, theme music. The color of the production then, especially the outdoors scenes was very muted, but some of the indoor scenes have gained more color. The muted color palette doesn't diminish the production, but gives it the feel of watching illustrations from a book. It is totally enjoyable. Highly recommended.",1249689600,4,1085,4.7967914438502675
2299394,5,B0009KQPAK,"For the person who asked, this is NOT the version where the kids appear at the end as adults.  That is the 1980's version starring Gennie James.  It's a very good version, too, although not quite as true to the book.  I think this version has the best ""Colin"" and probably the best ""Mary Lennox"".  I confess to liking the ""Dickon"" on the 1940's version best, though.  I have all of the versions that I've ever heard of and I really think this one is the best although I have to say that I kind of like seeing Mary and Colin as adults, even though that was NOT in the book.  I noticed that version didn't have them as cousins either; probably because they ended up married to each other and first cousins marrying is not as widely accepted in America.  Anyway, if you want the truest to the book and with the most authentic accents and scenery, this is your best bet.  And it's a great story.",1244764800,,891,4.261904761904762

2299399,5,B0009KQPAK,"I saw this version on a PBS series called 'Once Upon a Classic' back when I was in High School.  The version of 'Heidi' was also excellent...I hope to see it available soon.

I read the book to my girls in the late 80's, having  seen it on TV only the one time.  Later, when the condensed video came to our local library, we watched it together and I realized that I'd gotten the pronunciation spot-on (except for the ""th'"").  That in itself speaks volumes for the wonderful impression this portrayal had on me.  It remains in the heart and soul, not just the cognitive brain.  By the way, the daughters were pleased.

Also, bravo to all involved in the film.  While every other adaptation took the plot and wandered right off the page with it, this piece captured the flavor, spirit and joy of the book.  It may be cliche but, ""the book was better"" applies perfectly to 1949, 1993, and any others out there in the ether.

A 1985 BBC version of 'A Little Princess' is out there somewhere, too.  Please bring the full-length show to the market...I'll buy.",1188259200,3,1054,4.460732984293194
2299400,5,B0009KQPAK,"The abbreviated VHS version of this BBC rendition of The Secret Garden was one of my favorite films as a child, so it was with some trepidation that I ordered this lengthier DVD. I didn't know whether the additional scenes would add to the story, or detract from it. After watching one half-hour episode a night for a week, I can say that I was quite impressed by how faithfully the full length rendition stuck to the original story. No other adaptation that I've encountered, (and I've encountered many of them, including an audio drama and a musical stage play,) was content to stick to Francis Hodgson Burnett's simple childhood tale. In this case, however, there were only a few deviations, the most notable being the presence of John, the footman, who plays a brief, nameless role in the book, but is a fairly important supporting character in this version. This, like the other fairly small alterations, is mainly an exposition device, and takes the place of narration.

 There are places where this film shows its budgetary constraints. The titles aren't as clean as they could be, and whenever the robin appears it is obviously via stock footage. The garden, which is clearly on a sound stage, does not appear to contain any trees large enough to sit in, let alone fall out of. But all of these things are minor quibbles, and there's a lot to make up for them. The costuming and the Yorkshire accents are spot on, and all of the characters look exactly the way that they are described in the book, down to the smallest detail. I would recommend this classic to anyone who enjoyed the original story, and doesn't feel the need to see it 'enhanced' with dramatic subplots.",1177977600,18,1678,4.684745762711865
2299401,5,B0009KQPAK,"I recently watched an abridged version of this movie and plan to purchase the full version as I want to know what sections are missing and because I love the way the British depict a story.  What was shown in the l00 plus minutes to me was lovely to say the least!  I would not say that this film was cheaply made at all, in fact I was impressed with the decors of the rooms, the dress of the characters and the look of the large home from outside and the countryside.  Yes, there is slight grainy filming only when the characters go outside, but it is not really that bad and when they enter the garden it looks normal like the inside of the house.  To me this did not take away from the film.  I also enjoyed the accents of the characters and the interaction between characters.  I did not find it hard at all to understand their speech and I felt that the characters had great concern and emotion for one another.  I was surprised that Colin's father actually appeared normal and rather nice because I had watched two other versions of this movie and felt the 1993 version though beautiful to watch was not so realistic nor did I feel the characters were as loving towards one another especially the head maid and Colin's father toward Colin or Mary. The father was extremely unrealistic and foreboding in that version.  I watched the 1949 version and the acting was somewhat overdone and the movie was dark overall. I felt in this BBC version that all the characters started out somewhat disliking one another but all came around and even Colin's father and the head maid showed care and concern for Mary and I was happy that it was a very happy story.  I also liked the character development and much interaction between the maids and the children without hatred shown and the sets were just right and not fake at all.  The garden was just that...a garden a realistic garden. I can't wait to see the longer version because the pace of the BBC movies is nice and slow giving time to developing the characters!! If you like realism and getting to know the characters without a lot of overplay and hype this is the version for you!!",1172620800,5,2134,4.434782608695652
2299402,5,B0009KQPAK,"I am so glad to see this DVD finally released in the U.S. We watched this version of The Secret Garden in England in 1975 when it was produced for the BBC. We arranged our calendar around the excellent and accurate productions of the timeless children's classic books. BBC productions are known for their accurate portrayal of the author's intent. The Secret Garden did not disappoint. Each character was so carefully cast that we felt we were inside the book. Sarah Hollis Andrews IS Mary Lennox--in looks as well as demeanor. And Martha and Dickon and all the other characters are so perfectly cast. No detail is overlooked. The script is true to the book and the detail in the settings, the authentic accents in the speech, all are so perfect. I am always put off by movies that distort stories in order to add dramatic flair and romance, thinking the book wasn't strong enough in its own right. If you want to watch the Hallmark production or any of the others, do so, but see this one FIRST. You will be transported right into the pages of the book and you will live with the characters as they grow.  The emotion you will feel will far surpass anything that can be wrought by the Hallmark version. This is a wonderful family film. If you have not read the book, I recommend that, also, unabridged, of course.

Seeing this released gives me hope that more of the BBC classics might come to DVD in the U.S. I am still waiting for their version of Carrie's War, A Little Princess, Heidi, all of which we saw come alive in the 1975 BBC television series.",1167177600,11,1556,4.4946996466431095
