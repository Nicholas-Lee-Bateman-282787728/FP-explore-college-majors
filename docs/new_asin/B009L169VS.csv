8542720,5,B009L169VS,"Only Japan could think of a great story involving cute high school girls doing an school activity involving tanks. If liberals are supposed to be truly ""tolerant"" and ""open-minded,"" they'll put aside their pre-judgments that this is pro-Nazi or imperialist Japan blah-blah-blah (no it ain't) and will find that this is just a show about Japanese high schools whose schools are built upon cities on massive aircraft carriers with each school having a theme from countries around the world and portraying them in a fun and comedic way. But then again, you really can't talk sense to liberals so if they feel that this anime threatens them in someway, I'm sure they'll try to find a way to ban it by passing stupid laws like they usually do.",1463788800,,738,4.7734375

8542722,1,B009L169VS,"This anime is totally stupid and even a bit offensive. For some odd reason--they don't feel the need to explain in a timely fashion--people live on cities built on giant battle ships and High School girls have a strange love for WWII era tanks. They use the tanks in war game battles (with real ammo) to score points and these games often take place in the middle of towns (or on select fields). The girls believe that boys will like them and want to marry them if they are good at this ""sport"" so that's like the prize in the sweet cereal box to them. (That is just one of the things that I find annoying about this anime. The selling point for this ""game"" is to make girls believe that the only way to get married is to have the ability to drive a tank. Really? The boys won't find them attractive for their personality, they have to have a special skill set?)
The feel of the anime is very pro Nazi (one girl even wears parts of an SS uniform) and pro Imperial Japan while being anti American and anti British. (I think its sick to take a ""cute"" view of a world war in which millions of people died at the hands of the Nazis and the Japanese. No amount of cute big eyed girls will change that raw fact.) Pass on this one and buy Fate, Stay Night, Bleach, Sword Art Online, Akira, Black Cat, Naruto Shippuden, The Big O or AKB0048 instead. At least these anime make sense, are enjoyable and some even cost a lot less. This is my personal opinion and if you like this anime then that's okay. Please note that I am a life long anime fan and have seen a good number of series (read countless manga, even back when it wasn't popular in the USA and very difficult to get) and attended a good number of conventions. I am a fan of anime so I can honestly tell you when something is not up to my standards and this one is NOT up to my standards. Let's face it, not all anime is good just as not all movies or TV shows are good and not everyone will like the same things. Don't waste valuable time on things you don't enjoy, its time you can never get back.",1372896000,,2050,4.140350877192983
