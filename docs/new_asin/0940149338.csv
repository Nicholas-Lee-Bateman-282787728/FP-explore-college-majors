7793488,5,0940149338,"It took me a few viewings of this video before I truly realized just what an incredible training aid it was.  This video deals with much more than simply how to throw high kicks; this video provides valuable information on ALL aspects of powerful kicks.  Video is the most appropriate format for this type of material and Mac Mierzejewski is an incredible martial artist to learn from.  The video starts with video clips from some of Mac's martial arts championship fights and the footage is truly amazing.  You'll find yourself wincing as you see him knock down and knock out his unfortunate opponents.

The video is densely packed with tips on the finer points of kicking techniques, an array of valuable exercises, and stretching information.  You'll want to watch this video with one finger on the pause button of your VCR remote. Kicks are shown in both normal speed and slow-motion to allow the viewer to grasp all of what they are seeing.  The narration points out some of the more important technique points, however, there is so much that one can learn from watching these kicks that many viewers will find themselves rewinding and watching certain segments over and over again.

As with most products from Stadion Publishing, emphasis is placed on the correct progression of exercises.  The kicking instruction starts from the basic knee-kick which is designed to hammer home the importance of raising the knee high and driving in with the hips on ALL kicks.  Basic kicks like front snap kicks and side thrust kicks are followed by more elaborate kicks such as cresent and the always-spectacular spinning hook kick.  Each section is devoted to a specific kick and is introduced with footage from Mac's matches and a short example of using the kick to defend oneself in a typical street encounter.  Training exercises require only the most basic equipment such as chairs and bungee cords.  Exercises for both individual and partner assisted training are shown.

I have watched this video more times than I can remember and never fail to get something new out of it everytime I watch.  This video is highly recommended for all martial artists that require the ability to deliver powerful kicks, regardless of their skill level or flexibility.  My kicks have improved in their height and power after studying this tape.  There is so much in this video that it will most likely require multiple viewings before its full value is appreciated.  This product has my highest recommendation.",1096848000,7,2492,4.9352517985611515
