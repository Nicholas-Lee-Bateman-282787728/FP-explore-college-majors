4992804,3,B006J75ZSU,"Maybe I watched too many Zombie movies over the past year, but I really enjoyed this one.  The characters were likeable and the acting and effects were decent. The story dragged in a few places and some of the dialog took you out of the movie.  That being said, it was a very fun movie and I would defintely watch it again.",1336348800,2,323,4.193548387096774
4992805,1,B006J75ZSU,I'm pretty sure I could find better actors in the county jailhouse.  Terrible movie in all respects. The first 30 minutes was so painful I turned it off.,1379203200,,153,4.464285714285714
4992806,1,B006J75ZSU,This movie was horrible. They must of had a $20 budget. I lost almost two hours of my life I can never get back by watching this trash.,1378598400,,135,3.857142857142857
4992807,3,B006J75ZSU,I love any zombie movies and have seen all made that I know of.  This is the worst one I've seen.  I laughed through the whole thing so I gave it a 3 stars review because it could make me laugh.,1375228800,4,194,3.707317073170732
4992808,1,B006J75ZSU,"I love zombie movies even B-grade. This movie was terrible! Horrible effects, horrible acting. I couldn't even finish watching it, it was so bad. Any 12 year old with a camcorder could do this! I don't even write reviews. I have probably done 3 in the last 15 years and this was so bad that it inspired me to do one! Beware!",1370390400,2,324,4.241935483870968
4992809,4,B006J75ZSU,It's not that bad. Low budget? Yes. Bad acting? Pretty much. Drawn out scenes? Yep. And still I watched it all and was bummed when it was over. Not as bad as some say.,1366588800,,167,3.9411764705882355
4992810,4,B006J75ZSU,"I gave it 4 stars and here is why.

I've seen my share of terribly done horror movies on amazon prime. I mean so awful Amazon should just give me my $70 for Prime back just for watching the awfulness. BUT this film is not as bad as those. Sure the zombies were not made into Hollywood perfection and sure some of the effects (like the killings and zombie eatings) were not very good, but it's to be expected from a low budget film.

As for the acting. Again not hollywood perfection, but they(some) did a very good job.

As for how the students got infected...I still don't know. I got to tell you the explanation of the ""virus"" was terrible.

Also why didn't any help come? 3 students had cell phones that worked yet neither called for 911 or any help for that matter. After the fire, there were no emergency teams. Again not convincing, you'd have to give an explanation as to why no one is responding to a burning building. Where was security and other school staff members? There is certainly alot to criticize about for sure, but I give them lots of credit for putting something good together compared to the amature junk I've seen. The camera and audio was very good compared to others. if this was an amature college film, they did a great job.

PS Dana Dirado is gorgeous! And ofcourse she doesnt have  a facebook or twitter so i can stalk her like I do all my others ""evil laugh""",1366329600,3,1388,4.3604651162790695
4992811,2,B006J75ZSU,"There are good zombie movies and there are bad zombie movies.  This  one is bad.  Lame plot, lousy acting, unbelievable characters.  If you like brainless college movies you might enjoy this one.",1361923200,2,195,5.0
4992812,2,B006J75ZSU,"The plot was bad, the acting was bad and the zombies were bad.  I didn't like it very much.  Not for Zombie afficionado's.",1360454400,2,122,4.260869565217392
4992813,3,B006J75ZSU,"This is the more recent of two zombie films by the same name. College kids are trapped on campus during a zombie outbreak of unknown origin. The geek (Brian Oviedo) had perhaps the best lines relating everything to Star Trek. There was an entertaining zombie scene where zombies are consuming body parts, kegger style, with one zombie actually being held upside down while he eats. Nice Touch. However the writers couldn't maintain a decent script and dialouge in spite of using quirky characters.

This is not the worse zombie film out there, but it barely makes 3 stars.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1349049600,2,616,4.857142857142857
4992814,1,B006J75ZSU,"First off this film shouldn't be confused with the 2006 film that was also entitled Dorm of the Dead. If you judge either by quality of the film they'd be hard to tell about but the plots, characters, etc are completely different. It kind of worried me for a moment that I may be losing my taste for budget zombie films. I was worried because I have to say that the last 4 that I've seen really left a bad taste in my mouth. This worry quickly drove me to check out other reviews of the film online and quickly I learned one important thing - I couldn't find a single one that gave this a positive review. WHEW! There aren't a lot of people who have seen the movie and I'm not sure if adding one will give the film more attention or drive people away from it. I'm kind of hoping for the second option.

Unless you are George A. Romero can you please stop making a ""MOVIENAME of the Dead"" and come up with an original title? I'm sorry I know you are trying to give it as a tribute but really at this point if it has nothing to do with Romero's universe or based off of it there is no reason to keep using the naming scheme.

So in the film we're going to see a clearly indie made film about a zombie outbreak that occurs on a campus that is somehow cutoff from the rest of the world. The person who is broadcasting from the student news area is explained that the broadcast is on a closed loop so no one outside can see anything but cell phones and more work yet they can't seem to find help. I know what you are thinking about our cast of college kids who are stuck on a campus that yes phones are down because there is an outbreak everywhere but that doesn't seem to be the case. Also in our group of survivors (lead by 2 brothers who are at odds with one another) they seem to only have 1 car between the lot of them which will not hold everyone. With the car's owner keeping quiet about it we see the crew traveling between buildings for safety they don't seem to utilize them for any reason.

While we clearly see dorm rooms, a library, and the remains of a frat party turned zombie none if it screams 'hey we're at college and all going to die' in a way to get the adrenaline pumping. Speaking of the frat party one might ask why everyone stayed there to become of of the undead instead of all running in terror or why none of the zombies wandered off after. Add in the fact that you really don't care about the characters and you may end this one before getting through the entire movie.

The zombies themselves are nothing special either. We're really treated to some quick makeup that isn't shown on screen for that long with some quick and not so gruesome kills. While I've seen worse films I was pretty much bored ten minutes in and stayed that way throughout the majority of the film. It isn't the worse thing out there but I wouldn't recommend viewing this one unless you are desperate to see every zombie film that is out there. Really this film ended up being all filler and no killer.",1348963200,,2999,4.192374350086655

8499247,1,B006J75ZSU,"This one is a STINKER.  No redeeming values at all.  So bad, I turned it off after 10 minutes.  Did it get better after that?  No idea...but I sincerely doubt it.",1411689600,,162,4.129032258064516
8499248,1,B006J75ZSU,Just sucked...Watched about 15 minutes of it then had to turn it off.,1411084800,,69,4.384615384615385
8499249,1,B006J75ZSU,"I only lasted a few minutes.  Everything about it was bad: editing, acting, dialogue, direction, sets.  On the plus side, it should give aspiring filmmakers hope.  You too can make a movie that can be seen on Amazon.",1400716800,,216,4.631578947368421
8499250,1,B006J75ZSU,i gave it 15 minutes... i wanted to kill it at 1 minute... the beginning elevator scene sets the mood for the rest... i even clicked forward some... just... just don't unless you need something to make fun of...,1400198400,,211,4.435897435897436
8499251,3,B006J75ZSU,"the first 20 mins are horrible, and there are pretty bad parts after that as well.....BUT, there are some really good scenes in this movie, once it gets going the dialogue gets better....with action going on, the bad acting isn't as noticeable, and brian oviedo comes into the story as jorge, a very entertaining nerd....really, i think he makes the movie, i watched it a second time because of him....and on the 2nd viewing, i liked the movie better overall as well-over the top drama issues while zombies attack, good ole low budget effects. blood and guts and gore....yeah, i enjoyed it....but the first twenty minutes.....there to set up the story i guess, but still boring, bad acting, bad music, bad writing, just bad....oh, and as another pointed out.....what's with the occasional phones working? and when they do, no one ever calls a parent, the police, 911?",1396483200,,867,4.904761904761905
8499252,3,B006J75ZSU,It  was good better camera quality would have taken it to another level. Some death scenes could have been better but im sure they had a budget. I still enjoyed and would watch again. Great job guys.,1392681600,,199,4.378378378378378
8499253,1,B006J75ZSU,This was another waste of time movie that I turned off pretty quickly. Don't bother to watch any of it.,1380412800,,103,4.2
8499254,1,B006J75ZSU,This was low quality recording and a terrible plot. It looks like it was filmed with a cheap home camera.,1379548800,,105,4.3
