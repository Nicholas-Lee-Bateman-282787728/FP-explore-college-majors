2964144,5,B000WC38OQ,"Being a fan of the Ultraman series, I was curious when it was announced that BCI had acquired the distribution rights for this rather obscure series.

Very little information was known beforehand, however, a good friend recommended I check it out.

When I did, I was thoroughly impressed by many things regarding this series. For one, it is very unique amongst similar giant hero programs released at the time.  For one, there are essentially two main characters, Gentaro and Goro, who travel the country, going from town to town, protecting people and stopping the bad guys.  (which has very early shades of 'Supernatural' regarding the Winchester boys, especially with the comedic bickering they share)

This works exceptionally well in that the character development is focused solely on Gentaro and Goro, as opposed to having to deal with a large government team of agents like in most Ultraman type shows.

in addition, the bad guys in question are all too human, they've just gotten their hands on some pretty advanced technology (in the form of giant robots) and use that technology to terrorize innocent civilians in their bid to take control of Japan, and from there the world.  It isn't until much later in the series do aliens come to invade the planet.

And of course, the piece de resistance is the fact that the titular hero is not in fact the main character.  What I mean is that Gentaro, the lead agent is not the one who transforms into Iron King, rather it is his sidekick (the seemingly bumbling Clark Kentish Goro) who has that distinct honor.  Even so, in the early part of the series, usually it is Gentaro that is vital in helping Iron King defeat the bad guys (because in the early episodes Iron King has no energy weapons, that doesn't come until later in the series).

These are unique factors which help turn the cliches and conventions of typical Henshin Kaiju series like Ultraman inside out.

The picture quality, while not remastered, is still very good, and even the dirt and grain adds something of a grindhouse like quality to the proceedings.

This is especially true during the first episode, where there is a moment when Iron King is about to deliver a devastating kick to the bad guy in question, and suddenly the picture goes completely dark, and about 2 seconds later the picture comes back, almost as though it had just come back from a commerical break, which I found to be very funny.

I highly recommend this series to fans of Tokusatsu programs in general, to fans of Ultraman or even Henshin Kaiju programs in general and fancy something a little different, by all means, check out this series.  :)",1196553600,31,2644,4.75492341356674

2964146,5,B000WC38OQ,"BCI's recent release of IRON KING has become a gem in my collection just like their release of SHADOW WARRIORS season one. All 26 episodes of the complete series are spread throughout 4 DVDs. The qulity, while not remastered, is excellent. The insert- with info, bios, and interviews supplied by August Ragone -may contain spoilers but is a wonderful addition.  I would have to beleive anyone would become a fan of a show that uses spies, robots, ninjas, aliens, martial-arts, and romance all in one program - AND USES THEM WELL!!! I highly recommend this series for anyone looking for something unusal and a load of fun for any age group.",1196380800,11,639,4.756756756756757
2964147,5,B000WC38OQ,"As a fan of these Japanese super hero shows, both new and old, I was quite surprised by this series (or should I say shocked - Iron Shocked!). I found Iron King to be very unique and quite entertaining. Far beyond what I expected, given similar shows from the same period.

For those familiar with the these types of shows (Tokusatsu Heroes) they will find particularly interesting, as I did, the fact that the title hero isn't actually the lead character, quite different from it's contemporaries. While it is the musical yet tough Gentaro Shizuka who acts as hero when faced with human sized adversaries, it is his seemingly comical and bumbling sidedkick, Goro Kirishima, who has the power to transform in the giant cyborg Iron King to face off against the giant foes. Yet even this does not stop Gentaro from challenging the giants to aid Iron King. And like this the two men, real characters who play off each other very well in both comedic and dramatic moments, travel around Japan trying to put down technologically advanced domestic terrorist organizations and alien invaders.

Some may not be able to get past the age of the series, or the fact that even compared to some of it's contemporaries the monster costumes and some of the special effects are not so spectacular, and sometimes unintentionally comical (though I happened to find many of the effects were not only ambitious, but in certain instances very well pulled off), but once beyond that there is a fantastic story to be found. One mixed with drama, comedy, music, some romance, and a great deal of action.

As far as the DVD box set itself, it is beautifully designed. The box is colorful and eye catching, featuring the title hero in a striking pose on the front with the show's two leads in action on the back. The DVD case art is simple by contrast but still stands out with the name logo and hero's four pointed crest emblazoned on the cover. The included booklet, also fantastically designed, features an extensive write up on the series with detailed background information on the series and those who made it. as well as interviews with the two lead actors.

I loved this show and the DVD set, both which I recommend to anyone who likes Japanese sci-fi dramas like Ultraman, Godzilla, and even Kamen Rider.

I am very much looking forward to future similar releases by BCI/Eclipse(Something the purchase of this title will ensure).",1196380800,3,2412,4.760765550239235

2964162,5,B000WC38OQ,"Just a warning to those who complain about such things ; Though there are English captions, all these episodes are in Japanese. Fun, crazy and entertaining as heck, this collection is broken up into three story lines. First is a weirdly racist plot line that shines a weird light on the largely ignored subject of Japanese ethnicity. You see, the Japanese islands are largely dominated by the Yamato ethnic group, but there are others...and the first ten or so episodes feature the Shiranui trying to destroy/dominate/eject the Yamato through the use of...well, giant robots. Then we have another (less interesting) brick of episodes involving some guys dressed at mock Arabs (terrorists?) of the Phantom Opposition Party who use giant dinosaur robots, and finally...a race of AWESOME ALIENS called the 'Titanians' who look very 'V for Vendetta' and turn into giant bugs.

  I warn you...Star Trek this isn't. It's not even as by-the-books as Ultraman or Johnny Sokko. This is a WEIRD series...but it's all the more entertaining for it.",1402617600,4,1036,5.118343195266272

The is a vulnerability to Iron King but he is always there when he is needed and Gentaro is charming yet is able to get himself out of every danger with his amazing skills.

2964164,4,B000WC38OQ,"Once again here's another classic Japanese tokusatsu series from the same production team. That brought you the Ultraman series, this 26 episode series starring Shoji Ishibashi as Gentaro Shizuka. A special agent of the Japan's National Security Forces. Wanders the countryside accompanied by a somewhat geeky hiker Goro Kirishima. Played by Mitsuo Hamada, battling  terrorist organizations that threaten Japan and the world . But little does Gentaro know that Goro , really is the giant cyborg superhero Iron King. Watching this series brought back memories of not only Ultraman , but also Godzilla . Which are coincedentally made by the same person the late Eiji Tsuburaya. And now with the new Godzilla movie debuting in May, which i hope does well. I thought it was time to add to my tokusatsu section of my dvd collection. Even though this series was made in the 1960's/1970's era, and the special effects and monster designs are outdated . By today's standards a lot of the techniques in this series are still being used in today's tokusatsu t.v. shows.

2964180,4,B000WC38OQ,"Greetings and thank you for checking out my review. Being a BIG fan of the original ULTRAMAN and JONNY SOKKO series, I purchased this sight-unseen, because I thought it to be a worthy follow-up. Produced in the early 1970's and (supposedly) produced by the same people who created the original ULTRAMAN series, IRON KING is very similar to theme and action, but it seems to skewer MUCH younger for audiences. The premise is much more simple than the ULTRAMAN or ULTRA 7 series. The monster designs aren't nearly as interesting or entertaining. And considering that the series took place nearly a decade after the classic Tsuburaya series, the special effects and direction is pretty standard stuff. They really hadn't refined the children's television format, nor did they increase the budgets or special effects. But aside from the two male leads, there are LOTS of fine babes-of-the-week who guest star and get in on the monster action. Only problem is - they have a real affinity for killing them off! (Four die in the brief series run.) Overall though, complete episodes, SOLID transfers, good music and fun, harmless entertainment. Kids should dig it and will appreciate the zany fun. Good weekend viewing at a TERRIFIC Price!",1371513600,6,1231,5.009756097560976
2964181,4,B000WC38OQ,"I found the series to be campy fun. In reminiscent of Ultraman, Iron King is a person who under went a scientific experiment that gave him super human powers. Giving him a limited time to battle robots and monsters because he needs water to fight. I found this to be absolutely hysterical. Lots of fun adventures this series was made back in 1973, such a different time period because the main characters slap women and each other which is wrong by today, but back then never questioned. It is sometimes just to funny when they do it. If you liked Ultraman, by all means check this out. There are no extras on the disc. It is also in Japanese with English Subtitles only. Give it a check and have a good laugh.",1371340800,,710,4.386363636363637

2964184,3,B000WC38OQ,"Not near the production value as the better known Ultraman series ( and there are a lot of those ) this came out during the monster craze of the late 1960's in Japan as competition to Ultraman. The story is of a wondering guitar player and his buddy.  His belt turns into a kind of majic sword, and his buddy is the avatar that turns into the Iron King to battle various monsters. If you love the general genre, you should like this well enough. If you are hoping this will be as good as Ultraman or Ultraman Seven, you will be disappointed.  Look to Johnny Sokko and the Giant Robot for something closer to Ultraman if you want something more Ultraman-ish.",1361750400,,657,4.377049180327869
2964185,4,B000WC38OQ,Yeah its a good deal. Not the best quality but worth the price in my opinion. I do wish they could have done something more other than the black slip sleaves on the discs.,1357171200,,171,4.0588235294117645

2964187,4,B000WC38OQ,"When I first saw this, I thought it would just be a bad knock-off of Ultra Man (just look at Iron King's suit!). However, it's almost nothing alike. While the monster battles are pretty lame, the villains are so crazy and cooky you can easily forgive them. My favorite aspect of the show is the acting; I love watching the banter between Gentaro and Goro, and the actors manage to make their characters both believable and memorable. I almost like this show better than Ultra Man just because of the acting.",1309824000,,507,4.582417582417582
2964198,5,B000WC38OQ,"This is a series I had never even heard of before proved so bad and so cheaply done that it proved highly entertaining and forced me to create what I call the ""Saki-Rating"" - as in "" how many bottles were drunk when the evil robots and creatures were designed.  Most I would rate a ""6"" with some closing in on ""10"", one robot would qualify for Handicaped-Parking.  I spent most of my time laughing in evil delight when Iron King would first encounter his foe, and unlike the ""expensively"" produced Ultraman, this poor guy often gets his rear handed to him the first time they face.  When the show is concentrating on things at the human scale you have the two heroes bouncing between goofball to serious, while the evil-doers are fairly cookie-cutter, and not all that bright.

The series is sub-titled in English, and sometimes I don't think the translations were quite literal.  About the only thing that annoyed me was the theme music, also played most of the time Iron King appeared, getting stuck in my head.  Packaging is good, with each of the three disks in it's own sleave in a sturdy case.

If high production values, creative writing, and great special effects are your thing, you may want to pass.  But if you recognise that sometimes ""bad"" has it's own charming qualities, this is a must for your collection at a bargain price.",1306886400,4,1340,4.600840336134453
2964199,4,B000WC38OQ,"A good bargain from Mill Creek on a classic show that still makes me laugh out loud at its disjointed storylines, confusing editing, and some of the best monsters-on-a-budget you'll ever see.  Sure, Iron King may be a rip-off of Ultraman, but its got a heck of a lot of charm that makes up for blatent copyright infringement.

When you pay $7 for a complete series of shows from Mill Creek, keep the expectations low.  No problems with video quality at all.  Picture is what you'd expect from an aged copy of a 1970s era show.  On a few episodes there is a bit of a lag in subtitles.  Out of the entire three disc set there were maybe three episodes that have noticable timing issues of a half-second to a second. Iron King hardly makes sense when the subtitles are spot on anyway, so just sit back and enjoy the inanity.  I didn't want to shell out the bucks for the BCI version, so this set will do.",1303862400,7,901,4.295857988165681

2964201,4,B000WC38OQ,"This series is in the same vein as Ultraman, the premier suitmation series of all time, but not nearly the quality. If, as I have, you have watched the Ultraman shows repeatedly over the years, this is at least something new that bears some resemblance to the various Ultra-series. However, it is even cheesier, if possible, and even more inane with its insistence on including songs by the star in each episode. The monsters are not as inventive or interesting and the overall feeling is one of lower quality all around. That said, there really aren't too many places you can go to get this level of outrageousness and pure camp. It will do until something better comes along. And, you can't beat the price.",1296691200,,708,4.672
2964202,1,B000WC38OQ,"I own both the BCI version and Mill Creek version of the Iron King DVD's. If you can find a copy of the BCI release I would highly recommend getting that version over the Mill Creek release. BCI is now out of business so those discs are harder to find. My reason is that the Mill Creek version is a very shoddy cheap re-release of the BCI version. The episodes are crammed onto 3 DVD's rather than the 4 dvd's in the BCI version. Normally this would not be a big deal only meaning higher compression artifacts and lower image quality however somewhere in the process Mill Creek screwed up the subtitles so that as you are watching the show they start to go out of sync with the voices. It eventually gets to the point where subtitles are appearing on the screen when there is no voice to go along with it. It's very annoying and makes watching the episodes much more difficult as you don't always know which subtitle goes with which speaker. From the price it's obvious Mill Creek's are a budget release but in my opinion it's worth the effort to find the original BCI release even if it costs a little more.

2964203,5,B000WC38OQ,"As the product description suggests, Iron King is a gloriously loopy Tokusastu Japanese superhero television show. It's filled with furious fast-paced action and campy humor. Brought to you by rhe same team that brought you Ultraman and Super Robot Red Baron, Iron King aired on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 8, 1972 to April 8, 1973, with a total of 26 episodes. It's about Gentaro Shizuka (Shoji Ishibashi), best described as a singing cowboy, and Goro Kirishima(Mitsuo Hamada)to stop The Shiranui clan who've planned to conquer Japan for over 2000 years for banishing them from the country by The Yamato clan. Each member of the S-clan controls a gigantic robot warrior in order to overthrow the Yamato Clan. It's not Gentaro but Goro who has the power to become Iron King by touching the medals on his Turning Hat, and shouting ""Iron Shock!"" when danger comes around. Transforming into Iron King quickly dehydrates Goro and he can only remain as Iron King for a short period of time so this cause problems but it's a good plot point. At the tenth episode, the S-clan is no more but a new group fills that gap called the Phantom Militia. Then, later on- Iron King battles the Titanians who can assume insect-like monster forms.

Fans of Ultraman, Red Baron, Kamen Rider, The Super Inframan, and others will love this show. I rather enjoyed it myself as it's in the tradition of Godzilla and all these other programs I've mentioned.",1275177600,4,1447,4.834677419354839

Like a lot of the tokusatsu shows of the 70s, this has fun since it's a kids show, but isn't afraid to kill people off and be a bit dark at times.

One mixed with drama, comedy, music, some romance, and a great deal of action.

As far as the DVD box set itself, it is beautifully designed. The box is colorful and eye catching, featuring the title hero in a striking pose on the front with the show's two leads in action on the back. The DVD case art is simple by contrast but still stands out with the name logo and hero's four pointed crest emblazoned on the cover. The included booklet, also fantastically designed, features an extensive write up on the series with detailed background information on the series and those who made it. as well as interviews with the two lead actors.

I loved this show and the DVD set, both which I recommend to anyone who likes Japanese sci-fi dramas like Ultraman, Godzilla, and even Kamen Rider.

I am very much looking forward to future similar releases by BCI/Eclipse(Something the purchase of this title will ensure).",1196380800,3,2412,4.760765550239235

Fun, crazy and entertaining as heck, this collection is broken up into three story lines. First is a weirdly racist plot line that shines a weird light on the largely ignored subject of Japanese ethnicity. You see, the Japanese islands are largely dominated by the Yamato ethnic group, but there are others...and the first ten or so episodes feature the Shiranui trying to destroy/dominate/eject the Yamato through the use of...well, giant robots. Then we have another (less interesting) brick of episodes involving some guys dressed at mock Arabs (terrorists?) of the Phantom Opposition Party who use giant dinosaur robots, and finally...a race of AWESOME ALIENS called the 'Titanians' who look very 'V for Vendetta' and turn into giant bugs.

  I warn you...Star Trek this isn't. It's not even as by-the-books as Ultraman or Johnny Sokko. This is a WEIRD series...but it's all the more entertaining for it.",1402617600,4,1036,5.118343195266272

But little does Gentaro know that Goro , really is the giant cyborg superhero Iron King. Watching this series brought back memories of not only Ultraman , but also Godzilla . Which are coincedentally made by the same person the late Eiji Tsuburaya. And now with the new Godzilla movie debuting in May, which i hope does well. I thought it was time to add to my tokusatsu section of my dvd collection. Even though this series was made in the 1960's/1970's era, and the special effects and monster designs are outdated .

Being a BIG fan of the original ULTRAMAN and JONNY SOKKO series, I purchased this sight-unseen, because I thought it to be a worthy follow-up. Produced in the early 1970's and (supposedly) produced by the same people who created the original ULTRAMAN series, IRON KING is very similar to theme and action, but it seems to skewer MUCH younger for audiences. The premise is much more simple than the ULTRAMAN or ULTRA 7 series. The monster designs aren't nearly as interesting or entertaining. And considering that the series took place nearly a decade after the classic Tsuburaya series, the special effects and direction is pretty standard stuff. They really hadn't refined the children's television format, nor did they increase the budgets or special effects. But aside from the two male leads, there are LOTS of fine babes-of-the-week who guest star and get in on the monster action. Only problem is - they have a real affinity for killing them off! (Four die in the brief series run.) Overall though, complete episodes, SOLID transfers, good music and fun, harmless entertainment. Kids should dig it and will appreciate the zany fun. Good weekend viewing at a TERRIFIC Price!",1371513600,6,1231,5.009756097560976
3198678,4,B000WC38OQ,"I found the series to be campy fun. In reminiscent of Ultraman, Iron King is a person who under went a scientific experiment that gave him super human powers. Giving him a limited time to battle robots and monsters because he needs water to fight. I found this to be absolutely hysterical. Lots of fun adventures this series was made back in 1973, such a different time period because the main characters slap women and each other which is wrong by today, but back then never questioned. It is sometimes just to funny when they do it. If you liked Ultraman, by all means check this out. There are no extras on the disc. It is also in Japanese with English Subtitles only.

The story is of a wondering guitar player and his buddy.  His belt turns into a kind of majic sword, and his buddy is the avatar that turns into the Iron King to battle various monsters. If you love the general genre, you should like this well enough. If you are hoping this will be as good as Ultraman or Ultraman Seven, you will be disappointed.

My favorite aspect of the show is the acting; I love watching the banter between Gentaro and Goro, and the actors manage to make their characters both believable and memorable.

3198695,5,B000WC38OQ,"This is a series I had never even heard of before proved so bad and so cheaply done that it proved highly entertaining and forced me to create what I call the ""Saki-Rating"" - as in "" how many bottles were drunk when the evil robots and creatures were designed.  Most I would rate a ""6"" with some closing in on ""10"", one robot would qualify for Handicaped-Parking.  I spent most of my time laughing in evil delight when Iron King would first encounter his foe, and unlike the ""expensively"" produced Ultraman, this poor guy often gets his rear handed to him the first time they face.  When the show is concentrating on things at the human scale you have the two heroes bouncing between goofball to serious, while the evil-doers are fairly cookie-cutter, and not all that bright.

The series is sub-titled in English, and sometimes I don't think the translations were quite literal.  About the only thing that annoyed me was the theme music, also played most of the time Iron King appeared, getting stuck in my head.  Packaging is good, with each of the three disks in it's own sleave in a sturdy case.

If high production values, creative writing, and great special effects are your thing, you may want to pass.  But if you recognise that sometimes ""bad"" has it's own charming qualities, this is a must for your collection at a bargain price.",1306886400,4,1340,4.600840336134453

Sure, Iron King may be a rip-off of Ultraman, but its got a heck of a lot of charm that makes up for blatent copyright infringement.

When you pay $7 for a complete series of shows from Mill Creek, keep the expectations low.  No problems with video quality at all.  Picture is what you'd expect from an aged copy of a 1970s era show.  On a few episodes there is a bit of a lag in subtitles.  Out of the entire three disc set there were maybe three episodes that have noticable timing issues of a half-second to a second. Iron King hardly makes sense when the subtitles are spot on anyway, so just sit back and enjoy the inanity.

If, as I have, you have watched the Ultraman shows repeatedly over the years, this is at least something new that bears some resemblance to the various Ultra-series. However, it is even cheesier, if possible, and even more inane with its insistence on including songs by the star in each episode. The monsters are not as inventive or interesting and the overall feeling is one of lower quality all around. That said, there really aren't too many places you can go to get this level of outrageousness and pure camp. It will do until something better comes along.

If you can find a copy of the BCI release I would highly recommend getting that version over the Mill Creek release. BCI is now out of business so those discs are harder to find. My reason is that the Mill Creek version is a very shoddy cheap re-release of the BCI version. The episodes are crammed onto 3 DVD's rather than the 4 dvd's in the BCI version. Normally this would not be a big deal only meaning higher compression artifacts and lower image quality however somewhere in the process Mill Creek screwed up the subtitles so that as you are watching the show they start to go out of sync with the voices. It eventually gets to the point where subtitles are appearing on the screen when there is no voice to go along with it. It's very annoying and makes watching the episodes much more difficult as you don't always know which subtitle goes with which speaker. From the price it's obvious Mill Creek's are a budget release but in my opinion it's worth the effort to find the original BCI release even if it costs a little more.

3198700,5,B000WC38OQ,"As the product description suggests, Iron King is a gloriously loopy Tokusastu Japanese superhero television show. It's filled with furious fast-paced action and campy humor. Brought to you by rhe same team that brought you Ultraman and Super Robot Red Baron, Iron King aired on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 8, 1972 to April 8, 1973, with a total of 26 episodes. It's about Gentaro Shizuka (Shoji Ishibashi), best described as a singing cowboy, and Goro Kirishima(Mitsuo Hamada)to stop The Shiranui clan who've planned to conquer Japan for over 2000 years for banishing them from the country by The Yamato clan. Each member of the S-clan controls a gigantic robot warrior in order to overthrow the Yamato Clan. It's not Gentaro but Goro who has the power to become Iron King by touching the medals on his Turning Hat, and shouting ""Iron Shock!"" when danger comes around. Transforming into Iron King quickly dehydrates Goro and he can only remain as Iron King for a short period of time so this cause problems but it's a good plot point. At the tenth episode, the S-clan is no more but a new group fills that gap called the Phantom Militia. Then, later on- Iron King battles the Titanians who can assume insect-like monster forms.

8222135,4,B000WC38OQ,"More wacky fun from Senkosha studios. Filmed at the same time as RED BARON (1973), this series has a decidedly different flavor. An ancient clan of evil badguys dressed in black with flame insignias and completely absurd football-shaped helmets want to rule Japan. To accomplish their lofty goal, they utilize an army of robots & mutant monsters. Where'd they get 'em? Who knows... it's best not to ponder too deeply in these kinds of shows. The protagonists are a couple of guys, one dressed like an American cowboy and the other like a Swiss Alps mountaineer. They have a female groupy/hanger-on who dresses like Pocahontas, (don't ask) but who isn't all she seems. These folks ARE the show. The cowboy guy does all the human-sized fighting, with the help of his trusty Iron Belt, a flashing penlight thingy that also doubles as a fencing foil, bullwhip & lifeline cannon (again, don't ask). The incompetent mountain climber dude just flails like a sissy and runs around being a doofus during these fights. Yet the oddest thing about IRON KING is that the giant title hero is NOT the rugged fighting guy, as one would expect, but his simple-minded comedy relief companion! The whole thing is very lighthearted and played mostly for fun. There's some drama, but with few exceptions it's nothing too serious.

The villain robots & monsters are all pretty neat looking. The hero is very ULTRASEVEN-ish in appearance. The monster costumes likely used up most of the F/X budget, so the majority of the fighting takes place in the countryside with very few city-based battles. (Miniature landscapes are apparently cheaper to build than miniature cities.) On the downside, the monster/hero fights are energetic but disappointingly brief. I suspect that's due to the low budget nature of the series more than any intent on the part of the show's creative team to skimp on quality. Interestingly, IRON KING is a water-powered cyborg yet nothing much is done in the way of exploiting this weakness, other than giving IRON KING's alter ego Goro an excuse to run around like an idiot acting like he's dying of thirst whenever he transforms back to human size. A unique idea but again the series' small budget hamstrings things. ULTRAMAN had three minutes to win the day whereas poor IRON KING only gets one minute! And IK's reserve water tank must be about the size of a thimble because his warning light starts flashing almost immediately after transforming. Don't worry though, things wrap up nicely at the end of every adventure. Each episode is a whirlwind of silliness that is certain to amuse & entertain the young (and young at heart) for 24 minutes at a time.

Just like BCI's release of RED BARON, the quality of the transfer is strictly average. The source prints are the likely culprit, since the show was filmed in 16mm. Even the most painstaking frame-by-frame restoration can only do so much if the original film elements are tiny and not in pristine condition to begin with. Nothing like that was done here, so what you see is exactly what you get. The video & audio are OK but nothing to rave about. Artificating & pixelation are present throughout the video portion; it's something you just have to live with. Audio is level & solid but unspectacular. A booklet with an in-depth set of liner notes is included which brings you up to speed on the history behind the show, but that's it for bonus features. Also please note: THIS SHOW IS IN JAPANESE LANGUAGE, w/ENGLISH SUBTITLES -  NO DUBBING! YOU HAVE TO ""READ"" THIS SERIES! GOT IT? OKAY? You have been warned. IRON KING is lots of harmless fun, even with its limitations, if you're in a goofy frame of mind. Not my favorite Japanese superhero show by a wide margin but honestly it's just amazing to have a series as obscure as this actually make it over to the U.S. in a legit, subbed Region 1 format. I never would have guessed we'd ever see something like IRON KING over here. That alone makes it worthwhile. 4 STARS.",1422921600,3,3977,4.760869565217392
