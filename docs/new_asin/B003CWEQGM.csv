4111212,3,B003CWEQGM,Overall it was an informational video but it only really talks about home birth and neglects to discuss the possibility of having a natural birth at a hospital or birthing center. Since I am a high risk but still want to do a natural birth this information was not as helpful for me personally and I would have liked some more different information.,1363564800,5,349,4.555555555555555
4111213,1,B003CWEQGM,This video is horrible. It has nothing to do with real stories and is completely one sided. The women in this video are looking at their husbands and don't say a thing. It's ridiculous.,1362614400,,185,4.470588235294118
4111214,4,B003CWEQGM,"It's a short video with stories from several couples and single women from all walks of life. They tell how they came to their decisions and what happened. No real ""new"" information on natural child birth....just a lot of positive reinforcement.",1360454400,,245,5.0
4111215,1,B003CWEQGM,"I was hoping for more of a personal or education film, but instead it was just people talking into a camera. The scene cuts from one person to another very quickly, so the chatter is endless... just a bunch of people jumbled together so quickly my pregnant brain couldn't stand more than five minutes. I got to part two and turned it off... Watching the Business of Being Born now, which is what I should have done in the first place!",1359072000,6,434,4.37037037037037
4111216,5,B003CWEQGM,I really enjoyed this short film. It's only about 20 minutes which is nice because at 37 weeks pregnant I didn't even have to take one pee break! :) I loved hearing such positive feedback of natural birth from medical personnel.  You know if an anesthesiologist and his NP wife chose natural childbirth with a midwife over an epidural and pit there must be something to it!,1355961600,,373,4.567164179104478
4111217,5,B003CWEQGM,"While its true that this film may not be the best for in-depth coverage of childbirth, it's a perfect introduction for friends and family who may not be quite convinced about one's decisions. While The Business of Being Born was helpful for my husband and I, it was a little too negative and hard hitting to show to friends and family who may have made other decisions themselves.  While educating people, I don't want to alienate them.  Orgasmic Childbirth and others are a little too ""out there"" to show to people who are not part of the natural childbirth culture already.

I found this film to have enough information (that midwives come prepared to resuscitate a baby if necessary, that home birth is a safe alternative chosen by intelligent and successful people) without shoving it down anyone's throats.  It is very positive and upbeat about natural childbirth rather than bashing medicalized childbirth.  I would highly recommend this both as an inspiration for those who have made the decision to go with natural childbirth and to show to friends, families, co-workers or others who may want more information about the decision you made.",1334966400,,1147,4.953125

This video has a good selection of people's experiences of natural/home birth, but it is little more than an advertisement for the midwifery service in California who paid to create it. If you are interested in people's experiences, this might be helpful, but it had very little visual interest and almost no actual information about childbirth. I am disappointed and wish I had spent the small amount of money to rent it first.

It explains in detail the types of unnecessary interventions that are mentioned in this film.

I found it helpful because the people interviewed were more, in my opinion, normal moms and dads. They weren't your all natural, organic, hippie-granola crowd. Rather, they were more along the lines of a make-up consultant or an anesthesiologist. Normal women can do this too. :)When we were warming my parents up for a home birth (a new concept to them), this was the video I wanted them to see, to help them understand what we were aiming for.",1272499200,6,612,4.572727272727272

4111235,5,B003CWEQGM,"This was a great overview how educated and just regular couples had such a great experience in giving birth at their home or the birth center.  Here is my summary of the video:

One Mom said, ""you give birth the way you live life, if you live life in your own way, then you might want to have a birth in your own way.""

Introduction of their experiences
Talks about a few different couples experiences with birth at a hospital. They all seemed really enthusiastic about their births. After they seemed as if they were missing something from their birth. They felt like they were treated as a sick person would be with the changing of the clothes and all the monitoring equipment.

The Snowball Effect
The couples talk about there fears when one intervention is started then another one usually has to compensate. One midwife mentioned that may of the protocols are put in place to protect the establishment/hospital and can actually change the labor progression. An anesthesiologist was worried with his wife being pregnant that if she got one then it might lead to a cesarean section. According to their statistics the more monitoring and more epidurals/drugs given the higher the cesarean section rate is. He mentioned that cesections are not as safe as natural or vaginal birth for many reasons: increased infection, mistakes, higher risk of death, morbidity, longer healing rates. For doctors it is easier and lucrative to give a cesarean section.

Birth Specialists
Various midwives talk about what they do as specializing in the normalcy of pregnancy and birth. They work with woman who are low-risk and help them stay low-risk pregnancies. Obstetricians specialize in the pathology and diagnosis and treatment of birthing women. Most of what they see are clients who already have complications. Midwifes help remind woman that their bodies are perfectly designed to have babies and that they are there to help them through this new phase of life.

Things Go Right
These few woman chose to go with a midwife for their next birth experiences. Many of their friends asked them why they would do that because of the question of, ""what if things go wrong?"". There were a lot of things that were said that could go wrong: if baby got stuck in the birth canal, cord wrapped around too tight, and if there was an emergency? The midwifes mentioned that they are usually able to see if a woman needs a cesarean section or transfer to a doctor way ahead of time. With the comparison of doctors showing up during a woman's labor when the head is seen as apposed to the midwife who is with you for the whole labor. The midwifes bring as much equipment with them to the birth as a neonatal ambulance. The husband that was the anesthesiologist asked the midwives about all of their emergency equipment and discovered they would have everything he would have wanted: monitoring equipment, and emergency medications. The midwives are acting like a mini mobile ER and  L&D team.

Birth the Way that You Live
these woman talked about how in their day to day lives they live very holistically. They attend yoga classes, don't go to the doctor for everything, etc. There is a saying that ""you give birth the way that you live.""

Midwives, the Human Epidural
Because this event is a normal occurrence in a woman's life midwifes treat it as such. At home the woman are able to walk around, eat and drink normally, they don't have painful Pitocin for labor, and they get to resting in the tub. At home woman get one on one support from care providers. It was explained that hospitals don't have the amount of staff available to provide this amount of care for each woman and so the main pain management technique is an epidural or pain medications. Midwifes are able to support woman to have more comfortable births. One midwife said, ""there's no epidural that can replace human touch.""

Water Babies
 Many of the clientele that midwives see are because they want to have water births and water labor. In the midwives experience the amount of pain a woman feels is greatly reduced in water labor/birth. One mother said that the water, ""takes away 70% of the pain, plus you are weightless so you don't have the pressure.""

The Birth Plan
 The woman talk about when their labor started and how it felt to them. They talk about driving to the Birth Center or staying at home. Most of them described the feelings as intense. One mom said that her first child was 9 lbs 10 oz and she had a lot of work to do. Another couple was a Cardiologist Doctor for the father and a E.R.Doctor for the Mother, they chose a Birth Center for their birth. They said that ""everyone was focused on Pam [the mother],"" there was no one else doing other things.

Angels Rush In
One woman said that her relationship with with her midwife was more than just a medical one, it was a human relationship. The different woman talked about how at some point during their labor/birth they needed extra support. One woman's labor started slowing down, and another mom felt like she needed to surrender her mind/body to the process. They took from the experience that they could trust their body's process, and trust in their ability. The woman all had their babies in different positions. Each woman felt like their experience was life changing.

Father's Catching the Baby
The midwives really try to help the fathers catch the baby if they want to. Each father had a different experience, but all of them described the amazed feeling of helping the baby come into the world and the joy of delivering their own child. A mother talked about the intimate and intense moments of touching her child for the first time. One woman very blessed to have those wonderful types of memories, because not everyone has them.""

A Good Chance at Life
One mother said that labor/birth was much easier than she expected and that one doesn't have to be ""earth momma"" to do it. The midwives were respectful and helpful and treated each one with such high quality of care. One mother was feeling great an hour after birth she ate a big meal, was social, and she felt alive."" The mothers wanted to ""be there, be in the present, I wanted to know that I could do it,"" they wanted control over what happened to them, and they enjoyed the feeling of being empowered and confident. One Mom said, ""you give birth the way you live life, if you live life in your own way, then you might want to have a birth in your own way.""

These were the professions of all the couples in the movie:

I enjoyed hearing and seeing the birthing couples talk about their positive experiences. It was nice to have so many Doctors interviewed about their positive natural unmedicated births. I was disappointed that there were no videos of their actual births, only a few pictures of them with their newborns. It was an advertizement for the midwives and So. Calf  birthing center. I'm glad I viewed it on line. I would have been angry if I had purchased this video. If you are a practitioner of HypnoBirthing or a Midwife and you have clients that are on the fence about having a natural childbirth, the video still has some value for your clients to view.",1417910400,,771,4.840909090909091

4111245,2,B003CWEQGM,"Before I was 5 minutes in I didn't like this documentary. Most of the interviewed mothers were very condescending with their opinions. I couldn't believe the broad and ridiculously overgeneralized statements they were making. ""A C section is not as safe as having a child vaginally and naturally."" Ok seriously, there are about a thousand different scenarios where a mother needs a C section, and that is the ONLY safe option. I watched this doc because I plan on becoming a mother sooner rather than later and want to understand all my options. This documentary was less about informing and more about scaring women into a natural birth. Another quote, that C-section ""carries a high rate of mortality for mothers and infants."" I mean SERIOUSLY? ""a high rate"" that's not even a number. I want FACTS! I want statistics, not opinions. It ended with a commercial for a specific Birthing Center in CA. I will continue my search to find something that answers the questions I have.",1413244800,,977,4.8562874251497
4111246,1,B003CWEQGM,"These women sound so brainwashed, especially when they are talking about how awful it was when their family expressed concern about the safety of an out of hospital birth. ""I'm not going to accept the fear."" Ok, but then why are you drinking in the fear your midwives are spoon feeding you about doctors and hospitals? This is just an infomercial for home midwives, and it is not an objective video if you have concerns about you baby's life and brain function. But don't babies die at the hospital too? Sure, but not near at the rate they do at home or at birth centers. Check out Colorado or Oregon where midwives are required by law to report how many babies die.",1410825600,,666,4.467213114754099

4111251,5,B003CWEQGM,"This was a very moving portrayal of the experience of natural child birth. I wish more of the science behind the negative affects of medical intervention in childbirth were raised, but overall this was great. I chose natural childbirth for the delivery of my twins before watching this, and was glad to see that there are many other mothers these days that have the same desires for the birth of their children as I did for mine - wanting to be present in the moment, wanting to allow nature to take its course, wanting to NOT be rushed through what is a beautiful natural process because the hospital wants to make more money by delivering more babies....I could go on and on!!!

4111253,1,B003CWEQGM,Informed decisions should be based on a good representation of all the facts.  Many home births have wonderful beautiful outcomes as these stories portrayed but the ones that don't end up at the hospital.  The hospital that the CNM's and their patients repeatedly bash in this documentary.  Hospitals are are there to help and just as many wonderful birth stories come from hospital births.  It is a personal choice and either option is up to the parents. But understanding the risks of home birth should not be minimized as they are in this documentary.,1394582400,,554,4.861702127659575
4111254,5,B003CWEQGM,"My first two children were born in a hospital and my third at home with a midwife.  There is no comparison for a home birth!  Shortly after my home birth I was up, showered and outside admiring my garden which seemed to have bloomed overnight (May birth).  I felt terrific and my son was so much more alert!  Our midwife was so supportive throughout the labor and delivery.  Made me feel so special.  Also I was able to have my other two children present, as well as friends and family. We also had our baby circumcised at home with a Rabbi.  Although we are not Jewish, we were able to locate a Rabbi who agreed to come to our home to perform the circumcision.  He was wonderful! Immediately after the procedure, he handed me the baby and said ""nurse him""!  My baby stopped crying and never showed another second of distress. I recommend this documentary to anyone getting ready to have a baby.",1393977600,,895,4.441717791411043

I felt like this video really reflected that. However, I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't show any births. Ina may Gaskin''s movie child birth is much better. This would be good for the family of someone planning to have a natural birth to see. People are so misinformed about midwives and natural birth. Also liked the Ricki lake documentary on birth.

It was not easy for me but it was, thankfully, doable--My pelvis is quite small & our babies heads were at my limit for being able to deliver vaginally. We wanted to protect our children from the drugs and the effects of such on mother-baby bonding, etc. I enjoyed listening to the thoughts of others leading up to their decision for home birth, and their experiences through their births.

4111261,5,B003CWEQGM,"I read the other reviews and still purchased a copy of the DVD.  It won the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC) Media Award, so I was hoping it wasn't as bad as some reviewers suggested.  As a child birth educator and a mother of four, 3 hospital births and one home birth, I will say that I think this wonderfully represents what it's like to give birth at a birth center or at home. This is a great tool for educating others about midwives and for letting parents who are on the fence about a birth center birth or home birth see others who have done it and what their positive experiences were and also to hear the reservations they had prior to.  I don't think it's fair to say this is just an advertisement.  I know out of hospital birth is on the rise, but it still accounts for less than 1% of all births in the US.  So this dvd/instant video obviously has a certain audience it specifically appeals to.  If you want to see births or get a crash course in child birth education, this is not the film for that.  I think this would be a wonderful video for childbirth educators to keep in a lending library for parents considering out of hospital birth.",1385078400,,1167,4.301369863013699

4111265,1,B003CWEQGM,"This is merely an advertisement. Doesn't present all of the facts.  Could be very misleading/dangerous for some prospective moms who may need life-saving interventions.  While many (most!) moms don't require any interventions and can have a beautiful, safe, and joyful delivery at home, some DO require western medicine to step in!  Some moms who require special medical attention for delivery will know ahead of time; some will not.  Less than 100 years ago, many moms didn't survive childbirth. Now, most do.  Why?  Medical progress. I wholeheartedly agree with the doula who commented earlier.  I am a medical professional in this specialty area.",1379116800,2,649,5.303921568627451

My family and a few friends thought I was crazy for planning a birth center birth, but after they saw this movie, they were way more accepting of it.  It does highlight a specific birth center, but it was nice to see what a standard center looks like- again, just another way to help by family understand my choice.  I liked that it was short (about 20 minutes) because I don't think I could have held the attention of my loved ones much longer :)",1368057600,,562,4.3238095238095235
4111269,5,B003CWEQGM,This is such a great piece about natural birth.  Loved the stories told from so many different types of parents.  It is definitely geared toward clients that the birth center featured might attract but I think it is universal in showing that this type of care can be for anyone.  Definitely going to show my family and friends!,1368057600,,327,4.603448275862069
4111270,2,B003CWEQGM,"My wife and I watched this after viewing ""The Business of Being Born"", also a piece on natural childbirth and midwifery.

While ""The Business of Being Born"" was very informative, with actual history, perspective, and details on the US's massive decline in the accepted practice of midwives and natural childbirth over the last decade, this video did not approach the length, quality, or actual usefulness of ""The Business of Being Born.""  If nothing else, I'm grateful we saw this for free with our Amazon Prime membership; it was little more than an ad for a particular SoCal Birthing Center and, worse yet, it was ADHD theater: sometimes there was music playing in the background that didn't quite fit and the video *constantly* switches from one person/couple to another...  sometimes even before they've finished a sentence.  Very distracting production for what otherwise appears to be a good practice--provided, of course, you're in their area.

This really should be on the practice's website and/or Youtube for free.",1365033600,,1024,5.181818181818182
