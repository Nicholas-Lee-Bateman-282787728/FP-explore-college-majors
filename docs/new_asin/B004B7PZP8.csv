8421574,2,B004B7PZP8,"The program content is terrific and easily worth five stars.  This is really one of the best in Mr. Baer's travelogues.  But the DVD is mastered in letterbox format for old square televisions, which means there is a large black border on all four sides of the image when viewed on today's 16:9 displays.",1486684800,,303,4.592592592592593
