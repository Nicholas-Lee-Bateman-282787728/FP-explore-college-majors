1858471,4,B00008PC10,"Mosquito Squadron, 1968 film

The beginning shows V-1 rockets flying to England. Some are hit by AA guns, some get through to explode. Next we see a flight of Mosquito fighter-bombers flying low into enemy territory. [One Mosquito could carry as many bombs as a B-17.] They bomb the V-1 launching ramps. Enemy fighters attack and shoot one down, the others return to base. One pilot must inform the parents of the lost airman and his widow. [Low level flights do not allow the use of a parachute.] There is another job for this airman - a special photographic assignment. This time their plane is hit and barely makes it back for a landing. That widow arrives to clean out her husband's desk. [Note her hairstyle.] They talk about their past. ""Time is so precious.""

There is a plan for saturation bombing by low-level Mosquitos. Can they train in ten days? Yes, they use a new type of bomb that bounces and can be chucked into a tunnel. One wounded flyer will train pilots on Link trainers. This allows testing the pilots on the ground to gauge efficiency. The enemy has been warned. Enemy fighters attack this airfield. One fighter drops a role of film! It shows RAF prisoners kept at Chalons. ""Chalons must be destroyed!"" Even if it means bombing RAF prisoners! Quint sees Scotty is alive! Later Quint sees a crashed enemy fighter. ""Old wine and young women make a man happy."" Bombing Chalons is an important mission ""no matter the cost"". One officer spills the beans! Is there a way to free the RAF POWs? Nothing must affect this important mission! A French priest arrives to hear confessions from the POWs. ""Go in peace."" The POWs are told of the plan.

After the bouncing bombs are dropped another flight will drop bombs to destroy the Chalons castle where the Nazi research and development is being done. Unless the tunnel is destroyed there will be no attack on the prison walls, the French resistance fighters will withdraw and not attack. Sunday morning is a sunny day. There is a full turnout for church. The Mosquito Squadron changes its course for Chalons. The POWs are ordered to leave the church; they refuse. One officer shoots a submachine gun. German troops fire at the oncoming Mosquitos. One is shot down but the crew is saved. The POWs run free into the woods. A German tank shoots at them. There is action from the bombing and shooting. Back in England they await the return of the rescued POWs. The mission succeeded but the cost was high.

The Mosquito was built mainly from plywood to minimize the need for scarce aluminum. I think it used the same Merlin engine as in the Spitfire. This story combines romance and personal drama to a historic war movie. I read that V-1 rockets could be shot down by a fast fighter (stripped of armor to make them lighter and faster). Some said using a wingtip to nearly touch the wing of a V-1 could make them crash. The much faster V-2 rockets could not be stopped except by bombing or capturing their bases. The V-2 rockets led to the ICBM rockets that threatened the world.",1384560000,,3036,4.616666666666666

The two-engine De Havilland Mosquito played multiple roles for the RAF during WWII.  It was a night fighter and a fast, light-bomber.  In this film a photo recon mission uncovers a Nazi secret weapons development site.  RAF air marshalls order a squadron of Mosquitoes to carry out a precision bombing raid to take it out.  To do this they have to drop a ""bouncing bomb"".  This isn't a joke, these bombs were actually developed to do things like take out hydro-electric dams and do other special jobs.  BTW - the story of the development of this type of bomb and its use against dams is depicted in the fine WWII film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dam-Busters/dp/0982129084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dam Busters</a>.  That film is really worth it.

In this film David McCallum (of TV's ""The Man From Uncle"" fame) leads a cast of RAF pilots tasked to take out the Nazi R&D site.  The Nazis learn of this plan and bring in a large number of RAF POWs to act as a human shield.  The squadron is ordered to move forward anyway.

OK, I am a sucker for WWII movies, especially aerial and naval films, so I went into this one with high hopes.  There is some great footage of these WWII vintage planes being put through their paces.  There is also some vintage footage of the bouncing bomb tests from WWII.  That is all awesome.  Some of the special effects are not that great, but that can be forgiven since this film was made 40 years ago.  What is less forgivable is the painful acting that takes up most of the ground time in the film.  McCallum's main dialog seems to be prolonged stares, and people seem to be able to read his mind?!  The romantic sub-plot is OK, but adds little to the film's overall plot.

All in all this is a movie about great planes and a good mission, but with some really poor acting.  So, to sum up, it was OK, and I don't think I'll be watching it again (unlike a similar era film that I watch a few times a year,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-Britain/dp/B00008PC0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle of Britain</a>).

Told from the British perspective, the primary story line is not too heavy on war (minimal ground combat and bloodshed).  The few brief departures to the secondary story of a romance developing between the squadron leader and his best friend's widow are not distracting.

After information of the planned RAF attack is leaked through the capture of a member of the French Underground, the Nazis move RAF prisoners into Charlon Castle.

1858512,2,B00008PC10,"CONCERNING THE DVD:

Yet another MGM quickie, containing the film in its correct 1.66:1 aspect ratio with some nicely restored video elements.  The footage from other films that was edited in looks poor. The 2.0 Mono soundtrack is in good shape. There are basic subtitles in French and Spanish, scene selections as well as a beat-up trailer.

CONCERNING THE FILM: (from my website, [...])

The always-overrated David McCallum is one of the few good things in this low-budget World War II adventure piece, yet another quickie from Oakmont Films.

Sometime prior to D-Day - probably early '44 or '43 - a Mosquito Squadron is sent to bomb a V-1 rocket installation in France, when Squadron Leader Scott (David Buck) is shot down and presumed dead. His second-in-command, Quint Munroe (who just happens to be like a life-long brother to him) has to return to England and tell his beautiful blonde wife (Suzanne Neve) the sad news. As one would expect, Munroe and Mrs. Scott slowly fall in love. But when Munroe is chosen to lead a mission to bomb a new V-3 development center, things will chance quite a bit - because Scott is a prisoner held at the target fortress!

From start to finish, ""Mosquito Squadron"" is a total hack-job - literally. The story is filled with enough contrivances and clichs to drive any mildly serious critic mad. Let us take a brief look at a 1964 film entitled ""633 Squadron"". In said film, a squadron commander has a best friend shot down over Norway, and falls in love with his sister. Later on, he is assigned to bomb the fortress where his friend is being held. Sound familiar? And that's not all our title film steals! Virtually all of the aerial battle footage is directly lifted from ""633 Squadron"", while the new footage is comprised almost entirely of horrible-looking miniatures hanging from far-too-visible wires.

The writers have also directly copied another classic war film, ""The Dam Busters"". The feasibility of Munroe's mission revolves around a bouncing bomb, which will skip along the ground and roll into an open tunnel leading to the V-3 rockets. (I won't even mention how convenient it was to leave a big open tunnel to drop a bomb into). The real bouncing bomb (made famous in 1954's ""The Dam Busters"") was designed to skip on water to destroy Nazi dams - not the ground as is seen here! The idea of dropping a bouncing bomb on the ground is, simply, ludicrous and impossible. Introduction of this concept kills the storyline immediately.

The low budget shows up in every action sequence: the French resistance force is comprised of a half-dozen men in berets carrying Sten guns, and only a handful of German guards enforce security at the ""fortress"". The forests are obviously cheaply furnished soundstages, and a face-off with an imitation German ""tank"" is ludicrously shot. We never really see much of the German-held Chateau, and when we do it never looks as though we're inside some high-tech development center a la ""Operation Crossbow"". The scenes set in England fare somewhat better, with some excellent scenes set at airfields and a rather rowdy officer's club.

David McCallum and the cast of little-known English actors do a fair job, even though the no-frills script doesn't give them much to do. McCallum is a fair actor, nowhere near as great as his fans hail him to be, though. He was better suited for television than cinema, and that comes out in every scene. He often looks uncomfortable and awkward, but delivers his often banal dialog convincingly and with conviction. His scenes with Neve are often touching, even though audiences have seen this dozens of times before. There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble, besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film ""Diamonds are Forever"" a few years later.

Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s: ""Attack on the Iron Coast"", ""Hell Boats"", ""The Last Escape"" and ""The One Thousand Plane Raid"" among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release, but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here - or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter - is in for a big disappointment. Check out ""633 Squadron"" instead.",1140393600,,4339,4.843454790823212
1858513,3,B00008PC10,"I bought this on the fly (no pun intended)at a local store, then watched it , then ran to Amazon.com to read the reviews.  Yup, it's all been said before.  This is a clone of 633 Squadron, even down to the plane crash and the hook-handed pilot.

The two-pilots-love-same-woman reminded me of Pearl Harbor.

1858514,3,B00008PC10,"This is an entertaining story, but at times a little confused...

Few of the flying sequences are new but any flying sequence involving the Mosquito are never boring.",1110931200,,166,4.928571428571429
1858515,3,B00008PC10,"This movie is not supposed to be a carbon copy of its highly successful predecessor, ""633 Squadron"", yet, to one's horror, one discovers that the opening footage of the V-1 launch, flight and ultimate destruction in a London street, has been lifted straight from ""Operation Crossbow"" - and I only discovered THAT years after watching this movie several times on television.

One can take proverbial potshots (like the Germans at the Mosquito bombers flying at zero feet) at David McCallum for what people have described as his wooden, deadpan portrayal of Squadron Leader Quint Monroe, who appears relatively unemotional when reporting the ""death in action"" of his previous commanding officer, ""Scotty"" (David Buck), to his superior officer.

However, that would be an unfair criticism of McCallum: it would be unrealistic if he were to portray Monroe in a way that suggested that he had to adopt a certain persona just to please the audience (or the studio people) by playing a given stereotype. RAF fighter pilots were, in the eyes of the public, supposed to be suave and debonair, yet, as this film and ""Battle of Britain"" prove, they were ordinary people doing extraordinarily stressful jobs in extraordinary times. Hence, their emotions should reflect the environment of the characters the actors portray.

The most convincing portrayal is that of Charles Gray as the air commodore who tells Monroe to ""chuck a bomb"" in a tunnel next to a commandered French chateau in order to destroy V-3s (as they were referred to) being constructed in an underground chamber. My favourite line in the movie was when Monroe gave his reaction to the difficulty of the mission at the briefing: ""[It's] like spitting into an air commodore's eye from an express train, sir."" People who watched ""Crossbow"" will remember that there was, indeed, a vast studio set resembling such a chamber, yet no such thing is seen in this movie, so, although there was no copying here, it is nevertheless a disappointment.

Having said that, perhaps the budget was somewhat tight, considering that it costs money to have preserved Mosquito bombers (or anything of WWII vintage) flying in movies, and so the cheapest solution for the scene, in which Monroe (McCallum) and Scotty's widow (Suzanne Neve) are in a car, is to have McCallum barely budge the steering wheel while Neve's hair is hardly ruffled while their car is in front of a screen showing a winding road probably filmed from the back of a lorry (one wonders if the camera actually fell off it!).

The most tension-filled scenes are the ones filmed in the chateau grounds where the priest, an intelligence agent, informs the RAF prisoners being used as human shields that Mosquitoes will conduct a bombing raid soon. The prisoners include the supposedly ""dead"" Scott, only Monroe knows he is alive because of a film ""sent"" by Luftwaffe fighters which shoot up the airfield (in this case, RAF Bovington) for good measure. Even so, he has orders to obey: destroy the rockets - even if it means that ""Scotty"" - and a great many fellow comrades - might be killed for real this time around.

Like practically all British war films of the 1960s, one can be sure that there will be certain elements: a romance that doesn't quite work well, a war mission with lots of people being killed, the mission finally succeeding and (with the exception of ""633 Squadron"", perhaps) most, if not all, of the heroes returning home. This film has all these elements, yet it has been knocked - perhaps unfairly - by many people for the so-called ""wooden"" acting. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and watchable, even if it isn't in the same league as ""633 Squadron"" and ""Battle of Britain"".",1107129600,,3698,4.9088

The plot and the acting are extremely good. It will hold your attention to the explosive end. Fascinating subject matter. David McCallum excellently underplays his role.,1076371200,,343,4.7
1858529,2,B00008PC10,"Havent seen the DVD, but seen the movie on TV several times in the 70s, wasn't overly impressed then, so would be less so now.
If youve seen 633 Squadron, then watch this, yes, youve seen most of the aerial action in THAT better movie. This time is a hybrid mission involving rockets or rocket-fuel like '633, but with a potentially thrilling resistance-fighter jailbreak facilitated by the Mosquitoes blowing-down the walls with dambuster-style Upkeep/Highball bouncing-bombs as a bonus target: might seem they are borrowing from here and there of previous movies, but there really was an epic RAF operation against Amiens Prison housing French Resistance fighters during the war, known aptly as Operation Jericho, ( the walls came tumbling down)so its ok to overlap other movies when it also reflects fact, of course.
Anyway, its too low-budgety to do much, saves heaps with using the 633 Squadron sequences, much as movies like 'Midway' used the wonderful combat sequences from 'Tora Tora Tora', and has a melodrama that the dreadful 'Pearl Harbor' probably ripped off, the pilot disappears in combat, certainly KIA, brave late pilots buddy hooks-up late pilots foxy squeeze,they both feel bad about it, but they do it anyway, then dead-hero inconveniently has not been killed, is alive, shaken but not stirred,POW,  but now  pilot  feeling bad about being busy with not-so-dead buddies lady, also has to fly-off and probably off the presumed-dead buddy for real this time himself  as inevitable collateral damage with the Nazi target he has to drop bombs on to win the ruddy war.
If you like 633 Squadron, this is definately inferior but with many melodramatic similiarities,Cliff Robertson in '633 also had to grease one of the friendlies thanks to those horrid Germans,  it lacks 633s stratosperic atmospheric soaring Ron Goodwin theme-music, and really, I wouldnt drop the dough unless you just cant get enough of the admittedly exciting and beautiful Mosquito bomber in any vehicle.",1075852800,,1990,5.167701863354037
1858530,2,B00008PC10,"I loved 633 Squadron so much I decided to give this movie a shot. You can imagine my disappointment when I saw many of the same flying scenes borrowed from 633 squadron. I am a fan of David McCallum but this movie has trouble redeeming itself amongst good war movies.
It is a decent movie but if you are an avid fan of movies like 633 Squadron, Battle of Britain, and Memphis Belle, you probably will be disappointed. I'm afraid after one viewing I donated my DVD to the library.
The DVD quality is good and picture and sound quality are solid. I just wish that MGM had not tried to make the original movie so cheaply and borrowed so much from 633 Squadron and they had added some more well known actors and actresses to make it stand out.",1066262400,,739,4.285714285714286
1858531,2,B00008PC10,"David McCallum, in the initial stages of his long slide down and out after his ""Man From U.N.C.L.E"" stint, stars in this hopelessly cliched WWII flying flick. As ""Quint Munroe"", he watches his Squadron Leader-wingman crash and burn. But wait - that wasn't just his Squadron Leader - it's his sort-of-brother! (Don't ask.) Crushed with guilt and remorse, his duty is to tell the dead pilot's wife. But wait - not only was this his best-friend and sort-of-brother's wife, she was HIS girlfriend first! Next, he must tell the pilot's parents, who are his sort-of-parents. Phew. What emotions all this raise, in everyone EXCEPT McCallum, who must have taken stiff-acting lessons from a fence-post.

Naturally McCallum takes over the squadron, and naturally, they are selected for one of those ""only you can do it"" missions, this time taking out a ""V3 and ""V4"" launch site/plant. Someone had watched ""Dambusters"" once too often, because they decide that the best approach is to use the ""Barnes Wallis"" spinning bomb - on a land target. But wait - in an entirely predictable plot-thickener, a German pilot literally drops a bit of info on them that gives them pause in their plans.

OK, I stand second to NO one in my love of flying movies and Mosquitos are at the very top of my list. (Go read my review of ""633 Squadron"", please.) These just don't hack it, and the ""outside cockpit"" shots are really awful. The plot is tired, the acting is a cypher, and you know, I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. It's nice to see real airplanes instead of CGI (how long, o lord, how long will we be afflicted with THAT gimmick?), but it simply isn't worth it in THIS flick. Watch ""633 Squadron"" or ""Battle of Britain"" or ""Dambusters"" or ""12 O'Clock High"" or......you get the idea.",1055980800,,1769,4.703225806451613
1858532,1,B00008PC10,"This movie was recommended to me on the basis of the special effects with the Mosquito bombers. Don't believe it. The special effects are generally poor to mediocre. Their only saving grace is that the movie itself is so awful that they gain a modicum of respectability by comparison.
Where to begin. The only response I have to much of this film is helpless laughter. As one example, the Germans drop a film canister at the hero's air base. Under normal circumstances, such a thing would be immediately scooped up by British intelligence and whisked off for review. But we are instead expected to believe that it is immediately screened right there, with the squadron leader and the grieving widow's brother (don't ask!) in attendance.
Other details, such as the grieving widow who is permitted to go into the ex-squadron leader's office (and dayroom) to collect his personal effects - apparently she has pretty much free run of the air base. Her pain lasts approximately until she runs into David McCallum there (the replacement squadron leader, who also happens to be the ex-squadron leader's pseudo-brother). An interminable scene of the two of them riding bicycles in the park, but lacking the Burt Bachrach score. Then we have the hero and the grieving widow talking in a convertible while driving around the countryside - no wind noise and their hair does not move! It does not move! And she has BIG hair.
There is one interesting point. I don't know whether or not George Lucas actually saw this film, but the bombing runs over the Nazi chateau and the nature of the target itself seem to strongly prefigure the equivalent bombing runs over the Death Star in Star Wars IV. If so, it would be the only positive effect this movie has produced.
As for the acting, understand that we are not talking Olivier here. David McCallum reprises the emotive range he demonstrated as The Man From UNCLE, and the rest of the cast seems intent on living down to his example.
There are many good WWII aviation movies set in the European theater - ...",1054425600,,2042,4.754929577464789
