8751909,1,B01BXUKT4W,"This is not a review of the product. It is a warning to potential buyers.

The description lists this French Blu-Ray import as an A/B/C All region disk. There is a DVD version included, which is exclusively PAL. That much I understood, but when I tried to play the A/B/C Blu-Ray disk, the Universal logo appeared. So far, so good. It was then followed by an announcement in French about the film (The Sign Of The Pagan). Then the screen went BLACK, and the counter stopped. (No Menu appeared.) I got the same result on two other Blu-Ray players (of recent vintage). Upon examining the back of the box, there was no written mention about A/B/C All Region at all, as I have come to expect from Australian and Spanish All Region Blu-Ray releases. It instead reads PAL. Period. I then Googled the products complete Cover image and it corresponds to the box I was holding in front of me, and to ALL product illustrations on every website offering it for sale.

Question: Does anyone have a different experience with this particular product? Does it play on any Region One player? Or did I simply get a defective disk? Or is this French Import really A/B/C? It definitely is PAL, but thats not how they are advertising it. And none of the sellers are showing the back of the box where the Logo for A/B/C should be. Needless to say I returned the product and got a refund.

The One-Star is not awarded as criticism of the film or the DVD. It is simply that there is no other choice (like No Stars), and I couldn't give 3  or 5 Stars to something I did not get to see.",1506124800,,1560,4.387543252595155

8751911,2,B01BXUKT4W,"Sign of the Pagan tells the story of Attila The Hun (Jack Palance) and his plans for conquest by taking advantage of the split in the Roman Empire. There's a parallel story featuring a Roman centurion (Jeff Chandler) who rises to become Attila's chief adversary after Attila spares his life. It's Palance, however, who steals the show as the conflicted Attila.

At times, I was reminded of Macbeth in Attila's character. He tries his best to interpret and thwart prophesies, but ends up fulfilling them. There's also a reflective quality about Attila that I didn't expect; I had thought of him as a raging beast.

By his own admission, Douglas Sirk wasn't terribly interested in this project and it shows. He did the best he could and, as a result, it's a watchable film.",1472688000,,771,4.746268656716418
