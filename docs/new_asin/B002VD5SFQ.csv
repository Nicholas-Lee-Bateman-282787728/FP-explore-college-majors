3994334,4,B002VD5SFQ,"This film is very fine and well written with Harry Corbett in his prime. An early Ronnie Barker struggles, but is decisively out acted by  Corbett of Steptoe and Son fame.
  The film has an excellent  plot and script and the ""29 pint"" outraged Father of the pregnant daughter is a delight.
  I was pleased and delighted to find to find this 60's period gem and it deserves much more fame and attention,  particularly when compared  with our present and far more superficial current desertland of films. I highly recommend this fine film to all and wish it  far wider fame,  and ladies are quite delicious also.",1393718400,2,610,4.616822429906542
8381899,1,B002VD5SFQ,"A shocking waste of talent. The cast comprises a whole host of comedy names, either legendary at the time of filming or about to become so later. Yet not a smile was raised. The problem is the script, written by two names who were definitely legendary at the time of filming and whose stock rose even further later. Three years earlier, with The Rebel, Galton and Simpson had struggled transferring their formidable talent from radio and television  to the cinema. The Bargee underscores this struggle. Whilst watching it, I had the feeling that it might have been an attempt at a comic me-too of Alfie, with Julia Foster in a (non-coincidental) reprise of playing a sweetheart with an unwanted pregnancy. In fact, the chronology shows that The Bargee pre-dated Alfie. If it served some function in the genesis of Alfie, that would at least give it some saving grace. There's nothing else of merit here.",1516838400,,903,4.825806451612904
8381900,4,B002VD5SFQ,"The movie is dated, simple and charming. The characters are silly but fun to watch. The movie shows the audience a time and place unique to many and an interesting way of life for some. It was interestingly entertaining. I really liked this film.",1471478400,,246,4.613636363636363

8381902,2,B002VD5SFQ,"Charming and beautifully shot on location, Corbett never really gets a chance to let loose and he vanishes for almost a quarter of tge film while we get dropped in what feels like an entirely different story.",1444176000,,208,4.648648648648648
8381903,2,B002VD5SFQ,"A typical 60's British comedy playing on the character of Harry H Corbett who was very popular on British TV in the 60's.
There are a few funny parts but mostly it is overdone especially Eric Sykes as the cabin cruiser captain.
The film was never released theatrically in the US and would not have been succesful over here. I enjoy the nostalgia of old British films but this film is not for everyone.",1438387200,,401,4.4324324324324325
