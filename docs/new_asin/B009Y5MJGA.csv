8545190,3,B009Y5MJGA,"This movie is very well acted, and watching Kim Sun Ah and Kim Joo Hyuk strut their acting powers is always worth a watch.

However, the storyline and editing of this film is very uneven and while watching it, makes the viewer very uncomfortable for all the wrong reasons:  abrupt changes in the story's flow are mishandled to the point that you feel (at least at two points) that you've suddenly switched to a new movie.  Without giving too much away, you go from sports film to comedy to drama and back-and-forth too many times for the movie to ever settle in and become a cohesive storyline.  Top that off with some scenes that probably should have made the cutting room floor, and some scenes that are ""missing"", and you walk away feeling emotionally tangled at an incomplete film, not the story, as the director probably hoped for.

Definitely worth one watch if you are true fan of either Kims, but a total miss if you are looking for a good or even great movie.",1410566400,,968,4.508571428571429
