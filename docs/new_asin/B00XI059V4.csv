8715923,3,B00XI059V4,"Okay, I wanted to give the DVD one star, but Discovery Channel has brought us so much joy, knowledge, and entertainment over the years that it didn't seem fair to slam them just for one mis-step (at least I thought it was a mis-step) so the DVD gets three stars.

This is the DVD that has the Megalodon episode, which I didn't realize was a mockumentary. Two-thirds through the episode it became apparent something wasn't right, but it never occurred to me that Discovery would think to fool their viewers like that. Anyway, I'm very disappointed with that particular episode but the other two discs in the DVD are okay.",1509235200,,620,4.636363636363637

8715926,3,B00XI059V4,"This is primarily Shark Week 2013. If you liked the 2013 season and accidentally erased your recordings, then you will want to get this. If you thought there was too much hype & drama, and not near enough real scientific research (as I did), you won't want this one. Personally, I thought the 2013 season was the worst, but maybe that's just me.",1444176000,4,345,4.492063492063492
