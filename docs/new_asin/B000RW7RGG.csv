8202722,3,B000RW7RGG,"This is a sincere effort but, I feel compelled to say to future buyers, that this is not a beautifully produced, PBS-type of DVD.  It is more along the lines of a home video with voice-over, like Super Saints on EWTN (gratefully, sans Penny's pontifications).  In other words, it's not bad, but not worth twenty-five bucks.  Ten would be reasonable.",1185062400,11,349,4.783333333333333
