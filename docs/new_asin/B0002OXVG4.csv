2112392,1,B0002OXVG4,"Although Warner incorporated some worthwhile elements of the book in this hamfisted attempt at an adaptation, they largely missed the mark. The characters were distorted beyond recognition, and what elements of the actual story that director Mikael Saloman left us with are a weak bandage on the bleeding carcass of Kings supernatural tale of horror. This would be mediocre as a stand-alone series, but as an adaptation it's a complete trainwreck.

The Warner TV adaptation of The Shining had me looking forward to a genuine adaptation of this great book, and instead they produced a septic pile of vampire effluent. The reviewers who claim that this is a faithful adaptation either haven't read the book or didn't understand what they were reading - because this mini series is about as faithful as a drunk politician.

Stop messing with what works! Take the story AS IT IS and adapt it to the screen, or produce it as a separate entity and cut any ties to the great story it corrupted. This isn't worth renting, let alone purchasing.

Stephen King should file a disclaimer. They did his work an injustice.",1096502400,19,1107,4.877659574468085
2112393,1,B0002OXVG4,"You cannot be a fan of Stephen King's classic book, ""'Salem's Lot"", and think that this was a good adaptation.

Apparently this nightmare was supposed to be based on the Stephen King book ""'Salem's Lot"", but after watching it I was left wondering.  It is very clear that there was a concerted effort to ""re-imagine"" and update the original story in order to make it appeal to a new audience, but fans of the book will hate what's been done here.  When I heard that 'Salem's Lot was being made into a mini-series, I was very excited because it's my favorite King book.  Also, recent adaptation have been good (The Shining) or even excellent (The Stand). But oh boy, what a let down it turned out to be. The flow of the movie is disjointed and inconsistent, and there are major deviations from the plot of the book.  Not to mention how boring this thing is.

In case you really want to watch this heap of crap, I won't spoil it for you.  But wait until you get a load of how this things ends!",1096416000,13,990,4.318918918918919
2112394,5,B0002OXVG4,"what gives with all the naysayers? all I hear is praise for the 'nosferatu' Barlow of old-(1970's version)- while I admit that James Mason made an excellent Straker, not much else worked- namely,: BARLOW! what was the deal with reducing him to a silent nosferatu-like ghoul? Sure, Reggie Nalder was effective enough, but that was NOT the Barlow of the book. I mean c'mon- he is supposed to be an ageless, seductivley evil prescence who feeds on the moral weakness and fear of the townspeople-as much so as their blood. A perfect example of this is the key scene between Barlow's confrontation with the priest- the best moment in the book that has finally been done some justice in the new version. Is the new movie perfect? No- but in my opinion, it comes far closer to the original spirit and intent of king's book. Lastly- how can you improve upon the great Rutger Hauer as Barlow???  Nuff' said.",1095120000,15,898,4.647798742138365
2112395,1,B0002OXVG4,"This was not a good adaption of the book, but that's fine, because it was an awful movie as well. I don't want to 'ruin' it by saying what was or wasn't adapted well, but if you're a fan of the book, this adaption misses the point of many of the most significant scenes. Rutger Hauer and Donald Sutherland picked up paychecks for 20 minutes of sub-par work; James Crawford utterly wasted his time; Andre Braugher did a decent job (though his character is so unlike the book, that it is unrecognizable); Rob Lowe mailed it in; the female lead character was so forgettable I don't who played it. The special effects? Great, if it was still 1982. And as for the plot, the movie does have vampires, so it shares that with the book, but that's about it. The movie isn't spooky, scary or dramatic. All in all, a complete failure on every level it aspired to.",1094083200,13,852,4.39873417721519

One of his better proformances I think.  And the movie keeps up with a creepiness throughout the movie of what it could be like for a ""dying"" town of america.

2112397,5,B0002OXVG4,"This was the first Stephen King book that I read back in high school, and along with the Stand and the Shining, it is in my top three of his books.  I love the old mini-series, but this one was very well done and extremely exciting.  Rob Lowe does a great Ben, and the changes they made to the story didn't detract from my enjoyment of it.  It has a lot of tense moments, and I was so riveted that I started to watch it again after the first original broadcast.",1091664000,13,461,4.043956043956044
2112398,1,B0002OXVG4,"I have to compare this to the original movie, there is no way around it. I can't review it on its own merits, simply because it didn't have ANY strong points. I am not biased towards the original, although it is one of my fave horror films.

The new version stinks, totally. The FX are very fake looking, and the story just isn't scary. It had maybe 1 or 2 original scenes but that was it.

It just wasn't scary.

In the original, the Nosferatu like vampire scared me to death. It seems like movies today just don't know how to be creepy..",1091404800,12,539,4.213592233009709
2112399,3,B0002OXVG4,"Salems' Lot is my favorite Stephen King novel, and the 1979 miniseries was excellent. This remake does follow the book more closely in some respects, like bringing other characters to life and showing more of the history of Ben Mears (Lowe). However, the villains Straker (Sutherland)and Barlow (Haugher) aren't seen enough and too many details were either ignored or changed. The 1979 original featuring James Mason(Straker)and David Soul (Mears)seemed scarier and easier to follow. Perhaps the DVD release of this new remake will be easier to hear as well, the TV release was difficult to understand.

One note of Donald Sutherland's portayal of Straker, he was brilliant, should have seen more of him.  The master of course was James Mason, with his sinister voice and sauve appearance, though Sutherland was an excellent choice to carry on this Stephen King classic villain!",1090972800,5,878,5.219858156028369

2112416,1,B0002OXVG4,"SALEM'S LOT with Rob Lowe is the worst remake of the 1979 version
which i still think is the best TV adaption of stephen kings Novel
this 2004 remake was actually filmed in Victoria Australia
which explains why 50% of the Actors are Australian trying to play American roles
there's lots of scenes where you can easily notice 50% american & 50% aussie accents mixed together
when the AUS actors are saying their Lines, it's shockingly bad
i have nothing against Aussies, infact some of my friends are Australians
but when you have foreign actors playing American roles i think it's very insulting & pointless
makes me think that Warners were that desperate to make this production that they got any Actor
to play any of the roles in this very stupid remake of 1979's Salem's Lot
no wonder the ratings were terrible when it was broadcast to TV, i'm not surprised
so this dvd version is worth nothing, worth throwing in the trash
the 1979 version has just been reissued on blu-ray by Warners with
a new 1:33:1 HD transfer & slightly better sound quality which does sound little better then the old Mono sound mix
plus warners have added a new extra, new audio commentary by Director Tobe Hooper
so worth the cash to buy the new blu-ray reissue, scrap this 2004 remake

2112434,4,B0002OXVG4,"There is a very short list of classic novels centering on the vampire mythos. Of course the most famous is ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker (1897); probably the deepest and most philosophical is ""Interview with the Vampire"" by Anne Rice (1976); but the most disturbing may be in fact ""Salem's Lot"" by Stephen King. While Dracula was an ancient monster wreaking havoc on Londoners in late 19th-century Britain, King's tale involves the dark little secrets of a New England town whose residence become ripe fodder for a highly-intelligent demon. The point of King's story I believe is how the unspoken and unexamined behavior of a small town become easy prey to dark forces.

The recent rendition of Salem's Lot into a made-for-cable film starring Rob Lowe, Samantha Mathis, Andre Braugher, Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hower and Dan Byrd is a bit closer adaption to King's original story than the television-movie of the 1970's which starred David Soul and James Mason. Looming above the town is an old ""haunted mansion"", the Marsten House. The House itself is a character like the others, which the more recent adaption exploits a bit further than its 1970's counterpart, although the house is menacing in that adaption as well. In many scenes in this recent adaption, the House looms in the distance, as if watching the events unfold from on-high, a spooky version of the Eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg of Great Gatsby fame.

Rob Lowe in a solid performance in the wake of his years on ""The West Wing"" plays Ben Mears, a native-born of the town Jerusalem's Lot who returns to his place of birth and, as we'll learn, his coming-of-age. Mears has been away from the town for over two decades, nurturing a successful writing career in New York. (Many aspects of Mears ring of Stephen King who was also brought up in a small New England town.) The writer has returned from his hustle and bustle life in the Big Apple to write about the town, and, as it turns out, about incidents which occurred when he was on the verge of adolescents.

Aside from the story of the vampires is the parallel story of the corruption of the town, such as a father abusing his daughter, then threatening the local garbage service who employs a crippled man who he believes had been with this daughter. A lower-middle class couple residing in a trailer park are not caring adequately for their baby, and they use blackmail schemes to raise money. Charlie Rhodes is an abusive school bus driver. He enacts ""justice"" by forcing children he believes are either misbehaving and/or simply doesn't like, to get off his bus and walk home.

When Mears returns to Salem at the beginning, he meets Susan Norton (Samantha Mathis), a college graduate who had been corresponding with Mears through emails about her choice of academic studies. (Which is a bit of an upgrade from the original book and original film adaption. Online selling is also discussed.) Mears learns the Marsten House has been bought by two mysterious gentlemen in the antiques trade, Richard Straker (Donald Sutherland), and the mysterious Mr. Barlow who, according to Straker, is constantly on buying trips in Europe. They open a shop in Salem's Lot.

Brothers Ralphie and Danny Glick, and their friend Mark Petrie (Dan Byrd), decide to see pictures hidden in the glove compartment of their school bus driver who had been abusing them, possibly as a blackmail scheme. The plan fails and the boys end up running for the lives through the woods near the town. Ralphie Glick disappears and Danny Glick is found by Father Callahan on one of the nearby roads. Danny is in hospital and shortly thereafter is paid a visit by Ralphie, the former making the mistake of a letting his ghostly brother pay him a visit. Later, Danny Glick, floating outside the window of Mark, asks to be invited in.

The creation of the vampires spreads like a virus, somewhat akin to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A few characters realize what's happening, including Mears, Dr. Cody, the schoolteacher Matt Burke, and love interest Susan Norton. They realize the evil is emanating from the Marsten House but they must unravel what's happening before it's too late. There is something strange and sinister about their new resident, Richard Straker. A very well-done and satisfying adaption of Stephen King's classic of mortal good versus supernatural evil. This recent version is a bit more faithful to the original book, including the portrayal of Barlow which is closer to King's original vision than the Nosferatu-like character in the 1970's version.",1446422400,3,4548,4.892347600518807

One thing of particular note is I thought the characters reaction to the fact that there might actually be vampire's in the world was quite believable, even more believable than in the original.  I LOVE the original, but I thought the Segway from non-believer to believer (in vampires) was a little sloppy.  I also like the narration.  The main character is a writer so it makes since , but also it gave it that kind of cop film noir feel (Mickey Spellane or Karl Kochack: The Night Stalker feel, which I like very much.  I thought the acting was great and I liked especially the emphasis on small town evil that exist even before the Barlow's of this world come to town, but that ultimately there was more good than bad. A great series that did not get the props it deserved at first due to all the comparisons to the original.  It is in my opinion every bit as good as the original and each of them have their strong points.  If you can watch this unbiased, then you are in for a real treat.
Same can be said for Halloween 3 which is also an excellent movie also, but people could not get over it not having Michael Myers in it.

I thought some of the character choices were a better match than the original (like Mike's character, for instance).

Taken on its own, I tnink it's a nice take on the book, if not completely faithful. I think Donald Sutherland managed to be as creepy if not creepier than James Mason as Straker. I thought the adherence to the novel's depiction of Barlow was nice, even if the character from the original movie was far more frightening. But I also thought some of the side stories and directions weren't necessary.

I liked the casting (Lowe, Sutherland, Hauer and Braugher all do a good job) story, script and performances. Lowe is very good and his narration is good as well. I have many vampire movies and series and this is a solid effort all around and better than your average schlock fair. This Salem's Lot reboot is most definitely worth a look for vampire movie fans. I truly enjoyed and find myself watching it about once a year or so.",1426809600,,601,4.472727272727273
2112454,1,B0002OXVG4,"There was a tremendous amount of potential with all of these good actors in one mini series, it amazed me they still could not get this story right.

 When one has actors such as Ruetger Haur (the best of the best still to this day), Donald Sutherland, and 80's heart throb star Rob Lowe and one still screws it up that is saying something.

 Where did they film this particular mini-series, because I absolutely love the fine State of Maine and that is where the story takes place yet watching this I never once had the feeling that the place had anything to do with Maine at all!

 I was absolutely stunned they blew, in my view Steven King's greatest book to the point it was so bad it was unbelievable.  Ruetger Haur has hardly any real serious time in this mini series at all, and the tone along with the over focus on ""Political Correctness"" throwing in cloches just to show how modern they were really damaged this time honored story.

 Also, I found these particular vampires remarkably easy to kill, just take two pop sickle sticks together and slap it against their faces, wallah they are done!

 The portrayal of the teenage boy character they completely screwed up, at least the teen in the 1979 version had some guts, this kid was a total wuss, ""I know your name!  It's Barlow!!!""  I was saying, ""Okay, who cares?""

 I absolutely hated this side story about these two pieces of trailer trash trying to con this nice doctor character, God they sucked!

 This arch portraying the Priest as this conniving villain, in my view the writers trying to stick it to traditional Catholicism because of modern Political Correctness, was not needed and it just came out terrible.  The 1979 Priest had some guts, and despite questioning and doubting his own abilities to hold his own against the Vampire Lord, he still to me did not come off as a bad guy.

 At least the only thing I will say is that the actress playing Ben Mears's blond girlfriend looked stunning and gorgeous as a vampire, but even that part seemed a little screwy in the end.

 What ever you do if you are a true vampire fan like I am, see the original 1979 version with the actress from the first ""Die Hard"" movie, just skip this monstrosity.",1426550400,2,2214,4.510050251256281

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

Donald Sutherland as Richard Throckett Straker? Really? Straker was a cunning, cold blooded stalker and medium for ""the Mysterious Mr. Barlow"" and Sutherland plays the role  of Straker as if Straker is a pervert child molester. About as bad as his being cast as the ""hippy tank driver"" in ""Kelly's Heroes"".

This is a terrible movie, written for what seems to be malicious and ugly intent. Another piece of garbage which will make any thinking person angry to watch.

Salem's Lot - The Miniseries (2004) is an inferior remake of Salem's Lot (1979), a TV movie that aired in November 1979.  This 2004 thing just totally fails on all levels.  The characters have been changed to the point where they're almost unrecognizable, the characters are unlikeable, the movie is not scary, and I prefer Barlow from the 1979 version - yes, even though he has blue skin and looks like Count Orlock from Nosferatu, he is sooooo cool looking.  Sure, the 1979 miniseries didn't follow Stephen King's novel religiously, a lot of changes were made, but that's fine with me because there's only so much you can cram into 180 minutes and besides that, at least the 1979 version was scary.  This 2004 version isn't scary at all.  Also, I dislike all the modern up to date stuff throughout.  Ironically, all the modern jargon becomes dated a lot quicker in this day and age because technology is advancing so quickly.  Anyway, enough on this lousy movie.

I only recommend watching the original 1979 version.  The '79 version has likeable, well developed characters, and you get to know the characters and can connect with them during the first half of the movie.

2112479,1,B0002OXVG4,"I found this remake of Stephen King's classic novel of vampires coming to a small New England town almost unbearable to watch.  It wasn't because the film evoked the same sense of wonder and dread that the novel did.  Far from it, this was because the ""adaptation"" took obscene liberties with the plot...introducing idiotic new wrinkles to the characters, shifting emphasis from the ones that were lead characters in the book to the bit players, and introducing an ending totally different than the one in the book.  I find myself wondering if Stephen King was happy with the end product (if so, he needs to have his head examined because the the original filming of ""Salem's Lot"" with all its faults was far superior).  Consider:

<spoilers>

1.  Why did they make Matt Burke gay?  And imbue his encounter with the undead Michael Ryerson with homosexual overtones instead of the ones of pure horror that the book had?  I've got no problems with casting Andre Braugher as Burke (Matt in the book was a WASP)...he's a great actor but why throw in an angle like that?

2.  Why did they feel the need to make Father Callahan not just a rather tragic figure whose faith failed him at a crucial moment but instead into a surprise villain who spouts racist insults when he murders Matt Burke (who died of a heart attack in the novel)?

3.  Why did the minseries depict Lawrence Crockett as a man molesting his own daughter?

4.  Why was it necessary to depict Dr. Jimmy Cody as a man carrying on an affair with one of his patients?

5.  Why did the vampires in the miniseries suddenly shift from being vampires to being cannibalistic zombies at the end?

6.  Why was it necessary to change the ending from one where Mark and Ben returned to the Lot determined to eliminate all the vampires to one where Ben and the fallen priest have a confrontation in some city where both of them eventually wind up dead?

<end spoilers>

I just don't get why there was a need to make these and so many other changes.  Some of them don't matter or even make sense since as some people reviewing the series have pointed out, King wrote Salem's Lot in the early 1970s where things like the Internet, cell phones, and al-Qa'ida didn't exist and some updating makes some sense.  But this is more than updating or tweaking a story.  It's a defilement as grotesque as the one in the book where Barlow forces Father Callahan to drink his tainted blood.

It's also not a movie that's true to the details the book.  If that's what you're looking for, you might not like this movie.

I do think that somehow the movie ends up being true, in some way, to the spirit of the book.  The movie is set in a more modern age than the book was.  The characters have changed quite a bit, in several important details.  If that will make you crazy, then you shouldn't watch the movie, either.

Still, the basic sense that I was left with as I watched this movie is that the screenwriter, though he created a world quite a bit different than that of the novel, really loved the book.  As I was watching, I sort of railed against the changes that had befallen the story.  In the end, though, most of them proved themselves to be changes that made sense within the movie's own context.  The thing that I was most upset about (though there were upsets through the course of the movie) was that Father Callahan didn't, in the end, prove his worth.  I suppose I was most upset by that because I knew that later in King's oeuvre (in the Dark Tower books), Callahan appears again, still fighting the good fight, though he had indeed doubted his ability to do so through the years.  So, again, it is the ""official"" canon of Stephen King that makes this movie seem a lesser thing than it otherwise might.

There is a small list other details that didn't work for me, but I think they were mostly details that worked so well in the book, under King's direction.  This was a very early book in King's career, and one in which, to my mind, he proved his mastery.  So, again, this isn't a true rendition of that book.  But it's a pretty good movie in its own right.  Better than the naysayers will allow.

Here's a cool detail:  this is a vampire movie.  But it was nearly two hours into a three hour movie that the word ""vampire"" was mentioned.  In the book, similarly, it was several hundred pages before that word appeared.  When the book came out, of course, vampires hadn't really been heard from in a naturalistic way since Stoker.  Now, they're everywhere.  It's sort of cool that even in 2004, the ""real world"" sensibility was strong enough that we didn't entertain crazy notions until two thirds of a way through a movie.  There is a bit of verisimilitude there.

After watching 2/3 of ''Salem's Lot', I'm not sure I'll even watch 'The Shining.'

The one-star reviews here are spot on. There is no one to even like in the movie. Steven King said himself in last season's 'At the Movies' on TCM that the key to a good horror film was to build sympathy with the characters.

I knew from the opening of Ben diving out the window with Father Callahan that there was probably trouble ahead, but I decided to forge onward.

After making Floyd a total mismatch for Susan, Jimmy a doc who can't keep his pants zipped, Matt Burke a pervert who stared at his male students, Ben a bitter, weird non-fiction writer, Susan an airhead wannabe artist/waitress, Eva as someone who write letters in French as a kid inviting Barlow to America and 'doing unspeakable things' at the Barlow house - and even Mark Petrie as a jerky kid you'd rather not spend five minutes with...top it off with Barlow being totally miscast/misplayed/miswritten and Donald Sutherland's bizarre misinterpretation of Stryker, and you have an entire cast of people you don't like and could care less about.

This was simply horrible. No suspense, very cold, not worth watching. As flawed as the 1979 version was, it's Hamlet compared to this. I didn't even bother with the last third - because who cares?

Im thinking, as im watching the affair part as the doctor is saying he'll have his 10 thousand dollars by the dead mans body you'd assume they have him say it by the boys mother who became a vampire. That would've been a creepy good plot as the mother vampire is waking up she is spilling the doctors lil secret to him and Ben mears and than bites the doctor on the neck. The acting is superb in this movie, but i think they could've found a better man to play the part as the governor of the town in fact i know of several other men who would've given that part more justice and been more convincing. I would've taken out the incest of the governor and his daughter i mean its really unnecessary and takes to much film time showing that when they could've used that extra time to put in other parts of the book involved.
What also doesnt seem right is the zombies. Thats way to overwhelming to add zombies and vampires they should've just kept the vampires only than adding zombies its to overwhelming. Even the man dying in the teachers house was clearly a waste. They should've stuck to that original plot where he is sitting in the rocking chair in the dark as it should've been and shown his eyes gleaming than stops rocking in the chair and slowly opens his eyes and grins at them. Gosh in the original movie when i seen it as a kid that scared me the most had dreams about that for months. Dont take my criticism as being judgemental its just a shame how when you take good vintage movies and drastically change parts of the movie that aren't in the book.

2112500,3,B0002OXVG4,"Let me start off with saying 'Salem's Lot is a GREAT story. If you haven't read the book, do it now. The best aspect of Stephen King is his ability to build characters into people, making them almost tangible, and readers fall in love with them (or hate them, depending on the character).

'Salem's Lot is no different and in the book you get to know everyone and root for certain people, boo for others, and cringe when you read of a select few. Obviously, the director of the movie thought the characters needed tweaking and took it upon himself to do so.

Things that are different(THERE ARE NO SPOILERS): Mark's personality, Susan and Ben's relationship, the plot of Ben's book, the ENTIRE story of the priest, Mark's parents, and, of course, the ending.

The ending of the book (or rather, the on-going ending) was fantastic and while it didn't wrap everything in a pretty bow it was King's ending and the movie ruined that. Now I will say I own both the movie and the book and I can appreciate them separately but in a comparison, the movie doesn't touch King's book.",1339372800,,1073,4.549222797927461

2112502,1,B0002OXVG4,"This adaptation of excellent Stephen King's book is mostly a failure and it is definitely inferior to the 1979 version.

It's a pity, because the casting is rather impressive. Rob Lowe as Ben Mears, Donald Sutherland as Straker, Rutger Hauer as Barlow and James Cromwell as Father Callahan - all are excellent actors, but here their talents are wasted.

So what went wrong? The biggest weakness of the film is the number of differences with the book, some of which change COMPLETELY the personality and the destiny of many important characters. It is always a risky thing to correct works of a great master although it is not exactly forbidden - but, as they say, if you take a shot at the King (sorry, I couldn't resist) you better not miss. Well, here, all the shots missed...

The character of Ben Mears, the main hero, was messed up. Instead of a writer, he is an investigative journalist, who wrote a book about some ugly incidents during war in Afghanistan - and for that reason some ""rednecks"" in Salem's Lot resent him... It ultimately doesn't have any more consequences, but it gives the director the occasion to say ""Hey, did you see it? I am against the war and I said it in my film!""

A more serious difference is in Ben's background, in everything which concerns his relation to the Marsten House - but here I can not say more, except that I found this new thing completely unnecessary.

The character of Matt Burke was changed from white to black, which is finally not so important - but what is already more serious, is that this old teacher was also changed from straight to closeted gay, secretely obsessing on his young pupils... As not such thing figured in King's book, I found this change a really bad idea.

Young Mark Petrie was in the book a very clever and precociously adult young boy, who forced respect by standing up to the schoolyard bullys - in this version he is a kind of a young delinquent and a bully himself!

Susan Norton was a delicious, brilliant, ambitious and educated young girl in the book - here she is already a woman in her 30s, working as a barmaid. Which is more, Samantha Mathis was clearly an error in the casting as she plays with all the talent of a block of timber and she clearly doesn't give two hoots about this role, this film or anything else for that matter. And which is even worse, her character was made in a total idiot!

Donald Sutherland was a great choice to play Straker, the somehow creepy aged antiquarian, but this character was also changed - rather than a distant, arrogant and a little bit scary but always well mannered British gentleman, here he is an extraverted crazy weirdo, wagging his tongue at people and whispering dirty things to the ears of old ladies...

Dr Cody was in the book a young, happy, brilliant, optimistic and generous doctor who still believed that his mission was to save the world rather than enjoy the life and get rich - here he is a moron who can not keep it in his pants and sleeps with his patients...

Lawrence Crockett was in the book a weasely but very clever real estate agent, who made a fortune out of nothing, who was feared but also respected in the town and also a rather good husband and a doting father, spoiling silly his only child - here he is a slimy creep and a pedophile, who regularly rapes his daughter...

But the WORSE thing was made to Father Callahan, who is such a complex, tragic and important character not only in ""Salem's Lot"" but also in some of the much later Stephen King's books belonging to the ""Dark Tower"" cycle. I can not really get into details to avoid spoilers, but the changes made in this version completely RUINED this whole character. My only guess is that the director simply couldn't resist the pleasure of some Catholic bashing, which seems to be presently the last still respectable form of bigotry...

And finally, there is one more change, concerning the city of Salem's Lot as a whole. In the book, Stephen King described the life in a little provincial town with realism, digging without mercy into some of the dirty little (and not so little) secrets, but as a whole his vision was one of comprehension, teinted with some humour. In this adaptation, Ben Mears who is the narrator, describes the town and its inhabitants with deep contempt and in some moments with real hatred. And in fact towards the end it seems that Salem's Lot was not the victim of an evil monster but was simply punished for the deadly and ugly sin of being a small town populated by simple people who just wanted to live their lives and be left in peace... This contempt towards Salem's Lot inhabitants (absent from the book), which appears in the fullest in the scene when a group of ""vampirised"" townspeople gather in the dump and eat garbage, completely changes the whole sense of the story.

And finally, there is the ending which is COMPLETELY different from the one in the book and which is probably one of the most ludicrous things I ever saw on TV...

For all those reasons, I personally found this adaptation very, very disappointing and I advise against buying it. It is more reasonable to rent it or even look it up on ""you.tube"", because otherwise it would be a waste of money and shelf space.",1337644800,8,5234,4.548352816153029

Many of Stephen King's novels focus heavily on character development, and in ""Salem's Lot,"" one of his earlier novels, this is no different.  In this film adaptation, characters are at the forefront, even at the expense of plot development, which can be slow at times.  Small town living is portrayed beautifully here, shedding light on the very important idea that the relationships built between residents of small towns can be both rewarding and perilous.  I prefer this film over the older one, because it remains truer to the novel and gives evil a more realistic and human face.

2112515,4,B0002OXVG4,"SALEM'S LOT

I happen to like this updated mini series from the King classic which was also adapted much earlier into a mini series with Tobe Hooper at the helm. This version is not that movie and is not exactly like the book either but I must say that I found it really entertaining. From the acting to the over all story this just seemed like a good time to me, those around me agreed. Even though it is not completely faithful to the original work it is still worthy enough that King put his name on it, there have been others he hated enough to not have his named attached no more.

The story is the same about a writer coming back to his hometown and an unspeakable evil is lying in wait. Of course you all know that the evil in which I speak is vampires with Barlow [Rutger Hauer] of course as the lead heel in this. As the small town slowly starts to die around poor Ben Mears [Rob Lowe] who is still traumatized to an incident as a youth he starts to realize something is going on. People are disappearing and others are acting a bit strange and this all coincides with the arrival of Mears and the never seen around town Kurt Barlow. Barlow's assistant Richard Straker [Donald Sutherland] is out and about running an antique store, he is an odd fellow. But when it all comes down to it there are some vampires running around and a select few have to step up and take them down. Those few are probably the most unique and diverse group of hunters ever but hey it makes for a good time. There is the returning home writer who witnessed a murder/suicide as a child in Mears, the doctor who is sleeping with a patient and also being set up by her in Dr. James Cody [Robert Mammone], the priest who may be more gone then he appears in Father Donald Callahan [James Cromwell], a school teacher who likes the fellas in Matt Burke [Andre Braugher],  and of course a kid named Mark Petrie [Daniel Byrd] who has more lives than a cat.

That group comes together to stop this evil virus that has invaded the town and they may or may not be successful. Director Mikael Salomon keeps things moving and makes the film look very atmospheric but at times the film seems uneven. Sometimes one thing will be going on and the next we switch gears, some films do that intentionally but I doubt this film was supposed to do that. Still it is an enjoyable film and writer Peter Filardi did a decent enough job up dating this film into today's world. The film looks good and there are actually some pretty good moments in this version of the King classic.

As far as performances go I think every one was up to par and delivered well, no weak performances as least from what I could see. Rob Lowe as always been a favorite of mine and did a good job in this film in the lead role. Rutger Hauer was good as the evil lead vampire named Barlow and pulled of the role well, as did his side kick played by the great Donald Sutherland. As for the rest of the hunters that accompanied Rob in this film they all did great jobs. Robert Mammone was excellent as Dr. Cody and was one of my favorites in the film and James Cromwell was equally as good as the disgruntled priest. Andre Braugher was great in his role bringing something very new to the character and of course the surprise of the film Daniel Byrd was good in this as well, in fact his character may be the best and most fearless of the hunters.

Every one else in this film was great as well with like I said no one giving a bad performance at all. If you did not catch this one TV or even if you did I recommend this one to every one, it's good for a lazy Friday night or Saturday. To all King fans out there this may be a disappointment to you if you don't give it a chance, just know that this is an up date for our time we live in now with cell phones and all that stuff.

2112516,5,B0002OXVG4,"You one starers on Salem's Lot Tv miniseries should be ashamed of the one - star views.
The reason for why is because this is simply a miniseries version designed to capture the spirit of the modern times and put it into context aligning with Stephen King's Salem's Lot.
And doing that is not as easy as you think. I watched this film for over 3 or 4 times and know what I'm talking about - I find absolutely nothing wrong with it. Maybe 10 years from now there'll be need to remake Salem's Lot but until then at least let's give this series a chance.
When I say you should feel ashamed I do not mean I am attacking you personally - what I mean is that this TV series is simply brilliant and those of us who know are all in agreement on that.
This TV series is in fact a whole movie that's on a single DVD and it's an awsome film. It'also a return to the vampire who couldn't tolerate crosses in the cinema of the 50's , 60's and 70's , 40's , 30's and even 20's.
If you're gonna remake a film like for instance Vamphyr , I wouldn't be surprised to look at disappointments. But I won't even give myself time to view the reviews of the one starers. By that I don't mean they don't know what they're talking about - all I mean is that those are their views , and my view is my view. And when I state that my view is that the majority of them should feel ashamed , they'll at least try to put themselves into the shoes of the geniuses behind the production of the series. At first I wasn't sure if I was gonna like the TV series or movie or not , but the 180 minutes made me feel as if I had been watching it for shorter time than the old film.
And it's a different atmosphere now , literally when it comes to old movies. Look at how different the atmosphere is then and compare it to what it's like in films that are being produced today. The sky tells us a lot in these films. The vampires are sinister and old - modern. I think that there may be fans of this movie in even the communities of real life vampires. After I watched the film I bought a new version of Salem's Lot which I still keep at home. And I say bravo! This movie is an absolute masterwork in movie remaking. This is a brilliant example in a sucession to remaking and I hope that my comment will not inspire the producers to create worse remakes of other movie projects in the future.
Sometimes when too many people give a movie director's film project similarly sounding positive criticism reviews , the result may be that a future film project becomes not as sucessful because the director was not as serious when he had been focused on that film. So maybe a lot of negative criticism spiced with a few positive ones didn't do any damage.
This series is also in my view far less formula - based than the old Salem's Lot which is equally brilliantly directed. But what the negative reviewers and we positive reviewers on Salem's Lot TV series or film can agree upon , is that the good ol's Salem's Lot will never be remade in the fashion it originally appeared when it was first released in cinemas.
This is a series or film I keep reliving and enjoying each time I watch it.
I strongly encourage newcomers to the world of Salem's Lot and the world of these two films not to take my positive criticism seriously but to form their own judgement after they've seen these films and compared them with each other. There was also a relatively unknown Salem's Lot TV miniseries released before this one was made , and then there was a Salem's Lot 2 which was supposed to be a sequel to the original Salem's Lot , and incredibly I've actually seen Salem's Lot 2!!",1237161600,,3624,4.208333333333333

Put the original out of your mind.  Let the re-make stand on its own.  Does it compare to the book?  Forget that too.  King's books are very visual.  If you have read a book of his it is like watching a movie.  Several movies based on his books have not done well because, I suspect, the reader has too strong of a mental image of what the movie should look like.  Judge this on its own merits, which are considerable.
Lowe gives a solid performance as Ben.  His voice over, though not King's words, is good and gives a nice feel to the film.  The sets are superior to the old version and add to the growing creepiness of a twon being take over by evil.  They also do a really good job of making the house an evil character.

(even Rob Lowe who I've never been a big fan of is both smart and moving)  Plus who else could you want as Barlowe than Rudger Haugher?  The supporting cast has their moments as well (also their doozies too, I'll admit) but mostly everyone stands up with the big boys or at least remains solid.

I also enjoyed the writing.  Rob Lowe's narration established the mood well and seemed to have been taken right out the book - which I always appreciate.  The television adaptation was modern, much to the horror of many reviewers here.  I personally I thought making Andre Braugher's character homosexual worked.  Nor did I mind their making Ben Mears former Iraqi war journalist - it brought the timeless tale into the here and now, and tied in well to his character arc.

I have to say I also enjoyed the music.  Lisa Garard's vocals haven't sounded this good on a soundtrack since Gladiator and the producers milked it for all it was worth.

This might not be Hamlet but it's as good a Stephen King treatment as you'll find anywhere, especially among the tv mini-series which usually suffer from weak performances or lack of any real swagger.

2112523,4,B0002OXVG4,"This recent (2004) TV film is adapted from Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot. This adaptation had been waited for and expected by many years since the first old adaptation and especially the scandalous second episode that had transformed Jerusalem's Lot into a blood farm for a community of vampires. This adaptation is very faithful to the novel though it adds a different end in concentrating the hatred against vampires onto the probably catholic priest who had been obliged to drink some of the vampire's blood, going as far as making the main character trace him in New York and kill him, though in a traditional way, which makes us doubt he will die. The second element in this film is the great dynamism, the upgrading and updating of the world that has cell phones and other modern technology. This gives to the film a modern look and feel and that is good and bracing. The characters are also speaking today's language and behaving in today's fashion. The film has also gotten rid of some of the gross surreal if not supernatural elements in the very looks of the two culprits, the vampire and his ghoul. They look so much more human than in previous adaptations. But I remain doubtful about the message of the film, or of the novel. The vampire is in no way regenerated and the myth is taken in exactly the same terms as it had always been taken, or nearly, up to Anne Rice's rewriting of it. I think this vision is making the audience get used to the necessity to kill and destroy the foreigner because he is the very image of evil, even if he does not look evil at all. This adaptation also has the merit of lightening the sentimental side of things, the various love affairs and the innuendo about such possible sexual perspectives. Everything is better concentrated on the vampire and his action and conquest of the town.

If they were to be identical, what would be the point of doing it again? So just watch it and enjoy it for itself. I really liked all the characters in the movie and they felt real, even more so than the original. I believe that Rob Lowe did a good job. Samantha Mathis played her part very well. Robert Mammone, Dan Byrd, Andre Braugher as well as many others, all did an excellent job playing their characters. I liked the mini series when I saw it on tv and that is why I purchased the DVD. I really liked how some of the vampires carried over their personalities and even feelings after they were made into vampires. Cool movie. If you like vampire movies, you will like this one.",1193443200,2,815,4.298701298701299
2112525,5,B0002OXVG4,"This is the movie that the original should have been. It is superior in every way including the cast, the acting, the screenplay, the score, the character development, and the cinematography. The original pales by comparison. The mini-series is also more true to the book; this is not necessary a good thing when it comes to adapting Stephen King's novels to the screen, but in this case it is.

This is a modern-day adaptation that works. In his books SK takes myths and legends and adapts them to our times. If SK had written this book in 2004, his characters would have been using cellphones and the internet. So why shouldn't they here?

Who cares if we don't see Ben Mears at his typewriter? Like all SK books this is a long story and the producers had to pick what to include and what not to. Otherwise, this movie would have been criticised for being bloated, boring, and too long. They chose well. I have watched this movie at least 20 times and I am still seeing new things.

All of the characters in this film are more believable than those in the original. David Soul just wasn't convincing. I couldn't buy that he cared about the Marsten House. Not so with Rob Lowe. Rob Lowe's narration from his hospital bed, with flashbacks to him there, works well. ""Hail Mary full of grace, help me win this stock car race..."" Rob Lowe's Ben Mears is sympathetic.

Where were Dud Rodgers and Ruth Crocket, the school bus driver, or Sandy and Royce McDougall and their baby in the original? These are high-profile characters in the book that were important to the story yet were completely omitted in the 1979 version.

In addition to being better-developed, nearly all of the characters in the mini-series are more likeable and dignified. The boarding house woman in the original looks like a barfly and the sheriff comes across as a dumb country bumpkin. The teacher in the original was just a frail old man with gray hair who had little to offer.

This film's Barlow is also better, much more convincing than that 10-foot tall space alien thing in the original which was laughable.

This movie has some truly macabre and scary moments. The vampire that slithered through a narrow vent to reach his victim, breaking his bones in the process. The creatures who climbed walls and crawled upside-down on ceilings. Ben Mears' encounter with Susan at the end of the movie--this last part was left out entirely from the original except for a split second when David Soul turned to the house before setting it on fire and said, ""Sorry Susan."" That can't compare to the encounter between this Ben Mears and Susan Norton at the end of this movie--it is beautiful and heartbreaking. Dud Rodgers' isolation and destitution in the junkyard at night, making him vulnerable to the monster. Matt Burke's reaction when he walks into his upstairs room and sees Mike Ryerson standing in front of him--the acting is brilliant, I have never seen shock and horror conveyed so well by any actor. Ben Mears' confrontation with Barlow at the end when Barlow taunts him and Ben drives the stake through Barlow, destroying both the monster as well as the vampire within himself.

My only criticism of the movie is at the very end when it looks like Michael Jackson's Thriller video with the monster mob shuffling through the streets. That scene should have been left out, but that is a minor thing.

This is not the best horror movie I have ever seen and it may not even be the best SK mini-series that has ever been made, but it comes close. The original was not a bad movie, but it cannot hold a candle to this one.",1183593600,2,3592,4.626373626373627
2112526,5,B0002OXVG4,"Most of the critics here compare this mini-series to the first movie adaption of 1979 and not to the book. And I guess most of them knew the 1979 version before they read the book (if they read it at all), and they did it as boys or girls, being scared and thrilled and loving it ever since. If it was the other way round - reading the book first and then watching the two movies (without the fond memories of thirty years inbetween) - the contest wouldn't even be close: This is by far the more faithful adaption of the original story.

Most critics keep coming up with totally irrelevant details: So Straker isn't bold anymore. Who cares? So Matt Burke is an African American and gay. What's the problem there? I find it pretty annoying that most of the detractors here are complaining about this. It's the 21st century, for christ's sake! True, King didn't put any minorities in the book, but this was the 70s, and I'm quite sure he would today.

King had a whole book to develop characters and relationships. This movie only has three hours. So to speed up character development they gave them  back stories that weren't originally there: Ben was in Afghanistan, Burke is gay, the doctor had a crush on Sandy, etc. etc. It is all in sinc with the feel of the mood of the original story. This is movie making 101, actually.

And then Barlow. What an improvement on the first version! I mean, James Mason was a fine Straker in 1979, and Donald Sutherland is slightly overacting here. But coming from the book's Barlow I was sorely disappointed to find that Tobe Hooper had turned him into a blue skinned caricature of Max Schreck. Here we have Rutger Hauer - who was born to play King's seductive and charming villain. Again, the choice isn't even close.

So, if you don't mind having black and gay characters in your story and if you love the book, especially its non-horror aspects, this is the movie for you. Of course, you can always turn to a wooden 70s monster flick, if you like. But don't pretend it has anything to do with Stephen King.",1182384000,6,2047,4.477211796246649

Barlow is a jolk in this film compared to the amazing Barlow from the Tobe Hooper film, plus the Toby Hooper Salem's Lot is so much more scarier and has so many more horror elements contained within it, even the skull in the moon at the end with the burning house is so spooky.  This film however did have good parts to it and was explained in more detail but it is not nearly as spooky as it should have been, too much explaining and not enough development. Over all 3/10 worth watching but not nearly as amazing as the origional which is a 10/10 spook fest.",1178841600,,613,4.230769230769231

The bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea. In this adaptation, Ben Mears was the kid who found the bodies of Hubie Marsten and his wife. The story begins in winter instead of late summer. Ralphie Glick doesn't just go missing, he's drowned in an icey pond. Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm.

2112529,3,B0002OXVG4,"I remember trying to watch the newer television version of Salem's Lot when it was first on TNT a few years ago, but it just didn't grab me at the time.  I hate watching a mini-series on television that has a ton of commercials.  Also, the little bit that I saw of the show didn't appear to be any more chilling or scary than the original version had been.  For some strange reason, television and Stephen King simply don't mix very well.  Almost everything by King that's been done for television has turned out to be rather mediocre at best.  Some of it has been downright awful.  That's not to say that I don't own the DVDs of The Stand and The Shining and Nightmares & Dreamscapes.  I do.  It's just that I seldom watch them, except for maybe ""Battleground"" in the Nightmares & Dreamscapes series.  That was an EXCELLENT adaptation of a Stephen King story.  The best that's ever been done for television.  I wish the rest of King's stuff that's been done for television was just as good as ""Battleground,"" but it isn't.  Which brings me back to Salem's Lot.  I found a good price on the DVD and decided to give the movie another chance, but without the commercials.  I'm glad I did.  Though the mini-series still had its share of problems, I certainly enjoyed it more this time around.  Rob Lowe takes over the role of Ben Mears from David Soul, playing a writer who returns to his small hometown to write a book about evil and ends up having to fight it tooth and nail.  Rutger Hauer plays the vampire, Barlow, and Donald Sutherland plays his assistant, Straker.  Both of them take over the evil Marsten House that overlooks the town of Jerusalem's Lot, and it isn't long before people start disappearing.  Andre Braugher and Samantha Mathis play Ben's friends and accomplices in fighting the vampires.  James Cromwell plays Father Callahan, the priest who lacks the faith to destroy the evil that's taking over his town.  It's been so long since I read the novel that I unable to tell just how well the newer television version actually holds up.  I will say that it's difficult to find someone to root for.  None of the characters appear to be very likable.  Still, the special effects are well done, and both Sutherland and Hauer steal the show with their over the top performances.  It's easy to see that both men were enjoying themselves and hamming it up to a certain degree.  Rob Lowe does a good job with his character, but David Soul was infinitely a more likable actor in the original series.  I liked it that one of the search dogs in the movie was named Cujo, though he wasn't a St. Bernard.  The movie runs three hours in length, and the last third is by far the best part, though there is one scene in the middle where a vampire in a jail cell squeezes into a tiny air vent in an attempt to get to Lowe, who's in a cell that's further down the corridor.  That was a cool effect!  While not a 5-star film, Salem's Lot is definitely not a 1-star movie, either.  I am happy that I now have it for my ""Stephen King"" film library.  Last, the DVD doesn't have any extras on it.  It would've been nice if there had been an interview with Stephen King and maybe some of the cast and crew, explaining why Salem's Lot was being remade and what they hoped to accomplish with the newer version.  No such luck.  It's like everyone took the money and ran!!!",1174521600,3,3362,4.4290375203915175

2112531,4,B0002OXVG4,"This is not at all a bad movie.  Ben Mears is a likable protagonist, who I found myself rooting for all the way along.  The supporting characters are also cast well, and that is important as this movie depends a lot on them.  Unlike many of todays movies and books, this story does not only focus on the protagonist, it also follows the lives (and deaths) of the lesser characters.  We come to know their struggles, how they feel about certain things, and their relationships.

The vampires in this movie are clearly no Lestat's.  They are monsters, who are simply out for blood.  There is no romantic quality to them, and they appear to look more like zombies at certain points than vampires, which works for the movie.

Now, onto the complaints.  The characters should have been more freaked out!  There wasn't much reluctance in certain characters to believe that vampires were taking over the town, and even less reluctance to rely on the legendary means of killing a vampire.  And, there is also one big hole in the plot.  This movie clearly follows the legend that vampires cannot enter a home unless invited--that actually plays a MAJOR part in the movie.  However, in one scene, Barlow (a vampire) breaks into a woman's house through the window and kills her!  I do not know if this happens in the book, and if there is an explanation, but the movie surely offers no explanation.  Other than the aforementioned, the movie isn't bad.

2112532,2,B0002OXVG4,"Well, the film looks professional enough.  It doesn't have low-budget TV movie written all over it.  Also, it does a good job of balancing all the multiple storylines, and weaving a large and diverse cast of townspeople into a coherent plot.  It's well acted, mostly.  I could bitch about Rob Lowe, but I think that would just be mean-spirited scapegoating.  Rob Lowe is fine.

But is everything is so well done, why is the film so very boring?  Why don't I LIKE anybody?  Why is watching people die like ticking items off a ""To Do"" list?

The film opens with Ben Mears (Rob Lowe), trying to murder a priest, Father Callahan (James Cromwell), in a Detroit food kitchen.  Both end up in an emergency room, where an intern decides to practice his bedside manner on the critically injured Benjamin.  ""Why, as a good Christian shouldn't I let you die?"" jeers this charming fellow.  Mears replies with two words.  ""Jerusalem's Lot"".  Cue to flashback.

Ben Mears is a famous author who moves back to his small town home of `Salem's Lot to write a book.  He wants to rent the ""cursed"" Marsten House, but fellow newcomer Mr. Straker (Donald Sutherland) and his Mysterious Unseen Partner snatch it out from under him.  Further misfortunes await Ben, as he is then romantically pursued by one Susan Norton (Samantha Mathis), who has lovely eyes and cheekbones, and a personality cobbled together out of the rejected spare parts of other substandard horror heroines.  Let me give you an idea about Sue. When told in confidence that Ben is writing about the haunted house, she ""accidentally"" lets it slip.  But when she realizes his REAL theme is ""small town evil"", she gets all offended and rats him out ON PURPOSE, turning the whole town against him.  Desperate for further abuse, Ben also befriends his in-your-face ex English teacher Matt (Andre Braugher), who lectures him on his cynicism, and tells him how awful his writing is.

Fortunately Ben sticks around anyway, because before you know it, kids start to go missing, people start dying of ""pernicious anemia"", and Ben suspects the House and its new occupants have something to do with it.  Which, of course, it does.  We can tell because every time anyone goes there, the camera starts sneaking up on them for no good reason, and the soundtrack makes lots of whooshing and chanting noises.  This is not scary, but it does explain why the place was so hard to rent.

This film has Something to Say.  To do so, it draws Metaphors between human corruption and supernatural evil, and points out these Metaphors in excruciating voice-overs and forced dialogue, just to be sure we catch on.  To further this Important Metaphor, it seems EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the whole town has to be corrupt.  The ""bachelor"" schoolteacher has a secret life in Portland.  The priest drinks.  The doctor is a self-indulgent materialist who is having an affair with an slutty teenager whose husband is a child-abusing blackmailer.  The crooked real-estate agent molests his daughter.  Mark Petrie is a delinquent, Mrs. Glick is a snob, and Ben's landlady used to dabble in black magic and sexual perversion.  I could go on.

There is some good stuff in this movie, when it relaxes and remembers it's a VAMPIRE FLICK.  I liked the cop's understated horror at a certain revelation.  I liked the way half the characters proceed on the assumption that there are vampires without truly believing in them, while others who don't consciously believe in vampires at all behave as though they did.  When one of the few likeable characters turns into a violent jerk who covers up obsessively in the daylight, we get a brief touch of the pathos and creepiness which is otherwise missing from this version.

But mostly, the film lacks life.  Humanity and warmth seem conspicuously - even intentionally - lacking.  The changes to the framing device, and to Father Callahan, are particularly glaring examples of a general attempt to leech human decency and affection from the story in favor of misanthropic bleakness.  One thing the first miniseries managed to do was make me empathize with Mears before I knew anything about him, simply by allowing me to vicariously experience his fascination and his fear.  But here the film stands in judgment of the characters and the town, while at the same time judging the hero for being judgmental.  This makes it hard to empathize with anyone.

There is one scary moment in the whole movie.  ONE.  And it does not involve vampires.  Any vampire that shows up, the first thing he does is move around at super-speed, just to show that he can, which immediately kills the mood.

Regarding the spiritual themes of the story: The premise from Stephen King's novel is that vampirism arises from Real Evil.  This implies that there is such a thing as Real Good, which is why crosses work.  In the 1979 movie, the heroes' mad scramble for crucifixes and rosary beads, even though nobody seemed to be Catholic, was funny and kind of endearing.  And it saved the movie from any implication of preaching or pretentiousness.  Alas, this remake is nothing if not pretentious.  If the screenwriter can possibly contrive it, showdowns with vampires are also showdowns with One's Own Sins.  Gay teacher Matt Burke rejects the sexual overtures of the vampire youth he once lusted after, driving him off with prayer alone.  The materialistic doctor sacrifices his BMW to save a child.  As for poor Ben Mears, his sins and psychology take up half the script.  Neither the living nor the dead can shut up about them.  ""I know where you're going with this"" Mears complains, when the vampire he's about to stake regales him with a litany of his faults.  Sure enough, the vamp asserts that since Mears uses other people as fodder for his writing, this makes him . . . the real vampire.  But Mears is too smart to fall for this.  ""I'm NOT the vampire,"" he retorts.  ""Not ANYMORE!""  Oh, please!

The same vamp also gives Father Callahan some incoherent psychoanalysis involving his faith and his drinking problem.  Which just goes to prove that Callahan's remarks from earlier in the film were incorrect.  Sure vampires are proven to be a Real Evil rather than figments of our Repressed Subconscious, but it doesn't change anything.  Freud is NOT dead, and he still gets to spoil all the fun.",1158796800,14,6322,4.803339517625232
2112533,1,B0002OXVG4,"Rob Lowe is mildly okay as Ben Mears, but his performance goes nowhere near David Soul's angst ridden, really convincing portrayal from the 1979 original. Donald Suterland is disappointing, and I don't think it needs to be said that his performance is less than spectacular, even absurd. He's no James Mason.

Rutger Hauer gives a better performance than this series deserved. His portrayal of King's Barlow is more accurate than the Nosferatuesque Reggie Nalder, but somehow this seems to work to the film's detriment rather than benefit. Rent the original film, or miniseries. I had high expectations, maybe that they'd build on the original a little, but it's just rushed, badly acted, trying too hard to be modern, and in general, a waste of time.",1156723200,38,751,5.008
2112534,5,B0002OXVG4,"I was skeptical at first, especially after reading some of the pans on the Amazon website. However, after the first viewing SALEM'S LOT emerges as one of the best King adaptions. Director Salomon was a cinematographer first and this shows: breathtaking visual compositions put you in the right mood from the start, and the whole film is elegantly mounted - a feast for the eyes. But Salomon surprises also with gripping, layered chracterizations: he draws great performances from his actors who are uniformly wonderful.

Some people criticize the changes that were made, for example Ben Mear's background. Yet, all of them serve a purpose in making the story richer and more contemporary without distracting from the original storyline. Some people on this website just didn't try to think about the changes - they just complained that they were made.

There is absolutely no tension, no dramatic build up, and certainly no frightening climax.  In fact, I'm not exagerrating here when I say there are no frightening moments whatsoever.

There is a lazy reliance on stupid special effects which apparently are supposed to make up for the lack of suspense, the shallow characters and the plodding pace.  Rob Lowe is...not good.  His narration makes you want to reach for your mute button.  And one little thing that bugged me throughout the entire series was the fact that Lowe continually calls the town ""Jerusalem's Lot.""  I know, that's the actual name of the place, but the damn show is called ""Salem's Lot,"" so call it Salem's Lot.

Many of the scenes are unintentionally hilarious.  A vampire shows up at the house of his former gay teacher and tries to get some lovin.'  My favorite is when Rob Lowe is inexplicably locked up in a jail cell.  The guy in the next cell is a vampire and proceeds to squeeze himself into a human accordian to fit into the vent.  He breaks every bone in his body just so he can ooze over to Rob's cell.  After all that trouble, Rob won't even open the ventilation shaft to let the little dude in.  How rude!

I understand why one of the book-events got edited out.  If the writers had let writer Ben Mears informally adopt orphan Mark Petrie after the denouement, as in the book, they would have had every underoccupied paranoiac howling accusations of collusion with NAMBLA. But the rest of the novel Salem's Lot provides a perfectly fine and respectable plot line, which the screenwriters might have followed closely with excellent results.

Salem's Lot, as written, takes place in Maine. The landscape and atmospherics of Maine are not mere cosmetic aspects of setting in this work; they are very central and should and could have been authentic. Why wasn't this thing filmed in Maine, where there are plenty of suitable locations that could have been rented dirt cheap, instead of some obviously far-more-temperate location, with obvious leafy green vegetation sprayed with fake snow?

Though Salem's Lot is a very filmable novel, the first film made of it was pretty lame, and this one is downright annoying. I hope someday someone competent will make a movie of it.",1135036800,2,1302,5.037209302325581
2112540,3,B0002OXVG4,"Stephen King has not been treated kindly by the movies. For years, his books were turned into films. Most of them bad. None of them on par with the books. This has been remedied in the past few years by the television miniseries, the only format that can do King justice. For while he may be a horror writer,  it's King's gift for prose and characterization that makes him shine above others in the genre. The Shining and especially The Stand fared well as miniseries. Now Salem's Lot has been remade. The Tobe Hooper version (also made for TV) was flawed in that it made some unwise changes to the book and had a silly ending but it was genuinely scary. And to that end, this remake largely falls short.

(This review is written from the perspective of someone who has read the book and I assume most viewers will have read it or are familiar with it.)

I don't know why every writer who takes a crack at King has to change plot and character needlessly but it seems they do. This version has far too much setup before anything really happens. Some of the good stuff includes an updated backstory for Ben Mears and a much more sinister history for him with the Marsten house (in this version, he actually witnesses the suicide death of Hubie Marsten instead of only imagining it years later.) This version also includes Dr. Jim Cody and Father Callahan-one of whom was eliminated from the original and the other serving a much truncated role. The Barlow character is also a full-fledged one instead of a speechless Nosferatu that relied on the Straker character (played in the original by James Mason) for a voice and personality.

Alas most of the new material is unnecessary padding and I was largely bored by the first half. For example, a new story line about Dr. Cody having an affair with a patient and getting blackmailed that was not in the book and totally unnecessary.  These revisions on the original become particularly annoying when some of the best moments from the book are left out later on or not fully explained. One of the creepiest moments in the novel was when the team breaks into the Marsten House only to find Barlow had already relocated and left them a letter correctly guessing and urbanely threatening each team member. That was completely omitted. They do add a nice touch though with the subsequent discovery of Susan there that I won't reveal.

By failing to stick to the book and venturing out on his own, the screenwriter (Peter Filardi) also introduces a number of noticeable logic gaps. The characters make a point of saying vampires can't enter a home unless they are invited only to have Barlow later do just that without explanation. Later, after their leader is killed the vampires all seem to turn into zombies with one significant exception. While this made for a poignant interaction between two main characters, it made no sense. Certainly many horror films have idiosyncracies and you the viewer must at a certain point just let go and enjoy but the material must rise above them to make this possible.  This miniseries was also filmed in Australia and it's evident from the accents of the minor characters that something is amiss as their ill-fitting American accents occassionally slide all over the map. At one point, I wondered if one character had been changed to an Eastern European only to have her accent wander back to New England a few sentences later.

As for the cast, Donald Sutherland is brilliant in an over-the-top performance as the fey yet ominous Straker. He is easily the best part of the movie. Rob Lowe fares well as Ben Mears and Andre Braugher adds gravitas as Matt Burke. I also liked Samantha Mathis-where has she been hiding?-as Susan Norton and Dan Byrd as Mark Petrie, in a role that is closer to the book than the original film. Rutger Hauer was miscast, however, as Barlow in my opinion and as this is such an important part it's yet another flaw that fatally affects the movie. Overall, the second half somewhat redeems the first but this book is still waiting for better treatment.

(This DVD is well-made but contains no extras. Some deleted scenes might go a long ways toward rectifying the plot gaps but as it is the mystery of why this version had to reinvent a perfectly fine wheel will remain unsolved.)",1130630400,29,4287,4.667549668874172
2112541,4,B0002OXVG4,"Come on guys - it's not THAT bad. In fact, I'll put my neck out and say that it's better than the original (which did tend to drag on a bit). True, there are a heck of a lot of characters to keep tabs on, and with a couple of exceptions they're all thinly drawn, but I remember Stephen King saying way back that he intended Salem's Lot to be Peyton Place with vampires, so the mass of characters shown here is, I believe, in keeping with the author's original vision. It does have it's faults; the main one being that for the first hour we're treated to Ben Mear's bitter diatribe about the small town and how all the people in it are a pack of ratbags. As a result, we don't really care what happens to them. Things shift in the second half (after one of the characters says that Ben only sees the bad in people and ignores the good), but by then the damage has been done. I was also a bit uncomfortable with the climax, where fast moving vampires suddenly became shambling flesh-eating zombies.

Otherwise, I felt this was an enjoyable piece of horror pulp that worked as well as it could within the confines of a TV movie (it really needs to be turned into a three hour horror epic for the big screen where all of King's sexual and violent visions can be given full rein). Visually it's far superior to Tobe Hooper's version, and we've got a better cast (Donald Sutherland hams it up wonderfully and James Cromwell's interpretation of the priest who has fallen from grace is suitably seedy). Rob Lowe is a much more haunted man than David Soul, Rutger Hauer's Barlow is far superior to Reggie Nalder's Nosferatu rip-off, and even if the bulk of the supporting players are Australians and New Zealanders putting on broad American accents (which is always a weird experience for a New Zealander to watch), they all do a fine job.

2112542,3,B0002OXVG4,"A very long movie that has confusion written all over it due to the shifting of time from present to past...now where have i seen that before? I know i haven't read Stephen King's noval yet so that might have something to do with my early confusion but come on, give us some hints man....i know there is some narration at the beginning but that didn't help me one bit with all the little subplots going on. The main plot you wonder? When Rob Lowe was a little kid, he took a dare into the house and witness something that change his life forever. He comes back years later and you see him throw a Priest out the window, who happen to be working on Thanksgiving day giving out food to the homeless and hungry. Did it had anything to do with what happen when he was a little kid? Watch and see :o)

I will admit that even tho one can get confused from the very start while watching this movie as all the things is happening so fast around the many characters in this town, u get a sense that the director is losing his direction but it does work well because it adds suspense and the scenes are quite scary in a weird way. I didn't get bored one bit so that says alot too, especially since i seen so many crappy vampyre movies including some of the best like Blade and Interview with a Vampyre, my two all-time favorites for this genre.

I like to say to Rob Lowe, your acting was quite convincing as Ben Mears, the protagonist but you are no David Soul ..don't give up on us baby, don't make the wrong seem right, the future isn't just one night, its written in the moonlight, painted on the stars, we can't change ours .....ooohhh laa la la la la la la so don't give up on us i know, we can still come through...

Sorry for getting carried away a little bit there but watching this movie makes you wonder why evil make us do things we normally don't do...tempation you say? that's it as sin will doom us all if we continue to allow temptation to get the better of us. Then again, this movie is no different from the town that we live in...just look around with open eyes and you will clearly see what i am talking about. Just make sure you lock your doors before you go to sleep.

If your into scary vamprye movies or have read the noval, you might want to check out this installment of Salem's lot but don't be surprise if you are lost from the very start, as was I.

I've always loved the novel and the 1979 miniseries. When I heard they were doing a remake in 2004, I couldn't wait! Then I found out Rob Lowe was starring. Eeeh, he was in ""The Stand"" a decade earlier and that managed not to suck. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and tuned in. And in all fairness to Rob Lowe he can hardly be blamed for how awful it turned out.

Now I can understand changing around elements for ""dramatic purposes"" and ""updating"" and ""adapting for television"". Let's not forget the novel was written and published in the 1970's when there were no cellphones, laptop computers or Internet. It seems the fellow who adapted the novel, Peter Filardi, and went hog-wild with it. The end result is that the only the movie characters have in common with their book counterparts are the names. Ben Mears was once held captive by the Taliban? Matt Burke is gay? Susan Norton is a waitress? Did Filardi even read the novel? Then there is the problem of the very minor characters getting way, way, waaayyyy more screen time than they deserve, as in they shouldn't have been in the movie at all. Sandy McDougall, Dud Rogers, Charlie Rhodes and Ruthie Crockett are all very minor throw-away characters who don't deserve a place in the movie. Ruthie didn't even have any dialogue in the book for crying out loud!!! What is so special about these characters that they managed to get on screen and take away precious time from the real characters? This is reason why Barlow is reduced to a cameo, because Peter Filardi felt the inexplicable need to cram in as many characters as possible.

My biggest complaint is the way they handled the scene where a vampire Mike Ryerson comes back to Matt Burke's house. Instead of being a terrifying encounter with the undead it winds up a truly bizarre homo-erotic/necrophiliac encounter so completely drained of any suspense that left me scratching my head and wondering 'what the hell was that about'? Hey people, if it ain't broke don't fix it! If you had $25 million to spend on this movie why didn't you hire a writer who could actually write a suspenseful scene!! Stephen King should sue! Excuse me, I'm going to watch the 1979 version and try to put this slop out of my memory for good.",1126483200,135,2273,4.621287128712871

I always dread the filmed versions of books I like because the film makers have to jam about 400 pages into 120 minutes and of course..some parts of the novel, as well as charactors are dispensed with. The original 1979 TV miniseries had some excellent chill moments but did not follow the original story whereas this 2004 version did quite well but there were some problems. Ruthie Crockett and Dud were not fully fleshed out in the novel but expanded in this film and there were story alterations which I found quite annoying! I wish in a few years, a film director will approach Stephen King and get him to adapt his own novel for a screenplay much like he did for the excellent 1994 TV version of ""The Stand"" It will be an adult cinema film so you can show the horror without worrying about if kids are watching.

1)  Better than the 1979 version.  Better casting, better acting, no Kubrick, and better effects.  1979 was a laugh-fest, this one actually made me jump a bit.
2)  Not as good as the book.  Too much artistic freedom in swaying from the book.  There is not much benetration with the characters the way the book does.  And with the recent completion of the Dark Tower Series, Father Callahan is handled completely wrong.  Despite this, I still have the book I can go back to and visit if I want to get the story right.
3)  Entertaining.  If you've got nothing else to watch, you should catch this once.  I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I can't say that this was a complete waste of my time.
4)  Not for young-ones.  Make sure you put the kiddies to bed before sitting down to watch this.  This is most definately not for children despite the fact that it is made for TV.
5)  Didn't stick to the ""rules.""  Despite the flaws of this movie, the biggest one is the rules.  Every vampire story has their own set of rules and I don't like it when the rules are established and then later broken.  It got confusing because a rule for one instance was thrown out the window for the next.  If the rule doesn't apply anymore, explain why it doesn't.  In the end, I just felt cheated.

Unfortunately, this version of Stephen King's vampire tale is a total loss in every department, from casting (though I suppose the production team should get points for casting in the lead Rob Lowe, the only actor on earth blander than the original's David Soul), to scripting (the pause for dialogue between the hero, stake-in-hand, and the vampire he's about to kill, is mind-numbingly dumb), to set design (the interior of the haunted Marsten House is so ridiculously ""creepy"" that it's laughable).  The usually reliable Donald Sutherland is way, way over the top as the sinister advance man for the vampire Barlow, and the not always reliable Rutger Hauer (as Barlow) blows a good opportunity to erase the memory of horrifying-in-the-extreme Reggie Nalder from the original.  And while Andre Braugher is a fine actor, and he tries to generate some interest in his role as the ex-teacher of Lowe, he's about twenty years too young for the role, which gives the entire proceedings a kind of college theatre artificiality.  The centerpiece of all of Stephen King's work, whether on the page or on screen, is the concept of small town America and the secrets it harbors, and this ""Lot"" never captures that small town feeling.

I do give credit to this made for TV effort for many reasons:  it does follow the basic premise of the novel, and it has some interesting camerawork and a few good performances.  Can one imagine this movie with an actor like Tom Hanks playing Ben Mears?  Rob Lowe does a commendable job, but he comes across as so self-absorbed, and the depth of his persona is never fully realized.  Samantha Mathis does a credible job as Susan Norton, but she too comes across self-centered and judgmental.  Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer camp it up and are effective, but they never seem truly evil.  James Cromwell succumbs too quickly to Hauer's influence, and even Daniel Byrd as young Mark Petrie doesn't seem to see beyond his own feelings.  Some of the lesser known Australian actors fare better:  the town's sheriff; the lovely Eva, the landlady at the boarding house; the seductive Sandy McDougall; and even the town retarded man, Dud.  Andre Braugher tries to be Denzel Washington, but this talented actor is miscast in the role, and tying him to a hospital bed for the majority of his role hinders his performance.

 The principal cast are all excellent, with special note to Rob Lowe's performance which is a much more thorough examination of a troubled writer's psyche than the workday character of ben mears in the first mini-series and onscreen exposition replaced through clever usage of book-ending scenes and voice over narration.

 This adaptation is far closer to the spirit of King' book, with it's central character examining his own motives, his past and who he is colliding with an entire town coming apart at the seams through an infusion o foutside evil exposing the inner turmoil that the townfolk are already facing.

Not even talented actors like Donald Sutherland and James Cromwell could rescue this steamy turd of a film.

And what's with all the blatant modern references like sending emails and Straker being kicked out of the country for selling ecstacy (what?!). Stuff like that will only make this movie seemed dated in a few years. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest watching the far superior 1979 version staring David Soul and James Mason.

2112555,4,B0002OXVG4,"'SALEM'S LOT first aired on TNT in 2004. The budget for the two part miniseries was equal to that of a major motion picture and the look and feel of the film seems like a movie, not a television miniseries. Despite having been published around 25 years ago, the book that the movie is based upon remains one of Stephen King's most popular works.

'SALEM'S LOT is King's examination of what would happen if Dracula came to America. Author Ben Mears (Rob Lowe) returns to his hometown of Jerusalem's Lot, commonly known as Salem's Lot, to get some privacy and work on his latest book. Around the same time that Ben returns home, an antique dealer purchases an infamous house on the hill overlooking town for his ""employer"". A few days later strange events begin happening. A boy named Danny Glick disappears. A dog is impaled on the fence surrounding the community's graveyard. Danny Glick's body is found but looking not quite like Danny. The events quickly escalate until Ben and a small group of others realize that Dracula is in 'Salem's Lot and if they don't do something fast, no one will escape alive.

The movie changes several things from the original novel. However, a movie and a book are not the same things and overall the movie stays true to the spirit of the novel. My only complaint is what ends up happening to Father Callahan. Salem's Lot was one of the few books that Stephen King ever considered writing a sequel to, mostly because of Father Callahan. He later decided against it, but Father Callahan didn't disappear and has a major role to play in the Dark Tower series.

There have been a lot of comparisons of this movie with the made-for-tv 1979 version that was directed by Tobe Hooper. There really isn't much of a comparison. The 1979 version gains points for effort, but that's about it. Overall, the 1979 version is a mess of bad acting, bad writing, bad lighting and sets, and cheesy ""special effects"". That film does not hold up well and is nowhere near suspenseful, let alone frightening. This version holds up much better and though it makes more changes to the original storyline, this version flows much better, has better writing, excellent acting, and good special effects.

'Salem's Lot (Mikael Salomon, 2004)

Mikael Salomon was responsible for Aftershock (the New York City earthquake movie) and the TV adaptation of Dean Koontz' Sole Survivors. Do you need to know anything else? I will note for the record at the very beginning that this review does contain a number of spoilers for those who have neither read the novel nor seen the original 1979 screen adaptation. If you have experienced neither, I urge you to go out and do so immediately, before wasting a single minute on this piece of horse hockey.

It certainly starts off well enough. One of the first things of which we are made aware is that Dud Rogers, whose part was cut for the original adaptation, is back. This, however, should probably be popping up a small red flag in your head. If Salomon is bringing back minor characters, and this version is exactly as long as the previous version... what all is he going to cut out? Answer: way, way too much.

This adaptation of 'Salem's Lot suffers from an odd form of multiple personality disorder; in order to understand a single thing about what's going on, you have to have read the novel However, for a miniseries that requires viewers to have read the book, Salomon tried getting away with making huge, sweeping changes in the motivations of every character. Ben Mears is still back in town writing a book, but the nature of the book has changed. Ben has also gone from being an obscure literary author whose works are castigated in his hometown for their obscenity to being a Pulitzer-prizewinning author of nonfiction whose books are castigated for being liberal, which is completely gratuitous. Susan Norton and Ben still have chemistry, but the storybook affair has been trashed, thus making the Ben-and-Susan confrontation (which, for the second time, is handled completely differently than it is in the book) ring completely false. Mark Petrie has turned from an earnest believer in monsters into an obnoxious little jerk whose main goal in life seems to be to make trouble for everyone around him. He also no longer has a father, not that his father was a major character (but it smacks of new-age pop psychology-- ""I'm an obnoxious little jerk because I have no father""). Mark and the Glick brothers are much older, thus robbing the Ralphie Glick scenes of their built-in creepiness, and their mother is now a wealthy, thoroughly unlikable socialite (you can imagine what that takes away from her resurrection scene, one of the best pieces of the original adaptation). While a number of minor characters cut out of the novel in the 1979 adaptation return, one gets the feeling they returned simply to cater to those who thought the 1979 adaptation wasn't any good because it wasn't the book. Dud, the bus driver, Larry Crockett's daughter, and a number of others return, but their sole goal in being in the film is ""we're here to become vampires."" They are completely robbed of any of the characterization, emotional value, or complexity they have in the novel. Not exactly the best trade-off on the planet.

As well, the initial pace is increased here, but the sole reason for that seems to be to give extra time to killing off the ""kill me"" characters. It's as if some idiot studio exec is sitting in a big office saying ""if you film the opening scenes at the pace they are in the book, everyone will be too bored to watch after fifteen minutes."" Which is too bad, because it's obvious 'Salem's Lot needs at least eight, maybe twelve, hours for a comprehensive treatment. Get over it; 'Salem's Lot is not just about vampires. In fact, the vampires are really a minor concern (don't want to use the term ""allegory"" around a studio exec. They get testy when confronted with words of more than one syllable).

What is it that makes minor characters minor? Why is the Ben and Susan relationship so much more important (in the original, anyway; it's given the shortest of shrifts here) than Dud and Ruth? It's a simple answer, really, and opens the door to the main reason people outside Hollywood look at Hollywood films and scoff. For lack of a better way of putting it, I call it ""emotional shortcuts."" Emotional shortcuts are little tricks: when you see action X, you know the characters are feeling Y. They're cliches that are tacitly accepted in the film industry. They are another way of making movies safe; you know that when such things come up, you don't have to think about what they mean; you have seen them so many times, you already know. It's lazy in screenwriter, director, and viewer to accept such things with open arms. Unfortunately, Salomon and screenwriter Peter Filardi have stocked the miniseries chock full of emotional shortcuts; watch the first confrontation between Larry and Dud, while Ruth, torn with longing, approaches and backs away from her bedroom window repeatedly. There's not a shred of real emotion in the scene; it's all done via shortcut. The end result is that the characters may look like they have a surface complexity, when in fact they're still cardboard cutouts capable of blowing over at the first hard wind. Unfortunately, most of them are also windbags.

To put the last little crowning glory on the pain that this causes, Ed ""Weasel"" Phillips' character is listed in the credits as ""Ed Weasel.""

And the worst part is, I haven't hit all the bad points. I haven't even come close. It gets a single star because I did, in fact, finish watching till the end. Oh, and those of you hoping for a Mikael Salomon-helmed miniseries of Wolves of the Calla will likely be sorely disappointed at some ""slight"" changes made to Callahan's character towards the end. *",1106611200,16,5711,4.779128672745694
2112557,3,B0002OXVG4,"tecnical review:

I screened this from the DVD put out by TNT.

the budget on imdb.com says $25,000,000 (estimated) for a TV Movie.  Which is considered high-end production on similar level

as HBO original productions. Heck there are many feature film's with a smaller budget that sound better. Take ""Thirteen

Ghosts"" for example, which had an amazing soundmix for a horror film (budgeted at $20 million for 1/3 less running time).

TNT was only the U.S. distributor, not the company making the film. The production companies The Wolper Organization & Warner

Brothers Television & Coote Hayes Productions in Austrailia cuts corners on the wrong places, like the sound mix on a horror

film, which is what a vampire movie falls under. This genre relies on the sound in a film to sell a film much more so than

being presented in high definition video. Look at ""28 Days Later"" shot on miniDV video.

The sound for Salem's Lot had rustle over much of the dialogue which meant they were using body lav microphones. Big shows

like The West Wing use them for their long walk and talks, but they also have a wardrobe dept. who sew in the lav mics into

the costumes. If this were a feature film at least some of that would have been ADR'd.  The foley was pretty bad too as it

sounded to me like there wasn't any for much of the walking scenes in the film, it was intermittent footsteps.

At least they had a good instrumental soundtrack.

This film was telecined and mastered in high definition video. I thought it was filmed and lit very well.

The American Society of Cinematographers, USA gave 'Salem's Lot' the ASC 2005 Award Nomination for Outstanding Achievement in

Cinematography in Movies of the Week.

the sound mix to be poor in this feature, so much so that I could barely understand the dialogue in many scenes. Watching in

Dolby Digital 5.1 with a surround setup i found dialogue hard to hear for first half of the film. the narration voiceover was

in 5 channels for some reason, but the main dialogue in the center channel was muffled.

While _SOME_ of the scenes in the last third of the film had some decent sound design with directional surround sound, a lot

of the dialogue was just muffled, the reverb in the prison scenes sounded so bad (= fake-sounding modulated voices) like a

preset METAL ROOM on a digital audio workstation was used with bad ADR looping. The sound department certainly had their work

cut out for them and with a budget and a schedule which was not up to the task of a 180 minute feature on a $25 million

budget.

It's up to the sound designer/supervising sound editor/ sound effects editor/designer who create a sound for a horror film to

scare the audiences with the visuals. It's all about the suspense and editing with the picture. A truly collaborative effort more so on a horror film than on a typical drama.

Donald Sutherland was amazing as the charming yet evil Straker, and Rutger Howard was an amazing Barlow. But anyone who has read the book knows that Barlow was NEVER a nasfaratu, he was infact very human and very very very charming, like Straker, so to say that the movie didn't follow the book then dog the fact that they made Barlow look like the book Barlow(with the exception of the hair) is a little self contradicting. I enjoyed the movie, and I am as well a HUGE fan of King and Salem's Lot is my favorite favorite favorite book. The movie was absolutely amazing. It didn't follow the book, (Certain specific details of people were missed, and a lot of characters were combined into 1 person, and the story line went a different way.) but I think it did the book perfect justice. The original did nothing for the book, but the new version was absolutely haunting. I have seen the movie over 6 times and every time i jump or get scared. It's amazing, it really is, and the performances are amazing as well. Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Straker was in no way tired, it was in fact very intense. I would not have picked any one else to play the evil Mr. Straker, because Mr. Sutherland got him down to a T. Rutger Howard as the dark Mr. Barlow did an amazing job in his roll as well. His old yet charming and spphisticated looks made one warm up to him before they realized what he really was. It's hard not to like Mr. Barlow at the beginning of the movie because he does such a wonderful job. Finally, there is the wonderfully talented, absolutely gorgeous Rob Lowe as the talented writer Mr. Ben Mears. Lowe did a fenominal job portraying the troubled writer, and he was in no way a ""horrible lead"" as some people say. His voice, looks, and charm were seemed to be pulled straight from King's mind, And noone but Lowe could pull off the simple helplessness and strength that makes Ben Mears such a tragic hero. Even the young Mark Petrie was portrayed beautifully by the adorable Daniel Byrd. Dan brought out the perfect essence of Mark--the adolescent ability to believe in the darkest possibilities and still have the courage to take it on. I guess what I am trying to say is that this movie is absolutely amazing, and i hope you all will agree.",1103068800,5,2649,4.463917525773196

It took some liberties of course. For a tv mini-series it had some creepy glowing eyed vampires.  Rutger Hower was Barlow the Nostferotu. He wasn't as scary as I hoped.  In the book, Barlow didn't have to talk his power was in his eyes, so is Rutgers. He should've just kept his mouth shut and it would have been more powerful and sinister.

2112562,2,B0002OXVG4,"I watched this in the three-hour DVD format and it's way too long.  An hour of this could have been left on the cutting room floor.  Time-waster sub-plots go nowhere.  Like the doctor having an affair and getting blackmailed by the husband.  Then he takes his lover's baby to the hospital and has it admitted under his own name.  Then what?  This goes nowhere so why bother.

And I didn't care for the backdrops.  I haven't read the book but the town looked all wrong for a horror flick.  It was repulsive in a trashy way, but not scary.  In a horror film I'm looking more for an eerie, gothic setting.  Not the kind of trashy neighborhoods we can all see every day on our way to work.

The story moves at such a snail's pace in the beginning that when the scary scenes start happening, you're still trying to figure out what's going on unless you're familiar with the book or the original movie.  The actors do the best they can with a lousy script.

2112563,5,B0002OXVG4,"TNT has really outdone themselves with this production of Stephen King's book, Salem's Lot.  Rob Lowe turns in fine acting along with the rest of the cast in the story of a big city writer returning to his roots in the small town of Jerusalem's Lot.  The town, seemingly ordinary in most aspects, is dominated by the ominous looking Marsden House, high on a hill.  The house has been abandoned for twenty-five years, since the owner committed a terrible crime there.  Ben Meers is writing a book on the history of the house, when he finds out it has been bought by mysterious new owners, antique dealers (Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer).

I was very impressed with this film.  Not to mention it gave me a long and terrifying nightmare.  It has been many years since a movie gave me a nightmare.  Stephen King obviously wrote the character of Ben Meers based on himself.  It is fun to see Rob Lowe with Stephen King's hair.

The camera work is amazing, especially the shots of the area from above, and the shots of the Marsden House.  At three hours, this DVD is an unbeatable buy for your money.",1101254400,6,1096,4.540816326530612
2112564,4,B0002OXVG4,"I'm sort of writing this is response to all the negative reviews of the movie I've read here, something I normally wouldn't do. I came at this from a different angle, I think. I'm not particularly a Stephen King fan; my reaction to his written work is one of ambivalence. I think he's an entertaining, engaging storyteller, but he's hardly a great writer, at least in my humble opinion. His characters are almost never convincing or genuine, his dialogue is contrived, artificial, his story endings almost invariably lose steam and go flat, and he seems to share Steven Spielberg's weakness of inserting the ""precocious"" child into nearly every storyline. Having said all that, ""Salem's Lot"" was probably my favorite of King's books. For all the weaknesses mentioned above, and more, it worked (albeit in the way a lurid comic-book can work), and has been a favorite of mine through the years. The TV movie of 1979 was a bitter disappointment. Granted, James Mason is one of the all-time great actors, but making him the centerpiece and relegating the character of Barlow to a non-speaking Nosferatu rip-off was truly a misguided move. One thing one can say of the book, regardless of its flaws, is that it wasn't boring. The 79 tv movie was boring. Not so this new adaptation. Yes, liberties are also taken with the original story, but they show true inspiration and imagination, virtues sadly lacking from the 79 version. It many ways, to my mind, the innovations enhance King's story. The characters come across as more fragile, more damaged, and nuanced, less stereotypical, more disturbed and, hence, more disturbing. The acting is first-rate; I'm no big fan of Rob Lowe, but he's surprisingly effective here. Also, Rutger Hauer is not the actor I would have picked to play Barlow, but he does his job admirably, with commendable restraint and presence, and my only quibble is that the character isn't given more screen time. The whole atmosphere conveys a sense of a dark, crawling pestilence and aura of miasmic menace that was missing even from King's book, much less the 1979 travesty supposedly based on that work (and if you think King's concept was really all that original, check out the low-budget movie ""Return of Dracula"" from the 1950's with Francis Lederer). Is this the best vampire movie ever made? Hardly. But it's probably the best film adaptation of King's work that's ever been made, and considering that artists as diverse as Stanley Kubrick and David Cronenberg have offered their own interpretations of King's work, that's not faint praise.",1100476800,16,2567,4.958236658932715
2112565,4,B0002OXVG4,"I was surprisingly pleased with this adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Salem's Lot.  I've always been a big fan of the book (and recently re-read it in reference to King's Dark Tower series), however, I never really enjoyed the original adaptation.  Admittedly, this version strays from the novel, notably with regard to Father Callahan.  Rob Lowe does well as the title character, author Ben Mears, and the other characters are well developed.  An excellent cast of stars, including Andre Braugher, James Cromwell, and Donald Sutherland (though I would have liked to seen him get more screen time).  Rutger Hauer is surprisingly good as Kurt Barlow.

Give it a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1100304000,2,709,5.121739130434783
2112566,2,B0002OXVG4,"Terrible adaptation of one of Stephen King's best novels.  As sure to alienate fans of the book as it is to bore the casual viewer.
This isn't the kind of movie that stands up well to repeated viewings.  Even watching it once is a chore.  And it isn't faithful enough to earn a place in a Stephen King DVD collection.  It's as bad as that recent remake of Carrie that has Carrie surviving prom night and fleeing town to use her powers for good.  So I recommend renting Salem's Lot if you feel you absolutly have to see it.

Salem's Lot needs to be done as a theatrical release.  This isn't War & Peace or even The Stand.  There's no reason a faithful adaption can't be done as a two hour movie.

The original had some truly scary moments.  The strong suit of this update is the casting of Rob Lowe and Rutger Hauer as Mears and Barlow respectivly.  James Cromwell is terrific as Father Callahan (although his character's fate is re-written and made more gory, but ultimatly less disturbing and poetic than in the novel).  But both versions are mind-numbingly long, and pointlessly deviate from the source material.  And both suffer from the hokey production values of made for TV movies.

While I'm doubtful Salem's Lot will ever see big screen treatment, that isn't to say this dreadful mini-series is any kind of substitute for that.",1099526400,7,1335,4.578059071729958

2112568,1,B0002OXVG4,"'Salem's Lot is easily the most terrifying of Stephen King's novels.  A dark and evil tale that scares the crap out of you.  The 1979 version although annoying to purists (including myself) for the monsterfication of Barlow and some dodgy scriptwriting had one thing in common with the novel - it too was terrifying, it positively traumatised some viewers.

Bottom line:  This is no more frightening than a tame episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it's an absolute pile of rubbish..... I find it extraordinary that a director can take such extraordinary material and turn it into something so utterly pedestrian.... and make no mistake here... the main problem was not the script, nor even the acting but the direction.

Three of the major scenes in the book and '79 version were ruined by the director here -- Danny Glick at the window, Marjorie Glick in the mortuary and the return of Mike Ryerson.  How can you possibly ruin these scenes?  A child holding the camera couldn't ruin these scenes.

Thoroughly disappointing, even more so because now Salomon has queered the pitch for everyone else -- no one else will be able to make this again for the next twenty years.",1098230400,46,1172,4.796019900497512
2112569,1,B0002OXVG4,"Firstly let me say that I love Stephen Kings Salems Lot. It's my favorite vampire novel, so no film could do justice to the material. But this adaption is just a crime. Living in the U.K. I imported this and genuinely looked forward to watching it. As good as Tobe Hoopers 70s version of the novel was I was never happy with his take on Barlow. So here was the chance to put things right. What a waste of effort. From a writer more interested in putting his grubby fingerprints all over Kings story to a director who seemed absent from events. I mean really, what is the point of adapting a novel and then deviating from it so completely! I've seen episodes of ""charmed"" that were scarier. Half the cast were Australian doing poor American accents. It was so miscast, the priciple cast seemingly fedexing their perfomances in. New England, Maine, looked more like Alaska. If you plan to import this (non U.S / Canadaian folk) don't. Just watch Tobe Hoopers version (re-read the novel) and hope in another 10 years or sooner someone has the good sense to do that novel justice. Perhaps Like Anne Rice with Interview with the vampire, Stephen King must over see the script personally.",1098230400,21,1182,4.606635071090047
2112570,3,B0002OXVG4,"The original miniseries with Mr. Soul and the rest was right on the money with their 1979 effort.  This updated version was lacking the suspense and the outright horror of some scenes. James Mason was sorely needed in the role of Straker. Don't get me wrong Donald Sutherland is a good actor, he was just horribly miscast in this role.  Rob Lowe was very un-convincing as the man with all the secrets and some of the answers, Ben Mears. That role belongs to Mr. Soul now.  Also noticeably absent were the special effects. They had good ones on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, why not use them here? All in all this is a good time waster.

The first adaption captures the loss and horror of a small town slipping into darkness very acutely even if the particulars of the story differed more. The hit and miss, very mostly miss, attempts at humor at exactly the wrong times killed the dread and horror which is at the heart of Kings novel. It's a real pity.",1098057600,4,680,4.82051282051282
2112572,4,B0002OXVG4,"i have to disagree with the amazon review. this did not deviate from or miss any of the vampire lore. in fact this and the book, illustrate more of what a vampire in folklore is. the tobe hooper film is on the same level, only missing out on the number one spot in that it is slightly dated. the new version has some differences from the book, but not that they make a difference. all in all, hollywood has done a better job with this novel than dracula in film adaptation. this is essentially dracula in the 20th century anyways, as king will acknowledge. rob lowe did a marvelous job. there was a few parts in the movie where the acting seemed rushed, but overall, this film was well done for tv. updated special effects and a sense of forboding for the town as a whole make this film a nice compliment to hooper's version. this film developed characters better and does not suffer from david soul's underacting and the nosferatu like barlow. r hauer is great. i get the feeling that i am watching my own town in this film, the characters are so normal and real. the cinematography almost will allow you think you can smell the crisp air or stench of mold and death. overall an excellent film. definately one of the better vampire films of recent date. this quickly became a favorite. i have watched it 10 times since it came out.",1097971200,4,1332,4.41869918699187
2112573,3,B0002OXVG4,"I'll have to admit, the original 'Salem's Lot TV Film by Tobe Hooper had some creepy moments. To this day, the image of the boy floating in front of Mark's window stands up there with anything produced for wide release. However, it deviated from the book significantly. The most amazing (and lame) change being that Barlow never said a word. He was just one creepy looking Nosferatu.

The biggest difference between Hooper's adaptation and Mikael Salomon's adaptation is the sense you get of the town of Jerusalem's Lot. More time is given in this recent adaptation to the various characters in the town. You get more of an impression that not only are the townspeople being slaughtered, but the town itself.

Rob Lowe does a decent job playing Ben Mears. Suitably intense and way beyond the range I expected of him. Also a standout is Robert Mammone, playing the town doctor. Andre Braugher's part is something of a throwaway, as is Sutherland's. Rutger Hauer is passably evil playing Barlow, but the character still feels short-shrifted somehow. Barlow didn't scare me at all, not like Tobe Hooper's version.

I was majorly disappointment with the character arc of Father Callahan, played well by James Cromwell, especially given the amount attention Callahan gets as a character in Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" series. I realize it shouldn't mean anything in regards to this miniseries, but it irked nevertheless.

Overall, this new adaptation hits most of the right marks. It still feels like a TV movie, despite some of the special effects. Don't get rid of your old Hooper version, though. These two films are very different and each are worthwhile.",1097712000,4,1654,4.981884057971015

Salem's Lot was the first King book I ever read and remains my favorite.  Neither movie did a great job of really capturing the terror of the book but I think the original was a bit better.  It just seemed a bit creepier and darker.

I think most of the leads of the orginal did a better job including James Mason as the vampire servent Straker, who just emitted more evil than the tired Donald Sutherland.  Add to that I preferred the nosferatu looking vampire as opposed to the more normal looking Rutger Hauer as Barlow.  Again...he was just creepier.

There were some effective scenes such as the one in the prison with the vampire crawling through the air duct but overall this production seemed a bit flat.",1097539200,5,889,4.41717791411043

I love the '79 version - it was atmospheric, creepy and had some great character development.  The Barlow vampire was very scary and lead to some wonderfully terrifying moments...BUT he was nothing like Barlow from the book.

This new adaptation stays closer to the Barlow of the book and then updates some of the other characters.

I found the jail scene between Rob Lowe's Ben Mears and the vampire in the next cell to be very creepy and the vampire kids on the bus was terrifying in my opinion.

If there is one thing we have learned over the years it is that King's work is hard to adapt well....unless you're Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile) or Rob Reiner (Misery, Stand By Me).

This is by no means the load of 'crap' it is described as by some less polite reviewers...but then again maybe they haven't seen Maximum Overdrive or Graveyard Shift.

8030180,4,B0002OXVG4,"Beginning the story in Detroit with Father Callaghan feeding the homeless, only to be confronted by Ben Mears among them was a fascinating addition. If only I didn't feel like we were missing a major part of the storyline between the events in Salems Lot and that starting point.

Some of the changes in this version of Salems Lot didn't appeal to me. It was a delight to have Ben Mearss flashbacks included in the story. They were effective and creepy. I just wish theyd been closer to the ones in the book.

Rob Lowe was an outstanding Ben Mears. He infused considerable pathos and passion into every soft spoken line, including his narrative voice overs. His interactions with Mark, Susan, Matt, Jimmy, Floyd, Callaghan, Straker, and Barlow and the nurse he confided his story to were riveting, leaving me hungry for more.

I wasn't sure how well I liked the change in Ben Mearss character, the shift from his focus on the Marsten House to the town of Salems Lot its. I didn't like the change in his books, either, although I understood the reasoning behind the change, to make both him and his works more contemporary.

In spite of all this, Ben Mearss character was a compelling one, whom I found myself liking and sympathizing with.

Im not sure how well I liked the changes in Mark Petrie either. I really enjoyed the depiction of him in the novel as a slight, almost pretty boy whom was a lot braver and stronger than anyone guessed by looking at him. Turning him into a self assured punk, poor and fatherless, yet exuding an alpha like aura of leadership over the boys age took away some of the softness of his appearance and the underlying strength which made him an appealing character to me. The young man who played this version of Mark did an excellent job, though. He met Rob Lowe and matched him in power of performance. He brought depth and additional tension to the highly charged confrontations with Barlow.

It was great to have Barlow played as a character rather than simply a silent monster, although Rutger Hauer isn't whom I would have pictured or chosen in the role. He did a remarkable job, nonetheless, bringing strength and moral ambiguity to his interactions with many of the characters, all the while remaining a terrifying villain.

Donald Sutherland was more overtly wicked than James Mason was in the role of Richard Straker years ago in the 1979 movie. He brought a certain measure of dark, playful humor to the character. His confrontation with Ben, half flirtatious and laced with adversarial amusement is one of my favorites in the movie.

Three of the changes I thorougly enjoyed involved Matt Burke, Susan Norton, and Eva. The alteration in Matt not only brought a touch of rainbow diversity to Salems Lot, but he served as a foil for Ben Mears as well as a mentor, opposing him alternately with optimism and cynicism when they were first getting acquainted. These made an interesting foundation in their relationship when the two of them later turned to vampire hunting.

Susan showed a lot more spunk, coming closer to the book version of the character. She participated in intellectual conversations with Ben, matching wits with him, becoming much more interesting as a romantic interest and well rounded a character.

Eva was simply breathtaking. A lovely, aging matriarch, a lady in the truest sense of the word, she embodied the heart of Salems Lot and the corruption at its heart. Her secrets, along with her darkest moment brought a touch of the elements I enjoyed most in Return to Salems Lot, reminding me of many of the genteel ladies whove appeared in Anne Rices novels.

It was a delight to see Jimmy Cody and Father Callaghan resuming larger roles in the plot. Callaghan was much darker, more interesting, and fit well within the revised plot, although I still feel like a part of that plot is missing. I also found his moment of racism while possessed gratuitous and unnecessary.

I could have done without the changes to Jimmy, although the actor playing him did a marvelous job. He had some great scenes with Ben, which are among the better quiet moments.

Certain plot changes rolled my eyes, others intrigued me, and homages to other works of pop cultural supernatual horror made me smile. For my overall enjoyment and the quality of the movie, I give Salems Lot four stars.",1514419200,2,4333,4.7383798140770255
