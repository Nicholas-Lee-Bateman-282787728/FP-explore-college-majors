5191488,5,B008YRL7JE,I bought this set for my son for Christmas.  He says that it is very good.  I would recommend this DVD set.,1357257600,,107,3.8181818181818183
5191489,5,B008YRL7JE,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like Black Lagoon, but was able to get the dvd/blu-ray combo on a different site for a pretty good price, so I checked it out.  Normally I'm not a big fan of big action shoot-em-up type of anime, but I was pleasantly surprised with Black Lagoon!

My first thought was that it's similar to Cowboy Bebop.  But Black Lagoon ended up being much superior to Cowboy Bebop in my personal opinion.  The individual story arcs are about 3-4 episodes each, which is the perfect amount of time to build a nice storyline and climax (much better than Bebop's short one-episode stories) without it ever getting boring or dragged out.  The action itself is awesome and its actually meaningful because the story has already drawn you in.  The animation is vibrant and beautiful.

The language is very foul.  The violence is very graphic.  The action is not very realistic (Revy consistenly takes out full platoons of guys without ever getting shot once herself) but that's what this is, an over-the-top type of show.  Some of the characters are more like superheros.  And even though you might dislike Revy at times (cus she is psychotic) I can promise you'll be rooting for her when she's up against the enemy.  Dont expect any big conclusion here, but its a great adventure.",1356048000,7,1291,4.663716814159292
5191490,5,B008YRL7JE,"In 2002, Rei Hiroe (""Gunparade March"", ""Phantom Bullet"", ""Blade Guns"") would create his latest manga ""Black Lagoon"".  Featured on Shogakukan's ""Monthly Sunday Gene-X"" and still an ongoing series today, the manga series would receive an anime adaptation by Studio Madhouse in 2006.  The first ""Black Lagoon"" series featured 12 episodes and several months later, the second season titled ""The Second Barrage"" would air in Japan.  And in 2010, the OVA series titled ""Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail"" was released in Japan via OVA.

Both seasons were released on DVD in the U.S. back in 2008 and 2009 from Geneon Entertainment and FUNimation Entertainment and aired on television via Starz Edge.  And now the series will be released on Blu-ray as a complete set (not including the OVA's) in December 2012 courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

""Black Lagoon"" is a series that has a strong following in the U.S.  According to Rei Hiroe, the series was inspired by James Ellroy, John Woo, Quentin Tarentino and Stephen King and also the piracy cases that took place in the East China Sea back in the '90s.  A big Tarentino fan, ""Black Lagoon"" pays homage to films by Quentin Tarentino but also films from the Coen Brothers.

VIDEO:

""Black Lagoon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ration).  First, I have to admit that prior to watching this Blu-ray release, I was expecting the series that would look good as an upconvert, considering it was made back in 2006. And because it's a TV series, expecting the usual TV series softness.  But prior to the Blu-ray release, I always thought that ""Black Lagoon"" was a series that looked stunning on DVD.  Felt that Studio Madhouse did a wonderful job with the character design and shading of the characters and really going out in bringing Rei Hiroe's characters and the ""Black Lagoon"" world to life in an anime series.

On Blu-ray, I will say that the series looks much better with bolder colors, better line detail and I wasn't detecting any major banding or artifact issues while watching his Blu-ray release.  There is softness, as expected from a TV series, but for an upconvert, ""Black Lagoon"" looks very good on Blu-ray!

AUDIO:

""Black Lagoon"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  And as one can expect from its lossless 5.1 soundtrack, there is better dynamic range due to the plenty of action in each episode, the 5.1 soundtrack utilizes the surround channels effectively, especially with LFE.  Explosions, gunshots, this is an active anime series that sounds great on Blu-ray.  But I also want to add that the English dub track was very well done!  For a series that features a diverse group, the writers for the English dialogue knew they could make the storyline feel like a seedy underground environment and that is too have your characters become the badasses with profanity and all.

Where the Japanese soundtrack is very good and appropriate for television, ""Black Lagoon"" has an English soundtrack that works effectively because of its profanity and nature of the main characters.  Revy is featured as a loudmouth, a person who can easily cuss up a storm and the writers took advantage of that.  Especially making the characters feel real thanks to casting.  The English dub track has is made better by its more mature dialogue.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Once in awhile, you come across anime series that manage to entertainment American audiences more than the audience in Japan.  Typically, these are series that tend to feature a lot of action and series that happen to be very violent.

And with Rei Hiroe's inspiration from Quentin Tarentino and Coen Brothers films, he knew what he enjoyed about those films and did his best to create a storyline that incorporate the seedy criminal underground life.  Full of people who are greedy, dangerous and often are deadly.

""Black Lagoon"" is an interesting and unique anime series because most often, series that showcase protagonists who are thieves often are comedic and tend to use a slapstick style of comedy.  But with ""Black Lagoon"", it's a series that was cleverly planned in how various crime organizations from different countries are integrated but also the moral dilemma that arises when the Lagoon team brings in Rock as their newest member.

You have characters who have come from terrible childhoods and had to compensate by becoming a criminal.  Revy is a Chinese American who has lived in poverty and will do all it takes to never ever be poor, but at the same time, not many have tried to calm her anger.  There is so much pain, so much hatred in her character but no one was brave enough to stand up to her, that is until we meet Rock.

What is interesting about Rock is that he's not great with fighting, nor is he great with artillery.  He's a smart man who knows his geography, linguistics but also a man who gave his company his all, and now his company pretty much did all they can to kill him off because they were trying to hide their illegal dealings.

As Rock sees himself as a dead man with no strong ties to his past, he moves on as a new man with the Lagoon Company but also a man who has morals, a man who finds it difficult to think why criminals do the things they do.  Why men, women, children get killed.  But as his fellow associates don't question their jobs, Rock is there to challenge, to question them.  And it becomes very difficult for a person like Revy, who has lived her life hating or fighting for what she hates.  She has taken on the worst of the worst with her gun but yet this one man, without a gun, fights back with his words.  Not afraid to upset her, not afraid to get in her face and tell her how he feels, knowing that he will get hurt by her.  He doesn't care, as long as he gets his word out.

You don't really see this in a anime series.  And throughout ""Black Lagoon"", we see Rock getting involved with various crime organizations and those wonder how the Lagoon company could hire someone so ""good"".  But they start to realize that even though he is a ""good"" guy, he's also a smart guy that makes good decisions most of the time, especially in the best interest of the client and his Lagoon friends.

And ""Black Lagoon"" not only offers a deep and clever story, it also offers a lot of action and violence.  What would you expect from an anime series that was inspired by Quentin Tarentino films?  Suffice to say, it's the action that gets viewers all pumped.  Along with ""Hellsing"", ""Black Lagoon"" is an anime series that shows crazy violence, gun wars, explosions, people being impaled.  But it's what makes ""Black Lagoon""so popular is that it delivers in action and storyline and also for its time, Studio Madhouse really created a series that looked amazing.

But how does it stack up on Blu-ray via upconvert?  Well, it is important for people to remember that these are TV series and while there is wonderful animation, great character shading and art backgrounds, as one can expect from a TV series, there is softness.  And it's important for people to remember that the series was released in 2006 and I've always said it before that series made after 2008, are the type of series that tend to look more amazing in HD.  But with that being said, I have seen some really amazing upconverts from FUNimation of older series and ""Black Lagoon"" can be put in the category of very good upconverts.  Colors are bold, line detail is very good and I detected no problems whatsoever in terms of banding, artifacts.  Fans of the series will definitely be pleased with this Blu-ray release.  And the Blu-ray also contains a good number of special features.

Was there anything that I found bad about this set?  Not really, unless you were really hoping that the OVA series would be included.  But you get both TV series included in this set and for its price on Blu-ray, it's a pretty good deal (especially compared to how much people paid for the DVD set back then).

Overall, ""Black Lagoon: Complete Set - Season 1 & 2 has received a distinction in America of being one of the better anime action series to be released stateside.  I tend to look at ""Black Lagoon"" as an action anime series with a unique storyline that is a rarity to see among the plethora of action anime series released each year.  But for the most part, I enjoyed the series then and I enjoy it even now on Blu-ray.

If you are an anime fan who craves kick ass action with a well-written storyline, look no further, ""Black Lagoon: Complete Set - Season 1 & 2 is highly recommended!",1355788800,39,9323,4.688847812692544

5191495,5,B008YRL7JE,"I don't believe I have ever had reason to say this before, but despite the fact that Black Lagoon's plot is basically a bunch of disconnected adventures that feature the same characters but have little to do with each other, I don't care one bit. Seriously, between the well-animated and completely bat&*%# insane action sequences, the witty Tarantino-esque dialogue, and the overall grim and gritty tone resembling a 70's action thriller, it's really hard to care about the lack of a single continuous story. You get four main characters, all of whom are likable (even if Rock takes some time to grow on you), an incredibly memorable cast of supporting characters, villains, and even a Terminator Maid (come on, everyone who has seen the show makes that reference), and a bunch of stories that, for the most part, basically act as setups for all of the bat*$&% insane action sequences and the really cool, tense dialogue heavy scenes. The only exception is the last story which can actually be considered a plot that advances the main characters (particularly since the story takes up half of the entire second season), and it is easily one of the best stories to watch. I cannot recommend this show enough to people who like Tarantino movies, action movies, grim and gritty crime thrillers, or just watching insanely entertaining characters. This is one show that definitely deserved to be rescued from Geneon hell and it belongs on everyone's movie shelf. Pick it up now.",1352505600,,1474,4.923694779116466

Straight-forward, down-to-earth.. starring the cold/hard, ruthless Revy.

This bizarre, in-progress century has already produced a handful of a number of great comedies, which is to say that many of your (and our) favorites were left out: sorry, Toy Story 3; sorry, Knocked Up. As we tend to lean toward the indie side  and away from certain men-behaving-badly movies  there are also some titles on here that you might not have seen. But, hey.. it's anime, right? But, with real life sitcoms?
Jokes on you guys, don't judge the cover!

Condescendingly bitchy, satire, raunchy, vulgar, bodily-function, smutty, and all of the crude humor in all its current glory..
Everything to describe this series.

That being said this series is excellent for those of us who want  severe hard action with blood and carnage. Black Lagoon delivers. I binged watched it and was entertained with the whole set up.
Others may claim there is little character development, I disagree I found the main characters to be fairly well fleshed out and true to their nature. These are hard edged people who are in a kill or be killed life. Definitely not for anyone under 15.

If you are interested in an anime that is for a mature audience about the criminal underworld, then this is your show. Like it says on the box, there is plenty of cursing (mostly Revy, who is on the cover), violence and gore (shootouts), badass female characters, and generally messed up stuff that one would expect in this hardcore setting.

Best part of all? This show makes you grow to like and care for Lagoon Company, even though their morals can be questionable at times. Revy is crazy for violence and bloodshed yet you really start to like her the more you dive in (2nd arc pun). Of course, no anime is complete without a pacifist character that tries to solve all the problems without violence; this goes to Rock. The Lagoon Company is really diverse in many ways, and their interactions really work well.

If you are interested in this genre and have the stomach for it (its not that bad), then you will have quite some fun watching this.

5191592,5,B008YRL7JE,"- Synopsis: The main character was just an ordinary businessman. Until one day, a fateful encounter changes his life dramatically. This anime showcases the adventures of the main character and his new-found allies. Their line of work involves espionage, guns blazing shoot-outs, and other dangerous situations. As he attempts to earn his keep with these unique mercenaries, the dangers all around him never seems to end. Just like the groups' ammo reserves.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is great for mature viewers. It touches on more of the rough and darker side of life. Our poor main character gets dragged in with people he normally wouldn't ever hang out with. Probably worth mentioning that there is a lot of swearing. You'll find them swearing in almost every episode. But they do so in a comedic way. It's just hilarious. They can be a bit racist but again, it's done in a funny way.

I watched it in Japanese audio. The English one isn't bad either. But I just couldn't help but laugh at hearing Japanese voice actors swear and drop the f-bomb in English! It's something you just don't see often in animes. Good times.

- Analysis: One concept is the survival of the fittest mentality. People and animals will do whatever it takes to survive. From eating whatever is available, to forming groups to increase their chances of survival, and so on. Likewise, although our main character is weaker than the rest of the group due to lack of combat experience, he makes up for it with his adaptability and quick-thinking. Although the group  is involved in dangerous missions, sticking with them is his best chance for survival since they are professionals. After all, it's not uncommon for the weak to cling to the strong.

The title is fitting, as well. Psycho-Pass mentions a swamp of sorts. In other words, lagoons and swamps are most likely an analogy for a place that's dark and almost impossible to get out from once you're stuck. In a way, they may be alluding that life is basically a swamp/lagoon. And that it's filled with evil and darkness. Once you get caught up, there's no returning; It will also corrupt you. A fairly dark and pessimistic way of thinking on the outlook of life. That basically there's more evil in the world than there is good. An interesting perspective.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 24 episodes on 3 Blu-rays and 24 on 3 DVDs with a run time of about 10 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood, strong language, and some disturbing scenes.

5191594,3,B008YRL7JE,"Ok, I'll be the three starred nay sayer here. Don't get me wrong - there are good things about this show. I like the characters and feel like they are well rounded overall. Rock, Revy, Eda and the Taiwanese assassin were particularly enjoyable.  There were definitely some humorous moments but the ending was like 'WHAT?' I was literally sitting there going 'that can't be it. that can't seriously be all we were building up to.'

It is entertaining, but if you are looking for an anime with a developed plot and deeper meaning, or even an actual villain, look into getting your hands on Trigun. Black Lagoon feels incomplete. It feels like it should be a smaller piece of  a much larger story and yet, here we are. I'm sad, because as I said, I did LIKE these characters. And I wanted more out of them than this. I wanted to see Revy's character develop into a more well-rounded character, maybe have her face some of her demons. And though Rock has the most character development of them all, I feel like they still could have pushed it further. I wanted to see him develop more as a  civilian person who was thrust into this criminal underworld and though he becomes more accepting of it I feel like all he did was adapt to it, which in hindsight, you would have to to survive this sort of situation but I thought maybe we could see him becoming a more sophisticated criminal himself. And you feel like at the end he's getting there and then - that's it. It's over. We at least get a good with Eda and Revy at the end. But we never hear of Chinglish or any of the other assassins ever again. And their boss and that other guy on the boat do so little that I don't even remember their names.

Just rent or borrow from a friend first if you're not sure. I think Funimation has it on youtube.  It's not horrible and I don't regret watching it, but if I knew this was all there was, I'd have gotten Future Diary instead.",1480896000,5,1919,4.3314763231197775

5191615,5,B008YRL7JE,"Black Lagoon is a bit of a forgotten gem in the anime world. Sure, it got its (heavily edited) airing on Toonami a while back, but you really have to see the original to appreciate the character arcs and depth of story. This glimpse into the unrepentant underworld through the eyes of an outsider is very well done, with a great voice cast and a no-holds-barred approach to storytelling. Is it over the top at times? Sure, but it doesn't go to the point of extreme stupidity as many other action animes do, and the show is fun throughout.

The title alone should be a clue that this is a mature show, although I suppose the incredibly child-friendly One Piece anime about pirates could cause confusion there. If there is any, BLACK LAGOON IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. Period. Unless you want your children f-bombing every other sentence, chain smoking and waving guns everywhere. Then go ahead and sit down for some quality time around Black Lagoon.

If you're of an appropriate age and enjoy heavy action, fun characters, entertaining stories and occasionally some very dark humor, this one's worth a look.",1471392000,12,1099,4.7486910994764395
5191616,5,B008YRL7JE,"Welcome to Roanapur.  A city of gangsters, crazy women and crazy killer incestial vampire twins.  A city that makes Detroit look like Disneyland. A city where even the Church is corrupt.

Enter Rokuro Okajima who is thrown to the sharks and joins the Black Lagoon, pirates for hire.

This action anime is excellent.  The action is way over-the-top but who really gives a [duck]?  The F bomb is used in every episode and the anime is a benchmark for strong women in the medium that is anime.

It has no grand overarching story; just a bunch of arcs  that last for 3-4 episodes.

The first season focuses on the whole Black Lagoon company: Rock, Revy, Benny and Dutch.  We don't get much characterization for Benny and Dutch; Dutch is a walking black stereotype and Benny is the gadget man.  Revy is a gun-toting trigger-happy muscle of the group and Rock is just a thug-in-training and the innocent one.

Season two (""the second barrage"") shifts attention to just Revy and Rock which is a pity and the reason why season one is better.....a status quo when it comes to anime that has just two seasons.  This doesn't mean the second season is unwatchable just serviceable and why not watch the whole show?  The second season features the crazy killer twins I mentioned earlier in an arc that one could argue is way too dark for a mindless action anime.  The other arcs are fun and just fun action while the twin arc has a backstory that'll make you cry.

It goes without saying that the dub is the very definition of perfection.  The dub is much better than the sub, considering only one character is Japanese....and yes, the Russian chick only uses a Russian accent for  just one scene but who cares about accents?  Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2 is supposed to have a German accent yet he doesn't

This is really not a teen show or anything but I feel that's what help made this series so distinct and gather so much critical acclaim as it shows no censorship for the most part. Also there are two seasons within this collection and you get everything made for this show except the more recent sequel OVA collection called ""Roberta's Blood Trail"" which is just as good I advise to watch this first and then the trail collecton as the trail is the sequels to the last episode shown in this collection.

  It all starts when Rokuro is abandoned by the Japanese corporation he works for when the assignment he is on goes wrong at the crap end of the world.

5191692,5,B008YRL7JE,"The Black Lagoon anime, I hope you enjoy my review!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) Rokuro Okajima was a sales man in Japan for a company called Asahi Industries. One day his employers asked him to deliever a package across the south China seas. When taking the package to its destination by boat, Rokuro's ship gets catured by The Lagoon Trading Company, where they rob him of the package he was sent to deliever and take him hostage. When Rokuro's company hears about the abduction of him they barter to save the package but not him. Telling him they will send flowers to the funeral and telling his family hes dead, Rokuro tells them to forget about him and quits his job at the company and joins his hostage takers crew to become the fourth member of the Lagoon Trading Company. Now known as Rock, he joins Revy the no nonsence gun shooting itchy trigger figer female of the group. Dutch the leader, owner and driver of the Lagoon Company Trading boat, and Benny the tech and mechanic of the group. Now they go around doing different jobs which involve smuggling people, objects, anything, getting the objective from point A to B in one piece and getting paid. But with this high action packed series it is never easy when there is always an open target on your back and guns going off everywhere to do your job right.

Pros: This series completely english dub and sub both in Blu-ray and standard DVDS. The series is completely UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you get all the swears, blood, shooting and tons of other good action. The story line is pretty good. Rock aka Rokuro Okajima is played by Brad Swaile who played Light in the anime series Death Note, and Benny is played by Brian Drummond who was also in Death Note as Ryuk the shinigami so you get to hear their voices again if you are a fan of Death Note.

Cons: If you don't like blood, guns or swearing I would avoid this series, otherwise its amazing

Over all: I loved this series, its fast paced, hardly ever slows down, I say BUY THIS SERIES!!!!",1428710400,2,2016,4.5

5191695,2,B008YRL7JE,"This series was a bit of a let down. It had relatively little plot, the ending was terrible, and it just seemed to drag on for no reason, but Revy (Main character) was bad ass and there were some funny moments. Over all, mediocre.",1428019200,,230,4.25
5191696,4,B008YRL7JE,"Originally written 5-21-10

A walking doormat by the name of Rokuro Okajima is taken hostage by a pirate group named the Lagoon Company. After pretty much proving his worth to the team. He's soon made into a member and renamed Rock. The Lagoon Company is a pirate group that consists of three members. The leader is the African American male Dutch, the computer specialist Benny, and Revy the female loose cannon also known as ""Two Hands"". Rock, whom is clearly a man out of place struggles with his new life as an outlaw. The Lagoon Company's purpose is to transport goods for different entities. The goods range from weapons to kidnapped individuals.-summary

Now without a doubt the action is pretty much what makes this series tick for the most part, and you get plenty of it in the form of high speed chases, both cars and boats, fist fights, and wild exaggerated gun fights. There is no shortage of violence in this series and it definitely looks cool. The high production values by Studio Madhouse provides the necessary eye candy.

The animation can be pretty fluid delivering some of the most entertaining and fast paced gun fights with some beautiful artwork to back it up. Despite some mild inconsistencies with the visuals, they still deliver for the most part. The soundtrack has its moments and the faster paced songs does its job enhancing the action scenes, while others have more of a bland feel that really did nothing for me. The opening theme song is a good dance track called Red Fraction performed by Mell, which opens up the series on a high note. Now as for the languages, well anyone whom claims that the English dub is terrible, or isn't on par with the Japanese sub which is also good just plain has something against English dubs altogether. The English cast steals the show and I'm not the only one whom said it.

Although good for the most part, I did find the action to be somewhat corny at times. Revy whom is the team's designated wrecking crew appears to be way too unstoppable. The brain has to be turned off during some of her action scenes. This isn't exactly a problem since the series aim is to be an over the top action fest anyway, but at times I did roll my eyes. Other characters are later introduced to get in on the action which was very much needed, and most of them are a welcomed addition, in which they help provide some outstanding action scenes on their own. The additional characters are a who's who in coolness, such as the sexy blade wielding Chinese girl Shenhua, and a woman named Roberta who's character is clearly paying homage to The Terminator, so I give the show more credit.

The series is also packed with comedy that is mainly found in the dialogue which contains a lot of profanity and some funny lines. The comedy hits the mark a majority of times. One scene in episode five literally came out of nowhere and is just too damn funny for words. The series first half is pretty much plot less, with mostly all of the episodes either being stand alones or two parters; but there was never a boring moment for me. The latter half of the series is broken into three unrelated chapters.

Black Lagoon is an action series at its core, but it's not completely mindless as it examines existential and atheist themes, which makes a whole lot of sense using them together because the themes are pretty much related. The themes are pushed hard by the two characters Revy and Rock. It works very well between these two distinguishing their characters as polar opposites. I will also add that even though Revy is the muscle here that drives the action. I found Rock to be a lot more interesting because he doesn't come off as an annoying cornball. The biggest problem that I can think of in this series has to be the sudden very dark turn it takes in the second half. Where as in the first half the series appeared to be somewhat light entertainment. The latter half takes itself very seriously and introduces some very dark storytelling with tragic endings. Some viewers may have a problem with the change.

Black Lagoon is a very violent series, with lots of foul language, themes that can offend some, and even some very light sexual situations. I only recommend this series to those whom are not easily offended, and to the die hard action fan. The series is 24 episodes with a 600 minute run time.

Pros: Stylish, well developed main characters, good opening song

Cons: Action scenes can be too cheesy at times, inconsistent artwork, BGM is decent",1427587200,2,4504,4.605985037406484

5191709,5,B008YRL7JE,"Having watched Black Lagoon before, I decided to replace the set that I lost when this complete Blu-Ray Box came available. I can say that I LOVE the series just as much, if not more so, from when I first saw it on DVD several years ago. So, without further ado, here is my review of the anime series Black Lagoon.

A quick note: if you love High School of the Dead (aka HOTD), then Black Lagoon will be up your alley.

Animation

As an avid Otaku, I have noticed that most Japanese Anime seems to fall into two categories. One type is a series with really good, detailed animation; the other is comprised of generic, lazy drawings. Black Lagoon has wonderful animation, and thus falls into the first camp. The details are impeccable, from the environments (which range from a depraved city to the high seas), the mechanical aspects (the gunboat the pirates use is wonderfully drawn and very believable), and to the characters themselves. Each character has a distinct costume, and the facial expressions are varied. While there is a slight tendency for the wide-eyed clich anime females, by-and-large the renderings of the world of Black Lagoon are realistic and believable.

With the above in mind, most of the females are, erm... well endowed, and in some situations, it would be physically impossible for the movement and/or way their endowments are held up (I am sorry, things that large are never that perky). The series does tend to categorize the women into either a highly sexualized depiction (Revy, the main female protagonist in the series, saunters around in a tight tank top and short shorts), or as prude-like as possible (a nun, a businesswoman, or a maid in a very conservative uniform). Even with these somewhat sexist depictions, the personality of these women more than make up for their idealized depictions.

Plot (Minor Spoilers)

The story of Black Lagoon starts out with high-speed action and ends the series with a shootout. The crew of the eponymous Black Lagoon have been tasked with boarding a vessel to obtain certain files from an employee of said Japanese organization. They end up kidnapping the employee, and amid the loud vulgarities uttered by the pirates, the soft-spoken demeanor of the businessman seems comical.

From here, the story takes off. Business intrigue, hectic shootouts, Neo-Nazi subplots, and lots and lots of cursing. The characters themselves are modern-day pirates, acquiring jobs from a variety of sources in their home port, a city filled with the scum of the Earth. The police are corrupt; various cultural gangs (i.e., the Russians, Chinese Triads, Italian Mafia, & etc) are in control. It is the leaders of these gangs who hire the crew of Black Lagoon for myriad illegal jobs.

Now what about that kidnapped Japanese employee? Well, he ends up joining the crew of the Black Lagoon, becoming their straight-laced, book-smart, business negotiations manager. I could tell you how he joins, but it would give away the plot of the first couple episodes.

Some reviews state that there is no discernable plot to the series, and in terms of an overall, arching plot, this statement is somewhat true. The series is comprised of several arcs, with several episodes dedicated toward the exposition and subsequent resolution within the season. These stories build upon the overall development of both the characters and the world of Black Lagoon. The result is a series that is edgy, funny, and full of action. Fights, explosions, chases on the high seas, dark crime stories, and interesting dialogue comprise the series. There are several veiled political comments made (the Neo Nazi plot, for instance, is one), and some vague historical allusions, which may or may not be accurate (I didn't research them, I'll be honest). Some of the plots may offend some people (if you do not like bloodshed and the Neo Nazi depictions, don't get this Blu-Ray), and the series has tons of cursing. I would not recommend watching this in front of children.

Music and Voice Acting

The music in the series is top notch, with maybe the exception of the theme song (a weird rock/techno/J-pop song that makes no sense, lyrics-wise). Most of the action sequences have a rock song playing, and combined with the excellent animation, you will stay glued to your screen. The music suits the atmosphere, and unlike some anime series, fits the content perfectly. I intend to look up the soundtrack!

The voiceacting is wonderful, also. The tones and emotions conveyed by the voiceactors is well done, and the lip-syncing is top-notch. Each character has a very distinct voice, from the rough voice of Revy, the soft-spoken businessman, or the baritone captain. Characters with cultural accents also have excellent portrayals without being clich.

Overall

If you want an action-packed series that is a bit unconventional (there is no grand plot, rather, a series of smaller, defined plots), this is for you. Lots of cursing may turn off some, and some of the touchy subject matter will offend others. The great animation, voiceacting, music, and colorful characters give Black Lagoon a very mature setting and topics that will give you pause. It is brutal and as honest as it can be for a fictional world, and in the end you will be rooting for more. If you love action-packed, dark anime series, Black Lagoon is not one that can be beat.",1424131200,,5367,4.929125138427464
5191710,5,B008YRL7JE,One of the better Anime series out there. Storyline has a lot of Philosophy between the characters on the issues they are dealing with. Lots of killing and the characters seem to survive the impossible; but what do you expect. Those who find the Catholic Church a sacred topic should stay away. It's Anime. My favorite episodes were the Maid To Kill series.,1423699200,,357,4.682539682539683

It doesn't hurt that you get the good ol' dose of ultra-violence.",1423612800,,346,5.142857142857143

5191715,5,B008YRL7JE,"Great series, and the Blu-ray set is great.",1422748800,,43,4.5
5191716,5,B008YRL7JE,"This show has a lot going for it. For starters, the story isn't the usual cliche crap about some mismatched band of renegades saving the world. No, the plot focuses on Lagoon Company, a mercenary/pirate group based out of the fictional city of Roanapur, a fictional crime-filled city in the South China Sea populated by Russian mobsters, Chinese assassins, and all sorts of less than reputable individuals. While it's easy to cheer for the main characters, they too are not saints; they're thieves and killers who don't shed tears about bloodying their hands if it means a good payout. They're well-developed and likable as Hell, but all the same, these guys are criminals.

One of the best things about this show is that there's really no overarching plot. There is some continuity, especially in regards to character development, but there are stories told within four or five episodes and that's it; Lagoon Company counts their losses and moves on. The action is fast and exciting, but it's never too bloody; don't get me wrong, it's a violent show, but nowhere near something like Hellsing. The animation is fluid  and the backdrops are well done and sometimes a treat for the eyes; Roanapur is a tropical paradise after all.

I can't say enough good things about this show. It looks great and it's easily accessible, the characters, though sometimes of questionable morals, are enjoyable and likable, and the story doesn't overstay its welcome. You want to watch a good action anime that's not the usual demon-slaying mecha drama? Look no further than Black Lagoon.",1422662400,,1570,4.961977186311787
5191717,5,B008YRL7JE,This is a great show lots of action swearing and It has a good story. Revy is one of the most bad a$! female anime characters ever.,1422403200,,131,3.888888888888889
5191718,5,B008YRL7JE,"Great animation, terrific action, interesting characters! However, if you cringe at gratuitous violence and filthy language, this is NOT for you. Black Lagoon has some of the most powerful, gritty, dark female characters in anime history. Usually, strong anime females are forced to sacrifice so much for the greater good. These women forge ahead, larger than life, more brash and cut-throat than the males around them. They're not sacrificial lambs; they're forces of nature. They're never objectified or relegated to background eye-candy. And these aren't some pathetic little Thelma and Louise victims of fate/ wannabe badasses. They don't go out in a blaze of glory; they exterminate with precision and very little emotion. There are no crybaby sisterhood rah-rah moments. They just do their job, then go home (or to the Yellow Flag).
Oh, and the guys are pretty good, too. Especially Chang, who is dreadfully under-used.
(Please note: I also love HOTD, so this isn't a feminist rant. BL is just a pleasant change from the usual fan service and harem-themes -- but I like that stuff, too.)",1422230400,4,1093,5.111731843575419

Black Lagoon offers up what some anime lacks: ANIME THAT IS CENTRALLY AIMED FOR ADULT AUDIENCES. This anime does not dote on cute things, in fact, the cute things in this anime are pretty screwed up, and everyone has a shady past. This anime is good for people that are tired of the ""Cutesy"" anime girls w/ some skeletons in the closet, and actually gives you a tomboy with a checkered past from NY!

Think of it as the black market underworld for assassins, spies, traitors, and the worlds most wanted criminals. The show takes the side of all seriousness and leaves only enough room for a good chuckle here and there. Lots of foul language, guns blazing, casings bouncing, insane driving and car crashing stunts to satisfy any action starved junkie to the hilt. Black Lagoon is geared up and aims for an adult audience, but my nine year old son loves it and thinks it is the bomb. ( contains smoking, drinking, cursing, crude humor, blood, and violence.)",1413331200,2,691,4.766666666666667
5191752,4,B008YRL7JE,"The crew of the Black Lagoon are the meanest, most cutthroat smugglers this side of the seven seas.  In an action packed , thrill ride animated by the legendary talents at Studio MADHOUSE.  The edge, and thin line between life and death are crossed every episode.  The crewmates aboard the torpedo boat, make up the residents of the Black Lagoon.  And their courier services don't come cheap. Rei Hiroe's masterful job a creating a world where even the most despicable, and lawless people possess a shred of honor.  But, for the thieves, backstabbers, no good hoodlums, there's a bullet with their name on it.  Rokuro Okamura aka Rock gets his world turned upside down, when the stakes at providing some secret information regarding the company he works for is actually a key player in the arms race.  All his supervisors want is the sensitive information in kept in a safe place.  Unbeknownst, to them when Rock's life is put on the line, our hapless salaryman finds himself in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"".  After learning the truth about his fate, he throws his beliefs and caution to the wind, by siding with his captors!  Rock is introduced to the no holds barred, no nonsense crew of the Black Lagoon.  Revy aka ""Two Hands""  whose proficiency for killing, and near superhuman accuracy with firearms of all sorts is a world unto itself.  ""Dutch"", Captain of the would be crew, can pilot the heck out of the torpedo boat, and lays down the law with his pistol.  Benny, the hacker, the ""brains"" of the outfit, and ""wheelman""  when the crew finds itself in a tight situation.  Rock gets accustomed to this change of pace rather quickly.  I can tell you that the English dub from FUNImation is spot on.  Every character is voiced even better than you would have first guessed. Word to the wise, this show is rated M for a reason.  From the moment you press play, you're going to hear every curse word under the sun.  The English voice actors really flesh out the characters,  Every grunt,  adlibbed word has meaning.  The sound effects are well done to.  Each firearm and explosion chime in, and the surround sound audio, is great too.  The dialogue is crystal clear, and there aren't any choppy layering issues.  The Blu-ray presentation is the better of the two.  Due to the bigger memory capacity,  24 episodes on 3 discs,  as opposed to 4 DVD discs with 6 a piece.  I wish there were more extras in this collection.  I would've loved to hear some bonus commentary on what happened during recordings for the English dub.  Since this was a re-release from the old Geneon, Pioneer recordings it's a piece of history.  My anime collection was pretty thin, back in 2006, so the updated trailers showcasing FUNImation's latest and greatest series are a welcome addition.  For the price, you can' t beat what you're getting.  And as far as the story, it's a psychological, thriller/action series.  There are light pieces of comedy or humor, but nothing that takes away from the plot, or for that matter screams ""typical"" anime.  This the manga animated in all it's glory, and it's something to see.  i don't believe you can look at the episodes and argue for a better presentation.  i hope there working on a 3rd season, since the tenth volume of the manga is currently in print.  The sarcasm, riveting, tension, and pulse pounding action are what makes this show one to watch.",1411430400,,3382,4.67572156196944

5191778,5,B008YRL7JE,"This is my first time reviewing something on Amazon, and I have a tendency to be rather prolix, so bear with me.

I won't go into plot too much, as I believe this is a show worth experiencing in its entirety, but will break down the pros and cons of the series.
Pros:
Action Action and MORE ACTION!!!
Fantastic animation
Appealing characters
Twisted story (if you cant handle it this can be a con)
Unique pace and style

Cons:
Sort of a dude show (more on that later)
Box set feels incomplete (but the OVA, sold separately, finishes up the series nicely)

Pro/Con:
Voice acting is a mixed bag.

Okay, here we go. I have been a big fan of anime all my life, and this has got to be in my top three series watched (and I have seen a LOT of them.) Black Lagoon is unlike any other anime series out there, to the best of my knowledge. It is what I imagine happens when a Japanese man with a fascination for guns and girls writes a manga paying honor to Quentin Tarantino, Clint Eastwood, and the Die Hard series.

At a first glance Black Lagoon is just another Michal Bay film, only animated, complete with subpar acting; but this is how it is supposed to be. You aren't supposed to take the show seriously until it starts taking itself seriously. This can be haphazard at times, but the transition from mindless shoot-em-up to story about the depravity of humanity comes along in a surprising way.

This is a show where you are never more than ten minutes away from a firefight and never more than one minute away from an F bomb; it is clear that this show/manga was geared towards a male audience. However, as there is not a single female cast member who is not a bona fide badass, I would encourage everyone to watch this. It jumps away from the typical anime trope of giddy teenage school girl female characters, and the lead, Revy, is one of the most twisted sociopaths youll ever see.

The animation is amazing, too. From the characters expressions, to the intense detail placed in the action sequences, to the stunning hand-drawn backgrounds and tropical environments. No detail is omitted and you can really appreciate just looking at the scenes. Right out of the bag youll be introduced to amazing ocean environments that will leave you wanting to go to the beach. There is very little CG in this show and, in my opinion, it comes out better for it.

Now Ill mention a little about the story before talking about the most important aspect of this show, the VA. The story starts of bland and un-inspired. Rokuro (Rock) is a Japanese business man whose luck runs out when he is hijacked by a group of international pirates known as Black Lagoon. A thousand bullets, one of those rare helicopter/boat collisions, and a few dozen explosions later nothing really changes aside from the fact that he decides to toss his old job and join up with Black Lagoon.
The series is a collection of Black Lagoons exploits after Rock joins. They are more like mercenaries than traditional pirates and pretty much work for the highest bidder. The story doesnt get really compelling until the second season, Second Barrage, where the stories take a turn for the macabre. By the end of the series you will have that Elfin Lied feeling, where you will be questioning your own humanity and the meaning of life. Until then, though, just enjoy the ride and laugh at the curse words and vulgar behavior.
As I mentioned before the series doesnt feel complete until you watch the OVAs, which is called Black Lagoon: Robertas Blood Trail. The manga which this anime is based off of is still under production, and the second season ended pretty much right when we start learning a little back story. You still won't know much about the cast, except for Revy, by the end of the OVAs but it does feel like a better place to end, slightly more conclusive (though, again, the manga is still going on so we may even get more eventually)

Okay, lastly the Voice Acting. I know a fair amount of Japanese, and am traditionally in favor of Sub over Dub; I can tell good and bad voice acting regardless of language. I have only ever watched one other series where I prefer dub over sub, and that was Samurai Champloo. This show suffers the same fault as that series (or perhaps benefit, depending on how you look at it.) That is: the voice acting isokay? In either language. Ive watched Black Lagoon through in both languages and the quality is decent, but not great, it both languages.

NOW, as to why I prefer Dub over Sub in this instance? One: Watching a show in your native tongue when you have nothing to gain by watching it subbed is always easier. Two, and most importantly: The English language has a much more. Colorful vocabulary. The majority of Black Lagoon (the pirates) is of American origins, and Rock is multi-lingual so everyone speaking English makes more sense. Not to mention it fits the tone of the series more, we Americans have 101 ways to say F you whereas in the Japanese language you are much more restricted. The cast is all pretty violent and vulgar, so having a wide variety in the curse words is a must for comedys sake.

Well that about covers it. A 4.5 star show in my opinion, with only the slightest of faults weighing it down.",1406419200,5,5227,4.520634920634921

5191781,5,B008YRL7JE,"Superb series. How have I not come across this before?

Blu-ray qualities are excellent. I have never had the DVD version, but the BD is crystal clear. No up-conversion problems there.

Highly recommended - purchased this together with the OVA called Roberta's Blood Trail as it is a 6 or 7 episode sorta-kinda sequel/finish to Black Lagoon S1 & S2.

Also purchased this with Jormungand S1 and S2 for one of the best action anime fixes ever. Both titles have superior plot and dialogue compared to many other animes of similar genre.",1405468800,,533,4.771739130434782

5191783,4,B008YRL7JE,"Excellent and brutal anime to add to any collection.  While many stories pull punches and hide behind cute cats and kid-safe emo-battles (I'm guilty of owning and enjoying many such series), Black Lagoon throws you into a dark and violent world filled with rich characters and simple-minded villains alike.  In fact, often the line between villain and hero gets blurred as you discover how messed-up this account of our world is.

If you watch this, be prepared for a mature story with adult themes, violence, dark humor, and an abundance of vulgarities.  And if you're fine with that, you'll probably love it.",1404691200,6,610,4.950980392156863

5191785,2,B008YRL7JE,"The show tries so hard to be deep, but only ends up coming off as obnoxious due to painfully ham fisted writing. Some of the scenarios & action are well done & interesting; but ultimately some of the key characters & their dialog, come off about as deep as the animation itself. The series clearly had potential, but if you've ever seen Cowboy Bebop, then you might get the feeling that the creators of Black Lagoon were trying REALLY hard to outdo that legendary anime. Ultimately Black Lagoon fails to do little more than provide some decent action with a few interesting characters, who are generally more tolerable the less they're on screen. The lead female character Revy is especially obnoxious. I know that my review will be at odds with pretty much every other one here, but given the more narrow appeal of this type of show (eg: anime, violent, mature), it is not out of the realm of possibility that only fans have really reviewed it so far. Do yourself a favor & catch it on Adult Swim for free, before dropping the cash for this Blu-ray.",1404518400,3,1050,4.560846560846561

It is reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, without being a direct copy in a different setting.  Certainly not for young children due to language and violence, but adults who like action and good character interaction should like this.",1403308800,,461,4.4523809523809526
5191791,5,B008YRL7JE,"I received this as a birthday gift from my wife. I had already watched the series so I knew it was great and worth owning.

This set contains both season 1 and season 2 on both types of disc formats. So far this is the full series. It is nice to know whether I am near a blu-ray or a dvd player I will have the right disc for the job.

The series itself is action-packed in the form on gun play, high speed car, boat, helicopter chases etc. Like any other mainstream movie where billions of bullets are flying at any given time with giant explosions and carnage. There is not much nudity, if any in this series. Revy is the main female character and although she can be scantly clad at times, she is generally covered up. Same goes for the other female characters. If you are familiar with anime you this could go either way.

The plot lines are very interesting and realistic paired with good character development and relationship building. The story lines in each episode usually conclude by the end of the short episoeds. I prefer high level story lines where each episode is only 1 small step in the larger plot, but this is not the case with Black Lagoon, however I still love this series.

5191794,5,B008YRL7JE,"Black Lagoon starts with a punch to the face (literally). Rokuro is kidnapped by terrorists from the nigh-lawless city of Roanpur, controlled by Russian mafia empresses, Chinese triad kings and the Cosa Nostra, he is launched into a firestorm of violence, amoral bosses and drug wars on a scale that dwarfs that of Tony Montana and his posse.

Rip-roaring action takes a back seat to heavy philosophy at times, but these conversations are never long and do not detract from the storyline or characters. The first season is split into four arcs, with a one-episode intermission. The second has just three, but they surpass the first season in every way. The content is even more off-the-wall, confronting and impactful than the first. From mentally crippled and abused prepubescent serial killers to a sixteen-year-old girl who inherits a yakuza enterprise, The Second Barrage takes everything that fans loved about season one and piledrived it into a clusterbomb of entertainment. Although I have yet to watch Roberta's Blood Trail, I do have very high expectations for it.",1401667200,,1073,5.131428571428572

The price has gone up from when I bought it, but even at $50.00 it'd be a worthwhile purchase. It's made by the same studio that put together Cowboy Bebop and it shows.

The animation is 5/5, i have no flaws with it at all, its very clean and nice to look at. The plot and character development is 5/5, unlike many shows that you watch the first 5 episodes show you all the back story of all the characters and show you who they are, well not black lagoon with every episode you get one piece of the puzzle into these characters lives and what made them who they are. The story line is very good and violent, if blood, bullets and immorality are your thing then your gonna love this show like i did!

Now for this order itself, its an insane deal! When i ordered this i was under the impression i was getting seasons 1&2 on blu-ray for 26bucks, now for two seasons of a good anime thats dam good. But i was wrong, your not getting just blu-ray your getting seasons 1&2 on DVD AND blu-ray for 26bucks, you literally can't get better then this.

That's all I'm gonna say.  Well, aside from thanking Funimation for re-releasing this.  Heads up: if you want this series GET IT NOW.  The original DVD's were price gouged at $150+ when they went out of print.",1385424000,,444,5.027397260273973

5191830,3,B008YRL7JE,"Black Lagoon is an action drama anime based off the manga of the same name by Rei Hiroe and it is incredibly violent and vulgar, much like the live action films by such individuals as Quentin Tarantino and John Woo, of which this series is clearly inspired. It was animated by the studio Madhouse and like many Madhouse productions, the quality of the animation and sound is outstanding. This is, at least from a visual standpoint, a very beautiful series. The action sequences are slick and stylish, if not a bit derivative, and the sound effects and voice work, especially in the dub, is stellar. Unfortunately, the aspects of this series that keep it from achieving a five star rating is due to the explicitly vulgar language and excessive violence and gore, as well as several of the characters, especially one who is a part of the ""main"" cast, Revy. I'm not entirely sure what the hell Rei Hiroe was thinking when he created her character, but he made a huge mistake making her a mentally unstable psychopath who delights in killing and hurting others. Now, her character wouldn't be such a problem if she was a villain or an antagonist, but the fact that we're supposed to sympathize with this creature is beyond my understanding, yeah she had a tough childhood, so what, lot's of people have had bad childhoods and don't turn out like her, and obviously few or no people were born bad were they? Most real life criminals and monsters like Richard Kuklinski and Charles Manson had tough childhoods, but that doesn't mean they're completely innocent and can't be held accountable for their actions. But Revy with her constant outbursts and violent nature is a complete turnoff for me, she isn't sexy or sympathetic, and if Rei Hiroe wanted to make Black Lagoon a better series he should have made her more like Dutch, a tough military badass but still genuinely likable. She could have been a war veteran like Balalaika but still retaining enough compassion and honor to be relatable to ""normal"" people. It's really quite a shame, because all of the other main characters, especially Rock and Benny, while not the most likable characters in the world, are still awesome in their own way. 3 stars for the aforementioned positives!",1383004800,9,2234,4.790155440414508
5191831,4,B008YRL7JE,"Okay, I'm not going to give a summary of the anime - it's my favorite anime of all time, I love it so much. The problem, was the actual box of the anime. It comes in a very thin cover box, with the dvd/bluray box inside. The outside cover easily bends and folds, and it was pretty torn up when it arrived at my house. The box itself has the same picture as the cover, with a thin plastic sheet over it. The plastic sheet continuously gets caught while trying to put it back into the cover box, and it bends and folds - making the box look terrible. I'm all about my anime looking as presentable as possible, especially if it's my all time favorite anime. Sadly, it sits on the shelf, looking a bit shabby, and that's disappointing.

The city is ruled by mafias of various types but mainly by the Russians. The stories are complex and well thought out and a darkness pervades this work  to its benefit. The characters take a little time to gel and Revy, Dutch, Rock, and Benny plus the former Russian soldier Lady Balalaika are balanced by an excellent supporting cast of worthies and weirdos. The incedentla music isn't the cohesive masterpiece of Bepop but Red Fraction by MELL is an epic song. This is what Gantz could have been but wasn't.

So, I'll review the packaging. It's all very secure and well made, but the seventh disc (placed on the inside of the back cover, unlike the other six discs, which are placed in a 'page' of discs) always pops out when I open it. And the rest of the discs are difficult to take out, because the securing 'thing' in the middle is really tight. I figured out you have to bring up the 'page it's stored on and then press on the middle, and it comes out quite easily. Without doing that though, you have to bend the disc a lot (seemed like it would break the first time I tried to take it out! But it didn't).",1381190400,,842,4.197530864197531

5191877,5,B008YRL7JE,"Black Lagoon is simply one of the most unique and interesting anime I have experienced in a long time. Without giving any spoilers, here's my review of Black Lagoon.
Package: There isn't much to talk about here, the Blu-rays and the DVDs fit nicely and you don't have to worry about them falling out of the case. There are a fair amount of special features, including a ""behind the scenes"" which anime releases NEED more of.
Plot: The plot and characters are the best part about this anime, creating a world that feels real. The series follows former white-collar business man Rock as he gets involved in the criminal underworld. The way each character acts seems completely natural, and you will become attached to every character in the show on some level. Now, despite all the good in the story, it ends with a very ""READ THE MANGA"" ending. Even so, it's not at soul-crushing levels so I can forgive it.
Sound: The music in this series isn't really anything special, but it fits what is happening on-screen. The dub is fantastic, and makes more sense since only one recurring character in the show is actually Japanese. The opening is really good and memorable, but the same can't be said about the ending theme.
Animation: The animation looks really good, especially for the time it came out. It's a treat to watch on Blu-Ray. The fight scenes are hit and miss, sometimes intense, sometimes underwhelming.
Overall: I love this series, the characters and their stories are so well written and memorable, and the english voice actors are perfect for their characters. While the combat scenes aren't always all that great, the positives outweigh the negatives.",1371254400,,1661,4.831578947368421

5191889,5,B008YRL7JE,If you like this anime and didn't buy it at this price then you are just crazy!!!! Cause this is an amazing price and way to hard to pass up!!!!,1368316800,,144,3.8333333333333335

5191891,5,B008YRL7JE,"Black Lagoon centres around the adventures of a group of modern day pirates known as the Black Lagoon. Their members consist of Revy; an aggressive, attractive and volatile young woman, whose skills with her guns earn her the nickname "" Two Hands"". Then there is Rock, who is brave, good with people and not afraid to stand up for himself. Next is Benny, who is a techno head from America. Finally, we have Dutch; a physically imposing character whose personality doesn't seem what you'd expect at first glance; he is calm, cool, collected and handles the running of the group. They're all memorable in their own way, both in character design and personality, and are one of the main reasons Black Lagoon is such an enjoyable show. The plot revolves around miniature 2 to 3 episode arcs that are unconnected for the first 14 episodes before a more large reaching plot for the final ten episodes. Fortunately, this format ensures things are never dull and the events that occur are highly entertaining, and occasionaly, even touching. From smuggling guns or searching for treasure at the bottom of the ocean, to being chased by a gun wielding crazy Spanish maid; it's all in a days work for the Black Lagoon crew.

This boxset contains episodes 1 - 24 but not the OVAS Robertas blood trail, which is sure to get a separate release. Nevertheless, this Blu Ray is an excellent bargain, particularaly for first time viewers who may have been put off by the DVD prices. The picture quality is fantasic, and though I haven't seen the DVD version, I imagine it can't have looked this good: it's sharp, clear, bright and is one of the first things you'll notice upon watching. It looks great.

The sound on the other hand isn't amazing, but the voice acting is of high standard no matter which dub you listen to. The music, whilst nothing memorable is suitable to the scenes it is played in and the series as a whole. Whether it's an intense shoot - out, a car chase or just the crew taking it easy - the soundtrack has it covered whilst never being distracting. It also has a great ending song that makes an excellent fadeout at the end of episodes called "" Don't look behind"" by Edison.

It's easy to recommend Black Lagoon to action enthusiasts as it covers that side of things effortlessly, however, this can also be recommended to those who are looking for a series with a great cast of characters who are surprisingly well developed for an action series, whilst also providing strong drama to accompany the action. If this is what you seek than look no further than Black Lagoon.",1367884800,,2577,4.646929824561403
5191892,5,B008YRL7JE,This series was fantastic! It was filled with action and was a more mature anime. The characters were well developed and one of them is over the top slinging her two handed guns. There are some funny parts about nuns. You will just have to watch it. I am an anime collector and am proud to have this series in my collection. So glad both series one and two were on this amazing blu-ray. Get it now before the price goes up. You won't be disappointed.,1367798400,,450,4.244186046511628

Great characters, interesting plot twists, memorable action sequences, hilarious lines, profanity, incest -- it's all here.

Not going to review the show, not the place for it here. The dub was amusing at least, though not on par with the Japanese dub, as rings true with most shows.

In hindsight, would I buy it, probably not.

Edit: Just though I'd add that I find it amusing that advice concering the quality of the box is deemed unhelpful. Oh well.",1367107200,7,569,4.201834862385321
5191897,5,B008YRL7JE,This anime was excellent and should be any anime lovers collection. The show is pure action with a great flowing story line that leaves the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. Any anime lover should really consider purchasing this show.,1366934400,,236,4.780487804878049
5191898,5,B008YRL7JE,"I ended up watching this anime on a whim, and boy was I surprised. I give it a 5 because it doesn't deserve to have a ruined perfect rating, THOUGH, it is not the #1 anime out there. Just a couple quick examples of my pet-peeves:

-During the countless shootouts, 100's of bullets are dodged by simply running sideways.

-This series portrays characters all over the world. It's a nice touch when the cast voices in the proper accent too! But when Balalaika has a russian accent for one episode and then a english one for the rest of the series, it's a little dissapointing.

That being said, these minor downfalls were easily drowned out by the story and character development. The main protagonist was still someone who didn't fit in his environment, but nowhere near as dull/gullible/dum as other series. It's a setting based on a real mercenary org. in South America, so behind the scenes research and character diversity is freaking amazing! It's rare to find myself rooting for all these characters that naturally conflict with each other, and gives you that much more a sense of sadness/torn judgement/excitment when those characters' stories rise and fall.

Also, I use a little internal system to rate shows; If a show makes me ""gasp"" it is definitely worth owning. When I say gasp, I'm not talking an ""Oh Wow"" or ""Aawww"" or ""NOooo"", but a ""Oh my lanta, No F-----g way!"". This show definitely has a ""gasp"" moment.

The last disatisfier of this series is the ending. The fact that the characters are so likable, and the story so action-packed, makes a regular ""season ending"" a no-go. This wasn't even that; literaly comparable to an ending of a random episode in mid-season. I wanted at least some closure for a season ending...

STILL WORTH IT!

5191900,5,B008YRL7JE,"I picked this combo up for the series because I had seen it before and loved it but I thought that the price for the dvd's were a bit high.

I love the fact that it is on both formats (which I did not even realize when I purchased it) and the fact that it is in the slim style case is nice because it does not take up a ton of space.

The only complaint that I have is that it is called ""Compete set"" when it technically is not if you count the OVA ""Black Lagoon:  Rebertas blood trial"" but I knew this ahead of time because I read that it was season 1 and 2 so I cant take away from the score.

now this is not an anime for everyone, it has lots of foul language, sexual references, and enough violence to rank up there with a Quentin Tarantino film.  And considering the artist of the original manga has stated that he got allot of influence from  Tarantino, John Woo, and The Wachowski Brothers.",1366329600,,898,4.01685393258427

Overall Rating 3.5/5
If youve seen a trailer watch one now if you havent. you can tell it looks a bit like a Cowboy Bebop clone set in the south Asia seas or whatever they say in the show.

But the lead guy isn't some badace bounty hunter, hes an office worker that roped in purely by chance. If you buy and like this, be sure to buy Cowboy Bebop too if you haven't already. Its very similar but was made long before and is set in space.  Anyhow, this show mainly presents stories as multi-episode arcs.  Here a group of mercenaries complete odd jobs while getting into some of the craziest gun fights youll probably ever see, nuff said.

Theme Songs 1/5
This series openings are English I don't like English openings to anime.  The ending themes are the slow and not great. Remote skip function don't fail me now
