8645055,1,B00ISK98IO,"HORRIBLE DATED documentary on the history of Irish Dance. There was very, very, very little dancing and no instruction on the basics. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money. It'd be more entertaining to throw your money out the window and see where the wind takes it!",1489622400,,275,4.52
8645056,2,B00ISK98IO,"I was disappointed. I hoped to see traditional Irish dancing as opposed to the usual commercial ""Riverdance"" style but there was very little actual dancing and too much talking (history?). The small amount of dancing was very good and a nice change but there just wasn't much of it.",1458518400,2,282,4.775510204081633
8645057,5,B00ISK98IO,A delightful experience with some great dancing and the story behind the mystique of Irish dancing. I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan or wants to learn more about this unique cultural tradition.,1431475200,,206,4.75
