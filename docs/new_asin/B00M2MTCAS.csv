6554346,2,B00M2MTCAS,"Northpole did not impress me. So much hype for a silly movie. If you want to watch it before buying, I would suggest that as an option. One viewing is plenty and once you see the movie, you will understand!",1416614400,,206,4.175
6554347,5,B00M2MTCAS,In the movie Northpole it is about a 10 year old boy named Kevin (Max Charles) who just moved from Wisconsin.  Kevin is having a hard time making new friends in his new town.  Kevin meets a young girl named Clementine (Bailee Madison) contacts Kevin from a Northpole communicator. Clementine lives in a town called Northpole. Northpole is in trouble because down south the mayor in Kevin's new town decided not to have a tree light ceremony this year. Kevin's mom Chelsea (Tiffani Thiessen) is a journalist for a newpaper. Chelsea is assigned a story about why not have a tree light ceremony.  Clementine ask Kevin to save her hometown Northpole. Watch this movie to see if Clementine and Kevin can save Christmas or not.,1416528000,7,721,4.752
6554348,4,B00M2MTCAS,"Hallmark is The Boss when it comes to putting out holiday family flicks, and hush all ye jaded who roll their eyes because they think it's too soon, too soon. I and my fam had tremendous fun watching NORTHPOLE, fourth of twelve films in Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas campaign for 2014.

Having the very likable Bailee Madison onscreen is a surefire way for the film to score a win in my household. She plays impulsive young elf Clementine who may be 13 years old... or 13 decades old. She dwells in Northpole (est. 1820), Santa's village what's shaped like a snowflake. If you remember your fancy science schooling, you're aware that the Northern Lights are made up of sparks of happiness derived from the children's holiday cheer. These sparks float down as magic snowflakes that elves then use to create toys for the children's merriment. This cycle of happiness is what powers the village.

But, oh, no, Christmas is in serious trouble! And oh, no, mild ***SPOILERS*** alert for these next two paragraphs. Today, cynicism holds sway. Down south there is less togetherness, and ominous signs abound. The Northern Lights flicker alarmingly. Assembly lines have slowed, with elves muttering that this year there may not be enough toys to spread around. Clementine digests all this and sets out to remedy things. She'll need help. She grabs that North Pole communicator, snatches Santa's flying reindeer Randy (but leaves a note: ""Santa IOU 1 reindeer"").

10-year-old Kevin Hastings (Max Charles), fresh off Wisconsin, is having an awful time adjusting to his new town. He hasn't made friends in school. No one's joined his committee to string up Christmas lights. And he gets laughed at when he declares his school project is to reinvigorate the Christmas spirit by saving the town's annual Christmas tree lighting from cancellation. Even Kevin's single mom, Chelsea (Tiffani Amber Thiessen), is skeptical. But, then again, she's working thru her own issues. She's the newest journalist for the local paper, the Daily Examiner, and she's beentasked with a thorny assignment: finding out what's behind the decision to cancel the Christmas tree lighting, a century-old tradition. The mayor and the land developer are staying mum. But then Kevin gets a present left at his doorstep: a North Pole communicator.

My guess is that NORTHPOLE ends up being a holiday fixture on the Hallmark Channel. I mean, there's already a sequel projected for Christmastime, 2015. Given, the plot, it's not much. But the CG visual effects are really cool - the aerial perspective of the Northpole village looks amazing. The cast is super likable, and that counts for a lot. One character I haven't even mentioned is Kevin's teacher, Ryan Wilson (Josh Hopkins). The best teachers are those whose creative techniques allow their students to look at things differently, and Ryan is that. I liked his method for teaching fractions, and I imagine his classroom must be a really fun place to be in. Ryan ends up mentoring Kevin thru his daunting school project. As an added treat, veteran actors Robert Wagner and Jill St. John play Santa and Mrs. Claus. And if you're an American Idol-head, past winner Candice Glover has a minor role and sings two Christmas songs and even advances the plot. I recommend this movie for its cast and for being a wholesome movie the entire family can relish and for its cautionary lesson on the perils of making kneejerk assumptions.

When the holiday season comes around, Hallmark is my go-to channel. I can't pimp it enough. With that in mind and for those who like to sneak in that holiday spirit early, here's the line-up for Hallmark's 2014 Countdown to Christmas (lifted from their website):

1) One Starry Christmas (aired Saturday, November 1, starring Sarah Carter, Damon Runyan) - An aspiring astronomy professor finds unexpected Christmas romance when she meets a charming cowboy during her holiday travel. As she decides between this new cowboy and her practical boyfriend, she must decide whether it's better to play it safe in love, or let an adventurous cowboy steal her heart.

2) The Nine Lives of Christmas (aired Saturday, November 8, starring Brandon Routh, Kimberley Sustad) - With Christmas approaching, a handsome fireman afraid of commitment adopts a stray cat and meets a beautiful veterinary student who challenges his decision to remain a confirmed bachelor.

3) A Cookie Cutter Christmas (aired Sunday, November 9, starring Erin Krakow, Alan Thicke, David Haydn-Jones) - Two longtime rivals and elementary school teachers duke it out during the holidays in a Christmas cookie bake-off, but their real feud ignites over a shared interest in a handsome single dad. With both determined to win the prize and the romance, their competitiveness could jeopardize what matters most this Christmas season.

4) Northpole (aired Saturday, November 15, starring Tiffani Thiessen, Josh Hopkins, Bailee Madison)

5) Angels and Ornaments (aired Sunday, November 16, starring Jessalyn Gilsig, Sergio Di Zio) - Corrine's holiday season gets an unexpected dose of romance when she meets the mysterious Harold, who is on a deadline from a higher power to help Corrine find her true love by Christmas Eve. As the clock ticks down to Harold's deadline, Corrine must decide if she will open up to Christmas love.

6) A Royal Christmas (airs Saturday, November 22, starring Lacey Chabert, Jane Seymour, Stephen Hagan) - A young working girl with a blue-collar background is surprised when her new fianc announces he is actually a prince of a small sovereign country in Europe. After the couple quickly takes off to spend the holidays at his family's sprawling, royal castle, she must work hard to win over her disapproving and unaccepting future mother-in-law--the Queen--and find out if love truly can conquer all.

7) The Christmas Shepherd (airs Sunday, November 23, starring Teri Polo, Martin Cummins) - A successful children's book author and Army widow loses her late husband's German Shepherd, Buddy, only to later find him adopted by a new family - a single father and his daughter. Each finds a sense of Christmas spirit as they struggle to decide with whom the dog really belongs.

8) Christmas Under Wraps (airs Saturday, November 29, starring Candace Cameron Bure) - When a driven doctor doesn't get the prestigious position she planned for, she unexpectedly finds herself moving to a remote Alaskan town. While she meets the locals and even starts a new romance, she has to learn to let the life she planned for give way to a love she never could have imagined, and finds this festive small town is hiding one big holiday secret.

9) Debbie Macomber's Mr. Miracle (airs Saturday, December 6, starring Rob Morrow, Michelle Harrison) - Heavenly angel Harry Mills is sent to Earth on a trial assignment to intervene in the life of a woman who needs help getting her life on track after the death of her father. With a deadline of Christmas day, he attempts to help her heal in order to embrace a new future, and an unexpected love, just in time to celebrate the miracle of the holiday season.

10) Christmas at Cartwright's (airs Sunday, December 7, starring Alicia Witt, Wallace Shawn ) - With Christmas approaching, a struggling single mom finds herself working as a department store Santa Claus, as a real-life angel delivers good fortune and the possibility of holiday romance.

11) Best Christmas Party Ever (airs Saturday, December 13, starring Torrey DeVitto, Steve Lund) - With the holidays approaching, a young party planner arranges a special Christmas party for a New York toy store. When a powerful corporation threatens to shut her down, she decides to follow her heart, moving forward with the party plans and finding true love in time for Christmas.

12) The Christmas Parade (airs Sunday, December 14, starring AnnaLynne McCord, Jefferson Brown) - A popular network morning host finds herself humiliated on the air by her fianc and disappears to a small town. While there, she helps a budding artist save a community art center for the town's kids, by helping them with their float for the annual Christmas Parade.",1416355200,19,8156,5.025166543301259
6554349,2,B00M2MTCAS,"Our family always looks forward to new Hallmark movie releases especially their Christmas movies.  However this movie was a bust in the opinion of all as we watched its' premier on 15 Nov 2014 on The Hallmark Channel.  The story line was all over the place making it difficult to follow and there was about as much on screen chemistry between Tiffani Thiessen and Josh Hopkins as two sticks of firewood.  The young actors, Max Hopkins and Bailee Madison, were the only saving grace in the movie.  And as with ALL of the Levinson Production efforts, the almost non-stop background music was so loud at times that it nearly drowned out the conversation entirely.  Why do they think they have to add that awful loud music to all movies produced by that company?  I sure don't have loud background music playing when having a conversation with someone.  Wish enough people would complain to Levison & company that they would drop the music.  They do the same thing on the T.V. series ""Cedar Cove"".  Sure hope they don't do the same to the new Good Witch series coming to T.V. early next year!  Anyways, back to this particular movie.  Glad I didn't pre-order the thing.  Would have been a waste of my money.",1416268800,5,1203,4.622641509433962

As this movie would have it, the Northpole is a CGI wonder in the shape of a snowflake.  Its powered by magic but apparently, the magic of holiday happiness around the world is dimming like the dead bulbs on a forest of CGI Christmas trees.  The effect of this is seen in the northern lights.  The only people who can repair this is a single mom (Tiffani Thiessen), her son Kevin (Max Charles), Kevins teacher (Josh Hopkins), and a very tall elf named Clementine (Bailee Madison).  Thats right, Christmas and Santa will be lost if these people cant amp up Christmas cheer in their crabby little town in the middle of nowhere USA.  Lighting a Christmas tree figures heavily in the plot as does an old letter to Santa.

The most disturbing aspect of this story is Santas tracking system that keeps tabs on all of us.  Im almost certain that violates our civil liberties.

This movie is so gosh-darn cute and............sweet.  Its impossible not to like it on some level.  Goodness knows I tried!",1449964800,4,1079,4.6861702127659575

6554449,5,B00M2MTCAS,This Christmas movie is very uplifting. The Spirit of Christmas is going downhill and an elf decides to do something about it. She hears and sees a little boy having a hard time at school and the elf comes and they become friends and the Spirit of Christmas gets a lot brighter with work and help from other people. Mr. and Mrs. Claus are Happy that there elf brought the Spirit of Christmas back. I'm looking forward for Northpole 2 which will be on the Hallmark Channel this Christmas 2015. It's a Powerful Christmas Movie with a lot of heart and some sadness and happiness.,1429660800,7,576,4.495238095238095

As I write this, five folks rate it less than 3-stars. I,
who believe in myself---almost as much as Santa---
found the leads:
* Tiffani Thiessen
* Josh Hopkins
* Bailee Madison
The sequel is available: ""NORTHPOLE: Open for something-or-another.""
...to be delightful!

Ignore the nay-sayers. A 2015 sequel is promised...
little Bailee Madison is out-growing her ""Shirley Temple""
roles---and is sure to find romance, soon---but, she
SURE makes a cute elf while she's 13 or 14!

Merry Christmas to those of us that BELIEVE... in the
reason for the season... ELVES; Santa; and Ms Madison!",1418342400,11,634,5.086538461538462

6554527,5,B00M2MTCAS,"Very entertaining!  Bailee Madison was an excellent choice for the part of Clementine. I wonder, however, about the choice of Robert Wagner and Jill St. John as M/M Claus - hired perhaps for their name recognition, but not very convincing for their roles. Tiffani Thiessen did a great job as ""mom."" She communicates thoughts and emotions very well via her facial expressions; one sign of a good actor.

6554535,2,B00M2MTCAS,"This is not really a movie for kids.  The magical North Pole is shown for like 5 min and then the rest of the movie is a typical Hallmark movie love story for Tiffani Amber Theissen.  So it bores kids.  The love story isn't interesting to adults because it has kid elements thrown in, so the movie falls completely flat for everyone.
Cute cameos, the North Pole set was really great,  I wish more time was spent there, and not on Tiffani and the movie would have been a big hit.  Disappointing.  Glad we watched for free on the Hallmark channel.  I would have been bummed to have paid for it.  On another positive note, this is the first movie my children ever fell asleep to, so I got to put them in bed by 730pm!  Thanks Hallmark!",1416960000,6,732,4.246376811594203

6554537,5,B00M2MTCAS,This is a good not to mention funny Christmas movie. One of the stars is Tiffini Amber Thieson of Saved By the Bell fame but thats beside the point. The girl from Saved By the Bell plays a single mom whos ten year old son gets involved with an elf  to save the North Pole. Eventually they bring this kids overprotective  mom who decides to play along with what she thinks is a fantasy and one of his teachers-who  has romantic feelings for the mom-in on the plan.

Sappy story, nothing exciting and the acting was horrible from the first word to the end. No one likes every Hallmark holiday movie, but this was the worst I've ever seen. There's only so many story lines one can write for family and romance, we've seen the same ones over and over.
