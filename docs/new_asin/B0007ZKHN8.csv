8054846,5,B0007ZKHN8,"Great DVD, instruction is a little fast though the need to pause and back up is necessary. I still really enjoy learning the techniques though and plan on passing them on to my students as I get more proficient.",1489190400,,211,4.435897435897436
8054847,5,B0007ZKHN8,The Ssang Bong DVD is a bit of an old style of instructional video but it's worth buying. It's a part of Korean weaponry arts which are not taught anymore. A must buy for any Martial artist studying Korean weaponry.,1459209600,,215,4.4

8054849,5,B0007ZKHN8,Great....so organized...redundancy is perfect and adds slow movement. Master kim has the best videos I have ever seen,1431648000,,117,5.555555555555555
8054850,5,B0007ZKHN8,"This is a step-by-step approach to Korean double-stick combat.  It is very basic and easy to follow.  If you are into Tae Kwon Do, this style compliments the approach nicely.  As a fan of the Filipino fighting arts, I can appreciate this style.  It is obviously a prelude to working with bladed weapons.  The instruction is clear and lends itself to repetition for mastery.  Give it a look with sticks in hand so you can get the most out of it.",1430611200,2,444,4.419753086419753
8054851,5,B0007ZKHN8,I have the whole stick collection this is an awesome collection a must have for the serous Martial Artist.,1425081600,,106,4.631578947368421
8054852,3,B0007ZKHN8,"There is less emphasis on individual techniques applied against opponents on this disc-- I mean less than Sang Kim's previous single stick fighting DVD's
But, I am definitely a fan of Sang Kim's other discs. His open hand fighting disc and those beginner and intermediate stick fighting discs are awesome. They are full of applications for real fights-- things you could practice with a partner to learn real self defense. As far as I am concerned, this disc is good but Mr. Kim's other discs are very great.",1335830400,,508,4.784090909090909
8054853,3,B0007ZKHN8,"While this dvd focuses on double stick fighting, there are differences in the over all techniques that one may be familiar with. 1. The patterns (stepping) seem more linear than circular. 2. The reverse grip is unusual but may be a bit difficult to pull off and maintain during a fast skirmish. 3. The attack drills are ""one step."" However, the exercises and stances are very viable. The explanation of power and twisting are clear.  As with all Turtle Press products, the menus are very helpful and easy to navigate. If you have a working knowledge of stick fighting, this dvd may be able to supplement your technique.",1187136000,4,619,4.731481481481482
8054854,5,B0007ZKHN8,For those uncomfortable or new to stick fighting this is a great bridge for karate and tae kwon do people into Filipino martial arts.,1185753600,3,133,4.583333333333333
