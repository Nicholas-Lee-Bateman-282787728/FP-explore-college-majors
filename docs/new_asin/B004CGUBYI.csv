4327123,4,B004CGUBYI,"This movie is everything a horror film is supposed to be: tons of gore, a hot young cast (most of which can't act all that well), and a host of veteran actors (Brad Dourif, Keith David, Betsy Russell, etc) making appearances.

From the title, you have probably gathered a bit about the plot. There is a chain letter targeting a technology-obsessed group of teens. They have to pass it on or a psychopathic killer mangles them in a most creative way.

A combination of ""The Ring"" and ""Stay Alive,"" this movie avoids the excess torture of the ""Saw"" films, as well as the long drawn out storylines of other films of this nature. It's just a good time. There is nothing stunning or original about the film that will make it stick in your memory forever, but it satisfies the horror film lover's appetite for lots of gore, a little nudity, and an overall great time.",1296691200,8,861,4.512820512820513

4327125,3,B004CGUBYI,"After receiving an e-mail chain letter a group of friends start to realize this one is no joke.  After receiving an e-mail saying send this to 5 people or you will die Jesse Campbell (Reed) sends it from her brothers computer.  Like most of us, her friends delete it, but soon find out that was a mistake.  There is a scene in the first few minutes that talks about everyone being on the internet and haveing a cell phone, (everyone can get in contact with everyone at anytime), this leads to the chain letter being sent, because no one can avoid it.  I liked the idea of the movie, but it could have been so much better.  I would compare this to a ""Final Destination"" movie.  A group of kids start getting killed off one by one in various ways after one event affects them all.  ""Final Destination"" did pull off the idea way better.  Not a bad movie but don't expect ""Saw"" gore.  I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - Nope",1296345600,,925,4.234285714285714
4327126,5,B004CGUBYI,"Props to director Deon Taylor for putting his reputation on the line with ""Chain Letter,"" (about a chain letter) to expose J-horror darling ""Ringu"" for the unimaginative sham it is and always has been.

Because a chain letter on videocasette is still a chain letter. What is a VCR tape anyway? Is that like an 8-track, but significantly larger?

Speaking of phones, Taylor co-directed ""Dead Tone,"" about a prank call dialed to the wrong dude. The movie poster for that groundbreaking 2007 film featured a corded phone dripping blood against what looks like a really rusty fridge. I don't know why a phone would have a cord attached to it. Is that supposed to symbolize a phone in a noose? Would that scare me?

Such a simple thing, really, chain letters. They probe us at our deepest, basest core -- our beastly underpinnings that yank your head by the temples every time some idiot thinks that turning on his left blinker means he can just COME ON OVER into my lane!

Chain letters are the most rudimentary form of terrorism. They're totally random, uncertain, conducted by simple means, spread like a virus.

""Chain Letter"" is an allegory of America's obsession with ""the latest thing,"" perhaps as some passive-aggressive form of trying to win friends. Either that, or it is a love letter to the nigh-viral libido pulsating within our sheep mentality. (After all, bestiality IS the new taboo.)

But above all, ""Chain Letter,"" is a horrible film. It is, at heart, an artistic rebellion against good ideas. It's called making a statement. It's what artists do. You don't bend like a newborn twig every time some wrinkly, leaking big-wig wheels out a barrel of cash and a busload of prostitutes.

Even if it turns out I'm wrong, bravo, I say to you, dear Deon ....

4327135,1,B004CGUBYI,"Chain Letter does nothing in its first twenty minutes to distinguish itself from any other b-list horror film. It hits viewers with a few weak jump scares, all of the ""teen"" characters are clearly in their 20s, and it attempts to take an un-scary concept and make it terrifying.

The concept in question is none other than the goofy chain email that threatens anyone who fails to forward it with certain death. Those people who grew up in the Age of Technology have probably received a couple dozen poorly written ones over the years- there's the one about the babysitter, the one about the serial killer, the one about... you get the idea. They're usually not very clever.

Naturally, plenty of the high school students in Chain Letter who receive the threatening email discard it with disdain (much like I did in high school), and the massacre ensues. Students who ignore the email start dying in gruesome fashion. The killer's weapon of choice is, of course, a CHAIN. (Ha ha, get it? They didn't pass the CHAIN email, so he kills them with a CHAIN. Unbelievably clever.)

If my obvious disdain for the film strikes the reader as a bit harsh, allow me to highlight some of its other transgressions.

First, even though each recipient is required to forward the email to five other people, nobody ever receives it twice. Preposterous! When I received these stupid things from classmates I would usually get them from all directions, which made it very tempting to reply to each sender with a malicious comment like ""I hope you die!"" or ""The joke is on you, fool; I'm the killer!""

Second, even though the chain email in the film presumably makes it to hundreds of people the first night it's in circulation, it takes over THREE DAYS for a second recipient to end up dead. The film also fails to address the uncomfortable fact that people living in other towns, cities, and states have surely received the email but are NOT being killed.

Third, Chain Letter attempts (and fails) to make a profound statement about technology's adverse effects on modern society. Setting aside the fact that a slasher flick is not the appropriate medium for such a serious statement, I would also like to point out that this particular wannabe-horror-film never fully explores the idea. Thus, every time the idea reemerges (""The killer must hate technology!"" - ""But he uses technology!"" - ""...It doesn't matter!"") it feels confusing and forced.

Additionally, the dialogue is contrived, the acting ranges from ""poor"" to ""laugh-out-loud bad,"" and every horror clich imaginable shows up in one form or another. It doesn't even look pretty since the filmmakers neglected to use top-tier equipment.

I could go into much greater detail about all of Chain Letter's faults, the greatest of which might be that it actually expects its audience to take it seriously (as opposed to campy slasher flicks that embrace their own unintentional comedy), but there is no reason to flog a dead horse. Chain Letter was doomed before it started; with such a stupid concept, there was never a scary movie to be made of it. No sense wasting your time on this one, folks.",1421452800,2,3133,4.82122905027933

4327138,3,B004CGUBYI,"Chain Letter is only scary for people who are taken aback or feel concerned whenever they receive messages through email or facebook that say ""Send this to 10 other people or else!""  Some people actually feel uncomfortable and fear the consequences unless they send it to 10 other people.  I know crazy right!  That's basically what a chain letter is, and what makes up the plotline to this ""horror"".

Now I'm willing to give this movie a little bit of a break because despite the bottom of the barrel choice for a plot that's way too typical of the modern age we live in grasping for anything to wrap a movie around, there actually ARE a few decent moments in Chain Letter.  I enjoy the death of a person chained to the back of two cars, so when the cars drive down the road the person chained gets smacked around experiencing bumps and bruises in graphic fashion.  This is especially thrilling when the lady in the right car looks in the mirror while stopping at a red light and realizes there's a body attached to the back of her car but... she can't warn the guy in the other car in time as he speeds off so yeah, that poor body, haha.  For additional effect maybe they should have filmed these particular scenes somewhere in Pennsylvania, har har!  In case you don't know, PA has some extremely bumpy roads.  Would have been ideal I tell ya!

Anyway the other deaths involving a girl rather realistically dying after a spear goes through her head is pretty cool, as is the one where the teenage boy gets his face ripped apart by a chain tightening across his face.  I can't even imagine what it would feel like to have a chain smash my face in such a way.  Maybe these deaths aren't original at all but I've never seen them before in other films so for now I'll consider them nice moments of creativity.  How about that guys head who gets squashed like a supersized bug while looking at his car motor, haha.  Blood just dunks out of his head like a giant bin of red pudding.

Otherwise the storyline is just really bad.  The acting is below average (the brother and sister arguing over a computer with childish insults is plain writing) and the cop detective going around figuring out clues wasn't a good actor either and seemed somewhat arrogant and inappropriate for his role.  Lousy acting all around by everybody.  Only the deaths can save this one.  It's passable only for the deaths, but please, if you know what a chain letter is and have received them online, you'll probably end up mocking or flat out disliking the choice to base an entire script around the subject.  It's just not worthy enough for a horror film.",1413676800,,2629,4.483193277310924

4327145,3,B004CGUBYI,"Someone previously commented, asking ""can't they make good horror movies anymore?""  Yes, but it's much less expensive to rely on gore via special effects and go right to the heart of visual terror rather than to think about the story line and pay for a good script and a good production crew.  They're paid to produce as quickly as possible - kind of like buying off the rack vs. custom made.  The masses are accustomed to being spoon fed their horror and they often don't distinguish between quality and the lack thereof.  There's a reason all slasher movies look alike - they are.  They're cookie cutter without much in the way of imagination or talent, and this movie just follows suit.  A truly successful horror movie will scare the bejeevers out of you and keep you creeped out throughout the whole movie without even showing any blood. Those are the movies you think about long after you've watched them. They are few and far between but it is possible to make one.  I'm waiting patiently for that to happen again as soon as Hollywood gets its head out of its tush, ponies up and pays for quality writing.",1376870400,,1112,4.585858585858586

4327148,1,B004CGUBYI,"How my ratings work:
5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

You'd think that by now Hollywood would know how computers and the internet works. For those that don't know, the internet doesn't produce static nor does it flash barcodes. I guess Hollywood folk assume that because computers have a screen like TVs have a screen then that must mean they produce static. That would be incorrect because TVs (old ones anyway) have different internal working compared to computers. Not that this can make a movie bad, so let's get to the actual review.

This movie is awful! Someone decides to kill people because they don't spread spam, wow, that's just wow. Also, like most modern horror films, we barely get to know the main characters, and if we do they aren't that interesting or they're sucky characters so we don't care what happens to them. I hate seeing Keith David and Brad Dourif slumming it in movies like this because both are so much better. I gotta say, 5 years really does affect how some people look, because Noah Segan looked more like a high school student in the 2005 film Brick (course he was around 22 then) than he does in this movie. That's another actor who's way better than this crap. I'll give it this, the movie looks good and the gore effects are decent and it's nice to see practical effects, but there are way better movies than this that have good gore (example: John Carpenter's The Thing, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, pretty much any of the original Nightmare on Elm Street films, and so many more). Even the Saw films, for the most part, at least attempt to make you care about the victims. And the motivations of the killer are never made clear, and they hint at some stupid anti tech cult but they never confirm if it's them.

Starting the movie off as a flashback is rarely a good idea, unless it gives you a chance to get to know the main character and actually cares what happens to them. This is not one of those movies. It's amazing how two people don't notice chains hooked up to their cars, or that they're garage door is slightly open. Then there's the fact that the girl chained up decides to lift her head up as she's being dragged, so of course she hits her head on the door. And finally there's the fact that he dad doesn't notice she's chained to the car and continues to drive and it splits her in half and one of her friends is running after the car shouting her name. Hate to break it to you dude, but you don't usually survive getting split in half so yelling her name won't make her less dead. I like to imagine that the dad didn't notice the parts of his daughter dragging behind his car till he got to work (sorry, I have a dark sense of humor like that) and then he puked his brains out.

There really is nothing much you can say about the movie itself because it just drags on and on and nothing really happens. Once again Hollywood, learn how the internet works and stop adding static to the internet. It doesn't make you look stylish, it makes your movie look stupid. I realize this isn't a very well put together review, but the movie wasn't well put together so I think it's a fair trade.",1357862400,2,3289,4.350162866449511

Neil (Cody Kasch) receives a chain letter, and it gets passed on to four friends and relatives. Ignore it and you die. CHAIN LETTER! The box says: ""As time runs out and the deadly letter's rules become more challenging, the survivors must untangle this chilling secret."" I'm not sure what there is to untangle.

People died horrible deaths.  I did not realize this was a slasher film, which is not one of my favorite horror genres.  My daughter became upset on some of the parts.  She watches too much, ""Criminal Minds"".  She felt that the way some of the casts died, could have happened that way in real life.  My sister really was having way too much fun watching this picture.  I on the other hand, was hiding my face and screaming on some of the parts.

The acting from some was okay, except the annoying brother that was jealous of his sister.  Some of the death scenes were over the top and almost funny.  Not to sound heartless, but the brother getting it was sad, but a little cartoonist. A person couldn't really escape their faith after responding to the chain letter.  The killer was scary looking and really enjoyed his work.  He was brutal and the director enjoyed placing the camera right up close to see the tortures.  One scene, I had to turn the TV down and turn my face away.  It was too painful to listen to the young man's suffering.  This is the part that got my daughter upset, which was a point well taken.

4327164,3,B004CGUBYI,"In this age of e-mail, texting, tweeting and twittering, it's inevitable that screenwriters utilize this media as warnings about invasion of privacy and our loss of face to face communication.  CHAIN LETTER is one such movie.
Sadly, the execution is pedestrian, shallow and only mildly interesting.
The 20-something ""teens"" as usual aren't appealing and the motivation for their gruesome deaths is left hanging and merely serves as a prelude to the inevitable sequel.
Horror vets Brad Dourif, Keith David and Betsy Russell get paychecks for their cliche roles but are unremarkable.
I was involved up until its ridiculous ending--the nail in the coffin.
Hope we start getting some decent horror flicks soon!",1297468800,2,706,5.303571428571429
4327165,1,B004CGUBYI,"Practically perfect until the abrupt, let's just finish it in a hurry and get it over with, ending.
Did they run out of money, ideas, or time?
Disappointed, I gave the DVD away after one viewing (as a fan of this genre, I had hoped to keep it for future viewings).
I definitely felt cheated (not only of the cost, but because I had invested a great liking of it...until that crappy non-ending).  Who ruins a movie on purpose?  What were they thinking?  You don't switch gears and introduce elements previously unused then, without any explanation, just roll the credits.  I sat there waiting, thinking more was coming, that couldn't be it, right?  Wrong.
I didn't mind not knowing who the killer was or why he was doing all this, but I did mind the awkward insertion of a conspiracy and the suggestion of a club of loonies that may or maynot have had anything to do with anything that preceeded this revelation.  It's like going on a duck hunt then finding out you're after elephants.  What?
And I really wanted to keep this movie and watch it again and again and again.
Oh well.  Live and learn.  Onto the next.",1296950400,5,1112,4.492537313432836
4327166,3,B004CGUBYI,"Chain Letter is a slasher movie whose plot is very reminiscent to late 90's slashers like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Urban Legend. Only it's not as good as those, because it doesn't seem to realize that it's a teen slasher movie and takes itself way too seriously. There are a few fun death sequences in this thing, but most of them are more torture porn than teen slasher. Also, Chain Letter can be too preachy with its ""technology is evil"" message. And the ending is pretty disappointing. Still, I was never too bored while watching Chain Letter. The acting is very good, I will say. But how could the acting not be good when you have a cast that includes veterans like Keith David (who gets a lot of screen time), Brad Dourif, and Betsy Russell.",1296864000,7,766,4.439716312056738

Oh and mom and dad didn't notice the garage was open??
I would have noticed that. Plus usually u walk out your garage in that type of house...
Please don't make number 2.. I gave it 2 cause the acting wasn't all bad..

8422990,2,B004CGUBYI,"The movie is okay, but gets lost on its propaganda.  The ending is kind of dumb in my opinion.  I'd give it only one star, but the core of the story was solid.  Everything outside the life and death situation is poorly integrated by just shoving it down your throat.  And of course, dumb people making dumb decisions always rules the day.",1517616000,,338,4.403225806451613

8422996,2,B004CGUBYI,"***Spoilers Ahead, Most Definitely*** Usually I avoid horror movies that are all guts & gore like Chain Letter but there was something about this movie that made me just want to see it. The way it starts off,WOW!!! If that doesnt get your attention I don't know what will. After the 1st kill scene, Chain Letter held my attention till the very end. And that was my main problem with this movie, the ending. Even though it was a gorefest, I enjoyed it up until then. When the final credits were rolling up the screen I thought, thats it?! Its over?! I thought I had accidently hit a button & it restarted itself from the beginning. What kind of ending was that??? It left so many questions unanswered. I would say the ending was done like that to leave the door open for a sequel but since Chain Letter came out in 2010 & its 2016 now, I don't see a sequel ever happening. What was a pretty descent movie ended up being totally screwed up by a lousy ending",1472428800,,955,4.311111111111111
