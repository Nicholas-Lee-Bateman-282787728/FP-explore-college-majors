7039596,5,B00UHAJ24S,"The third season of Netflix's first original hit, House of Cards starts to show its flaws, but the show remains as engrossing and rich as ever. When we last saw ruthless politician Frank Underwood, he had successfully pushed President Walker out of office, and Underwood is now running the nation. Should we be concerned or confident?

While the season starts out a bit rote, and it takes some time for Frank and his wife Claire to settle into their new roles, we eventually kick into high gear by episode 6. The way I see the season, it's split into two very different segments. The first focuses on Frank's dealings with Russian prime minister Petrov (sound familiar?) concerning sending support troops to Israel. Petrov is a fascinating character, neither a hero nor villain, played with chilling insanity by Lars Mikkelsen. An early episode finds his visit to the United States getting very awkward as everyone gets intoxicated, leading to some hilarious moments. In the meantime, Claire, newly appointed on the council of the United Nations, faces opposition from both Frank and his opponents as she fights to get support for ground forces in Israel. In the backdrop, Frank is pushing his first big move as president, his program America Works, which aims to get Americans back to work.

That's already a lot, and we're dealing with a lot of information early on. House of Cards has never been for the casual viewer, and this season remains so. Those not sensitized to the wheeling and dealing of Washington should stray far away. The show can get a bit muddled, but showrunner Beau Willimon creatively blends emotion and pathos with these plot devices, making things bearable.

That said, the first couple episodes of the season are a bit rough around the edges. Half of the premiere is spent with Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood's former chief of staff, and his recovery after being assaulted by Rachel, whom he has been trying to keep quiet since season one. A plot that should have ended last season is overstaying its welcome big time here. Doug is an extremely unlikable character, and while House of Cards is full of those, its simply hard to root for him. His scenes pale in comparison to Frank and Claire's, and his character is just boring. They should have wrapped up his story early on and kept it that way, instead of dragging it out every episode until an unsatisfying conclusion. A visit from his brother does little to make things interesting, and you'll be waiting for his scenes to end. Thankfully, it looks like we might be back to the Doug we know and love for the next season.

But Doug isn't the focus here, it's all about Frank and Claire. The sixth episode marks a turning point for the couple, as their trip to Moscow to free a protestor goes south. This causes a rift in their marriage, and from here until the finale, the show delves deep into their marriage as Frank battles for reelection and Claire ponders purpose in her career. Now the cracks in their marriage are starting to show, and it isn't pretty. Claire has always been my favorite character, and she gets some killer scenes in season three. Robin Wright continues to grow and deepen Claire's character, making her the most interesting of the bunch. Claire finally begins to question her work and her ambitions in the second half of season three. Are they a result of her own knack, or because of her husband's position in power? It's an important question that such a political couple like the Underwoods must ponder. By the end, Claire makes up her mind in a polarizing finale, leaving for what should be a riveting season four (should the show get renewed, and why would it not?)

Kevin Spacey brings his A-game as Frank, molding a character so deep and complex that there isn't much to go forward with. A side story involves a journalist coming to the White House to write a story about Frank's new America Works program. But it quickly diverges into a personal piece about Frank and his upbringing. This leads to some excellent scenes where we get to see how Frank really ticks. In short supply this season are Frank's fourth-wall breakings, fan's favorites. It's disappointing, but it's a logical progression as Frank loses grip on those around him. One of the best scenes in the season comes when Frank is debating with his fellow presidential candidates, Heather Dunbar, and Jackie Sharp, House majority whip. It's a wonderful sequence, shot with intensity, as each candidate makes their claim and gang up on each other.

House of Cards is a beast of a show. There's always so much going on that it can be difficult to process, but one of the best produced and shot shows this decade. Cinematography is top notch like always, writing is exhilarating and at times darkly humorous, and the acting is flawless. While the season falters a bit early on, season three is at its best when it delves into the Underwood's marriage. It paints a portrait of a modern political marriage, with great feminist themes in Claire's story and a somber childhood tale of Frank's. This season feels like a gap season - fewer calculated shocks, more slow-burn thematical elements, but at its core it's the same - an irresistible soapy political drama, one that continues to prove why it was made for the binging model.",1426982400,6,5307,4.769314472252448
7039597,3,B00UHAJ24S,"came into House of Cards rather late in the game. It was just a mere two weeks prior to season 2 and I was in bed with my ipad, sick as a dog. There was nothing else on Netflix that piqued my interest, so I decided that I would check out some of their original programming, and House of Cards was my pick mostly because of Kevin Spacey. I ended up really enjoying the first season and finished the whole season in 4 days. Season 2 I finished in a day and a half. It's just how well crafted the show is, how well done and acted and well put together the show manages to be that gives it its kick. So with all the anticipation and hype surrounding season 3, I watched the first 3 episodes before going to a friend's party and watched the rest the next day

One thing I will say about this season was that it's exactly what you want from House of Cards. Excellent acting, rather tension filled plots, gorgeous cinematography and meticulously well-crafted subplots about political happenings. Kevin Spacey's deliciously diabolical performance and Robin Wright's sexy yet dangerous portrayal of his wife has always been something I've really loved about the show. This season has those trademark qualities. However, it does show a rather different side to their relationship, where even Claire begins to question her husband's actions. There's one particularly powerful scene in episode 6 where they have an argument over a gay man's suicide in prison over their homophobic laws which climaxes in them making bold statements about their positions. There's a problem though, this is executed well enough in the first half of the season, and then there's a scene in the second half of the season where she reads Yates' book about her and Frank and becomes upset because they're labeled as a ""power couple"". This didn't seem to make any sense. In seasons 1 and 2 she would do whatever it took to find out what your weakness was and exploit the hell out of it. Here she comes off as an easily upset snitch

There are a good number of flaws with this season and while they aren't enough to make this a bad season, they definitely drag it down. I was really thrilled about the idea of introducting a subplot about the happenings in Russia, but the problem was that it lasted one episode. It felt like the writers thought, ""hey, folks, remember the powerful rape victims subplot from last season? Let's make something like that but with victims of homophobic laws! Except we have to make way for other plots so we can only give it one episode."" Frank and Claire in Russia was indeed awesome, but again, it lasted only one episode, making it feel pointless. In addition, Doug Stamper being alive was something I thought could work, and in fact I did enjoy his first few appearances, but as the season went on, he became creepy and obsessed with Rachel Posner, who herself only gets one episode (spoiler alert: it happens in the finale) and she herself is reduced to a begging mess. Not to mention, I love that this show seems to burst with confidence about its story lines and what not, but this season almost feels like the show has finally believed its own hype. There are a number of scenes where the writers seem to be shouting at you ""LOOK HOW IMPRESSIVE THIS SHOW IS"". The debate scenes in particular definitely seem to reek of this. Frank never really digs up any real dirt on Heather Dunbar and it's rather frustrating to see Frank be reduced to someone who is easily defeated, especially considering in season 1 he got away with killing Russo by posioning him with exhaust, and in season 2 how he threw Zoe into the train tracks and got away with it? Welp, he keeps getting defeated at every turn and it's frustrating to watch at times

However, what keeps this season still worth watching is that in spite of all the flaws, there's still just enough good to keep you engaged. Kevin Spacey's amazing performance works wonders. There's suspense and tension throughout. The ""inner monologues"" scenes are still a thrill to watch, the show is still slickly shot and gorgeous looking. I also really loved the subplot with the writer and how he tries as hard as he could to get as much info about the Underwoods as possible yet at the same time took a treacherous turn in sleeping with Baldwin, the journalist who tries but keeps failing to take the Underwoods down. I also liked Heather Dunbar trying to run against Frank as well. This may be the worst season yet, but even in spite of all the flaws, it still is worth binging, with just enough suspense to keep you satisfied",1426896000,22,4566,4.579462102689487
7039598,3,B00UHAJ24S,"Why has no one made the comparison between the US version and the BBC version?  They have the same story arc.  I had expected season three to be the last since the BBC wisely ended theirs with an unexpected climax.  Spacey has made no mention of the ""other"" series anywhere, which I found odd.  Yes, both are based on Richard III, but really the BBC series is much more memorable since it doesn't depend on too many lurid details, gratuitous sex and violence and vulgarisms, just clever writing.",1426809600,4,495,4.590909090909091
7039599,5,B00UHAJ24S,Love Kevin Spacey and House of Cards. Season 3 was very good and a lot of surprises. Hard to wait for a next season. Claire Underwood sizzles !,1426636800,4,143,4.142857142857143
7039600,3,B00UHAJ24S,"3.5 stars

The first two seasons of House of Cards sizzled. Though not realistic in the sense could this ever happen, it gave me a sense of dirty politics, and how our groups in Washington functions or don't function. Considering the actions of Congress this year, HOC may not be too far off. However, this year, had so many instances of non reality that it became a depressing series.

House of Cards stars Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood, the Democrat U.S. Congressman from South Carolina. He and his wife, Claire, played by Robin Wright, claw their way up the political ladder with every trick you might imagine, murder is not foreign to them. And, at the end of last year, Francis became President after a messy scandal was revealed. They fought and scraped for the Presidency, and it seems, it has usurped everything they thought they might accomplish.

Francis finds he is in a mess, he has not proved to be Presidential, and the Democratic Party wants someone else to run for the ticket. Claire is unhappy, she has no power, it is all in Francis's hands, so she is planning a move. Doug Stanhope survives his wounds from the previous season, and several episodes center on his recovery. It is not until the Russian President Petrov, played brilliantly by Lars Mikkelsen, that some much needed action and sensibility of occurs. The two must pit their wares against each other, and that is entertainment. An author, Tom Yates, played by Paul Sparks, is hired to write a memoir of Francis and his new project. He becomes involved with a high powered newspaper journalist, played by Kim Dickens who wants the inside scoop on Francis.

But, it comes too late to save this season, it is depressing, and I did not feel any need to rush through the episodes. In the past I would impatiently wait for Netflix to release the series, and then binge watch. Not this year, I took them slowly, and even though at times, the pace picked up, it left me feeling a little down. Most of the season was well written, but not interesting enough. I don't hear the patter about the show, it died down very quickly. If there is a season four, where will it go?

Recommended. prisrob 03-16-15",1426464000,63,2176,4.641558441558441
7039611,4,B00UHAJ24S,"Season 3 was good but not as good as the first two seasons. Also, some of the story lines just seemed to run on. In retrospect, I think they should've cut the number of episodes from 13 to 10/11 starting in S3. I watched the original House of Cards (UK version) and its short length - only 4 episodes per season - made it much more enjoyable. Sometimes less is really more.",1517270400,,373,4.194444444444445

I have a healthy amount of scepticism as to the morals and ethics of our Government, but the way House of Cards lays it out, it seems to try to anihilate all belief in Government, which would result in anarchy. Not a concept I cherish as it would not improve my or anyone elses survival.

7039755,5,B00UHAJ24S,"""House of Cards,"" Season 4, Episode 10.

Wow.

I've never hated a series' characters or their actions more, while being simultaneously completely enthralled by them. It takes strong writing to addict viewers to that which they hate. It is the study of humanity at its darkest, while conveying itself as a beacon of hope and light. Deception of others among deception of self. Greed unbridled, and occasionally recognized yet continued onward by those in its grasp. The fruits of greed's labor came to fruition in so many ways in this episode, and even glimpses of apparent atonement twisted into only further tentacles of derangement.

One would have to watch all the prior episodes of this season, and the seasons prior, to receive the full impact of this episode; but this episode in particular could be used as a Master's Class in writing, directing, and acting.

There was one line of dialogue in this episode that I absolutely adored; as it was poetic and poignant toward life in general, while also serving to summarize one of the characters completely. It was a line spoken by that character's mother, as the mother spoke nearly her dying words. I won't spoil it by writing it here, for those who, like myself, were late to the game in watching this series and understanding why it is so highly acclaimed.

But this series, and especially this episode -- wow.",1471564800,,1366,4.82051282051282

7039789,5,B00UHAJ24S,"This the third season of this engrossing political drama....
The manipulative 'Francis Underwood' (Kevin Spacey) has engineered himself and his equally ambitious wife
'Clare' (Robin Wright) into the 'White House'
Of course the position hadn't been acquired at the polls, 'Francis' had stood on many toes to get there, he had
ruthlessly wheeled and dealt leaving many floundering in the storm, many those loyal to the 'Underwood's' had
been discarded.
In office he finds he has little in the way of support within his party, he will try and bypass them to get his own
way, he'll even pretend that he'll not seek election in 18 months time, he's fooling no-one in truth.
Quietly he's hoping his 'America Works' program will turn the tide in his favour prior to party-selection ahead of
the 2016 election, despite the fact he's jeopardised funds for both emergency-relief and indeed welfare.
'Clare's ambitions stretch beyond the work , she had done for many years, she seeks an ambassador role and will
exert pressure upon 'Francis' to ensure she gets it.
The knives are being sharpened to bring him down he's made many enemies along the way, it is unlikely they will
not seek to even the score.
'Doug Stamper' (Michael Kelly) who had helped 'Francis' get to where he has, now recovering his injuries seeks to
renew his association with his long time boss, discarding 'Doug's approaches could prove costly, he surely knows
far too much about the Underwoods.
However, if he is ever to return to the fold he'll need to kick his drink-habit and also put closure on that which has
taken over his thinking.
'Francis's' dealings with international leaders such as Russia's President 'Viktor Petrov' (Lars Mikkelsen) become
somewhat shambolic, 'Clare' certainly scuppers any chance of agreement by speaking her mind when silence would
have been more appropriate, which will add to the strain upon their marriage, the price of putting the talks back on
the table will come at a price.
Kevin Spacey is wickedly convincing as the ruthless and largely self-serving U.S President.
Sadly there are so many superb must-see series being shown on the T.V Channels it is almost impossible to keep up,
i myself didn't see the British-Version of this and am told i missed a brilliant series, glad to pick up on this....for me
this remains a must-see drama.",1468108800,2,2335,4.9440203562340965
7039790,1,B00UHAJ24S,"Loved the first season, had a mixed reaction to season two, but thought that this season was just awful. My main problem with the show is that it doesn't see that it is some lowbrow soap opera, but because of it's two talented leads and high production value it takes it self so seriously and thinks its gonna go down as one of the greats, when it is far from the greatness of The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The West Wing, etc. The character of Frank Underwood is just becoming repetitive, we get it, you are evil. And the writing is just lazy since it seems like Frank and Claire have no reasonable enemies, and everything happens wayyyyy to easy for them. My final problem of the season is that they are trying to take Frank Underwood, a character who was introduced as an evil self serving sociopath and now they wanna make you feel bad for him and the pressures of being in office when the character is clearly servicing himself.",1468022400,,949,4.428571428571429

I think our Government is so corrupt thus the huge mess we currently find ourselves in. The concept of this whole series seems to be cheating and lying and do whatever is necessary whether it is right or wrong to reach someone's goal. It definitely has some wonderful actors/actresses in it, but the Citizens of the USA already have lost their trust in our leaders and this show just makes it worse.  The Whitehouse should be a house of Respect and Honor where the 10 Commandments can be posted and that people aren't arrested or thrown in jail for praying to their Lord and God.  I know the Bush Father and Son have been blamed for lots of things, but I do know they always prayed every morning for help in making the right decisions for the people of this country. You never even hear that mentioned in not only this show, but others. Producers/Directors are afraid of losing viewers.  What a shame.",1463270400,,1014,4.377659574468085

7039913,5,B00UHAJ24S,"I waited until shortly before season 4 began to watch season 3. I wanted to get his presidency under my belt in one fell swoop. It is a very good production with very high performances, as usual, by the two leads as well as their supporting cast. There is one thing that has been given to Kevin Spacey's character which I could have used a bit of in Robin Wright's character. He is given a bit of a sense of humor. Wright is always the Ice Queen, in perfect control, and never has an instant of silliness.

I think the portrayal is spot on as to how people who want to be in the White House generally behave. I do not see them as adherents of their parties. Once they assume office, they see their parties as nuisances. The President wants to be Commander in Chief without Congress and the Supreme Court getting in the way. Of course, the President can't because the Constitution stands in the way. That dynamic, the constant war over being leader, but being checked, is the crux of the story. So even though Frank Underwood is the slickest, not to mention very murderous politician, even he constantly finds himself with his back against the wall. Although Frank Underwood the Congresswoman could throw a young woman off a subway platform to her death, Frank Underwood the President could never do the same. He is way too hemmed in to pull off anything so individual.

Season Three has a just as fascinating a side story going on though. Doug, the chief of staff, was seriously injured and has a long and painful rehab ahead of him. He also has the problem of finding Rachel, who could bring the whole House of Cards tumbling down around the President. And when he finds her, will he be able to kill her? That, of course, is the only way to clamp down the lid.

Season 3 spends a lot of time examining the Underwood presidency and Doug's problems in making sure that presidency does not blow up on him. Claire Underwood shows herself to be way more ambitious than I ever surmised before. This will only intensify. The main person who must handle Claire with her resolute ambition is Frank and even he is having a hard time containing her. That you see them both on the box together is no coincidence. They are equal stars in seasons three and four.

All in all a pretty fascinating show. Another reviewer remarked that the show is ""leftist propaganda.""  I do not believe the Underwoods have any underlying ideology other than the quest for power. I think every domestic and foreign program, every move, is calculated based on staying in office and succeeding at being Commander in Chief. There is NO other ideology nor is there room for any.  This is a very accurate assessment of the Presidency present day. If being a Democrat would get Frank into office, he'd be a Democrat. If being a Republican would get him into office, he'd be a Republican. He doesn't care. The whole point is getting into office and staying there. If he were leader of another country, he'd be a dictator and would be well suited for that role. He might miss all the maneuvering against everyone trying to outsmart him though.",1457568000,,3103,4.542039355992844

7040041,4,B00UHAJ24S,"While I thought the first two seasons were A1, I am going to give a lesser rating to season 3, primarily because of two reasons, one the jobs program espoused by the President is a lame issue, unlike the education bill in earlier seasons where everyone has an axe to grind with unions usurping their mandates, the jobs program presents a welfare slant, which the American public is not yet familiar with. The other reason is the unfocused desire by the first Lady to be the UN ambassador and the President first not wanting to run for election, then changing his mind, Gerry Ford never had misgivings about running for the Presidency.

Still the acting is great, wish the former Chief of Staff had stayed out of Season 3, and also wish Edward Meechum the body guard had more of a role as he used to, when he was conniving with Kevin Spacey.

Can't wait for Season 4",1452556800,,865,4.468354430379747

7040044,5,B00UHAJ24S,"Having finally attained the presidency, Frank and Claire Underwood (Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright) find that keeping the power they have long sought may be more difficult than getting it.

While some of the political developments in this series may set the eyes rolling, it is the relationships between characters that make it such a successful show for me.  Finally, we see how bleak and empty scrabbling for power can be.  The bond between Frank and Claire was always the one positive thing in their lives that allowed me to sympathize with them even when they were doing awful things, but now they have begun to chew away at that.  Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) had a chance for rehabilitation, but ultimately turned his back on his own humanity in order to get back into Franks good graces.  Given the tantalizing season-ending cliffhanger, it looks like next season may be when the house of cards finally comes toppling down.

7040081,2,B00UHAJ24S,"For the first couple of seasons, this american remake was significantly better than the BBC original (in itself, to the best of my knowledge, a television first).

Unfortunately, in season 3 Spacey & Co. seem to have decided to abandon the beautifully simple dramatic arc of the original, perhaps with the intention of running the series for as long as it was successful, or into the ground, whichever came first. The ground came up fast, and season 3 promptly crashed.

Most of it is dreadfully slow going. It tightens up again in the last 3 hours, but by then most viewers would already be asleep. A number of devices are deployed to try to sustain interest: changing Robin Wright's hair color, more of Spacey vamping, the old anthrax mail gambit, & the proverbial season end cliffhanger (seasons one and two, like the original, were good enough to do without), etc. etc.. None of it works very well.

Sadly, the production company striking out on its own with this has had the paradoxical result of turning a once spectacularly good offering into just another tired remake.",1448150400,2,1076,4.805405405405406

Despite missing 7 episodes I was easily able to follow the story line, while missing all the filler episodes that plague these TV dramas that are dragged out to never ending stories. Season 3 fails because HoC lost its principle dramatic tension - the journalists on Frank Underwoods case. They are written out in Season 3, and so there is no prospect of a challenge to his power, apart from Rachel (written out), Doug Stamper, (unlikely but a possibility) or his wife, who may run for president or spill the beans. I will return to the first 3 episodes of Season 4 in 2016, to see if anything of interest emerges to threaten Underwoods power and bring him to justice.",1447804800,,832,4.437908496732026

7040089,4,B00UHAJ24S,"While I thought the first two seasons were A1, I am going to give a lesser rating to season 3, primarily because of two reasons, one the jobs program espoused by the President is a lame issue, unlike the education bill in earlier seasons where everyone has an axe to grind with unions usurping their mandates, the jobs program presents a welfare slant, which the American public is not yet familiar with.  The other reason is the unfocused desire by the first Lady to be the UN ambassador and the President first not wanting to run for election, then changing his mind, Gerry Ford never had misgivings about running for the Presidency.

Still the acting is great, wish the former Chief of Staff had stayed out of Season 3, and also wish Edward Meechum the body guard had more of a role as he used to, when he was conniving with Kevin Spacey.

Who ever wrote the third season should go back selling fries or similar as they have no clue about the characters they were writing about.
We bought the DVD-box the minute it was released and can't watch more than 2 DVDs as the story is completely nuts, you do not expect to see the marriage problems you would find in cheap afternoon shows with gender problems and no red line to follow. The second season had already no constant direction, it was obviously that there were too many writers, but the third one confirms the proverb too many cooks spoil the broth and destroy the story. The heads of Netflix should focus on bandwidth and not on content.

The series keeps moving; it's not a rehash of the same situations played and replayed but instead we now see Francis and Claire Underwood placed in new situations as a result of their conniving in the first two seasons. All of it is tied together by sleazy politics, of course, but each episode is fresh and holds my interest from the opening scene.

That Frank could literally get away with murder and yet become president seems on one hand to be hard to believe yet just take a look at what he have in office with our present administration and while there is perhaps no one who has literally murdered anyone, it still is pretty unbelievable what us poor citizens have to put up with as far as who governs us. While House of Cards has some pretty wild situations, it is probably no worse than reality. Its just that in watching the series we can laugh with incredulity at the behavior instead of crying at the reality in our own country.

As we watched season 3, we felt that we had tuned into reruns of that old series. Until I received season 3 (We had watched season 1 and 2 from borrowed DVDs from my brother-in-law.) We watched the BBC series of the same name, that this series was based on. I had purchased it years ago, but didn't watch it, as my wife thought it was boring. It was worth watching, to see how closely this series was based on it. Once we got into it, it was just as riveting as this American series is. Then we watched season 3 of this series, still interesting, but not as intense as season 1 or 2.

No specifics because I don't want to spoil the series for anyone but the rest of this season is great...some episodes stronger than others but all leading to what I understand is a fourth season. I love it when Frances speaks directly to the viewer, breaking the fourth wall. You feel as though you know so much more than the other characters in the show. If it were not for that last episode I would have given this series a full five stars.

House of cards is absolute tops in drama, and excitement and political intrigue. Think it is all imagination and nothing like that will have happen in reality. Take a look at the political drama in Malaysia right now and think again. A movie about that political saga will be made some day. House of cards, a must see.

As the Underhill's finally get everything they have schemed for, we finally get to see the repercussions of their past indiscretions coming to haunt them.  I think the problem that I had with this season was that the repercussions don't seem quite severe enough.  Frank and Claire are completely without any moral or ethical value.  At some point doesn't the ground have to fall out from underneath them?  Apparently, not.  Season three isn't as over the top as seasons one and two so I actually found it a lot more believable.",1439769600,4,600,4.613207547169812

This  series is such an amazing look at the workings of politicians, their benefactors, the lust for power, and the strategies they employ to get what they want.  There are surprises at every turn, great peripheral characters, and disbelief at some of the tactics employed.  This is a far more cynical view of Washington then we ever had in ""The West Wing"" .

7040438,4,B00UHAJ24S,"++Warning++ there will be spoilers from prior seasons in this review, but no major giveaways from season 3.  If you have not seen the first two seasons, proceed with caution.

Season 3 follows up a few months down the line from Frank maneuvering his way into the Presidency.  Unfortunately, for most of the season, the story of him trying to keep power is not as thrilling or enticing as his grab for power.  At this point the story has abandoned any threat to Frank for the murders of Russo and Zoe.  The only loose end from seasons 1 and 2 is Doug's obsession with finding Rachel after she hit him with a rock and ran off at the end of the second season.  Much of his story involves recovering from his brain injury, dealing with his alcoholism, and finding her.  Frank's story this season is divided between dealing with the Russians (and a very Putin like president), trying to get his jobs program off the ground, in a very dubious fashion, and then campaigning to be re-elected going against a female Solicitor General.  While he is still very slimy and underhanded this season, he does not get his hands as dirty (for obvious reasons) as he did in the first two seasons.

The show takes a big turn toward the end when Frank and Claire's relationship starts to disintegrate.  Her arc during the season goes from being first lady to forcing herself into a UN Ambassadorship and then back to the dutiful first lady campaigning for her husband.  All throughout the cracks in her armor, which in many ways is thicker than even Frank's get wider, in large part due to a writer who Frank hires to write a book about his America Works program, but comes up with something much different.  The big season cliffhanger and lead in to season 4 really is about their relationship.

For those who get the blu-ray, the show looks and sounds great as you would expect.  There are only a couple extras, a 25 min behind the scenes/making of feature on the third season, and an 18 min feature involving the end of a character arc.  I cannot say too much more without giving major plot lines away, but the extras are good for what are there for those who enjoy the bonus material.  My only real complaint is the packaging.  The discs are again packed in very tight slip cases.  Not a huge issue for the blu-rays because of the anti scratch coating, but beware if you get the DVDs they could easily scratch taking them out.",1438387200,2,2409,4.498850574712644
7040439,5,B00UHAJ24S,"Okay, I assumed after Season 2 that the only horror left was for Mr. F. U. to push the Red Button and destroy Earth with nukes.  But there are many surprising horrors in Season 3, enough to keep one from falling asleep.  Thank God the Extras, Behind the Scenes, are excellent.  I love to see how much Fun the actors had between takes, how incredibly smart they are, and how the cameras look up close.  I guess I should have gone to Hollywood (instead of helping astronauts go to the Moon).",1438300800,,489,4.34065934065934

Loved that they had the real Russian dissidents appear in the episode with the Putin-like Russian President. I think the program is very realistic.

Enjoy in your mind the BEAUTY that is seasons 1-2... remember the drama, the suspense, the relationships, and the personal struggle of these mighty figures as they maneuvered the system so masterfully.

Why Seasons 3 sucks:
>> They have no where to go... they are at the top and the wonderful conniving that made the show so good is gone.  And they clearly have no idea what they are doing or where they are going
>> The drama is...wait for it... are you ready... an Israeli/Palestinian peace deal!!  OMG!  It's better than PBS Newshour!
>> Doug... remember Doug?  Well, they just screw around with him the whole season.
>> They continue to destroy what makes it great, ending with a bizarro violent out burst between the first couple which is completely forced and destroys a founding principle of the show... the union between the two of them
>> Speaking of destroying what makes it great, remember the whole talking to the camera thing... they can't figure out how to use it or when to do it anymore.  It's lost all impact and doesn't advance the narrative at all.

We are left with a bad soap opera that only gets good reviews because we LOVED the early seasons.  Batman was right... die the hero or live long enough to become the villain.",1437436800,9,1264,4.582222222222223

This seems like that kind of season to me. The majority of the episodes would have been filler in the first two seasons. The story just is not captivating, and the plot goes nowhere. It is basically reduced to your standard fare political show.

Worst of all is we see Underwood go from mastermind to failure. He spends most of the season reacting to dissent all around him. He doesn't seem to have any control over the people around him or his destiny. This is a stark contrast to the man we saw in seasons 1 & 2.

Most of all I was just bored. I watched several episodes in a row and realized after a while that I wasn't even paying attention because I just stopped caring about 2-3 episodes in.

The last few episodes set up what could be a return to form for season 4, but I won't waste my time again if it starts to limp along like this season does. Kevin Spacey is too talented to be wasted like this.",1436832000,6,1032,4.196969696969697

The characters feel tired and the idea behind the ""America Works"" program is completely ridiculous. Would the President really steal all of that money from FEMA to push through his pet project? I was waiting for a big natural disaster to hit and what Frank would have to do then. That would have made for a much much much improved story line over what was presented. The biographer character was stupid and added nothing to the plot. Claire's character has become weak and meek and even her storming out of the White House during the finale held little emotion for me. The whole debate debacle was stupid and unnecessary. Frank screws over every person he pretends to care about for financial/political gain. Every character he promotes then stabs him in the back because Frank is a gigantic tool in this season. There is not one true ounce of honesty left in the husk of a character that once was the Frank Underwood I thought was fascinating. I doubt I will watch the next season at all.

7040522,4,B00UHAJ24S,"This series is fun to watch, the production values are extremely high, and the acting is superb. But I can't give it five stars because something important is missing--a fundamental sense of truthfulness and conviction.

For example, for a number of reasons, it isn't credible that Frank Underwood is a 21st century Democrat. In Season Three, he wants to destroy the Social Security program to create jobs and put all those welfare recipients to work. That's simply not believable. That's the Republican, not the Democratic, mindset. The Underwoods have no children, apparently because the producers wanted to present Claire as coldly ambitious, and they also wanted to use a past abortion as a plot element subjecting her to blackmail and risk. But none of this rings true. A couple so politically driven would have had children to use as campaign props, wouldn't they?

I find dramas about politics and government such as ""The West Wing"" and the Danish series ""Borgen"" fascinating. ""House of Cards"" doesn't measure up to those other two because truth is often sacrificed for manipulative purposes, to create drama or suspense or even humor. I thought the DVDs of all three seasons were worth the price and the investment of time required to watch them, but the series could have been so much better. Maybe the problem is that the people producing and writing it don't believe in or care about anything except creating great entertainment.",1436745600,3,1440,5.02092050209205

7040537,2,B00UHAJ24S,"I absolutely loved the first two seasons, but by the time we get to the end of series 3, Claire Underwood has devolved into such a self-absorbed, narcissistic, selfish, sabotaging, undermining such and such, that I don't think I can watch anymore.  Insulting the Russian president at his own press conference was an act that any politician on earth would have the better sense not to commit. Bailing on Frank in Iowa, when he needed her the most, was so unbecoming of the power couple I once regarded the Underwoods as being.  They were a couple that could get through anything, even occasional affairs, because they were always completely honest with each other, and told each other everything.  You knew that no matter what they did, they had this underlying love for each other, which humanized them in spite of some really bad behavior. This show was much better when Frank and Claire had each other's backs and weren't making so many rookie mistakes. You can tell that episodes were written by different people as some of them were actually good, while others, including the unforgivable finale, were awful to the point where you can't even begin to empathize with the decision making processes of the characters.",1434499200,11,1218,4.874396135265701

The acting is up to its usual class and whilst the twists are not as good as in previous seasons the journey through the thirteen episodes is a very good one.

7040542,5,B00UHAJ24S,"Let's just start by admitting that Season 3 is different than Seasons 1-2.

Season 1-2 focused on the political manipulations of the Underwood's rise to power, but season 3 starts to look less at the manipulation and more at the characters and consequences they begin to reap. The story development is a little less linear, sort of letting the plot of the show just meander through the season so the character development can really shine.

Season 3 is sort of like the beginning of a darker, grittier ""The West Wing"". Where the latter was focused on people doing right for the good of others and being generally good people, House of Cards turns around and looks at politicians serving themselves, manipulating their constituents and colleagues, and generally finding themselves in questionable moral circumstances.",1431734400,4,816,5.12781954887218

7040544,4,B00UHAJ24S,"What compels us as an audience is a central conflict or the classic hero's journey. In Frank Underwood's case, it's the anti-hero's journey, or perhaps villain's journey. Even though Frank is villainous, we like him as everyone else around him seems pretty integrity-challenged as Frank, but they aren't as smart. In the first two seasons the central conflict is how does Frank amass more power? Can he survive and thrive in Washington? By the end of Season 2, Frank gets the top job: the Prez.

Now Frank has got the power he lusted for. Where does he go next? We wonder how are the writers going to keep the dramatic tension amped. I thought they're smart, and Kevin Spacey as Frank is cagey, they'll whip something up. But couldn't figure out how they were going to do it as it goes against the laws of classic storytelling. Frank is top dog - there's nowhere to go but down, or into the doghouse which pretty much happens.

Suddenly, Frank is vulnerable. And that's not the Frank we knew and loved. Frankly, Frank and Claire having marital woes doesn't do it for us. We don't like a weakened Frank. Oh, maybe for a second or two, he can shade a tear, but we like the scheming and conniving Frank with tricks up his sleeve going up against someone with more power or $$ and outwitting them.

Hope in Season 4 Frank is back with a spring in his step and some darkness in his heart. It will be interesting to see how the writers bring back the magic.",1428883200,3,1451,4.447368421052632
7040545,3,B00UHAJ24S,"Season 3 was a bit of a disappointment even though I still watched every minute of it. There were some interesting plot developments, but the season degraded into a soap opera. The problem is that all the main characters are unlikeable. There's nobody to root for. Claire is a ruthless, narcisstic charlatan. Who cares if she's not happy and bored? Her vigil with the activist in the Russian prison, and her dramatic insult of the Russian president were self serving and manipulative. Her insistence on being ambassador was ill conceived and self aggrandizing. (Spoiler Alert) She leaves Frank at the most critical moment. It was all about her.
  Then Frank starts off the season urinating on his father's grave. I assume that is to shock the audience and perhaps solidify his credentials as a jerk. Let's not forget he committed murder twice with his own hands just to get ahead, not to mention ordering a third murder. So if Claire leaves him, why should we worry about him?
  Then Doug Stamper (more spoiler alert) commits premeditated murder for his boss. He's a robot with no conscience. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him because he has to use a cane to walk? So he has a brother with kids. So what?
  Jackie the whip gets married, maybe like a normal person, but no, she has to run back to her former boyfriend before her honeymoon with her apparently decent husband is barely over. I guess he wasn't exciting enough. Jackie is a war hero, thank you for your service, Jackie, but you're not a hero anymore.
  She's not too bright either, throwing a challenge at her debate opponent not having any preparation for the response.
  All the main characters are thugs, manipulators, murderers. None of them are evolving, seeking forgiveness, or even getting their comeuppance. They are just becoming more of their nasty selves, so it's hard to become involved with or care about them, and thus more difficult to engage with the story.
  Season 4 might be interesting if that computer hacker guy (whom a crippled Doug Stamper could inexplicably beat up) comes up with some data connecting Frank with Zoe, and the noose starts to tighten, then we might be on to something. Otherwise worrying about Frank and Claire's relationship is a boring waste of time.",1428796800,7,2259,4.778920308483291
7040546,5,B00UHAJ24S,"I've found this season to be as intense as previous seasons.  Robin Wright is incredible, as is the diabolical Kevin Spacey.  The series is film craft and acting at its finest, dark but utterly engaging.  A study of power, perversion, ruthlessness and dependence.  And politics. The relationship between the president and his wife, and how much hinges on that, becomes a focus.  The introduction of the author writing the president's biography adds dimension.  It took me a while to realize that is the same guy who played one of Nucky's workers in ""Boardwalk Empire"" (the foolish guy).  His character is quite a bit different here. He does an excellent job, as does the whole cast.  A dark season, but riveting nonetheless.  The scene where Robin Wright is giving blood and talking to her husband's biographer before she passes out - wow.  She is like that - beautiful, hypnotic, glamourous, chilling - - yet warmly mesmerizing again.  They couldn't have chosen a better woman for this part.  Although you'll be wondering what she's up to by the end of this season.  And no doubt will be feeling President Spacey's frustration.",1428364800,3,1128,4.904761904761905

7040548,5,B00UHAJ24S,"Don't let the negative reviews fool you. If you've been watching for political hijinks and sinister machinations, season 3 may leave you disappointed. It's less Machiavellian than the previous seasons and is not as tightly plotted.

However, the character work is divine. Claire's seeds of regret we have seen scattered throughout the previous seasons here begin to bloom, while Frank amidst new glory puzzles over how to please his wife. The success of this political duo has humanized them greatly, and it is at the peak of their power that they can see the most clearly, and from here their weaknesses begin to undo them. For what purpose have they done this--for their own glory, or for Frank's? What motivations lie behind Frank's wild hunger? Does Claire want Frank or need him, and if she only needs him, then what does she actually want out of life and is it possible he only stands in the way?

The character continue to be stony and opaque--don't expect solid answers to these questions. But questions such as these are much closer to the forefront of the plot now, now that we have the tiresome ""Will Frank make it?"" questions done with. We still have political maneuvering, but all of the stakes have become much more personal. The intrigue is simpler but more relatable in my opinion.

If you thought the first two seasons were perfect, you may not like this season. If the first two seasons left you feeling as though this show was building towards something it hadn't quite reached, then behold--these characters are truly starting to shine. This has been a divisive season for sure and I only hope the negative attention doesn't sway the intentions of the writers, who are really starting to show their worth in my eyes. If you prefer thought and human hesitation over the sheer thrill of winning--character work over plot twists--I think this season will be sure to impress you. Otherwise, don't go into season three expecting the show to continue playing the same simple thrill you're used to.",1427155200,54,2011,4.823188405797102
7040549,4,B00UHAJ24S,"Season 3 was enjoyable. But it wasn't on par with seasons 1 and 2.

The first 2 seasons featured Frank Underwood being a scheming, low life despicable politician who was constantly plotting his next move with surgical precision. He was the slime ball politician that we assume they all are in real life, yet somehow he made you root for him.

Season 3 was different. Frank is now the President (all through scheming, without getting a single vote from the public) and he's dealing with much larger problems. And he almost seems overwhelmed by the office. He's no longer the large and in charge Frank Underwood of old. He's on his heels for most of the season defending attackers and watching his usually perfectly planned schemes fail.

Additionally Frank almost starts to develop a conscious. He feels bad for soldiers that are killed as a result of his orders as commander in chief. His America Works program (A jobs program to bring the unemployment rate to 0%. It's the main legislative story of the entire season.) actually seems like important legislation to him rather than just another means to secure his power. Frank's entire image is tweaked a little bit as the result of becoming the president.

Clair Underwood undergoes much of the same kinds of transformations as a character. She was always just as scheming and underhanded as Frank, always with their shared eye hyper focused on their goals. But in season 3 she starts to crack a little as well. Her path starts to diverge from Frank's and she shows some real emotion for the first time in the series.

But that doesn't ruin the show by any means. It shows just how difficult the presidency must be. The change in Frank's and Clair's dynamics actually keeps the show fresh in season 3.

The problem with season 3 is that it the whole season feels like exposition for season 4. Not much progresses in season 3 as far as the story. All the problems they present in the first couple episodes are still problems in the last episode. There is not much progression to the overall story at all. Season 3 really focuses on the change in the characters, not the plot of the show. It all just feels like they are setting up major plot movement for season 4.

Generally speaking that's okay. It doesn't ruin the show nor kill my interest in season 4. Season 3 was still very watchable and well worth your time. And with a 13 episode run it's not a huge time commitment. But the lack of story movement did make season 3 drag on a bit slower than seasons 1 and 2.

The other thing that feels different about season 3 is the change in the way the characters are presented. Frank still talks to the audience by looking directly into the camera, but not nearly as much. That is a huge dynamic of the show up to this point and it's minimalized in season 3. Changes like that affect the whole feel of the show and this particular one left season 3 feels a tad disjointed from the rest of the series.

Without going into details I will say this...despite the relative slowness of season 3, the final episode sets up A LOT that will be going on in season 4 and instantly converts your attitude from ""Well season 3 was alright...."" to ""Oh my god! When does season 4 get released! I want to watch it now!!!!"" (Then you realize it's probably 12-18 months away and you're mad at the show for hooking you like that at the end)

But I'll also add that if season 4 has the same speed and general feel that season 3 did, it'll lose me before season 5.",1427068800,93,3490,4.481889763779527
7040550,4,B00UHAJ24S,"Season 3... well, I was a little disappointed, I realize a president cannot get away with the shenanigans  of the what went on as a senator but Claire is in a massive depression, crazy outbursts and she doesn't make sense anymore. Clearly they were both edgy and brilliant before, now she seems ""broken"" and looks to the president to fulfill her. Underwood is still dedicated to his wife as before but her depressive behavior ruined some of this season for me. They are a great team together but when Claire's role changed to this... they lost me a little.
Remmie (sp?) is also suddenly on the ticket and involved but why? This is the guy Underwood doesn't trust and suddenly he has a front row seat? Not sure about the plot twist, didn't work for me.
Still a great deal better than most series but it has lost an edge that made me jump out of my seat to watching Spacey break a crucifix and act out in a way that neither added to the plot or had any effect, although John Domain was appreciated.",1426982400,,996,4.383783783783784
