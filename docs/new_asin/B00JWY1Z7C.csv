8654316,5,B00JWY1Z7C,Very much an eye opener. Every one needs to exam the info Billy Crone puts out,1466899200,2,78,3.9375
8654317,5,B00JWY1Z7C,"I think the film is very well put together. Christians and non-Christians need to see it, simply to be informed of what is going on.
I watched the DVDs over a few days, and I found that the exposure to reports of demonic activity left an after-taste of evil, which took a few days to wear off. Nevertheless, I'm glad I watched the DVDs. I'm better informed than I was.",1462924800,2,368,4.271428571428571
8654318,5,B00JWY1Z7C,"I learned a lot about the history of UFO.'s. Example: I didn't know that Alexander the great fought a UFO. A lot of preachers think the great deception in the last days are UFO.""s or evolution. If you stop and think about it they dove-tail into each other. He did a good job in both avenues of the ""History of UFO.'s"" and ""the deception of demons"" parts.",1456358400,2,354,4.298507462686567
8654319,2,B00JWY1Z7C,"I will admit I haven't watched all the videos.  I may not.  The incessant background music drives me straight up a wall!  The only reason the music is there, in my opinion, is a subtle way to create a mood to make the viewer more receptive to the subject matter. When the pastor started to tell us how the aliens think and what they say--I was ""blown away"".  When did he talk to them?  If he did, why hasn't the public been told about it?  More questions could be asked--I stopped watching them.

I am a Christian who believes that Enoch had encounters with ""alien beings""; after all angels are not of this dimension.  I was looking for an intellectual discussion, from a Christian perspective, about  how the UFOs and alien encounters could be the fallen angels we read about in Genesis.  I didn't find that in these videos.",1421280000,6,825,4.476510067114094
