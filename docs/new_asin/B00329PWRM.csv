8387357,4,B00329PWRM,"In many ways, this movie is a standard action adventure movie from Hollywood's golden age.  Robert Taylor is dynamic and resourceful; Eleanor Parker is brave, beautiful and occasionally needs rescuing. The plot is the usual lost tomb with a great discovery to be made, this one concerning Joseph and proof of his biblical existence hidden in a pyramid burial chamber.  Along the way our heros face treachery, scorpions, sand storms, belly dancers, etc. as in most movies of this type.  What sets it apart is that it was actually filmed in Egypt in the 50's (in color) so the movie has shot after shot of pyramids, sculpture and other gorgeous scenery in a way I suspect would be impossible to see today.  It is truly beautiful to look at!",1262476800,4,738,4.6976744186046515
