2476488,3,B000E0OE1M,"First of all, the films look good - nice, clean prints with good sound. It's so great to finally see them on DVD. I've waited long for these to finally be released.

I do have a few qualms, however:

No. 1: The anti-copying warnings on DVDs just get more and more obnoxious and in your face, and this set is as bad as any. I'm tired of being treated like a criminal and squirming uncomfortably while waiting for the warning to pass. No, you can't FF or skip ahead. Why can't they stick these warnings discreetly at the end, as found on most earlier editions of DVDs? The propaganda war being waged by copyright holders is making victims of legitimate customers by holding them hostage and forcing them to view shrill language of warnings.

No. 2: The main menus play a loud loop of music - poor choice. It soon becomes very annoying.

No. 4: The new featurettes were disappointing.

No. 4: Amazon now will only fill ""Super Saver"" orders after five to seven days wait, in spite of an item being in stock and available with the information ""usually ships in 24 hours"". To get this set, I chose not to wait and to instead use 2nd day for $11.93. In the case of this set, that exhorbitant price of shipping was worth it to me to not have to wait another week, but Amazon is making the online shopping experience increasingly less attractive by purposefully slowing order fulfillment. I might as well just buy these in a store and save money (sales tax for this set is a lot less than overnight shipping).",1143072000,38,1500,4.44
2476489,4,B000E0OE1M,"allright....

this is a quality collection of films and I'm very glad to have them....they look pretty good considering their age....and Dick Powell is charming ...and its a hoot to see Joan BLondell.  Billy Barty's appearance is also classic and some of the songs are truly....standards!  Berkeley's choreography is unforgettable.

lets get to the DVD set itself..

EXTRAS...

the featurettes (newly created) for each film are pretty dull talking heads nonsense...and feature the same folks from the Astaire Rogers collection .....viewed once...you likely will not view again....and WB has a new featurette for 42nd Street ...but unwilling to re-author that film as its already on DVD..the featurette on 42nd street is on the GOLDIGGERS of 1933 DVD!!  wow...cheap cheap..

my main deduction of the 1 star is for the poor quality of the recent featurettes...and WB's putting the 42nd street featurette on a completely different movie!!!

the VINTAGE cartoons and featurettes are fun and good to have..

the BONUS DVD which is basically  all performance/song greatest hits is a nice touch....showcasing not only the DVDs included but several not  included and is a wonderful 2 and a half hour presentation...

the bonus 8track CD is a teaser for more...

this is classic musical movie making and shouldn't be missed by fans of the genre  or film enthusiasts...

I only hope that WB gets a bit better with the bonus features and stops the obvious ""cost cutting"" approach...OH..and as WB has been doing  lately..the DVDs no longer have  colour artwork on their faces with images from  the front...but are plain with black  type...WB has begun this recently as another way to save .05 per DVD....Its obvious they are cutting  corners.",1142985600,16,1730,5.129032258064516
2476490,5,B000E0OE1M,"I just read in the paper about this collection and immediately hopped up to the computer and pre-ordered my copy! Here are Brad's top ten reasons that I want to own it and you should too:

10) You know there are some things - works of art, foods, smells, people - that leave such an indelible image on you that every time you come across them you seem to be immersed in a nostalgic haze. Watching these Berkeley films does it to me. I can't always explain it. When I show my VHS copies to friends or students of mine, invariably somebody goes ""what the heck is that?!?"" Berkeley's over-the-top quality has to be experienced to be believed.

9) I don't have ""Dames"" or Golddiggers of 1935"" although I've seen them. I consider them lesser works, but each contains some incredible numbers: ""Dames"" has a catchy title song that was included in the stage production of 42ND STREET and ""1935"" has ""Lullaby of Broadway"" which is a complete musical tragedy in 15 minutes.

8) I don't even know what the extras are, but I can't wait. Extra numbers?

7) Another reviewer hinted at this: it's that Warner Brothers stamp on the musical genre that makes these films so amazing. It's a toughness, a rawness, a gangster film-like quality. It's performances by actors like Jimmy Cagney, Joan Blondell, Aline McMahon and Ginger Rogers that give these films....oh, I'll call it 'moxie!"" And then couple them with the sweetness of Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and the combination can't be beat.

6) The three ""Prologues"" that close FOOTLIGHT PARADE should be seen by everyone. From the soft-porn leering of ""Honeymoon Hotel"" to the aquatic excess of ""By a Waterfall"" to the brilliance of Cagney and Keeler in ""Shanghai Lil"".....I never lose the thrill down my back when I watch them.

5) The chance to see some of the greatest character actors in the Warner Bros. stable strut their stuff, even in tiny parts (i.e. Sterling Holloway as the delivery boy in GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933). Watching Guy Kibbee or Hugh Herbert or Una Merkel or Aline MacMahon or any of the others on screen is a treat.

4) Speaking of  G. of 1933, ""Petting in the Park"" reminds you of what films could show before the Hays Code messed everything up. Another prurient delight from Busby Berkeley's dirty mind. And then ""Shadow Waltz"" shows you how romantic and stirring he could be. Best of all ""My Forgotten Man"" is a must-see at the end of that picture. Berkeley could play with mood as well as anybody. As hilarious as this film is, you never forget that these people are in the middle of a Depression and are always on the verge of starving. Happy ending or not, Berkeley can't let you forget it either. The number is magnificent. The amazing Joan Blondell can sing about as well as Ruby Keeler could tap, and it doesn't matter!!!!!!

3) Did I mention Ruby Keeler's tap-dancing? I work with a lot of tappers in my profession, and nobody ever stepped like her. It's thunderous and awkward and absolutely beautiful. And her voice, which approaches near-bass qualities.....I know it sounds like I'm putting her down, but I love this woman. She makes you smile and breaks your heart, all at the same time.

2) If you absolutely hate musicals (and that means you probably aren't even in this spot on Amazon, reading this, but just on the off chance that you are) then skip over the musical numbers and watch the snappy patter of the dialogue scenes. Cagney in FOOTLIGHT PARADE is Cagney at his best! Watching Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel and the rest of the showgirls engage in witty, bitchy banter in 42ND STREET of G. of 1933 will have you howling.

1) If you love musicals, then I highly recommend these films because they are the works of a true original. Nobody approached musical theatre like Busby Berkeley. It's hard not to feel strongly about him; you could end up hating the guy for his craziness. But I'm betting you won't!",1142726400,28,3880,4.641399416909621
2476491,5,B000E0OE1M,"The rave reviews are flowing in...from THE NEW YORKER...to PLAYBOY MAGAZINE...to DVD websites by the score, everyone's saying this is already a contender for Best DVD of 2006.

Two kinds of films defined Warner Bros. in the 1930s...their fast-paced gangster films, and their Busby Berkeley musical spetaculars. Others tried to imitate the Warner gangster formula and failed. Others tried to imitate the Berkeley formula, but they were missing the essential ingredients: The Warner stock company, great songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, and most important, the incomparable imagination of Busby Berkeley.

A few years ago, Warner Bros. released a great disc of 42nd STREET, the film that made Berkeley a household name. The film had been lovingly restored, and had never looked so good. However, the rest of his great classics awaited the same kind of painstaking restoration, and the day has finally arrived when we can rejoice in owning these sensational, delightful, and mind-boggling fantasy-fests of delight.

Best of all, there are HOURS of extra features, including a bonus disc of more than 20 of Berkeley's musical spectaculars. If all you want is music and dance, without plot, this is like a 1930s, three-hour music video beyond compare!

There are engaging mini-documentaries that illuminate various aspects of these films, which help put each film in historical context. While die-hard buffs would lament the fact that certain ancient documentaries they recall aren't included, it's obvious that such items probably have legal or ownership barriers which could preclude WB's access to those pieces. However, this is not really a concern, for what has been provided here beyond comprehensive, with great quality, and with the same kind of smarts that sets Warner Home Video's product heads and tails above all the other studios when it comes to classics.

So, here's to Busby! To Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell! To an amazing song-and-dance Jimmy Cagney and the always wonderful Joan Blondell....not to mention folks like Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks and so many Warner regulars. You can't pass this up and call yourself a movie lover!",1142380800,21,2139,5.224489795918367
2476492,5,B000E0OE1M,"Hooray for Warner Home Video! Just before the turn of last year - about a week before I learned of the release of this mouth watering set - I said to my wife ""wouldn't it be great if Warners did a Berkeley collection?"" and I went on to tick off the names of the exact titles included in this set.

I first saw FOOTLIGHT PARADE when I was in college in the late 60s; saw it on a big screen in a real movie palace in Minneapolis. It was a revelatory moment and I have been a committed ""Berkeleyite"" ever since.

There is no one during the 30s or after who did such audacious and astounding things with movie musicals.

I look forward to having the DVD set which I know will be a vast improvement over the VHS copies I have mouldering in our attic. Anyone who has a yen for musicals will want to own this set. Not only did Berkeley have the full support (for a while) of Jack Warner in the making of these extravagant films he also had the pick of the Warner stock company of actors. Think of it:Cagney, Blondell, Kibbee, Powell, and lastly but foremeost the Beautiful Ruby Keeler (for who I still harbor a schoolboy crush!). I can only hope that the bonus disc will have numbers from the(lesser)films not included in the set; numbers such as DREAM A LITTLE DREAM from FASHIONS and the numbers from WONDER BAR (even the jaw-dropping GOIN' TO HEAVEN ON A MULE number).

Now if someone (Warners or whoever owns the rights) will release Eddie Cantor's films for Goldwyn - which contain some prime Berkeley work - and also issue a set of Jolson films (which would have to include GO INTO YOUR DANCE - no Berkeley work but great music and (hubba-hubba)Ruby Keeler - everything would truly be right with the world!",1139097600,74,1705,4.369085173501578
2476493,5,B000E0OE1M,"I am sure that I am one of many who are incredibly excited about the upcoming release of these brilliant Busby Berkeley musicals!  Each of these films contain many of the big screen's most unforgettable moments, and all five merit inclusion in this fine DVD package.

For fans of musicals and for those who simply enjoy excellent cinema, these movies have it all!  First and foremost, the artistry of Berkeley's musical sequences  make these films a must-see!  It doesn't matter if you are a musical maven or not.  The inimitable Busby Berkeley production numbers will dazzle you, even with the sound turned down!  In addition to being renowned musicals, these films are also some of the wittiest comedies from the 30's era.  I don't think anybody can resist the well-written snappy dialogue and sly innuendo, particularly from the pre-code releases included here.

My mini-reviews:

FOOTLIGHT PARADE -- Great pre-code dialogue, and a fantastic showcase for the comedic talents of both Joan Blondell and James Cagney, the latter demonstrating his incredible footwork that helped him score his Oscar winning role in Yankee Doodle Dandy!

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 -- My personal favorite of this collection. it features the famous Ginger Rogers number ""We're In The Money"", and the unforgettable ""Forgotten Man"" performed by Joan Blondell!  Great production numbers and more entertaining pre-code comedy.

DAMES -- In addition to the great production number of the title song, it features an hilarious performance by Hugh Herbert, probably (though debatably) his best!

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 -- This one introduces the great production number, ""The Lullaby Of Broadway"" and also features a great comedic performance from Gloria Stuart (of ""Titanic"" fame).

42nd STREET -- This is the film that reinvented the movie musical!  Nuff said, except that Ginger Rogers' chaffing is a wonderful highlight.

The extras look nice, though I'm sorry no commentaries seem to be included.  I'm looking forward to seeing the new featurettes.  All in all, this is a very reasonably priced package that is worth every penny.  Enjoy!",1136505600,133,2108,5.198813056379822
2476513,5,B000E0OE1M,"Excellent boxed set of the early Warner Brother's musical films with Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, even James Cagney in Footlight Parade and Ginger Rogers in Gold Diggers of 1933.  I was talking with my late wife's cousin Judy in Southern California last December after I watched Gold Diggers on Turner Classic,  We talked about the pre-code musical numbers such as Pettin' In the Park with the scantily clad girls, a bit shocking for back in '33 I think.  She got this boxed set, so I did too.  It is terriffic and all the special added features are wonderful pieces of nostalgia from the Great Depression and the 1930s.

All of the actors shine and show off their hoofing skils as they sing and dance their way from the truly silver screen, right into your living room. Joan Blondell's characters are almost always my favorites in these storylines--especially her part as James Cagney's secretary in FOOTLIGHT PARADE.

The audio is well-captured and the images are stable (though there are some jittery moments from time to time, these are very much anomalies and not at all frequent) and clear.

Well-staged, well-presented...these will be performances to share with friends and family for years to come. Don't depend on streaming or TCM...own it soon!",1421539200,5,790,5.253968253968254
2476522,5,B000E0OE1M,"Awesome - this arrived in time for Christmas and with the utter bilge spewed forth by the dictators known as 'broadcasters' for the 'festive' season on television these were a salvation. The quality of the prints and the spectacle within the  films themselves, considering their age, was a joy to behold. Cagney shines in Footlight Parade and Gold Diggers of 1933 is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. The films just seem to make you smile and have a rare quality by simply making you feel happy even in songs about the deppression and the numbers are very catchy- you will be humming them for days. Also because, with exception of Gold Diggers of 1935 (the weakest of the collection but still highly watchable), the films are pre-hays code they can be quite racey but it isn't done in a sleazy way and are just wonderful - check out 'Shanghai Lil' in Footlight and the fantastic 'Pettin in the Park' in Gold Diggers of 1933 to see this achieved well. A delightful collection (and I hate musicals) that are forgotten by many, adored by a few but never equalled . Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell give it there all and it's easy to see why they were the darlings of their era, and quite rightly.

The composer, Harry Warren is a recognized genius and truly one of America's greatest writers of the era.  His music never ages and much of his work is now considered 'American standards'.
Aside from the music, the humor, etc., is dated and naive, but gives a glimpse into what made Americans laugh during a time that is so similar to life in America today.  The Great Depression was at its beginning when these movies were made and it obvious that these films were very escapist for the viewers that could afford to see them.  It was a difficult time for so many people and to watch the actors portray wealthy people enjoying the 'high life' that was care free with trivial problems probably seemed virtually unbelievable in the 30's.

2476591,5,B000E0OE1M,"This is a review for ""The Busby Berkeley Collection"" a box set of  five  Busby Berkeley related musicals issued by Warner Brothers on DVD.  These are the ground breaking musicals made during then depths of the Depression that must've knocked the socks off of anyone who saw them.  Here they are:

42ND STREET (1933) dby Lloyd Bacon w/Busby Berkeley. Warner Baxter, Bebe Daniels, George Brent, Ruby Keeler and another great cast of character actors.
The original let's put on a show and hope we can make a profit  movie, this one has it all. Beautiful women, great show music and an astounding cast of supporting players including Dick Powell, Ginger Rodgers, Guy Kibbee and the show stopping title number,"" 42nd Street,"" which is still an amazing accomplishment. One of the all-time greats.

FOOTLIGHT PARADE (1933). dby Lloyd Bacon w/ Busby Berkeley. James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Frank McHugh. This time James Cagney takes the Warner musical formula for a spin and everyone's a winner. Watchng Cagney go through his paces for this Berkeley extravaganza is a real treat and the climactic number, ""Shanghai Lil"" is a show stopping knock out. Like many of these early WB musicals The Depression and lack of money is a paramount theme but the energy and optimism displayed on screen is something our modern audiences might appreciate.

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 (1933) dby Mervyn LeRoy/Busby Berkeley. Warren William, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler. Unforgetable Depression-era musical featuring ""We're In the Money"" and the classic ""Remember My Forgotten Man."" Possibly some of the most heartfelt performances in any movie musical. Despite it's massive scale GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 still projects a sense of intimacy with some of these numbers which unfortunately are still relevant today. A must see.

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 (1935). dby Busby Berkeley. Dick Powell, Adolph Menjou, Gloria Stuart, Alice Brady, Hugh Herbert. A top grade musical with a  silly story about Alice Brady trying to save money while backing a milk fund benefit at a summer resort. But the highlight is the astounding ""Lullabye of Broadway,"" a gradually darkening musical number with a shocking ending. In this one even the tap dancers are threatening, worth seeing for the ""Lullabye"" alone, but the rest is enjoyable and the music in most of these Berkeley associated performances is outstanding.

DAMES (1934) dby Ray Enright/Busby Berkeley. Joan Blondelll, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Zasu Pitts. Not quite as outstanding as the previous musicals I have mentioned but certainly good enough to watch and enjoy. DAMES stands on its own with numbers like ""Dames,"" ""The Girl At the Ironing board,"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You."" Part of the problem with watching this first Busby Berkeley box set is that there are so many excellent musical performances they tend to run together. But who cares, this first busby Berkeley box set is a great value and it's on sale during the holiday shopping season
at Amazon.
Also included in this box set are documentaries and some wonderful WB cartoons with musical themes that are featured in the above Berkeley films.
Last but not least a highlight disc entitled ""The Busby Berkeley Disc"" is included with this box set and no matter how familiar you might be with the movies I mentioned you just might enjoy seeing these remarkable numbers performed one right after the other.

Considering the age of these films the picture and sound quality is fine, a top quality
set in every way possible. Without a doubt this is a classic collection that any film lover would be happy to own.",1260144000,4,3615,4.996672212978369
2476592,5,B000E0OE1M,"Great to have all these in one package. Saw these originally as a college student in a course 'History of the Movies'...they capture all the cliches: chorus girl succeeds, boy gets girl, etc. Amazing is the fact of what you see is painstakingly real...no computer generated anything here!",1251590400,2,288,5.020833333333333
2476603,5,B000E0OE1M,"This is one of the greatest sets of films ever released.  High quality all the way for these Berkeley films.  My only criticisms are with the extras.  Some of the cartoons on the various discs have had added to the end title ""dubbed version copyright Turner Ent.""  These are cartoons which have been ""restored"" by Turner, although ""ruining"" them might be more appropriate.  More info is available by doing a search of the aforementioned phrase.  In any case, it is completely unacceptable to add this to any film.  If they add it before or after, I will put up with it, but NOT during a film.  Also, the cartoons on GD of 1935 have an annoying PC disclaimer.  Lastly, the removal of the ""Mule"" number on the Busby Berkeley disc is censorship at its worst.  The PC Nation strikes again.  Censorship of a work of art is unacceptable for any reason.",1242432000,4,846,4.5364238410596025
2476604,5,B000E0OE1M,"The Busby Berkeley Collection has five outstanding musicals that showcase the talent of the great Busby Berkeley. There is also a sixth DVD with many extra features. Whether he was directing, designing dance routines or tackling both at the same time, Busby's work was consistently superior to that of his peers. The movies in this collection prove it and the bonus features we get are well done, too.

FOOTLIGHT PARADE--Footlight Parade stars the great Jimmy Cagney, Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell and Dick Powell. The song and dance numbers by Busby Berkeley are nothing short of incredible.

Chester Kent (Jimmy Cagney) is struggling to produce opening numbers onstage just before a movie theater showed an early ""talkie film."" Chester must contend with two swindling bosses and worse yet there's a rat in the company. Meanwhile, Chester's wife Cynthia (Renee Whitney) wants a divorce. Joan Blondell plays Nan Prescott, Chester's devoted secretary; and Claire Dodd is the gold digging Vivian Rich who dates Chester strictly for his money. Ruby Keeler is Bea Thorn, a drab secretary who gets a stunning makeover to try to get into one of the stage shows.

The choreography by Busby Berkeley can't be beat; and the cinematography is unparalleled. Footlight Parade stuns you with some rather good acting, a juicy plot with action and unforgettable musical numbers lavishly created by the immortal Busby Berkeley. I highly recommend this film for aficionados of classic movie musicals.

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933--Gold Diggers of 1933 is another classic. How's about those musical numbers with that Busby Berkeley touch? Look for Ginger Rogers, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, and many more talented actors to make this film so very special.

Three young women try to put on a show but Brad's (Dick Powell's) older brother is against it. There are some laughs, though. The girls con J. Lawrence Bradford (Brad's older brother and trustee of his estate) and his sidekick (the family lawyer) into buying them hats, furs, pet dogs, and even a car!

The movie ends with a spectacular number ""The Forgotten Man."" The singing by Joan Blondell and Etta Moten is superb. You see veterans marching after coming home from war; but then you see the same men standing on breadlines and being chased by police when they have nowhere to sleep but the sidewalk. Busby Berkeley's military experience helped him design these musical numbers. Very sad; but it's all wonderfully done!

Other great numbers in Gold Diggers of 1933 are the opening number of ""We're In The Money"" and ""Pettin' In The Park,"" which was extremely racy for its time. You will love these numbers!

DAMES--Dames is an outstanding musical with more Busby Berkeley numbers. Indeed, this lavish musical gets its strength from incredibly wonderful song and dance numbers.

Ezra Ounce (Hugh Herbert), a stuffy older multimillionaire, comes to New York to create a foundation against the ""filthy"" Broadway shows--and give his relative Horace Peter Hemingway (Guy Kibbee) ten million dollars for being a ""pure man."" Horace's daughter Barbara (Ruby Keeler) falls in love with her 13th cousin Jimmy Higgens (Dick Powell). Barbara is encouraged by her parents Horace and Matilda (Zasu Pitts) to stay away from Jimmy and avoid a part in the show Jimmy wants to put on Broadway; but Barbara's not about to listen.

Jimmy gets a backer--who gives him a bad check. Leave it to Mabel Anderson (Joan Blondell) to get Horace to back the show despite the wishes of his relative Ezra.

The last thirty minutes or so is song and dance heaven! Nobody but Busby Berkeley could put together those beautiful, intricate and sophisticated numbers with all those beautiful women and make it look as easy as cake. Berkeley's choreography couldn't have been better. In addition, the ballad ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" was written for this film--and Dick Powell sings it flawlessly.

GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935--Gold Diggers Of 1935 provides action mixed with stunning song and dance numbers than several musicals combined! Busby Berkeley directed and choreographed these numbers.

We first see employees gathering for the opening of a new posh hotel, The Wentworth Plaza in New England. Dick Curtis (Dick Powell) and his fiance Arline Davis (Dorothy Dare) work at the hotel. Mrs. Matilda Prentiss (Alice Brady) is a hotel guest who counts every red cent despite having millions; and her poor daughter Ann is engaged to a stuffy older man named T. Mosely Thorpe III (Hugh Herbert) who also stays at the hotel. Humbolt Prentiss, (Frank McHugh), an irresponsible playboy, is vacationing with them.

Ann wants some fun before she marries Mosely; and with much hesitation her mother Matilda allows it--on the condition that hotel clerk Dick Curtis is her escort. Ann and Dick soon become romantically involved much to the chagrin of Mrs. Prentiss. Arline catches Dick kissing Ann but she herself has fallen for Humbolt Prentiss so she lets Dick off the hook rather gracefully.

From the managers who steal tips from the bellhops to the stenographer who plots and schemes greedily against Mosely, there's quite a bit of game playing. Adolph Menjou plays Nicolai Nicoleff, an oddball theatrical type who mooches off the hotel; and his buddy August Schultz (Joseph Cawthorn) wants his share of ""the take"" when Mrs. Prentiss puts on her annual benefit show for the Milk Fund.

Gold Diggers of 1935 is one of those rare gems that couldn't ever lose its appeal. The stunning musical numbers remain stay with you after you watch this; and you'll be thrilled with the ""Lullaby Of Broadway"" sequence near the end of the film.

42nd STREET--This movie was hot stuff then; but the story is great entertainment even today. Director Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter)is going to put on a show; his bosses think they can do it despite the Great Depression. Julian assembles his troupers including Bebe Daniels as Broadway star Dorothy Brock; Ruby Keeler as Peggy Sawyer, the chorus girl; and actor Billy Lawler (Dick Powell). Guy Kibbee plays Abner Dillon, the wealthy old man who is funding the show on the condition that Dorothy Brock, his love interest, stars in the show.

Julian runs his troupe to death and despite doctor's orders he still runs the show anyway. Dorothy Brock encounters trouble when Abner wants more romantic time with her; but what Dorothy wants is time with her real love, Pat Denning (George Brent). Peggy Sawyer almost loses strength but she rallies, fortunately. Will she rise to the ultimate occasion?

Then there are the Busby Berkeley song and dance numbers. The music by Harry Warren glisten like gold. You get a great duet for ""I'm Young And Healthy;"" and there's the classic ""Shuffle Off To Buffalo."" Of course we can't forget the show stopping ""42nd Street"" either. Excellent! The choreography really shines during these musical numbers with great aerial views of the cast on stage and the dancing couldn't be better.

The sixth DVD, as you may know, has a plethora of extras even though, as some reviewers noted, it didn't please everyone. It pleased me, though! We do get musical numbers from these films as well as numbers from films including Fashions of 1934, Wonder Bar, In Caliente, and Gold Diggers of 1937. The vintage cartoons are OK; but I preferred the featurette that told the story of how 42nd Street went from book to screen to stage.

Overall, The Busby Berkeley Collection packs a wallop and I highly recommend this for his fans. People who love classic Hollywood musicals will not be disappointed, either.",1235606400,2,7551,5.005582137161085
2476605,4,B000E0OE1M,"I am an avid movie buff of Busby Berkeley films which I compare with todays movies. The story lines and dialogue were in their infancy, but in today's society I find them infantile.

How hard the actors and actresses worked doing all their own stunts - singing, dancing, swimming, whatever the part required they did it. I revere the early hollywood stars, they appear to have a healthy respect for themselves and others, which is not something many of the stars appear to have today.",1224115200,2,484,4.694117647058824

I have had all of the films on video, mostly recorded from the television over the years, but I am so glad I bought this box set, which shows the films off to the best advantage, in brilliant condition; so clear and 'new' looking that it's like seeing newly made versions of old favourites!

To top it all, the compilation DVD of Berkley's best numbers is just superb, and a great 'time filler' when there's nothing worth watching on the telly.  It is worth the price on its own, especially as it contains 'Spin a Little Web of Dreams' and 'Don't say good night', which are not available in any other form.  Pity they saw fit to exclude 'Going to Heaven on a mule' this time round though: that's really my only gripe.

It's great to have these DVD's, and so cheap too.  One word of advice: if you live in UK then buy them through Amazon America rather than second-hand through Amazon UK: they will work out cheaper, and still only took a week and 1/2 to arrive.

While the plot lines and characters are often simple and predictable, we watch these movies for the music and dance scenes. They are truly amazing. For one person to have created these scenes entirely from their own imagination is awesome. The apotheosis of Berkeley is, for us, ""Lullaby of Broadway"", full of great, powerful images. Of course, the ""By a Waterfall"" water ballet is a great breakthrough, and just plain fun. The many ""girls with violins"" or ""girls with pianos"" are fantastic dream images. And, who can forget Ginger Rogers singing ""We're In The Money"" in pig-latin?

As one of those baby boomers that never disrespected my elders accomplishments this was just the collection I was looking for.  Their music was better, their acting was better, and I think in a way, their lives.  My parents worked hard, lived during the Depression, faught in WWII, and all the while enjoyed life.  No 65 hour work weeks for them and they did have and go to many parties.  Probably more than I ever will.  Anyway, these shows on this collection lets me live some of that time with them.

Technically the sound is perfect, the same for the video.  Not sure, but these may have been remastered.  If you enjoy music you can understand and have ever enjoyed a good play, buy this collection.",1184630400,4,834,4.506666666666667

Again, the dance numbers are the standouts and the reason for purchase, though the plots are better than the average musical.
  However, none of the plots are going to hold you quite like the big numbers. The remarkable showpiece presentations will be the thing that has you going back to this set time and time again.

2476630,5,B000E0OE1M,"I had never seen a Busby Berkeley musical before I got this boxed set, and I must say that the whole experience was a pleasant surprise. It took time to get used to Ruby Keeler as a romantic and musical lead, but after watching for awhile she and Dick Powell get to be quite enchanting. To really appreciate these films you have to understand two things. First, these films were made as pure Depression era escapism. Thus there is plenty of comedy, memorable music, and visually stunning choreography. Just don't expect films with complex or even believable plots. Second, although these films are all backstage musicals, you just have to accept the fact that it would be impossible for a theatrical performance to provide the sets and the views necessary to appreciate any of the numbers and just enjoy the movies. The following movies are included in the collection:

42nd Street - The first talkies had a generous helping of musicals, unfortunately the vast majority of them were bad - bad music, bad acting, inane plots, and poor production standards in general. Thus by 1931 the public was fed up with musicals, and this was the movie that brought the genre back in vogue after two years of exile. Of course the best number is the title number, which I find impossible to get out of my head, but ""Shuffle of To Buffalo"" is great too. Ginger Rogers gives us a glimpse of the greatness that is to be as she plays a chorus girl with a fake British accent and monacle looking for a big break. Extra features are:
3 Vintage Featurettes: Harry Warren: America's Foremost Composer, Hollywood Newsreel, A Trip Through a Hollywood Studio
Notes on Busby Berkeley

""Gold Diggers of 1933"" - This is supposed to be a pseudo-remake of 1929's ""Gold Diggers of Broadway"", except in the four year interim the Great Depression is in full swing and our gold diggers have hit on bad times like everyone else. The second Berkeley film in the series starts off with Ginger Rogers singing ""We're in the Money"" in an outrageous number in which the chorus girls are all dressed in oversized coins. As Ginger sings part of the number in pig-Latin, the whole thing seems surreal, and in a way it is. The sheriff breaks in on the number to repossess everything on the set to settle the debts of the show's producer, and the gold diggers are out of work again. Dick Powell comes to their rescue when he comes up with the money to finance a new show. The girls think he is a bank robber on the run, but in fact he is a young man from a wealthy family who is hiding his work in the theatre from his old-money relatives who soon arrive to reclaim him. There's some great pre-code comedy here from Joan Blondell, not to mention her stirring performance of ""Forgotten Man"" about World War I soldiers who are now marching in Depression Era bread lines. Also not to be missed is ""Shadow Waltz"" with the chorus girls playing fake flourescent violins that would occasionally short out and shock the girls. Extra features are:
2 New Featurettes: Good Diggers: FDR's New Deal...Broadway Bound, 42nd Street: From Book to Stage to Screen
3 Vintage Featurettes: Rambling 'Round Radio Show #2, Seasoned Greatings, The 42nd Street Special
3 Vintage Cartoons: I've Got to Sing a Torch Song, Pettin' in the Park, We're in the Money
Busby Berkeley Musicals Trailer Gallery

""Footlight Parade"" - This 1933 film stars James Cagney as a producer of Broadway musicals who seems to have been put out of work by the new craze of talking pictures. Thus it is the first of Berkeley's films to not be set in the Depression. When Cagney's character learns that talkie audiences are being entertained by live musical numbers called ""prologues"" he gets the brilliant idea of going into the musical prologue business himself. Unfortunately, he has to deal with a competitor who is stealing his ideas, partners that are cheating him, and a new girlfriend that is not what she seems to be. This film comes closer to having a full-fledged plot than the others, and Cagney gives both a strong dramatic performance and a great musical one as he shows off his dancing prowess in the number ""Shanghai Lil"". The goof in this picture is that this film is supposed to be set in the late 20's, yet the men in this number organize to appear as the NRA Eagle and then reassemble with flash cards to produce an image of FDR...five years before he is even President and thus before the NRA even exists. But then, a flash card image of then-President Calvin Coolidge would have just not been that inspiring. The most memorable number is ""By a Waterfall"" with the chorus girls all doing impressive geometric patterns in a pool that sports a three-story fountain. Extra features are:
New Featurette - ""Footlight Parade: Music for the Decades""
2 Vintage Featurettes: Rambling 'Round Radio Row #8, Vaudeville Reel #1

Theatrical Trailer

""Dames"" - This 1934 film is weaker than the previous three, but has the best comic performances from both Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert of any of their Berkeley films. The premise is that wealthy puritan Ezra Ounce (Herbert) is going to bequeath ten million dollars of his fortune to his cousin Horace Hemmingway (Kibbee) provided that he is an upright moral man. Unfortunately, on the train back to his home, Horace finds a chorus girl (Joan Blondell) stowing away in his compartment. She threatens to scream if he has her removed. Afraid of what his cousin will think, he agrees to let her stay there overnight. She later uses this to blackmail Horace into backing the show of ""bad seed"" of the family, James Higgens (Dick Powell), who has been exiled from the family by Ezra because of his Broadway ties. Again, there is some great pre-code comedy from Joan Blondell as she continuously puts Kibbee's character in compromising situations. Also, the number ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" is wonderfully performed by Dick Powell along with some stunning choreography by Berkeley. The extra features are:
New Featurette - ""Busby Berkeley's Kaleidoscopic Eyes""

2 Vintage Cartoons: I Only Have Eyes for You, Those Beautiful Dames

""Gold Diggers of 1935"" - This is the weakest film of the bunch as it is missing the cast of characters that have become familiar in the past Berkeley films - Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, and Guy Kibbee. On top of that, the now strict enforcement of the Hays code really inhibits what has worked in the past for the Berkeley musicals. However, Adolphe Menjou is a great addition to the cast as a gold digger in his own rights. He plays a dance director who agrees to work off his debts to a swank hotel in return for being dance director for the annual musical put on at the hotel for charity. Dick Powell plays a medical student working at the hotel who agrees to chaperone the daughter of a wealthy but stingy matron. To make up for the fact that pre-code dialogue and numbers are no longer possible, Berkeley delivers perhaps his most memorable number to the tune of one of the most memorable songs of his series of movies - ""Lullaby of Broadway"". The whole number has a surreal and even noirish quality to it as it tells the tale of a ""Broadway baby"" who sleeps all day and plays all night and her tragic end. The extra features are:

They include the title songs from ""42nd Street"" and ""Dames"",  plus ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo"", ""You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me,"" ""Pettin' in the Park,"" ""Shadow Waltz"", ""Remember My Forgotten Man,"" ""Honeymoon Hotel,"" ""Shanghai Lil"",  ""I Only Have Eyes For You,"" ""The Words Are In My Heart,"" and the incomparable ""By a Waterfall"" and the Oscar-winning ""Lullaby of Broadway"".  They are all both products of the Depression and ageless exercises in pure style.  The numbers are mind-boggling; how did Berkeley do it?  This is way beyond Astaire and Rogers doing a perfection dance number.  Berkeley takes his camera under water and literally through the studio roof and does all sorts of gymnastics with the camera.

The casts are interchangeable and fabulous:  Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, Warren William, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, James Cagney, Bebe Daniels, Warner Baxter, Adolphe Menjou, Glenda Farrell, Aline MacMahon, Gloria Stuart, Alice Brady, George Brent, and a couple of hundred chorus girls in each film's climax.  Get acquainted with this Warners contract player roster.  Watch for them in other movies.

But what stuns me is how entertaining and first-rate the plots are in these five movies.  They do follow a formula--putting on a Broadway show, staging ""prologues"" that went before or between movies in big cities of the early 1930's, stage professionals fight a moral decency group to put on their show, poor boy Dick Powell wants to marry either poor Ruby Keeler or wealthy Gloria Stuart (62 years before James Cameron's TITANIC) despite a mother who won't hear of it.  The plots are fun, with witty dialogue and romantic scenes and lesser songs in the middle of the movie before the big climax.

There is more because this is a Warner Home Video boxed set--five new featurettes with directors and critics praising the Berkeley style; no less than 13 original era musical or comedy shorts; nine classic cartoons; theatrical trailers and radio spots.  You are not getting a movie, but rather a full three hour 1932 or 1933 or 1934 or 1935 Night at the Movies with each disc.  Or longer, if you need two nights per disc.  Too bad the other video companies choose not to include bonuses like this, but only five movies, in the same price range.  Warner Home Video could teach Universal Home Video, in particular, some packaging lessons.

Do check out THE BUSBY BERKELEY COLLECTION--and show at least part of THE BUSBY BERKELEY DISC to any friend who does not know his choreography genius.  It is a fabulous, scintillating, romantic, and tuneful gem of a DVD boxed set.  Great movies, great stars, great stories, great musical numbers, and fun bonus material from the era.

Berkeley's astonishing genius is admirably conveyed by the various expert commentaries --- except that even their unbounded enthusiasm seems to fall short of the man's towering vision, and staggering achievement. Berkeley didn't just think in three dimensions: he seems to have worked in at least ten. Time, space, motion, design, contrast, beauty, drama, humour, political and social commentary, music, rhythm, dance and song. The list could go on. The films add up to the finest possible summary of the state of the Western world in the 1930s --- a decade of both despair and determination. Sublime.",1160092800,6,1240,5.053658536585366

The best thing in this collection is the Busby Berkeley disc - all the musical numbers neatly arranged in a row, including some from the films that are not included in the set (Wonder Bar and In Caliente).

2476682,5,B000E0OE1M,"Busby Berkeley influenced movie musical making in a big way. His choreography really transformed popular music into an extravaganza. The films included in this collection truly embody the beginnings of movie musicals and one of the best times for films period.

First, there is 42nd Street, a wonderful film with an excellent cast and great music. When a hardened star (Bebe Daniels) has an accident, an innocent hoofer (Ruby Keeler) goes on in her place. ""Young and Healthy,"" ""Shuffle off to Buffalo,"" and ""42nd Street"" end the film with a punch.

Gold Diggers of 1933 is the best film of the bunch. Not only does it address the Depression (with a grand finale called ""My Forgotten Man""), it shows off the glitz and glamour of Hollywood with beautiful girls. Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Aline MacMahone scam some highbrows for trying to get them to stay away from their brother (Dick Powell). This one features some of the most risque and outstanding music sequences including ""We're in the Money,"" ""Pettin' in the Park,"" and ""In the Shadows.""

Footlight Parade includes a star in his own right into a medium he was only familiar with on the stage: James Cagney. He plays the boss of a company that makes prologues for films. Starring most of the usual cast, this movie's highlight is the magical finale with ""Honeymoon Hotel,"" ""By a Waterfall,"" and ""Shanghai Lil.""

Dames focuses on the older characters with a family feud involving Zasu Pitts and Guy Kibbee over the youngsters Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and ""Dames"" get your toes tapping and your mouth watering.

Gold Diggers of 1935 is a weaker film compared to its predecessor, but it is good in its own way. Dick Powell plays chaperone to the beautiful Gloria Stuart and performs in a musical with numbers like ""The Words are in my Heart"" and ""Lullaby of Broadway.""

The final disk features all the musical numbers from the aforementioned films and more from others. This is nice to use to convert friends to fans of these early musicals. It is hard to resist getting kaleidoscope eyes.

Each disk contains extra features, some with featurettes and most with Merry Melody cartoons featuring songs from the films.",1150416000,,2203,4.827586206896552
2476683,4,B000E0OE1M,"I absolutely love this set- I've been waiting for something like it for years.  The transfers are pristine, the sets are gorgeous, and the films are tremendous fun. I left a star off, though, for a couple of reasons.  First, I think the Al Jolson song 'Goin' to Heaven on a Mule' should have been included.  I disagree with another reviewer who said it was left off because of the 'political correctness' crowd. Let's face it- the scene is entirely racist and offensive.  I'm black and I can watch ""The Green Pastures"" while hardly squirming, but the Jolson bit makes me want to take a bath in sulphuric acid.  Nevertheless, it's as much a part of film history as ""The Eternal Jew"" and ""Birth of a Nation"", and it needs to be seen, if only for people to know how insulting it really is.  I teach college, and many of my students do not understand what racism was like, once upon a time- scenes like the Jolson clip make it clear how bad earlier times could be.

My other quibble is that there should have been commentaries, especially for ""Footlight Parade"" and ""Golddiggers of 1933"", and possibly for ""42nd Street"".  These movies cry out for annotations by film historians. I would even have loved someone like John Waters discussing the impact of these films on queer sensibility and camp- for many lesbians for instance, these movies are a rare treat (how often do you get to see half-naked gorgeous women take bubble baths?), or Elvis Mitchell dicussing ideas of race and ethnicity (that line about 'gleaming white bodies' in ""Footlight Parade"" always makes me gag, and I still don't know what to make of Ruby Keeler as a China doll). Or, for a change, how about some feminist film historians talking about the impact of Berkeley's style on the idea of female perfection and interchangeability, wherein women become akin to icons, goddesses, or even machine parts? That would have been a lot of fun, and akin to what was done in the two Film Archives sets.",1146096000,27,1960,4.644508670520231

The quality of the DVDs is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed, if some of these extras are not to one's taste, then fair enough, but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature.

It is a shame that the Al Jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced, but today's political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll.  That said, we are left with a plethora of magnificence from Busby Berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations.

By Brendan G Carroll

While I was delighted that Warners & Turner have issued these great films on DVD at last in terrific quality (for the most part) and with wonderful extras, there were some opportunities missed here and one glaring omission which I hope I can set right.

The opportunities lost concern the archive material that might have been included and which would have been so worth the effort to acquire. As most Berkeley buffs know, he gave a very interesting and rare interview for a 1966 TV documentary called ""The Movie Crazy Years"" (about Warners) which also included a nice interview with Joan Blondell. It would have been good to see the relevant excerpts from this superb programme (which I think was made by David Wolper) included in the various featurettes on these DVDs, rather than the endless gushy on-camera posturings of the likes of John Landis. Do I really need to be told over and over in hyper-gushy language, that Buzz was a genius, by so-called celebrity fans? I really wish Turner would at least include either contemporary witnesses or film historians (like Bob Thomas or Rudy Behlmer) to add pertinent commentary to projects like this. WHAT has John Waters got to do with Busby Berkeley I ask you?

The second ""missed opportunity"" is the rarely (and barely) seen 96 minute documentary ""Busby Berkeley"" made by Russ Jones in 1974 to co-incide with the publication of Tony Thomas' superb biography of Buzz, which included rare interviews with Winifred Shaw (about the Lullaby of Broadway number) and Ruth Donnelly (about Footlight Parade) among other treasures.

Surely Turner could have acquired both of these archive resources (at little cost!) for this definitive DVD set? It would have added such tremendous historic value to the collection and genuine insight. I really felt we never got to know much about Berkeley as a man from any of the short documentaries or how he achieved his amazing effects. In fact, I realised that I knew more about him and his techniques, than I learned from any of the featurettes.

Much worse though, is the total absence of any comment about Ray Heindorf, the genius arranger and orchestrator at Warners, from 1931 on,  who was responsible for the entire musical style of these films and especially the superb job he turned in for the big numbers - creating seamless 10-15 minute arrangements of Harry Warren's great songs (and those of Kahal & Fain - they wrote `By A Waterfall' by the way,  not that you would know it from watching the short documentary on Footlight Parade!!).

Heindorf was also responsible for the marvellous, brassy orchestrations throughout - yet he never even gets a mention. He was a genius - in fact, according to Erich Wolfgang Korngold, (as told me by Eleanor Aller & Harry Warren himself) he was the best and fastest orchestrator Korngold had ever encountered, high praise indeed from maybe the one man in Hollywod who would know - and it was Heindorf's ability to provide an endlessly varied treatment of each song that allowed Berkeley to get away with making a number lasting a quarter of an hour without we, the viewer (and listener) ever getting bored with the tune!

Well, in spite of these shortcomings, it is wonderful to have these at last in better than average prints (and in the case of 42nd Street, amazing prints!) and of course, the historic trailers & shorts are all marvellous to have at last, rescued from the vaults.

However, I hope next time Turner puts out a major collection, somebody will take the trouble to produce a tribute to Ray Heindorf. It's long overdue.",1144454400,102,3612,4.847402597402597
2476686,5,B000E0OE1M,"This is a great value package of a set of timeless films. The prints are by far the best which have ever been available. All superlatives apply but here a some individual comments:

- Ruby Keeler's ingenue roles are hardly demanding of superior acting abilities.  However, it must be noted how quickly she improved.  By ""Footlight Parade"", the third in the series, she plays with tongue firmly in cheek and with a humour rarely acknowledged. She is charming and competent.  Her dancing has improved too. Note that when she has a chance, however small, to dance other than the heavy tap in which she specialised, she is much lighter of foot than given credit.  Watch her skip along the train in ""Shuffle off to Buffalo"" or sway at the beginning of ""Shadow Waltz"".
- ""Footlight Parade"" probably has the best overall script. Joan Blondell was always outstanding and her rapport with Cagney is superb.  They made many films together and they are a beautifully balanced team, he all bluster and energy, she more subdued, sarcastic but loving.
- All the supporting casts are brilliant but Aline MacMahon in ""Golddiggers of 33"", Guy Kibbee in both ""42nd Street"" and ""Golddiggers of 33"" and Ruth Donnelly in ""Footlight Parade"" are particularly worth noting.
- In ""Forty Second Street"", both Warner Baxter and Bebe Daniels, two of the most experienced star film actors in the whole series, give powerful and moving performances.  This film has a tough urgent mood which has not dated.
- The effect of the Production Code is noticeable.  While the scripts of the first 3 films would survive on their own, the later films have all the ideas but none of the bite.  Note, how funny Hugh Herbert is in ""Footlight Parade"", pre-code, and how irritating he is in ""Dames"", post-code.  Also, in ""Dames"", Joan Blondell's golddigger has lost her sense of humour.  She is  venal but lacks the warmth and humour of the earlier films.
- ""The Lady in Red"" number from ""In Caliente"" shows the influence of the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers films, even to the inclusion of the irritating presence of Edward Everett Horton.  The ballroom dancing is excellent but Judy Canova is awful.
- Wini Shaw has a marvellous torchy voice and a sexy presence.  Her renditions of ""Lullaby of Broadway"" and ""The Lady in Red"" are memorable.
- Most of the songs benefit from superb orchestrations and it is extraordinary that with so many choruses, none of the songs become repetitive and tedious.  The output of Warren and Dubin produced so many hits, one after the other - personal favourite ""I only have eyes for You"".
- The Warner Brothers cartoons attached to individual songs are marvellous examples of 30s animation.  It would be interesting to see the reaction of young children today to these delightful creations.
- The commentaries, while split between the individual films, provide a suitable context for the films, particularly with the rise of Roosevelt and the New Deal.  They are interesting enough but most are rather ""wet"" and one reviewer is very camp in the worst sense - completely over the top.  If you listen, you will realise he actually doesn't tell you anything!

Do yourself a favour and purchase this set as soon as possible.",1144368000,15,3206,4.8388278388278385
2476687,5,B000E0OE1M,"Excellent set of classic Busby Berkeley musicals. Only thing missing is some good commentary tracks. A full length in depth documentary (rather than those short, mostly useless, ""featurettes"")would have also been welcomed. Another note, Warner HV removed the Al Jolson GOIN' TO HEAVEN ON A MULE production number from the bonus compliation disk. This was previously included on the former laser disc version. I am sure that Warner HV was afraid of possible ""policically incorrect"" criticism. A troubling trend. Still excellent as is. Recommended!",1144195200,13,546,5.511904761904762
2476688,5,B000E0OE1M,"Getting this box set was like opening a package on Christmas morning.  I was like a little kid.

The best example of how good these transfers look: when Wini Shaw's face is isolated on the black screen during ""Lullaby of Broadway"" in GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935, she's not surrounded by dirt, speckles, and fuzziness...but instead by inky, spooky blackness.  I've seen this movie maybe 10 times--in theaters as well as on video, and have never seen it look like this.

For those who love these movies, but have been suffering through the old VHS tapes (or even the laserdiscs--the FOOTLIGHT PARADE laserdisc had terrible audio, all of which has been cleaned up nicely here), these DVDs are simply an essential purchase.  Dont call yourself a film buff and tell me you haven't seen GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933...you're not a film buff.

OK, so, some nitpicky things:  The featurettes mean well, but except for John Landis and the hilarious John Waters, it's all historians and fans talking in draining purple prose (""...this was the most amazing thing anybody anywhere had ever seen in the universe...""  etc etc).  No commentaries?  These films CRY OUT for them.  I would have done it for free.

If you really want to learn about Berkeley, you'll still need to read the definitive ""Busby Berkeley Book"" (easy to find used copies).  You should also look for the documentary ""Busby Berkeley: Goin Through the Roof,"" which interviews Esther Williams and lots of the old chorus girls--an utterly fascinating film.

Has anyone ever really interviewed Gloria Stuart about Berkeley?  I spoke with Ms. Stuart at a book signing once, and she had nice memories of him (she worked with him twice--on GD of 1935, plus ROMAN SCANDALS).  I know Warners probably didn't have the budget to track down every living person who worked with Berkeley, but it would have been nice to at least have included some old archived interviews with his contemporaries.

Also--there exists an audio outtake of Ginger Rogers singing ""I've Got To Sing A Torch Song"" in GD of 1933.  That would have been a cool extra.  (Hmmm..I think I finally found where that number was cut out.  Right at the beginning of the nightclub sequence, in long shot between two giant letters, you can clearly see Rogers performing a song at a piano.  Close-up stills of that very scene were used on the front of that song's sheet music.  The transfer is so good you can SEE this kind of detail now!).

One other TINY nitpick:  Removing ""Goin To Heaven on A Mule"" from the bonus compilation disc.  I know why they cut it, but it's still a shame because it has some gorgeous shots amidst the offensive subject matter.

Thanks, Warners, for this package.  I'm excited to learn there is an audience out there as crazy about these 5 movies as I am.",1143331200,18,2773,4.734864300626305
2476689,4,B000E0OE1M,"If anyone owns the Laser disk of the ""Busby Berkley Disk"" - it is now worth more money now than before the warner release of the DVD. Warner had chosen to ""Cut"" a selection form the dvd called ""Go'in to Heaven of a Mule"" by Al Jolsen.

The deleted cut contained a horrible example of racism. The worst I have ever seen, with an almost 99% white cast in black face going to heaven that has a Lenox ave, a segregated ""Black"" heaven with NO whites anywhere to be seen.

Black faced angels rushing over to get a piece of fried chicken from a machine that receives a whole chiken and comes out the other end fried in a matter of seconds. I kid you not!. If thats not bad enough-Baby black faced angeles lowered on wires,swoop down around a ""watermelon Tree"" plucking whole watermelons to their utter delight. Another scene had a 10 foot watermelon open in eight slices and from the center a blackfaced dancer pops out and did some kind of tap sexy dance. WOW! really disgusting and horrible dipictions of black sterotypes from early cinima. Please remember that this was not considered racist in the time period it was made.

Now that you know what you are missing, Collectors need to know that they should have permission to archive this selection and the movie ""Wonderbar"" It is part of american history, if only to document the shameful dipictions of blacks.

Really folks- this selction had to be seen to be belived! It is far worse than anything you might see from anyother source. However we should have the opportunity to see for historical interest, the best and worst cinima has to offer.

Warners was working with the very best source materials -- most of the prints they used are stunning considering their age, with only the occasional age remnant (scatch or slight deterioration). Best of all, hidden among this embarassment of riches in the many special features is a eye-popping transfer of the 1934 WB short Good Morning Eve ... the very first short in the new three-color Technicolor process (four months before La Cucharacha).  The colors are as vivid and rich as they were 72 years ago!  Okay, so the modern ""featurettes"" are schlocky and add little value -- who cares when the films and the shorts are as good as these.

The Storys are more or less similar with the same cast like Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler. The stories can be looks a little bit lame (for younger People) but very spectacular are the Musical numbers. Spectacular because: the choreography are amazing, with a great camera work (filmed often from the Roof of the Sound stages). And there are often not only female dancers - there are also dancing pianos and (neo-light)-violines.

From the technical point it was very difficult to film all those Scenes with big cameras and a Scene needed a lot light. So it's amazing to see those neo-light violines in the dark. They we're simply: ground-breaking.

My very favorite Musical number is ""Lullaby of Broadway"" in ""Gold Diggers of 1935"" with 100 tap dancers in one Scene.
