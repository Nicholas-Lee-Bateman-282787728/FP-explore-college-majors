328246,5,6301264177,"I first saw this at the theatre and laughed so hard I had to see it a 2nd time to catch what I had missed.
It's a very clever take-off on the Sherlock Holmes/Dr. Watson idea. Watson (Ben Kingsley) is the brains and author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Michael Caines is an out-of-work actor who is hired to play Sherlock Holmes after lots of public demand to meet the hero of the stories. What follows is a hilarious and well-crafted story of Caine being forced to really be Sherlock Holmes. He stinks at it, of course, but almost succeeds despite himself.
Kingsley & Caine are wonderful. I can't image any other actors who could have pulled it off with such subtle humor. They play off each other well.
When (I refuse to say ""if"") this comes out on DVD I will buy it! Until then, I hope my VHS doesn't wear out.",1022630400,7,814,4.326797385620915
328247,5,6301264177,"I despise those movies that make their jokes in such a way that it seems as though the director is sitting right next to you, elbowing you and shouting ""Get it?  It was a joke!"" every few seconds.  (I am thinking of such nonsense as Ace Ventura or Austin Powers.)  ""Without a Clue"" is NOT one of those movies.
Crafted with loving care and dedication to detail, it is a hypothetical examination of a literary legend: What we, Doyle's readers, have not known for years is that Dr. Watson is the brilliant crime-fighter.  But for reasons of reputation and ethics, he hides behind the great brain of Sherlock Holmes.  The problem was that Holmes was a name he made up, and when the public wanted to meet this great man, Watson quickly found an un-employed drunken sod to stand in as Holmes.  Now he's stuck with the lout as his partner (nay, LEADER) in crime-solving.
The beauty in this movie lies in the fact that its humor is so superbly subtle, and runs consistent throughout the movie.  Hilarious zingers are being thrown at the audience right and left, most of which will never be caught by those whose tastes run in more mundane circles.
Never over-the-top, never too bizarre to be believable (Hi, Mr. Carrey), Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine form a beautiful odd-couple combination.  Their ""it-should-have-won-awards"" acting is deftly directed by Thom Eberhardt based on a beautiful script by Garry Murphy and Larry Strawther.  Supported by Peter Cook (""Mawwige!""), Jeffrey Jones (the sadistic principal of ""Ferris Beuller""), and featuring Paul Freeman (Belloq of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") as the evil Moriarty, the whole film plays not as a satire of the Doyle stories; rather, one gets the feeling the cast and crew are secretly in love with the Holmes legacy, and this is their way of paying a humorous homage to it.
With the exception of one scantily clad leg, it's appropriate for the entire family.",1011312000,4,1907,4.789634146341464

328334,5,6301264177,"Review of Without a Clue
Hot Toasty Rag, December 2, 2017

As the taglines says, watch Without a Clue to meet the worlds greatest detective, and his bumbling partner. Its a film with the famed literary detective duo, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but in this version, its Dr. Watson whos the genius. Sherlock Holmes is an idiot!

I absolutely love this movie, and I cant recommend it highly enough. Even if youve never seen a Sherlock Holmes movie or read a story, youll still love it. The jokes are both clever and hilarious, which is a rare and welcomed combination. In the entire 107-minute running time, there might have been a collective ten minutes in which I wasn't laughing myself silly. Several times I had to press pause and guffaw, waiting to resume the film until Id composed myself. Thank you Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther for writing such a side-splittingly funny movie.

A perfectly hysterical script is a good start, but if bad actors with lousy timing deliver the lines, the movie will be terrible. Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley have a wonderful chemistry together, and they both add so much to their roles. While anyone else might play Sherlock Holmes as an ordinary doofus, Michael Caine puts himself in the moment so the blunders are really unintentional. He isn't playing dumb; he means well and happens to be stupid. Im convinced anyone else cast as Dr. Watson would have played him with more of an angry, jealous, resentful edge. Ben Kingsley is enormously kind, so even when hes frustrated with Michael Caine, the audience can tell hes still a caring person and enjoys his rapport with his lesser half.

When they're attacked by Paul Freemans henchman, Michael Caine gets really upset and worried. Ben Kingsley reassures him that he isn't the real target because Paul is only trying to stop the smarter of the two. He knows you're an idiot, he says, with only good intentions behind the remark. Theres a beat before Michael Caines response, and the audience thinks hell certainly take offense, but instead he sighs, Oh, thank God! Its one of my favorite jokes in the film, since it shows the adorable combination of sweetness and comedy that runs through the script.

If youve had a bad day, Without a Clue will cheer you up. If youve had a good day, Without a Clue will make it better. Do yourself a favor and buy a copy. Renting it once won't be enough.",1512172800,,2384,4.69377990430622

328363,5,6301264177,"One of my favorite comedies.

The best thing about this movie is the way Kingsley and Caine play off each other. In Caine's biography he mentioned that he had one of the best times acting on this film - and it comes through in every scene he's in.

Clever wordplay comedy, literary jokes about Sherlock Holmes, and even expressions from the background characters make this funny to watch repeatedly. That would be enough of a reason to love it, but then Mancini creates one of the best film scores ever to go along with it that matches the pace, humor, and (limited) emotion to a T.

The comedy is predictable but delivered in with off-handed charm by its stars. My favourite being when Watson reveals to Greenhough (Peter Cook) editor of the Strand magazine, which publishes the Sherlock Holmes stories, that his Sherlock Holmes character is a fraud, an actor he used as a front for his own inimitable sleuthing skills. Peter Cook is outraged and tells Watson ""John you have jeopardized the integrity of English literature!"" at which stage he opens the false-front his Library of Classics to reveal a mini-bar from which he pours himself a whisky.
In fact, this is a good little comedy that slipped under the radar.  It's well worth a look and the audience won't be disappointed.  A rare one for the collection as well.",1485129600,,868,4.78

328407,5,6301264177,"Without question, this is one of the funniest comedies, parodies, and satires I have ever seen in my entire life. Decades after I saw it for the first time, I still quote lines from it regularly.

The premise of this movie is that the real genius of the Holmes-Watson duo was Watson himself, and that Sherlock Holmes was his fictional creation to cover his own brilliant sleuthing. Pressed to provide the public with a real ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Watson hired hard-drinking and dimwitted actor Reginald Kincaid to play the role, which he did. Along the way, Mr. Kincaid runs up gambling debts, womanizes, and generally acts like an idiot. Finally Watson has enough, kicks out his roommate, and launches ""The Crime Doctor."" Unfortunately, nobody wants the ""Crime Doctor"" to solve mysteries, particularly the British government, who need Sherlock Holmes to find out who stole the plates for the Five-Pound note from the Treasury. So Watson has to bring back his wastrel partner one more time for one more case -- only to find out that the enemy in the case is that ""homicidal maniac,"" Professor Moriarty.

The writing is crisp, the dialogue witty, and the jokes are brilliant. Michael Caine as Kincaid/Holmes and Ben Kingsley as Watson are in top form. Jeffrey Jones as Lestrade, Eric Porter as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lysette Anthony as Leslie, and Paul Freeman as Professor Moriarty, round out the cast.

I think my favorite scene in the whole picture is when Inspector Lestrade meets Leslie, and discovers that she is an ""actress on the French stage,"" in a revue called ""Les Fammes Faux.""

""An actress,"" says Lestrade. ""What a surprise.""

""The surprises are yet to come,"" says Leslie. Why Holmes/Kincaid and Watson walk off laughing is something I won't reveal.

I can't speak to the quality of the DVD, I'm afraid, so I urge buyers to beware and make sure they get a copy for the right region. But those who do will be rewarded with a particularly hilarious satire of the Holmes-Watson world and realize just how good the real Holmes stories were.",1462320000,,2054,4.854285714285714

better when Watson who is the real Holmes is killed and Caine has to solve the case only to find out Watson is still alive! There should have

There are enough reviews here that already comment on how good this movie is, so Ill skip that praise and get straight to the reasons for this downgrade.  (Okay, I cant resist at least one comment: The music by Henry Mancini is great.)

My biggest complaint about this movie is the poor transfer to Blu-ray.  The picture on my excellent 1080p TV is grainy and not nearly clear enough to recognize that I am playing a Blu-ray.  My TV plays DVDs at better resolution than I saw from this Blu-ray.  If the DVD were cheaper than the Blu-ray (right now it costs more) then I would recommend you buy the DVD instead.  Choose one or the other based upon cost when you order, because the Blu-ray doesnt seem to be any better than a regular DVD.  (Disclaimer:  I did not test the DVD version of this movie.)

The other, much less annoying, complaint is that this movie doesnt have subtitles of any kind.  I don't often need them, but sometimes when the background noise is high or the English is very accented I don't catch every word.  I try to pay attention to small details and will rewind and play a section again to get the dialog that I missed.  Subtitles help a lot but this movie doesnt have any.

My Blu-ray was in wide-screen format, as indicated on the box.

Once again, this is a great movie.  I bought the Blu-ray to upgrade from the VHS tape that I have owned for years.  Its the poor picture that I don't like.

328503,5,6301264177,"The new Blu-ray & DVD from Olive films presents this film in anamorphic 16x9. But does that really ad more picture from the old FULL FRAME MGM DVD? Unfortunately NO.

Without A Clue was filmed in the British 1.66:1 screen ratio.  That means the new 16x9 (1.85:1) presentation adds a little picture on the sides, but CROPS off a lot from the top & bottom.

The old Full Frame MGM DVD:
Plusses: 1) A small amount of picture is trimmed from the sides, nothing is missing. 2) The colors are brighter than the Olive release.
Minuses: 3) The image is grainier.

The new 16x9 Olive Films DVD & Blu-ray:
Minuses: 1) The top & bottom are cropped off significantly while a little more picture is added to the sides. 2) Colors are muted and the picture is darker.
Plusses:  3) The image is crisper with less film grain.

Do keep in mind that this is a British production NOT intended to be seen 16x9 (1.85:1), but rather the British 1.66:1 which is closer to the MGM Full Frame Version.  Olive Films incorrectly states on the back that this is 1.66:1 but that would require black bars on the sides.

In this case my preference is for the old 1.33:1 full frame MGM release, it is closer to the way it was intended to be seen in it's original British 1.66:1 release.",1435795200,4,1253,4.393939393939394

328505,4,6301264177,"Sherlock Holmes, to me, is the greatest sleuth of all time. The books written decades ago remain as entertaining today as they were when they were first published. The classic movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and his stalwart companion Dr. Watson are as enjoyable now as they were when first released. And the current versions of Holmes found in the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch or Johnny Lee Miller bring him to life in the present and will hold your interest as well. But what if Holmes wasn't really the detective weve always thought he was?

That is the premise behind the 1988 film WITHOUT A CLUE. The title refers not just to the mystery at hand but to the person of Holmes himself presented here. While Holmes (Michael Caine) solves the latest mystery to the praise of the press, once inside his apartment at 221 B Baker Street we discover that he is nothing more than an actor hired to play the part. In reality the detective is and always has been Dr. John Watson (Ben Kingsley), who hired actor Reginald Kincaid to portray Holmes giving a face to the detective. In an attempt to avoid the throng of fans he created a monster, an actor who has no clue how to solve a mystery and who is more interested in women and drink than crime.

Now that Watson is ready to face the public on his own terms he finds himself in a bit of a jam. Not only is no one willing to believe the truth that he is the real detective, his publisher tells him that it will ruin their magazine as well as any career he would hope to have. When the queen sends an emissary to recruit Holmes for an extreme case, he refuses Watsons aid and insists on Holmes to handle the case. Not an easy task since Watson just fired him and tossed him out. In no time at all he finds Holmes, brings him home and then begin to attempt to solve the case before them.

The case involves the disappearance of plates used to print 5 pound bank notes as well as the man responsible for the printing of those notes. Should counterfeit notes flood the streets of England it might collapse the countrys economy. Only a man like Holmes can help find the two and return things to right.

The bumbling faux detective and the real crime solver set out to save the country, never realizing at first that the man behind it all is the evil Prof. Moriarty that Watson has long known to be the leader of the criminal underworld in England for some time. Traveling from one end of the country to the other the duo do their best to find the clues needed to solve the case, enlisting the help of both the Baker Street irregulars and their landlady Mrs. Hudson (who both know the truth behind Holmes) to save the day.

The highlight of this film is the performances of both Caine and Kingsley in their respective roles. Caine portrays the unknown and less than able actor who seems more intent on a glass of whiskey than on saving the world. Kingsley turns in a great performance as a man frustrated by his own creation who now desires recognition yet receives none. That both of them can stand to be in the same room with one another as their goals go different directions yet force them to be next to one another makes for some hilarious moments. That there is a deep fondness between the two that neither is willing to admit makes it even better.

The mystery involved here makes the movie work as well, providing plenty of clues for the viewer to acknowledge and follow with the chance to solve the story before the end credits roll. The secondary performances add to the movie as well with not a one wasted or underplayed. The film production seen on screen is solid and the set designs and costuming, which could make a period piece like this fall apart, are handled with excellence.
Sherlock Holmes fans will love this film. Theyll enjoy not just the mystery but the hilarious concept of the film to begin with. While not based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyles books or stories it is an excellent addition to the history of Holmes to be placed right alongside such items as THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION and THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, two other great movies involving the character but not based on the original material. Some laughs, a mystery and enough action to hold your interests, this is a movie that should be in every Holmes fan collection as well as those of Caine and Kingsley.

328573,4,6301264177,"From 1982-1987 Stephanie Zimbalist starred as the assistant to private detective Remington Steele, whom she had invented because no client would trust a female detective. He got the credit, but she was the sleuth. TV writers Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther took that concept and applied it to the worlds most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. And TV veteran Thom Eberhardt made the leap with them to direct the 1988 PG-rated crime comedy-mystery Without a Clue.

Its a PG-rated light comedy that tries for slapstick at times and satire other times and often gets caught in-between. The result is a kind of tongue in cheek (or maybe bubble-pipe in mouth) parody that has a warm, tea cozy feel to it.

Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine make a good pair as Dr. Watson and the third-rate actor he hired to play the part of Sherlock Holmes so that he could be free to practice medicine and deduce all he wanted, without criticism or scrutiny. Of course, when you hire a bad actor it should come as no surprise that he turns out to be a ham who hogs the spotlight and has any number of habits that annoy the real detectiveincluding drinking too much and clumsy attempts at womanizing.

By films end, of course, theyll end up becoming a real team, but the fun comes from watching them get there. Without a Clue is a light mystery that features famed Holmes nemesis Professor Moriarty (Paul Freeman, who played Indiana Jones nemesis Ren Belloq) masterminding a plot to flood the market with counterfeit British money and cause the collapse of the British economy. The 5 printing plates have disappeared, and so has the printing supervisor. Scotland Yards Inspector Lestrade (Jeffrey Jones, who was the principal in Ferris Buellers Day Off) is jealous of Holmes and competes with him to solve the case, standing in the wings every time adoring reporters surround Holmes.

Theres a kidnapping and several skirmishes, all of which are handled with the same light touch as elsewhere in the film. Any potential trauma from the kidnapping, for example, is muted by a comic sequence that has Holmes pinned behind the door so that all we can see is his scrunched face as he threatens to pounce on the ruffians and urges a woman to keep a stiff upper lip. A few gunfights and an explosion are the only exceptions. Otherwise, moments of tension are defused by similar humorous devices, so that theres never much in the way of serious perilonly comic danger. Theres no language, and the only sexuality comes from the unmasking of a transvestite and a little keyhole peeping in which a woman is seen taking off stockings. Overall, its a pretty wholesome film that relies on some familiar, but softened elements from private detective mysteriesincluding a woman in distress (Lysette Anthony) and a housekeeper (Pat Keen) who sees more than anyone thinks.

Because Without a Clue isn't as nonstop funny and action-packed as more contemporary crime comedies, it will probably appeal mostly to families with older children who are able to appreciate the subtler humor and the character interaction between Holmes and Watson. My 17-year-old son enjoyed it a lot and pronounced it very funny.

Theres nothing here that the whole family cant see, really, but families with very young children might be better off watching Disneys The Great Mouse Detective (1986), which features mice sleuths and a similar kidnapping plot with the villain intent on taking over the British Empire. Then again, theres actually more overt peril and potential for trauma in that Disney animated film than there is in Without a Clue, which is really and truly played for laughs . . . or at least a broad smile.

Without a Clue looks terrific on Blu-ray, with a nice amount of detail even in numerous scenes when the lighting is dim. Some of the really dark scenes are murky, but overall its a solid transfer and with a solid soundtrack to match.

Paul Freeman (remember Belloq from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"") also turns-in a typical high-quality performance as Professor James Moriarty.

I rated this film at 5-stars because I can't think of a single draw-back to the film. At no stage did it become clumsy, slow, or take itself seriously. Holmes stayed the bumbling charlatan and Watson the true sleuth. I wish I could think of a single defining comedic moment or exchange between these two acting geniuses, but the film is packed with such scenes.

328845,5,6301264177,"as i believe i've already mentioned, there aren't many premises as flexible, as JUICY, as that of Sherlock Holmes. there's room for just about anyone who has a new approach, and the right ""new"" vantage point can sometimes get away with twisting it to positively heretical extremes. and even i have to admit that it don't get much more heretical than this.
the edgy but charming premise here casts DR. WATSON in the role of crime-solving wizard and SHERLOCK in that of slower-witted hanger-on. specifically, Dr. Watson worried about how is hobby would reflect on his professional standing, so he created a fictional cypher to take that credit...only for the ploy to backfire in his face. the stories became a sensation, the public became fascinated with this Sherlock Holmes, and Watson ends up having to hire an out-of-work, drunkard half-wit of an actor to keep up the appearance.
the inherent parody is two-fold. most obviously, it effectively skewers what was then the more usual perception of the characters, which over-simplified Watson into a hopeless buffoon. (by the way, i don't think they meant any disrespect to the good doctor by that, in fact they probably thought they were doing him a favor. Watson was a problematic character for moviemakers because in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books he doesn't do much more than take dictation most of the time. making him comic relief was one way of giving him a more active role the proceedings, giving whatever actor was playing him something to do. but i digress...)
on a more subtle level, however, the film is taking a potshot at Conan Doyle himself. Doyle was notoriously less enamored of his brainchild than the rest of the world, which manifiested itself most obviously in his futile attempt to lead Sherlock into a ""dirt nap"" at Reichenbach Falls. even if Doyle hadn't freely admitted every chance he got that Sherlock's indestructible presence at every turn he hook was making him crazy, it would be further reflected by a number of failures to maintain his own continuity. most (in)famously, how exactly was Watson wounded in Afghanistian? when our heroes first meet he is describes as having taken a jezail bullet to the shoulder...which seems to of migrated, because it was always described as in the leg from there on out.
so after an early spat, when ""Holmes"" walks out and Watson rejoices to be rid of the irritating nuissance, it's frankly hard not to interpret this as an attempt to break Sir Arthur's balls. (Watson even comes back from the sort of supposed death that Doyle had failed to condemn poor Sherlock to!)
better still, there's more to it than that. critics were mostly dismissive of the film, the genreal arguement being that the premise wasn't weighty enough for an hour and 47 minutes worth of film, that it should rather of been a skit on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE or something.
those critics are half right. the whimsical potential of the role reversal can be neatly fit into a couple of scenes. but the film never intended to stall there. you'd hardly seek, you almost certainly wouldn't GET, actors of the Caine and/or Kingsley calibre if all you intended was something that shallow.
the tricky part is to make sure everything else rings true. Sherlock Holmes might not be the person you'd been led to believe, but we're still taking a trip to Sherlock Holmes' world. we're still coming to Victorian London to foil the machinations of a criminal mastermind. (it's even still Moriarty!!) so the film was honor-bound to present us with a Sherlockian ""problem"" to be dealt with by Sherlockian means. and it does a pretty good job along those lines, presenting a disturbing plot to completely neutralize the economy of England via counterfeiting. granted, the professional nitpickers would argue that in so doing, the Professor is imperiling his own wealth as well, but why let such a persnickety minor detail spoil our fun?
most miraculously of all, however, is that the partnership is, as ever, ultimately faultlessly harmonious. it's bound to seem especially strong today, when the actors paired to our heroes identities - Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman - tend to take a distinctly Felix-&-Oscar approach to the relationship.
and that proves conclusively something i've long argued. certain pundits insist, re-insist, and re-re-insist that the ultimate success, artistically as well as commercially, of a given series is ultimately a matter of the writing, but i'm not so sure. the more i personally think about it, the more i personally am convinced that if there really is such a pivotal, make-or-break element, it's the characters. the viewer connects, or not, with the characters, so (unless it's an ""anthology"" series like THE TWILIGHT ZONE) they will ultimately tune back in, or not, based on their reaction to the characters. the civilian viewer, who makes his/her living as something other than a critic, is substantially more likely to forgive, say, MR. ED or THREE'S COMPANY for substandard writing because the characters are relatable and engaging than he is to regard the reputedly exquisite writing of, say, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT as somehow compensation for the fact that the characters are annoying or, worse, bland. everyone reaps the rewards of good writing, but the fact is, nobody TUNES IN for the writing. let's face it, the average viewer completely forgets that it even HAS to be written, that a script doesn't just crawl out of the Primordial Soup or something.",1345852800,2,5504,4.983695652173913

328877,4,6301264177,"Ben Kingsley, as Dr. John Watson, and Michael Caine, as Sherlock Holmes, do an outstanding job in turning amusing light fare into a small masterpiece. In this highly entertaining new iteration of the Holmes legend, Holmes is a creation of Watson rather than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Watson is the brains behind all of Holmes achievements. He not only writes the serialized tales of Holmes's adventures he actually solves the crimes.

Sherlock Holmes in this version is actually an unemployed actor named Reginald Kincaide whom Watson hired years ago to put a handsome face upon his fictitious detective.  As the movie opens Watson has reached the point of exasperation with Kincaide receiving accolades for the latest case ""solved"" by his dim-witted Holmes.  Watson attempts to jettison Kincaide's Holmes and reinvent himself as the ""Crime Doctor"". He finds to his dismay that the Holmes character is so embedded as a part of English culture that neither his publisher nor anyone else will accept him as a detective.

He re-obtains Kincaide's services in a fittingly humiliating manner.  They are retained by the British Treasury to recover the plates for the manufacture of the country's official 5 pound notes which have fallen into the hands of that iconic master of crime, Professor Moriarty.  That leads Kingsley and Caine on a wonderfully convoluted chase that is full of amusing chuckles as the hopeless Kincaide/Holmes tries to keep up with Watson's detective work while acting as though he is actually solving the case.  Parents can watch this film with their children as it plays on several different levels.

Caine is terrifically funny as Kingsley's foil.  Kingsley is wonderful as the exasperated Watson.  Neither actor overplays his part which would be very easy to do and would ruin the movie.

The greatest mystery remains why this movie is so overlooked? This is a comedy that has got all the right elements, took the beloved classics of mystery genre, looked at them from different angle and retold them in the most enjoyable way. Two of the great modern actors were perfect as beloved characters that were created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and became real for millions of fans. In the movie, though, we are presented with the situation that it was Dr. Watson who not only had documented his celebrated friend's most famous cases but who actually had the outstanding deduction, analytical, and observation skills and had solved the great mysteries of his time. Dr. Watson also had the writing talent and created his alter ago, the eccentric detective, Sherlock Holmes. The stories of Holmes' adventures had become wildly popular. Dr. Watson hired the local actor named Reginald Kincaid to impersonate the legendary detective. Kincaid (Michael Caine) certainly looked the part but by his own confession, he couldn't detect horse manure if he stepped in it! In addition to that, he was drunkard, womanizer, and a gambler. As played by Caine, he is absolutely hilarious and very charming. The best and funniest scenes belong to him. How he was trying to figure out the meaning of the evil Professor Moriarty's name is one of all time's funniest scenes. I've been fascinated by Caine's versatility for many years. If there is an actor who can play practically any role, be dramatic, moving, chillingly scary or comically brilliant and always convincing and joy to behold - it is Caine. Ben Kingsley (not a Sir at the time but Oscar Winner already) was also exceptionally good as easily irritated but brilliant, brave though greatly underrated Dr. Watson. As a huge admirer of two gentlemen from 221B Baker Street, London, I am happy to recommend the film to any fan. I believe that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would've enjoyed it. He had a wonderful sense of humor which shines through all Sherlock Holmes stories even the darkest ones and I believe he would've appreciated the idea of Holmes and Watson switching roles.",1242691200,3,2244,5.002673796791444

328969,5,6301264177,"Ben Kingsley is Dr. Watson, a man of science and logic who uses those skills to solve crimes and then writes stories about them. He's hired an actor, Reginald Kincaid (Michael Caine) to play his fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes.

But ""Holmes"" is getting on Watson's last nerve. He's getting cockier, not following instructions, and on the verge of blowing the whole scheme with his profligate ways. So Watson fires Kincaid and styles himself as ""the crime doctor,"" but the public wants Sherlock Holmes, and even Inspector Lestrade (Jeffrey Jones), who's suspicious of Holmes's techniques, won't listen to him.

It's particularly bad timing, as the financial fate of the country depends on the swift resolution of a case that the Queen herself asks Holmes to solve.

Then Watson disappears and Kincaid/Holmes is left to solve the case himself, with the help of Mrs. Hudson (Pat Keen) and Watson's Baker Street Irregulars (street urchins, in case you aren't familiar with the Sherlock Holmes stories).

This is a film in which everything just comes together so perfectly that it seems effortless. The comic timing is genius--in fact, Holmes & Mrs. Hudson on the stage is a classic piece of physical comedy with impeccable timing. Caine and Kingsley play off each other very well--neither upstaging the other--and there's more depth to the characters than just the surface frustrations with each other.

Caine's Holmes is a frustrated actor, drinking and womanizing because he knows he's nothing special. When he's called on to prove himself, it's lovely to watch his self-esteem grow. The same is true of Kingsley's Watson. He's a man of science, true, but he's tired of being in the shadows, and needs recognition and appreciation--like we all do.

I think that's why I enjoy Without a Clue so much--it has layers. There's the twist of the Sherlock Holmes story, which is fun, then there's the mystery/adventure plot itself, which is intriguing and exciting, and then there's the emotional story of the main characters, which is... er... emotional. In other words, it's satisfying on several levels, making it a movie I can watch more than once.

That said, I have to wonder why this inventive spoof of Sherlock Holmes was not a huge box-office success when it was first released.  Certainly it has garnered a cult following over the years, but the mass audience has never really embraced it.

Perhaps the reason is that Sherlock Holmes appeals to a more intellectual viewer and one needs, at the very least, a basic familiarity with Conan Doyle and the Baker Street sleuth in order to appreciate the humor (often slapstick) in this Thom Eberhardt-directed film.

The basic premise of the script, written by Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther, is brilliant.  In their scenario, there is no Sherlock Holmes.  He is a fictional character, created for Strand Magazine by genius detective Dr. Watson (Ben Kingsley).

The Holmes stories were so popular that people came to believe that Sherlock was a real person.  Thus, Watson hired an out-of-work actor (Michael Caine) to play the role of Holmes while he did the actual detective work.  Unfortunately, the actor is also a drunk, a gambler, a womanizer, a coward and an absolute moron.

As much as Watson would like to get rid of the imbecile, he's stuck with him...particularly when the evil Professor Moriarty (Paul Freeman) appears on the scene, planning the crime of the century.

This one is laugh-out-loud funny.

With a true widescreen presentation, the black bars are generated by the DVD player/TV with the full screen resolution dedicated to the movie image. When the Region 2 disc is viewed on a 16:9 TV, you will have to manually expand the image to fill the screen. That means that you are zooming in which essentially lowers the resolution.

Holmes: ""Are you sure he's not trying to kill me?""

Holmes: ""Thank God!""

What if Dr. Watson was actually the brains of this very famous partnership? And supposing that Sherlock Holmes was, in fact, a bungling ninny? C'mon, that premise'll draw you in, right? Here's the plot:

Dr. John Watson (Ben Kingsley), not wishing to undermine his career as a physician, once solved a case and attributed the solving of it to a fabricated character he named Sherlock Holmes. Very quickly, demand for this flawless Baker Street sleuth grew, and Watson was soon forced to hire a body to play the part. Enter Reginald Kincaid, a bungling, boozy, womanizing has-been of an actor. Yet, somehow, he fits the part.

But now Sherlock Holmes has taken all the plaudits and the credit away from Watson, who also soon tires of Kincaid's ineptness and habitual drunkenness. After one unsatisfactory incident too many, Watson cuts Kincaid loose and sets out on his own as the dismally self-titled Crime Doctor. But the Crime Doctor promptly finds himself dismissed by the constabulary and scorned by the latest prospective client. In the end, Watson has no recourse but to summon Holmes one last time (he finds him in a drinking establishment, pinching ladies' bums). But it's made perfectly clear, this is very definitely their last case together. And off they go.

It's a great premise, and WITHOUT A CLUE mines it for all its worth even as it upends the Sherlock Holmes mystique. The actual mystery itself which the duo attempts to solve is unimaginative (read: boring), involving the theft of printing plates from the Royal Mint. It's a good thing then that the film's focus is on the comedy. There are several hilarious moments here, laughs at times elicited by physical slapstick and at times by clever punchlines or even by a mere exasperated (Watson) or besotted (Holmes) expression. Ben Kingsley deserves massive props for conveying to mirthful effect some of the very best ""pained, put upon, and long suffering"" expressions I've seen in cinema.

The two leads, Caine and Kingsley, are splendiferous. If you're a Michael Caine fan, then you're not only aware of his wonderful acting skills, but also of his deft talent for comedy. My favorite Michael Caine film may actually be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Rotten-Scoundrels/dp/B00005PJ6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</a>. Here, he's even more broad in his style and delivery. It's understood that he's not directly playing Sherlock Holmes, but rather a ruined, drunken actor playing Sherlock Holmes. It's fun watching Michael Caine romp in his role of lecher and imbecile, basking in the glow of Holmes' admirers but being condescended to by those decidedly in the know (it's a sad state of affairs when even a street urchin thinks you're lower than dirt). Now, Ben Kingsley - who doesn't really do a lot of comedic films - he surprised me at how humorous he was, playing the brilliant criminologist just itching to be acknowledged but frustratingly trapped in his own created reality. He and Caine together are masterful. Perfect timing and very good chemistry, two very good British actors letting their hair down. Jeffrey Jones is also good as the always-one-step-behind Inspector Lestrade, and he's gold in the ""sleuthing"" distraction routine.

It's fortuitous that Caine and Kingsley are so good because Professor Moriarty doesn't really register much of an impact, although I did like his muttered line: ""How demeaning to be set upon by nitwits!"" But, if nitwits are consistently this funny, well, I guess I could do with a bit more of this brand of ineptitude. Concerning WITHOUT A CLUE, why not relish it for the farce that it is and tolerate it for the mystery that it isn't?

That said, this is an absolute joy.
I suspect the idea for the film came from watching Remington Steele, because the premise is about identical, but here it is perfected.  Ben Kingsley's performance as the put-upon and rigidly proper Watson is flawless.  Michael Caine has a great talent for playing the aloof genius, and also for playing the colossal moron.  He doubles the talent by switching from one extreme to the other in the blink of an eye.
And Paul Freeman perfects a sublimely sinister portrayal of Moriarty (no, not Arty Morty).  From just watching the film without looking up the name, who would have caught that this was the evil French anti-Indy from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""?

The only negative I might say about the movie is Jeffrey Jones' badly affected accent, but who cares? His performance as Lestrade is fun to watch with some sympathy - he's aware that Holmes is faking it but never quite able to nail it down with any proof, even to himself.

This film is a masterpiece of humor, of wit, of surprise, of funny and gay suspense, and I even mean strange, weird, frankly why not slightly queer. If your are learned you have a carriageful of allusions to anything and all of everything else you can think of. Oscar Wilde of course and his Lady Windermere's fan, Ben Jonson and his Silent Woman, and Shakespeare from the beginning of Titus Andronicus to the end of the Tempest, without speaking of King Lear and Hamlet who may sound banal, good enough for a couple of rooms in an inn.

Are we gay enough to laugh at our little feelings and desires for ever locked up in, is it, a cabinet, a cupboard, a sideboard or a wardrobe?

329022,3,6301264177,"I watched this film recently with a friend who is a Sherlock Holmes buff of longstanding.  I was curious as to how a true fan would take to the idea of Watson being the brains behind the operation and Holmes merely and empty cloak and deerstalker (i.e. an out-of-work actor hired by Watson to portray HIS fictitious creation, the genius detective Sherlock Holmes.  It seemed to be a clever enough conceit to me, but perhaps it would be akin to sacrilege for a true devotee.

I needed have worried.  My friend enjoyed the film immensely.  The notion of Sherlock being, in fact, a fraud and buffoon amused him to no end.  I, on the other hand, have never been that keen on Sherlock or mysteries in general, had a few more qualms about the film.  The premise is clever, of course--although even that seemed vaguely familiar, like maybe I'd seen a take off of the same order on some cartoon show or other--but was it more than a one-joke movie?  The actors seemed to be having a real lark of it, and that spirit can be congagious to some extent, but still, one can't help wonder if this ripe set-up couldn't have been exploited better.

But as an evening's entertainment, WITHOUT A CLUE is fine.  Fans of Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley will enjoy the film without reservation.  They are almost always interesting to watch, and this film is no exception.  Caine is especially good as the ne'er-do-well actor who begins ""to do BETTER"" at least when push comes to shove.  Kingsley nearly always radiates intelligence and wit, so who better to play Watson as the genius ""Crime Doctor"" that he secretly is?  They do manage to breathe considerable life into the film, as does the rest of the capable cast.  You just wish they had a little bit more to do is all.  It's all just a bit too--dare we say it?--elementary.",1184284800,5,1806,4.544891640866873
329023,5,6301264177,"If you asked me who my all time favorite actor was, my answer is Ben Kingsley, who won a Best Actor Oscar for Ghandi, and also impressed me with roles in ""Schindler's List"", ""Sneakers"", ""Joseph"", and ""Moses"".  Honorable mention would belong to Michael Caine, who garnered a Best Supporting Actor for ""Hannah And Her Sisters"", and who I also have seen in ""The Island"", ""Beyond The Poseidon Adventure"", ""Educating Rita"", ""Victory"", and ""The Muppet's Christmas Carol""; Caine was good in each of those roles, even though some of the movies weren't.

These two are not know for comedies (though Caine has been in his fair share).  However, both are absolutely hilarious in this comedy.  My dad (Neal Clark Reynolds, also an Amazon reviewer) said prior to seeing this that he had a hard time imagining Kingsley as Dr. Watson, partially because he had a hard time imagining anyone other than Nigel Bruce.  Both actors pulled off their roles.

The premise in itself is hilarious, a role reversal of classic fiction.  I wonder if Remington Steele was an inspiration, which also was based on a detective who was not taken seriously until a fictitious superior was created.

One concern I have over most movies nowadays is its attitude and worldliness.  There are PG-13 and R rated movies (e.g. ""The Second Chance"" or ""Schindler's List"") that I consider of a more positive worldview than a PG or even G rated movies (e.g. ""Wargames"" and ""Babe"").  This movie, while by no means Christian, did not have that negative attitude or worldliness.  There are only a couple of scenes that would make me nervous of having a child watching it, especially without parental supervision, but that's not bad nowadays, and those scenes were not bad enough to bump the rating to PG-13.  I will say, though, there is one plot twist I did not approve of, but not to the extent to keep me from enjoying the movie as a whole, and this would make me uncomfortable having a child below junior high watching it with me.

One theme I always enjoy is when a character has to step up to their potential, and does.  This movie fits into that category.  One important lesson in this film also is the role of gratitude.  That's all I'll say, and hope I didn't give away too much of the movie.",1183593600,4,2251,4.675126903553299
329024,4,6301264177,"What a joy to see two of the finest actors on the planet, Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine in a comedy! Academy Award winners,both,WITHOUT A CLUE is a great reminder of how real comedy done by classically trained actors can be so much more rewarding, especially Ben Kingsley who is more noted for his serious roles. Caine on the other hand has often played a lout and a buffoon before (SAVING GRACE)with great effect. Both show why they have such long and distinguised careers as they, with great agilility, bring Dr. Watson and Mr. Holmes to life in this funny and ficticious role reversal.

It is not necessary to have an indepth working knowledge of the Sherlock Holmes stories to appreciate this wonderful film, though knowledge of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories does make this screenplay all the more clever!

The great Henry Mancini provides a wonderful romp of a soundtrack fitting for this sparkling spoof on the team of Holmes and Watson.....or is it Watson and somewhat if none of Holmes at all???

Beautifully filmed on locations in and around London it is a real shame that WITHOUT A CLUE was released in a year when comedies such as BEETLEJUICE and A FISH CALLED WANDA as well as heavyweights DANGEROUS LIAISONS, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST and RAIN MAN were garnering all of the praise .Perhaps in a different year WITHOUT A CLUE , Kingsley and Caine would have received the recognition  so richly deserve!

Both vhs and dvd are adequate for WITHOUT A CLUE as they are both in FULL SCREEN and both have wonderful colour saturation.

Another suggested companion film spoofing the Holmes stories would be YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES.",1179532800,5,1643,4.787985865724382

329026,4,6301264177,"This 1988 Sherlock Holmes spoof boasts Michael Caine as Reginald Kincaid, an occasionally drunk, often womanizing actor (with gambling debts as well) who's recruited by Dr. John Watson (Ben Kingsley) to play the part of Holmes, whose stories Watson writes and sells to Strand Magazine. The premise is a clever one, and both Caine and Kingsley carry off their roles splendidly--as mayhap may be said in the UK--providing enough wit and even slapstick to generate a nifty flow of chortles as the movie progresses.

Even the notorious Professor Moriarty is included here and while the movie is decidedly lighter than air, it's immense fun to see a group of talented actors having fun themselves spoofing the most well known literary sleuth of all time. Dudley Moore's former partner Peter Cook shows up in a small role--another bit of fun--and Jeffrey Jones is perfect as the semi-dopey Inspector Lestrade.

Caine and Kingsley play extremely well off each other; the movie almost doesn't need anyone else. But of course a mystery plot demands other characters and so they are there including, of course, the aforementioned Moriarty (Paul Freeman) who supplies the dastardly plot point of ultimately bringing down the entire British economy. Caine is funny and, at times, absolutely hilarious.

Lots of fun and definitely recommended.",1176595200,5,1330,5.205607476635514
329027,5,6301264177,"My Russian born soulmate and I recently watched this movie (DVD) and I have to admit I was a bit nervous.  I discovered shortly after we started dating that the Russians have their own movie renditions of Sherlock Holmes and I must admit they are quite excellent.  I was a bit afraid  that she might find the whole idea of a comedy based on Holmes rather rediculous.  I was also a bit concerned for myself, as I'd never even HEARD of this movie before we picked it up at the store the other day, despite the fact that it came out in 1988.  But, given that it WAS a Holmes story and starred Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine, we figured ""how bad can it be?"".

Well, I'm happy to report that we both thoroughly enjoyed this movie, both as Holmes fans and as folks who enjoy a good comedy now and then.  I was a bit surprised just how much and how often my girlfriend laughed.  When we'd finished watching it, she said she not only liked it but considered it one of her favorites.  This coming from a woman who judges both movies in general and Holmes movies in particular with a rather discerning eye.

Others have explained the plot well enough here so I'll just that the production values, acting and directing of this movie make it great fun for lovers of Holmes and comedy alike.",1174003200,6,1278,4.331932773109243
329048,5,6301264177,"The reviewers who have said you don't have to be a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast who is familiar with the Holmes stories to enjoy this film are exactly right. I don't generally give in to hyperbole when reviewing a movie, so I won't go overboard with superlatives here, suffice to say that this is a charming, delightful and VERY funny satire! It really is. If you are reading this review and have never heard of this movie, or have heard of it but never got around to watching it because it didn't get rave reviews, don't let that deter you any longer! Buy or rent this movie and you will not be disappointed, I'm willing to bet.

The plotline and background of the film have already been reviewed here, so I won't repeat them. I will say that I first began watching this movie with luke warm hopes that I would enjoy it, but boy, did I enjoy it! The time flew by and I laughed almost all the way through it. Usually, movies with so many in-jokes, visual humor and tongue-in-cheek one-liners will have several jokes that fall flat, but very few, if any, do here.

The character of Mrs. Hudson has a prominent role in this film, and it turns out to be a blessing, as Pat Keen played the role to the hilt. Her comedic portrayal of the proper and sometimes haughty Mrs. Hudson of the books was hysterical! (Oops! Some unintended hyperbole there! Well, what the heck, she really was extremely funny and I was impressed at just how engaging Ms. Keen really is! I had never heard of her before this movie and I found myself searching online for roles she has had in other films.)

I give this five stars. Admittedly, I am a huge Holmes fan, but my girlfriend is not and when I loaned this movie to her, she returned it to me saying that she thought it was great. She even threw a couple of notable quotes at me from the film. I liken Without a Clue, in many ways, to the original version of The Out of Towners with Jack Lemmon, another film I reviewed last month. (NOT the new, inferior version with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn). Like Without a Clue, it is also relatively unknown by many people and is a very underrated comedy.

As for the packaging, I too, like others, am disappointed that this DVD is only available in full screen version and take off half a star on my rating for that. I would gladly have paid a few bucks more for some extras, possibly a commentary by Caine or Kingsley (or best of all, BOTH), or even a short interview or two. But since I am not able to give it 4 1/2 stars, I have given it five, as it is clearly worth more than four. Confusing? Peace.",1168819200,11,2570,4.303719008264463

The slick, subtle humour and clever reversal of roles in ""Without a Clue"", especially when combined with the incomparable talents of Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley at once sparring and collaborating in their characters' dilemma, cannot be matched, even by the original, genuine article of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation.

And what if, when pressured to produce Holmes to the public, Watson hires an out-of-work actor to pretend to be Holmes (Michael Caine). All the actor playing Holmes has to do is what Dr. Watson tells him to do as he, Watson, does all the real sleuthing. This is the clever premise of this film -- all the more clever if you know that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a doctor who wrote the Holmes detective mysteries on the side.

Of course, things start to spiral out of control when ""Holmes"" tries to solve the mysteries without Watson and ""Holmes"" makes up a lot of the famous mannerisms.

Lots of humor, a good mystery with quite a bit of suspense and the threat of real danger, plus very nice repartee between the two men as Watson becomes increasingly exasperated with his creation. (This has an almost ""Remington Steele"" like premise if any of you remember that 1980s TV show starring Pierce Brosnam.) This is a very under-rated film with a top notch cast.

329100,4,6301264177,"Without a Clue (1988) poses an interesting and humorous take on the Sherlock Holmes mythos created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The film asks what if the character of Sherlock Holmes was truly a fictional character created by Doctor Watson, and is played by an actor, with Watson being the actual mastermind behind solving the various cases and crimes?

In the film, Ben Kingsley plays Doctor Watson, the man behind the deductive and crime solving skills of his fictional character, Sherlock Holmes.  For reasons that are revealed within the movie, Watson was not able to take credit for solving his first caper, so he invented the character of Sherlock Holmes, but soon found his creation was in great demand, so he hired an actor, Reginald Kincaid (Michael Caine) to play the part of the detective while Watson stayed in the background continuing to be the 'brains' of the operation.  Only problem is Reginald Kincaid is a buffoonish, womanizing, gambling, drunkard, and unable to, as he put it, '...detect horse manure if he stepped in it.'  After a falling out, Doctor Watson fires Kincaid, and decides to go it alone as 'The Crime Doctor'.  Guess what?  The legend of Holmes has grown so large and become ensconced so deeply within the public psyche that no one takes Watson seriously, and even his publisher threatens to sue if Watson reveals the truth of the situation publicly.  Not only that, but a rather important case involving the financial integrity of the British Empire has surfaced, one involving the nefarious Professor Moriarty, and Holmes is the only man for the job.  Watson finds himself in the humbling position of bringing Kincaid back for what will be one last performance.

Kingsley and Caine play their parts perfectly, and are supported by a wonderful cast including Jeffery Jones as Inspector Lestrade, Paul Freeman as Moriarty, Lysette Anthony, and Peter Cook.  The dialogue is witty, and even though the plot a bit thin in some areas, the film works wonderfully as a farcical tale with just the right amounts of slapstick and tongue in cheek humor.  A completely professional job done by everyone all around.  My favorite part of the film was the notion of Watson using Holmes to keep Inspector Lastrade busy tracking down pointless leads while Watson performed the real detection at the crime scene.  I was laughing hard when Holmes was on all fours inspecting the pattern of a rug with the baffled inspector right next to him, trying to get the jump on the 'master' detective.

I was a little disappointed in the release of this film on DVD, as I thought the picture and sound quality could have been better.  Also, why is there only a full screen release available?  Special features are virtually non-existent with the inclusion of a trailer for the film.  MGM usually does a pretty good job with their releases, but they seemed to have dropped the ball here.  Anyway, this is a great little film, and worth watching if only to see two fine actors at work
