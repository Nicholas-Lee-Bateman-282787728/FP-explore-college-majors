8549031,4,B00AADAE4Y,"Mira Sorvino is wonderful as she plays a woman who for whatever reason (alcoholism)  has a life that has come undone.  She ends up from a distance, we are initially led to believe, in Union Square and knocks on the door of her sister, her complete opposite.  Sorivino, who plays a hard edged Bronx woman who smokes, non stop talks, worms her way into her sister's apartment and squeezes an invitation onto her couch for the next several nights meets her quiet, consertative (in manner, not politics) sister who works at home, who is polite, well mannered, and almost entirely silent during the entire first scene that Sorvino is there.

As the movie unwinds, we learn that Sorvino sees a bit of untruth in Blanchards character and accuses her of not being herself.  She is engaged to be married and has her fiances mother coming to help her find her Wedding dress.  It turns out that Blanchard did not know that her own mother died because she did not pick up when Sorvino called.

For a wonderful character study of two different sisters who have identical roots, do not miss Union Square!",1401926400,2,1090,4.645833333333333
8549032,1,B00AADAE4Y,"This is not worth watching, I wouldn't waste your time. I wish I could get mine back along with the 99 cents I spent! I rented this film based on the one review that gave it 5 stars. I hated it! The acting was subpar, the characters were not likable. I did not feel a connection to any of them. The two lead females whined throughout the entire film, so I was not sympathetic to either of their characters, but only annoyed and irritated by them both. I couldn't wait for it to be over and the only reason I watched the entire film was so that I could warn you before you get suckered in by the one 5 star rating like I did.",1367020800,3,624,4.0
8549033,5,B00AADAE4Y,absolutely loved it and thought it provided such a great family drama without being too dramatic or over the top.  One in which many can relate to regardless of how 'normal' or 'crazy' your family is,1354752000,3,199,4.527777777777778
