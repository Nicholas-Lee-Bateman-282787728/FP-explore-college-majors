While the plot is fairly standard and the budget is clearly low, Pop-Punk Zombies is still enjoyable because it was well-written and smartly-directed by a filmmaker who knew how to do a lot with the modest resources he had. The director, Steve Dayton, clearly has a passion for b-horror movies and knows the Zombie genre well enough to make an entertaining popcorn flick that avoids most cliches.

If you spent your childhood staying up past your bedtime to watch low-budget horror movies on cable, or ever took the time to browse through obscure VHS tapes in the 'Scary Movies' section of a local video rental store, this DVD belongs on your shelf.",1333324800,7,714,4.852459016393443

8484906,3,B005SGSNUU,"This was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. It is pretty much what you would expect from a very low-budget movie. I didn't go in to it with very high expectations and when I heard and saw the first few scenes I was almost ready to quit, but glad I didn't. It was somewhat engaging and they did develop a few of the characters. as Low-budget ""hey, let's go make a zombie movie"" flix go, this was better than most.",1441843200,,428,3.988372093023256

8484910,1,B005SGSNUU,"Right now any idiot with 12 friends and a camera is making a zombie film because they know idiots like me will watch them. That seems to be the underlying meaning of this film which does more to promote punk music than acting. The film consists of chained zombie punk rockers playing music getting loose and attempting to infect the dozen people or so who came to watch them. Eddy (Ian Kane) who wants to be a fashion designer, desires to get back with his girlfriend and save her from being eaten.

Extremely low budget. Not much in the way of plot or make-up. Dialogue sucked too. Keep the remote handy.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1378166400,3,648,4.483050847457627
8484911,1,B005SGSNUU,. Do not waste you time on this one. Gotta be one of the worst yet. You hope the zombies eat everyone.,1374624000,,102,3.6818181818181817
8484912,4,B005SGSNUU,"You know this is a low budget film, so if you want a re-polished George Romero Franchise film,look elsewhere.

Ed Wood made worse, the dude who did F.I.D.O. made  better. Nothing beats Shaun of the Dead.

There is a lot of humor in this effort. You can deconstruct the film to examine the moral corruption of America to make a buck, at any price-including human lives. There are all lot of  sub -human sociopaths, in the entertainment/business/banking world. Or ,if that is reading too much in,you can watch it for what is is..an amusing,fairly well done amateur  movie. In its defense,at least it wasn't filmed with a cellphone-disturbing trend.

Best watched for free on Amazon Prime free video.!:)",1367539200,2,700,4.889830508474576

8484915,1,B005SGSNUU,"Coming from someone who LOVES bad horror movies... this one is utter garbage.  The acting is god awful, the soundtrack is god awful, the makeup is... okay, I suppose.  Thankfully, I got free credits to watch this thing.  Don't waste your money unless you've seen everything else.",1335571200,3,279,4.8936170212765955
