8453899,4,B005052PQM,"Secret Service of the Imperial Court, aka Police Pool of Blood, was a pretty good movie. Top 60 for me, mostly because I love Leung car Yan (aka beard). Very good acting throughout. Leung plays a guard who is butting heads with a power-hungry Eunich, and when Leung Kar Yan's father's hand is forced to kill his son, all hell breaks loose. This is a swordplay movie with a bit of kung fu hand-to-hand combat thrown in as well. Some of the hand combat was very enjoyable. I'm not much of a swordplay guy, unless it's something like One-Armed Swordsman and such.

I own the Bonzai dvd, which is a beautiful print but was obviously stolen from another print, such as the Celestial print. I rate the dvd quality as a 4.5 out of 5 (with only Celestial dvds being of better quality).  There are no English dubs, which really infuriated me, and more or less informed me that the print was stolen from a better print. There are only English subtitles, yellow in color which annoyed me, and at times they misspelled words or grouped them together. It wasn't too bad, I just always love dubbing when it's available. 16:9 wide screened, 87 minutes.

The movie is a 3.5 out of 5, but with great quality and a great actor, I'll give it a 4.0 out of 5. Recommended, though a couple of Leung Kar Yan's films are better, such as The Victim and Legend of a Fighter.",1324598400,,1348,4.405622489959839
