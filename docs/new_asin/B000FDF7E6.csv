8120929,3,B000FDF7E6,"Heavy concentration on Tai Chi, not enough on balance.  Program compares poorly with free DVD from National Institute on Aging.",1388793600,2,127,5.35
8120930,2,B000FDF7E6,The sound was fine but the picture was very unclear. It seems like it's very old and a bad copy.,1388793600,,96,3.85
8120931,5,B000FDF7E6,"I can't speak highly enough about this DVD.  I would recommend it very highly to anyone who, like myself, is klutzy and always has been all the way to someone who has a pretty advanced stage of Parkinson's disease.  A close friend of mine does.  I bought a copy for him and he is benefitting from it already!  Yes the exercises SEEM too easy to really work when you first do them the first time but that's the amazing part of it.  It works and works well!  I had pulled muscles in both legs and getting out of my couch was a nightmare for fear of pulling them again  (even though it had been a long time since I pulled them).  Still within a WEEK of doing these exercises I was able to get off the couch without any problem!  A lot less expensive and of course no hassle as compared to physical therapists.",1329350400,10,806,4.181818181818182
8120932,3,B000FDF7E6,"These exercises are set up for the most frail.  They can be done with canes and/or walkers as well as seated.  Excellent instruction for those trying to regain basic strength and balance for walking and basic gait training.  Good suggestions for balanced routine daily movements.  They point out they are giving you a range of exercises to choose from.  To be most effective, you need to choose the ones you need and spend a longer time on them.  Good catalog of exercises.",1249257600,16,473,4.7073170731707314
8120933,4,B000FDF7E6,"Anything reasonably priced for senior citizens to keep moving and get any exercise is greatly needed.  This is a little ""different"" but still has it's merits.",1223596800,2,158,5.076923076923077
8120934,5,B000FDF7E6,"This DVD provides exercises to improve balance and coordination, increase leg strength and feeling in the legs.  There are two teachers, one sitting and one standing.  The exercises can be done either way, so that you can do them sitting at first, and then when you gain some skill and strengh, you can do them standing.  The exercises are presented clearly and are simple to perform.  This DVD will surely be helpful for seniors to live active lives or to return to active lives.",1147824000,41,480,4.678571428571429
