4987953,5,B006GWQZIC,this was another movie like american pie. I liked it enough to buy it. very funny in some parts. all they needed was a stiffler,1357948800,,127,4.12
4987954,2,B006GWQZIC,"This movie about 5 nerds who create a sex tape of a drugged out female celebrity
and then post it to the internet was pretty twisted. Kinda like a guilty pleasure
as it did have some entertaining parts but the storyline was way over the top.
I wasn't happy about the stereotypical depictions of women or men for that matter. Unless
you like humor of the lowest common denominator, avoid it. If you like sex humor
mixed with some twisted values and warped excuse for morality, try it, you might, I repeat
might like it.",1334620800,5,518,4.463157894736842

So,Some `BigBangTheory'-like guys are just having fun in college and stumble unto a party with a famous gal who doesn't realize she is being too friendly with strangers with a camera and libido.

Good cast of pretty starlets including Diana Terranova, Christine Nguyen and Kylie Nash.

This actually has a plot about guys doing what they must to make money to pay off blackmailers and actresses trying to get ahead in their careeres by any means necessary.

There is some very funny moments and a cohesiveness to plot.

From the makers of MILF film and builds upon some of those roles.

Amanda Ward has been in many Asylum movies and here give a sympathetic performance.",1328659200,2,703,4.965811965811966

8497903,2,B006GWQZIC,"Did anyone else notice the total  80's stereotype of ""nerd"" in this crapfest? Yeah, people who play video games and are good with technology and computers..... Only ""nerds"" could be like that. RPGs and sci-fi? Then you my friend have condemned yourself to nerd damnation. After all, who would play Skyrim or watch The Dark Knight?

I guess it's better to be galmourized for being mindless eye candy AKA whor---AHEM---""adult entertainers."" I'm also begining to think that the creators of these movies must have an in the closet gay persona. How many jokes about male ejaculation, jerking off and depictions of unbelievable erections can be made before it becomes tiresome?

The only thing good (and I use that term loosely) about this movie is the female nudity you will see which includes full frontal. However there is a reason why movies like this are no longer popular; the 21st century has something called the internet. If you like any of these girls you can find most of them online without all of this crap. More erotic and less annoying. People no longer have to run down to there local video rental store and check out a movie just to fast forward to the ""good parts."" Oh and there's also the fact that we are no longer 14.",1427500800,2,1232,4.668202764976958
8497904,4,B006GWQZIC,"Much better than 90% of the college sex-romps.  Very sexy without being borderline porn, and rather clever story line.  You do have to really suspend your disbelief......which is true with most films......Sharknado 2 anyone?  Spend the dough and give it a watch and you will look for time and place to re-enjoy......so rare in this genre.

Keep rockin' me baby!",1419984000,,361,4.966666666666667
8497905,4,B006GWQZIC,it is a funny movie a lot of silly ness but all and all a nice movie to enjoy has good high jinks like in the 80's and 90's teen comedys,1410048000,,136,3.4193548387096775
8497906,5,B006GWQZIC,"This movie started off kind of slow, but after the first sex tape is recorded, it gets better and better and becomes a real fun ride. The Asylum released this comedy, and they are awesome I think. This one isn't quite as good as the recently released Alpha House, but it is still a good time with plenty of nudity and sexual situations and some good laughs as well.",1409443200,,365,4.304347826086956
8497907,1,B006GWQZIC,"Don't buy this bootleg. The picture quality is so bad, you can hardly see a thing. Garbage...Just a terrible item.",1398384000,,114,4.75

8497909,1,B006GWQZIC,"It was messy, Not much of a good story line. They could have done a better job. Acting of some of the actors was lame.",1374278400,,118,3.76

8497911,2,B006GWQZIC,to much preview hype. The movie was as lame as the title. Rent it first if at all possible. Maybe it was just me.,1362441600,4,113,3.75
