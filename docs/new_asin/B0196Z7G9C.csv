7564800,5,B0196Z7G9C,"A great idea for a film, car nuts nirvana! Not sure what Everyday Driver can do top this film in 2016! A trip to Italy??? The Ring traffic was as scary as you hear about, maybe worse since the camera work here really showed how you have to anticipate the other drivers. Did not see much of the track etiquette you see on many track days. Spa is maybe the track in F1, so very cool that the team got to have a go there - those GT3's make driving fast look (too) easy. The off track scenes in the Cayenne were fun, great the camera guys were part of the movie. The extras included one of the presenters reviewing a Corolla, you could sense the contempt for the appliance on wheels!",1453507200,,679,4.151515151515151
7564801,5,B0196Z7G9C,"Todd and Paul, you guys are hands down my favorite car journalists on the internet. Love your weekly YouTube videos, extremely informative w/o all the childish BS that other journalists cling to. I listen to your podcasts on my way to work each morning. Loved mid-engines and mountains, currently watching this new blu-ray and I'm loving it so far. Keep up the good work and looking forward to all the new content coming soon.",1453334400,,426,4.77027027027027
7564802,5,B0196Z7G9C,"Not much to say other than you won't be disappointed with this one. Sit back, relax, drink an ipa and follow along on an adventure that all of us want to take...Yet few will ever get the opportunity to. It was almost like I was crammed in the back seat between Tom and Edgar!",1451865600,,275,4.111111111111111

7564804,5,B0196Z7G9C,"I received this film as a Christmas present from my mother (I wonder how she knew haha). I thoroughly enjoyed the flick from start to finish, and I think it's a must watch for any car guy who is considering a trip to to the famed Nurburgring. I especially enjoyed the last section at Spa, my personal dream track. I hope to make the same trip you guys did one day! Cheers!",1451433600,,372,4.180555555555555
7564805,4,B0196Z7G9C,Really motivated me to put a visit to Nurburgring on the bucket list and how to do it right.  The film does not sanitize the challenges of this track.  You need a healthy respect for the track and I was amazed how crowded it gets.  The full track instructor extra one the blue ray is great and a great enhancement.  The footage at Spa Francorchamps with Pistonclub is well done.  I,1451174400,,381,4.309859154929577
7564806,4,B0196Z7G9C,"I enjoyed this video. I am a casual car enthusiast who has watched most of their videos on youtube and love their cinematic portrayals  and well written car reviews. I also enjoy their banter and the way they produce their fast moving reactions back and forth between Paul and Todd. This blue-ray video was the first feature length film I have seen from Everyday Driver and I will eventually see their 911 and mid engines videos as well.

***Keep in mind that this Blue-Ray video would not play on our Xbox which has a blue-ray app. We were getting an error ""having trouble reading this disk... 0x91d70000""!  However it did run fine on a PS3.

Here are my reactions specifically to this film. The first third focused on Nurburgring (and getting there on the autobahn). This part of the film appeared a bit limited as far as camera angles and feedback of the cars they were driving. I imagine they were handicapped by limited access as they obviously can't do the kind of retakes and setups they might ordinarily use in the canyon carving of their typical videos.  Some scenes in the first third were a bit slow for this casual driving fan. I am Curious why they were not properly mic'd when they were standing in front of a famous Nurburgring curve and talking about it?

The middle section focused on a company that customizes Porche cars. I was not really into that as this is so far over my head (I drive a new Performance Pack GTI) that I have a hard time relating (a far cry from reviewing Fiesta STIs, Hellcats, etc in their typical videos).

The last section was on their time at SPA and this part of the film came alive for me. Why?  Well I think they were able to capture this portion of the film with more of their dramatic flare that appears in many of their youtube shorts. They had the music, the banter, the car and the challenge of a wet track. The cameras were able to capture this track in a way to made it come alive. I did not know anything about SPA and now know that I would be afraid to drive it with the type of serious drivers on that track. However, I enjoyed watching Todd and Paul take on the challenge and do a great job keeping up with all the GT3s (and even passing a few cars!).

Overall, a great xmas gift!",1451001600,,2238,4.347721822541966

7564808,5,B0196Z7G9C,"I just watched this over on Vimeo. Wow! Such a fantastic film that includes everything that you think about doing 'if you ever make it to Germany'. I wasn't sold on the idea of Germany as a pilgrimage, but after watching this high quality video, I'm sold. Can't wait to get my Blu-Ray in the mail to check out all of the extras. Excellent job by Everyday Driver!",1449705600,,362,4.338235294117647

8744214,5,B0196Z7G9C,"The Everyday Driver team of Todd & Paul is fantastic and they put together great videos, whether it's the feature films, fast blasts, or TV shows. Pilgrimage gives great insight into two of the most famous tracks in Europe, and it's very enjoyable to see their experience.",1527206400,,272,4.808510638297872
8744215,5,B0196Z7G9C,I've always wanted to drive the Nurb.  Next best thing to going myself is watching these wonderful people go.  Excellent quality and production.,1494892800,,144,5.217391304347826

8744220,5,B0196Z7G9C,"Great Movie with some interesting extras thrown in!  Definitely adds a stop or two if I were to ever go on a trip to Germany.  Its cool to learn there are places you can go to rent decent cars with instruction and go around the Ring.  It also gave some interesting insight into Supertuners in Germany which I wasn't expecting.  Definitely recommend to any car enthusiast.  Their trip to SPA had them driving more interesting cars on track and seemed like the most exciting part of the film.

Definitely check out the EverydayDriver YouTube Channel and Podcasts if you haven't yet these guys are genuinely entertaining.",1458604800,,618,4.783018867924528
8744221,5,B0196Z7G9C,"This is a very enjoyable, very well done film.  I would love to take this exact same trip with some of my car guy friends and throughout the film I couldn't help but feel like I was the one on the trip and I was sharing these experiences and discussions with some of my friends. The camera work was excellent and conveyed a real sense of speed. I recently took a high performance driving class and as I watched Paul and Todd go around the 'ring and listened to their driving coaches, I couldn't help but nod in understanding. I only wish we could've seen some laps around Spa in something more exotic, like a GT3. Other than that, two thumbs up!",1458432000,,645,4.286885245901639
8744222,5,B0196Z7G9C,"Awesome movie! Makes me want to do it as well, but I think I need a lot more driver training before I attempt that. They have inspired me to contact a local track for driver training classes!

I can't  wait to see the other films these guys make and the watch Pilgrimage AGAIN!

Also, these guys do a great podcast weekly, as well as great YouTube videos! Check them out at [...]",1457308800,,379,4.236111111111111
