8555101,4,B00AO1RKVW,Funny and quirky British comedy sit com. Premise is kept up throughout the entire series that everything that can go wrong with the main character does.,1492560000,,152,4.884615384615385
8555102,5,B00AO1RKVW,"This is one of the funniest, strange and crazy program the Brits have ever conceived.  I just don't know how to explain the show but my husband and I truly enjoyed this show.",1481068800,,174,4.2727272727272725
8555103,4,B00AO1RKVW,"This is a great series though I have no idea how anyone could come up with this premise it is built upon. To the benefit of the shows, all the players handle their roles extremely well, right the way down to the minor roles. I would advise no more than two episodes at a time as it is possible to overdose - growing up, we watched it weekly - but if you want to while away the long, dark evenings, this is a good way to do it. Now, the question of animal abuse... there is none at all, Maybe some things are implied but you would need really quite an imagination to see anything there. I am glad we did not let that put us off. A first class sit-com.",1474588800,,650,3.969465648854962

8555107,4,B00AO1RKVW,Frankly the premise is wonderful and situations hilarious.  Makes you wish someone would update this series.  Could be British or American.  I almost didn't recognize Callow as the larger than life Scot in Four Weddings.  What else of his have I missed?,1375056000,3,253,4.9523809523809526
8555108,4,B00AO1RKVW,This really made us laugh but we finally gave up because of the constant use of the abuse of animals which is surprising for the Brits.,1366416000,3,135,4.230769230769231
8555109,5,B00AO1RKVW,"Amazing plot writing of multiple humorous thread-coincidences that culminates in one final hilarious finale. Extreme absurdity is part of the comic fun. Fantastic writing offsets the mid-80s aspects, so watch it as 80s period comedy and enjoy. So over-the-top ridiculous it causes belly-laugh aches. If your humor capacity is not currently warped, this show will do it. Warped in a fun way. 16 episodes were the beginning of writing careers of Andrew Norriss & Richard Fegen. Wife & I laughed hard, we'll watch it again.

Tom Chance (Simon Callow) speaks in fragment sentences while being in the wrong place, bad time. Speaks like a Dickens's character and/or like a 21st century texter. Alison Little (Brenda Blethyn- `Vera') is a stone lighter with an innocence of voice like Downton Abbey's Daisy, and voice and charm of Upstairs, Downstairs' Sarah. The show is loaded with guest stars, many in their pre-stardom days.
