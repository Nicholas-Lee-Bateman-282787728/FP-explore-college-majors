6361951,4,B00JJRLFTU,"Enjoyed this series 2 as much as the first.  So revealing of the young Morse.
Gives you insight on Morse when you watch, re-watch the series with John Thaw.
Much more insight on the character .",1405123200,2,193,4.361111111111111
6361952,5,B00JJRLFTU,"If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 - who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years - you probably know that the show has been revived in the form of a prequel. The first season was outstanding, and now the second is maintaining the outstanding same unrelenting excellent quality, which isn't easy to do.

John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the inspector's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?

But now we have the new younger Morse played by Shaun Evans in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. According to the Morse mystery novels, Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. The real story is that the author, Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.

Is this new endeavor in its second season worthy of the old series? Definitely yes. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is in evidence. The production values are superior to the old series, although the same wonderful iconic music remains. The sets for example - the police station, Morse's new rental, museums, boarding school, pubs - are full of period detail from the time period in England in the 1960's so Anglophiles will be delighted. The cinematography is original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera, perspectives or looking through a dirty car window as Morse steps out of a building. You feel the texture of England. I watch it as much for the scenery as for the plots and actors.

The actors are stand-outs: Endeavor's boss Thursday (Roger Allam) and the chief of police (Anton Lesser), the other police colleagues, and Morse's new possible love interest are splendid. Fun to watch Morse and Thursday's relationship develop. Since Morse doesn't have Lewis as a sidekick yet, Thursday fills in as the person to which he is closest and their relationship gives the series warmth. It is an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor - you can see a bit of her father's face in hers.

The crimes are appropriately complex with original plots. So, even though we still miss Mr. Thaw, the actor Shaun Evans is maturing comfortably into the role of Morse. We hope the series will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series. If the quality continues, it certainly has the potential to last a long time for Inspector Morse's old and new delighted devotees.",1405036800,3,3412,4.795918367346939
6361953,5,B00JJRLFTU,"Currently watching this on PBS and really enjoying it - hope there are more in this series to come.  Loved Inspector Morse, have the complete set - happy they have gone and made series about him in his younger days as a young detective so we could get a better understanding of him and how he turned into older Morse.

***7/21/14***

Just watched last episode of Series 2, surprise ending - it's a cliff hanger. Will DI Tuesday live or die? Who will clear Morse of murder charges? Can't wait for Series 3 to find out.",1404777600,4,517,4.364583333333333

Also - I have added a ""preview"" video provided by PBS.

If you've read my other reviews on Amazon you will know that I'm a huge fan of British (or Irish or Scottish) crime and mystery series produced by the BBC or ITV , which air on US TV on either BBC America or PBS.  I really prefer the home video versions because nearly every one of this shows has been edited (for either language or extreme violence - often both - and maybe even brief nudity). I prefer the original.  I was really looking forward to this second ""series"" (they use ""series"", not ""season"", when there are only a few episodes, of this prequel to the long running ""Inspector Morse"" series of shows. But then a few things occurred as I watched it, and I honestly can't give it the five stars that many others probably will. Remember, I am reviewing the Bluray version - not the TV one - from a screener provided by PBS Home Video for review.

I'm also a big proponent of not providing episode plot summaries (as some do) because IMHO it spoils the enjoyment. And I most certainly don't like ""spoilers"", so you rarely - if ever - will find one in my reviews. After all, these are called ""mysteries"" for a reason.

Since this is the second in the ""series"", I will make the assumption that those reading this review will have seen Series One and know the main characters - DI Morse and DCI Thursday - and that the crime/mystery series takes place in Oxford, England in the late 1960s (and reflects the political climate then).  There are four ""episodes"" - each lasting exactly 90 minutes (give or take a few seconds). Since PBS always includes ""promo ads"" at end of their broadcasts (this show is now - as I write this - being aired as part of Masterpiece Mystery - followed by the comedy ""Vicious"" to fill a two hour block) so I know that some scenes were edited for US TV. There is no nudity and I don't remember and expletives so it is probably some violent scenes that were cut. The BD version is the full UK version.  The show aired in the UK on the commercial ITV networks, not the BBC.

As I watched the first three episodes I was drawn into the mysteries and was enjoying the acting. The writer does not give the viewer ALL the clues needed to solve the crime until near the end, so you - along with the detectives, are still kept ""in the dark"", so to speak. And while each crime is solved, there are still aspects of the ""personal lives"" of the core cast members which continue to grow. Then came the fourth episode and I felt ""cheated"" - so to speak. But more on that in a moment.

The BD has no ""special features"" - not even a short ""behind the scene"" one that most home videos have.  It does have an option for English subtitles though and these were unlike any I've seen on a DVD or BD before. The accents of some of the characters - and the speed of their voices - on this series made me want to use the subtitles so I could ""see"" words that were not familiar to me. I'm happy to say that the subtitles are in bright yellow (unlike the white that some shows use) which makes them stand out. But these subtitles move! Yes, move! First it will be in the bottom left of the screen and the next one is in the bottom right and, sometimes, it will be in the bottom middle. Since the show is presented wide-screen, it means that you eyes must move to find the words before they disappear.  I'm not sure who at PBS decided to present them this way but I hope they never do it again. This frustration removed most of a star from my rating.

And now for the ""semi-spoiler"": (Feel free to skip to my signature if you wish but I feel obligated to share this info.)

As I watched episode four I made a note that this was the best of the four on this disc.  As I said, earlier, each crime is completely solved (often in the final minutes) in each episode. I expected that in the fourth one.  But, not only is the crime never completely solved at the end but THREE events (which I will NOT disclose) happen in the last 60 seconds which left me frustrated (and frankly, annoyed). Yes, some series have ""cliffhangers; this show has two and - knowing that it will be another year until Series 3, I was left unfulfilled. If I  had watched only the first three episodes, I would have felt that, the series could continue and new events would occur, but I wouldn't HAVE TO wait for another season. Yes, ""Sherlock"", another PBS mystery series uses a cliff hanger, but the mystery in that episode is solved. So, I'll leave it up to you to decide for yourself. If you can live with spending six hours watching a series and then have to wait a year to have MAJOR plot points resolved, then - by all means - you will love this BD. It's all subjective but I sure wish they at least solved at least two of the ""unresolved"" story lines. In the end, I felt ""let down"" by the writer and director.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6361955,5,B00JJRLFTU,"My evaluation is for the first series.  I had no reasonable concept of how the younger Morse would play, but was surprised at that he is so deeply reflective and withdrawn.  It was interesting to learn how Morse developed his desire for classical music and the initial emotional trauma it brought him.  Morse earned his reputation early by being a 'good detective, but  inoculated with high energy, unrealistic explosions and obligatory steamy sex of American mysteries.  I have the second season disks on order and am anxiously awaiting their delivery.",1402963200,18,553,5.1
6361956,5,B00JJRLFTU,"The second series of Endeavour will begin on Masterpiece in a few weeks.  Do not miss it.  Better still: buy an all-regions dvd player so that you can get these kinds of shows in advance from amazon.co.uk.  You can also comparison shop, because the prices vary between the U.S. and the UK.

Season 2 consists of four episodes, each approximately 90 minutes in length.  Russell Lewis, the author of the season one episodes remains at the helm and he is at the top of his game.

The production values are spectacular.  The period details--material culture items, the color palette, signage, clothing--are absolutely perfect.  You never sense that the characters are wearing costumes.  The plotting is a bit more complex than in season one.  They are more reminiscent of Morse plots, with long explanations coming at the end.  This is not a failing, just a change.  The acting is heart-breakingly good.  I was surprised to see (in an interview) that Shaun Evans actually has a natural Irish accent, which is completely suppressed when he plays Morse.  He and Roger Allam carry the show with beautiful chemistry but the supporting actors are all rock-solid, particularly Anton Lesser as Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright.

In season two we learn some of Fred Thursday's backstory and we see Morse enter into a romantic relationship.  While the stories are not interlocked and rigidly sequential we are promised retribution by one of the villains in the first episode.  Thus, there is a cloud over both Morse and Thursday throughout the season, as we wait for the second shoe to land.  Episode four ends the season with a series of cliffhangers, thus promising us, one hopes (along with the big UK numbers), a third season.

On a five point scale I would give one of the episodes four and a half stars, two of the episodes five stars and the season ending episode six stars.  It's just that good--comparable, e.g., to the Foyle's War series eight final episode, ""Sunflower.""

Bottom line: if you loved series one you'll love series two.  This remains one of the top British mysteries and, yes, Colin Dexter continues to appear in each episode.

Very highly recommended.",1402272000,166,2167,4.909090909090909

6361967,5,B00JJRLFTU,"I am definitely a devotee of the British television series, ""Morse"" starring John Thaw.  I've read all the books in the series by Colin Dexter and have the series on DVD.  When ""Endeavor"" came on television's Masterpiece Theater, I started watching because it is the story of D.I. Morse as a young man starting out in police work.  Morse's first name was never revealed until the last episode of the series, and of course it was Endeavor. Not only does the name fit Morse's personality, but it has that sound of ""and ever Morse.""

The series of the young Morse is very much in keeping with the personality and quirks of the older man;. the classical music, opera, a bit of a surly response here and there and just not giving up on a case.  It always amazes me how the British crime shows' police get their perpetrators with no gun fights or tense minutes of a shootout.

There are four episodes included in this set: Trove (in which a jittery-jumpy Morse gets mistaken for someone else and beaten up), Nocturne (where the past and the present merge as someone haunts an old house, currently a creepy school for girls), Sway (Married women are being killed, their wedding rings stolen; Morse learns that infinity is really only 8 on its side), and Neverland (more police corruption).  Of the four Nocturne was my favorite, Neverland my least favorite and the reason Ive decided to quit watching this series (if they ever decide to cough up series 3 now that series 4 is filming).  Ive never been fond of that old chestnut: the framed cop.

6362052,2,B00JJRLFTU,"I think this dreary, cheap looking series in the worst of the current crime series from the UK. The two episodes I watched were so absurd, and the interminable explanations at the end so garbled and ridiculous, I doubt if I'll watch the others.

6362057,5,B00JJRLFTU,"I really enjoyed the finding the scenes edited out to fit the PBS schedule. As watchers of the entire Morse series, I think the scene is interesting where Endevour, after he had been shot in the leg, is told by the doctor he would have a limp in middle age. Both of us had noticed that John Shaw of his way of ""being Morse"" limped at times. Had that been left in, it would have tied the two series together even more.

Shaun Evans and Roger Allam are particular standouts, who's character's fierce innate intelligence interact with both a tension and ease that crackles on the screen.  One of the best series I've seen in years. Don't bother to over-think others reviews or choose to compare it to anything else.  Just watch and enjoy!  I chose to approach this whole ""Enderavour"" Pilot/Series in that spirit, and what a sweet ride it has been!

At times it is a distinct disadvantage not to have a 7 year old available to compensate for our electronic ignorance. However, we were able to follow the stories, even though we could not always understand every word the characters uttered.

The acting, the production, the plot and dialog are all very high quality. But let the buyer beware; this disk ends with a big effective ""To be continued""  I'm sorry, if you don't have an ending, you don't have a story.  Nothing is resolved, and it's not like you can just order series 3 on Amazon.  Perhaps this was a means to increase public demand for the show's continuance. It doesn't matter.  Who would knowingly watch a movie with the ending missing?  And while I'm being uncharitable to an otherwise excellent BBC production, there is another irksome aspect of this series. Morse's final solution to the crime is so abstract and indirect as to be preposterous.  Unlike a good Agatha Christie story where the final scene puts the pieces together, Morse's final solution is so wild the viewer could have never deduced it for himself.  I gather this is a hallmark of this series, like Mission Impossible's people wearing masks of other people.  It's detractive because it's just not reality. Anyway, I would recommend waiting until Season 3 is out before investing in this.  Other than what I've mentioned, it's a really nice series.",1422748800,2,1339,4.8034934497816595

6362380,3,B00JJRLFTU,"Series 2 continues to follow young Endeavour Morse in his early day as an Oxford police constable working with CID.

I have two problems with the way this series is developing. One is that the storylines are so convoluted, with some of the connections barely discernible, even after repeated viewing that I sometimes wondered if I should be taking notes as the episode played out.

Secondly, Morse never seems to learn from his mistakes. We all know he's smarter than all of the other cops but he's becoming rather obnoxious. Shouting at this or that and demanding that his vision of the case or cases is the only truly probable interpretation. Then he goes blustering along until at some point he figures out he has gotten it wrong...again.

Several of Morse's fellow officers try to make excuses for his disrespectful and brash behavior, DI Thursday suggesting he's just had one too many conks on the head and is suffering from a touch of concussion. ""Yes, that's probably it,"" Chief Superintendent Bright muses, ""A touch of concussion.""

Concussion my arse, as they say. Be it the fault of the writers, directors, or whomever, Endeavour the character and the series are losing their charm. The longer I watch the Endeavour episodes, the more I want to re-watch the ""Inspector Morse"" episodes starring John Thaw.

It's been reported that there is no Series 3 yet scheduled to be filmed. Rumors suggest that the actor Shaun Evans is seeking different acting challenges apart from Endeavour. It has also been reported that Colin Dexter didn't want the Endeavour series to encroach upon John Thaw's ""Inspector Morse"" time frame.

Cliff-hangers notwithstanding, I think it's time to call this series completed.",1410393600,,1708,4.996478873239437

6362400,4,B00JJRLFTU,"Again they have hit a home run with the early life of Morse.  I do have one criticism about this set of shows.  There is one story that is too realistic in the telling of the story for my taste and having watched it once I will never watch it again.  I will say in its behalf that it is important to one of the characters who is on going in the story and it explains why he is the way he is.  However, I still think it did not have to be so realistic in the telling,  It almost seems like the producers think that to have an American audience like the show we want to see detailed perversion, which is not true of most people who love Morse.  We enjoy stories told that we have to use our minds to figure out, not to watch shows that make you never want to watch them again and almost get up and leave in the middle.",1409961600,,816,3.8855421686746987

While plot situations on the show can become confusing at times, all is eventually clearly explained & understood. As in the original Morse series, Inspector Lewis, & season one of this series, quality reigns supreme. The atmosphere, settings, acting, & storylines are always top-notch.  The final 20 minutes of the final episode were spectacular, but it is frustrating that such incredible cliffhangers will have viewers waiting a year to get them resolved(I'm assuming this show will be renewed). Cliffhangers can be somewhat tolerated on US television, where the next season comes in 3-4 months.  All in all, can't wait(but I have to!) for the next episodes. A nice addition is the lovely Shvorne Marks  cast as Endeavour's girlfriend. She adds a nice sweetnees & likabiity to the sometimes intense proceedings on the show.",1408838400,4,897,5.215277777777778

6362466,5,B00JJRLFTU,"Endeavour is a series of murder mysteries which form a prequel to the well known Morse series. This is the second series of Endeavour. It consists of four 90 minute episodes. Each episode has excellent production values with obsessive attention paid to period detail. The series is set in 1966. The format will be familiar to anyone who has watched Morse, Lewis, or any Miss Marple show. There is a murder at the start, maybe one or two in the middle and a reveal of the culprit just a few minutes at the end. This sounds trite but it is a well established format that keeps your attention, allows you to guess the actual villain incorrectly a couple of times and to be surprised at the end. Endeavour does this incredibly well.
I really won't share the plots of the four episodes since that would totally ruin the series for you. Unlike the first series these episodes are interlinked. Where the plots suggest a conspiracy linked to the masons and local VIPS. They have an eerie echo of recent scandals within the British establishment too.
The second episode is a little different in both style and content and, if you have enough imagination, is a very effective horror story; I felt like hiding behind the sofa.
This is the second series and since it ends on a real cliffhangar I hope that a third series will be forthcoming.",1408147200,6,1329,4.588235294117647

But, what to do when they were over? Happily they gave us many years of Inspector Lewis to let us continue the superb mysteries we had been enjoying for all those years. And understandably disappointed when they ended, they filled our hearts again with a prequel program of how Inspector Morse became Inspector Morse. What could be any better than that? More, of course! I enjoyed the second season as much as I have enjoyed all the previous programs. And it just keeps getting better! Thank you!

Because I loved the original Morse series and the Lewis series, I enjoy how seamlessly references to the other two series are woven in. For example, in the first episode of this second series, there were references to the Masons and to the Wolvercote buckle from Morse and to the sports car driver Griffon from Lewis.

6362538,3,B00JJRLFTU,"""Endeavour"" Series 2 declines in the quality of its plots and neglects its characters amid the over-written and badly-written narratives. The first episode has Morse returning to duty with a bit of PSTD after his injuries of last season. That passes quickly. The only consistent thread is disappearing items from the police evidence room, which are the basis for an ongoing mystery and suspected police corruption through the four 90-minute episodes. We begin with four cases that turn out to be connected -and distasteful and outlandish in the end. And we end the series with a cliffhanger episode revolving around innumerable coincidences and the requisite implausible conspiracy of sexual deviance that seems to always populate British television dramas these days. None of it makes any sense. The two episodes in the middle are only slightly better.

""Endeavour"" never had strong plots. The series was fueled by Roger Allam's strong presence as DI Fred Thursday and the conflict between Morse and more ordinary members of the police force, namely CS Bright (Anton Lesser) and DS Jakes (Jack Laskey). These elements are absent in Series 2. The episodes are so full of plot that Morse and Thursday hardly get a word in. They don't ever have a conversation. Their characters have no opportunity to come across. What happened to solving one mystery? Why do we have multiple cases and dark little secrets, all connected in ways that insult the viewer's intelligence, in every episode? I guess the question is really whatever happened to writing? There's none here. Shaun Evans hits one note and sticks with it. He doesn't act. His character was always an anachronism -and a completely different character from the Morse of ""Inspector Morse""- but the anachronistic behavior goes further this series. The episodes are:

After several months spent recuperating from his injuries, Morse is back at work with DI Thursday and DS Jakes in ""Trove"". That very day, beauty queen Diana Day (Jessica Ellerby) is attacked with fake blood in a starter pistol as she waves to the crowd from a parade float. And a man comes into the station to ask for help in locating his step-daughter Frida Yelland (Tieva Lovelle) who went missing months before. Morse promises to look into it, when he is called to the scene of an apparent suicide. An unidentified man has fallen to his death from an Oxford rooftop right on top of a parked car, while it was being ticketed. Puzzled by the fact that a notebook the mystery man had with him when he died has disappeared from the police evidence room, Morse and Thursday are then called to investigate a robbery of some antiquities at Beaufort College. On account of some words written by the deceased on a piece of paper, Morse is beginning to believe some of these cases are related.

Mr. Adrian Weiss, a 69-year-old herald who researched family histories, is stabbed to death in a museum in ""Nocturne"". Other visitors at the time were an elderly American couple on holiday and 8 summer boarders from the Blythe Mount School for Girls. Morse goes to the school to interview the girls and finds them alternately jittery, defensive, flirtatious, and, in the case of 13-year-old Bunty Glossop (Nell Tiger Free), observant. The Blythe Mount School occupies the old estate of Mr. Blaize Hamilton where, exactly a century ago, 3 of the Hamilton children and 2 of their domestic staff were bludgeoned to death with a croquet mallet. There is rumor of a ghost at the school and several recent sightings. When Bunty disappears, and Morse discovers that Mr. Weiss had recently been in contact with the author of a book about the old case, Morse can't get the century-old murders out of his mind, in spite of everyone else's preoccupation with the World Cup.

""Sway"" begins as the wife of an Oxford professor, Mrs. Vivienne Haldane, is found strangled to death with a black silk stocking around her neck. This is the third in a series of similar murders, and CS Bright (Anton Lesser) is anxious to avoid a panic. Morse and DI Thursday focus their attention on Burridge's Department Store, the only retailer that sold this particular brand of silk stocking, a French import called ""Le Minou Noir"". Some inventory has gone missing from Burridge's, as has some cash, which put the store's exacting manager Mr. Quinbury (Tim McMullan) in a foul mood, while the heir to the business, Alan Burridge (Joe Bannister), is just getting his feet wet in his new position and seems unnerved by the police presence. Thursday walks into a meeting and sees someone from his past: Mrs. Luisa Armstrong (Ccile Paoli), whom he knew well in Italy during the War. The womanizing wholesaler who supplied the stockings, Mr. Joey Lisk (Matt Wrottesley) begins to look like a good suspect, as Morse becomes more friendly with his neighbor Monica (Shvorne Marks).

""Neverland"", the season cliffhanger, intertwines a case of 10-year-old runaway Tommy Cork (Louis Ashbourne Serkis) and the body of murdered hack journalist Eric Patterson found near some train tracks. Morse's journalist friend Dorothea Frazil (Abigail Thaw) knew Patterson; she intended to meet with him to discuss the redevelopment of an old boy's reform school at Blenheim Vale into a new police HQ, a subject in which Patterson took some interest. An escaped convict, George Aldridge, is connected to both cases. Morse, improbably, discovers a code in Aldridge's rosary beads. The trail leads back to events in the past, and Morse suspects a coverup on the force. Meanwhile, DI Thursday is contemplating retirement and becoming disillusioned with his colleagues. This episode gives us bizarre and implausible characters and plot -and Morse reciting poetry to Thursday in a moment of crisis. I couldn't begin to count the absurd coincidences.",1406246400,4,5792,4.997927461139897

If the BBC is going to spoil the series with tricks like this, we will no longer be fans.

It was also annoying to see scene after scene--even in the presumably adequately-lit police headquarters--filmed in such darkness that it was like a preview of how it would be to be losing one's sight. We began to wonder if the BBC was deliberately using dim lighting so as to save money by avoiding the necessity of creating detailed and authentic surroundings.

6362558,5,B00JJRLFTU,"I would urge viewers to watch both series 1 and 2 in HD/BluRay/and on a large screen. You will experience a feast for the eyes. I was amazed at the artistry, care and skill that went into the composition of each and every shot. Last night I watched the third installment of series 2 on my PBS network. Toward the beginning this episode, we are treated to a view of a double decker bus in the fog, at night, which lasts all of two or three seconds. The absolutely superb quality of this snippet of film is very instructive and  representative. The dramatic lighting of the headlights piercing the shroud of fog, the composition, the sound, the sheer magnificence of that brief shot epitomize the lofty standards of this series. It took time to put that together; it would have been much, much easier, faster and cheaper to slap something together and move on. Later on we see the young Morse near his desk in the office of the Oxford police department. We feel we are actually there with him, amid the clutter, the wood desks and drawers, the papers, the dully painted walls and shadowy corners of a sixties-era city ""nick"". All of the interiors of the series have a warm and distinct look to them, as if the sets and black-suited actors had all been dusted with a magic compound which yields an authentic vintage look. The stately spires, ancient cloisters and towers of the beautiful colleges which grace the town are breathtaking in their beauty, and we are given ample opportunity to view them.

I am a fan of the Colin Dexter novels, and, though the Endeavor stories are not, to my knowledge, penned by Dexter, they certainly reflect his sensibility and touch. As we know, the middle-aged Morse was an irascible, impetuous, impatient, cerebral, Wagner-loving, hard-drinking, acrostic-addicted loner who had a talent for catching bad guys. It's especially enjoyable to see some of these traits already there, and emerging, in the twenty-something Morse.

The stories appeal to those of us who prefer not to have everything explained to us with crystal clarity. We don't want to see simplistic, hard-hitting heroes acting bravely. We yearn for real, breathing, struggling, imperfect human beings and not cardboard cutouts. In the third episode it is wonderfully gratifying to learn a great deal more about Morse's boss, CDI Thursday, played so ably and effectively by Roger Allam. Without divulging too much detail, a WWII lover of Thursday's, who he believed had died in the war, turns up working behind the counter in the hosiery department of a large Oxford department store. Allam's work here is incredible as his face registers, in turn, the shock, the yearning, the heartbreak of his one great love.

I am so grateful that the creators of this show have been smart enough to spare us the plethora of gigantic closeups, shaking cameras and frenetic cuts that are characteristic of so many TV programs these days. The only current series which compare, visually, to this one are Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife.

I recently watched what I believe is the very first Morse mystery, called The Dead of Jericho, from 1987, of course starring the late, great John Thaw. Young Lewis (Kevin Whately) had not even officially met Morse in that first go-round, knew of him only by reputation. Morse is ever the hopeless romantic who's head is easily turned by attractive women of any age, and he is drawn to a fellow chorus singer, played by Gemma Jones (Sense and Sensibility, Duchess of Duke Street). It is a wonder to see the differences between the first Morse mysteries and these new Endeavor films. It's like night and day in terms of photography and composition....not to mention sharpness.",1405296000,3,3696,4.841772151898734

6362561,3,B00JJRLFTU,"Endeavour returns with four new episodes chronicling Detective Chief Inspector Morse' early days with the Oxford City Police. The initial  film opens with the young detective returning to duty after recovering from injuries sustained at the close of the first season thereby continuing the semi-serialized form. Series 1 had a different tone from that of the Morse films and series 2 continues in the same vein. Essentially ""Inspector Morse"" was character driven, episodic, modern gothic and often melancholy, while ""Endeavour"" is plot centric, serialized, and at times violent with a film noire affectation.  While the episodes are supposed to follow a chronology that traces young Morse' development into the Chief Inspector we know he will become, they feel oddly disconnected.  This is partly a result of hiring different directors for each film which can be a problem with prequels when each of those  directors has a different take on the original material.  Additionally, the producers have chosen to craft story lines that are less about the title character than they are about the people around him; a significant departure from both the Thaw films and the Dexter novels.  This is the same approach Masterpiece took with ""Inspector Lewis"" and is fundamentally why the original Morse audience became so disappointed with that series.

After the first season I had a specific concern that each episode would be resolved by Endeavour stumbling across some arcane clue that only he could properly interpret. I'm pleased to see that they have corrected that problem in these latest episodes as one of the most difficult tasks a writer faces is letting their characters mature and develop. Correspondingly Endeavour's relationship with his co-workers seems to have improved as both Superintendent Bright and DS Jakes have moderated their disdain towards him which was overly prominent in the initial season.  In addition the writers have worked in more touchstones to the Thaw series such as when DI Thursday, briefly considering retirement, tries to reassure Morse that he could work for DI McNutt, a character from the Morse film ""Masonic Mysteries"", who was a mentor to Morse later in his career. Likewise in another episode we see Endeavour preparing a report on the amalgamation of several police departments into the Thames Valley Police Constabulary which would become his place of employment twenty years in the future. Finally, Colin Dexter is very briefly in a couple scenes continuing the traditional homage to the writer's eponymous novels. As with the premier and initial series the production values, cinematography, time period authenticity and casting are superb; and yet I feel the series has not reached it's potential due to a none too subtle attempt by PBS to influence the production for it's own commercial purposes.

First off; PBS has trimmed an additional 4 to 5 minutes off the run time for each episode so what you get with a disc purchase is essentially the same video as was shown on the television broadcasts.  In Season 1 the episodes ran approximately an hour and 33 minutes which PBS would then edit out 7 or 8 minutes to fit the television time slot, but the home video discs were left intact.  Sometimes the deleted material was inconsequential, but more often it was germane to the narrative.  While one might think a few minutes wouldn't amount to much over the course of a 90 minute presentation, it often was a scene where much of the Morse character was being revealed to an audience that might not have familiarity with the source material on which this new series is based.  Those who first met Morse in the John Thaw films will recall those were produced for the UK home market as 2 hour commercial features which equated to an hour and 44 minutes of actual run time.  When the series was picked up by PBS they were broadcast intact on the hosted venue ""PBS Mystery!""  which ran one to two hours depending on the syndicated material being broadcast.  But when PBS created ""Masterpiece Mystery"" as a production entity they adopted a fixed 90 minute time slot that continues to draw criticism whenever they try to force fit properties onto the platform.  The whole purpose of the Masterpiece production enterprise seems to be centered on controlling the format and content of the material being broadcast which, in my opinion, is not in the best interest of the viewing audience.  Increasingly PBS seems to be more focused on the branding, and demographic potential of it's dramatic lineup than it is with underlying quality.  Stylistic characteristics have become common among recent Masterpiece programs thereby feeding a larger but perhaps less discerning audience homogenous and, dare I say, dumbed down productions rife with contrived plot lines lacking the nuance and character development the earlier independently produced dramas were most admired for.

Secondly, the discs include the same brand advertising for a fashion designer and cruise ship line that was included on the television broadcasts.  This has become a pattern with PBS in recent years and is ironic for a network whose member stations still widely trumpet themselves as commercial free.  I have no problem with PBS adopting advertising as a revenue source, but to include it on home video products you're asked to pay for seems at the very least in poor taste. Including trailers of other films in a dvd distributer's catalog is common and, while at times annoying, is generally considered harmless; but actual paid advertising for third party commercial interests?  If you were to purchase a season of another network's prime time series and got toothpaste and insurance commercials most people would be rightfully upset. I don't see why PBS shouldn't be held to the same standard.

Finally, I'm not going to give away any plot information, but the series takes a particularly jarring turn at the end of the final episode.  Rather than the dramatic cliff hanger it was meant to be, it comes across as a clumsy theatrical device aimed at nothing more than hype for a story line that had reached it's thematic conclusion well before the final scene. It's the sort of thing one finds in prime time soap operas made infamous by the ""Who shot JR?"" story arc from ""Dallas"".  Additionally, the episode relies on a plot line remarkably similar to another 60's era UK police drama drawing much from ""Gently in the Cathedral"", the 5th season finale of ""George Gently"".  Besides being a rip-off from a competing series, it's such an obviously tacked on anticlimax that it only could have come from some unnamed Masterpiece production executive who imagined such tripe to be cutting edge drama. Nothing in the Thaw series nor the Dexter novels makes any reference to such a ridiculous story arc.  No conversation between Lewis and Morse and no aside between Strange and Morse even hints at such an event.  Both the Thaw films and the Dexter novels provided numerous glimpses into Morse' past and if ""this"" had happened, it would have been topic one.  While there's one possible explanation that would comport with the existing narrative for part of this bizarre turn, there's also a dozen  more likely scenarios that would seem better suited to the saga's overall theme.  Even if some wide-eyed innocent were to buy this effluvium as a legitimate plot turn it falls apart as soon as one realizes that Endeavour went on to become a senior detective and had his cases chronicled in the 80's and 90's. To be credible as a cliff hanger there has to be some believability that such an event could have happened. We know that the character lived his life and progressed in his career so there's no point to such artifice. It's pure hokum dreamed up by writers who are apparently incapable of recreating the quality of the original series and are just making this stuff up without any regard for the thematic integrity of the existing literature.  If they were dead set on lifting a plot line from another series a more satisfying approach would have been to create a two part episode contained within a single season rather than leaving the viewers with this sort of comic book contrivance to ponder over the off season.  It's completely out of character for the Morse franchise and reeks of ratings centric thinking.

Somewhere along the line PBS has confused their proven ability to recognize quality drama with the inherent talent required to create it. Masterpiece has had a checkered history as a production entity and PBS may have to reassess whether they would be better off solely broadcasting programs brought to fruition by independent producers rather than attempting to micro manage the creative process. Too many of PBS's recent dramas seem to be driven by a desire to ""brand"" each feature with recognizable ""Masterpiece"" flourishes thereby robbing the characters and plot lines of the uniqueness and variety that so many of the independent productions are most admired for.  If they would let ITV Studios run with the project rather than mucking it up with hokey cliff hanger endings and politically correct romantic threads this could be a classic in the making. But unless PBS reverses course and keeps their hands off the production values I fear it's more likely to devolve into another ""Inspector Lewis""; a Morse sequel of once great promise and initial enthusiasm that limped to the finish with lackluster episodes.",1405209600,81,9438,5.004469987228608
