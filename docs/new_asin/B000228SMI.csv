2056143,4,B000228SMI,"Fans of the original 1959 Roger Corman flick will undoubtedly remember the delightful Susan Cabot as the title character, and will also undoubtedly enjoy this campy remake, produced by none other than Mr. Corman himself.
We meet Jennifer Rubin as Janice Starlin, the aging owner of a cosmetics firm.  She has ALWAYS been the model spokeswoman for her company, but now she's a little too wrinkled and elderly to carry this post on, or so her fellow owners think (including the delightfully smarmy Gerritt Graham).  So Janice learns of a doctor (played quite woodenly by Daniel J. Travanti) who has found that using a serum made from bee venom can make one younger.  He experiments on a little kitty cat he finds in the alley and lo and behold, the cat gets younger, not to mention the fact that the poor puss also turns into a beecat!!!  Anyway, Rubin uses the serum and voila, she's young and beautiful again, but also has advanced cases of paranoid delusions, and oh, yes, when she gets really horny, she turns into the titular monstrosity.
The movie is a true B movie, and captures the feel of those wonderfully overwrought films of the 50s.  Rubin is effective as the wasp woman; Doug Wert as her main hunk Alec is heroically adroit; and the whole movie preaches about the cost of vanity.  The wasp woman creature isn't the greatest of effects, but it fits this charmingly nostalgic movie.  BEE ENTERTAINED!!!",1088208000,13,1412,4.738775510204082
8020407,4,B000228SMI,"Hard to find, forgotten, re-make of a Roger Corman movie of the same name... this one in color...
Quite a lot of nudity, SF/X, and absurdity. Jennifer Rubin seeks a fountain of youth. The acting is
adequate, though NOT Oscar-worthy. The best part is the were-wasp morph scenes which remind
ME of the ""Cat People"", remake, with its added nudity... blood, boobs, and booty!",1496880000,,371,4.8125

8020410,5,B000228SMI,"If you like movies that involve Roger Corman, this is one of them, great remake of the original. enjoy.",1441238400,,103,4.473684210526316
8020411,2,B000228SMI,"This movie is laughably bad particularly in its practical effects work, although it's probably better written than most ultra-cheap horror movies from the era. It might owe that to being a remake of an earlier film.

The only genuinely positive quality is Maria Ford's full-frontal nude sex scene, which is disappointingly brief. There is some additional nudity but lead actress Jennifer Rubin cheats and uses a very unconvincing body double.

You might be able to get a fun party viewing out of it.",1412985600,,499,5.0
8020412,3,B000228SMI,"Roger Corman's New Horizons/Concorde company commissioned a number of remakes of Corman's classic films with the hopes of selling them to pay cable companies as exclusive content. Films like ""Piranha"", ""Humanoids from the Deep"", ""Bucket of Blood"", and others were all given cheap face-lifts to reuse old ideas. Most of these films were terrible, but some of them were so over the top that they ended up being entertaining.

Jim Wynorski's remake of ""The Wasp Woman"" is one of the better installments with quite a bit of nudity, special effects and absurdity. Jennifer Rubin does an admirable job as the aging corporate woman seeking a fountain of youth and, while the rest of the acting is low rent, there's nothing glaringly embarrassing. The best part is the werewasp transformation scenes which recall the sexual danger of Paul Schrader's ""Cat People"".

That's not to say there's anything highbrow about this one; it's just another piece of dumb fun with blood and boobs aplenty. If that sounds good to you, this is worth a watch.",1407628800,3,1033,4.965317919075145
8020413,4,B000228SMI,"A modern remake of a cheeseball favorite, with a little cheesecake thrown in. A cautionary tale about this dangers of seeking external youth.",1384041600,,141,5.173913043478261
8020414,3,B000228SMI,Saw this movie as a childhood thrill. wanted to rewatch it and relive the childhood life style again. Crazy movie.,1375056000,,114,4.75
8020415,3,B000228SMI,"I don't know why I like this movie so much, but I do. When I had it on VHS I watched it regularly. The morphing effects are terrible, but the actual creature effects are practical and it's awesome to see a fully realized giant wasp monster. It's something that's rarely seen and, frankly, cool to look at. Based on the monster alone, this remake completely trumps the original. Everything else about the movie is sub-par by Hollywood standards, but in the low budget made-for-TV horror genre it's pretty good. The pace may be slower than one expects, as it also tries to be an erotic thriller with more emphasis on drama than the typical horror movie has. The only problem is the movie's far too campy for the viewer to get wrapped up in the attempts at drama. Jennifer Rubin does what she can with the role and it's nice to see the cool chick from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 get her own movie. Her manly, waspish performance holds the movie together and entertains. Nothing's incredible, but it's all very watchable, and re-watchable for a fan of low budget monster movies. This Showtime original is better than a typical SyFy original.

The picture quality of the DVD may leave fans feeling unfulfilled. The source is probably tape, as there are quite a few instances where dropout/white lines appear. It does look better than any of the VHS tapes I transferred to DVD myself and if it wasn't for the dropout I'd have been fooled. Whether it's VHS, Beta, or 3/4"" I don't know; it's equal to the DVDs made from tape masters that Lionsgate has been known to put out (i.e. Chopping Mall). Due to the nature of the program, this very well may have been shot on tape. All-in-all, considering the content, I'm OK with the transfer. I'd be curious to know how this DVD holds up to the LaserDisc (with much better cover art) that was released.

The only extra is a trailer promising exactly what the viewer gets.",1362787200,6,1907,4.556851311953353
8020416,5,B000228SMI,"The wasp woman by new horizon films is a great movie. it reminds me of a combination of the movie ""The Fly"", and the movie ""species"". i would highly recommend it to anyone that likes those two films.",1340323200,5,199,4.2631578947368425
