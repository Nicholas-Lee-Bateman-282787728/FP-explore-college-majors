6028526,3,B00FRILRL6,"Known for bringing a hip edge to populist genre pictures that focus mainly on high-octane action with a heavy dose of U.S.-influenced pop culture, Luc Besson is a French filmmaker who directed some terrifically audacious films in the nineties (1994's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-The-Professional/dp/B00170F0WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon: The Professional</a>, 1997's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element/dp/B000S6BKSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element</a>) but has largely focused on producing and writing since the millennium. He comes back to the director's chair with this 2013 mob comedy which bears his signature mark of extreme, almost fanatical violence within the context of a story that already feels unsettled as neither a crime melodrama nor a family situation comedy. With a screenplay co-written with Michael Caleo, Besson has made a tonally unbalanced film whose primary saving grace is an adroit cast headed by Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. Neither is a stranger to this milieu as they appear to play extensions of characters they've already played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodfellas/dp/B002ZM74Y6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodfellas</a>&nbsp;(which is given a cheeky nod in the plot) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Married-to-the-Mob/dp/0792845811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Married to the Mob</a>. That's fine by me since both bring a world-weary finesse to their portrayals that elevate the cartoonish movie into something close to human if not quite humane.

The fancifully graphic story focuses on Giovanni Manzoni, his wife Maggie, their daughter Belle and their son Warren. He is a second-generation mobster who decides to turn state's evidence against Don Luchese, a Brooklyn crime kingpin. After a failed attempt to rub out Manzoni at a family barbecue, Luchese is sent to prison, and in turn, the Manzoni tribe enters the Witness Protection Program where they end up being renamed the Blakes and relocating from the south of France to a village in Normandy. Each family member has trouble fitting in because they all share the same volatile temper and the same immoral sensibility to solve any problem with brutalizing violence. Manzoni is Fred Blake who pretends to be a history author writing about the Normandy landings and beats up a plumber who tries to rip him off. In my favorite scene of the movie, Maggie blows up a local grocery store when the proprietor and local customers make fun of American vulgarity in French. Belle pummels a would-be lothario with a tennis racket after he tricks her into joining him and his buddies for a not-so-innocent picnic. Warren seeks revenge against the local school bullies by creating a confederacy of outcasts with sought-after skills and connections.

All their proclivities come to a head when Luchese discovers their whereabouts through the most contrived of circumstances. De Niro can play this type of role in his sleep, but credit him for not making this another Fockers sleepfest as he brings genuine warmth to a character that finds a cathartic release in his newfound purpose in writing his memoirs. Even in her bleached blond flashbacks, Pfeiffer displays her shopworn beauty with little vanity and manages to create an empathetic character out of what could have been a shrewish caricature. Tommy Lee Jones plays exactly to type as the stoic agent who leads the protection detail for Manzoni.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glee/dp/B00FGNETJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glee</a>&nbsp;alumnus Dianna Agron brings a refreshing calmness to the role of a bad girl who is at heart a soulful teen falling in love for the first time while never forgetting her obligation to the family. John D'Leo fits well into the deadpan demeanor of a been-there, done-that kid brother as Warren. But Besson just doesn't know how to mesh the considerable comic chops of his core cast with the violence he wants to showcase, especially in the final gun battle sequence, which would have been fine in a straight-ahead actioner but just refuses to bring this truly absurdist movie together. It's a marginal disappointment considering all who is involved in this production including executive producer Martin Scorsese.",1386374400,5,4455,6.036334913112165

I didn't know what to expect or if I could sit through another mafia type movie.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The entire cast was fantastic, but especially the two lead women, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dianna Agron.  Robert DeNiro is always good.  They all tackled a little bit of comedy, drama and even some thriller in it.  This is one of those movies that is difficult to pin down to one particular genre.  It was much better than I expected.",1386115200,2,544,4.479591836734694
6028529,5,B00FRILRL6,Great Dark Comedy with great acting from start to finish.  I am a HUGE De Niro fan so I had to see this even though some reviews were not that good.  No idea what they were thinking...this movie was great!,1386028800,5,205,4.1
6028530,3,B00FRILRL6,"Fred Blake / Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) and family are in the witness protection program. The mafia has a $20 million price tag on their heads. They have just moved into Normandy. Tommy Lee Jones is their FBI contact. The movie plays light Italian music to induce us into thinking it is a comedy. There are numerous humorous moments, but it is far from a knee slapper. The characters are stereotyped, as is the mafia, minus the token character named Fat Tony...they use Fat Willie instead.

The family has to endure the snobbish French, all the while desiring to smash their faces, which sometimes they do. The writing was lackluster and flat. As contradictory as this sounds, the film relies heavily on stereotypes, yet at the same time fails to exploit the stereotypes to create a smart comedy. If you are going to do one, you have to do the other.

The kids at school scene begins as if it is going to be a smart comedy, but then fizzles. The affection Belle (Dianna Agron) develops for her math tutor was a complete bore and waste of time. Both De Niro's character and his wife Michelle Pfeiffer were poorly utilized outside of a few scenes.

Makes for a decent rental. Wait for a price crash to own.

6028531,2,B00FRILRL6,"""There was a time when I had it all. People would ask me, what was it like being untouchable? The question they really should have asked was, what happens when it's all over?"" After Giovanni (De Niro) a high ranking mobster turns state's evidence him and his family are relocated (again) to Normandy, France. The only problem is that between him, his wife Maggie (Pfeiffer) and their two kids have a hard time adjusting to the normal life. After an innocent act allows their past to catch up with them they must confront it head on. I have said before that De Niro is a great actor but will do just about anything. From the young Godfather to Fearless Leader or a Vietnam vet to a gay pirate he does have incredible range. With him doing so many movies there are going to be many hits and misses. While this movie is pretty much what I expected it's nothing amazing. It's not a straight up mob comedy like Analyze This was but it's also not a serious Goodfellas type. I will say the scene where Giovanni is asked to review a movie is great only because of the one they picked. Overall, I expected it to be just OK but really a movie produced by Scorsese, directed by Luc Besson and starring De Niro should be much better then this. I give it a C+.",1384560000,3,1247,4.31063829787234
6028532,3,B00FRILRL6,"Luc Bessons latest movie The Family is typical example of a film where a wealth of great talent is wasted on the thin material. The film has a great cast of actors including Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dianna Agron, some interesting characters and beautiful photography (by Thierry Arbogast), while striving to find a story to tell.

Based on a book by Tonino Benacquista and co-executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, The Family (also known as Malavita meaning Badfellas) chronicles the life of a former mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni, now Fred Blake, and his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and two children Belle (Dianna Agron) and Warren (John D'Leo) living in a quiet village in Normandy, France, under FBI witness protection plan. The American family has some run-ins with locals who do not know their true identity, despite the advice from FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones).

The Family suffers from the inconsistent tone as a result of the lack of story. As a comedy it is too violent; as a gangster film it is too absurd (FBI and mafia in France?). Those violence-prone characters suddenly get weak during the shoot-out. Reference to one classic gangster movie (by Martin Scorsese) is mildly amusing, but not enough. The subplot about Belle and the math teacher goes nowhere.

This is regrettable because the younger players Dianna Agron and John D'Leo are so good, almost stealing scenes from veterans. I wanted to know much more about their characters and how they dominate the school, than the clichd culture clash episodes or tired and pointless action.",1384473600,,1602,5.0606060606060606
6028533,4,B00FRILRL6,"It was a good move for Robert DeNiro to return to something mobsterish after his turn in the bottom of my yearly movie list, ""The Big Wedding"". ""The Family"" is a comedy/crime drama from well-known action director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, Leon: The Professional & Taken). Many American movie actors are going abroad to film their action movies these days and for the most part, theyve all been pretty terrible; for instance, ""Live Free or Die Hard"", ""Taken 2"", ""From Paris with Love"" and ""The Cold Light of Day"", two of which Luc Besson had a part in. So, does ""The Family"" fall into that mold?

DeNiro plays Giovanni Manzoni, a mobster in the witness protection program that turned on his cronies and is now a heavily monitored and frequent mover. His family, Maggie, Belle and Warren are products of their father. They have learned a few things about getting what they want and defending themselves. With their new home in Normandy, France, they struggle to hide their nature.

The movie trailer plays into the movies comedy and the description of the movie leads with the word comedy. While I found a lot of the movie pretty funny, I think it is important to not go into the movie expecting to be humored like one of our American version crude comedies. Go into ""The Family"" not knowing what to expect and youll find that it tackles many genres of film and has a good range of comedy, action, drama, and to top it off, some quality suspense.

To be honest, some of Luc Bessons earlier films are some of my favorite movies Ive ever seen because those movies had amazing characters and great personality. Besson, lately though, has had a tendency to overwhelm the viewer with relentless shooting from cruddy characters who you could care less about. This is thankfully not the case in ""The Family"". While pretty much everybody in the film has a layer of crud to them, you begin to see an interesting thing develop as the movie plays out; a redeeming nature to the crud.

Go into ""The Family"" expecting to see a comedy and you may be disappointed. This is Luc Bessons homage to the gangster personality. He couldn't have asked for a better man to walk in the lead characters role in DeNiro. In fact, the film also pays homage to one of DeNiros finest movies, ""Goodfellas"". This isn't the Coens ""Millers Crossing"", but the mood of the film may be similar. It isn't a comedy. It is a gangster film that isn't afraid to make you laugh, cry and lean forward in your seat as the stuff starts to go down.",1383609600,76,2503,4.567928730512249
6028534,1,B00FRILRL6,"Did DiNiro and Pfeiffer not read the script before signing on to this hateful film? I walked out about two-thirds of the way through--couldn't take it anymore. It is one inexplicable violent episode after another. It is stupidly chauvinistic (the original sense of the word). All through it, I was hoping the film would not be shown in France, but I was in Paris a few weeks ago and the movie was in the theatres. What a sorry representation of America!",1383350400,6,453,4.604938271604938
6028535,4,B00FRILRL6,"May be spoilers below.

I really had not a clue what this movie was about.  But it had good actors in it, so I and we decided to go see it.  It was one of the oddest movies I have ever seen.  It was so violent.  Not just the husband, who was in the mob.  But the wife and their two kids also.  When they got mad, they would just beat the hell out of people.  At the same time, it was also funny.  In a dark comedy sort of way.  I laughed a bunch of times.  It was really about a man who was in the mob, who snitched and was now in hiding.

It has Tommy Lee Jones, who I did not know was in the movie.  The acting was great from all the actors.  But it was an odd movie.  My mom said it best.  It was the type of movie that you will either love or hate.  I liked it very much.  I think something else that made it different, is that it was not filmed in the US.  Well, it was not supposed to be in the US.  I've no clue the location it was actually filmed.  But you can see the man trying to live his life as if he were a normal man and not from the mob.  He thinks twice about killing two people, but then it comes back and you see he was just thinking about it and did not do it.

Some things did not really work well.  Like his daughter getting so upset that a guy did not want to run away with her.  She thought he was her first true love.  Just because of the way his eyes looked to her.  Then the thing she was going to do after it all was way to crazy.  Then the son wanting to leave when he was under 18 to join the family.  I mean, if his father was so wanted by the mob and all they wanted to do was kill him and his family.  How in the hell was his son expecting to go join?  As soon as they found his son, he would be dead.

All the pros and cons of this movie, it still was something I enjoyed.  I would buy it one day.  That is when it was down to a good price.",1383264000,4,1874,3.6256281407035176

6028592,5,B00FRILRL6,"This black comedy is an absolutely hilarious mafia spoof directed by Luc Besson who places an American mafia family under FBI protection in a small Normandy village. Mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni (played by Robert Di Nero) became an FBI witness against the Luchese mafia family, and Don Luchase has put out a murder contract on Giovanni and his wife and children from prison. Di Niro performs brilliantly in this black comedy role and he is matched by the everlastingly gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer who performs with equal comedic brilliance in the role Giovanni's wife Maggie. The mafia family children Belle and Warren share the psychopathic personalities of their parents and I could not fault their acting. Obviously you cannot deposit a family of American mafia psychopaths in a quiet French town and expect the family members to respect local French values, and that is where the black comedy arises. Any difficulties for the American mafia family members arising from the French townsfolk are met with extreme violence by both adults and children. I appreciate that the violence in this film is confronting, but it is not the stuff of fantasy. Anyone familiar with the history of the mafia in America will recognise behaviour in this film that has a basis in fact.",1478304000,,1267,5.009478672985782

His immediate family - wife (played by beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer) and children (daughter ans son) are on board about their father's former occupation and reasons for hiding.  But this is a colorful bunch of well adjusted sociopaths.  It is so funny to watch both children fight for their place in the school.  As frequently ""new"" to the school, they are often target of harassment (physical an sexual) from their peers.  But they are not afraid to fend for themselves.  And gangster's wife is no angel either.  She is a good wife who can cook and take care of family, but if the grocery store owners piss her off - they are doing so on their own peril.

6028599,3,B00FRILRL6,"The Family(released Sept/13)stars,among others, Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones,Dianna Agron and  John D'Leo. Directed by Luc Besson this is a film that tries to be smart but fails in its attempt.
The story finds DeNiro as an ex crime boss who has ratted out some of his colleagues,which has put he and his family into witness protection. They have moved frequently over time and this film puts them in a French village called Cholong. DeNiro has a quick temper and will take no garbage from anyone;then he acts on his impulse of the moment. His wife also has a temper but hers takes a little longer to surface. When it does it can be as devastating as DeNiro's. Their son is a player and hustler and smart. Their daughter is a chip off the old mother. Through an inadvertent slip up the hit men eventually track the family down, but ultimately fail in their mission,as the family packs up and heads into the setting sun to yet another town.
All of the leads are solid in their portrayals,the kids especially. This is not a stretch part for Deniro, as he has played similar characters during his career. Pfeiffer's Brooklyn-ese comes and goes,but she is generally good. Besson has seemed to have gone for a less is more approach with the whole tone of the film. However that is its downfall. As the movie meanders along I just couldn't get into it for any length of time. Added to this is the sub par script. Just as it would get interesting,the film would veer off the track ,go somewhere else to pick up another piece of the puzzle,go back to yet another part,and on and on..It just couldn't build up a steady stream of steam to sustain itself for the entire length of the film. Did it want to be a comedy? Serious? It couldn't make up its mind.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. The trailer is the one extra. Whoopee.
All in all a top notch cast is wasted in this wandering and slow paced time waster. They do their best, but it is beyond their grasp to save it. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1475884800,,2047,4.429708222811671

Fred Blake/Giovanni Manzoni/Robert De Niro is the father, who cannot keep himself from writing his memoirs and exposing his family.

6028647,4,B00FRILRL6,"I enjoyed this film. It is tempting to put it to very exalted standards because DeNiro is the lead and Luc Besson the director. That's a fairly heady combination and one is used to thinking of major award winning films. Well, they didn't do that here. They made an entertaining film that is a good night's entertainment. I would be very surprised to hear it was playing at ANY film festivals or winning any major awards.

The gist of this film is that this entire mob connected family is in witness protection. This is not their first spot to set down roots. The problem is that they don't exactly fit in anywhere else. The wife has an annoying habit of burning down markets when she hears patrons and owner gossiping about her. When the son is set upon by school bullies, he knows how to launch the long game of pay back and taking control. When the daughter is driven by teen boys to the lake with ideas of sexually assaulting her, she beats one of them almost to death with a tennis racket and leaves with the car. And they are mild compared to the pater familias, DeNIro. He is the one who is also funniest though. When he decides to retaliate against anyone, there is almost always a heavy dose of humor attached.

I THINK this is set in France. I was a bit unsure because everyone was speaking American English and I doubt everyone in France does that on an everyday casual basis. So there was some artistic license taken, which did not bother me.",1445472000,,1453,4.417910447761194

This movie is not about redemption nor is there any regrets about the life lived by these family members.  The events in the film are simply the everyday adventures for this unique though morally questionable American family.  The film is a glimpse into how these individuals deal with daily situations that arise for each individual where right and wrong, good or bad, legal or illegal are concepts for another day, if ever.

6028678,4,B00FRILRL6,"The Family
 The Family brings together an outstanding cast following the lead of writer/director Luc Besson.  This might not be up to the very best of Bessons work but I found it funny and entertaining.  Besson also both wrote and directed The Fifth Element which we love so much at our house that our cat is named after one of the characters.  He also wrote and directed La Femme Nikita a truly exciting thriller.  Besson has a touch so deft and light that he has made a completely satisfying comedic film-no matter that the characters include a psychopath Mafia gangster, his loving wife, daughter and son, killers all.
 It helps any movie if your leading man is Robert De Niro.  It also helps if your leading lady is Machelle Pfeiffer.  De Niro portrays a Mafia goon who has sold out his friends to the FBI.  Pfeiffer plays his wife with her very best Brooklyn accent, something she has saved up from her role in Married to the Mob just for this film.  She keeps us in stitches.  After selling out his pals, the mobster and his family are imbedded in the Witness Protection Program.  They hilariously have trouble adapting to ordinary life and end up in a small town in Normandy, France.  Delicious.
 The Family is very much R rated for bad words and casual violence.  The Burke family just cannot seem to change their ways.  The scenes of the teenagers adapting to their new life I found particularly funny.  Not that the situations would be considered funny but because the actors and the writer/director made them funny.
 Martin Scorsese is among the producers of The Family.  He and his fellows allowed Besson a mere $30 million to make the film.  This is a small, clever film of no great importance but it is leagues ahead of most of what we have seen since early summer.  It should reward producer Scorsese with a nice profit.  It will surely reward the viewers with a pleasant time in the darkness with their popcorn and soda.
 This film can fairly be given a three and a half saw blade rating.  If you enjoy seeing truly world class actors working their magic in a minor film, you should like this as much as I did.  Also see Tommy Lee Jones appearing in a supporting role as the FBI man tasked with the impossible chore of keeping the Burke family under wraps, alive and out of jail.",1435881600,2,2295,4.512135922330097

Family traveling across country in a hatchback with a dead body in the back but no one seems to notice.  De Niro's character put it back there. Michelle Pfeiffer's character torches a small store in broad daylight while it's open for business. More to the point, she's the only one shopping. She torches it because the guy behind the counter said mean things about Americans.  No cops show up at their door.  The school bully pounds on the son because he's a hated American. Daughter pounds on same bully because bully is being a perv. Than son pounds on same bully - pay back for orig pounding. Still no cops at their door.  Daughter also pounds on some girl in the school bathroom.  No cops yet.  Dad pounds on plumber doing an inspection at their home. Dad takes plumber to the hospital and then sticks around looking at x-rays trying to explain how guy fell down the stairs. Plumber guy is awake and grunting through his traquea tube.  Still no cops at the door.  I didn't care for any of the characters and with the non existent plot - what a waste of time and money.

It does make me wonder who the intended audience was for this movie.  Writer seems to think that our egos are so inflated that we will get off on all the beatings and killings because the victims were american hating foreigners.

Even better, they both think it's perfectly normal to kill and maim innocent people on a whim. Best of all, the denouement has lots more innocent people being shot to death by pretty much everyone concerned. Hilarious, right? I mean, what's not to love? Violence, brutality, stupidity... surely this is the stuff of great comedy.

Well, in fact, no. This is a tedious and boring film about stupid brutal empty people. If you think 9/11 was absolutely hilarious and that Islamic State slaughtering unarmed innocent people is just a merry jape, and if you think guns are perfect props for every conceivable joke then this is the movie for you.

Otherwise, if you have any shred of human sensibility, avoid this atrocious concoction at all costs. It is utterly without any redeeming feature aside from the fact that it does, eventually, end. Those involved in the making of this disgusting piece of filth should be totally ashamed of themselves.",1420934400,2,1060,4.850828729281768

6028747,5,B00FRILRL6,"Walking out of the neighborhood super market, I spotted this DVD in a bin offered for 6 bucks. With Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, I figured, what have I got to lose? It turned out to be about the best money I've ever spent on a gangster flick. DeNiro, of course, is a natural to portray a mobster; Pfeiffer, after her role as an innocent in ""Married to the Mob,"" changes chameleon-like to a typical hard edged and supporting mob wife. Dianna Agron and John D'Leo, who play their teen children, are perfect in their chosen roles. And of course, the mobsters tasked with rubbing out the entire family, are dark and truly scary. Further, kudos to those who chose the musical score to add mood and color for each scene; an added factor in rounding out this thriller as one of the best for my money.

This film could also be titled,""The F-Word Movie,"" as it is used so often throughout the film. However, it is not offensive (to me at least) but shows the many meanings that crude expression can have from what was originally intended; its constant variety of uses is what makes this flick so darned funny. Plus, the last four words scripted for DeNiro to speak at the end left me doubled up with laughter. Buy it; borrow it; or steal it from your neighbor, and then thank Martin Scorsese for yet another great movie.",1417737600,,1319,4.495833333333334

6028764,1,B00FRILRL6,"Was this a Luc Besson film?  I had to check the end credits and look it up on the internet to confirm my anxieties. This movie was poorly put together with the exception of the last 10 minutes, and even that was over-the-top and predictable.  I've given up on Deniro after his last great acting job in ""The Score"".  Michelle Pfieffer? Very random.  Beyond the casting I couldn't quite understand the direction and flow of the movie.  The plot wasn't hard to establish and understand as a viewer, but focusing on each character's personalities and motivations did not make me laugh or convince me to cheer for any of them.  The story centers around a mobster family under the guise of the witness protection program sent to France to evade mobsters back in NY that want to take ""The Family"" out.

The movie was listed as a ""dark comedy"", but it was an ""obnoxious comedy"" with mindless violence catered to males ranging in the demographic of 16-30.  The one scene that comes to mind is when Michelle Pfieffer goes into the local grocery store and overhears the local townspeople mocking Americans.  She feels repulsed and offended to the point of blowing up the grocery store, killing the townspeople inside and fleeing the scene with a smirk on her face.  I will spare you the other mindless scenes displayed by each character.  Nothing of the characters actions or behavior were refreshing.  The only bright spot of the film was the last 10 minutes that had suspense, drama, and intrigue woven together as I'm used to seeing in Luc Besson films.  The glimmer didn't last long and we unfortunately were stuck with a poorly written movie that didn't provide any laughs or refreshing moments; even the Goodfellas reference was cheap.

6028767,5,B00FRILRL6,"This film is both humorous and at the same time, very serious.  This mafia clan is clearly unrepentant, and resents their exile in Europe.  Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer play these two rolls so well.  De Niro may be on the run, but he still yearns for his former life.  Pfeiffer is dreading their next move, wanting to find some semblence of home, even if it is in a foreign land.  The kids are the real victims in this film, they are reaping the results of their parents actions.  The latter half of the film brings this fact to light, with a brutal sense of reality.  The early parts of this film are very funny, if one can get by De Niro's reliance on mafia justice in his dealings with the locals.  I recommend this film, both for its humor, but even more so for its reality.  JRV",1414540800,3,791,4.25503355704698

I found this movie The Family with Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Tommy Lee Jones, executive producer Martin Scorsese and directed by Luc Besson) to be entertaining and absolutely funny at the same time.  DeNiro has played a mob boss in many films and in this hilarious DVD he and his family are in the witness protection program.

The family has been relocated in France but the Mafia gangsters are searching for them and eventually find out their location.  There are many funny scenes in this movie as this former Mafia family attempt to adjust to life in France.  They manage to still retain their mob like habits which makes this a highly amusing and entertaining movie.

If you like comedy scenes in combination with mobster action you may want to check out this DVD.

I think many critics and audiences were expecting an overt comedy (and it certainly is funny) But,to me it was a dark comedy with even darker overtones,especially the allusions to past events. DeNiro gave a great bumbling,almost bewildered performance. If accepted for what it is,it won't disappoint. Going in with preconceived expectations may be off putting. It's a dark comedy,with DeNiro playing his mob affiliation role in an entirely different slant than people are used to. The whole cast is convincing as well.",1409529600,,539,5.206896551724138

6028834,2,B00FRILRL6,"This would have been a good movie if the family had been more likable. Twice the father is shown inflicting violence on others...but quickly the viewer discovered that it was only in his imagination. IF that were the case throughout the movie, and we saw that the [ex-mob] father had changed his ways, I could have laughed and enjoyed his character. Instead, he commits three acts of violence that are what I consider to be overboard: 1) He murders a man because he sold him lobster which was previously frozen, but claimed it was fresh. They do not show the murder, but do show the father burying the bloody body which had been stored in the trunk of his car, wrapped in plastic. 2) He beats a plumber with a baseball bat and ""finishes the job"" with one final blow of a mallet. All this because he felt that the plumber was taking advantage of him. 3) He drags a man behind his car because he doesn't give him the answer he wants concerning the matter of brown tap water.

The mother blows up a small grocery store after overhearing the owner and two customers criticizing Americans (mocking her). It seems apparent that all three people die in the explosion. Surely the writers could have come up with more creative ways that this couple could have handled the townspeople who disagreed with them, ways that would have been humorous and enjoyable. The fact that happy music plays while they commit these acts does not change the fact that they continue to seek revenge in the same manner as the mob. I felt little sympathy for them when the mob hunted them down at the end, and didn't feel much like applauding when each member of the family fought their way out. This movie had potential, but I find that this is simply not a likable family.",1406505600,,1744,4.518987341772152

6028839,3,B00FRILRL6,"There's one quote from this movie that I believe sums up all of the problems with it: ""Nostalgia stimulates the brain and helps it to fill in all of the missing parts"" (sorry if it's not 100% accurate, but that was the gist of it).  THE FAMILY is clearly reverent towards past gangster films, particularly those of the Scorsese/De Niro variety, but that's about all that it has.  The nostalgia is there, but the movie never develops a style of its own.  There are bits within it that work, like some scenes early on (which were spoiled in the trailer) which show how the family adjusts to their new environment, but there really isn't that much of a story.  Basically, this family moves to France under the Witness Protection Program because the dad snitched on the mafia, and while they're hiding the mafia tries to find them.  That's it.  What also doesn't work is that the film has an inconsistent tone.  One minute they're going for laughs, but the moment after that is violent and grim.  That kind of thing might work for Tarantino, but here a lot of the violence isn't played for laughs and just seems out of place.  There's also some attempts at drama that come off misplaced as well, like it was meant for some other film.  Overall, it's a mish-mash of ideas that never really cohere into a compelling story and aside from the lighter comedic bits and self-referencing, there isn't too much to recommend.  Bottom line, if you want a good mob movie, go watch something else.  This isn't the movie you're looking for.",1406160000,,1523,4.6

6028856,2,B00FRILRL6,"Wishing to avoid a thoroughly negative review, I'll concentrate on The Family's (few) positive attributes- it was reasonably well written and evenly paced, and the choice of actors was spot on.  It's especially nice to see Robert DeNiro under acting- giving his character Giovanni a wry, weary realism in the midst of a basically out-of control family.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a gem as the wisecracking female counterpart to DeNiro and Tommy Lee Jones basically reprises a the sardonic and straight laced Agent K from the Men in Black films.

However (and this is a big one) the rest of ""The Family"" is an uneven, unexplainable, unbelievable mess of a comedy/drama/thriller.  Director Besson would have been served well to eschew tightroping the thematic percentages and go with one genre or another. Is this a comedy? No.  A thriller? No. A classic Mafia tale? No.  So as a result the, scattershot thematic execution of the screenplay results in a meandering, inconsistent mess of a film where each of the family members has an opportunity to show how bad*ss they can be in not conforming with the French locals.

So instead of feeling the least bit of empathy for this witness protected American mob family we're convinced over and over that they operate on their own terms, regardless of location, and that the teenage (??) kids have synthesized their gangster father's violent tendencies into their own brand of sociopathic behavior.  The violent behavior by mom, daughter, son, and father are exaggerated and unnecessary and serve only to highlight an incredibly thin plot.

To make matters worse, Besson basically ignores the lovely French locations lending the film a bland and generically ""European"" feeling.  At the same time Besson has spares no opportunity to allow village inhabitants a chance to spew vapid anti-American insults which serve only to inflame DeNiro's violent clan even more.  In one especially hideous display of unprovoked violence the daughter (played by Dianna Agron) unleashes a viciously disproportionate tennis racket assault on a testosterone fueled oaf.

Were ""The Family"" not well acted it'd merit a half star.  As is, it's a formulaic and unconvincing mob movie with a xenophobic twist.",1403481600,,2222,5.155988857938719

I wouldnt say its hilarious, but its pretty funny. Michelle Pfeiffer is the best part of it. I love her thick Brooklyn accent. I just love her in everything. She has always been one of my favorite actresses. Its a pretty well written script and a good story.  You really end up liking and routing this family even though they are all kind of crooks.

I've always been a fan of De Niro and Pfeiffer both have played serious and comedy roles to perfection.  This is a dark comedy, so if you're looking for people slipping on banana peels you won't find them, but it is a very funny film with some dramatic elements. Being mobster themed, death and murder are always present, but we get a different persecutive in this film as it follows a mob Rat and his family as they struggle to blend into the witness protection program.

It plays like a drama, but then we are reminded often that this is mostly played for laughs. If you like Goodfellas, Married to the Mob or the Analyze This films, you will probably like The Family as much as I did. The Blu Ray looks great.",1402185600,2,797,4.306666666666667

6028884,3,B00FRILRL6,"Getting into the Witness Protection Program was the easy part, staying there is what's hard, in the latest Luc Besson comedy, The Family. With huge star power and a well known Director, this film had all the makings of a classic, unfortunately it has some major plot holes and lacks direction. One moment it seems like you're watching a comedy, that is about to break out, but then in the blink of an eye it's a drama, addressing difficult issues. The big tagline is that the Manzoni family is in hiding, and can't seem to behave themselves, but it's a lot more than that. The FBI has decided to place this Italian, Brooklyn mob family in the south of France. Even if their behavior wasn't outlandish, how is a Brooklyn family supposed to fit into a small village in France? They would naturally stand out like a sore thumb. Besides the obvious plot holes, other things are left out of the equation, the most glaring being the back story behind the families joining the program. While the story is all over the place, the film does feature a truly all-star cast and trust me, they help. If this wasn't De Niro, Jones, and Pheiffer, the film would have completely fallen apart and failed to hold my interest. The fact is that these are some the best actors in the world and they all do a tremendous job of keeping the audiences attention. There isn't much of a story here and it's nowhere near as funny as it was advertised to be, but big names and great performances fill seats in the theaters and that should have been this films hook. I'm not sure if the Family was a drama or some kind of dark comedy that I just didn't get, but aside from the terrific performances from an all-star cast, I was highly disappointed by this film.",1399939200,,1731,4.4637223974763405

6028886,1,B00FRILRL6,"Pass on this Stinkeroo

With a more competent director this might have been a marginally good movie.
It can never decide if it is a Drama, or a Comedy or a Commentary on Franco-American Relations.
 The plot appears to have been stolen from the Netflix series ""Lillehammer"" - except the Director of that series knows how to direct.

This is not a movie so much as a series of choppy and incredibly violent scenes. When the script runs out of ideas, they simply toss in a disturbingly violent interlude. The grocery patrons are rude - blow up the store. The plumber is rude - break both his legs and send him to the hospital.  A classmate is rude - beat him almost to death with a tennis racket.

This movie features one of the all around worst scripts of the decade.  It appears to have been written in French, and then translated into English by Googol Translate.

There is really only one reason to watch this movie -  Michelle Pfeiffer.  It made me realize how much I miss seeing her in films. She deserves a far better film than this one.",1399680000,,1041,4.408376963350785

That's not to say it isn't funny in some parts; it's actually quite hysterical, though I'd say it leans more toward drama, or dark comedy at the very least. None of that takes away from enjoying the film; just don't go into it expecting ""Analyze This.""

The cast is great, the story line not half bad, and the tension and drama are not lacking. The film pays homage to De Niro's past roles a few times, which made me laugh. The comedy isn't so much spoken as it is in the action, and the actors did very well in communicating it.

The story follows a mafia family in witness protection who move into their new place in France.
It was a very different story which I found refreshing.  It was funny, but has a lot more of a dark humor flavor to it (this is not a light comedy).  And the characters were quite intriguing and fun in their own messed up way.
There were some slow areas in the story (the movie night was one of them).  The actors were good, and believable.  It had some fun dialogue too.  And there were some really brilliant directing and editing done with few scenes.

Robert DeNiro plays a Mafioso, who turned and he and his family are now in the witness protection program. His wife, Michelle Pfeiffer is as crazed as he is, within the first hour in a new town, she has burned down the local grocery store. The two children have caused mayhem and misery in the local high school. Half of their friends are mutilated, or engulfed in their dangerous games. They have to move from town to town because dad keeps giving away their identity by killing or maiming someone. In this particular program 3 handlers accompany them from town to town. I won't give away the star who is the head handler, you will be as amazed as I that he would turn to this kind of misery.

Really, no redeeming value of any kind here. Move on, nothing to see.

Also it was too long for a mafia movie that focused more on the living life of what appeared to be a

It disappoints me that Hollywood would create such a hateful and false depiction of the French.  It would be totally and completely unacceptable to create a movie like this that was racist, depicting a certain race as rude and ugly, so what makes them think it's okay to create a prejudiced movie that depicts the French like this?  It's pretty disgusting.  I'm ashamed that our culture produces crap like this, and worse, we export it all over the world so everyone can see how ignorant we are.

Its existence caused no issues, yet the book seemed to be placed as a central character. The language was unnecessary and forced, and many of the scenes were simply a waste that could have been devoted to deepening our understanding of everyone's character or giving us the full history.

6028933,4,B00FRILRL6,"The Family isn't a fast paced film, in facts it's pretty slow paced for most part and could probably have been edited down from it's current nearly two hours in duration.  Or alternatively provided more occasions of the delving out justice to racists, jerks and would be rapists which were very enjoyable viewing.  Who hasn't been in a store while travelling (especially in France) where locals thinking you don't understand their language start making derogatory and racist remarks about yourself or your race.  Only to grovel like cowards when one of your group tells them off fluently in their own language.  Well Michelle Pfeiffer playing the mob mother, goes one step better than this at a supermarket.  As does Diana Agron when four boys drive her out of town and expect certain favours to bring her back.  In fact Agron surprisingly plays her probably best most meatiest role and furthest away from her Glee cheerleader yet.  I wasn't expecting much from her, but she was probably the best character of the whole mob family.  John D'Leo also doesn't do a bad job as the son, I have to admit I'd never heard of him before this film.  Robert De Niro as the mob father also delves out justice to a plumber who turns up late and tries to rip him off and others throughout the film.  That's pretty much what the film is, sort of a fantasy of what you'd like to do to those who do bad things to you but know you can't as in real life there are consequences.  Sort of like Michael Dougas' character in Falling Down.

Granted this film isn't believable at all.  Even if this family wasn't on the witness protection program, and know these actions would bring unwanted attention, no one could do them in real life and get away with it.  But that's what makes Family, fun viewing.  It did need though to lessen the in between the encounters with locals scenes as they were a bit boring.  Tommy Lee Jones' character and his colleagues didn't really add anything to the film other than slowing the pace so should have had a lot less air time.",1395446400,2,2037,4.554945054945055

6029004,5,B00FRILRL6,"Fun, fast and very pleasing, with just the right amount of violence and a great look at the life of a mob capo from the end, rather than the beginning. If they took Henry Hill from Goodfellas and Christopher from The Sopranos, wrapped those two characters together and told us what happened long after Henry Hill was relocated in Arizona, you would have this highly European flavored story.

If you like mob movies, this one is for you. Robert De Niro's acting, narration and his character is both highly believable and a good role for one of the greatest actors of my generation. Nice to see him in something with a dark humor rather than many of the roles he has taken lately in comedy.

Michelle Pfeiffer provides us with a nice counter point to De Niro and sizzles on the screen at 55 years old. She was quite a pleasure in this role and like Susan Sarandon and Sigourney Weaver, she goes on to prove that there is still a place in today's 20 something laden movie world for a mature actress.

The best of the writing is the great use of the universal adjective and an explanation from the son in ""The Family"" on why that, the F-bomb is not the word most know it as. But instead a summation of something much greater when used in the way screenwriters Luc Besson (director)  and Michael Caleo take it, use F$%* very wisely and with it like a spice--to season--this movie to great use.

Watch for a few Sopranos alumni and of course ""Big Pussy Bonpensiero"" amongst them.",1392854400,2,1473,4.4609665427509295

Idolizing fools like Spock(that 50's ""child-rearing advisor""), the Clintons, and a chuckle-head like Hussein Obama. Falling in love with abortion and homosexuality?!

It was a movie about mobsters trying to be like normal people in one of the snottiest villages in France under witness protection.

It has some dry/dark humorous parts, though not a laugh out loud type of movie, more of a smirk.  Also, overall, the movie is pretty good, with a nice and suspenseful plot, however (without giving away the ending) the ending of the movie is actually rather ridiculous and way too staged.

Classified as a comedy and this movie is not really. It has some dark humor, if you could call it that but the movie itself seems a bit confused, with several stories going different directions with each family member at the same time and not particularly in a cohesive manner either. The movie is slow and poorly written. When the movie gets to the best part, which is the action part of the ending, you have for the most part already lost interest. De Niro does the best he can in the role and if the writers and director would have concentrated on the main story, this would have been a great mafia action movie.

6029091,2,B00FRILRL6,"checked this movie out from the library because love Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfieffer, didn't know what it was about except vaguely about a mob family in Europe, hadn't seen the previews, thought it was a comedy. it's not a comedy, kind of a mob movie with comedic overtones. liked it sort of, hard not to in parts as story is presented as a new family setting up house in a new town, and they don't bother anyone unless they're bothered. that sounds okay, except it's not. I actually thought the kids' reactions were pretty fair given that they're teenagers and it made sense for the son to beat up the guy who viciously beat him. the parents, on the other hand, couldn't behave rationally and had short fuses in the face of ordinary rudeness from average citizens. both De Niro and Pfieffer's characters overreact violently to mistreatment by strangers, i.e., one or the other doesn't take kindly to snide remarks about Americans by local French citizens, don't appreciate being gouged by a plumber, want clean drinking water and are willing to beat people to get it, and when they're given the runaround have no problem showing their displeasure, which they do excessively violently. they never seem to count the cost or indeed suffer any significant consequence for their extremely antisocial behaviors. you heard the phrase, two wrongs don't make a right? well, that's this couple personified. in the real world, federal protection plan or no federal protection plan, the De Niro/Pfeiffer characters would be imprisoned for years for the behaviors they demonstrate in this film.  it makes sense that characters who were apparently top of the food chain in their business wouldn't suffer fools gladly, but they come across as psychopaths with no self-control. the problem is that the parents' behavior as individuals is so over the top you wonder how they can effectively parent or be any kind of role model to their kids. in the real world, when you read about people in the news who, for example, conceal carry, and who pull out a gun and shoot an unarmed person during an ordinary dispute, like someone stealing your parking spot, these film parents are that type of person. they dispense ""justice"" immediately as if they are god.  the writer tries to protect them by showing that they initiate no violence but merely respond to disrespect/discourtesy, but in a world where the nation suffers school/mall/theater shooting seemingly monthly, if not weekly, it'd be better if Hollywood would reconsider what it's putting out into the world about how film characters settle their disputes. not blaming Hollywood, just saying if the American flag can be put in films, and propaganda can run through films (as it does here, in my opinion, when De Niro's character says, paraphrasing, his federal agent is so straight he'd turn in his own mother if she cheated on her income tax statement), why not show interesting, nonviolent ways stars can solve disagreements. why not give something useful, along with entertainment. the kids were written better because they for the most part dealt violence to violence: the daughter wasn't about to be raped when she beat up the young man, though you could see where the situation was heading; her beat down of the young man would've played better had she run away and he chased and caught her: she was somewhat anticipatory with her smackdown (as the teen merely touched her shoulder with his finger), but at least she didn't shoot him. given the way the story was written, I was actually surprised, and relieved, when the daughter didn't have the young teacher she desired wacked or harmed when he rejected her. all the actors were good. totally unbelievable that the feds would put up with the shenanigans of this family, whether they were originally in the federal witness program or not, can't see the government continuing to protect them. what I did like was that the parents prepared their kids, as the kids clearly could take care of themselves. another unbelievable point: the family was made up of violent individuals, yet were kind and loving to one another. so, overall, I liked the film for the acting and touches of comedy, but couldn't totally enjoy it due to the parents lack of self-control and also unbelievable that the government would continue protecting them given the family's propensity to harm others.  2 and a half stars.",1391040000,,4392,4.908479138627187

You cannot go into this and think it is going to be a family friendly movie.  Are you kidding me, its a movie about a retired mob boss who has to be reassigned several times due to he and his family getting into ""trouble"".  I loved mob movies, and found this to be such a clever idea.  It was so good to see Robert DeNiro back to playing a mobster, I loved Michelle Pfieffer and the kids were great too!  Everything about this movie was so fun.  Don't go in thinking this is a comedy like Analyze This - just watch it and go on the ride.  It will not disappoint!",1390521600,,749,3.9731543624161074

It's as if the writers decided they weren't happy with the film half way through, changed gears and genre and then just quit  trying altogether.

I have trouble believing DeNiro would have taken the part if he had known how bad the film makers would bungle the job -- they owe him BIG for the mess they made of his appearance.",1390435200,4,465,4.043478260869565

6029147,1,B00FRILRL6,De Niro was in the only gangster movie that ever needed to be made and now he is in this.  It is a waste of the talents of every actor on screen as bad directing and editing probably killed a mediocre script.  This is a movie that was made so that the actors in it could get a paycheck.  It is just not good and it is not so terrible it is a different kind of good.  Horrible movie.  Thank god I did not see it in theaters.,1390089600,3,423,3.7613636363636362

6029149,5,B00FRILRL6,De Niro was prefect for this role.  Pfeiffer is well matched as De Niro's wife. Argon and D'Leo are equally good as their children.  The only actor that did a questionable job in their role was Tommy Lee Jones.  I thought that he acted like he was still in a MIB movie.  If you like black humor and don't mind violence this is definitely not a waste of 111 minutes.,1390089600,,365,4.171428571428572
6029150,2,B00FRILRL6,"First, this is NOT a comedy.  There are no laughs.  Whoever thought any of this was funny certainly has no experience in film, writing, or even reading.  There are a few scenes that make you smile or nod your head because you are happy to see someone get their deserved end.  That's as mirthful as it gets.

Now, it is really not a drama or thriller or action movie EITHER!  It flops somewhere in the middle, never deciding what it is.  There are scenes that look like they may develop into touching moments, then don't.  There are scenes that look like they may develop into teen organized crime plot lines, then don't.  And so on.

The fight in the end is worth watching, when the mob catches up to the family.  Some other scenes have French people who turn up their noses at Americans get what they deserve.  Other than that, the rest of the movie is really just a waiting game.  You wait to see what is happening, if anything interesting will develop.  Nothing does.

Not recommended unless you HAVE to see De Niro act or French jerks get killed once in a while.",1390089600,,1066,4.394871794871795

If you went into this movie expecting a comedy you really must have not payed attention. Now there were a few funny moments sprinkled in and the banter between DeNiro and Jones end up being some of the best parts of the movie. The story is ultimately about a high powered mob family adjusting to a small town, middle of nowhere life and being unable to do it. The violence isn't over the top or bloody but it's entertaining at the times it does show up. The biggest problem I had was the pacing, there were moments when it slowed down too much and it takes you out of the story too much. The end comes pretty swiftly and it's one you see coming from a mile away, but the few little quirks about it really doesn't take away from an overall enjoyable movie.",1389830400,,858,4.206060606060606

6029170,4,B00FRILRL6,"Written and directed by Luc Beeson, THE FAMILY (USA/France-2013) is a definite winner and Robert De Niro's best movie in a long time. It co-stars Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianna Agron and John D'Leo as his wife and kids, plus Tommy Lee Jones as the agent charged with protecting them.

After De Niro testifies against a mob boss, he and his family are targeted for assassination. They're placed in Witness Protection and bounced from location to place because one of them is always blowing their cover. Their latest home is a village in Normandy, France where the locals don't take kindly to rough-edged interlopers from Brooklyn.

The surprises come fast in this picture. It seems wife and teens are as prone to violence as De Niro is, maybe more so. The first day they're in town, Pfeiffer is insulted at a local grocer's and she firebombs the place! The daughter has her pencilbox stolen by another girl, and she beats the kid senseless with bare fists. The boy is attacked in school by a gang, so he organizes his own posse and they thrash the bullies. Meanwhile, De Niro, a shut-in who's trying to write his Mafia memoirs, hospitalizes anyone he feels has disrespected him. That includes the town's only plumber and the head of a local chemical plant that's turning the water supply brown.

The story really gets crazy when something the son wrote for a school newsletter makes its circuitous way, essentially as a piece of trash, right to the Mafia Don who's looking for De Niro, a 4,000 mile journey.

This one has a thrilling finale, a shootout where the family's outnumbered.
A comedy only in the darkest sense, THE FAMILY works best as the exaggerated domestic side of the gangster film genre.",1389744000,2,1697,4.761904761904762
6029171,3,B00FRILRL6,"Michelle Pfeiffer is looking old these days, but her kid more than makes up for it. Belle, her fictional daughter played by actress Dianna Agron, is alluring. In a Robert De Niro movie about Goodfellas-style mob crime, one of the most captivating moments is a sex scene in which shes getting dicked by her math teacher. Thats primarily because, while the basic concept; an American family trying to adjust to a new life in France via the FBIs Witness Protection Program; has potential, the quality of its genre-hopping plot is full of bullet holes.

6029172,1,B00FRILRL6,"But I could not finish the movie.  The violence was supposed to be funny, I think, but it seemed to be there just for its own sake and gave nothing to the plot.  It plays up a teenager (minor) having sex with their teacher as if it is a love story that doesn't work at all, with mom even supporting the daughter giving up her virginity to her teacher.  The plot was terrible and made no sense, and the acting was maybe one of the worst for Bobby, as it was if he phoned it in.  After an hour into the movie you have no real connection to any of the characters.  It was neither a comedy or a good mob movie and has DeNiro critiquing his own performance in Goodfellows.

DeNiro and Pfeiffer do a fair job, but Pfeiffers' Brooklyn accent seems a little off.  The two ""kick ass"" kids are surprisingly good in a few scenes which added to the film.

Nothing was too funny and I might have had one or two chuckles here and there, but in no way was it a comedy. I think the biggest reason for not liking this movie is sub-par character development.

You're only half there. The first hour and a half of the movie was a very poor story about the family adjusting to a move to France, with a combination of over-the-top violence and unconvincing look at DeNiro's character's life retrospective. It's only after 90 minutes that the bad guys show up, via an extremely cheesy plot device, and at that point we went to bed and never bothered to finish the film. it wouldn't be as bad if they gave you the right expectation in the trailer, but between disappointed expectations and a generally unimpressive film, I'd suggest don't waste your time.",1389657600,,759,4.547445255474453

Sadly though, it is not funny.  The humor is not witty, the views of France all but unseen as the family hides in
some remote town you really cannot see or enjoy.

Not at all like French Kiss, this movie does not fill you with any French flavors, and the supposed French actors
do their best to speak English with a strange and useless accent.  The French folk sound as bad(ridiculous) as
Steve Martin in The Pink Panther.  That part is nearly laughable, but only nearly.

It all just went too far and the movie would have been much better without going over-board the with profanity and killing.

If you're looking for silliness and over-the-top hijinks and pratfalls this will of course disappoint.  It's also extremely violent, but the violence again is part of the funny (DARK comedy, remember?). I would imagine that people who are giving the one-sentence one-star reviews just aren't able to understand it, honestly. Or else are just wanting this to be DeNiro reprising his Fokkers role or something. However, if dark comedy that you have to pay attention to is your thing, this will be a good watch.

Having said that, it's not the best film ever, and it's nowhere near DeNiro or Pfeiffer's best but they are enjoyable and fun to watch. Jones is brilliant, though, and the two kids are just absolutely superb.

The school bullies wind up getting a butt whooping (by the daughter in one case) and when the local French merchant makes derogatory remarks about Americans his store gets blown to hell and gone.

Violence, revenge are held up as virtues.  I am very sick of the latest couple of Luc Besson movies that are basically hyperviolent films devoid of story, character development, or anything of merit to justify spending your time with them (ex: wasabi, transporters, hitman basically anything from the 2000's up).  Luc Besson seems to have given up on making great interesting films with actual story like Nikita, Leon, Fifth Element and now makes violence content products.  These 'violence content products' are the particleboard--no-- the 'spicy hotdog of film', containing a ground up assortment of the following items in an easy to consume alimentary paste: hot girls with guns, high contrast explosions, creative and mildly comical gun v karate violance, sports car chases, dirty cop bangbang, italian criminals, and angry fixed faced jason statum

Hopefully not spoiling it for those who dare to watch something different, The Family has both subtle and slapstick humor.  It has drama and action, with an unusual - but satisfying - ending.  The acting was superb and the movie was well-made.

Aside from some violence, which isn't even as bad as some broadcast television shows, probably the primary reason for the ""R"" rating is the generous use of the ""F"" word.  However, I didn't find it offensive in the context of the movie.  And no one in my house goes around saying that word, either.

6029308,2,B00FRILRL6,"This is a movie that hasn't decided what it wants to be when it grows up yet, a comedy with serious moments, or a drama with funny moments. As a result it's neither. The jokes come and go, but with rare exceptions, you're not laughing. Later the film turns too serious, then tries to end as if serious never happened. All frequently scored with whimsical sitcom music, making you wonder if the composers thought they were writing for a different film. The results are disastrous in terms of the overall experience, because you walk out (or put the disc back in its rental case) neither touched nor amused. Just wanting your money back.

To be fair, it has its moments (and they're not the ones in the trailer, which was better than the film). One brief laugh-out-loud scene puts De Niro and Tommy Lee Jones together in a theater, with De Niro doing his charming gangster and Jones his stone-faced cop, and it's so good. For once in this film everything works. Hopefully another director will cast these guys together again, but in a good film. This is not that film. There is some great suspense at the end, just before the story jumps the shark, but that's after a very slow second act. One strange continuity issue: Michelle Pfeiffer crawls across a room to rescue another character, but takes so long you wonder if she crawled around the house first. More significantly, and I am being careful to avoid spoilers, this film breaks an unwritten rule about what works and doesn't in dark comedies. Characters may die in a comedy but they must either be bystanders, or their death must mean something and be mourned before we can laugh again. You can't just throw significant characters away.

The 'kids' had interesting roles but not all that believable - not enough to make me want to look up their real names or see them in other roles.

They clash with locals (surprise!) but, somehow, beating people to a pulp, murdering others and firebombing buildings hardly raises an eyebrow.  A billion to one shot does tip their hand. That's not a spoiler because you'll see it marching down Main Street from five miles away.

The clever catchphrase of the movie is ""F***!"". You'll use it when you realize you burned almost two hours on this turkey.",1388448000,,820,5.150375939849624

She plays the role of the mobsters wife perfectly, including the NY/North Jersey accent. Tommy Lee Jones has a smaller but important role and he plays it great. The daughter, played by Dianna Agron, is a bit too much, especially toward the end. Agron is a good actress but her character is not well written and one particular decision toward the end of the film is out of character. This is a dark comedy and you should expect some laughs but also some violence, which actually plays well.

Of course, the family's actions catch up to them in the movie's climax, and it is fun to watch the action-packed way the family handles whatever life throws at them.

Dianna Agron is literally luminous as their daughter (yes she is a little mature to be playing a teen but more than a little suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy this wonderful fable). John D'Leo is outstanding as their son.  It also helps if your are a fan of New Jersey mobster comedy ( see Analyze This.)

6029386,4,B00FRILRL6,"Though THE FAMILY is listed as a comedy/crime/thriller that category is as misaligned as any in trying to describe this very fast moving superbly acted and directed film from Luc Beeson (The Taken series The Transporter series, The Fifth Element, the Taxi series, L&eacute;on: The Professional, La Femme Nikita etc). Adapted from Tonino Benacquista's novel by both Beeson and Michael Caleo this cinematic outing blends American gangsters, a witness protection gangster's family with out of country FBI agents and places the action in Normandy, France and the result is an at times brutal tale while at other times an examination of a family made dysfunctional by the father's past, with a lot of secondary plots that bring increased interest to the plot.

The Manzoni family (father Giovanni - Robert DeNiro, mother Maggie - Michelle Pfeiffer, daughter Belle - Dianna Agron, and son Warren - John D'Leo) is relocated to a sleepy town in Normandy, France under the witness protection program after snitching on the mob. Despite the best efforts of CIA Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) to keep them in line, Manzoni and his wife and their children can't help but revert to old habits and blow their cover by handling their problems the ""family"" way, enabling their former mafia cronies to track them down. Each member of this strangely close and devoted family takes punishment of outside harassing victims into their own hands, a sweet love affair ensues with Belle and her math coach, and an innocent clipping made for the school newspaper by Warren leads to the Mafia attempt to destroy the family once and for all.  Yes there are funny moments in the smart script, but this is more a drama than a comedy - a film noir. The acting by DeNiro, Pfeiffer, Agron and D'Leo (a real discovery!) is first class. A lot of killing goes on, but the film is so well directed and acted that it is a fine evening's entertainment. Grady Harp, December 13",1388016000,7,1942,4.86404833836858

The rest of it is a lot of gratuitous violence that is supposed to be funny, but is not. DeNiro is good (as always) but in a very trite role, and Tommy Lee Jones is just a repeat of his typical grouchy grumbling old-man role, not too charming or entertaining. Movies which depend on stabbings and machine gun spray sequences should rethink their basis for creation.

(Michele Pfeiffer still looks good!)

His quantity is increasing but the quality has suffered.  Tommy Lee Jones is looking very old and sounding older.  It seems we can't get enough of mob films.

Tommy Lee Jones was great as the officer in charge of relocation of De Niiros family (great attitude). Pheiffer playing with the NY city accent was perfect. The kids just rolled with the part and fit great with the cast.

Not to mention the stereotypical hardass US Marshall played by none other than Hollywood's de facto US Marshall, Tommy Lee Jones (Fugitive, US Marshalls, etc.).

The cast makes the movie work and you really get the family vibe from them! The movie was engaging and kept me wondering what would come next in the scheme of things. There is violence in the movie, so it is not a family-friendly movie (at least not for young audiences), but if you are a fan of mafia movies and love to see DeNiro in a mafia movie, this will satisfy!
