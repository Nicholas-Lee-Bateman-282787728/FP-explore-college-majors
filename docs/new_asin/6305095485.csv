Let's see, they got Moses' name right, they got Ramses II's name right.....that's about it.  Not recommended for anyone who is interested in Biblical accuracy.  Cecil B. DeMille did a far better job.",1289174400,,285,4.68
8148244,1,6305095485,"While it would be lovely if the people in real life made some of the choices made in this movie, they did not.  This movie had so many misinterpretations that my children and I lost count.  The makers of this film took far more license than necessary with this story - and made a different story from the Bible account.  The pharaoh's grandson/Moses' brother by adoption ends up joining Moses (instead of Moses' natural brother), the burning bush's repeated use may as well have been a crystal ball in this ""adaptation"", and the miracles differed from the historical account.  God's consequences for people's sins are not treated with the respect they deserve.  This movie was a waste of time and one we will be tossing in the trash (not giving away or selling in a garage sale, even!)  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME on this movie.",1030233600,,837,4.621621621621622
