Impeccable performances, stellar direction and cinematography. Everyone in this production is at the top of their game. Happy viewiing~*",1495238400,,281,5.558139534883721
942644,3,6304981643,"Good for one viewing; poor Annette and her bony form... I was embarrassed for her, but that was sex appeal back then. I honestly don't know what all the hub-bub was about for this movie. Appears put together by people who don't actually have grown children. John Cusack was great, Anjelica Huston is the same person she is in most movies, plus a great blonde dye job.

The interplay between the Cusack character and his mother, Lily (Huston) is believable and I can easily understand the tension. Annette Benning does a super job of playing her character, and gets what she wants using what she hasand she really does have it: Woo, Annette. The ending is right in form with the characters, and Lily drives off into the LA night leaving me wonder what she'll put together, and being pretty confident that she'll survive, and in some sense thrive.",1488153600,,536,4.836956521739131

942701,1,6304981643,"The best thing about this movie is Elmer Bernsteins score. Such music deserves a better movie. Product placement is obvious as the only beer anyone drinks in this movie is Miller High Life.

 Lilly (Angelica Huston) is the incestuous mother of Roy (John Cusack). She despises his girlfriend Myra (Annette Bening) who, in return, despises her. They are all grifters but Cusack is thinking about quitting. His mother thinks this is fine but Myra needs him for one of her schemes. There are no subtitles of any language on the blu ray.

SPOILER ALERT. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER BECAUSE IM GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE ENDING. SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT. OKAY, YOUVE BEEN WARNED.

 Just before Lilly kills Myra, we see her attaching a silencer to her gun. When she fires the gun, the sound is loud. In real life, everyone in the motel would have heard the gun but not in the movie. Why did Myra attach the silencer to her gun and then remove it? This question is never answered. Lilly drives away in Myras car leaving a large sum of money in her car. In real life, a veteran grifter would not have been so stupid. After Lilly accidentally kills her son, she drives away in his car. Since the face of Myra has been destroyed by a bullet, the authorities think she is Lilly and that Lilly is dead by suicide. No one else knows that Myra is dead so Lilly is safer in Myras car. Its only a matter of time before the authorities discover the body of Lillys son. The authorities will not be looking for the killer of Myra but they will be looking for the killer of Lillys son. So if you're looking for logic, avoid this movie.",1474243200,,1610,4.407407407407407

I do believe this could be a good movie with a better script and more approriate actors. Annette Bening is probably the best in this movie, John Cusack gets on my nerves in this as well as Anjelica Huston. I like most of their movies but for me in this film, not they weren't good.

Roy is a petty cheat, purely a retail scammer.  His mother (Huston) is tough as nails, a long-term survivor working for bookies in the mob.  Then there is Myra, a sleazy psychopath with big ambitions, played to perfection by Bening.  The film keeps you guessing right to the end and is chock full of unexpected twists.  While there are some plot holes, it holds up well as solid entertainment.  We had a great evening watching it, though will probably not want to re-watch it much.

942857,3,6304981643,"A four star movie with a two star bluray transfer.  I last saw this on VHS and this bluray appears to be the same quality. Super grainy, lots of flecks, and the black in particular looks bad. With no bonus features, this typifies one of the laziest blurays I have seen in a long time.  The movie itself is a little dated now, the music in particular sometimes leaves a lot to be desired. Also quickly got tired of Annette Bening's character running around naked all the time for no real plot reason.  However, overall three pretty good performances and somewhat of a unique movie. Because of Annette's character it almost has a black comedy feel at some points, certainly not the ""erotic thriller"" Rolling Stone reviewed it as.

942859,3,6304981643,"I originally saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and I recall it as being more interesting than it was on my recent viewing. John Cusack is great, as usual, but the storyline is ploddingly slow at first and really never gets into high gear. I compare the grifting aspect to that shown in several David Mamet films (like the Spanish Prisoner, a brilliant movie) and it is just not as interesting or as insightful--Mamet takes you into the con and he lets you see how the cons unravel. Stephen Frears, the director of Grifters, does not; instead he tends to use the cons as a backdrop to a kind of weird mother/son drama. While I found the movie tolerable to watch a second time and Cusack is a joy to watch, I just didn't think the script held up. I'll watch it again though, primarily for some good acting.",1446249600,,823,4.35064935064935

942865,4,6304981643,"A small flaw in this stylish Jim Thompson story. Lily kills Roy for the money hidden behind his clown pictures.

But what about the money stashed in the trunk of her car which she skimmed off Bobo Justus over the years?

She doesn't really need Roy's money.",1443139200,,257,4.446808510638298
942906,1,6304981643,"Awful... So terrible  it taints the book it's  authof and the honorable profession of grifting.  Easily the worst adaptation of a Thompson novel.  I never for one second found any of the characters to be believable other than the  character actor who played Bobo.  Angelica

Houston gives an even worse performance than when she gave her testimony in the rape trial of Roman Polanski.  Annette Benning tries to channel  Gloria  Graham but instead turns out a performance that reaches the dramatic levels  of an SNL skit.

John Cusick possibly delivers the worst performance I have ever seen in any major motion picture  but to his defense he may have possibly been the most miscast actor in any major motion picture.

 Also the  bit part of Jeremy  Piven (who in fact  made a living off of being John Q Zack's boyfriend for nearly his entire career till landing his role of the douche agent in that equally douchey show entourage) made me  hate the film even more. J-Pivs was even a bald dork back then...a baby fat bald dork.

 The fact that Scorsese produced  this complete mess should  tarnish  his legacy, however I think  most have forgotten about this piece of crap...much like After Hours.

 In conclusion Annette Benning Angelica Houston and John Q Zack are all terrible actors especially John Q Zack...he may be an acting robot or an all star on the casting couch?",1443139200,7,1373,4.731914893617021

942913,4,6304981643,"In most films about ""grifters"", or ""con artists"", they are almost always the ones the audiences root for, such as the lovable characters in ""The Sting"", Gondorff and Hooker (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) whose only marks are those who deserve it. In reality, grifters mark anyone they think they can take. And the more the mark has, the more the grifter thinks he or she can take from them. A con artist (aka confidence man or woman) uses camaraderie and deception to convince a potential victim to willfully give them money. In the best con games, the mark doesn't realize he or she has been ""taken"".

Roy Dillon (John Cusack) is a small-con grifter who was taught by an older con artist and magician. He perpetrates small-time tricks, like switching bills at bars, and getting in with strangers to play rigged games of chance. But he's never enacted bigger cons. His mother Lilly Dillion is also a grifter who works for the mobs which own many of horse racing tracks in California. She's paid to bet on long shots to decrease the pay offs in case the long shot wins, using the mob's own money, even though the track itself doesn't know the mob is actually paying into its own betting pool. For example, if a horse had 50-1 odds to win, and Lilly adds money into the betting pool making the odds 40-1, if the horse wins, the mob only has to pay off $40 to every $1 bet instead of $50. But there's a small hitch. Lilly is skimming off the top, betting less money than the mob has given her, and she hides the extra in the trunk of her car.

The wild card is a young female grifter name of Myra Langtry (Annette Bening) who was once in a big con game with a man name of Cole (J.T. Walsh). At the film's beginning we learn Roy is going with Myra, but he's not sure about her, and he doesn't know she's a grifter. After Roy unsuccessfully pulls one of his bate and switch the bills games on the wrong bartender which lands him a slug into the stomach, Lilly and Myra meet at hospital. From the get-go we know that Lilly and Myra are adversaries, both vying for the affections of Roy. Eventually, Roy and Myra leave on a road trip.

During the trip, Myra recounts her days with Cole and how they swindled Texas millionaires out of thousands in cash. They set up a phony office when oil prices were down and convinced Texas magnates to invest thousands of dollars into a scheme. Cole and Myra would convince the mark they could defraud the stock or bonds market by placing orders depending upon a shift in the market, such as a stock, bond or currency, and then cash in on the profits. The trick was a 7-second delay in which if there was a significant move of a stock and/or commodity up or down on the Tokyo exchange, they could either buy or sell before the information reached New York. When the mark brought the money, and all that was needed was to make the actual transaction, a phony scenario was presented to the mark involving authorities, and the mark and his money would soon part company.

But Roy has never tried anything so big before. And his mother Lilly wants Roy out of the con game, before he becomes like her, a loser who has sold her soul to the mob. She is physically punished by one of the mobsters for missing one of the high-stakes races when she takes Roy to hospital, and as luck would have it, one of the long-shots wins, forcing the mob to pay 70-1 odds. We know that this is a tug of war between these two women, the sexy upstart grifter Myra and the lonely loser old grifter Lilly.

An excellent film which probably more accurately portrays the cut-throat world of con artists. In reality, some con artists are playing deadly games, not like the characters portrayed in ""The Sting"", ""The Film-Flam Man"" and ""House of Games"". A French nobleman who had invested with Bernie Madoff committed suicide when the fraud was revealed, and others have been killed by con artists. The world of Roy, Lilly and Myra portrays a much deadlier world. While a great and compelling film, I would have liked Myra and Roy to engage the ""big con"" which in the end they avoid.",1435449600,,4083,4.424202127659575

943044,3,6304981643,"The three stars are for the BLU-RAYs only, as I would probably give the film 4. See it, if you haven't. It's good.

Anyway, I purchased this movie on Blu-ray back in May 2013. It was dirt cheap, but unfortunately was also being released by Echo Bridge Entertainment. Anybody familiar with this company knows that they seldom put any effort into their releases and seem to live by ""you get what you pay for."" Surprisingly, the Blu-ray wasn't half bad, and while not perfect, the transfer was miles above the quality of the DVD.

Strangely, this version also went out of print rather quickly, as did several other cheap releases by Echo Bridge, and it was selling for a lot of money at one point through sites like Ebay and second-hand vendors here on Amazon.

Almost two years later, this movie was now re-released by Lionsgate, and since I could not find any information on it beforehand, I decided to take a chance on getting it to see if they did a better job on the transfer. Once again, it was dirt cheap, so it wasn't too high of a risk.

Right off the bat, I will tell you that the transfers are EXACTLY the same. So, if you own the first release, there is no need whatsoever to upgrade, thinking they did some new painstaking transfer this go around.

But, strangely, the lesser liked company of Echo Bridge released a better disc, as the new release does NOT have the three extra features from their previous release, which includes ""The Making of The Grifters"" (16:24), ""The Jim Thompson Story"" (7:59) and the director's commentary by Stephen Frears.

The new release has NO special features whatsoever (including a commentary), as its only option off the menu is to ""Play Feature"".

So, it's basically a release for the people who missed it the first time around, but not a double dip improvement for the people who already got it.

If you don't have it, it is definitely worth picking up, especially at the low price. Also, for anybody interested in a digital copy of the movie, the new release does offer that as well.

One more thing, Amazon doesn't seem to have a date for this yet, but it IS at most Best Buys right now for $7.99.",1424390400,8,2145,4.521963824289406

I don't understand a company (Echo Bridge) policy that would take a product off the market after only a year's release.  This is a brilliant film with brilliant performances. Almost an embarrassment of acting riches compared to most current film  performances, and a script up there with CHINATOWN.  It should have been lovingly restored, or cleaned up and put out by a company like Criterion Collection. So now if you want this film on Blu-Ray (like me) and did not buy it within this last year (and I did not as some of the Blu-Ray magazine reviews were not great) you pay a lot of money to get it.  It is only a negligible upgrade over the DVD edition.

All three put in awesome performances, even if they are a little stilted at times. The supporting cast is equally impressive. Starting out with a few small time grabs that eventually become a big deal, the good and the really bad interact, each trying to get what they want, making sacrifices of loyalty and trust along the way. After all, as the saying goes, ""If they're not stealing a little, they're stealing a lot."" It all ends in tears, as it must. Jim Thompson's books are not known for happy endings.

""The Grifters"" has a good blu-ray picture, not great, but more than adequate for sure.  Decent colors, but it's not incredibly sharp. The audio is good, not great, and not any louder than average.

I was shocked that this has NO subtitles, that's right, not even English.  If it's not loud enough for you, you're out of luck (it's of average volume).

The movie is one that starts out interestingly enough and gets weaker and weaker the deeper in you go.  How Cusack ever became a ""leading man"" is beyond me, he'll look like a kid when he's 80, and he's no lover, manly man, detective-type, or tough guy. He's an Average Joe, but a wimpy one in build and manner, who constantly gets starring roles, I don't know why.

Angelica Houston irritated me frequently in this film the way she pronounced ""Los Angeleeees.""  What in hell was that?  She did it 3-4 times, every time she referred to that city.  Annette Bening seemed to over-act, also was irritating.

I was underwhelmed with this film, which applies to every Cusack film I've ever seen.  Why I've viewed so many of his, I don't know.

This movie is some sort of classic?  Puh-lease.  See HOUSE OF GAMES and SHADE for two extremely clever films of this genre.  Of the two, I can view SHADE more often.  THE GRIFTERS, for story/script/acting, doesn't compare, nor does it compare to either of these two as to the scams and tricks we get to see.

Don't even mention THE STING and PAPER MOON.  Again, both of these classics are FAR better than THE GRIFTERS.

Angelica Houston irritated me frequently in this film the way she pronounced ""Los Angeleeees.""  What in hell was that?  She did it 3-4 times, every time she referred to that city.  Annette Bening seemed to over-act, also was irritating.

I was underwhelmed with this film, which applies to every Cusack film I've ever seen.  Why I've viewed so many of his, I don't know.

This movie is some sort of classic?  Puh-lease.  See HOUSE OF GAMES and SHADE for two extremely clever films of this genre.  Of the two, I can view SHADE more often.  THE GRIFTERS, for story/script/acting, doesn't compare, nor does it compare to either of these two as to the scams and tricks we get to see.

Don't even mention THE STING and PAPER MOON.  Again, both of these classics are FAR better than THE GRIFTERS.

THE GRIFTERS was worth one viewing.",1378944000,2,1666,4.5675675675675675

Or perhaps the mother-son duo will at some point sort out their relationship (no, that doesn't happen either). All that happens is that we learn about three criminals who are not happy with their lot in life and then two of them die. This does not make for an interesting plot.

Cusack's performance is very good, given the dialog he has to work with. Huston is overacting (maybe not her fault, maybe that's how the director wanted it..who knows). Bening on the other hand is completely unconvincing, and just like the movie as a whole rather forgettable.",1378080000,,767,4.639705882352941

943630,4,6304981643,"British director Stephen Frears' ""The Grifters"" is proof positive that a film noir can be set outdoors in dazzling Southern California sunshine as well as indoors in seedy bars and hotels. It can feature not one but two femmes fatales. If the genre requires one, two will absolutely guarantee the demise of one not-as-bright-as-he-thinks-he-is anti-hero. John Cusack's Roy Dillon is the victim of his own greed and small time cheats. His fellow grifters (con artists) are his beautiful and manipulative mother, Lilly (Anjelica Huston),who gave birth to him at the age of 14 and his beautiful and manipulative girl friend, Myra (Annette Bening),who gives a fresh definition to the term to ""use sex as a weapon"". A split screen early in the film brackets Roy with the two women, all three of them sporting fashionable sunglasses and self satisfied smiles.
The recipient of four Oscar nominations for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director, ""The Grifters"" is, in my estimation, one of the cream of the 1990 cinematic crop, along with ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", The Godfather Part III"", Goodfellas"" and ""Reversal of Fortune"".
Prior to this lethal tragicomedy, Frears' best work had included ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" (1985) and ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988). Sexual politics would appear to be one of the director's dominant themes: the gay romance between a delinquent young British punk and a young Pakistani aspiring entrepreneur (""Laundrette"") and the middle-aged French aristocrats who are former lovers and present despoilers of the young (""Liaisons""). Here the sexual politics revolve around stolen money and the desire to obtain it by any means necessary, including violence, seduction and even a whiff of incest.
""The Grifters"" finds Anjelica Huston in the middle of the most successful and accomplished portion of her career. After winning her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in her father John Huston's ""Prizzi's Honor"" (1985), she gave a luminous performance in his final film, ""The Dead""(1987) and another in ""Enemies: A Love Story"" (1989), which earned her a second Best Supporting Actress nomination. The following year, she scored a double triumph with ""The Grifters"" and ""The Witches"". The former outrageous and courageous performance bought her her only Best Actress nomination. Her born to play it role of Morticia Addams would follow.
Wielding white blonde hair that would do Marilyn Monroe proud, she negotiates her environment of racetracks, saloons and motels in high heels and mini-skirted suits. Lilly lives dangerously, skimming money from her brutal gambler boss ( a terrifying because quiet performance by Pat Hingle) and trying to keep it hidden until she can escape into hiding. Facing the loss of her stash due to the treachery of her son's girlfriend, whom she loathes and by whom she is loathed in return, Lilly will even try to seduce her son with a denial of her maternity. As befitting a crime film, things don't end well.
Writing, directing, scoring (jaunty and ominous, courtesy of Elmer Bernstein) and especially acting are the hallmarks of excellence in ""The Grifters"". The Blu-ray disc, however, leaves a bit to be desired. Darkened scenes, especially those shot in hallways, are quite grainy. The disc lacks a theatrical trailer and subtitles; the soundtrack is a dated 2.0 stereo rendition. Still, given its modest Amazon price, ""The Grifters"", in its Blu-ray guise, is worth purchasing at about half the cost of a current movie ticket.",1376956800,,3512,5.250889679715303

943901,5,6304981643,"THE GRIFTERS is quite simply brilliant.  The basic premise is straightforward: small-time conperson Roy (John Cusack) tries to prosper while trying to sustain his relationships with mother Lily (Anjelica Huston) and girlfriend Myra (Annette Bening).  However the love-triangle gets complicated when Lily and Myra try to rival one another for Roy's affections, leading to death and destruction.  But what makes this film so brilliant is its precise delineation of the conperson's life: all three protagonists are engaged in the same trade.  Sometimes they are outstandingly successful; for the most part, however, they lead hand-to-mouth existences, either wondering about where their next buck will come from, or working for sadistic gangland bosses such as Bobo Justus (Pat Hingle).  Director Stephen Frears vividly captures the seedy ambiance in which the three protagonists operate - dilapidated motels, racetracks, darkly lit rooms and the inevitable automobiles.  One of the film's main subplots concentrates on the characters' search for personal stability: Lily tries to be a mother to Roy, while Myra acts as a surrogate mother. This produces one of the film's most fascinating plot-twists.

A young and sexy Annette Bening also shines in a story with no direction. There is not much to this story. The lives of three losers collide in a manner than can only end in disaster. John Cusak is Roy Dillon - whose cons seem to be on the lighter side. Enter Annette Bening as his sexy and devious girlfriend Myra and there is a glimmer of hope for an interesting story. Unfortunately, everything in THE GRIFTERS is predictable and rather dull with lots of scenes at the racetrack. All three main characters are unsavory and only Roy seems to have enough of a heart to have some chance for redemption.
The road to destruction begins once Lilly and Myra meet. Roy is caught in the middle of a battle between his mother and girlfriend. Who is conning whom?
Angelica is simply smashing as a woman who has known nothing in life but crime and heartache. She taught her son the rules of the con game and now she is back in his life.
Unfortunately, THE GRIFTERS is rather slow moving and uneventful. Angelic and Annette help to make the film somewhat watchable. The twists and surprises don't come to the end.

944054,4,6304981643,"I wonder if Scorsesce wanted to give ""the ladies"" a leg up here...with Goodfellas (also 1990) and so many before, the spotlight really falls on the dominant males. Here, Angela Huston and Annette Bening, as ""old school"" con artists, run the joint and John Cusack is the ""student"", of sorts.

Cusack may be the brightest and least immoral, but he, and other vulnerable guys, like Bening's landlord and jeweler, can't resist the sensuality she exudes (her skin tight dresses don't hurt, either). The equally sensuous Huston, seems to be able to control Cusack only, in a steaming hot hotel room scene, pupils in dilation and hearts in palpitation, as she pulls out the stops in trying to make off with his stash...but if he's really...her...son? See for yourself.

She tries to seduce her ""boss"", who appears unseducable, even following an incredibly erotic scene in which he degrades her verbally and physically, over a relatively tiny breach of trust.

Once I could make heads or tails of what's happening, I got very engrossed in the storytelling. A fantastic script (which could have been written for any ""real"" film noir of the '40s), really involves the viewer.

I found that Bening's character was a tad over the top...the community college dropout able to con Oil Barons? With that brain why not run for the Senate and really clean up?",1325203200,,1341,4.894273127753304

Right.  Because they are grifters.  Right.  This is the laziest example of moral calumny you will  find in a movie.

The actors in this odyssey speak in physical grammar and the slick, witty and hard boiled dialog is largely muzak.  Anjelica Houston's Lilly postures in brash suits like a school girl far beyond her years - even though she seen a few already.  That's not to say Lilly doesn't utter a few daggers now and then - ""My son will be all right, if not I'll have you killed.""

Cusack's Roy barely utters every meager syllable while clenching his gut with a half open stare.  Roy sells self confidence and wants to be a real con, but never listens enough to mom, even though she wrote the book.  Roy frequently brushes with dangers and somehow mom is always there to save his life.  ""Second time I gave it to you.""  Then there is Annette Bennign's Myra, Roy's giggle ""Friend,"" trotting around like a bobble head fixture on a taxi dashboard with clip on earrings but garnering enough attention to slice you from behind for a dollar. You can well imagine she is a lot of people's friend.  Just ask the landlord.

Each of these performers puts in what well may be the best performance of their careers.  Director Stephen Frears uses a restrained hand on Donald E. Westlake's literal script and lets the actors play this out on their own.

So greed is good?  Maybe for Myra.  Ultimately The Grifters is about survival and the illusion of getting something for nothing.  But even somewhere inside Roy knows not everything is a free ride, ""Lilly, I guess I owe you my life.""

middle or ending. Its goal is to underline a very specialized,
and specific behavior carried out by a limited number of people, of
small time scams, also known as grifting. Perhaps at the time
the movie was released, pop culture found this type of theme somewhat
hip and cool in a flic, but in any event, the strong aspect of this movie,
are the 3 main actors, who very skillfully give out an aura of
semi-seriousness, in a movie that itself, deals with a theme that
normally could be taken very literally, seriously and dramatically.

It also has many dream-like elements, which is difficult to do,
unless the story is written and filmed by experienced pro's, which
was the case in this movie.

Finally, Anjelica Huston, John Cusack and Annette Benning all
visibly sport a lot of charisma, pleasure and natural excitement
in playing their roles, and clearly, the audience will appreciate
that aspect, as well, since the comedy side to the film is also
appreciated by a lot of viewers.",1270166400,,1045,4.8

His mother Lilly Dillon works in La Jolla for the powerful bookmaker Bobo Justus, who owns the Justus Amusement Company in Baltimore, placing bets to change the odds at the track but also stealing some money for her that she stashes in her Cadillac. When Lilly comes to Los Angeles to a horse race, she pays a visit to Roy after eight years without seeing each other, and she finds that he has an internal hemorrhage and sends him to the hospital, saving his life. When the experienced Lilly sees Roy's girlfriend, the slut and con artist Myra Langtry, she immediately finds that Myra is a roper. But the grieved Roy does not pay attention to his absent mother and decides to travel with Myra to La Jolla to spend a couple of days resting. Myra sooner finds that Roy lives of short-con grift and proposes him a great plan to rope tycoons; further she unravels Lilly's scheme with Bobo's money. When Roy turns Myra and her offer down, the greedy women set in motion a betrayal that brings tragic consequences to each player. ""The Grifters"" sees John Cusack play Roy Dillon, a grifter whose loyalties are split between his con-artist girlfriend (Annette Bening) and his estranged mother (Anjelica Huston) in a tangled web of deceit with bloody consequences.

Stephen Frears's adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel twists our discomfort with the primal relationship of mother, son and girlfriend.  The latter two played by John Cusack and Angelica Huston.

The central conceit here is suggests that a life devoted to running the con corrupts the most basic of relationships and values.  Well, duh.  The world of the story seen through the eyes of the con-artists and is filled with either ""grifters"" or ""squares.""

944178,5,6304981643,"The first time I saw `The Grifters' I was a little underwhelmed.  I didn't quite understand what all the fuss was about.  At that point I had yet to really understand the concept behind a crime-noir and so the acting and the dialog just didn't sit right with me.  Years later I saw this film yet again, and my reaction was very different.  `The Grifters' brilliantly captures the spirit of the noir and delivers a very solid film that stays true to its roots with style and flare and, when taken for what it is, serves as a very exciting and entertaining ride.

`The Grifters' tells the story of three con-artists (or `grifters') and their relationship to one another.  Roy Dillon makes his money playing small cons on unsuspecting innocents like bartenders and sailors.  His mother Lilly plays a different kind of con, working for big time bookie Bobo by hedging for him at the race track.  Roy's girlfriend Myra uses her body and magnetism to con her way out of anything she can.  The three of them grift in their own way yet soon they will find that their choice of lifestyle and means of living is going to catch up with them.

The script is expertly written, adding layers of mystery and intrigue to these characters and their predicament.  The script is actually the one facet of the film that I disliked the first time I saw it yet adored the second time.  My taste has obviously matured (when I first saw this film I was roughly twelve or so) within the eleven year time gap between sittings and so I am able to appreciate the art that went into this film.  Director Steven Frears masterfully crafted this picture, allowing the style of the film to permeate each scene and drawing out of his entire cast performances that only elevate the material and compliment the films overall presence.

There are three main actors at play here, all of which do a stand up job with the material.  John Cusack delivers one of his finest performances as Roy Dillon.  His performance never really garnered much attention (his two lady co-stars do steal his thunder here) but he does deserve to be recognized.  He really understood the concept behind the film and you could feel a connection between him and his character.  He's not as polished an actor as Anjelica Huston, so she dominated him with ease when they shared the screen, but there is no denying that he grasped the style of the film he was in and delivered a commendable performance.  Anjelica Huston is one of those actresses that acts from her fingertips down to her toes.  There is one scene in particular, when Lilly is in her hotel room on the phone with Roy and she sits on her bed with on leg bent and cocked up on the mattress and just her position breathed through the screen and confirmed that Huston was fully amerced in this character.  She became Lilly Dillon inside and out.  As wonderful as Huston is, Bening is better.  I have complained about Annette before to friends, calling her out on her tendency to overact, as if she feels that is the only way to act.  This performance used her tendency to create a character that felt so real and so effortless I just couldn't help but find myself glued to her every movement.  I just love the way that Myra is lighthearted and carefree one minute, her voice at a shrill and her head bopping from side to side, and then she shifts her countenance and her voice deepens a tad and her eyes sharpen and you know that she is conning you but you can't help but fall for it every time.

As far as supporting actors go, the list begins and ends with Pat Hingle.  Hingle plays Lilly's boss Bobo Justus and his performance, while limited, is enormously captivating.  His confrontation with Lilly is flawlessly acted with a realistic mixture of ruthless bravado and genuine interest.

`The Grifters' takes three very interested characters and fleshes them out for us, and while it leaves questions unanswered we feel completed when the film ends.  Those unanswered questions may seem like a big deal at first (one of the reasons I disliked the film the first time) but you realize when you take a step back that those questions we're left with only help us appreciate the finished product all the more.  This film is oozing with mystery and that helps us remember it well and desire to revisit it, if only to have a chance at answering some of those questions.",1213920000,3,4364,4.563543003851091
944179,5,6304981643,"Some movies lose their appeal over time, but not this one! Angelica Huston specifically showed her strength as an actress as Cusack's scam artist mom. Annette Bening is gorgeous and believable as Cusack's girlfriend. And of course Cusack himself was terrific as a sort of straight man between the two rival con-artist women. I never will forget the scene where Huston tries to run down Bening in a parking lot.

944180,5,6304981643,"Here is a modern-day ""film noir,"" if I ever saw one. You get sleazy characters with no morals, brutal attitudes, some interesting photography and a story that is not exactly a happy one - all the ingredients of a good noir. Since the film is a 1990 one and not the '40s and '50s (in which purists think that's the only period for noirs), you also get nudity and profanity.

The best part of the film, to me, is the fact that the three leading characters are so interesting. You never know what these intriguing characters are going to do next. John Cusack, Angelica Huston and  Annette Bening are all fascinating. Three supporting guys in here are fantastic, too: Pat Hingle, J.T. Walsh and Charles Napier.  Overall, this is a wonderful cast that does full justice to this unusual crime story.

The story has a mean edge to it most of the way, but that's the style of writer Jim Thompson, who is a very good crime author who wrote the novel on which this movie is based. He has written several fascinating books. Donald Westlake, who wrote the screenplay, is a prolific crime story writer.

THE GRIFTERS... I won't go into the plot. Other reviewers have done enough. But it does poke at some old questions. Is there honor among thieves? No, not really. But can there be respect? Yes, I think the film brings that out. What about love? Ooof! That's a tough one.

IF you've seen the movie, and liked it, the commentaries are wonderful. But even more important is the glimpse at the life of Jim Thompson whose novel inspired the film. The making of THE GRIFTERS is equally intriguing. I'm no grifter, although at times I wish I were...

944184,2,6304981643,"To me, The Grifters reminded me of a plain cheese sandwich.  While you specifically order the sandwich for the ""cheese"" element, without the bread there would be no sandwich at all.  When you take a bite, the softness and delicate nature of the bread will give you your first impressions of the rest of the sandwich.  It is the first and last thing you taste, so it needs to remain consistent, tasty, and fresh.  The Grifters was the bread to your average sandwich.  The beginning and end of this film was innovative and creative as was the darkly depressing ending, just like a slice of fresh bread, but the center of the film left much to be desired.  The center of the film ruined the entire cinematic experience due to its lack of direction, consistently poor filler, and sub-par feeling that this wasn't the best cheese sandwich ever made, but instead just one created for the masses.  It was disappointing to see this film implode from the inside, but one cannot shake those breathtaking moments that anchored this film out of their mind.  Director Frears did a decent job, but I think that if Scorsese would have helmed this project, it would have been something entirely different ... and enjoyable.

One of my major concerns with this film was the acting.  Here we have this gritty, pulp-ish film that really needed to have some powerhouse actors ensuring that we see this darkness from our couches, but instead it seemed like none of the main cast was giving their full potential.  I had trouble with Cusack because of his 80s comedy roots.  He was my major issue with the film Eight Men Out, and a big element in this one.  He just cannot seem to release that raw emotion that takes you away from Cusack the actor and immerses you deeply into the life of Roy Dillon.  For the entire film, I kept seeing Cusack (a la Better off Dead...) instead of the powerful character he was supposed to be.  The same can be said for the other actors as well.  While I do believe that Huston was the stand out player in this film, she wasn't spectacular.  Her character was too underdeveloped for us to really have a handle on her issues.  I felt no emotion for her when she was having trouble with the mob because I knew nothing of her history.  It was assumed, and that is where Frears tumbled this film.  Bening, well, was a naked Bening.  She spent more time without clothes than really showing us her intellect behind grifting.  I realize that nudity was her superpower, but this was a character driven film, and these characters needed more development, more emotion, and more substance than what was presented.

The story seemed choppy to me.  While, again, I will state that the beginning segment and ending climax were superbly designed, the rest of the film jumped from one place to another giving us less and less per each jump.  It was as if Frears had extra time in his film and needed to fill it with whatever he could to pass the time.  I would have loved to see more time with Dillon's mentor, more between Lilly and Bobo, and several more scenes with Myra to fully explain how she fell into this picture.  Frears spent too much time filling holes with scenes that were fun, but not poignant.  This ultimately hurt the film in the long run because by the end, we didn't care.  An apathetic viewer proves that you have lost the battle.

Finally, the element that completely caught me off guard was the mother/son combination that Frears did incorporate well into the story.  At first, I thought this was going to be a film about a big grift that would tear down our characters one by one with disgust and distrust, but instead Frears changed it to this wild dynamic between Cusack and Huston.  Their chemistry together was decent.  While some moments felt like reading was difficult for the two, other moments seemed to send electricity through the air.  Frears developed the idea that the vicious circle of life does exist and this mother/son combination is living proof.  Roy becomes what Lilly tried to leave him out of, and even falls for a girl that is similar to his mother.  Roy is so engulfed in his mother that the ending should come as no surprise when Frears changes themes from mother/son to a near Oedipus complex.  It is shivering, but in this film it works.  This element kept my eyes focused on the film longer than I should have, but I had to see where Frears was going with this.

Overall, I wasn't impressed.  As I bit into this cinematic cheese sandwich, I thought it was going to bring new flavors into my mouth.  I was waiting for that surge of intense flavor (which happened on the first and last bit), but throughout the center I was left with nothing more than a couple of slices of cheese that provided me with no fulfillment.  The actors could have been stronger.  Cusack is still growing and I think that the early 90s were too early for him to try to develop his drama wings.  He needed more time, with smaller roles in independent dramas, to fully grasp what he was getting into.  I do not see where the awards were needed for this film, but perhaps it is because I had not read the book that this film was based.  Maybe it was the darkness surrounding this film, or Bening's nudity, but it just didn't leave that lasting impression on me.  Skip it, you will not be disappointed.

944185,4,6304981643,"We watch the opening titles against a series of black and white stills of a 1950's Los Angeles. The music is nervous and bleak like the droning business of an impassive throng of insects. The last shot is of the city at night, from a distance--only so many halo-ed points of light in a black that pushes the skyscrapers into an unaffecting doom. We then cut to the film proper and to a sensational opening set-piece: the camera is following Lily Dillon as she enters a race track. She steps onto an escalator and the camera falls back and watches her rise. The screen splits and, while the camera looks up at Lily, it is looking down at her son Roy who is getting out of his car. As both cameras begin to rise and lower to their respective subjects, the screen then splits in three and we now see Roy's girlfriend Myra approaching a jewelry shop. The cameras are now level with all three characters and slowly move in as they stand before the entrance of the betting parlor, the bar and the jewelry store. Lily, Roy and Myra all turn around, look right and then left, and then turn to enter. They are grifters, con-artists, masters of short performances in charm and diversion. Lily places bets on long shots at the track to lower the odds and the pay-outs of the bookies for whom she works. Myra specializes in big-time investment scams, but she's short a partner, down on her luck and looking to seduce her mark. Roy works on another and lower order, short-changing bartenders, rolling trick dice for a soldier's pay or making bar bets for quarters and dimes. But whatever the dimensions of their grift--their con--they all feel the same need to take that one last look before going under.

Lily makes her grift, reports in and is told to move to the race track at La Hoya. On her way, she decides to visit Roy, her son whom she had when she was a mere 14 and from whom she has been estranged for some 8 years. Roy made his first grift that day but, during the second, was caught and given a blow to the stomach with a baseball bat. When his mother arrives, she finds him cold and faint from internal bleeding and has a mob doctor admit him to the hospital. But Roy's misfortune will prove to be everyone else's. Lily and Myra take an instant disliking to one another despite their apparent sameness--or, perhaps, for that very reason. Roy has found a girl that looks like his young mother and, to his surprise, turns out to be a grifter of the same magnitude. In any case, Lily misses the race as a result of her surprising maternal drive; the long-shot wins and mob-boss, Bobo, delivers a frightening lesson in what it would mean to miss another. Myra, in the meanwhile, spies Lily skimming money from the mob purse, which she hides in the under trunk of her Cadillac. Myra lets the mob know, then sets a trap to steal Lily's money for herself. The result is a harried turn of deception, ruthlessness and murderous cunning.

This is, I think, one of the very rare occasions when film has succeeded in lifting Jim Thompson's mean, misery-laden poetry to the screen. For once, we actually see his unattached, dispassionate loners with the ""irresistible urge to be the guy who's wise"". They live alone in undistinguished apartment houses and motel rooms that mimic the lives they are supposed to be living. But they can't live because they have no capacity to feel for others; pity and empathy are an obstacle to such under-craft. And they are so set upon their singular survival, that they can never enjoy real trust--not between grifter and grifter, lover and lover, nor even between mother and son.",1112745600,11,3602,4.548536209553158
944186,4,6304981643,"Petty criminals in the American society. They are small, they are vain, they are insignificant. One cheats in bars to give ten dollars and get the change on twenty. One works for a bookmaker and bets heavy sums on outsiders in horse-races to force the odds and make people bet on the horse for nothing, but she becomes greedy and steals some of the money from her boss, who is a lot bigger than she is. A third one is trying to sell fake diamonds to a jeweller to make an easy profit when she is not selling her body for petty sums. And life goes on. But when danger comes up they find out that among them there can be no team spirit, only hate and jealousy. If one needs to get away for a while, she does not hesitate to kill to make her getaway. In such a profession there is no partner. One is entirely alone and against the whole world. That's the psychology of the profession. But Frears goes a little bit further than that and deals with them as a metaphor of society at large, of all those men and women who make a living out of sheer financial speculation. Their interest is to make an easy and fast buck and they do not see their fellow men and women as men and women any more but only as obstacles, at best, and as non-existing collaterals, at worst. A society dominated by such greed can only become dishumanized and rotting from the inside. Life becomes war and death is the most banal thing you can deal with. You kill not to make the other one die, but you kill your would-be partners to escape the claws of the big preybirds in this society.

944337,5,6304981643,"""The Grifters"" is a great realization of writer Jim Thompson's pulp novel to the screen.  Kudos to director Stephen Frears and Donald Westlake's screenplay for translating this work to the screen.  The film concerns itself with a trio of con artists but the mark this time is the soul of one of these combatants.  Lily(Anjelica Huston) has been at this game practically from the womb but she discourages her son, Roy(John Cusack), from the grift.  Roy's current squeeze, Myra(Annette Bening) has different plans for him.  Myra has done the big con and she sees Roy as her meal ticket to easy street.  Huston has never been better as the grifter with questionable maternal instincts.  Bening superficial sweetness betrays an interior of larceny.  Roy, though he does not have the stomach for the big grift, is not blind to the machinations of Lily and Myra.  Cusack does an excellent job showing bemusement as these two mother hens fight over him.  ""The Grifters"" has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's inevitable conclusion is so shocking that I dare not reveal it here.  Just marvel at some very talented artists that are on the top of their game.",1104019200,7,1181,4.763546798029557
944338,3,6304981643,"""The Grifters"" is one of the earliest Neo-Noir films that appeared in the early 1990s, and it helped to pave the way to films like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", because the Film Noir genre was a little under the radar in the early 1990s.

""The Grifters"" has a talented cast that includes John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and the beautiful Annette Bening. Perhaps the best interaction between characters are the hate-envy relationship between Anjelica's character and Annette's character, they hate each other and they are capable of some dirty tricks to make disappear the other.

""The Grifters"" gets better in the final 30 minutes, a lot of interesting revelations are made, and the characters reveal their real intentions.",1092268800,,730,5.126050420168068
944339,5,6304981643,"This is a splendid film. One of the hard movies of this decade. A chess game in the purest sense of the word. The underworld of these little gamblers ond fortune seekers was depicted with origianilty and built on a solid script and secondary characters that enrich even more this story.
Angelica Huston is her best performance (I like even her Award performance Prizzi's honor) ; John Cussack made a brighting performance and Anette Benning superb.
The film plays hard . It's a neo film noir but it keeps for the viewer several smart bits and clever twist of fate: a little homagge to ""The sting"" ; in the middle of the movie and fine dialogues ; specially in the tour de force dialogue Huston and her son and the frenetic and anguishly fight Huston - Benning in the motel .
Frears is a very original film maker but besides its intimate character this film may be well considered his masterpiece.",1088640000,2,896,4.571428571428571
944340,5,6304981643,"Those of us who love this film, love it a lot. It is one of my all time top films that I watch shamelessly for record numbers of times and love the same, if not more. So, The Grifters is right up there on my big board along with Body Heat, Black Widow, Peggy Sue Got Married, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Diabolique (the original)and Splendor in the Grass (the original)and The Long Good Friday. Atmosphere, performances, dazzling movie style and grace, heart and soul.
I will never understand how Jeremy Irons, during his visit with James Lipton on Inside the Actor's Studio, could possibly state that American films lacked soul while the British films had long since cornered the market in that particular quality. The Grifters is as loaded to the gills with every quality necessary to film greatness as the greatest British, or any other European film ever made.
This film always has impressed me as a very close relation to the fabulous ""Long Good Friday"" with Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren (English Gangster film par exellence). These folks are not burdened with the need to justify their lives or livelihoods. Remember Bob Hoskins character reminiscing fondly about his boyhood start as a gangster doing some scam with cars and intimidation. Whenever the grifter or the gangster gets a big dose of self-righteous indignation, it is alway for his or her own benefit and never applied to another victim, harmless or otherwise.
I love the blurring of eras in the Grifters, the feeling that although the story is depicted in the 1980's, it has the rich, indefinable quality of Alfred Hitchcock's films from the 1950's. The Grifters takes the American film to the top of the world's cinema and challenges the rest of the world to do better.
On a sadder note, it is also the pinnacle of American short-sightednes and just plain old bourgeois lack of artistic sense, not to award films like Grifters the big awards that are so well deserved. Perhaps the Academy feels that you can only let a good independent film have its day every ten or so years and let the Cannes Film Festival, or Sundance, or whoever take care of the rest of the finest productions of cinematic artistry.",1085184000,3,2178,4.764550264550264
944341,5,6304981643,"If, like me, you saw and loved Stephen Frears' 2003 outing ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (starring Audrey Tautou in her first English-speaking role), consider going back and watching what is arguably his finest effort, ""The Grifters.""
This is a wonderful movie featuring three very talented actors.  In 1990, John Cusack was just transitioning into adult roles, in much the same way his character Roy Dillon is doing.  A perfect fit.
Annette Benning lets it all hang out, as she has done with all of her performances, even after ascending into Hollywood royalty as Mrs. Warren Beatty.
Despite those stellar performances, they're still no match for Angelica Huston.  She is truly magnetic as Cusak's mother, Lilly.
Also worthy of note is long-time character actor Pat Hingle's turn as Lilly's boss, Bobo Justus.  It's essentially a cameo role, but it's the performance that stands out foremost in my mind two months after viewing.",1084147200,3,921,5.12
944342,5,6304981643,"In my opinion after Good Fellas, The Grifters was by far the best movie of 1990. Unfortunately both movies came out in a year that members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided that Kevin Costner's over praised Dances With Wolves was the best thing that had happened to the film world since the money making PG-13 rating.
Readers of my reviews may know that I hate to give away even the smallest detail in trying to express whether I liked a movie or not, so all that I will say is that the movie involves three characters involved in different types of con games, a theme that was explored in a wickedly delectable fashion in Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liasons. What makes both of these movies so exciting is that although they all have elements of violence, the most potent weapons used are the brain and the heart. All characters are flawed in one way or another, their actions are believable, and most of the time the consequences of said actions will lead to something that cannot be stopped.
The three leading performers are John Cusack, Angelica Houston, and Annette Benning. Both Huston and Benning were nominated for the Oscar, but both were robbed of the gold by more showy performances by Kathy Bates and Whoopi Goldberg, in Misery and Ghost, respectively. John Cusack and the movie itself were not even nominated. At least Stephen Frears finally received a well-deserved nomination for Direction as he was ignored for Dangerous Liaisons.
Angelica Houston gives one of the gutsiest and most unsentimental performances ever filmed. Annette Benning has never been better. She's like a cat in this movie and uses her body and intelligence to create an illusion of what she wants people to see. John Cusack, who rarely if ever has hit a false note in his career, brings surprising humanity and a defiance to create a character that is hard to forget. Every single supporting performance, especially Pat Hingle and J.T. Walsh, make a strong impression and serve to give the movie a strong base to take its challenging path without ever feeling like it has cheated the audience in any of its multiple surprises.
In a nutshell, although the story is very well crafted, it's the direction and performances that make this movie resonate. It's simply a joy to watch actors at the top of their game, and for me it was a hoot to see Annette Benning to her thing as this was the first time that I had seen any of her work. When I see a movie like this, which I just saw for the first time since it first came out, I am reminded of how much I love movies made for adults and made without the commercial tie-ins, focus groups, and ratings considerations that seem to rule the industry with more frequency. Don't get me wrong, I too enjoy a well made pop-corn summer flick, but it is movies like The Grifters that stay with you long after you see them. More recent examples include 1997's underrated The Ice Storm and Jackie Brown as well as 2000's Memento. If you like movies that look into the dark places of the mind, are unapologetically unsentimental, and focus on characters who are not cardboard stereotypes, this one is for you. One note, it's not a movie for kids as there are some scenes and ideas that are already hard to watch as an adult.",1083974400,5,3266,4.623063683304647
944343,5,6304981643,"Just like in The Sting where the audience is ultimately the victim of the scam/plot of the film, The Grifters finally makes the viewer challenge what they know about the three main characters in the film.
Since the three leads played by John Cusack, Angelica Huston, and Annette Benning, are all in the business of deceiving other people for profit, we have to treat what they say with more than a little skepticism.  In fact, by the end of the film, we have to wonder if these characters are so immersed in their world of ""the grift"" that they can't even be truthful with themselves.

944344,5,6304981643,"The movie is based on the book (same title) by Jim Thompson, and stays fairly close to the theme of the book. (Though, they touch on the nurse in the movie, the nurse actually had a little more of a part in the book.) To me, it's important that a movie based on a book does it's original source justice, and I think this movie does just Jim Thompson's crime noir justice.
This is amongst my Top 5 Movies of All Time. And, I think, is amongst the best work John Cusack has ever done in his career.
The interaction between the characters is executed well. Anjelica Huston, Annette Benning, and John Cusack all play their roles to the tilt, and when I read the book, I could see each actor playing their particular characters.
Though, the book was set in the '50s, you never really know what era they are in in the movie. I like the mystery of that. The women in '40s dresses and John wearing a skinny tie which was popular both in the '60s and '80s. I think that's how the movie has aged so well, and that will keep it timeless.
I read someone else's review here that their DVD/this particular DVD doesn't have any bonuses. If you get the special edition DVD of The Grifters, you'll get bonuses.

944406,5,6304981643,"'The Grifters' is so far removed from most people's reality that it lives in that netherworld called a fairy tale or maybe even more to the point a nightmare.
The world of 'The Grifters' is a world of bookies, murder, torture, betrayal, incest and of course, thievery. Some of what goes on; especially in the beginning involving Lilly (Angelica Huston) at the racetrack is so complicated as to become Byzantine in nature.
But at the core of 'The Grifters' is the odd, fascinating relationship of Lilly and her son Roy (John Cusack) that plays out like a modern day Oedipus Rex. And isn't Myra (Annette Bening), Roy's girlfriend really Lilly as a younger woman? And isn't that why Lilly can't stomach her?
Stephen Frears directs with a magical eye on all the details both physical and personal. And Huston, Cusack and Bening have never been more emphatically truthful since. This is inspired filmmaking of the highest order.",1053129600,2,923,4.885350318471337

I'm not going to say the movie is flawless, but honestly I can't think of anything particularly negative to say about it.
The DVD is a modest collector's edition.  Some may say the extra features are a bit spare, but what is here is very useful and informative.  The commentary track is consistantly listenable.  There are four participants:  the director, the screenwriter, and stars Cusack and Huston.  The four were recorded separately and edited together seamlessly to make an entertaining and insightful track.  Also here are two short but well-made featurettes, one covers the making of the film and the other sheds some light on the work of the author who wrote the book upon which the film is based.",1041811200,26,987,4.963414634146342
944408,5,6304981643,"The Grifters provides an extremely interesting look at some genuinely sleazy parasite con-artists who pretty much ended up living the lives they deserved.  The story is well told and the characters quite credible (albeit squalid).
Myra Langtry, however, certainly appeared to be a fun date.",1025654400,2,290,5.444444444444445
944409,4,6304981643,"What Lilly Dillon (Anjelica Huston in a long tight dress) is doing in this movie is laying off a bookie's bets.  But, like a lot else in this plot-challenged movie, it's not really realistic.  The way it's suppose to work is this: the bookie takes in some big time money on a long shot.  This understandably scares the bookie since the fix may be on (or the nag might win legitimately) and if so, he's out a whole lot of money.  So to protect himself, HE bets on the nag (using a confederate at the track).
This is called hedging.  Hedging, whether in sports betting or in the stock or commodities markets works like an insurance policy.  But it comes at a price.  Take a simpler case.  The Yankees are entertaining the Dodgers at Yankee Stadium.  The bookie gets a couple of $10,000 bets on the Dodgers.  Since his daily handle is usually about half that, he begins to sweat.  Sure, he'll have a $20,000-day if the Yankees win, but what if the Dodgers win?  Then he's out big bucks and maybe out of business.  So what does he do?  He hedges; that is he goes to a bigger bookie or to his Lilly in Las Vegas and lays off the action with a $20,000 bet on the Dodgers.  Now if the Dodgers win he breaks even and lives to book another day.  If the Yankees win, he still breaks even (instead of winning $20,000).  But that's the price he pays for laying off, for hedging.  Call it insurance.
Now the problem with all this in the movie is that Lilly cannot be at every race track in the country.  So for Director Stephen Frears to make the action plausible he needs to show that Lilly's regular job is to hang out in California (by the phone!) to cover the West Coast tracks in case a lot of strange money comes in that the bookie needs to lay off.  Presumably this is what Lilly is doing in the movie.  For more realism, Frears could have shown Lilly hanging by the phone, working for several bookies.
Frears has a great cast and they do a fine job.  But the plot contrivances keep this from being a really top notch noir flick.  Worse stupidity is the scene in which Myra (Annette Bening) finds a motel key on her 100-plus key ring to open Lilly's motel door.  Even though Lilly is on the run, apparently she doesn't bother with a second lock, or the chain lock.  (Sure.)  Second worse stupidity is Lilly sitting in the track's parking lot in full view of the grandstand overhead (although admittedly many feet away) with the trunk of her car open and a drawer full of money exposed for all the world to see.  She doesn't have to play with her money in the parking lot.  She can wait until she gets to her motel.  But this contrivance allows Myra to see the money with binoculars.  And as for Roy Dillon (John Cusack) hiding his money inside some strangely thick clown paintings in his living room...I don't think so.  And Dillon finding one die on the floor of the dining room car of the train doesn't work either because later he has to ""find"" the other one (an action we don't see) so he can fleece the sailors with his loaded dice.

Not all the action is unrealistic however.  Roy Dillon's little hustle with the flashing of the twenty and the switch to the ten is an actual con done innumerable times; and the reaction of bar keep who catches Dillon in the act is perfect, illustrating how people who work at cash registers feel about people who work little cons on them.  And the business beginning when Lilly doesn't lay off the money on ""Troubadour,"" and hears the very sad news on the radio that the horse actually wins the race, and then gets punished by her boss, is realistic because he is out some serious money.  By the way, a person in Lilly's position, in effect becomes a bookie herself, if she wants to.  She can bet a little less on the nag and pocket the change when the nag loses, as the nag usually will.  Of course if she bets nothing, the tote board odds don't go down and so the bookie will know.  Worse is when she doesn't bet and the nag comes in.  Now she has to pay the bookie out of her own money.  In the case of Troubadour, a 70 to one shot, obviously she couldn't afford to pay off and so had to take a beating, literary.  The dialogue between her and Bobo (Pat Hingle) is perfect if you understand that he knows that she steals a little, here and there.
Be forewarned that the subplot is Oedipal and spicily played in parts.  I'm sure Huston and Cusack had a few laughs off camera, but we are left not really knowing whether Lilly really is his mother or not.  (Perhaps that's a good thing.)
All in all there's some nice grifter atmosphere in the movie and Cusack is interesting as a baby-faced little hustler, and Bening is sleazy, sexy and desperate, while Huston is both fawning and cowardly, and sneaky strong.  In short, the cast is interesting and they do a great job.  See this for Anjelica Huston who makes a complex character real.",1024358400,17,4870,4.332596685082873

Much of Thompson's dialogue from the book is in the film and it is from another time and doesn't always fit to a 90s time setting.

When Roy's mother's visit after a long separation coincides with a ""big"" con his sleazy girlfriend has cooked up, everything falls apart.  Con men rarely thrive in packs and this crowd shows you why.
This movie has little substance on why these shallow people stayed in the lives they had and offered little depth into what moved them other than the ""con"".  You just get a glimse of their shady ploys and sleight of hand and wind up caring about them as much as they do their victims.

Instead, we're given an ENDLESS series of flashbacks which, the filmmakers feel, must EXPLAIN these characters and how they got here, how they became who they are, etc.  When so much of your movie is constituted of flashbacks, you may very well doubt the viability of your story.  Another nit to pick:  director Stephen Frears mistakenly attempted to keep the book's snappy Post-War urban lingo intact, to say nothing of the basic lifestyle of the  ""confidence game""  (a dead profession whose only remnant is that reliable stand-by, credit-card fraud.  ""Big""  con?  Why bother?  Selling drugs is easier.)  He would've been better advised to either set the movie in its original period or make the characters talk like people living in 1990 Los Angeles.  The world of  *The Grifters*  seems unreal, or at least moving in a parallel universe . . . and surrealism's not the best tone to set in a crime movie.
I feel the acting's been overpraised, too.  Angelica Huston plays Lilly as if she's Lady Macbeth.  Some will say it's brilliant; I say it's irrealistic and reaches too much.  Annette Bening?  OK, lemme get this straight:  she's supposed to be a consummate con-woman . . . and yet, she has her hair done up a la Medusa, she's dressed like a tart, preening and purring all over the place like a cat in heat.  Uh, that's not a con; that's  ""BAD GIRL""  in Vegas neon visible for miles.  (The point of a con-artist is to FOOL people.)  Say much the same for Huston's 1950's peroxide fright-wig, by the way.  John Cusack, however, is the best thing in the movie:  he's snide, tough, and totally self-interested, befitting such a character.  And Pat Hingle is overwhelming as Lilly's terrifying mob boss, Bobo.  (That scene with the pillow-case full of oranges still lingers ten years later.)
*The Grifters*  has its moments, but its flaws simply run too deep to prompt a whole-hearted recommendation.",978480000,13,2051,4.793696275071634
944471,5,6304981643,"Of course, the star trio (Huston, Cusack, and Bening) is flawless, but veteran ""heavy"" Pat Hingle, late as Commissioner Gordon of the ""Batman"" films holds his own as ""Bobo Justis,"" Huston's ""sugar daddy,"" to say the least.  His malevolent character does not warrant any sympathy and his abuse of Huston is quite disturbing.  However, one won't forget him, either.
""The Grifters"" also sports a great Elmer Bernstein score, subtle but highly effective.",976752000,2,450,5.236111111111111
944472,5,6304981643,"This is an extremely entertaining and fascinating look into the lives of con-men and con-women. Angelica Huston gives her best performance as the icy blonde con-mother of Roy, she is simply masterful in this film. John  Cusack also gives his best and grittiest performance as Roy, a small-time  con who wants to get out. Annette Bening is also excellent as Roy's  knockout girlfriend who is looking for the long-con. The split-screen  introduction sequence is great. Stephen Frears directs with cold assurance.  Fascinating characters and plot, intelligent sharp dialogue and 3  powerhouse performances. One of the best movies of 1990. Extras: that's  Martin Scorcese's voice narrating at the beginning of the film, he also  produced. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",958262400,9,777,5.16
944473,5,6304981643,"Produced by Martin Scorsese and directed by Stephen Frears, THE GRIFTERS is a winner. With three top actors, Anjelica Huston, Annette Bening and John Cusack, Frears invites us to a non-stop ride to hell.
Caught between  his mother and his girl-friend, John Cusack will have a hard time to  survive and become a man. You can almost touch the hate those two women  feel for each other. Their last encounter is really a scene you will  remember : set in Phoenix, in a motel, in a subtle variation of PSYCHO's  first murder, it is a moment of great cinema.
Cusack is outstanding as  the gentle grifter, Frear's cinematography is first class and Anjelica has  never been so devilish. No doubt about it, THE GRIFTERS is a masterpiece of  the film noir genre.
