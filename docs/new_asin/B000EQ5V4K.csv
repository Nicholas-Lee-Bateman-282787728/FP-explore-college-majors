I felt no excitement after viewing this movie and intend on selling it to another viewer.",1243555200,7,257,4.204081632653061
8112960,1,B000EQ5V4K,"Insatiable Wives (Mike Sedan, 2000)

Until a few nights ago, I'd watched exactly one softcore movie all the way through. (That being Black Emmanuelle, the movie I've used as a yardstick for filmed sex scenes for the past quarter century or more since I first saw it.) I then doubled my entire-softcore-movie consumption with Insatiable Wives, which is just about as silly as the title makes it sound.

In case you need a synopsis: Donna (Stephanee LaFleur) is feeling neglected in her marriage. Her three best friends, Sandra (Ahmo Hight), Marjorie (Chandra Marie), and Annie (LoriDawn Messuri), all seem to have perfect relationships with their husbands. What's a girl to do? Well, in Donna's case, the answer seems to be a dream where she spends a day as each of her friends. With, of course, a great deal of softcore sex involved. The main question seems to be whether she'll enjoy it, or whether she'll come to find out that her own marriage is great. (Not that there's much suspense on that front, since the foreshadowing comes thick and fast. No pun intended.)

Maybe Black Emmanuelle spoiled me, but I like solid characters along with my sex. While I admit that Insatiable Wives does have something vaguely resembling a plot-- in fact, it's probably got more in that regard than Black Emmanuelle does-- it seems that the screenwriter decided that since he was actually going to switch the characters around every few minutes, he might as well make them interchangeable. Big mistake for anyone who's actually going to attempt to follow the story. I grant you, most probably won't, but still, there's the occasional odd duck out there who does, in fact, read Playboy for the articles.

I guess I'll keep sticking with the Albertini movies. At least they've got Laura Gemser. *",1216339200,2,1781,4.867986798679868
8112961,5,B000EQ5V4K,"A couple of laugh out louds, and a well written for the genre flick.  Joe Sarno would be proud.  Blows away any Surrender Cinema drivel.  And I like them girls!",1185753600,6,160,4.266666666666667
8112962,5,B000EQ5V4K,"It's a shame that this is billed as erotica.  Unique in that class, this movie has all the ingredients of a mainstream movie: a very clever story, a superb star, and even a moral.  The theme song is far above average.

Stephanee LaFleur is a gifted comedienne, better than most mainstream comediennes.  It's a pity that she will probably never get a chance to prove it, since the two movies she made are both erotica.  She could give Reese and Meg Ryan a run for their money.  She also has a beautiful face and a superb body.

There is lots of nudity and simulated sex in this movie, but unlike most erotica, the sex is dictated by the story.  And it is never the same scene twice.  In between, there is even some character development and relationship development.  In fact, relationships and marriages is what this movie is all about.

If you've ever wished there was a sex movie that was like a mainstream movie, this is it.",1169337600,28,927,4.458333333333333
