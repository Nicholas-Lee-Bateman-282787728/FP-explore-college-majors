It doesn't have much of a story and features some pretty average acting, but I think the older it gets, the better it looks. It's now quite nostalgic to watch it and see the old Holden's and hear the soundtrack from Aussie bands such as The Skyhooks and 'Ol 55. I have always loved the movie and even bought an old FJ (a white one) and drove it around for a few years in the early '90's before selling it and buying a green EH panelvan just like the one in the film.
For those not familiar with Australian cars, Holden is basically GM's Australian division which began building Holden's in 1948, the FJ being a facelift of the original model. It was built from '53-'56 and is considered to be THE Australian classic, much like the '57 Chevy is to the USA. The police cars in the movie are Chrysler Valiant's (basically Australian Plymouth's) which ceased production here back in 1981.
In short, I guess the movie could be seen as the Aussie version of American Graffiti, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who liked that.",1212278400,2,1149,4.4245283018867925
8246589,5,B0012KQN80,"I grew up in the area in Sydney where and when this film was made. Greenacre and Bankstown in the mid 70's. The movie revolves around a bloke, his sheila, and his mates but most importantly his car. His FJ. Most of the actors were amateurs but this only brings a reality to the film. I rate it very highly for anyone who wants a sense of being an Australian in a more  cherished time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-FJ-Holden-aka-The-F-J-Holden-All-Regions-PAL-Unrated-DVD/dp/B0012KQN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The FJ Holden aka The F.J.
