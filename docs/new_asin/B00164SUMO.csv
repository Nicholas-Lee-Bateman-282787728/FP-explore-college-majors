8260864,5,B00164SUMO,"My husband got me a uke for my birthday and I borrowed many instructional videos from the library, looking for one I found most helpful. Most were by guys who played the cheesy Tiny Tim style uke - not authentic Hawaiian uke. Then I found this one...Teresa Bright's DVD was the one I was looking for so I bought a copy for myself. Real Hawaiian songs and style taught by a native. Teresa's  teaching style is clear and concise. She leads you through the lessons in an easy to follow style. Included are Hawaiian tunes performed by Teresa (Who is very a talented performer as well as a good teacher). The exercises are simple and easy to follow along with. Highly recommended!!!",1406678400,,677,4.549180327868853
8260865,5,B00164SUMO,I really enjoy this video and Teresa is a great teacher. The chords come onto the screen at just the right rate so you can follow along.,1372118400,,136,4.074074074074074
8260866,2,B00164SUMO,Don't know how 2 others gave it FIVE stars. For HALF the price get Ukulele Primer with DVD $10. This DVD just gave you the different chords and strumming (only 1 kind of strums). For beginners Hal Leonard DVD the best. Hal Leonard product always reliable!,1355270400,,255,4.565217391304348
8260867,5,B00164SUMO,"This selection is perfect for a beginner ukulele player. The copy I ordered through Amazon arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. The lessons begin with a description of the instrument itself, and then teaches, in a very simple way, the various chord families. At the end of the DVD, Teresa Bright, the instructor, sings a couple of songs with the chords noted at the bottom of the screen so it is easy to follow. This is an outstanding instructional tool for anyone interested in getting a good start on playing the ukulele.",1333238400,,539,4.684210526315789
8260868,5,B00164SUMO,"I adore Teresa Bright's music and was so happy to find this video as I am just learning to play the ukulele. The instruction is very clear although I was disappointed that the DVD did not include a chord sheet and music sheets of the 3 songs you learn to play (and sing along with her).

The DVD includes a very easy to use menu system including:
Introduction:
Includes tuning and strumming instruction and practice.
The C chord series:
Teaches you C chord series, practice the series together, and play ""Ho'olauna Aloha""
The F chord series:
Teaches you F chord series, practice the series together, and play ""Healoha no Honolulu""
The G chord series:
Teaches you G chord series, practice the series together, and play ""Lehua Makanoe
Review chords:
A quick, easy way to view all the chords used throughout the instructions

I like it that she does a tuning check before beginning the song to make sure it sounds good as you play along with her while she sings. Each item in the menu takes you to a secondary menu where you can individually pick out any of the items (learning chords, practice chords, tuning check, and playing the song).

My all time favorite song of Teresa Bright's is ""Nani Kaua'i"" on the Makaha Sons & Friends ""Na Pua O Hawaii"" album. I was really hoping to learn that song on this DVD and will look for a music sheet as this is a very beautiful Hawaiian song.

Also, I highly recommend ""Jiminy Kokopo's Ukulele Sing and Strum Fun Book"" for all age groups that are starting out with the Ukulele. I will have a review on the book in the very near future.
