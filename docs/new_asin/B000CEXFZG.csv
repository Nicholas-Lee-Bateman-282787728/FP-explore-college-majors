2462460,5,B000CEXFZG,"If you love Teen Titans like my family does, PLEASE send emails (letters work even better) to Cartoon Network (go to CartoonNetwork.com) demanding, begging, pleading that CN renew the show! As of January 12, 2006, there are only three episodes left.  By the way, you can't go wrong with this DVD, it's just a shame that the rest of us were bilked by CN into buying two separate DVDs that contained Season One. The episodes are funny, action packed and leave you wanting more. Buy and enjoy!  This is the best show on Cartoon Network!",1137024000,44,533,4.6
2462461,5,B000CEXFZG,"When producing Teen Titans, I'm sure they didn't want to recreate what Justice League already was, but instead make something new.  Please, don't compare the two anymore.

Teen Titans is suitable for all ages, children and adults alike.  There's always something for anyone and everyone to like about the series, and enough to keep them watching.  It's definitely NOT the same thing over and over again; the episodes are very diverse, from sometimes twisted comedy (Mad Mod) to dark and intense (Masks).",1136592000,4,503,5.097560975609756
2462462,5,B000CEXFZG,"This set compiles two previously released discs, making up the entire first season of Cartoon Network's breakaway hit that introduced the Titans to a new generation and paved the way for Japanese popsters Puffy Amiyumi to develop their own cartoon show.  Season 1's overall arc introduces Slade (known in the comics as Deathstroke The Terminator) and his attempts to coerce Robin into becoming his apprentice, and Robin's continued battle against Slade and his influence.

Slade is presented here as the anti-Batman, making a much more frightening villain than Bane (who is actually a good villian but has been presented in most cinematic media as a thorough waste of ink). Despite the detractors' complaints of its anime influence, Teen Titans is a well-written and extremely well-done series, with seasons 2, 3, and 4 going on to deal with Slade's destruction and its aftermath, Brother Blood and the Hive, the creation of the West Coast team, the threat of Raven's demonoid father Triton and her attempts to break from her past, and an all-out battle with the Brotherhood Of Evil featuring an appearance from the honest-to-God DOOM PATROL (one of DC Comics' most underrated and creative concepts, and often unfairly compared with the X-Men).

All in all, a good and enjoyable buy worth having in your hero-toons collection.  Now if they'll release the other seasons mentioned here in box sets, and if Warner Bros. will do the same thing with its Justice League series, and Nickelodeon does the same with Danny Phantom and Teenage Robot, all will be cool.  (Note to TV studios: Due to the dearth of good TV, some of us out there WILL BUY DVD sets if they're done right--no need to dribble stuff out!)",1136419200,14,1702,4.937062937062937
2462463,4,B000CEXFZG,"Ok, I am a mother of 3 little girls.  My two oldest are 3 and 4 and they love the Teen Titans, and I must admit that I like them, too.  I have already bought the first 3 releases.  Season 1, volume 1 and 2, and season 2, volume 1.  Does anyone know how many more episodes are on this dvd that aren't on volume's 1 and 2?  I hate to spend the money on this dvd if there aren't many other episodes on it.

Thanks to any who respond....and we are a Teen Titan family, lol.  I think that's all we watch, over and over and over again.  But my husband and I always find ourselves asking the girls to move so we can watch, too.  LOL",1136246400,7,625,3.8203125
2462464,5,B000CEXFZG,The show is covering new territory. It is taking a more personal aspect to superhero lives. It focuses more on the aspects of teamwork and on unique contributions to a complete team. The animation may be mildly shabby but in all the concepts and ideas behind the show are great. The producers have created a more realistic show where these five teens actually go through common situations with a hero twist.,1136160000,7,407,4.746478873239437
2462465,4,B000CEXFZG,"This 2-disc set collects the first 13 episodes of Teen Titans, which were also previously released on 2 single-disc editions.

I like Teen Titans. It's a very different take on the DC characters than Batman, Superman, and Justice League, and there are obvious anime influences in the fight scenes and gags. What's nice about the series is that while it generally writes towards a younger audience, it's never so simplistic that it alienates the older crowd. The chemistry between the five leads is great, and there are occasional moments of lunacy that will make you wonder if the staff is secretly taking anything in the back room (ie the Mad Mod episode). Plus season 1's underlying subplot involving Slade (voiced expertly by Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman) is as dark and driven as anything in the Batman shows. The only time this show falls flat for me is when it puts stylized action over story essentials, which some of the early episodes here fall into.

Again, this set collects material that WB has already released. I think even the bulk of the bonus features have been carried over. I'm hoping this was a sudden shift in WB's animation-on-dvd strategy as opposed to milking the consumer with re-releases, as the single discs were already quite generous in their own way. A great consideration if you haven't purchased the old discs yet, great for kids but adults should find some amusement too.",1135209600,53,1397,4.8655462184873945
2462466,4,B000CEXFZG,"First off, a note: People are WAY too impatient for friggin JL sets. There's a whole laundry list of reasons why JL hasn't been released yet, but I don't want to go into it now. We know they're coming, just calm down and be patient. Sheesh.

Since I missed the first two releases, I'll definately be picking this up (thank the heavens that it's in an Amaray case!), as I really enjoy the show. The animation and fight choreography are some of the best I've ever seen from ANY animated work, though the producers haven't quite perfected using the anime look (though that'll get fixed by Season 2.5/Season 3). The music is awesome, especially the theme, and the stories are very entertaining while still being engaging. Really, there are few cartoons on the air as good as Teen Titans, and considering the show got canned to make way for Leigon of Superheroes, this is a good, inexpensive way to relive the past.

Just wish we could get some commentaries and have it under the ""DC Classic Collection"" like Batman/Superman/Batman Beyond/JL so we could get some nicer extras.",1133308800,16,1071,4.721925133689839
2462467,5,B000CEXFZG,"My kids (and to some extent myself) happen to like the Teen Titans animated series.  Though I prefer the 90's Batman Animated Series, Titans is nice in that it doesn't take itself too seriously.

My biggest problem isn't with the show, but with Warner Brothers' standard business practice of making you buy the same episodes of your favorite WB TV shows more than once in the guise of ""testing the waters"" with DVDs containg only a couple to a few episodes.  They did it with Babylon 5, both the 90s and 2000s Batman animated series', the Superman animated series, and now they're doing it with Teen Titans (and Justice League, which I hear is finally going to season sets in 2006).

I'm glad WB seems to be finally getting the message.  In the case of this TT season set, though, it's a little too late for me.

I would say get this one if you haven't bought the other two discs with the same episodes - it will reinforce the message to the powers-that-be at Warner.",1133222400,23,967,4.465909090909091

When I saw this was released on Blu-ray, I know I had to purchase and I was not disappointed. The show looks incredible and is as fun as it ever was.",1521072000,,249,3.9019607843137254
2462501,5,B000CEXFZG,"I absolutely love the Teen Titans series and am a long time fan of practically all DC animated series. I have never purchased the DVD of the Teen Titans because I always want blu ray versions (just a pet peeve of mine).

2462503,5,B000CEXFZG,"I am glad to see they released this and well done as well. I noticed people complaining about the episode order being out of order. They are not out of order, it all depends on how you want them ordered. On this Blu-Ray set, they are ordered in the order that they were aired on TV is all. Instead of being in production order, they are ordered by the dates as they were aired on TV. Get over it and be glad they gave it to us at all. Just play them in the order you want from the list if its that big of bother to anyone.

Personally I think the video and audio are well done for this release and I hope to get the rest of the seasons as well.",1519776000,2,644,3.8421052631578947

2462507,2,B000CEXFZG,"Unfortunately I have to give this a bad review. The episodes are out of order, and there's no good reason that they should be on this bluray. I'll still give it an extra star because the audio and video presentations are nice. But I own all the dvd's for this show already, and I'm not dying to upgrade to a bluray that isn't overall better in every aspect. And just fyi, the original episode order should be:

1  ""Divide and Conquer""
2  ""Sisters""
3  ""Final Exam""
4  ""Forces of Nature""
5  ""The Sum of His Parts""

2462508,3,B000CEXFZG,"I rated this a 3 because As much as I love the Teen Titans... whoever made the dics got a couple of episodes out of order... first off Final Exams was supposed to be episode 2, sisters is supposed to be episode 3 and Divide and Conquer was supposed to be the first episode on the list... this really upsets me!!!! I mean how hard is it to get the episodes in order?!?!?!? I mean this is the blu-ray its supposed to be an upgrade... even the SD version had the episodes in the right order...",1518220800,4,490,4.114583333333333
2462509,5,B000CEXFZG,"Excellent video quality.  I was afraid that the Blu-ray would not be that much better than the DVD, but it is much, MUCH better.  Sharper, more vivid, more enjoyable as a result.  Also, the aspect ratio is now full screen (16:9) as opposed to 4:3, as originally released on DVD. So it's win, win, win!  If your a fan, this is a good purchase.  Hopefully, the remaining seasons will be released in like manner.",1517875200,3,409,4.472972972972973
2462510,5,B000CEXFZG,"I stumbled upon this on amazon not even knowing a Blu-ray version was coming out. Having been a childhood fan, I decided to buy this excellent piece of nostalgia. I am incredibly impressed with the quality of this release! It has not only been completely remastered in true Blu-ray HD quality, but it runs very smoothly with a full widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9! The audio quality is also excellent, so definitely worth a purchase! If you enjoyed watching this how as a kid, then do your children a favor and let them grow up to quality television, not the cheap crap that CN, Nickelodeon, and Disney channel put out these days. I will definitely be picking up the following seasons as they release! This is the start of my DC TV Cartoon Blu-ray collection.",1517616000,6,759,4.62962962962963

2462512,5,B000CEXFZG,"At a glance this latest release of the first season of the original Teen Titans appears to be a simple cash grab, (they didn't even change the cover art from the Dvd release) but I am happy, even excited to say that this impression is absolutely wrong. Laziness on the cover and opening menu aside this release looks GREAT on blu ray. I didn't even need to put my old dvds in to know but that didn't stop me  from comparing the two and this release blows the last one clear out of the water, worth every penny to a fan. While season 1 may not be the strongest season in the series it's still really good and if this one sells well more will surely follow. All said and done I for one am very impressed by this release.",1517011200,13,718,4.128571428571429

2462514,5,B000CEXFZG,"Watching TEEN TITANS in true 1080p HD is like watching the show again for the first time. Really hopeful that DC continues with the release of the entire series in HD!

I love this show, and as a 17 year old, still love it to this day! Im so happy its on Blu Ray, but I REALLY need the whole series on Blu Ray already!!! HURRY UP, WB!!
Sound is loud and clear, and picture is crisp, beautiful remaster! Hopefully with enough purchases, we may get a season 6, if Young Justice can comeback, as well as Samurai Jack, why not the Titans we grew up with?",1516665600,6,571,4.107142857142857
2462516,5,B000CEXFZG,"Note: The show was made in the 16:9 aspect ratio (this is the version on the Blu-Ray) but was cut to 4:3 on Cartoon Network and for the DVDs.

Watch Teen Titans now in HD and in Widescreen too. Teen Titans has never looked this good. The episodes are in the order they first aired on TV which  is different from the DVDs.

My nephew was first introduced to the cast of the show from watching Teen Titans Go. Being that the latter series is full of gags, I thought it would be appropriate to open his eyes to a whole new realm in which I've explored as a child myself. I already knew what to expect from the show before I bought it. When the show aired on Cartoon Network and later Boomerang, I had the opportunity to re-watch the show dozens of times. There are so many memorable episodes in this series that I still remember them as an adult. Teen Titans is one of the best animated action shows to ever air on television.

2462653,5,B000CEXFZG,"like Teen Titans. It's a very different take on the DC characters than Batman, Superman, and Justice League, and there are obvious anime influences in the fight scenes and gags. What's nice about the series is that while it generally writes towards a younger audience, it's never so simplistic that it alienates the older crowd. The chemistry between the five leads is great, and there are occasional moments of lunacy that will make you wonder if the staff is secretly taking anything in the back room (ie the Mad Mod episode). Plus season 1's underlying subplot involving Slade (voiced expertly by Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman) is as dark and driven as anything in the Batman shows. The only time this show falls flat for me is when it puts stylized action over story essentials, which some of the early episodes here fall into.

Again, this set collects material that WB has already released. I think even the bulk of the bonus features have been carried over. I'm hoping this was a sudden shift in WB's animation-on-dvd strategy as opposed to milking the consumer with re-releases, as the single discs were already quite generous in their own way. A great consideration if you haven't purchased the old discs yet, great for kids but adults should find some amusement too.",1473638400,,1268,4.84331797235023

2462661,5,B000CEXFZG,"Excellent series which is based on the New Teen Titans comic book series of the early to mid-1980's. Although it is sillier and funnier than than the comic books on which it is based it is an excellently produced homage to the original material. Lots of fun to watch but if you are expecting this cartoon to be identical to the comic books on which it was based you will be disappointed.

The recurring arc running through this season is a rivalry between Robin and Slade (known in the comic books as Deathstroke).

I also spoke about this season on my podcast: Dave Talks Comics

My favorite episodes from this season are:

2 - Sisters - Starfire gets an unexpected visit from her sister, Blackfire
5 - The Sum of His Parts - After his battery fails Cyborg gets some help from Fixit who wants to do more than just recharge his battery
6 - Nevermore - Beast Boy and Cyborg struggle to escape from Raven's mind after getting transported there accidentally
7 - Switched - Raven and Starfire have to save the boys (Robin, Cyborg, Beast Boy) from the Puppet King after he attempts to steal their bodies
10 & 11 - Apprentice Parts 1 & 2 - Slade lures the Teen Titans into a trap in the climax of his ongoing rivalry with Robin",1471478400,4,1221,4.389380530973451

As the description states, there are two disks that house the thirteen episodes of the first season. If I had to pick out a couple favorites from this season, I would have to say ""Nevermore,"" ""Switched,"" ""Masks,"" and ""Detention,"" but honestly, I like them all!

The package itself came in good time and condition.

Episodes on disks:

Now to rant on about Amazon's crappy Instant Video Service. First off I have a Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation it only has 8 GB on it witch means by the time all the necessary stuff takes up it's room you only have about 4 GB left, it can't hold full seasons of a tv show. Sure make it a format that only kindles can play but at least let my copy my files onto my Wireless flash drive so I'm not consuming half of my memory space! If the kindles had a micro SD card port there wouldn't be any problem.",1403827200,,741,4.110344827586207

2463050,5,B000CEXFZG,"I'm an adult and I got this for myself, I had seen some of the episodes on the WB Saturday morning on cable, and from the first episode I thought wow this is really good! Every thing about this show is just done right from the animation to the heroes themselves you will have no problems knowing who is who as each one has their own independent personal quirks and problems which helps make the team and the show so good, the best thing about it is it's not your typical super hero show defeat the bad Guy with might comes right and repeat over and over! This show is very quirky and down right goofy at times and serious when it needs to be (it is very kid friendly) even the theme music is cool, if you are looking for serious super hero action then don't buy this but if you are looking for a flat out good time for you and the whole family to enjoy this is it!!

2463072,5,B000CEXFZG,"These ""original"" Teen Titans episodes are the best - great villains, good storylines, and even the humor was handled very nicely.

2463091,5,B000CEXFZG,I started watching this show in 2003 at the age of 12 when this aired along with my 7 year old sister. Ten years later and now ages 22 and 17 we have recently rediscovered this on Boomerang (making us feel a little old after remembering these episodes airing originally). We love this show and we have seen the new short animated series and have had a few chuckles with it. It is nice to have all the episodes on DVD and not have to stay up late on Mon-Fri. The only minor quibble is the day I went to go buy the complete series (for my sister's birthday) all together the price was raised at least $10 from what it was when I checked it two days before. I decided to buy the seasons individually and in the process this saved me some money. I advise all who think of buying the complete series to double/triple check as I did. I'll post this on the complete series page to give a head's up to other buyers.,1381968000,,907,4.129943502824859

2463096,5,B000CEXFZG,I have never enjoyed Teen Titans like this. I can sit down and relax at home and play my favorite episodes without commercial breaks or anything. This show I used to love when I was younger and I still do. The episodes are great and timeless. It's a very fun show to watch with the family and I promise I will be buying the second season soon. The price was amazing also! I'm just glad that Cartoon Network is releasing every single one of their shows on Blu-ray and DVD. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!,1376352000,,491,4.3478260869565215
2463097,5,B000CEXFZG,"I love this show.  All 3 of my children (ages 7 to 17) love this show.  It's got a carnivore and vegetarian getting along.  The carnivore is at times abrupt and maybe even insensitive about the vegetarian's life choice, but the vegetarian talks about it and they move forward as close friends.  This is much like real life, from my experiences.  This show has a bubbly personality (preppie?) girl hanging out with a restrained, serious personality (goth?) girl.  They learn about each other and come to respect each other's way of being, while still embracing their own choices.  If only we could all learn these lessons!  Religion is also hinted at, since Raven meditates and chants daily, whereas the others do not.  There are strong female roles and a strong black role, in other words, gender and race are a non-issue overall.  Racial issues are addressed in one episode in an unexpected way having nothing to do with the one person of color (not sure if that was in season 1 though). All seasons are great.  I highly recommend this show to anyone with kids and to adults who like comics and animation.  It is really a show about different types of people coming together to work and live harmoniously towards mutual goals.",1376265600,,1227,4.708920187793427
2463098,5,B000CEXFZG,"Funny, exciting, enjoyable by kids and adults alike. Animation is quite good and Slade is an interesting villain that has some depth to him.",1376265600,,140,4.875

2463111,5,B000CEXFZG,My son is four and he loves this show! I was so happy when he graduated to this kind of show instead of Bubble Guppies. I don't mind watching this with him at all actually some of the story lines pull me in!,1371081600,,207,3.8372093023255816
2463112,5,B000CEXFZG,"I saw a clip of this show at a store, & it looked great so I naturally got this season to try.  And it was really good.  My fifth favorite DC show, after Justice League, Batman, Superman & Batman Beyond.  I know that people deny it takes place in the same continuity but I believe it does.  I like to think that this is what Tim Drake was doing on the side.  Here's a review of every episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1.  Divide and Conquer:  The Titans' attempt to stop Cinderblock from breaking into prison goes awry when Robin and Cyborg's ""Sonic Boom"" tag-team maneuver backfires and Cinderblock escapes with a quarantined villain, Plasmus.  A fierce argument between Robin and Cyborg ensues, and causes Cyborg to announce his decision to quit the team. But as the team begins to fall apart, a mysterious villain takes advantage of the split by sending Plasmus to eliminate the Titans.  This is a great start to the series.  A

2.  Sisters:  Starfire is suddenly attacked by some alien device sent to capture ""the tamaranian girl"".  After a victory against it, the Titans go back home, to find Starfire's sister Blackfire there. Starfire feels that she is being replaced by her as a Teen Titan.  A good focus on Starfire. A-

3.  Final Exam:  The super-villain training academy known as H.I.V.E. Academy presents three of its finest cadets - Jinx, Mammoth, and Gizmo - for their first mission: to beat the Teen Titans. They succeeded in two attacks, in which Robin - the group's leader - goes missing in the aftermath of the first, and the second forces the Rest of the Group - Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, and Beast Boy from their home of Titan's Tower.  Without their home and their leader, will they be able to fight back after this loss?  An excellent episode.  A+

4.  Forces of Nature:  The two teenage brothers Thunder and Lightning roam the town looking for fun.  Unfortunately, their idea of fun is wrecking everything in sight, regardless of those being injured in the process.  Meanwhile, after a prank intended for Cyborg is accidentally pulled on Starfire, Beast Boy has to deal with the repercussions of his actions and earn her forgiveness.  A good episode despite the heavy-handed moral.  B

5.  The Sum of His Parts:  While playing football in the park, Cyborg suddenly shuts down.  After rebooting, he tells the other Titans that his batteries are dying and requires recharging, but doesn't get the chance, because the nefarious Mumbo is causing havoc in Jump City.  While facing him down, Cyborg's emergency batteries die, and his inert body falls down into the underground depths of a junkyard.  The Titans believe Mumbo has kidnapped him, but he has instead been found by a strange machine called Fixit, who doesn't share Cyborg's views of humanity.  Instead, he believes it to be a flawed part of Cyborg's biology- one that he intends to correct, with or without Cyborg's consent.  Cyborg is my favorite Titan, & this was an excellent focus on him.  A+

6.  Nevermore:  During a battle with Dr. Light, Raven loses control of her powers, which makes the Titans worried.  Later, Beast Boy and Cyborg sneak into Raven's room and Beast Boy discovers a strange-looking mirror, which sucks him and Cyborg into alternate realm where they meet different sides of Raven.  Unbeknownst to them, they've stumbled upon a portal into Raven's mind, where extremely terrifying thoughts and threats are waiting for them deep within.  A great focus on Raven.  A

7.  Switched:  The Puppet King traps the souls of Robin, Cyborg and Beast Boy and takes control of their bodies.  While trying the same on Starfire and Raven, he fails, but their souls switch into each other's bodies and they'll have to learn how to use the other's powers and work together to save their friends before the Puppet King enacts a wicked ceremony that will destroy them.  The worst episode of the season.  It's not terrible, but the plot has been done to death.  C

8.  Deep Six:  A mysterious new villain called Trident appears and starts stealing nuclear waste from ships.  The Titans go to investigate and meet a new hero, Aqualad, that teams up to help them fight Trident.  Unfortunately, while Starfire and Raven fawn over his looks, Beast Boy and Aqualad start to fight about who is better.  Aqualad was always one of my favorite DC sidekicks, & this episode does him justice.  A

9.  Masks:  The Titans soon discover that Slade is up to his old tricks, and that he wants more technology.  Robin isolates himself more and more from the team.  Out of nowhere a new villain appears, and goes by the name Red-X.  He knows all the titans' weaknesses and takes them down in a clean sweep.  However he also saves Beastboy from being hit by a train and that causes some suspicion.  A strong character-based episode.  A

10.  Detention:  Mysteriously ambushed and knocked out cold, the Titans wake to find themselves in the hands of Mad Mod who has decided that the Titans are misbehaving children who need to go back to school.  He says he'll teach them a lesson they won't forget, a lesson which includes hypnosis, brainwashing, and dangerous school materials.  This is an incredibly hilarious episode that is quite possibly the funniest DC Animated episode I have ever seen.  A+

11.  Car:  Cyborg has finally finished his 'baby', the T-Car.  But after a battle with Overload his car disappears.  It successively ends up in the hands of two punks called Cash and Sammy, and eventually Gizmo, then Overload, the last of which forces Cyborg to make a painful choice.  Another great focus on Cyborg.  A

12-13.  Apprentice:  Slade threatens to use a Chronoton Detonator, a device which can destroy the entire city if triggered by freezing time forever.  While Robin goes after Slade, and learns Slade's true plans.  The detonator was just a front for something much darker, and it now threatens the rest of the team from the inside out, unless Robin agrees to Slade's every command.  An excellent season finale.  A+

This show was a lot better than I expected it to be.  I thought it would just be funny, but while indeed there some hilarious moments, there was also a surprising amount of emphasis placed on characterization, & when you combine the 2 you have a real winner on your hands.",1369872000,,6276,4.75

2463124,5,B000CEXFZG,"First and Foremost Teen Titans is a DC comic Series that came out in the 60's. It was extremely popular which made Warner Brothers interested in starting a show. Many characters, scenarios and themes were drawn from the 1980s DC Comics series The New Teen Titans. The Show started in 2003 and it was an instant success story! People of all ages watch the Teen Titans because it is an amazing show and has deeper meanings. People may assume that the show is generated towards the younger audience but they are wrong. The progression and deeper themes of the show widened the appeal to a much broader audience. The show really gets into darker storylines and they expand on much more characters. So basically the show evolves with audience. All the episodes in the First Season are amazing. My two favorite episodes in particular is the 2 part Season Finale called the Apprentice. That's just my opinion, you should really check out this show even if your not a comic fan.

Here's a list of the First Season Episodes
1. Final Exam
2. Sisters
3. Divide and Conquer
4. Forces of Nature
5. The Sum of his Parts
6. Nevermore
7. Switched
8. Deep Six
9. Masks
10. Mad Mod

This season in particular is good, definitely not as intense or epic as some of the later ones, but if you want to capture this show in it's essence this is the season to buy. Another thing, i don't believe you necessarily have to watch the seasons in order because most episodes in a season do not link to one another, and any story points you don't know will probably be explained anyway.

My only real problem is with the animation style, while the characters are always well drawn the enviroments tend to be bland and repetitive.

2463163,4,B000CEXFZG,"Enjoyable, fun season of superhero action and melodrama, and arguably a refreshing alternative to the grim & gritty doings of other animated shows.

Why ""arguably""?  Well, the heavy manga/anime influence, with its exclamation points appearing over characters' heads and characters eyes bugging out when they're surprised (and other frequent exaggerated flourishes) takes some getting used to, as does the more simplistic, cartoony look of the characters themselves.  But all that is eventually kind of cute once you get used to it.  And it doesn't take away from the drama and action, which is generous and well done in these thirteen episodes.  Having said that, though, I think I still prefer my serious superhero fare to be more consistently, well... serious.  But, again, the occasional goofiness on display is not a dealbreaker, by any means.

I do mourn the waning of worldwide fascination with all things American in popular culture in recent years, though.  Time was, everyone loved American cities, American music, American everything in the TV shows and movies we exported to a happily-waiting world.  Now, in shows like ""Teen Titans"" (and the recent film ""Speed Racer"", for example), the stories are set in bland,  nondescript cities that could be located anywhere in the world, and with zero references to the many fun aspects of life in the U.S.A.

Obviously, more and more entertainment is produced nowadays in a way that makes it look like it might be taking place wherever that entertainment product is being exported.  So, fun shows or not, it's kind of sad that the only obviously ""American"" moment in these thirteen episodes was a brief scene set in front of a drive-up burger joint.

Anyway, enough of that rant.  I guess I have to accept the brave new world of homogenous entertainment product.  And these episodes, as stated at the outset, are undeniably entertaining on many levels.  I like how we jump right into the world of the Titans with nary an origin story in sight (for the team as a whole or for its individual members), with information about the characters only dispensed as we need it.  Both the individual episodes with various villains and the season-long ""Slade"" arc (which rears its head here and there throughout the season and comes to a head in the last two episodes) are pleasing and involving.

Extras include a half-hour or so piece where we hear from the creative forces behind the comic book and the show, and shorter companion pieces covering the voice actors and other aspects of the series.  All are very interesting (the show's creators, by the way, don't mention any directive to downplay the American locale of the Titans, only that they decided to bow to an overall Japanese flavor and style because the show was being animated in Japan... taking advantage of the animators' strengths and all).  The interview with the Japanese girl band who sung the show's theme song went on a bit long, though.

Hey, despite the gripes, this was an enjoyable batch of shows and I think I'll pick up the second season.  I'll report back if it continues the downplaying and watering down of all things American, though.  And if it does, I'll try not to be grumpy about it.",1226448000,,3210,4.89279112754159
2463164,5,B000CEXFZG,"Back when I was a teenager, one of my favorite comic books was The New Teen Titans which was written and drawn by Marv Wolfman & George Perez for DC Comics. The cartoon series is based, primarily, on those stories. The series features Robin, Raven, Starfire, Cyborg, and Beast Boy & focuses on the troubles of these five being superheroes. Very character and story-driven, the Titans face off against Slade and his assortment of baddies in the first season. Special features include: the 'Finding their voices' featurette, Toon Topia bonus cartoons, Puffy Ami Yumi featurette and music video, & Comic Creations: From Comic Book To Cartoon. There's even trailers for other cartoon series produced by Warner Animation. Vocal talent is provided by: Scott Menville, Tara Strong(who some of you remember as Batgirl), Khary Payton, Hynden Walch, Greg Cipes, and Ron Perlman.

I really didn't think I'd like this first season of Teen Titans(after I'd seen Teen Titans:Trouble in Tokyo- I figured the show was alot like that) but I like it. It definitely keeps in time with stories from the book even though the animation is heavily anime influenced. Course, I give it props for being different than anything else out there. It's a shame that Cartoon Network cancelled the series after its' fifth season. It was appealing to both children & adults alike.

With that said, my sister told me (sheepishly) that she was hooked on this show with HER son. She would laugh saying that she was probably the only adult who knew the words to the theme song. Well, now there are two!

These episodes are great for all ages. There is enough comedy for kids with pranks and what-not, but the animators also created something for adults to enjoy as well.

You see how 5 teenagers with all of their gifts and powers come together to fight evil. You see them win and lose, and how to deal with it.

ROBIN - the ringleader with no powers has to rely on strength of mind and muscle.

CYBORG - half human, half robot has super strength due to his robotics, yet is still a person.

RAVEN- her emotions can easily control her powers, so she is constantly struggling to keep them balanced. She is your dark mysterious teenager.

BEAST BOY - can turn into any animal (including T-Rex), and is the comedic relief throughout season 1. (Are we getting our butts kicked, or is it just me?)

STAR FIRE - Alien who can whip out fire from her hands and can fly, is very endearingly innocent on the surface, who clumsily tries to fit in. You start to see that there is more to her than meets the eye when you see the episode Sisters.

We are buying the second season for our kids for Christmas this year. They can't stand the cliff hanger on the last episode of season 1!",1163030400,7,1501,4.223776223776224

2463187,4,B000CEXFZG,"Teen Titans: The Complete First Season is one of the best animated DVD series I've seen.  It's one of the best DC animated shows out there.  What I feel made Teen Titans a great first season is the content of each episode.  Each episode was aimed not only for children, nor just for adults.  Teen Titans dealt with real teen issues and really were a family instead of a team. The writing showed each team member having strong feelings for the other.  The common plot of finding out who Slade really is was the overall theme for season one.  A theme which came on really strong towards the last two episodes. I really liked how Robin was the strongest member of the Teen Titans.  He really came out of the traditional Robin sidekick image and emerged as a main star in the DCU.  Much like the Tim Drake/Robin is doing in the comics.  Robin is no longer just a sidekick.  He kicks [...] in this season and shows it can be ROBIN and Batman.  Robin was really given his justice.  I always founght Robin in Batman: the Animated series was kind of a push over and seemed weak.  Robin in Teen Titans is the complete opposite.  Robin is gung ho no holds barred.  The animated fight scenes are some of the best.  Right up there with JLU.  The rest of the characters are awesome.  Starfire seems kind of childish in comparison to the rest of the team.  I guess that's the alien in her.  I feel the strongest episodes are Apprentice Part I and II.  I really liked when Slade mentions to Robin he could be a father figure.  Robin simply replies "" I already have a father""  next scene is a fade to black with bats coming at you.  Sweet!!!!  The final fight scene with Robin against the rest of the Teen Titans on top of a familiar building (you only see a few letters, but can make out it's Wayne Enterprises) was the best fight of the series.  Overall this series rocks and if you like any of the DCU animated shows then pick this up.  I only gave it 4 stars because the slight Japanese anime influence with the facial expressions gets kind of annoying.  other then that...highly recommended.

2463190,5,B000CEXFZG,"Normally I scoff at any attempts to merge American styles of animation with Japanese anime elements, however, Teen Titans is one of the few shows that overcomes this normally debilitating fusion. I'm not saying that I like the mixture, but the heart of the show shines beyond its limitations of style.

The program is suitable for children and adults, and although the stories and characters deviate a great deal from the comic series, if you take it at face value I think you can enjoy the show for what it is. If you are an avid fan of the comics you may be disappointed.

At the end of the day I think that Season 1 is a great buy for the price, and a godsend that Cartoon Network finally began to release the show by season. Unfortunately, however, this show was cancelled long before its time. Thankfully though we can continue to enjoy it as it is released on DVD.",1142035200,4,870,4.43125

To bad they are cancelled now. . . <cryz> was such a good show.",1141948800,,265,3.75
2463192,4,B000CEXFZG,"First of all, let me say that the term ""boxed set"" for this collection is a misnomer.  It is a two disc collection in a plastic ""clam shell"" style case.  It is a more durable storage device than the previous cardboard offerings and for that alone, I would applaud this release if nothing else.

Second, as has been mentioned, there is little to no new material on this release.  It is quite simply the first two Teen Titans DVDs (Teen Titans Volume 1: Divide and Conquer and Teen Titans Volume 2: Switched) repackaged into a new format.  There have been complaints by some saying that Warner Brothers is merely trying to get more money by doing this.  I disagree since there are people like me who refused to purchase the previous releases in the hopes that this series would eventually be released in a more durable and economical format than the aforementioned volumes.  I do not know about anyone else, but I really do not like the cardboard cases for DVDs.  I find the opening mechanism to be annoying and when I lend out a DVD in that type of casing, it rarely returns to me undamaged.  Furthermore, this two disc set is cheaper than buying the two individual volumes.  This is a perfect way to get the Titans series if you have not already purchased the original releases.

As for the cartoon itself, I enjoy it very much.  The first season of the Titans was, in my opinion, the weakest but it was still very well done.  The animation style was lighthearted and fun and the stories were told in a fashion to appeal to a younger audience in the elementary school/pre-teen age range rather than the high school/college target audience for the Batman/Superman/Justice League/Justice League Unlimited animated series by Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and the rest of the gang.  There have been comments from people who do not like the over-the-top stylings of the animation or the anime influence.  There are people who say that the animators did not really ""get"" anime and that it is a poor imitation.  I disagree with both types of comments.  My main complaint about the first season was that the characterizations and plots were not as tight as subsequent seasons.  You could tell that the writers were still finding their voices and trying to figure out the team dynamic.  Still, for the most part the first season is entertaining if you like action oriented animation with a buttered popcorn sort of humor.

I have watched a great deal of anime, and yes there is anime influence, in particular from the style of FLCL (definitely *not* a children's anime by the way so do not show FLCL to your child before watching it yourself to see if you approve of it).  People who say that there is something to ""get"" from the stylings that TT is using are overinflating the genre.  Teen Titans was simply exploring new ways to express ideas and emotional responses.  Rather than using the same old takes and shots that are standard in American cartoons, TT might shrink the characters down to a smaller, younger ""chibi-style"" and over-extend the emotive aspects.  This actually goes quite well with the teenaged aspect of the show, since as a teenager, emotions often run high and dramatics become more pronounced.

All in all, I would highly recommend this collection and hope that more collections of this type occur in the future.",1140739200,8,3320,4.70242214532872
2463193,4,B000CEXFZG,"I'll admit, I wasn't feeling particularly hopeful for ""Teen Titans"" when I saw the first previews.  We were already seeing quite a few animated shows copying the style of Japanese animation as it became more popular.  So it was a very pleasant suprise when I found that ""Teen Titans"" not only featured a much deeper understanding of the workings of anime, but also focused on top notch voice acting and character centered storytelling.  It took them an episode or two to really find their footing, but once they did, ""Teen Titans"" was one of the best shows on television, and later seasons only improved on what had been set up.  I can see how the use of the more cartoony aspects of anime - super-deformed characters, anime inspired wild takes, and the like - might turn some people off, but do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes.  Once you get used to the style, you'll start seeing the storytelling that kept fans of the show coming back.

The four star rating (as opposed to five) is largely because of the special features.  There are two ""Making Of"" documentaries with the voice actors and show creators, which are pretty good.  There's the fun music video of the theme song.  The interview with Japanese songsters Puffy Ami Yumi is fun, but a little too long, and the device of having the Titans ""conduct the interview"" is pretty lame.  The short two part cartoon, ""The Hiro's"" (yes, I know that apostrophe doesn't belong there, but that's how they spell it) is rather bad and unfunny.  But the biggest problem is something that's left off the DVD, namely commentary.  WB has been notoriously slow to recognize how much fans want episode commentary, with only 3 to 4 commentaries on the Batman and Superman DVDs.  Commentray with cast and crew for ""Teen Titans"" would have been great.  But despite a somewhat small set of special features, ""Teen Titans - Season One"" is deifinitely worth picking up.",1139961600,34,1913,4.7057057057057055
2463194,5,B000CEXFZG,"As a fan of the Batman and Superman animated series I didn't quite know what to expect from Teen Titans. I had heard that there was a serious anime vibe to it (even more so than ""The Batman"" which is also available.)

If you approach the series thinking it's going to be light, fun, and not at all serious then you will have a blast. The ""Mad Mod"" episode is one of the funniest bits of animation I've seen in a long time.",1139616000,4,422,4.0843373493975905
2463195,5,B000CEXFZG,"This is how a DVD box set should be done, and really you wish you'd see more cartoon DVD sets handled like this one.

Teen Titans - The Complete First Season has the episodes  of season 1 (duh) and some nice extras, like interviews of the cast, looking at how the show was developed from the comics, stuff like that. There are even some extras that are hidden, like a Mad Mod music video sung by Hynden Walch (the actress who does the VA for starfire) and others asking the cast who their favorite villain or what their favorite gadget from the show is. The episodes are even in the order the show was supposed to air (before CN changed  the line-up a li'l) which actually works for the show.

The menus are really easy to navigate through, and has a really nice blue tech-influenced style (for lack of better words.) Occasionally, the volume in the different segments like the extras will be lower or higher, which is a bit odd, but not so much that it's barely audible one segment and then blasting the next. Just a notch or two difference.

If you're a fan of the TV series, you'll enjoy this set, and even if you haven't watched the series but are DC comic fans or just like super hero type shows, you'll enjoy this series.",1139529600,7,1227,4.364035087719298
2463196,2,B000CEXFZG,"When this show first came out I was hoping for something like the other DC properties that had preceded it in recent years like Batman and Superman TAS, and JLA.

Man, was I disappointed.

This series is about as far removed from those earlier works as you can get.  Now, I realize that Teen Titans was supposed to be a bit more light-hearted but it goes so far in that direction that is just becomes painful to watch.  I could have lived with the different art style and stories that weren't quite so serious.  But, in the end, everything was just poorly done.  Take a look at Static Shock.  That series was clearly aimed at a younger audience.  Occasionally you could gag on the PSA-style plots but at least they remained watch-able.  With Teen Titans, I couldn't help but cringe each time they tried to use some anime device.  (and failed each time)  You really get the impression that the animators were trying to copy anime style without really understanding it.  And the theme song...I'm not going to say it's bad...but it's definitely irritating.  Listen to it just once and it WILL be drilled into your mind for the rest of eternity.  I'll admit that this line-up of the team was never my favorite.  However, after watching a few episodes of the series, all I can say is that I'm glad they used these characters and didn't butcher any that I really liked.",1139443200,6,1363,4.551440329218107
2463197,5,B000CEXFZG,"Teen Titans is not Batman: the Animated Series or Justice League, nor does it attempt to be like other fully grown adult superhero shows. Don't get me wrong, I love BTAS. But Teen Titans with its Anime influences and stress on adolescent issues takes a very different approach at crime fighting from previous DC shows.

Right off the bat you're going to love or hate this show. Some people complain that Teen Titans is a cheap imitation of Japanese animation. In my opinion, the Anime styles allow the show to take on a unique style that distinguishes itself from other shows. It allows the characters to get stretchy or ""Chibified"" when things get sarcastically funny or enables them to show great emotion during a time of stress.

Try to compare and contrast BTAS to Teen Titans without saying one is superior to another. BTAS was made to be ""dark"" from the start. Since BTAS is centered on only one hero, primarily Batman, it draws story potential from the supporting cast of characters, primarily villains. The stories are grim ones about tragic characters that spiral downward into criminal activity. Fans will remember the emotional depth perceived in the origin of characters such as Mr. Freeze and Clayface.

In contrast, Teen Titans focuses its character development on the heroes. With five juveniles on the team there is plenty of room for conflict and interaction. The villains primarily exist to be obstacles that bring in a lot of butt kicking action in the fight scenes. (Robin often makes a point of stressing the need to put them in jail after the villains are defeated) The conflicts in Teen Titans are generally two faced: the bad guys get busted but at the same time the heroes learn their lesson in a particular episode.

BTAS successfully created an alternate 40's for Gotham City where its always nighttime. But of course, it wouldn't be Gotham City if it wasn't always drawn in ""Dark Deco"" looks with shadows everywhere and nocturnal action, not to mention having the streets stalked by a vigilante who dresses like the devil himself. Batman is supposed to be scary. The Titans are not.

Teen Titans also breaks through with new living headquarters for DC superheroes. Set in an alternate 60's in a fictional West Coast City, there's an element of wackiness and fun that you can feel from the minute all heck breaks loose. The Titans don't fight mobsters and bank robbers. They get shot with laser beams and alien plasma instead of regular bullets. They live in a giant T-shaped tower on an island that's flooded with sunshine. And without secret identities, they live, eat, and sleep in their uniforms.

This allows them to work on crime fighting 24/7 instead of needing to create dual lifestyles as the mutant teens did in ""X-Men Evolution"". Like ordinary teenagers, the Titans fight over pizza, the remote, and the bathroom. The show takes a spin on typical school bullies with the menacing but determined HIVE students that continue to bother the Titans throughout the show. In the third episode (first one aired on Cartoon Network) entitled ""Final Exam"" the HIVE agents kick the Titans out of their home and declare victory by wearing their clothes and throwing out their CDs.

The first season starts off slightly choppy but the second episode certainly delivers the goods. In ""Sisters,"" we are faced with the typical scenario of sibling rivalry set in a superhero yet slightly familiar and neurotic environment that teenagers face. The episode focuses on the somewhat bumbling but adorable alien known as Starfire. Her older sister Blackfire, who unexpectedly comes into town, suddenly eclipses her in every way that an older sister can. A chase among invading alien drones carries on until the Titans suspect that the seemingly superior Blackfire may be hiding something.

Some of the episodes are just so bizarre and the Anime influences that allow physical gags can make you choke up or break up with laughter. In ""Mad Mod"" a British-talking teacher gone wild throws the Titans into a giant booby-trapped school. The entire episode is a hilarious chase that includes optical illusions, exploding beakers and hypno-screens. It shows how far around the bend this show can get but also an exercise of creativity and amusement.

This is not to say that all of the villains are silly guys. If Batman has Joker and Superman has Lex Luthor, then the Titans have Slade (known as Deathstroke the Terminator in the comics) as their number one arch-nemesis. Ron Perlman does for Slade what Kevin Conroy does for Batman, so its no wonder that Slade is called the ""anti-Batman"" of this show. BTAS fans will remember his gruff tone he used as Clayface but Perlman switches it to a dark, sleek, and sinister voice for Robin's number one enemy. He's instantly become one of the coolest animated villains around, a usually calm and controlled mastermind with a psychopath personality. Slade's villainous genius comes from his ability to manipulate the Titans on a psychological level.

Its not wonder that the first season's finale is based on Robin, giving that he's constantly being considered a sidekick by most pop culture associates. Batman does not make a cameo in this show and isn't even mentioned by name. (Though there are a few nods to Gotham and other DC references allowing the Teen Titans to exist in the same universe as the Dark Knight.)  But now Robin in essence becomes the ""Batman"" of his team, the serious leader who takes his challenges in strides.  His best friend Starfire is deeply concerned with his fanatic nature that is revealed in the episode ""Masks"" when Robin, unknowingly to his teammates, dons the mask of a criminal called Red X to track down Slade. The episode ends on a darker note when Robin's plan backfires and his friends are angry at his mistrust. This is a definite risk-taking chance instead of delivering a happy ending after a 22 minute episode.

For over 60 years now, his partner has bailed Robin out of trouble. But as the leader of his own team, Robin now faces a terrible dilemma that he must sort out without the help of Batman. The two-part finale ""Apprentice"" is worth watching again and again as Robin's obsessions with justice lead him further away from his friends and into a cat-and-mouse game with Slade. The Boy Wonder is finally blackmailed and forced to betray his friends to save their lives. I won't give away the ending, but the finale certainly takes credit for giving one of the best original stories of the show. This season finale sums up what this show is all about: adolescent maturity and the value of friendship.",1138838400,8,6601,4.862099644128114
2463198,4,B000CEXFZG,"Soooo...

The complete first season of the Teen Titans series is in a nice 2-disc box set.  Now there's something they should have thought of in the first place.  Either way, this set has the first thirteen action-packed, fun-filled episodes of this ""anime facsimile"".

Also included are the same bonus features just like I mentioned in the other reviews for the first two DVD singles such as the ""From Comic to Cartoon"" feature and the Puffy Ami Yumi interview and music video.  Another neat bonus is the ""Finding Their Voices"" featurette where they show some very special inside info.  Judging by the title of that featurette, I think it might show auditions for the voices of the characters in the series.  And keep your eyes peeled for other neat stuff on the DVDs.

So besides the fact that this series is fascinating, albeit somewhat extreme in more than one way possible, this 2-disc set is definitely something they should have done in the first place.",1138579200,,960,4.775757575757575

2463200,5,B000CEXFZG,"&hearts; I LOVE this show! I'm SO sad that the show is canceled but thankfully we get to buy the season DVDs. It's truly one of the best superhero shows out there. The characters, animation, storyline, everything are truly intriguing.

  The show revolves around five Teen Superheroes battling against crime and evil. Our 5 teen wonders include Robin (leader of the pack), Starfire (tough alien chick), Beast Boy (animal changling), Cyborg (techno man), and Raven (sarcastic dark magic powerhouse). All have amazing powers and intriguing storylines behind them. They all reside in  Jump City, based on San Francisco Calif., in a big tower known as the ""T Tower"". This show if full of action and never gets dull. This isn't your basic cartoon where characters have a 2-dimensional personality. All characters, good and evil, have a bigger than life story behind them. As each season goes by, we learn more and more about the superheroes and villains of Jump City.

  This show is quite the package. Ranging from a comical action cartoon all the way to a dark and mysterious show.

  Though I must say the way the DVDs are being released is pretty stupid. They should just wait to put the entire season on one DVD rather than releasing halfs of each season. Aside from that fact, this cartoon is one of my favorites. Never gets dull and annoying.",1137801600,5,1344,4.804347826086956
