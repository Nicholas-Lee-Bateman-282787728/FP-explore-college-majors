But I've grown accustomed to the digital 3D modeling animation style and have come to believe that the modern style and the vibrant colors suit the adventurous storylines.

Set long before Peter Pan's arrival in Neverland, the Tinker Bell films are a genuine delight. While their target audience is probably 3-7 year old girls, brothers as well as parents and grandparents will also be entertained. The stories - of understanding that everyone is special, of taking responsibility for your actions, of finding the meaning of friendship - hold meaning for all of us. What really stands out for me in these films is the incredible amount of creativity that lies behind them. The Disney Imagineers have done a wonderful job ""tinkering"" with the natural elements of Pixie Hollow to make everyday items such as clothing, tools and homes, as well as the special items used by the fairies to complete their special fairy duties. It's a lot of fun to see what the Imagineers come up with.

Tink herself is far from perfect; she makes many mistakes and has to deal with the fallout of both her hot temper and her penchant for charging ahead without considering the consequences of her actions - which are often disastrous. To me, these imperfections provide great opportunities for discussion. ""Do you think it would have been better if Tink had talked with Fairy Mary first?"" or ""If Tink hadn't had a temper tantrum and kicked the watch Terrance got her, she wouldn't be in so much trouble right now, would she?""

The Three pack includes the first three films in the series:

Created by a baby's first laughter, Tinker Bell travels on the wind to Neverland, where she comes into being in Pixie Hollow. There, she learns about the different talents fairies possess and comes to understand that her own talent is important, even if it might, at first glance, seem less glamorous than talents practiced by some of the other fairies.

When Tinker Bell accidentally breaks a rare moonstone used to renew the supply of fairy dust fairies need in order to fly and to carry out many of their magical duties, she sets off on a secret journey to find a legendary mirror that can grant her wish to have the moonstone repaired.

During a summer visit to England, Tinker Bell is captured by Lizzy, a little girl who believes deeply in fairies and just wants to be Tink's friend. But when fairykind is endangered by the human knowledge of their existence, all the fairies (even Vidia!) must work together, combining their talents to rescue Tink. Faith, Trust and Pixie Dust!

At this time, two additional Tinker Bell films are planned: Tinker Bell: A Winter Story (2011) and Tinker Bell: Race Through the Seasons (2012). There is also talk of a live action film.

Though my enjoyment of the films could not possibly match the pleasure I've taken in watching my grandchildrens' faces glow with joy, gasp with dismay and dissolve into laughter as THEY watch them, I'm happy to admit that I darned well like them, too.

Happily recommended.

Note (updated 5/20/2011): Prices will fluctuate, of course, but at this time, you can save about $16 by buying these films separately.",1284422400,12,4427,5.734756097560975
