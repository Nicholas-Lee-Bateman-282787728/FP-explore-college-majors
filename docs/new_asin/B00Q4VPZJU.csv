6854115,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"From the low angle motorcycle shot to the final,apocalyptic shot of the inevitable,RABID draws you into its cold chilling world of vicious horror completely. Some of the acting is a bit shaky and some of the characterization a bit one-dimensional but the direction is never less than masterful. The two combined,make the film realistically unnerving. The film's basic premise is that a virus transmitted by humans,once virulent,is incapable of being contained. Unchecked it results in primal,brutal and wanton behaviour,a theme prevalent in many Cronenberg films. The film even succeeds in gaining sympathy for the main victim and cause of the disease,via of her disposal of several unlikeable characters and an appealing performance by Marilyn Chambers. RABID is almost totally bleak,totally downbeat in portraying a city out of control......Totally classic.",988675200,19,859,5.666666666666667
6854116,3,B00Q4VPZJU,"Rabid was Cronenberg's second feature film and a more conventional ""horror movie"" than his first feature Shivers (aka They Came from Within). Despite Rabid's weak script and low budget restrictions it clearly showed that Cronenberg was a writer/director with a strong vision and someone to watch for.
Rose (played unevenly by Marilyn Chambers) suffers severe wounds in a motorcycle accident. Experimental surgery turns her into a vampire of sorts that infects her victims with a incurable and fatal case of mania that resembles rabies. Rose, either fearing for her own safety or forced by a new and barely understood predatory nature (Cronenberg never explores this in any real depth), escapes from the clinic where she has been recovering from her surgery and unleashes a terrifying plague. Although it may sound silly Cronenberg treats the subject with such an icy documentary like detachment that the results are quite chilling.
Sadly the part of Rose (originally intended for Sissy Spacek) is underwritten, she has almost no dialogue and Chambers could not communicate any real emotional conflict in her performance. She becomes simply an object to move the plot forward, the secondary characters getting more development. This was a serious flaw in the movie and the primary reasons I gave it three stars and not four.
The DVD itself is pretty sad. The movie is not letterboxed, but the image is not injured too badly by this. There is a trailer that produces a chuckle when, after an impressive car wreck, the camera zooms into Rose's first victim and the narrator solemnly says ""Don't worry about him he's DEAD."" There is no commentary, and the biographies are pretty so so, with Corman (founder and CEO of the companies that both released Rabid back in 1976 and this re-issue) getting the most lauditory and in depth biography, despite having really nothing to do with making this movie at all.
Cronenberg fans will want this movie in their collections regardless of the movie and DVDs flaws. Fans of the genre might want to check this out to see the boundless possibilites the vampire tale does have to offer.",981676800,34,2118,5.002832861189802
6854117,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"I first saw this film in the late 1980s on tv, and loved it. I was really excited when it came back in print and I purchased the VHS edition. The movie was even better than I had remembered! And of course unedited for tv.  Marilyn Chambers gives a great performance as a woman who is subjected to experimental surgical procedures by an unethical doctor after being in a bad motorcycle accident.  The result is that she develops a strange...apparatus and becomes a bit vampiric and murderous. The scenes of panic in Downtown Montreal are really priceless.  I also like the performance of the actor who plays Marilyn's boyfriend.  I don't know who designed the new cover to this film but it is really a travesty, the old cover was really cool. Don't let the cheesy cover scare you away from this real treat. The downbeat ending is really satisfying also. Don't miss ""Rabid"".",979171200,4,872,4.642857142857143

6854124,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"An early David Cronenberg film, ""Rabid"" showcases the director's skill at unsettling his audience with themes of disease transmission and infection. The plot sees the heroine Rose (Marilyn Chambers) suffering a road accident and receiving emergency treatment at a plastic surgery clinic (due to it being the closest place to the accident site). The treatment she receives is experimental, and the results are unexpected to say the least because Rose develops some very unnatural eating habits, leaving a string of victims behind her, who go on to spread a fatal infection to other people.

The character development is better than it might have been. Rose is oblivious to the chaos she is causing. She is scared and confused by her own physical condition, but unaware that her victims are becoming something far worse than she is. Marilyn Chambers does a good job in the role. Wavering between frightened, nauseous, sexually alluring and bewildered, she successfully carries the movie. Some of her ambiguous expressions may be a result of the actress's inexperience but I think this makes Rose a complex character. In some of her scenes she has an impassive, almost sleepwalking demeanour but for me this works too, and I was able to imagine the many layers of inner dialogue going on inside her mind.

Chambers is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast. All the acting is all very natural, and the people who get ill really do look horrible. The film goes a lot further with it's spread of the rabies-like disease than I expected, skilfully hiding it's low budget. Scenes of attacks on subway trains and in shopping malls are chilling and realistic. The special effects are very good. My only niggle is the amount of time Rose spends naked in the film, in many scenes where it is simply not relevant, and it seems like Cronenberg exploited Chamber's past movie career by asking her to do this and boost box office takings. The role would have worked very well without it. One other issue is that all of the men Rose meets after she leaves the hospital seem to be slimeballs who only want one thing. Like his previous film ""Shivers"", the movie seems to warn of the perils of sexual contact. It does it well, and the result is effective and memorable.",1486339200,,2254,4.83678756476684

6854158,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"Introductory note: I'm pretty sure there's a legal requirement to refer to the star of this film as ""porn star Marilyn Chambers""; there may have been a statute of limitations on mentioning ""star of Behind the Green Door and Insatiable"", some time after the last VHS copies disappeared from circulation. Ms Chambers acts as well as anyone in this low budget contagion-horror, and has at least three topless scenes. So that's that out of the way.

Rose (Chambers) suffers burns in a motorcycle accident. She is rushed to the handily nearby private plastic surgery hospital, the Keloid Clinic (named after lead surgeon Dr Keloid, not because they specialise in reducing unsightly scars). She has skin grafts which are subject to some kind of irradiation, which gives the grafts a stem cell-like ability to adapt to the location to which they're grafted (or something), the key facts being that this is an experimental procedure which carries a risk of ""tumours"". The unexpected side effect Rose suffers is to grow a little vagina under her left armpit, from which a little penis with a spike emerges, with which she is compelled to drain human blood for nutrition; ordinary food causes her to vomit. The victims suffer amnesia, and within a few hours start to bleed and froth at the mouth and start biting the nearest person, i.e. they become zombies, until they expire altogether a few hours later again. Those who are bitten carry the contagion, and so on.

The DVD had the grainy, washed-out quality of cheap film stock transferred onto VHS and then digitised, which adds its own kind of atmosphere. Performances were generally wooden, with Ms Chambers, her boyfriend and her best friend slightly better than the others. Despite the rockingly trashy premise, the film was slow to get going, and until about the half way mark, I wondered if an exploitation film starring a porn actress who attacked her victims with a little spiky penis was somehow only going to offer conceptual pleasures. Escape velocity was eventually achieved, and the latter half of Rabid had both some genuinely creepy and suspenseful scenes, as when one of the hospital employees returns home to find his infant missing and bloodstains in the nursery, and crowd-pleasing set pieces, including a zombie attack on a subway train, and another at a shopping mall after the imposition of martial law, where a Santa gets caught in the crossfire. Also, there's a mild rape-revenge theme (it's an exploitation film thematic bonanza), where one actual attempted rapist in a cow shed (just after Rose discovers that the blood of non-human mammals just won't do) and two creeps in a (porno) cinema and a mall get what's coming to them.

Rose's boyfriend drives through Montreal trying to find her, and his car is attacked by a zombie. An army sniper stationed on a garbage truck shoots the frothing assailant off the front of the car, and two men in Hazmat suits remove the body and spray the car windscreen with some sterilising fluid, in what my wife identified as a tribute to Canada's universal health care system.

Come for the trash, stay for the technical accomplishment and the lesson in film history.",1399075200,8,3171,4.91044776119403
6854159,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"This is what I suspect is a Canadian publicity poster. I say so because its rating in the U.S. is R, but I'm betting you money Canada stamped it with an X. Cronenberg knew something about art-vs.-authorities; I learned a thing or two from him about Canadian film censorship in an interview I watched several years ago. But this isn't about Canada, or film censorhip. It's about RABIES, and not the disease but, rather, as I""m sure you've guessed, the film by Canada's Cronenberg, once an auteur of cerebral horror, now auteuring about in other genres, rooting around for dark subtext, as is his wont. In his horror  heyday, he delivered stark fright films armed with katana-sharp satire and loaded with body horror images and ideas that managed to be both brainiac and visceral. His horror films (not disregarding his non-horror with fanboyish elitism but simply focusing on his heritage as a horror maestro) left indelible marks seared into the skull candy of every daring viewer that stayed with it til the end and tried to make sense of it. With Cronenberg there's always way more to the story than just the story, and sometimes the story climaxes in a way that is only decipherable through abstract cognition (Videodrome) - the very tool that allows you to ferret out the subtext in even his concrete stories. Cronenberg, in all fairness, is much more apt to proffer a decipherable and generally linear story than David Lynch. Both are capable of streetwise storytelling but also transcendent detours up-kilter into arthouse aesthetics. I'm not suggesting ""art"" movies are better than popular movies, or the other way around; I'm just having fun. For that matter, most movies are art, arthouse or otherwise. And both Lynch and Cronenberg have in their careers crafted cinema that qualifies as arthouse by cinematic critical standards (the value of which is probably more than mundane viewers think but probably not as lofty as film elitists would believe). But while both are apt to veer left field, with Cronenberg it's an occasional thing since he's usually happy to attach his most sublime ideas as subtext to a cohesive narrative, but Mr. Lynch has more sinister intentions and takes the left hand path frequently - and he doesn't use turn signals when he makes his left turns, either. (By the way, I hope you realize my reference to ""left hand path"" is merely a semantic allegory, if you will. God, you people take things too literally ....) Neither Lynch's nor Cronenberg's approach is ""right"" - and both are. But I find myself digressing. Blame Cronenberg (yes, yes, and Lynch, too) for making such damned interesting movies. Take RABID, for instance. Right out of the gate he's messing with you. It's a movie whose body horror has practically pendulous subtext of sexuality swaying beneath the body of the story's forward movement. Yep. The freakish body mutation in this film (I love that there is a director about whom you can say, ""The weird body screw-up in THIS film of So-and-so's is ..."") is one that manages to be both yonic and phallic and also confronts the viewer with an image mixing the ultimate erogenous zone with a traditionally unsexy region of physical geography. The absurd but deadly serious horror drips down from surface layers of physical disgust (and sexual arousal in an unpleasant context) to deeper layers of psychological shock. This is both highly cerebral and viscerally primal. And yet all this headtrip freakshow psychosexual-horror cinematic cranial experimentation upon the audience is handled with a peculiar sort of discretion and understatement. In the context of Cronenberg's typical aridity (but compelling all the same and maybe because of), the moments of sheer visual terror, rather than standing out to an over the top degree in the aforementioned arid aura, instead function as graphic images infused with clinical restraint. If these moments had followed the former path, RABID would have risked either achieving elevated ludicrousness and thus loss of credibility or else would have degenerated to ugly excess. As it is we approach with an already signature Cronenberg coldness the disturbing material. This aloofness enables us to draw near and observe with something approaching medical detail the bizarre physical horror before us; nevertheless, the organic horror of it is not stifled or muted for us because of the detached attitude of the film. Marvelously, in all this physical horror there is, part and parcel, a driving psychological horror. The two are one and the same. To watch a Cronenberg film is to enjoy a cerebro-visceral experience. Even further cinematic skull penetration of the hapless viewer comes in the form of Cronenberg's casting of Marilyn Chambers in the central female role, the woman at the epicenter of the spreading epidemic of a sort of super-rabies-like disease whose first-wave infected were made sick by the literally piercing attack of the misplaced yonic cavities with phallic extensions. The irony of this sexually charged horror film's casting of Chambers, for those who don't know, is that the rest of her cinematic resume is filled with titles of porn movies.

I don't want to say any more for fear of saying too much, though this is an old picture. It's a lean but FX sprinkled dose of chilling mind-body horror that's every bit as gripping as his later similarly themed scary movies. His scary movies, by the way, are more than mere scary movies.

6854160,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"Rabid (David Cronenberg, 1977)
[originally posted 23Jul2001]

Marilyn Chambers was Cronenberg's second choice to play Rose in this film. Sissy Spacek was his first. I've no idea how he got from point A to point B, but I've always found that thoroughly amusing.

The film itself is anything but. If you're looking for the raw and bleeding edge of psychosexual terror, no one's better at it than Cronenberg, and no one's been better at it for the last quarter century, starting with the brilliant Shivers in 1975. Cronenberg's early films are far more unrefined than his recent output, and the string that began with Shivers and ended with 1980's Scanners (with Rabid solidly in the middle) may, arguably, be the best work he's ever done.

Rose (Marilyn Chambers) is involved in a motorcycle accident that leaves her horribly mutilated. By coincidence, the accident happens three hours from the nearest major medical center, but just down the road from a rural plastic surgery center, the Keloid Clinic, which is experiemnting with some radical new techniques in skin grafting technology. Needless to say, as in all Cronenberg flicks, you can expect said technology to go wrong in the most disturbing of ways.

Cronenberg's confrontational way of dealing with his subject matter makes his films, for the most part, very uncomfortable affairs, and there are a good number of people who just can't watch them at all. They're missing out on some great filmmaking. Cronenberg uses horror for the same savagely satirical attacks on modern society as does George Romero and (in his later movies) John Carpenter. For those with the stomach for it, this is one of Cronenberg's less subtle jaunts. While it's not as uniformly excellent as Scanners or The Brood, with Cronenberg, less subtle usually equates to more fun. ****",1393891200,,1813,5.033333333333333

6854164,4,B00Q4VPZJU,Rabid is terrific early Cronenberg that on the whole over comes it's budgetary constraints. It's full of all the themes that flavour the director's best works and gives and indication that Marilyn Chambers might have had a career away from porn is she had been able to over come mainstream industry prejudice,1376092800,,308,4.9423076923076925
6854165,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"Though David Cronenberg already had a minor hit horror feature under his belt with SHIVERS (aka THEY CAME FROM WITHIN), RABID is the first ""true Cronenberg movie"" for me (i.e., the first that didn't look like a student film). The story of beautiful young Rose (Seventies porn icon Marilyn Chambers), having gotten disfigured in a motorcycle accident and used as a guinea pig in an experimental form of reconstructive surgery which leaves her with a penile ""stinger"" under her armpit which drains blood from another's body, and unbeknownst to her the stinger also injects her victims with a fast-acting, virulent strain of rabies. She escapes from the clinic that operated on her (leaving a trail of infected or dead people in her wake - the powerful cover image is of the woman she assaulted in the clinic's jacuzzi, who she stuck in a walk-in freezer after drowning) and makes it to her home town of Montreal, as the authorities attempt to track down the source of the ""super-rabies"" so they can contain the plague Rose is unwittingly causing....

Despite a tight budget (a half-million dollars Canadian, or about double what your average Roger Corman cheapie cost back then), Cronenberg succeeds in adroitly staging an apocalyptic epidemic in Quebec province. He's aided immensely by Chambers, who turns in a much stronger performance than you might expect as a Nice Pretty Girl (the kind you want to ask out, or take care of if she's in trouble) turned reluctant predator - while she's not in the league of Sissy Spacek (the director's first choice for the role, turned down by the producers because Chambers was better-known at the time!), she still does a good job with the part.

This DVD, digitally remastered and released by Canadian distributor Somerville House, comes with a Commentary track by Cronenberg, as well as a half-hour interview (clearly part of a larger career retrospective, but still worth watching). Would that Cronenberg's other, better known horror movies THE BROOD and SCANNERS had this much attention paid to them!",1374624000,,2043,5.0058823529411764

Rabid has a vampire like theme of lust for blood, though most of the victims lose their sense of self much as zombies do as a parasite of some kind controls their mind and actions.

This dvd is a bit raw but watchable, though at times the image presented gives one the impression that one is viewing the movie through a dirty window, which actually seems to enhance the vile nature of the film. One of the bonuses is a relatively recent 20 minute interview with Cronenberg as he discusses his early films. Also included is the director's film commentary, production stills, biographies, and production notes.",1369699200,,717,4.829268292682927
6854167,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"A motorcycle accident leaves Rose terribly disfigured, so she is given an experimental skin graft that restores her to her former beauty. The procedure has an unexpected side effect, however, as she is overcome with an insatiable need to feed on the blood of others through a strange new appendage that has grown out of her arm pit. Soon, all of Montreal becomes infected by the disease Rose leaves behind in her victims. David Cronenberg's sophomore Horror outing falls closely in line with his first feature, SHIVERS, both in theme and in structure, although the claustrophobic confines of the small apartment building have opened up to the whole of Montreal. Man's attempt to control nature through medical advancement unleashes unspeakable horrors once again, twisting the body into the weapon of our own destruction. The larger scale allows Cronenberg to touch on the same concerns of governmental inadequacy in times of crises that we have seen before in George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE CRAZIES. Here, vampirism is linked to venereal disease, as well, another growing concern that would dominate public interest in the early 80's with the AIDS epidemic. Former Playmate Marilyn Chambers is surprisingly good as Rose, a sexy seductress who easily lures countless victims into her web. While it may not be a work for which he is most recognized, RABID shows a continued development in David Cronenberg's particular style that would later recur in works like THE BROOD, SCANNERS, and VIDEODROME.

6854169,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"""Rabid"" is an above average horror film by David Cronenberg. Yes, the same director who brings his horror affinity to mainstream titles like ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises."" Cronenberg is a master of horror, and it surprises me that Hollywood plagiarists (er, re-envisionists) haven't remade any of his films yet (if they remake ""Scanners"" I hope their heads explode). Cronenberg's 70's films were labeled pornography at the time, as ""Shivers"" brought us a murder-sex plague and ""Rabid"" followed it by casting an adult film actress. ""Rabid"" is more of a demon possession/rabies hybrid, surely influencing more recent films like ""28 Days Later"" and ""Quarantine."" His 70's style was more horror-oriented, while his 80's style incorporated science-fiction - but always disgusting and dehumanizing. ""Rabid"" is nowhere near the director's best but definitely a fine prelude to future mastery.",1281916800,,902,5.496402877697841
6854170,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"Rose (Marylin Chambers) with boyfriend Hart (Frank Moore) get in a bike accident, a local hospital uses her body for biological experiments. However this does make her well and gives her a new sex organ under her pits which erects when it comes out during hormone-driven urges as it's an organ with a needle at the tip that drains victims of blood as she has became a biological vampire. Doctors Dan and Roxanne Keloid (Howard Ryshpan and Patrica Gage) were the ones who were responsible for the experiment, Rose is on the loose as she hungers for the blood of men and women turning them into vampire-zombie hybrids that would do the same thing causing a plague.

Excellent underrated Science Fiction horror thriller from writer-director film auteur David Cronenberg. Here's a movie that breaks both vampire and zombie molds for the vampire here is not your typical stereotype for she has no fangs and doesn't fear crosses as she is biological made through science after being brought back from near-death. Co-starring Susan Roman (Sailor Jupiter on Sailor Moon, Rock and Rule and The Raccoon) and Joe Silver (Raggedy Ann and Andy a Musical Adventure and Creepshow 2) This is a smart, gory and well made ride from Cronenberg who would give us ""The Brood"", ""Scanners"", ""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"" and many more cult faves of his and this one is a must see for fans of Sci-fi, horror, vampires and zombies.

This DVD contains both the English and French-Canadian language ""Rage"" versions with extras like trailers, interviews, commentary from Cronenberg, and photo galleries.

Police and authorities try to contain the plague by killing the carriers of the virus.

With a bigger budget, the movie could have had a broader scope in the script, but (given the small budget), it is an effective thriller.

The movie pre-dates the AIDS crisis by some 15 years, but it is almost prophetic in showing how a virus can spread and infect others on a mass scale.

The film hi-lights Cronenberg's attraction to medicine and disease, which you'll find as a theme in a lot of his films.

6854173,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Marilyn Chambers.  I will always remember her excellent performance in David Cronenberg's science fiction horror classic ""Rabid.""  If only she had starred in more horror films of the same caliber.  Marilyn would've made an excellent scream queen.  She reminds me of Jamie Lee Curtis.  Both young women had that wholesome, pure girl-next-door look.  The type of girl you'd love to ask to your senior prom or take on a motorcycle ride through the countryside.

  Rose (Marilyn Chambers) is badly burned in a motorcycle accident.  She is rushed to the nearby Keloid Institute where she undergoes experimental skin grafts.  Unfortunately, as in many of Cronenberg's films (""Shivers,"" ""The Brood,"" ""Scanners,"" and ""The Fly""), the treatment has dangerous side effects; Rose experiences a mutation.  In her armpit, she develops a needle-like protuberance.  She awakens from a coma with an insatiable thirst for blood and commences seducing and attacking men around her, inflicting them with a Rabies-like virus.  The incubation period is short and soon these men become crazed lunatics, foaming at the mouth and biting anyone near them.  The virus spreads like wild fire and all of Montreal is in danger of becoming rabid.

  ""Rabid"" has a very suspenseful, terrifying plot.  It belongs in the same genre as the end-of-the-world films where a mutating virus threatens to destroy all of mankind as in the classic ""Omega Man"" and the modern ""27 Days Later.""  It does not have the look and feel of a low budget film.  There is a lot of violence, the type you would find in a zombie film such as ""Dawn of the Dead.""  There is mass hysteria on the subways and at the malls as people are attacked and bitten.  Soldiers shoot those who have been infected.  At the end, soldiers in white decontamination suits are seen gathering up the dead.  Like many of the horror films in the seventies, ""Rabid"" does not have a happy, cheerful ending.  It is rather bleak and disturbing.

  I must praise Somerville House for releasing an excellent DVD package of ""Rabid.""  It is presented in a crisp, clear widescreen format with excellent audio.  There is an interesting, informative interview with Cronenberg who explains how he came to cast Marilyn Chambers despite critics complaining that his first film, ""Shivers,"" was pornographic.  Her filmography is also provided on the DVD.  Despite all of her other films, I will always remember Marilyn as the star of ""Rabid.""",1240185600,16,2496,4.980582524271845

6854184,3,B00Q4VPZJU,"Movie: medium
Of all of Cronenberg's movies, this is one of my least favourite. It is like Shivers, but on a grander scale, though I actually prefer Shivers to this. Maybe I liked the phallic/crap-like parasites of Shivers over the phallic ""fang"" housed in Rose's armpit.
There is some good gore and action, and perhaps most interesting (as Cronenberg likes to point out on the commentary) are his ""prophecies:"" an epidemic (like AIDS or SARS), stem-cell research, our increasing dependence on telephones, plastic surgery ""resorts,"" etc.
DVD: medium
Picture looks good, though I'm no expert on the technical side of things. The twenty-minute interview with Cronenberg is interesting, but it was part of the VHS release of the film. His commentary is (as usual) well done. Plus there are some stills and the trailer. Certainly not bare bones, but I was hoping for more from this DVD.
So overall, I would give this a MEDIUM. A must for Cronendrones like myself, but for others I would recommend the wonderful Criterion editions of Naked Lunch and Videodrome (and Dead Ringers if you can get your hands on one), along with Spider and eXistenZ.",1092614400,,1140,4.942708333333333
6854185,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"Director David Cronenberg does creepy well. This may be because he seems a little creepy himself -- like a stodgy, corduroy-wearing history professor who appears totally harmless but secretly likes to handcuff women to bedposts then place live tarantulas on their naked torsos. I doubt the director is quite that extreme, but it's that kind of perversity that colors most of his movies, especially those made in the late '70s through the 1980s. Cronenberg's second feature film, ""Rabid,"" straddles horror and sci-fi (as do many of his movies) with its story about a young woman, Rose, who, after receiving some experimental skin grafts following a horrific motorcycle accident, develops a need for human blood (given that Rose is played by Marilyn Chambers, one might even say an ""Insatiable"" need for blood). But it's not your usual modern day vampire tale. For starters, Rose doesn't sprout fangs but rather an orifice in her armpit that resembles an inflamed sphincter, through which a phallic looking proboscis emerges and punctures the victim. After which the victim generally starts foaming at the mouth and attacking whoever's handy. Before long, Montreal is under martial law as its citizens become, well, you know...

 Though not Cronenberg's best movie, ""Rabid"" holds up to his later works like ""Scanners"" and ""Videodrome."" Despite a low budget, ""Rabid"" has some relatively convincing special effects, and the dreary location shots (made drearier by the dank weather) help establish an overall feeling of desolation. The epidemic and martial law aspects to his story are quite relevant today, and if he'd played up the plastic surgery angle a bit more the movie would be triply prescient. (Imagine if ""Rabid"" were made today, then he could get cameos from such surgically reconstructed celebs as Joan Rivers, Bruce Jenner and Michael and LaToya Jackson.) Cronenberg's script is lightly peppered with his silly sense of humor (a plastic surgeon named Dr. Keloid; a health minister's advice for avoiding rabies: ""Don't get bit""), but the material is played so seriously that the jokes have a dry irony rather than overt goofiness. Still, for all its merits, ""Rabid"" probably wouldn't have received nearly as much attention had it not been for the stunt casting of porn star Chambers (Al Adamson tried a similar ploy when he cast Georgina Spelvin in ""I Spit on Your Corpse""). She's actually pretty good in this movie. On the commentary track Cronenberg wonders why Chambers didn't go on to star in more mainstream movies, but this fact doesn't surprise me. Even today, when the E! Entertainment channel regularly profiles porn stars, adult performers usually are only cast in mainstream movies as a joke or to give low-budget films a publicity boost. Chambers may have proved she could do more on film than just sex acts, but in mainstream Hollywood she'd always be ""just a porn star.""

 The extras on the Ventura Special Edition disc not only include Cronenberg's commentary but a 30-minute interview as well. There's also the theatrical trailer and written bios on Cronenberg and Chambers. Wished Chambers provided commentary as well (was she even asked?), but her absence is hardly detrimental to this DVD package. Definite must for fans of David Cronenberg, Marilyn Chambers and low-budget creepiness.",1090886400,7,3312,5.173507462686567

Marilyn plays Rose, a chick who has a bike accident and is experimented on resulting in a disease on anyone that touches her and turning them flesh eating mad . Nice plot, kinda reminds me of an aids epidemic or something like that. Now that would be scary.
You can catch this film on the Independent Film Channel during their ""Indie Screams"" week. (Check local listings.)
The gory. A nurse getting her finger cut off by a doctor and doctor starts eating the finger!!!
The good. Marilyn in the nude! (I wish there more of these scenes), There is also a great car crash in the movie where a car falls on the highway only to be run over by a truck. (What bad luck for the driver)
The shocking. A dept. store Santa Claus being gunned down (Accidentally).This scene probably is the most scandalous in the film, even I was suprised that something like this was written in the script. Shame on you David. :-)
The saddest. Some of the music is well done,especially the sad melodramatic music. The end is sad too, (Poor Marilyn being thrown in the trash truck after she herself is the victim of the virus she has spread). Her acting in this movie is pretty good, I was suprised.
Great funny lines like "" what the fu*k are we running here a nursery."" ""You carry a plague youve killed hundreds of people!.""

She does kinda have that Cybill Shepherd type that look that just oozes goddessness, so her presence in the film is felt.

6854188,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"Rabid was the second film of David Cronenberg after Shivers.  Both films are very similar in theme and were the excellent start to Cronenberg's great career.  With this new digitally remastered ""Special Edition"" Rabid, for the first time in a region 1 release, can be seen in its original aspect ratio, which is a real treat.
The film concerns a woman named Rose, played by porn star Chambers in a surprisingly great performance, who gets into a serious motorcycle accident and has radical, experimental surgery in order to save her life.  She survives the accident only to find that the surgery has given her a growth.  This growth also has a taste for human blood.  Before too long Rose is on the prowl looking for anyone to ease her hunger.  However, when she attacks her victims do not die.  Instead they turn, rather quickly, into flesh craving zombies.  Soon the whole city of Montreal is taken over.
The film holds up well over the years.  The extreme low budget doesn't take away from the intensity of the plot.  This was a film made by a director still learning the craft.  Therefore, it isn't a perfect film, but the themes it deals with are pulled off well.  Rabid is much more than just a horror film.  It's a film about relationships and characters that don't fully have control over their actions.  The viewer really feels for Rose at the end of film.  Although she was responsible for the outbreak, it really wasn't her fault.  She was being moved by forces from within her body that were more powerful than her mind.  That is a theme that Cronenberg would return to again and again.
This new release is pretty well done.  The colors aren't as bright as the UK release, but it's a good enough transfer for the price.  There is also a commentary and interview with Cronenberg on the disc which are pretty interesting.  This disc is worth the upgrade from the lower quality, full frame release from a few years ago.  If you're a fan of Cronenberg or of good quality horror films in general, this is a must see.  Even if you aren't into horror films I would recommend it.

6854191,3,B00Q4VPZJU,"Let's not get carried away. This film is not a masterstroke from Cronenberg nor is it entirely terrible. But the film veers from side to side and in effect there are many parts of the film which have moments of genius mixed with moments of terrible scenes.
Cronenberg himself has admitted that he had a moment of crisis while making the movie. He thought the whole film sounded ridiculous and maybe it wasn't worth it. He's got a point no matter what way your take on this film. It does border on the patently ridiculous but remember we're talking about a standard horror movie here. It's a cheap thrill'n'scare movie that most people would watch at a drive by cinema. We know there's going to be some cagey b-movie standard acting so we're not exactly taxing ourselves are we?
Ah yes which reminds me, Marilyn Chambers actually doesn't do a bad job at giving "" serious acting "" a go. Cronenberg jokes that he doesn't know whose idea it was to tell her that his movies were "" serious "" but she acts well. I've never seen any of her porn material ( and I don't really want to either ) but there are times here when her history in porn might have helped her in his role. Actually give Ivan Reitman credit here - it was a brilliant idea to get Chambers in for this film - people are definitely going to take an interest if a porno star wants to make a go at serious acting ( especially men )
There are some brilliantly shot scenes like when somebody takes a drill to a car with people in it ( that WOULD frighten people ) and the ending too which is rather chilling and is an effective ending for the film.
So all in all it's not as good as later films such as Scanners, Videodrome, Dead Ringers or even Crash ( even though I have a love hate relationship with that movie ) in it's affecting creepiness. It's best looked at as a sophomore effort from Cronenberg and while it has serious flaws in the film, it has moments of demented magic too given it's nature.

This film, Rabid, just screams 1970's and does not stand the test of time. The music, clothes, hair, even the film used just does not date well...therefore making it a cringe worthy viewing today.
The movie is more gross than scary. Marilyn Chambers develops some kind of drill in her armpit that sucks people's blood...the victims then exhibit rabie like symptoms..it isn't really explained what is going on, or why she gets this mutant thing under her arm...I'm not going to destroy this film in my review, I am just saying it doesn't date well..",1070496000,3,804,4.629370629370629
6854193,3,B00Q4VPZJU,"Every once in awhile when I am feeling reflective I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. I have seen quite a few of them at this point, from some of his earliest stuff like ""Shivers"" to his seminal reworking of ""The Fly"" starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get out of a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, not to mention gory as all get out. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs, messing around with human genetics, or exploring future psychopathologies about car accidents may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. ""Rabid"" constitutes Cronenberg's cosmology in embryonic form. Released in the late 1970s, this film is classic Cronenberg made with a low budget and the inclusion of adult film star Marilyn Chambers in the lead role. While ""Rabid"" suffers from its miniscule budget and slightly uneven pacing, even the most jaded of horror film fans will find plenty to like in this picture.
""Rabid"" opens with an unfortunate motorcycle accident that injures Hart Read and his girlfriend Rose. Fortunately for the two cyclists, the incident occurs within shouting distance of a medical clinic run by Doctor Daniel Keloid, a surgeon specializing in a radical new reconstructive surgery. Keloid wants to mass market a type of skin that will grow on its own once grafted to the human body. He sees the arrival of Rose as a perfect opportunity to test out his new invention, and he promptly does so without obtaining the permission of Rose or her injured boyfriend. Messing around with Mother Nature is always a big no-no in a Cronenberg film, and ""Rabid"" is no different. Rose slowly recovers from her injuries but soon realizes that the operation changed her in fundamental ways. For one thing, she has a strange wound under her armpit and a ravenous urge to feed upon the blood of other people. This blood hunger soon inspires Rose to flee from the clinic, and it isn't long before she wreaks havoc on any members of the local population who fall into her orbit. Worse, her ""wound"" turns out to harbor a particularly vicious little tooth used to siphon off the red stuff from her victims. In the process of feeding, the tooth spreads a sort of super rabies that turns people into drooling, mindless zombies. It isn't long before the rabies spreads like a wildfire through Montreal as both Rose and the victims of her attacks infect other people. The only hope for civilization is to find a way to discover who is the carrier of the disease (the person who has it but is immune to its effects) in order to fashion a vaccine.
I cannot count the times I said to myself as I watched Rabid that this movie would have been much better with a big budget. Cronenberg is constructing an apocalyptic film, but is constantly undermined by his inability to create a sense of impending doom. At one point in the movie, Rose wanders through a shopping mall after the public is fully aware that a killer plague is on the loose. Not only are people wandering through the mall as though nothing is happening, but the soldiers guarding the place don't seem in the least bit concerned that customers are roaming around. They actually gun someone down in the mall, apparently never realizing none of this would be necessary if the government ordered everyone to stay home until the crisis blows over. Moreover, people still drive through the streets in cars despite the intermittent attacks of zombies who throw themselves on the windshields of the vehicles. The government does take some action: sharpshooters on roofs pick off the zombies attacking cars, two or three guys in decontamination suits spray a cleanser on the automobile, and a garbage truck pulls up to dispose of the body. Still, what are you doing on the streets if you are not sick? GO HOME AND LIVE!
I still found much to like about ""Rabid."" Marilyn Chambers does an adequate job of portraying the increasingly panicked Rose, and even does a few nude scenes just in case you forgot about her background. The slobbering zombies occasionally provoke interest, although the makeup is strictly no budget stuff. There's a nice car crash, decent shootings, and the tooth in the armpit thing is somewhat disturbing. I did chuckle over naming a plastic surgeon who is developing a new type of skin ""Keloid,"" since the dictionary defines that term as ""a thick scar resulting from excessive growth of fibrous tissue."" I even liked the tragic ending that leaves us guessing about the fate of the human race. Overall, though, ""Rabid"" is arguably a minor entry in David Cronenberg's filmography. I am not saying this movie is bad, but watch ""Dead Ringers,"" ""Scanners,"" or ""The Fly"" before viewing this effort.
The DVD offers only a trailer and a few bios. The transfer of the film is not the best I have seen, but is watchable. I don't understand why Cronenberg does not record commentaries for his films (at least he hasn't on the few I have watched on DVD), but he really should do so in the future. Despite its notable flaws, ""Rabid"" does emit a downbeat message, some gore, a few funny scenes, and some nice shots of Canada.",1069545600,3,5587,4.754891864057672
6854194,1,B00Q4VPZJU,"If you are ever in the mood for a movie that will leave you with a most profound sense of ""huh??"" this is it. It's about a woman who, with her boyfriend, falls victim to a motorcycle accident. Afterwards she's in some kind of coma. When she comes out of it, she has, for reasons undetermined, a tooth growing out of her armpit. (If you're waiting for the punchline, unfortunately, there is none.) Anyway, she then begins to seduce men, first from among the hospital staff. She gets them in the sack, they start rolling around, and then WHAM, out comes the armpit tooth. She bites her victims with the tooth, and they become all rabid. (Pasty white face, dark circles under the eyes, frothing at the mouth---like the victim of a Full Moon marathon.)
Now, the rabid victims go around and start attacking other to spread the disease. But, apparently, if you're the ""carrier"", which is to say the one with the tooth in your armpit, you are seemingly immune to all other symptoms of the disease. By now, the dreaded rabiditis has spread all over the place. The police, and health authorities are called in. The local shopping malls are no longer safe. (When asked to comment, the mayor said, ""huh??) Biohazard guys start going around and shooting the rabid people and throwing them in the back of dumptrucks. Eventually, the ""carrier"" realizes that she's causing all the trouble and decides to lock herself in a room with one of her victims before he goes rabid. What's the ultimate moral to this story? Try not to grow teeth in your armpit? Or maybe, avoid women with teeth in their armpits. I don't know, you decide.",1054252800,7,1613,4.623693379790941
6854195,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"Consecutive cinematic representation of Canada's urban/rural phenomenon, Rabid transcends language barriers with macabre notions that encompass the young French Canadian backlash to the banality of life in towns with long French names.  The opening sequence establishes omnipresence of car culture, existing as entities that envelop the frame, the low angle shots depicting the potentiality for exodus as larger than life.  Both vehicles function by causing violent crashes by which the human body is augmented and then reconstructed thanks to the progress of science.  Here the workingman has failed to ""load the Econoline van"", a point hammered home by nagging wife, Francis McDormand's French Canadian twin no doubt.  Highlighting both the freedom and subsequent limitations of the young French Canadian and the problematic family unit, the film's introduction coincides with the climate of stagflation, and the subsequent oil crisis.  Deconstructing car culture ensures that jogging does kill!
Producer Ivan Reitman came up with the idea of casting Marylin Chambers ... as a cost effective way of solidifying box office draw.  Marilyn's previous ""experience"" worked with the Cinepix repor of soft-core sex flicks.  This taboo star-system was a compromise of cumfort zones.  Coinciding with the AIDS outbreak Chambers, walking virus, is an apologetic martyr of ""very experimental surgery"" going wrong, her mutated body protruding a blood-sucking phallus concealed in a vaginal orifice, common to the left armpit.  What warrants explanation here however is if science was able to create a body with a taste for blood, why did mind not develop its rabidity after the barnyard romp with the cow?  Blocking as oversight, her journey from the rural medical clinic to urban Montreal is littered with the usual drunken Indians, horny truck drivers and ""arguably"" the best diner food on the Trans Canada.  And after quarantining all of Montreal, not even Santa Claus can escape paying the ultimate price.
The film grossed seven million, despite production costs of under $700,000 Canadian dollars.  Consecutive financial successes can only intimate that Cronenberg's crew must have received payment in rashers of back bacon.  The financial climate of the late 1970's obviated tax incentives to be administered to cinematic investors.  By putting money into a Canadian project, subsequently boosting the trajectory of Canadian production and content, the investor could write off all investment and even the notion of future contributions for tax purposes, despite obliviation to notions of industry protocol.",1029801600,3,2603,5.573604060913706
6854196,1,B00Q4VPZJU,"I consider myself a big horror fan, what with a video collection of about 110+, but this is a bad egg, of which I regret owning. I hate this film to be perfectly blunt! The only Cronenberg movie thats half decent is THE FLY. I found this film far too slow, and character development was totally scarce. The FX are naff and it all seems like an excuse for ex-porn star Marilyn Chambers to get her kit off every few minutes. Whats with the virus/mutant thing coming from out the armpit, wouldn't it have been more creative to have it coming out of other, more visible parts, like the mouth or something? This could have been a good film, but to me it's one of the... movies ever made. Avoid!!!",996451200,3,691,4.323076923076923
6854197,5,B00Q4VPZJU,"Cronenberg's tale of a viral driven apocalypse pulls the viewer into a world of death and contagion. RABID, along with other early Cronenberg films, deals with the horror from within our own bodies. The story centers on the birth of a disease, which eventually spreads to a large city and causes social breakdown. With its odd storyline, dreary landscapes and creepy music, RABID stands out from other horror films of the 70's in that it has Cronenberg's ""body conscious horror"" philosophy behind it. Originally released on Warner home video in the 80's and on a hard to find import laserdisc from Japan, this DVD of RABID is the best the film has ever looked. The image exhibits little grain, the colors are strong (for early Cronenberg), and the sound is clear. It is presented here in full screen (1:33:1), which is possibly what the film was shot in. Also included on the disc is the full-length theatrical trailer. If you're a fan of 70's horror, Rabid is required viewing.",995500800,15,978,4.792899408284024
8690335,4,B00Q4VPZJU,"Rabid(1977) is an early science fiction-horror film made in Canada and directed by David Cronenberg(Shivers, Scanners, The 1986 Fly remake). It stars the late Marilyn Chambers(Behind the Green Door). This movie is raw and violent. Chambers was cast as Rose, a woman involved in a motorcycle accident. A plastic surgeon patches her together. The surgery goes wrong and she starts attacking people with a ""stinger"" that pops out of her armpit. Rose's victims start to spread a plague; they end up turning into zombie-vampires that drink blood. Lifeforce(1985) borrowed ideas from this film. There's stock music in Rabid. I almost thought someone was going to yell, ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"" when Rose stings a farmer! Rabid is a grindhouse cult classic.",1524960000,,767,5.295081967213115
