1256644,4,B000031VPQ,"First off, I'm going to say that I was there, so if you think this is going to be a biased review... think again.  After attending and later watching the awful Capital Carnage on video, I asn't expecting much from this, the WWF's fourth UK-Only Pay-Per-View.  However, I have to say that I  was very pleasantly surprised.
D'Lo Brown v. Jeff Jarrett, was an  excellent opener, but the next few matches should be watched on  fast-forward.  Believe me, the likes of Mark Henry, Godfather, Gangrel, Val  Venis and the ladies are not worth watching, from an artistic standpoint.  If T&A is what you're looking for, wait until Armageddon comes  out.
Kane and Big Show did fine, considering that one half of the  equation was a chunky, 500 pound lummox.  Chris Jericho and Road Dogg  almost steal match of the night with their high-octane outing, surpassed  only by the main event.
Ah, yes, The Rock and Triple H in a cage.  This  was a great outing for both guys, and looks really good on TV.  I won't  spoil it, but if you'rre any kind of a fan, you probably already know the  result.
Overall, this video is a decent buy.  If you're one of that got  to miss out on seeing this live, then get a copy, if only  for Jericho, Rock and HHH.",946857600,12,1230,4.426008968609866
1256645,5,B000031VPQ,"1. Edge vs Christian for the IC title- a great match to open the show with innovative ways to use the steel cage, the ending is much like the Bret/Owen match at SS 94. winner=Edge 7.5/10

2. Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Hurricane- a filler match, but a good one at that. two of WWFs and Alliances best light-heavyweights have a good match that is worth watching. winner=Sotty 6/10

3. Big Show vs DDP- a squash match that is is pretty preditable, the match was alright for its 3 minutes. winner=Big Show 3.5/10

4. Elimination match for WCW tag team titles-APA vs Dudleyz vs Hardy Boys- first thing I don't know why APA was in this match just because it was revolving around the Hardy Boyz and the Dudleyz, but they showed themselves during this one. Hardyz also prevailed a good showing. winners=The Dudleyz 8/10

5. William Regal vs Tajiri-a good showing by both and they actually work great together with Tajiri taking a few bumps. winner=Regal 5.5/10

6. WCW title-Kurt Angle vs Chris Jericho-another good wrestling classic that is really been forgotten by everyone. this was also a great technical battle with both trying to end the match numerous of times. winner=Chris Jericho 9/10

7. Molly/Stacy vs Lita/Torrie w/Trish as ref-I don't know why these women were on the card this match was just a waste of time. winners=Lita/Torrie 2.5/10

8. WWF title-Stone Cold vs The Rock- this was the match of the night no doubt. this was everything you could want plus more. Jericho and Angle make an appearance near the end of the match with Angle helping Austin win. winner=Stone Cold  10/10

If anyone could find this ppv for under $5.00 should really recommend buying this event.",1169337600,,1672,4.7379310344827585
1256646,4,B000031VPQ,"This was actually one of the best PPV's from 2001 during the invasion angle and actually was one of the better PPV's of that year.

Intercontinental Champion Edge vs. Christian (Steel Cage Match) - They brought back the old 1980's steel cage with the bars for this match.  This is similar to the Bret/Owen cage match from SummerSlam years ago where it wasn't a bloody massacre but a great wrestling match inside a cage.

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane - This was actually a great crusierweight matchup for the time they were given.  It's sad you don't see Scotty used like this anymore.

BIg Show vs. DDP- Bottom line was that DDP was poorly (and that's putting it lightly) used in WWE and this match is a prime example as it was nothing more than a comedic squash.

WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. APA - Honestly, this match is just decent at best.  They had alot of these triple threat/elimination matches during this time so this match wasn't as special at the time.  The match wasn't bad but really, it's nothing memorable about it.

William Regal vs. Tajiri - Two underrated wrestlers go in and have a great mat-wrestling match.  One of my favorites of the night.

WCW Champion Chris Jericho vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt just joined the Alliance so you get Angle in full heel mode.  It starts off a little slow but picks up after a while.  These are two of the best wrestlers going at this time so this was a guarenteed great match...not a classic but it was great.

Lita & Torrie Wilson vs. Mighty Molly & Stacy Keibler (Special Referee - Trish Stratus) - At the time, this would be concidered a average match but compare this to the WWE women's matches of today & the past year...this match now is above average.  This was back when Lita was the female daredevil & when Molly was one of the best women wrestlers in the WWE.

WWE Champion Stone Cold vs. The Rock - WrestleMania 15 & 17 & 19, D-Generation X PPV, and Backlash 1999.  This was the ""forgotten"" match between the two in their series of PPV battles.  I only enjoy the WM17 match more than this one These two never had a bad match & are always entertaining.  Great match.

Bottom line is that this PPV had alot of average to great matches but it's definately worth checking out.",1158364800,,2261,4.428571428571429

WWF Intercontinental Title

Jeff Jarrett (c) w/ Miss Kitty vs. D'Lo Brown - A decent opener with both putting on a good show even if the match slows down in the middle, the crowd was really heated for this match but the finish was a bit cheap. 7/10

Godfather vs. Gangrel - BORING why? This match belonged on Heat not on a PPV slow and dragged just fast forward this part. 3/10

Val Venis vs. Mark Henry - Same as before just another typical time filler. No point to match belonged on Raw. 4/10

WWF Womens Title

Ivory (c) vs. Tori vs. Jacqueline vs. Luna - This is a good womens title match with some good action from all involved. Ivory steals the victory when it should have been a clean finish. 6/10

Kane vs. The Big Show - Another match in their feud from 1999 and not one of their best. This is the big man match of the night with some slow decent wrestling.  6.5/10

Impromptu Match

Jeff Jarrett vs. Chyna - Pointless as this match is like 2 minutes long before Bulldog comes in with the screwjob ending check out their other matches which are better. 2/10

Y2J w/ Curtis Hughes vs. Road Dogg - Second best match of the night as Y2J carried Road Dogg to a good match which is really enjoyable, fast action but ending is a little messy. 8.5/10

Tag Team Elimination

Acolytes vs. Crash & Hardcore Holly vs. Edge & Christian - An OK tag match but i think the Hardys would have been better than Hardcore and Crash, some good action and only tag team match of night. 7/10

X-Pac vs. British Bulldog - This was the event where Bulldog was changing into the heel and X-Pac was his person to beat. Short match with to quick of an ending. 5/10

WWF Title Steel Cage Match

Triple H (c) vs. The Rock - Match of the night and another match in the HHH, Rock feud. Not one of their best but is match of the night because of the action and good ending with Bulldog interfering. 9/10

Alot of these matches are really just for Raw but are decent matches compared to other UK PPV's worth buying for the cage match and Y2J & Road Dogg match.",1125273600,,2163,4.198547215496368

Not the best match in their feud but not that bad either. A good cage match with the old style looking cages which I haven't seen for years. I love the ending of this match. 7.5/10

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane

I was a bit reluctant about this match although it turned out to be a very exciting fast paced Crusierweight match with a nice number of moves by both individuals. 9/10

Big Show vs. DDP

Not very good but the shortness and quickness made it better. The diamond cutter was the best part. 6/10

Elimination Match for the WCW Tag Team Titles

Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. APA

Pretty Dull and boring plenty of these in 2001. A funny part was where Farooq said the f word out loud. Dudley Boyz keep the tag titles. 5.5/10

Tajiri vs. William Regal

Another short but very enjoyable match. Tajiri proved that he is tougher than what he looks to Regal. 7/10

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho (c)

A great submission match where both Angle & Jericho were looking to execute their finishing moves on each other. A yet predictable outcome although very enjoyable match up. 8/10

Average women's match wwf win. 4/10

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock

Yes the best match on the card almost as good as their match at WM17 although this time dq is on. The Rock almost won the title except for the damn interference by Kurt Angle & Chris Jericho who tried to help the Rock other than that a very enjoyable wwf title match. 10/10

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane

Big Show vs. DDP

DDP's promo was the best part.  Really just a comedic squash.

Intercontinental Steel Cage Match: Edge Vs Christian A Good
paced match that saw both men execute many diiferent manuevers

Diamond Dallas Page Vs Big Show A Total Squash match and time
killer rolled into one. At least it was kept quick **

effort by all 6 men and very good. ****

Good match, kept the fans going.  Edge and Christian have good ring work and I really enjoy cage matches with the old school type of cage.  The only thing was is that the match was a little bit short, but still a great display.
Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane

Surprisingly this match was pretty good, a lot of high risk tech. wrestling which I haven't seen in a while and I really was feelin' this match.  Impressive
Big Show vs. DDP
Rating:  **
Oh man I don't what Vince was thinkin' trying to put a rematch from WCW/nWo Starrcade '98 on this card.  I mean we all saw DDP beat the Show back in '98 and that was a good match.  But this match was just not as good.  Big show Dominated, we get to see a diamond cutter but the Show kicks out and finishes the Bang Man off with the Showstopper.  It gets two because I like DDP.
WCW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP 3-WAY ELIMINATION MATCH:
APA vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (Champions)
Rating: ****
Too quick for APA but after they were eliminated, the Hardyz and the Dudleyz carried the rest of the match.  If you've seen all the Hardyz, Dudleyz, and E&C matches..this one is no different, just no Tables, Chairs, or ladders.  I liked this match.
William Regal vs. Tajiri
Rating:  ***1/2
A lot of wrestling and martial arts mix in this match.  Tajiri is quick as always and Regal is a great match performer.  This was a good match.  Didn't like the finish but man these two are good wrestlers.  Check out the whelps on Regals chest after the match, that had to hurt.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho

My favorite match of the evening and the main reason I bought the DVD.  I really like Kurt Angle, he is a very good wrestler, and Chris Jericho is good too, that's why he's WCW Champ going into the match.

Not as good as the spectacular match they put on at WMX-7.  But it held up as a pretty good main event.  Same finish (slighty) as WMX-7 with Kurt Angle helpin' Austin out.
overall, this Even was pretty good, I saw it on the shelf at Suncoast, what caught my eye about this was the two Championship matches with Chris Jericho and Steve Austin defending their titles.  But for real I'm gettin' a little tired of Rock vs. Austin, it's gettin' old.  They coulda had Austin defend against someone else.  But I'm glad I added this to my collection.

The WWF Womens 4 way match was decent, giving the fact that it was involving strictly 4 womens wrestlers...

Russo cares more about story than  wrestling and it shows. In the undercard none of the matches are actively  bad, but neither are they good. They all are average matches, hovering  around **. (in this system, * is bad, ***** is a classic match)Also, the  goal of the evening is to make the Bulldog a major heel in the WWF, so look  for him to be involved all night.

7916423,3,B000031VPQ,"The WWF had a prominent presence in the UK with their pay-per-view events until 2003 when they elected to do international tours instead. Rebellion 2001 was a pretty strong event considering the UK events were widely known to be low priority for the WWF as it features several strong matches and very few filler superstars or matches.

The undercard does feature several low profile matches, but DDP/Big Show and Tajiri/Regal are short, modestly entertaining encounters that at least aren't offensively bad. The meat of the event boils down to three matches, all of which delivered and made this show worth watching.

Edge and Christian continued their rivalry in a Steel Cage match that got the crowd pumped for he rest of the card. Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle tussled over the WCW Title in a strong, athletic match with Jericho getting a lot of deserved attention as one of the top two guys at the time. The Rock and Steve Austin delivered an even more impressive main event considering how many times they've clashed before; they kept things fresh and still fulfilled all the requirements for a WWF style classic.

Rebellion isn't a great event, but it stacks up rather well to events from, say, 2005 or 2006 where there were a lot of filler matches on the undercard. It may not have been great in 2001, but it stands up well looking back in 2014.",1409788800,,1351,4.716101694915254

1.) Steel Cage Match for Intercontinental Championship- Edge vs Christian: After a brawling battle at Unforgiven and a grueling Ladder Match at No Mercy, Edge and Christian settle the score once and for all here at Rebellion! This match wasn't nearly as good as their match at No Mercy, but it's still up there. A noteworthy thing about this match is that the steel link cage was replaced with the old school iron bar cage. The match goes back and forth and the way the match ends is perhaps one of the most cleverest ways I've ever seen a steel cage match won.  Rating: 4/5

2.) Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Hurricane: This match starts off kind of slow but picks up towards the end. I however, just couldn't get interested in the match.  Rating: 3/5

3.) Big Show vs DDP- This was nothing more than a squash match for the show. I really don't even know why this match was written on the script. It was a waste of time.  Rating: 2/5

4.) Triple Threat Elimination Tag Team Match for WCW Tag Team Titles- The Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz vs APA: The PPV picks up again here. After the APA got eliminated, the Hardys and Dudleys put on a very good tag match. A table gets introduced but doesn't get used. Still a pretty good tag team match up.  Rating: 4/5

5.) William Regal vs Tajiri: A nice technical match. Nothing more to be said.  Rating: 4/5

6.) Kurt Angle vs Chris Jericho for WCW World Heavyweight Title: Any time Jericho and Angle throw down in the ring, you know you're going to see a great match. This match is very good with both men using a variety of moves to ground each other. Kurt Angle proves himself worthy of a heel based on his tactics throughout the match as well as his post match attack on Jericho.  Rating: 5/5

7.) Might Molly and Stacy Keibler vs Torrie Wilson and Lita w/Trish Stratus as the Special Referee: Nothing to really point about about this match except for how bad it is. Trish is a horrible ref as she acts completely oblivious to the 2 on 1 attacks Stacy and Molly perform throughout the match. What's even worse is the fact that Stacy stands in a corner and watches Molly be pinned and blames Trish for the loss afterwords.  Rating: 1/5

8.) Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock for the WWF Championship: This match was almost as good as their Wrestlemania X7 match but not nearly as brutal, but I won't complain. Rock and Austin take this match practically all around the arena. From the top of the stage to ringside and we even get a little blood during the match. This was a great back and forth personal match between the 2 top stars of the Attitude Era that even sees a run-in from Angle and Jericho which plays the outcome of the match.  Rating: 5/5

Overall: This was a decent PPV that only had a couple bad matches that really shouldn't have been on the show. Replace those bad matches with matches featuring stars such as Kane, Booker T, RVD, and Undertaker and Rebellion would be an A+ PPV. Either way it was still fair and I'd rate it with a 4/5",1356480000,,3218,4.336666666666667

The worst matches were the Big Show-DDP match which was one-sided at best and the Divas tag team match between the team of Torrie Wilson & Lita & the team of Stacy Keibler & Mighty Molly with Trish Stratus as guest referee which was not great but still pretty lousy. The 3 way tag team match for the WCW tag team championship was a good soild bout for a 3 way. The Scotty 2 Hotty-Hurricane match was fun match to see if you are between the ages of 1 and 8. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1277856000,,909,4.290697674418604
7916426,4,B000031VPQ,"Just in case if you do not know, Rebellion along with Insurrextion are WWF's PPV events for England. This is another good PPV from the Ivasion period. It carried over some storylines and feuds from No Mercy to the Survivor Series event. The two World Title matches are very good and the under-card isn't so bad either.

Steel Cage Match for the IC Title
Edge (C) vs. Christian
This feud played off pretty well. But this match certainly didn't live up to their Ladder Match from No Mercy. Some good spots with the cage. No blood in this one but still good. And the ending is something we haven't seen yet since. 4/5

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Hurricane Helms
I was really impressed with this match. It started out slow but picked up as the match progressed. Some very good counters and reversals towards the end and this match played out to be pretty decent. 3/5

Big Show vs. DDP
A very short match. DDP's run after the Invasion and Summerslam PPVs went really bad in my opinion. And this match was really weak. These two had better in their old WCW days. 2/5

Elimination Tag Team Match for the WCW Tag Team Titles
Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (C) vs. APA
The PPV picks up again here. After the APA got eliminated, the Hardys and Dudleys put on a very good tag match. A table gets introduced but doesn't get used. Still a pretty good tag team match up. 3.5/5

William Regal vs. Tajiri
A very good mat based and ground based match up. Regal looked to be in very good shape here. A very good match. 4/5

WCW Heavyweight Title
Chris Jericho (C) vs. Kurt Angle
This match came about after Angle defected just a week earlier. This match went very good with both men suplexing and slamming each other. To include a little nice brawl on the outside. Angle is very good as a heel and him and Jericho meshed in very well with each other. Just a solid wrestling match. 5/5

Divas Tag Team Match with Trish Stratus as the Special Referee
Lita and Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler and Mighty Molly
I found this match not good at all. Even with Trish as the special ref. This match just didn't do it for me. 1.5/5

WWF Title
The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (C)
Great match but doesn't quite equal to their classic from Wrestlemania earlier in the year. This match got taken almost everywhere. It would even get a little brutal. This was a good back and forth confrontation from these two great rivals. A very good match showing for the WWF Title. 5/5

The Extra's aren't so bad either. They hold two very good matches and also Kurt Angle defecting to the Alliance.

WCW Heavyweight Title From RAW 11.5.01
The Rock vs. Chris Jericho (C)
Another good match showing from these two for the WCW Title. Not as good as from their No Mercy encounter but still very good nevertheless. This match seemed very personal. It has a good table spot and some blood too. And the after match assault to The Rock added more as well. 4.5/5

Smackdown 11.8.01
Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle
Another good match right here. Austin and Angle had just previously took out Kane the past RAW. And Taker was here for revenge and he gave Austin and Angle a run for their money. Good match and watch out for Austin stunning Angle. 3.5/5

I recommend purchasing Rebellion '01. The two World Title matches are great and the extra's make up for the decent mid-card.",1235433600,2,3338,4.436274509803922
7916427,3,B000031VPQ,"Look, anybody can read the following reviews and see who wins and loses, so I'll give you my impressions of the show as a whole.

Rebellion 2001 comes in the midst of the ""WCW Invasion"" storyline that pitted The WWE (named the WWF at the time) against an upstart group of young talent representing WCW or World Championship wrestling.

While their are stronger Pay-Per-Views that exploit this storyling, namely the apt-titled ""Invasion"" of July 2001, WWF Rebellion has two things going for it that other PPVs do not. 1) It took place in England, and was never shown in the US and 2) Features a match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rock, arguably the two biggest stars of this generation.

WWF/E Rebellion is a strong PPV, but not an overly memorable one sans the Rock/Austin match. It's still worthy of being in your collection, however.",1233187200,,842,4.7534246575342465
7916428,4,B000031VPQ,"I don't have any creative way to introduce this DVD.  I'll just say that the PPV starts rough & ends very strong, while the DVD includes some excellent bonus material.  So, let's not waste any more time:

PPV REVIEW

1) Steel Cage Match - WWF Intercontinental Championship
Christian (WWF European champion) v.
Edge (WWF Intercontinental champion)
---Let's cut to the chase: I really don't like this match very much.  Considering the exceptional encounters these two had at UNFORGIVEN and NO MERCY, I expected a lot more.  But the whole match is a series of fits and starts.  Just when it gets good, the whole thing slows down to more weak holds and weak takedowns.  The last few minutes are pretty exciting, and the finish is still (to my knowledge) unique to this particular Cage Match.  But I watched this twice to see if I just missed something.  Maybe the third time will be the charm?
""6.0 / 10""

2) Scotty 2 Hotty v. The Hurricane
---Okay, the good news is that this match is a lot more fun to watch than it looks in print.  These two wrestlers were a couple of the goofiest of the Fed's talent roster, but they actually went out and tried to have a decent match.  For the most part, it's pretty solid.  The only real problem I have with this contest is the same I had with the opening Steel Cage Match: a tad slow & a tad soft.  Plus, The Worm is the stupidest friggin' finisher in pro wrestling history.  PERIOD!
""6.5 / 10""

3) DDP v. Big Show
---Unlike other reviewers, I don't know whether the WCW encounters between these two were any good.  I actually didn't hate this match as much as everyone else seems too, because it was meant to be a funny squash.  Pointless?  Yes, but I wasn't bored.
""5.0 / 10""

4) Elimination Match - WCW Tag Team Championships
The Dudley Boyz (champions) v. The APA v. The Hardy Boyz
---When all three teams are active, this match isn't very good.  Bradshaw was usually a fun superstar to watch back in 2001, but Ron ""Faarooq"" Simmons was way past his prime at this point, and it shows.  But once APA is out of the picture, The Hardyz & Dudleyz deliver an exceptional back-and-forth contest.  And it wasn't the same old routines between either team; I saw some counters and double-teams I hadn't seen either team use against each other before.  You might not like the first few minutes, but once APA is gone, things get really good.
""7.0 / 10""

5) William Regal (WCW/ECW Alliance Commissioner) v. Tajiri
---Like everyone else has said, this little grudge match not only wipes the floor with their future SURVIVOR SERIES encounter, but is a remarkable contest worthy of any PPV.  The whole match is flatout rough, and stiff as hell.  These guys don't seem to pull pack on their submission holds, takedowns, or strikes.  A very good showing from both men.
""7.0 / 10""

6) WCW Championships
Kurt Angle (WCW United States champion)
v. Chris Jericho (WCW champion)
---One of the greatest matches I've ever seen!  If either Angle or Jericho get a WWE DVD that celebrates their career, this match belongs on them.  What stands out to me is the endless arsenal of moves these two men utilize.  I don't think I saw the same submission hold used more than once.  The finishers weren't overused, or over-attempted for that matter.  The action was back-and-forth, constantly.  When the pace was slow, it was exhilerating.  The UK crowd ate this whole match up from start to finish.  Other than a strange aftermath, -- and possibly a shorter-than-expected time length -- this is a near-perfect display of why I love pro wrestling.  This exceptional contest is the only reason you need to buy the REBELLION 2001 DVD.
""9.5 / 10""

7) Special Referee - Trish Stratus
Mighty Molly & Stacy Keibler v. Torrie Wilson & Lita
---I don't hate Divas matches, really.  They have their audience, and can be fun from time to time.  Heck, I even think the Bra-and-Panties Match from the INVASION PPV is criminally underrated.  But this whole tag team contest is sloppy and pointless.  I can't even describe what I didn't like about it, because there's not much to say.  Lita and Molly are (or were) excellent athletes, and Torrie & Stacy have a couple good matches to their name.  But this whole affair is pointless, boring, and over before you know it.
""4.0 / 10""

8) WWF Championship
""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (champion) v. The Rock
---I need to give you a little history before I talk about this main event.  I think Rock/Austin matches are very overrated.  I like them, but don't they're nearly as great as every other wrestling fan does.  However, this particular one really entertained me.  At first, we get the usual Rock/Austin cliches.  The fistfight starts the same as all the others.  They fight up the entrance ramp.  There's a reversed suplex on the stage.  One guy drinks some water, only to spit it at the other guy.  C'mon, you know this is true to some degree.  But about halfway through, the match actually showed me a few tricks I hadn't seen Austin & Rock use on each other.  I can't really explain it, but there seemed to more use of in-ring psychology than the straight-up brawls we usually get from these two.  The counters were more unusual than I'd seen before, and Austin's ground offense was more aggressive than usual.  Also, I think the final moments were more breathtaking than any other Rock/Austin showdown.  In so many ways, this REBELLION DVD is a perfect tie-in to the SURVIVOR SERIES 2001 PPV, and this main event is the key example.  I'm so surprised by how much I liked this main event that I'm going to give the other Rock/Austin battles another look.
""8.0 / 10""

***********************************
DVD EXTRAS
---The DVD features can be separated in two categories:
1) You get several video montages that you'll view on the PPV anyway.
2) You get two solid bonus matches.

The first bonus match is on the RAW that followed REBELLION.  The Rock and Chris Jericho compete for almost 30 minutes, with Rock winning the WCW Title back from Y2J.  Not quite as good (in my opinion) as their PPV matches before and after this TV main event, but still an incredible faceoff.

The second bonus match is on the following SMACKDOWN.  The Undertaker competes in a Handicap Match against Kurt Angle & Steve Austin.  This contest lasts about 12 minutes, and doesn't let up from the opening bell.  Angle & Austin can't get along, which allows Taker to survive the odds better than he probably should've.  And when Angle & Austin are in control, the match is never dull.

***********************************
OVERALL
---The REBELLION PPV starts off very rough, especially with a disappointing Steel Cage Match from Edge and Christian.  However, about halfway through, the card becomes well worth your money.  And then when the event is over -- which is only about 135 minutes, by the way -- you get two great bonus matches to sink your teeth into.  REBELLION 2001 might not be a great PPV, but it's still an excellent purchase.  Not only does the DVD make a nice little bridge to the SURVIVOR SERIES that ended the Invasion angle, but it also includes four terrific matches that you can't get on any other WWE DVD.",1222300800,2,7181,4.666666666666667
7916429,4,B000031VPQ,"Out of all of the international events that weren't shown in the United States, this was the best event that the WWF had & one of the events to come out of the Invasion angle.

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Edge vs Christian. This match used the previous cage formula by having the original black-barrred cage & just like the one between Bret/Owen, this was a great wrestling match with the cage coming into effect at one point or another.

Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Hurricane. This match was actually given a surprise amount of time for it to turn into something more than just a filler as this was a good wrestling match that went back & forth between both men.

DDP vs Big Show. These two had better matches in WCW as DDP's WWF run didn't go as well as we expected as this was just a short comedic squash.

Elimination Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz vs APA. This was one of those matches that actually got better as time went on but this was really just a decent tag team at best. However, we all know that whenever the Hardyz & the Dudleyz are in the ring, you will never be left disappointed.

William Regal vs Tajiri. Two underrated performers here have the ""sleeper"" match of the night as this was a great match with Regal's stiff mat-grappling style meshing well with Tajiri's japanese style but check out some of the stiff kicks & chops from Tajiri that left Regal's chest a bloody red.

WCW Champion Chris Jericho vs Kurt Angle. Kurt joined the Alliance so he is complete heel mode here. This match gets overshadowed by some of their earlier matches but I felt that this match was better than all of those as these two put on a great wrestling match with both men countering each other's moves & even using submission attempts that they have not used before.

Lita & Torrie Wilson vs Mighty Molly & Stacy Keibler w/Special Referee Trish Stratus. This was nothing really special past being an average match that actually showed signs of the type of performer that Molly would soon become while Lita was still in her prime here.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock. This was their forgotten match in their classic series which is a shame because this was one of their best matches together. Austin was really aggressive here from the opening bell & in full heel mode that lead to some comedy moments as Austin taunted the crowd non-stop. This started as a brawl but soon turned into a great wrestling match with both men targeting each other's leg that actually lead to cameo appearances from Chris Jericho & Kurt Angle.

DVD extras include features that you would see during the event but also two bonus matches:

WCW Champion Chris Jericho vs The Rock. This happened on RAW following the event & even though they didn't top their No Mercy classic, these two put on a great performance here along with pushing the storyline of Rock & Jericho not getting along going into Survivor Series.

Undertaker vs Stone Cold & Kurt Angle. This happened on SmackDown right after the previous RAW match as it was non-stop action with Taker holding his own despite the number's game but pay close attention to the beginning & the aftermath of the match as it would really try to show you ""Who is really on whose's side?""

Overall, this event was worth the money & the wait as not only do you get a quality event but two bonus matches so I highly recommend this DVD to any fan.",1213574400,,3420,4.516181229773463
7916430,4,B000031VPQ,"During the WWF era, they were going thru the whole Invasion angle. The WWF rooster was stacked with talent. However, WWF didn't really know how to manage this talent. This PPV is more like a epsiode of Raw rather then a PPV.

Edge VS Christian in a Cage Match: I hate Edge but will give credit to him, this is probably the best ending to any cage match ive ever seen. A short match, alot of this matches were short.

Hurricane VS Scotty 2 Hotty: I cannot believe Hurricane lost to the worm.

DDP cuts a promo in his motivational phase. DDP was a excellent worker and was just one of many wrestlers who had talent but WWF didn't know how to handle them. Call me crazy but DDP would have been a excellent world champion in WWF but they still had Rock and Austin, so DDP could second hand titles.

DDP VS Big Show: A good match but way to short. Big Show wins even though DDP could have easily won.

The Hardys VS Dudleys VS APA: A pretty good match.

William Regal VS Tajiri: A good but anther short match. I don't know why these matches were so short.

Jeez, Kurt Angle use to cut a hell of a promo. I miss these phase of Angle's career. Of course, WWF had alot of wrestlers could cut funny promos in this era.

Chris Jericho VS Kurt Angle: An alright match. Endings to England PPV's world title matches seem to be different then Ameircan endings.

Rock cuts a promo. I miss this guy, he is what WWF needs. Damn Hollywood.
Not his best promo though.

Lita @ Torrie Wilson VS Mighty Molly @ Stacy Keibler: I don't know why England ppv's have these matches towards the end. Skip for an ale.

Steve Austin VS The Rock: Liked the back story, these two never disappoint. Too bad the ending sucked.

Extra matches are pretty good: Rock VS Jericho for the WCW title in a match that was better then the whole PPV. Rock won the title but I don't think the WCW title meant much at this time. Sould have given DDP a run with it. At least for a few weeks.

Undertaker VS Anfle and Austin: A short match that ends with a roll up. I hate when matches end that way, sometimes its good but most, its bad.

The also have a promo of Rock-Austin from WrestleMania X7 and Angle defecting to the alliance.

Overall,  its worth getting. Rock VS Jericho match is well worth it and thats an extra!",1210809600,,2272,4.236658932714617
