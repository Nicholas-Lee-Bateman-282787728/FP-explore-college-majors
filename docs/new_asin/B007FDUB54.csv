8515627,1,B007FDUB54,"I am sorry to report this four set of cd's are not what I had in mind when I purchased this item.  First of all I was under the impression that this was for all levels of guitar players.  It is not! Really this is not set up to instruct, but rather a forum for one of the instructors to show boat his playing.  There are four cd's with only four ""courses"" on each cd, that is a total of 16 lessons fi my math is correct.  That is also pretty lame for the amount of money I shelled out for this set of ""proven learning methods.""  I am a novice when it comes to playing. I was hoping to bring myself up to be able to play some of the music that I love.  I again am very disappointed in the content of these cd's.  I would not recommend these for someone who has very little knowledge and experience. The Next Level Guitar cd's will make you feel like you will never learn to play the guitar at all.  I believe that the instructors are both great guitar players, but not such great teachers.",1413590400,4,988,4.030769230769231
