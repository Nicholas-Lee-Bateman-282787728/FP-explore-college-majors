5016911,5,B006TTC5GS,"Let me tell you, these movie rock. My favorite movie in there is The Blues Brother because its my favorite SNL characters in action to save a church. National Lampons Animal House was amazing and I couldn't stop laughing. The Jerk is a personal favorite and I'm so happy i can watch in when ever i want now and Car Wash was good but nothing compared to the other three movies but it's still good. I think you just love the other three movies so much the Car Wash really isn't the best in there but its still good. For anyone who thinks John Belushi isn't good you should watch Animal House and Blues Brothers because they are amazing and you will change your mind instantly. BELUSHI ROCKS",1388620800,,688,4.3828125

5016917,5,B006TTC5GS,"This is a good collection of classic comedies from Universal. Animal House and Blues Brothers are true classics and are hilarious (everyone miss John Belushi?). The Jerk is an interesting movie with Steve Martin playing the gullible, village idiot so well (his fake drunk voice is horrible and quite annoying). Car Wash was definitely my least favorite of the four. I think it's interesting that Richard Pryor is listed as essentially the main character (the way it's promoted), yet he has what a 5 minute cameo part in the entire movie that comes with no lead-up and leaves with no follow-up. Overall really good collection of classic comedies with legendary comedians.",1363046400,6,670,5.045045045045045

I couldn't afford to buy them right there, so I looked for a used copy online and found a copy here for less than $10--and that's including the shipping & handling! The only disappointment is the edition of The Blues Brothers is the expanded version and not anniversary edition that has both the original theatrical version and the longer cut. Other than that, a fine package and more affordable than getting them separately.",1351728000,2,573,4.519230769230769
