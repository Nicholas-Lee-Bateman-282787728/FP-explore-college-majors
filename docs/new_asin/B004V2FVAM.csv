After watching the movie, I think that there should be a type ""reincarnation"" in your genre section. It is because the story of the movie revolves around reincarnation of Prabhat (Biswajeet) and Reshma (Nishi). Howerver, commenting about the movie, I will say that the movie was good to watch for one time. It cannot be rated as above average but if you have not watched it, at least watch it for one time. You will not feel bored. The music was not out standing but O.K. In fact I did not like the music while watching the movie. The acting was good. The dialogues were also good. The picturisation was also nice in the green hills of Himachal Pradesh (although the movie was Black & White). Mehmood, as a comedian did a very good job. The best thing of the movie was its script. The script is basically what is shown in the movie. So, the script was very good.",1304985600,,900,4.421686746987952
