I ordered this DVD a while ago. It was duly delivered but on trying to play it (on three different DVD players) I discovered there was no soundtrack for The Road to Bali. My Favorite Brunette did have a soundtrack, as did the menu screen - which had a clip of The Road to Bali, complete with sound. I returned the DVD and Amazon sent me another. Same fault. Amazon finally credited me with the cost of the DVD.
I had never heard of Wienerworld UK, under whose banner the DVD was issued. I was prepared to give an unknown a try. Never again.",1240617600,2,795,5.737288135593221
