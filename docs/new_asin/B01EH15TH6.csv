8758727,5,B01EH15TH6,Stumbled across this Gem of an Anime' series. Imagine a world where schoolgirls battle each other in tanks! The graphic representations of real WWII era armor is in itself worth getting the series. The story line gives it the feel of what they would consider as life at school. Would have liked to have been the one to come up with the idea. Love it!,1506988800,,350,4.4

8758729,5,B01EH15TH6,"I'm also not an anime fan but this series is terrific! Once you accept entry into the Girls und Panzer universe--where high school girls' teams practice ""Sensha-do,"" The Way of the Tank--a marvelous world opens up. For those who like military affairs, the tanks and tank combat are done with meticulous detail. (There must be some military experts affiliated with the production...) However, if female bonding is more your cup of tea, then know that the relationships between the girls (and their mothers!) are developed with depth and tenderness. This 2012 television series is as much about the importance of friendship and family as it is about tank battle tactics. On the whole, an intelligent and witty creation with much to offer an interested viewer. (PS, the show's producers went on to make a full-length 2015 feature movie called Girls und Panzer der Film.)",1472169600,,867,5.027777777777778
8758730,4,B01EH15TH6,"While not normally a fan of anime, the premise of this one really intrigued me when a member of my modeling club brought it to a meeting. After loaning me his copy, I ended up buying one for myself. It is aimed at roughly a ""tweens"" age group (not that its ever too late to have a happy childhood) and the episodes tend to be morality plays. Still, as the series progresses, I found myself falling into the show to see how the teams matured and interacted.  If you find the concept of high school girls intramural tank warfare an intriguing concept, I suspect you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",1471996800,,593,4.294642857142857
