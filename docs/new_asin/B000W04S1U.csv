2959154,5,B000W04S1U,I was not expecting much from this dvd but was surprised it was so funny.  Make sure your bong is packed for this one.,1369267200,2,118,3.9166666666666665
2959155,2,B000W04S1U,"I heard about this movie a few years ago on an AC/DC site that stated Brian Johnson had given a few freebie songs to this movie. I've listened to ""Who Phoned the Law"" and ""Chase that Tail"" for a while now, and really loved the songs, so after hearing them again the other day, I decided I should hunt down that movie they came from and check it out.

I guess with the name ""Totally Baked"" I expected this to maybe be on the same page as ""Half Baked"" but soon discovered after a few seconds of viewing, this was not a movie, it's a documentary, although they have tried to insert some pretty terrible acting scenes into the thing to make it seem like a comedic film about the positives aspects and lies about Marijuana. However, some of it I doubt is actual evidence or truth, but seeing it presented in a skit instead of a narrated seriously over factual footage, I guess it was kind of a different approach to the matter, so it's nothing like ""How High"". However, it is still pretty campy and lame.

If you want some gist of a plot, a couple of pro marijuana activists hold up a house filled with a bunch of people having a school reunion, and along the way point out facts like alcohol and tobacco cause X amounts of death a year, and pot causes 0, then blabs on about something related to dope being illegal because the paper manufacturing companies wanted the monopoly on normal paper instead of stronger paper, or something like that, somehow I think this may be a load of bull, yet it may have it's factual parts to it, but it's hard to tell what is fact and what is just stupid attempts at failed humor.

As I said, i was looking forward to hearing those songs from Brian Johnson, and if you cough, you will miss them, so don't go in expecting a kick a soundtrack to the film, it's all overshadowed by the mediocre attempt of their own version of the Cheech & Chong song ""Up in Smoke"". It also surprised me that there is a few well known faces during this pot-u-mentry, however I do not see it doing anything positive for their career acting wise. I think during this whole ordeal of the same lines rehashed over and over again, I laughed maybe once or twice, but not in hysterics, just a mild chuckle. So don't expect a cult happening for this movie and regarded in 20 years time as not just a stoner comedy, but a classic comedy in itself.

Amongst the thing is clips of various known and unknown comedians doing pot jokes, probably the most recognized would be Jackie ""The Joke Man"" Martling"" who delivers a joke far from any of his best material, not even his mid-card stuff for that matter...

Overall, if you can't get enough of the pro marijuana documentary, then you probably have seen this already, and know that rating this any higher then 3 stars is a joke, anyone giving it higher is either high themselves, or will just give a high rating to ANYTHING that glorifies their green friends of nature. And now i end here not having given my opinion on if i think marijuana is good, bad, or should or should not be illegal which is going to confuse the hell of you people reading this just looking for something about it to judge if this review if helpful or not? :D :D :D",1294444800,,3186,4.3389261744966445
