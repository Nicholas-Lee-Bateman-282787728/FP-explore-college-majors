8333304,5,B001PHP9TY,Teaches a lot of cool and crazy elbows I've never seen before. Most R ancient techniques long forgotten. Mostly for military or lethal application not really for combat sports but half of them could be used 4 sports.,1440547200,,216,4.7105263157894735

8333306,5,B001PHP9TY,"Incredible video.  I have multiple videos by Arjan De Cesaris.  He is awesome!. Really great illustration of the forms.  More importantly, how to use them in real Self defense situations.

A must for anyone looking to be lethal in close.",1424563200,2,237,4.85
8333307,5,B001PHP9TY,It really is hard to find books/DVDs on the subject of old style Muay Thai and I must say I am glad that I made this purchase. Of course you can only do so much on your own without a partner but it does lay down the proper use of these strikes. And on another note for those that don't know most of these elbows strikes are really meant for warfare/street application so don't expect to try most of these out sparring in your Muay Thai class lol.,1318291200,,446,4.079545454545454
8333308,5,B001PHP9TY,"Outstanding!!!  This is just what I was looking for.  I always knew that elbow boxing in muay thai was more developed than what you see in the thai boxing.  The techniques in this video are very dangerous, and that's why professional fighters don't use them in the ring.  Muay boran and thai boxing are very different.  Thai boxing only deals with the basic elbow strikes allowed in the ring.  Boran unlocks the full use of the elbows, and Ajarn Marco and his partner give a good visual of how to execute all of the elbow strikes in traditional muay thai.  Then he gives combo's and blocking techniques.

After you get comfortable with the basics, you can develop your own combo's. A master elbow boxer doesn't need to throw a punch. Never mind a thousand kicks on the heavy bag, muay boran is real street fighting.  Be careful with these techniques as you can really hurt somebody.  By far the best $30 I have ever spent.",1300406400,7,922,4.533333333333333
