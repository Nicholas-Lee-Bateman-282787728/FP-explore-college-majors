8586983,4,B00CWMZRPM,"I've been using Kristin's yoga workouts for 11 years. Least favorite is ""MTV Power Yoga"" (music is a bit jarring, sometimes awkward transitions between intense asanas), favorite is ""Power Yoga"" (nice pace, good instruction and breath cues). Yoga slim was a good adjunct with some new advanced poses and flows for me. This workout could've been my new favorite if she didn't move through the poses so quickly, especially in some of the stretches. The setting is really nice, but the camera jumps around quite a bit and it's distracting.

Otherwise, I do appreciate how short, yet comprehensive, this vinyasa flow is.",1471996800,,615,5.029411764705882
8586984,5,B00CWMZRPM,"Very challenging yoga routine.  It is a great workout, not a calming, relaxing yoga routine.  She does move fast, and it takes a while to keep up, but that is what makes it great.  Practice, Practice, Practice.
Kristin is a wonderful instructor - motivating, but not annoying.
Highly Recommend",1440201600,,293,4.938775510204081
8586985,1,B00CWMZRPM,She moved very fast from one pose to the next.  I've been doing yoga for years and found it difficult to move so quickly.  Did not love it.,1424217600,,139,3.9285714285714284
8586986,4,B00CWMZRPM,Very fast paced yoga flow but not boring and it's short and sweaty - which is just what I like.,1409097600,,95,3.8
8586987,5,B00CWMZRPM,"I have doing Kristin McGee's ""Power Yoga"" video for over a year now, and being familiar with her usual cues, I found this video not too difficult to follow. This particular video is definitely not for the beginner Yogi, as other reviewers have stated, but for a strong intermediate, I really like this video and am glad for the advanced positions to work towards! I have only had this video for a few weeks and I already notice a difference in my abs/waist line! Highly recommend!",1402704000,3,480,4.593023255813954
8586988,3,B00CWMZRPM,"I consider myself a yoga intermediate, not advanced by any means but found this workout a challenge, not only for the poses but for the quick movement through them. I understand the transitions make for the aerobic part of the workout but she moves too fast with little pose hold time and when she introduces advanced moves, she goes right into them without demonstrating or even mentioning an alternative pose. This was the most frustrating of all. I really enjoy the DVDs (and YouTube) of Sadie Nardini and enjoy Brian Kest, Baron Baptiste, Rodney Ye Power, Sean Corne, Travis Eliot and Kathryn Budig (she does advanced moves but offers many variations with AimTrue). I don't know if it was just my DVD but the sound of Pilates portion was bad, like she was filmed in a metal drum. I love her workouts from MTV and will hope for an improvement in her next release.",1400544000,5,866,4.62987012987013
8586989,5,B00CWMZRPM,I adore Kristin McGee!  She is a great teacher both in person and in her videos.  Her enthusiasm is infectious!  Yoga Slim offers a great workout in a short amount of time.  It definitely gets my heart rate up with the fast-paced flow.  I incorporate this DVD in my at-home practice at least once a week and feel stronger and leaner each time I complete it.,1396828800,,357,4.348484848484849
8586990,5,B00CWMZRPM,"I am a huge Kristin McGee fan - ever since her MTV series. She packs so much into a short time! This workout is 25 minutes and leaves me limber and radiant. Kristin's personality and exceptional cueing put this DVD in the ""must have"" category.  I would rate myself an intermediate yogi and am challenged every time I have the pleasure to do this DVD. I will buy anything Kristen McGee does!",1389052800,3,390,4.416666666666667
8586991,3,B00CWMZRPM,"I've been doing yoga off and on for 20 years. I mostly use Travis Eliot DVDs, and I learned proper yoga and breathing from the superb Alan Finger series, and from Kripalu videos from the '90s. I rely on the meticulous cueing of those videos and DVDs, and from the careful word enunciation those instructors incorporate in their instruction. This DVD probably works for many people, but I had a more difficult time following it because it seemed hurried and I did not easily follow the instructor, as I felt she hurried and didn't enunciate well.",1387411200,5,545,4.6875
8586992,3,B00CWMZRPM,Many of the moves are not for beginners.  I was hoping to get a good workout but ended up a little frustrated.  A few more attempts may make it easier.,1375056000,,151,4.0
