1969703,1,B00013RBPI,"Very disappointed in this poorly made film.  Very little interesting information.  The information that is interesting is presented in an incoherent order.  Fails on every level.  Not sure what I paid to ""rent"" this awful film, but it should have been priced at .99 cents so that I would not feel completely ripped off.  I promise you can read a Wikipedia article and watch a youtube video and get more for your money!",1395446400,,418,4.671232876712328
1969704,5,B00013RBPI,"There's simply no bigger fan of Casino in the Universe than myself. At first, I wasn't all that impressed with this film it seemed too short. But, then after seeing a bunch of TV films on the real people on msnbc and A&e I realized this film was way better than I thought because it gave a more realistic bird's eye view of the so called 'outfit' and real people behind the film. If you just wanna know who's who and whatnot you can just read the book. But, I loved seeing stuff on the real Spilotro and learning how even the mob guys didn't like the real Lefty because he was an ego maniac, 'he knew bettrer than everybody else.' The mob boss interviewed here says he didn't like his arrogance. All the stuff about Dorfman the Alan King character was fascinating also. A lot of the interviews had me on the edge of my seat, it was impressive. If you're looking for more than just the facts then this is your film, had an interesting style as well.

I also highly recommend the new version that has two discs with the new, longer version as a bonus. It's outstanding, many new stills and footage. Awesome!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-Home-Years-Ago-THE-REAL-CASINO-2001/dp/B000R900PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back Home Years Ago: THE REAL CASINO (2001)</a>",1373500800,2,1310,5.0368663594470044
1969705,1,B00013RBPI,"My God, what a complete waste this was. It was 20 minutes long, totally uninformative and boring. I thought it was going to give more background as to the Casino story but it was just all fluff. Not even entertaining fluff!
Bunch of interviews of guys in the dark in those shadowy anonymous settings that they do to conceal the ID of people being interviewed.  Not believable.
JUNK JUNK JUNK.
Please do not waste your time or money. If it was FREE I'd counsel you against watching it.",1369440000,,484,4.5
1969706,5,B00013RBPI,"I think most folks are looking at this film the wrong way. First off the other version on VOD is a much better, detailed film.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Real-CASINO-Special-Edition-Bonus/dp/B00B9IY9Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Real CASINO Special Edition Bonus</a>&nbsp;Secondly, when you're dealing w/ those who really are connected to the 'outfit' it's not like people are gonna wear signs saying, ""Here I am."" No, there are no blueprints diagraming where the dead and buried bodies are. A factual exposition isn't the sole goal of this film. Simply put, Bill Roemer would've loved this film, if you don't know who he is, then you probably aren't gonna 'get' it.

This is an inside, impressionistic view of how the 'outfit' really works, and something of an alternative view from the gloss of Hollywood. And at the same time, it presents quite a bit of interesting info. on the real Lefty Rosenthal (DeNiro), Tony Spilotro (Pesci) and others. THE REAL CASINO lends a touch of tangability to CASINO that wasn't present for me the first time around. In many ways, getting to know what the reality behind the story is more frightening than either of Scorsese's mob movies (Casino and GoodFellas.)

In CASINO, the names and players in Scorsese's movie were all changed, but Alexandre sheds light on who the contributing players actually were. The Real Casino unfolds from Alexandre's point of view as he wanders Chicago interviewing relatives and listening to first hand accounts. Alexandre's first person perspective lends a Michael Moore feel without the hamperings of Michael Moore's self-indulgence, and in the end Alexandre's discoveries become our own. To drive home the correlations between fact and fiction, Alenandre was able to get the rights to footage from not only CASINO, but from other high profile crime movies including GOODFELLAS and Michael Mann's THIEF. Often, the stories being told don't exactly match there portrayal and it's interesting to note just how much was embellished or changed for the big screen. Along these lines, the most interesting and challenging aspect of the film is the investigation into how 'we' as an audience perceive the 'mob genre' film. Interviewing members of the film crew getting their reaction to the reality of the interviews, contrasts the sort of glossier embellishments of the genre. At times the filmmaker seems to having some fun with the 'made up' stuff as evidenced by the recreated 'pen scene' in Casino. We know Tony Spilotro (Pesci) didn't actually stab someone in the neck w/ a pen. The film's goal isn't to necessarily give you all the facts found in Pileggi's book, but to paint an interesting version of what the players were like, and mob reality vs. mob reelity if you will.

Also, the latter section about the 'life' and 'street tax' aren't wiseguy tactics usually covered in other docs. They don't usually use tactics like that in Tumbleweed, TX or Green Bay hey:) It also goes into the tension in Italian neighborhoods when it comes to La Cosa Nostra. It's one of the first documentaries I've seen that has dealt w/ this pushback against the mob. Yes, they served a purpose, but they were not only feared but sometimes despised 'back home'. Also, some of the personality quirks and first hand accounts of people who really grew up w/ those in question were mesmerizing. In one of the first hand accounts, one of the guys who grew up around Alan Dorfman (Alan King) and had lunch w/ he and his son just a few days before he was 'clipped' outside a hotel in Lincolnwood, IL. These are the kind of things I want in a doc like this, not a bunch of dates and so forth. Unfortunately, there's always going to be some knuckleheads who don't 'get' the value of a film like this. It's the exact same reason Martin Scorsese's early films like Mean Streets, Raging Bull, and even GoodFellas to a lesser extent, never found a wider audience. Simply, because most folks in middle America just don't have a feel for this kind of urban material. But thank god we have smaller docs like this, it goes so much deeper than the usual A&E or CNBC stuff. This is real film-making.",1364515200,2,4188,4.997134670487106
1969707,2,B00013RBPI,"This ""film"" contains interviews of four or five unidentified or poorly-identified people who are ostensibly connected to the real-life people behind the characters of Casino by their statements only.  There's the bald guy with the silly goatee who likes to brag about how dangerous Chicago is; the Wheeling, IL sandwich shop owner who takes roughly 10 minutes of the 25-minute running time talking tough about how he wouldn't pay protection money because he had a gun; the blacked-out self-proclaimed former associate of Lefty Rosenthal whose only revelation is that Lefty's middle name was Larry; a woman who remembered going to Vegas as a little girl; and a chubby guy wearing a taxi driver's cap who claims he had lunch with Alan Dorfman as a twelve-year-old two days before he was killed.

Notice how almost none of this has to do with Rosenthal, Spilotro, or Las Vegas?  To remedy that, the director throws in about 60 seconds of disparate news footage of Rosenthal, Spilotro, and the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.  Since that's not enough to pad the very thin amount of information here, he also cuts in snippets from the movie Casino, from Goodfellas, and--for some reason--from James Caan's Thief just for good measure.  It is all jumbled together without context across jump cuts and slow-motion footage of the camera crew setting up in a motel room.

There is zero information in this documentary, just a set of blowhards speaking unconvincingly about things they may or may not know about.  Wikipedia has more information on the real story behind Casino than this project.",1362960000,,1576,5.038461538461538

8006157,3,B00013RBPI,"They kept repeating the same things over again and again. The few good things were this ""mysterious"" middle aged woman who was somehow related to someone from the movie casino or an associate,they never say, kept  saying ""People think its all glamorous but they don't realize the carnage done to the families."" They kept showing more of Joe Pesci than the character he portrayed. The 3 main characters giving their take/interview on it were not even made guys or associates but just people who grew up in the neighborhood in Chicago where the Casino characters were from. Some of their opinions were interesting for a minute or 2, but i am angry at Amazon for charging 2 bucks for  a 25 minute movie. Thats more per minute than any movie shown on Amazon! And it was just ok.  The best part was the last sentence. Because it was repeated twice in the movie. See if you catch the beauty of how they timed it so well.

 It was as if they were telling us a great truth vegas big shots knew for years ""What goes on in Vegas, stays in Vegas.."" In other words, we should be lucky we even got a snippett of what we saw. Oh and one thing that was interesting was that The real Frank Rosenthal was as arrogant and  unlikable as he was in the movie played by Dinero./ And I remember Dinero saying he fired his black jack dealer for kissing his wifes hand and saying she looks very beautiful in front of him. Makes me wonder about the basement and hammer part. We will never know,bet on that! And my guess is, if that didn't happen, Lefty probably fired  so many hard working people for the stupidest infractions because he was a Hitler according to what 2 people here say about him. Funny 85% of this movie is on heresay about what the neighborhood in Chicago was like where Lefty,Nicky Santoro and the other characters from the movie grew up. Im never renting a 25 min movie again. That right there tells you they had so little real information. This would be good as a bonus if you buy the movie CASINO.  Im starting to see Amazon charging some hefty prices for movies. Bet this hits them in the face pretty soon.",1399939200,,2104,4.390745501285347
