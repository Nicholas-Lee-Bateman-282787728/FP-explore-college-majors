1413053,5,B00005A8S3,"Hi everybody. Joe Camp here. I am so excited to see Benji in HD and Widescreen, the way I remember it from theaters back in the day. (Only the orange cover version is the new HD Widescreen restoration on Blu-Ray and DVD). Of course, I'm somewhat biased, but I still wonder how we managed to accomplish some of the things we did. And I'm so proud and blessed that it has been hailed by so many critics as possibly the best family film of all time, and remains one of the best loved films for audiences of all ages. Oprah and Steven Spielberg are among those who testify that Benji is their favorite big screen animal. I'd love to hear what you think. - Joe Camp

PS: The other blu-ray version is from a previous distributor and is not Widescreen or High Definition.",1511308800,,764,4.3426573426573425

1413074,4,B00005A8S3,I read a reviewer say that this is the best family movie of all time.  And it might be.  If you love dogs.  This isn't sad like Old Yeller.  It's just a little movie filmed in Denton Texas about a dog who rams all over town.  And knows where to stop and get food.  He always stops at one house with two kids a brother and a sister.  Who want to keep him.  But their Father won't let them.  The kids get kidnapped by some not too menacing bad guys.  And as the movie goes along Benji leads the police to the kidnappers.  And the Father changes his mind.  You really have to see this movie to know how good it really is.,1478390400,,618,3.934959349593496

1413096,2,B00005A8S3,"Others have written reviews for the movie itself. I'll say briefly that it's a good, clean, G-rated family film, and if you grew up in the 1970s you'll remember the look and feel of small town America, the cars, styles and mannerisms of people from that period. The story's pacing is slow by today's standards, almost boring, and the acting is so bad that the dog is the only character in the film who's convincing, but all that be darned, it's still a good movie.

""Benji"" was a cultural phenomenon in its day. Made on a shoestring budget by an independent filmmaker, the movie grossed almost $40 million domestically. It was theatrically released in 1974 in a 1:85.1 aspect ratio. The theme song, ""I Feel Loved,"" sun by Charlie Rich, was nominated for an Oscar. For years afterward it was shown on TV as an afterschool movie. Two or three sequels were made, though none captured the magic of the original.

Given this movie's impressive history, I expected much from the Blu-Ray edition. I've watched Blu-Ray recordings of other movies from the 1970s that were every bit as sharp and colorful as movies on the big screen today and hoped ""Benji"" would have gotten the white glove treatment here. Sadly, it didn't. The video is cropped to 4:3 aspect ratio, the image quality is mediocre at best and the colors are washed out. The DVD version of this movie probably looks every bit as good as the Blu-Ray. I've attached a few snapshots from my PC to demonstrate the poor sharpness and color saturation.

Maybe Joe Camp is holding out for Lucasfilm to digitally restore the movie and add in some CG dogs, but as it stands today I could not recommend this Blu-Ray for anyone wanting a high quality version of this beloved classic. Get the DVD and save a buck or two, and hope for a re-release some day.",1455494400,,1799,4.598130841121495

1413151,5,B00005A8S3,"What a wonderful family movie.  Higgins, the dog who starred in this movie, truly was the best dog actor who ever lived.  What looks simply like a camera following a stray dog around town, was the brilliant work of the dog trainer Frank Inn and ""his little brown dog"" Higgins.  There will never be an equal to the team of Inn and Higgins.  Never.  You didn't see Higgins watching the trainer off camera like other animal actors.  He was able to interact with the human actors and make it all look so believable.

This movie is a must for all families and dog lovers.",1418342400,,566,4.384615384615385

He acted with emotion you could sense. Human co-stars include the pretty Deborah Walley, and the wonderful Frances Bavier, who played Aunt Bee on The Andy Griffith Show.

 The film finds Benji walking around in rural Texas where he befriends two children and a female dog who looks like him. When the two children are kidnapped it is up to Benji to rescue them.

So last Christmas, we finally broke and bought it on DVD for her as she was wearing out the old VHS.

And the name is a little misleading, as the Christmas Story is only 26 minutes, so I'm not sure if I'd really call that a movie. Benji Off the Leash! from 2004 is presented in letterboxed widescreen, meaning it does not fill your screen as an enhanced/anamorphic version would. Also, there are no subtitles nor closed captioning and the only spoken language is the original English. There are no extras nor special features. The transfers are okay, but it doesn't look like anyone did much, if any, clean-up as there are noticeable specks, dust, dirt, what-have-you seen on the older films.

After Benji saved his children's lives when they were kidnapped by leading the father, housekeeper and police to where the kidnappers had taken the children is when the father changed his mind and decided to let the kids keep Benji as well as the other dog Benji had befriended, Tiffany.

1413285,4,B00005A8S3,"Growing up on live action dog films was one of the highlights of my childhood.  Films like Old Yeller, Milo & Otis and Benji were on constant rotation in my house, namely because my father loved dogs and so he was always in the mood to watch them with me.  Benji is one of those films that appealed to me I think more as a child than it does to me as an adult (whereas Old Yeller is the type of film that has continued to grow with me into adulthood) but there is no denying the impact that this furry little canine had on me then and the nostalgia of it all still gets me today.  The themes here are surprisingly fleshed out really well, and the action, which is centered on Benji and shot from his perspective, is remarkably focused.  I think director Joe Camp deserves a heap of praise for not only working so well with an animal, but for never compromising his vision because it may have been easier to do so.

1413287,2,B00005A8S3,"We streamed this from Amazon Prime - thought it would be a good movie for the kids especially since it is from thje 70's and from when we grew up.  The movie was painfully slow, however, my 10 yr old and 7 yr old didn't seem to notice it because the focus was on the dog just walking around for about the first quarter of the movie.  If your kids don't care much for animal movies they probably will notice this.  My wife and I kept looking at each other mouthing ""how long is this going to continue?""  It does.  But the kids seemed to like it until Benji's girlfriend gets kicked on purpose by the kidnapper and is shown just lieing there(you don't see it happen, but the lead up lets you figure it out.)  Well the flood gates opened to our surprise. Eventually they calmed down, but it could have been sooner if the movie moved along at a quicker pace.

If your kids like animal movies and can tolerate a painfully slow movie and won't go overboard if they understand a dog gets kicked, then they may like this.

1413297,4,B00005A8S3,"Before the chihuahuas went to Beverly Hills and before spot could run, there was a little mixed-breed dog named Benji, which has been played by four different dogs, Higgins, his daughter Benjean, and two other unnamed fluffy dogs. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released the two-disc Benji: 4 Movie Collection featuring the 1974 original Benji, the 1977 sequel For The Love of Benji, the 1978 special Benji's Very Own Christmas Story, and the 2004 sequel Benji Off the Leash!

In the original classic, Benji spends his day walking around a Texas town visiting his different human friends; all of them call him by a different name. His favorite house to visit belongs to Dr. Chapman, who happens to have two children, Paul and Cindy. The kids are the ones who named him Benji. They would love to keep him, but they are afraid their father wouldn't allow it. Benji befriends a female a dog, who is staying in an abandoned house, but a group of kidnappers arrive and Benji is the only one that can stop them.

A female dog, Benjean plays the title role in For The Love of Benji, which finds the loveable dog traveling with the Paul and Cindy Chapman and their nanny on a family vacation Greece. While in a pet carrier on the plane, a mysterious stranger leaves a tattoo on Benji's paw. Situations occur and Benji becomes lost in Athens, Greece as he tries to escape from a killer dog and outdo the spies.

Benji's Very Own Christmas Story aired on ABC in 1978 and was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Children's Program. Actresses Cindy Smith and Patsy Garret, along with Benji, are on a promotional tour in Switzerland, but they get sidetracked when they meet Kris Kringle (played by Ron Moody).

Benji disappeared for seventeen years until his return to be the big screen (limited run) in Benji Off the Leash!, where the producers are on a nationwide search for the next dog to be Benji. It tells an emotional story of a young mixed-breed dog that was unwanted when he was born by his mother's owner, Terrance Muncy Hatchett, who is dog breeder and treats his dogs horribly. A young boy, Colby, and his mother live with Hatchett, which he verbally abuses both of them. Colby sneaks the dog out of the house, where the dog stays at the boy's fort in the wood. Eventually, the dog grows up and can escape from the fort. He befriends a long tongue dog, who helps him on the quest to save his mother from the terrible dog breeder.

The original Benji was made seven years before I was born, but I have fond memories of watching the movies on broadcast television on Sunday afternoons. I don't ever recall seeing Benji's Very Own Christmas Story, which is only 26 minutes in length. Though Benji doesn't have anything much to do in the special, I still thought it was cute. Both Benji and For the Love of Benji are just as good as I remember, but the 70's music is a little stale. I don't know why I have never heard of Benji Off the Leash! that was released nine years ago. I was never aware there was a new movie. It's actually well-made for a low-budget film and has some decent acting. It does have a few heartbreaking scenes, but it has a happy ending. Overall, I loved watching the 2-disc set, but I do wish OH! Heavenly Dog and Benji the Hunted was on it, so it could make the Benji film collection complete.

Benji himself is from that show as well. And to think dreamy Peter Breck, Nick Barkley from The Big Valley, played the father of two children who wanted to keep Benji but whose father said no. Two adorable children had been feeding Benji under the table with the help of the housekeeper splendidly played by Patsy Garretty. Enter a pampered pooch, a lovely Maltese the housekeeper named Tiffany, and you have romance in the air. My trouble was the movie was geared toward a younger crowd so at times it was a pit silly, but the acting both of humans and canines was top-notch. Oh, and there was a neighborhood cat who was chased up a tree by Benji, much to her owner's indignation. But when the dog turned up missing, she was upset her pussy was being ignored. There is a group of kids whose need for money leads to a kidnapping of the two children and their rescue by Benji.

Benji is a fine example of his breed: they are real characters!

(a) They arrived 2 days late
(b) They didn't come with a plush ""Benji"" toy, which didn't matter to me, because I already had a plush dog which I called ""Benji"", but having one included would have been good for children, so if you order this DVD, order ""Gund Karina"" dog as well (he looks like Benji)",1349222400,,812,3.9877300613496933
1413310,4,B00005A8S3,"I remember watching this movie in theater. This was a great family friendly movie, written at a time when filmmakers and script writers knew how to produce a story that did not involve extreme violence, gutteral language, or sex. This is how movies might still be produced today if not for the big companies getting greedy and not wanting to pay script authors what they're fully worth.

My only main, and major gripe with this release, is it's not the theatrical release. It's the one that was cropped down to pan and scan 4:3 aspect ratio for old school television. It would have been awesome to have been able to enjoy the actual theatrical aspect ratio this great movie was shot it. There are so many wonderful reactive details that were happening near the edges of the frame that we're being deprived of in this 4:3 version. That's the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.

The music is to die for! Very moving, and well scored with multiple genres to please a wide audience.

The story script is just so much fun. Captivating, tear-jerking at times, even a tad frightning to the point of puttig you on the edge of your seat, yet there's nothing that would gross anyone out, nothing that would disturb or upset anyone. It's fun, and family friendly, and I'd really love to see a return to this kind of story telling. It's long past time for a return to quality entertainment of this type.

Worse, however, is the fact that this is a total rip-off bordering on outright fraud. The feature film is presented not in 1080p or 1080i high-definition, but in 720p STANDARD DEFINITION. You might just as well buy the DVD; the picture quality essentially will be the same. Technically the movie has been burned onto a Blu-ray disc, but how can GAIAM (and let me state the distributor's name once again: GAIAM) get away with calling this a proper Blu-ray when it most definitely is NOT.

Add in the fact that an ""off the shelf"" print was used, it's in the specious 1.33:1 format and has absolutely zero extras and this makes for the most condescending throw-away effort I've yet come across. Certainly not worth the $11.99 I paid for it, or even half of that. But, hey, it was for nostalgia's sake and for my young kids' enjoyment, so what the hey--it's ""only"" $11.99.

1413316,4,B00005A8S3,"Received this on Blu Ray today. Benji was a giant part of my childhood. I LOVED this dog and wanted him to be mine. The most expressive face on an animal EVER!

I got so excited when I found out it was coming to blu ray, and immediately pre-ordered it in the hopes that Amazon was wrong about the full frame listing for the picture. I had read on IMDB that it was originally 1:85, so I was sooooo hoping for a widescreen picture...and hopefully some extras (at least a trailer!).

Well, it didn't happen. This blu ray is in fact 1:33 full frame, and there is not one single extra. NOTHING.  :(

I don't know if the movie was filmed full frame or not, but I can't imagine that it was in theaters as a complete square in 1974, but I may be wrong. I will say that it looks and sounds much better than it has on any format I've ever owned of it. I don't remember what it looked like in theaters, as I was 6 years old then...LOL.

I don't know that I can recommend an upgrade from DVD, as there are zero extras. If you can find it cheap enough, I guess it's worth it for the sound and picture quality...but I wouldn't recommend paying over 10 bucks for it. I gave it 4 stars for the movie, not the disc.

I still want that dog, though.  :)",1330992000,,1234,4.053497942386831

take cue from his trainer.

After 33 years, the movie has not lose its beauty
and as if Benji and Frank Lane, his trainer, are
still with us.",1318723200,,351,4.2388059701492535
1413318,5,B00005A8S3,"Awww, what can i say about Benji? This little dog will melt your heart! This was one of my favorite childhood movies (here i go on my dog movies again) and am now proud to own it on DVD. We rented it many times as kids, but it was older and hard to find on VHS. So glad Goodtimes has released it to DVD.

If you haven't see it yet, this is a must see to add to your family movie list. While it obviously takes place in the 70's, it also meshes a small town feel of various styles and influences making an exact time period hard to pinpoint (a quality which i love about movies that gives them a timelessness.) Tho not specifically stated, with the kids relatively thick southern accents, among other things, it appears to take place in Texas. The movie was actually filmed in various locations in Texas. Both kids were in real life (surprise) actually from Texas.

Adorable kids Paul and Cindy Chapman, of a widowed and doctor father, find love and support in kind housekeeper Mary and dog Benji. Benji finds plenty of adventures of his own with the lovable locals around a small town, and a girlfriend, a little toy dog whom he ends up protecting with his life.

Meanwhile, a group of petty criminals, 3 guys and a gal, find a hideout in an old, abandoned house on the outskirts of town that's supposedly haunted. Becoming aware that Dr. Chapman's into ""money"", the group kidnap the two kids for a ransom. Can Benji save the day while protecting his girlfriend AND his two young masters?

Look for a line up of much loved familiar faces with Frances Bavier  as the ""cat lady"" (Aunt Bee from Andy Griffith) Edgar Buchanan as the local diner owner (Uncle Joe from Petticoat Junction and Green Acres), Tom Lester as the unwilling member of the criminal crew (Eb from Green Acres and Uncle Jake from ""Gordy""), Deborah Walley as the criminal girlfriend, (Julia ""Pink of Perfection"" Carey from Summer Magic) and Herb Vigran as Lt. Samuels (with a mile long list of TV credits including the ""Oh, Please Mr."" man on the Brady Bunch episode where the kids collect trading stamps as well as I Love Lucy apperances.)

The musical theme ""I Feel Love"" is sung by country music star Charlie Rich. A streetwise, bluesy theme is presented for Benji's adventures around town.

I especially liked Patsy Garret's role as the motherly Mary, she does an excellent job and her performance is genuine. I can tell she'd be just as nice in real life as her portrayal of Mary.

This is just a timeless movies that needs to be shared by young and old alike!! 5 Stars!!!",1302912000,,2543,4.5010845986984815
1413319,2,B00005A8S3,"""The most entertaining family film or our time. Maybe of all time.""  So said Cosmopolitain magazine, and a number or Amazon reviewers, including one who made this film out to be Oscar worthy.  A true masterpiece ?  I'm sorry, people, but you are nuts. And no, I'm not going to criticize it for the production values - that would be too easy.  A good film can survive a low budget.  This is just not a good film.

Yes, the dog is amazing.  Smarter than any dog I've ever seen, for sure.  And cute.  But that's it.  Most of the movie consists of Benji running around.  The music is straight from seventies porn.  The acting is atrocious.  There is a scene where a little dog gets kicked so hard we are led to believe it is dead.  And Benji keeps flashing back to this scene and other violent scenes.  The kids are kidnapped and gagged, and it's not funny like in No Deposit No Return, it's just creepy.  Of course in the end everything turns out fine, like you knew it would.  Although I heard the dog was depressed and wouldn't eat for weeks after seeing the opening night show at Grumman's.

The only reason I give it two stars is for the dog - if you could mute out all the talking and just watch the dog, it might be ok for about a 30 minute edited version.  Just goes to show what passed for film in the early seventies.

As for the reviewers who mentioned Christopher Walken and John Mellencamp - you did not see the same movie we are discussing (Benji).

Recommended only for people who are really into little dogs and could watch them for hours.  For a truly great family film, stick with Sound of Music or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.",1266883200,,1637,4.298360655737705

1413323,4,B00005A8S3,"BENJI is one of the finest films made about the trials and errors of society, as seen through the eyes of a cute male canine. This pooch wants nothing more than friendship and understanding from his daily interactions with the human species. He befriends a pair of siblings and their housekeeper who call him Benji and treat him as a respected family member.

Through the course of the film, we are given a dramatic presentation of canine emotions and perceptions, showing how closely a dog's world resembles our own. Benji develops a romantic interest as well. He is undoubtedly the hero of this story, as he courageously comes to the rescue of his human friends after they are kidnapped. There are some intense moments in the film dealing with the horrors of abduction, but through it all, Benji comes out the winner and is given his due recognition.

This film is highly recommended for family viewing. Both old and young will probably find it a worthwhile lesson of life and its challenges through the eyes of ""man's best friend"".",1171411200,,1034,4.770949720670391

1413325,5,B00005A8S3,I purchased this DVD for my neice. She thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a wholesome story that I feel kids and parents will approve.,1167868800,,127,4.565217391304348
1413326,5,B00005A8S3,"As a kid, I always thought of Benji as a cool dog who got along with everyone and was very playful.  Now as a young adult with a much matured mind, I view the canine from the other side of the picket fence with the hole...

From a professional film making standpoint, I admit the movie is subpar in terms of acting and casting.  Throughout much of the film, there are stagnant pauses in speech which, understandably, turns away many a viewer.  I know I felt the same way when I saw ""Sixth Sense"" for the first time.  However, the soundtrack, comprised mainly of one song, Charlie Rich's theme ""I Feel Love,"" is a phenomenal addendum to Benji's personality and despite the fact it is played on numerous occasions throughout the film, it is done in different ways every time.  Different tone, tempo, and emotion are used in such a way that you actually feel what Benji is thinking.  Who needs words when the music can tell the story by itself?

That being said, aside from Terminator 2: Judgement Day, no other film has made me cry as much as this one.  About 3/4 through the film at the climax, the camerawork and cinemagic, as I like to call it, force me to fight back the tears (and fail miserably everytime).  It is then that I remember why I fell in love with the movie and with dogs.  They can feel human emotions and connect with them in a way no other animal can.  They are not corruptable like human beings.  They are loyal and loving to the bitter end.  Watch this movie with an open mind and I guarantee you will be fighting back tears as well.",1143417600,,1553,4.347222222222222
1413327,5,B00005A8S3,"I grew up watching this movie. And as long as I can remember, it has given me such a comfort throughout my trials medically and emotionally as a child. Although some of the content may ""scare"" young children, it had more of a positive effect on me. All kids are different so I would reccomend that the parent or guardian watch the movie first before you let your child.

Anyway, watch the movie with an open mind and let you decide yourself if it's worth seeing again. :)",1117324800,,471,4.3522727272727275
1413328,5,B00005A8S3,"I watched this film last night for the first time since I was a child. Move over, CITIZEN KANE--this film should be number one on AFI's Greatest Films of All Time List! I bawled when little independent Benji was trying to communicate with the police that he knew where the kidnapped children were being held hostage. He worked his furry butt off trying to rescue them!

Especially moving is the scene in which Benji finally figures out how to get the attention of the police and family and makes a mad dash over there. All the while, these flashbacks and connections loop through his canine brain: the bound children, his lady dog friend being kicked by one of the sinister kidnappers, the menace of handguns, etc. This is where I just couldn't stop crying. This movie is more than just a cute kids' film--it's a paean to the loyalty and love of dogs everywhere!

ROCK ON, BENJI!

P.S. Includes an Oscar -worthy performance from Frances Bavier of Aunt Bee (THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW) fame",1109548800,,985,4.649425287356322
1413329,5,B00005A8S3,Ive been a major fan of Benji when i was a child growing up in the 80's and i was so into this movie that it was the only movie i always wanted to watch. this movie is PERFECT for boys and guys cause its a dog movie  and its also perfect for kids to enjoy because its a movie thats seen from a animals point of view. Benji is THE most popular dog in the ENTIRE wold. He outstrips Lassie and Rin Tin Tin even Beethoven. Id totally recomend that EVERYONE buy this DVD and any other Benji movie for each one is filled with memorable and enjoyable scenes. youll fall madly in love with this dog ^_^,1105660800,,594,3.991596638655462

The kidnappers are shown with handguns, and it appears the kidnapper kicks a small dog.

Benji and his girlfriend, Tiffany, are extremely well trained dogs.  But the story may be too much for some small children.

The only reason I watched this movie all the way through was because my friend wanted to watch it.  Hopefully, the new Benji movie will be way better than this movie was!  Not that I plan to see it.",1099440000,,466,4.076923076923077
1413332,4,B00005A8S3,"Joe Camp's ""Benji"" (1974) is a classic in the truest sense of the word.  Starring one of the most incredibly expressive canine actors of all time, ""Benji"" is a wonderful family film for kids (and adults) of all ages.  In fact, it is hard to imagine anyone not liking this timeless film.

The Benji of the title is a stray dog who has seemingly been adopted by everyone in the small town in which he resides.  In the extended opening sequence, Benji makes his morning rounds, where he greets all his human friends, each of whom have a different name for him.  But it is obvious his heart belongs to the Chapman children, Paul and Cindy (Allen Fiuzat and Cynthia Smith), and their housekeeper Mary (Patsy Garrett).  Unfortunately, their father, Dr. Chapman (Peter Breck), won't allow them to keep him.  Still, Benji has a full and carefree life with all his friends, and even takes care of and romances a lost female pooch he finds one day.  Then things take a turn for the worse when kidnappers show up in the old, abandoned house he calls home.  And who should they have kidnapped, but Benji's beloved Paul and Cindy, and it's not long before Benji realizes it's up to him to save the day.

What makes ""Benji"" work so well is that the dog who plays Benji (Higgins) is so expressive he is seemingly able to convey thought, so there is no need for any corny voice over work for the audience to understand exactly what Benji is up to at any time during the movie.  Also, Camp films the vast majority of the film from Benji's viewpoint, so the audience actually sees and understands everything as Benji would.  It doesn't hurt that the darned dog is so adorable and easy to root for.  He is given able support by his human costars, whose performances are uneven but perfectly suitable for the proceedings.

But then again, it's useless to even discuss performance or production values in a film like this.  The important thing is will it entertain children and the answer is a resounding ""yes!""  Better yet, unlike much of the dreck that passes as children's fare these days (with the exception of the ""Shrek"" films and the Pixar stuff) adults will be as entertained as their children.  And even though things take a sinister turn and one of the kidnappers is a sadistic, dog-kicking creep, there is nothing here that is unsuitable for even the youngest child, and parents can rest assured that everything ends happily.

If ever a film deserved a possessive credit, then it's Joe Camp's ""Benji,"" since Camp wrote, produced, directed and practically released it on his own since in 1974 no studio in Hollywood would release it.  Therefore, Camp deserves all the credit for creating one of the best family films of the past thirty years, with an invaluable assist by Higgins' trainer, the remarkable Frank Inn.  Both men became minor celebrities after the release of ""Benji,"" and followed it up with a less successful, but still entertaining, sequel named ""For the Love of Benji"" that takes place in Greece.  And ""Benji"" even can be called an ""Academy Award Nominee"" in that it's bouncy theme song, ""I Feel Love"", sung by Charlie Rich, was nominated for a Best Song Oscar.

In all, you cannot go wrong with ""Benji.""  It appears to have been re-released on DVD thanks to the new ""Benji"" movie that opened a couple of weeks ago.  This is good news since it is very hard to find, so snatch it up while you have a chance.  Even though there are no extras and only fullscreen versions available (why oh why?), its picture and sound quality are stellar and it ranks as a good buy regardless.  Your kids will love you for it. **** (out of *****)",1094342400,,3632,4.600931677018633
1413333,5,B00005A8S3,"After such a long time looking for this DVD, I finally got one. I immediately watched the movie and really enjoyed it. The quality of picture and sound are great, although there is no extra.
This year will be the 30th anniversary of its release. I think there should be 30th Anniversary Edition DVD with addition of extras as well as the release of other Benji's movies on DVD.
I hope that there will be (big) film studio such Disney does this job. And importantly, I look forward to the release of Benji's new adventure this summer!!!",1077148800,,535,4.525773195876289
1413334,5,B00005A8S3,"I have wanted to review this 1973 family classic for a very long time now, but it has been extraordinarily difficult to review something and someone who was a truly vital part of my childhood.  Some of my earliest memories are of this loveable little dog.  When the 25th anniversary edition of the film came out in 1998, I finally had the chance to reacquaint myself with my dear old friend, and it was a truly moving experience.  All these years later, Benji remains the ultimate family movie experience.  It can be quite a sad and touching experience, as well, and my emotional attachment to it has kept me from reviewing it for far too long already.  The children (and adults) of every generation need to be acquainted with this film; Benji is the great American dog who has rightly been called America's Most Huggable Hero.  I absolutely treasure this film from my childhood, and I want all children to feel the love this movie expresses and epitomizes.
The story of this movie is almost as extraordinary as the film itself.  Everybody laughed at Joe Camp when he described the movie he wanted to make.  This man who had never even made a movie or worked with animals before was committed to writing, producing, and directing a film told from the viewpoint of a dog.  There would be no dubbed voices telling the audience what the dog was thinking; the dog himself would communicate his feelings through his demeanor and facial expressions.  Even Frank Inn, Benji's owner, thought the idea was crazy when Camp came to him looking for a dog who could act.  It just so happened, though, that Camp spotted Benji and immediately knew he had found his star.  Benji was already an older dog who had retired from a distinguished seven-year career on the television show Petticoat Junction.  Frank Inn, the man who had rescued Benji from the pound many years earlier, didn't know it, but Benji's greatest performance was yet to come.
In a way, the story of the movie is rather simple.  Benji is a stray who is loved by folks all over the neighborhood, yet the place he calls home is a lonely, abandoned house.  Every day, he follows the same routine: he first heads to the Chapman house to be fed and loved by young Cindy and Paul (whose father will not allow them to keep a stray dog), then he is off to chase a neighboring cat (whose owner is played by Frances ""Aunt Bee"" Bavier), wake up old Bill (Petticoat Junction buddy Edgar Buchanan) at the caf, entertain a police officer, and rummage for food in the park.  One special day, Benji meets a cute little white dog in the park, and the two of them become inseparable.  Then disaster strikes; Benji's home is invaded by strangers who kidnap Cindy and Paul and hold them hostage there.  Benji goes all over town trying to tell his human friends where the children are, but no one will listen to him.  If he is to save the children he loves as well as his new friend Tiffany, he is going to have to come up with a way to make the humans understand him.
The last twenty minutes of this film are among the most powerful cinematic moments I have ever witnessed.  Benji turns in one of the greatest performances of all time.  Laugh if you will, but I consider Benji's performance one of the ten greatest performances of all time - that includes human as well as animal actors.  Two scenes in particular reveal the depth of Benji's acting skills.  I cannot describe what happens here without giving away important plot details, but it sends tears pouring down my cheeks no matter how many times I watch it.  You can literally read Benji's thought process and intense emotions on his face.  While it may not be manly to admit, I actually sob during these climactic scenes.  To be honest, I cry many times throughout this movie.  I am one of those people who love animals more than people, really, and I can't stand to see an animal sad or hurt.  Benji's loneliness at the beginning of the movie touches me deeply, and his joyful relationship with his new little friend Tiffany moves me beyond words.  The later scenes, though, include one traumatic moment that almost breaks my heart when it happens.
Obviously, I could sing praises to Benji all day.  This is one of the greatest movies of all time; there really is no other movie like it.  Joe Camp succeeded fabulously in telling this story from Benji's point of view.  Even the most minor human characters express feelings that go far beyond mere words, and the music, while certainly evocative of the early 1970s era, complements and intensifies every scene perfectly.  (The theme song I Feel the Love, sung by Charlie Rich, won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for an Academy Award.)  In closing, I must mention the fact that Benji was as much a hero in real life as he was in this feature film.  This vintage American ""mutt"" whom Frank Inn rescued from an animal shelter as a puppy really left an impressive mark on this world.  He and owner Frank Inn literally toured the world, bringing joy to untold numbers of children.  More importantly, he indirectly saved the lives of thousands of dogs waiting and hoping to be adopted from animal shelters.  I love Benji as if he were my very own dog; he was a ray of sunlight in my childhood and he remains a true hero to me still.  I dearly hope that today's children can get to know and love this dog and this movie as much as I do.",1073088000,,5380,4.524301964839711

He's even better than he was as Nick Barkley in the Big Valley.  I wonder why he never won the oscar for that role?  John Mellancamp really outdid himself when he directed this one.  He's an even better directer than he is a singer.  Lasse even makes a little cameo appearance in it that's bound to please the little ones.

It is romantic, heart-warmming and truthful to the fact that Benji is a film that treats the veiwer as an intellagent person. Benji does eveything that any dog can and makes you feel with him. I have bought both 'Benji' and 'For the love of Benji' Both great films and the DVD quality is great and on a future note their making another Benji film for a 2002 release titled 'Benji the rescue'",987206400,,713,4.288888888888889

The x-mas special isn't that great, but original Benji and Benji in greece are solid examples of how to do a dog of a movie.",1524441600,,149,4.0

7935183,5,B00005A8S3,"I sometimes hate how they mix reviews since this new remastered version is so much better that the previous bluray! I got the remastered Benji a few days ago and I've watched it once myself and once with my kids. It's a great restoration! In fact, it's the first them I've seen the movie widescreen! It looks wonderful for it's age, and it sounds very good. It's tons better than the previous bluray release! If you want Benji, get the orange cover with the circle that says it is widescreen!

I want to spend most of my time reviewing this new restored release, but the movie itself is very good for family entertainment. It's a fun, classic movie following a dog's life. A large part of it just follows the dog as he does his daily rounds and how he finds a lady friend and then it leads to him eventually saving the day! It's pretty slow by today's standards and younger kids will probably enjoy it more. It's pretty clean with no bad language and light violence. There is one point where a dog is kicked, but it cuts away right before the actual kick and the dog is ok later. Two kids are kidnapped and yelled at some, but they aren't hurt. The bad guys use guns to threaten and the cops use guns to arrest the bad guys. A gun being shot is show in a flashback, but nobody is shown shot. It's a very clean movie that's great for family entertainment.

It's obvious this is a movie from the 70's, but it's the best I've ever seen it. There is some grain throughout. I wouldn't call it light grain and I wouldn't call it medium grain--somewhere between the two. There's a speck of film damage here and there but you really have to be watching for it to notice. It looks really great. It was a budget release at the time and you can tell the cameras/camera work are less than amazing, but for what it is it looks great.

The sound is nothing amazing, but it lets you hear what people are saying and the music sounds pretty good. All the music is 100% 70's so if you like that style, you'll like the soundtrack.

But overall, it kept the interest of my 3 girls (ages 3-8). Some of it was a little drawn out and repetitive, but the story changes a little each repetition. I think it has a very good lesson about not giving up when you're doing the right thing. It's cute, it's simple, it's good for all ages. We're not going to watch it every week, but I'm glad we've got it and I'll pull it out again on a rainy day this summer! :) I do suggest it. I see that the ""For the Love of Benji"" restoration is coming out in April 2018, so I'll be picking that one up next.",1518912000,,2565,4.2073170731707314
