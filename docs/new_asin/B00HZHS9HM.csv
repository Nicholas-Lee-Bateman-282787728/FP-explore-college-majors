6244190,3,B00HZHS9HM,"Especially for fans of ""Romeo and Juliet"" this film has much to offer. The changes in the story are interesting. Much of the acting is good, especially from the lovers. It is a spectacular film to watch. The biggest disappointment is the songs. They are not particularly exciting to hear or see. When the songs are dull in a Bollywood film, the film really suffers.",1399161600,3,365,4.630769230769231
6244191,1,B00HZHS9HM,What a boring and pathetic movie. Deepika Paduke is a great actress and I am sorry to see she wasted her talent in this film. I did not care for the leading actor. I think they could have chosen someone better looking and less of a show off. The ending was the worst part. I could not wait for the movie to be over. It took everything I had not to walk out of it. But I figured I paid so I may as well finish it.  I don't care to see this movie again.,1398729600,4,451,3.7473684210526317
6244192,5,B00HZHS9HM,Fantastic film.  Sanjay Leela Bhansali is one my favorites directors.  Ranveer & Deepika are at their best.  This film deserve many Oscars.,1396137600,,139,5.2272727272727275
6244193,5,B00HZHS9HM,Ram-Leela is an action pack movie. Once went played in a home theater system with DTS 7.1 the sound system is very clear.,1395360000,,121,4.304347826086956

The film is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in violent times.  The eponymous lead roles are played by Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, and the supporting roles are played by an ensemble cast including Supriya Pathak Kapur, Richa Chadda, Sharad Kelkar, Gulshan Devaiah, Barkha Bisht Sengupta, and Abhimanyu Singh. The film also features a special appearance by Priyanka Chopra in the song ""Ram Chahe Leela"". The film's release, scheduled on 15 November 2013, had been stayed by Delhi High Court. The film was initially titled Ram-Leela but was changed to Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela in response to an order by the Delhi High Court and released as scheduled.

The movie which premiered on the scheduled date, opened to critical acclaim and strong box-office collections worldwide. It ultimately earned 2.02 billion (US $30 million). The film became the fifth highest grossing film of 2013 and won three Filmfare Awards from a total of eight nominations.",1467590400,4,1154,5.295081967213115
6244195,1,B00HZHS9HM,"Sad because Sanjay Leela Bhansali has been my fav. director, and he even writes movies for his wonderous movies; his sets, costumes, ambience, sensibilities in movie making put him in a catagory all by himself. That said, even with Ranveer and Deepika, even with all that I listed about about his movies being included in this one. it was just too violent for me. (His latest movie, Bajirao Mastani, also had some that I had to look away from, but it was in a historical context). In Ram-leela, it wasn't so much that a clash of the 'romeo and juliet' story families would have some fights, what disturbed me was that he and she seemed to have violence and threat of violent as part of their love scenes and love story, she with a big knife, this kind of weird play on both sides between them, and just insanely violent ways and thinking of at least one side of the family, can't remember. Just was awful to watch, way over the top like insanity type violence in my view. I had bought the movie and found it so distasteful that I actually sent it to the dump. That's my review.",1465603200,,1077,4.39
6244196,5,B00HZHS9HM,"This will stand as an enduring classic for it's beautiful production with excellent ensemble work.  You may know the ending, but the passion is fresh!

6244199,5,B00HZHS9HM,Love this movie! So much better then the bland Romero and Juliet movies out there. Their take on Shakespeare's tragic love story is colorful and beautifully made. Any first time Bollywood movie watchers out there should watch this.,1421107200,2,231,5.105263157894737

Because the video for ""Tattad Tattad"" is ridiculously watchable, for both Ranveer and the amazing staging of the dance number.",1520726400,2,345,4.948275862068965
