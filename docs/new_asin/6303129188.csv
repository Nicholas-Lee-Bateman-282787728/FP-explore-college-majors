567630,4,6303129188,"the monster and the girl is a very strange but

good movie from the classic monster era. univeral

released but it was made by paramount. it has the

same elements of the universal classic monsters but

added film noir type film with gangsters and it's

actually a very good movie. the title makes it seems

more hokey than it is. the story and acting are quite

good and you have george zucco in it as the mad doctor!

i was suprised and it's one of my favorite of the genre.

if you liked murder at the zoo or film noir movies you'll

love this one too! very well made and entertaining.",1172448000,6,588,4.216216216216216

Film starts as melodrama with a girl getting involved with a white slavery ring then veers into horror when her avenging brother has his brain transplanted into a gorilla who then goes after the villains.

567700,5,6303129188,"The plot of the movie is well described by other reviewers, but surprisingly you might find yourself feeling sympathetic for the gorilla and the girl. Not so surprising to me was that the dog who somehow telepathically knows who the gorilla really is, steals your heart. Absolutely an excellent movie, well worth the price, and worth watching again from time to time.",1411776000,5,367,4.935483870967742

""The Monster and the Girl""is the first one I've purchased that will not playback on any of 3 dvd players or my blu-ray player into which I loaded it. This is not a bad review of the movie, but the defective pressing of this title, as I see one other customer review that confirms the same problem.",1406246400,5,370,4.3768115942028984

567706,4,6303129188,"This is the release I've been waiting for.  This film is, at best, second tier.  Yet I liked the story of a man who wreaks vengeance after he's been executed for a murder he never committed and his brain is transplanted after his execution into the body of a gorilla.  The premise is silly, but, for me, affecting, and the acting surprisingly good.  Call it a guilty pleasure.",1377129600,6,376,4.485294117647059
567707,1,6303129188,"This is a fun Paramount horror film that has been on my ""I hope it comes out on DVD"" list for years.  The movie is enjoyable, but don't expect it to be as good as a classic like DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN.  If you enjoy films like THE BRUTE MAN or CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN, you will enjoy THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL.  So why only one star?  The DVD has audio drop outs starting at 8 minutes into the film.  Universal and Amazon are aware of the issue, but the problem has still not been fixed.  It starts in the beginning courtroom scene where the prosecutor is saying the word ""fingerprints"" but you only get to hear ""finger...""  It continues from there with frequent audio dropouts.  It is a problem wit the DVD because the old VHS tape does not have these flaws.  If you must have the film on DVD, then buy it, but beware that the static dialogue is annoying!",1359072000,8,851,4.236024844720497
567708,5,6303129188,"Monster And The Girl is a B movie with A production values.
Direction,photography and production design are all first rate;the film looks
stunning. This is a most interesting hybrid of Noir and Horror genres and played
totally straight by a great cast.

Although originally a Paramount film this Universal Vault DVD is beautifully presented
and film has a strange dream (nightmare?) like quality  throughout.

This is everything a B movie should be and gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.",1352937600,4,484,5.259740259740259
567709,4,6303129188,"One can only admire the sheer imaginative virtuosity of various horror units of the 1930s and 1940s, which managed to turn out so many variations on the same story. Stuart Heisler's film, one of Paramount's answers to the Universal cycle of films appearing about the same time, stars Ellen Drew, a lesser-known leading player of the period, who has a nuanced role as a young woman encountering a monster. The plot is familiar, but the film is distinguished by her performance. Worth a look.",1345852800,2,490,4.845238095238095

The main storyline is a guy is sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. A doctor visits him in death row and asks for the use of his brain after he dies. The mans brain goes into the body of a gorilla. The gorilla with the mans brain inside of it goes on a revenge killing spree for the people who framed and save his sister and that boys and girls is your movie in a nutshell. The movie sort of reminds me your cheesy seventies movies short on plot, action and budget. The Monster and the Girl gets a C+.",1490400000,,619,4.0

7838474,4,6303129188,"THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL is a story told in flashback during a murder trial. A pair of newlyweds, named Susan and Larry (Ellen Drew and Robert Paige), embark on their new life together, only to get mixed up w/ a group of odious gangsters. After much degrading criminal activity, Susan's brother, Scot,  is convicted of murdering one of the bad guys. He swears vengeance. As luck would have it, while in his prison cell, Scot is visited by Dr. Parry (George Zucco- VOODOO MAN, FOG ISLAND, THE FLYING SERPENT), who just happens to need a human brain for his experiments. In no time at all, Scot is whisked off to Parry's secret lab, where his brain is plopped into a go-rilla's body! As it turns out, this serves Scot's plans perfectly, resulting in Several fuzzy, gangland homicides. The victims are found crushed, as if by super-human strength! The police are stumped, unable to make the Scot / go-rilla connection. This is one of the more interesting ""ape-runs-amok"" movies of its time. An example of an absurd idea, executed brilliantly. The scene where go-rilla-Scot returns home, and encounters his dog, is very effective. Co-stars Gerald Mohr (MY WORLD DIES SCREAMING aka: TERROR IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE, ANGRY RED PLANET) as the eeevil Munn. Highly entertaining...",1450483200,2,1267,4.8930232558139535

7838478,4,6303129188,A strange movie. In this one an innocent man is executed for one heck of a good frame-up. Once he's dead a scientist places his brain into the body of a gorilla. The now-monster of this film makes it his mission to eliminate each of the people who helped frame him and take advantage of his sister (the girl of the title). A surprisingly good movie for its genre and time.,1411862400,2,372,4.253521126760563
