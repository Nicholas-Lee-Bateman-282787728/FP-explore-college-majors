2676110,5,B000JLTRMM,"My grand daughter loves Blue's Room DVDs.  It's great being able to buy two or three used DVDs for the price of one new one on your site.  Your pricing and selections are great and your service is the best, I've never been disappointed buying from Amazon.",1214438400,,255,4.404255319148936
2676111,5,B000JLTRMM,"My 2 yr old son still liks Blues Clues better, but he loves his Blues Room too! Its a very good dvd 2 full blues room episodes and 2 Blues clues episodes too plus little extras. It really does help kids learn by having fun! Some people complain about Blue's ""voice"" but it is phonetically correct and she talks with pauses and heavy pronounciation, which in turn has been proven in studies to help them learn words better, because she isn't talking as fast as the other characters, so then the attention is diverted to Blue. Pretty smart if you ask me.
I enjoy Blues Room too, its better than some of these nonsense shows out there.",1185408000,,632,4.410256410256411

2676113,5,B000JLTRMM,"""Blue's Room: Knights of The Snack Table"" is the first-ever DVD release featuring the all-new ""Blue's Room"" with Sprinkles and Joe on-board as regular characters. It contains two episodes of it, as well as two episodes of ""Blue's Clues.""

The flagship episode, ""Knights of the Snack Table,"" is a DVD-premiere and as of the writing of this review, has not been seen seen on Nick Jr. Blue and her little brother Sprinkles are playing knights. Joe is a king and he's lost his four dragons. He needs Blue, Sprinkles and our help to find them. He presents us with a shield (which can be seen on the DVD cover art) containing the four dragons. Along the way, we play various games and learn many things to help Joe find his dragons. The other ""Blue's Room"" episode is the premiere of the new episodes, ""Blue's Farm Play Date."" Joe is Farmer Joe MacDonald this time and he needs help taking care of animals. This episode teaches types of animals, counting, and more.

If you or your kids don't like ""Blue's Room"" (even with the wonderful additions of Joe and Sprinkles), there are also two ""Blue's Clues"" episodes to be found on this DVD. Both of them feature Joe. The first is ""The Boat Float,"" in which the characters create their own boats to sail. Viewers learn about what causes boats to sink and how to keep them floating, as well as how different types of boats move. The other episode is ""The Scavenger Hunt."" Blue and Magenta put together a scavenger hunt. As we help Joe find items that are on the scavenger hunt list, they ultimately come together to create clues.

This DVD includes a special bonus --- a sneak-peek at the ""Save the Blowfish! episode from the first-ever ""Wonder Pets!"" DVD coming in April. It's a nice sneak-peek that will please fans of this wonderful new addition to Nick Jr.'s lineup.",1172966400,15,1809,4.611801242236025
