8137983,5,B000HBL47K,The word that best describes James Spader is enigmatic.  On shows with an audience he certainly doesn't short-change anyone but there's always the feeling that he only lets you see what he wants you to see.  This interview - one to one - was different.  Charlie Rose let Spader talk without those  intrusive and even impertinent questions that are the stock-in-trade of so many other hosts.  I found this DVD riveting and Spader seeemed relaxed and at ease.  I've wanted to see the interview for a long time and it was certainly well worth waiting for.,1207958400,5,552,4.697916666666667
