8135984,3,B0007QCLMW,"Two things pushed me to watch this movie almost against my will: Is from the Caldern Stell brothers and I wanted to see if I could find all the ''vedettes'' on screen after reading their names on the credits.

From the 11 movies that Montenegro and Rivero made together, there's one where she pretends to be a man, so it was his turn now to do the opposite.
To make Rivero sign the contract someone surely told him that this would be a comedy in the style of UNA EVA Y DOS ADANES (Some like it hot), but check this out and tell me if this is a good idea:

1- With those huge muscles, Rivero has bone marrow cancer and has seen several specialists, who had told him the same, no cure.

2- His mother is catholic, so he can not commit suicide because that would kill her too, losing her son and thinking he was going to hell it was just too much.

3- He decides to hire someone to kill him by surprise, and that way he won't even feel it.

4- Just seconds after signing the contract with the assassins, arriving at home, the phone is ringing and is one of the doctors telling him they were ALL WRONG, ALL OF THEM!!! He is not going to die after all...Is that even believable?

5- He can not undo the killing thing, so gets his friend (Incln) and move to another apartment DRESSED AS WOMEN until the hired assassins forget the whole deal when they never find him.

6- A slutty neighbor sees them moving in and quickly calls Montenegro so she can hire Rivero as her personal assistant. Montenegro likes them big and manly.

7- MUECAS DE MEDIANOCHE, is the place where Montenegro performs a couple numbers. Here is where the flesh showing, the dancing and the drinking begins.

8- LA CORCHOLATA shows up, along with Isela Vega, Caballo Rojas, Andrs Garca playing himself, Manuel loco Valds (in love with Incln in drag), la creme de la creme.

9- Rivero falls in love with, wanna guess? Montenegro! (her name here is GINA MONTESCO, just like Gina Montes, the brazilian vedette, who is also there) and everything starts to get complicated when the assassin shows up as one of Montenegro's ''friend''.

10- Another asian-looking 'vedette'' is there and is not Lyn Mai, maybe she had BETTER things to do... really? In the end I didn't find all the vedettes I was looking for but found out Rivero and Incln's costume designer was MITZI! Yes, Thalas Mitzi... (I think he was jealous and that's why he made those horrible dresses) unbelievable!",1316736000,2,2432,4.467268623024831

When Jorge Rivero thinks he is dying, he and his friend (Rafael Inclan) go to a Mafia boss to take out a contract on his life so his family can collect the insurance. Later that day he finds out that the doctor made a mistake and he's not dying after all. Now he and his buddy have to disguise themselves as women to avoid being killed.  They get jobs at the local cabaret which gives them (and us) an excellent opportunity to ogle several nice looking chorus girls and others (Sasha Montenegro)walking around for several minutes wearing nothing but a pair of high heels and a smile.  In a secondary story, Andres Garcia tries a dozen different ways to get the owner of the cabaret (Isela Vega) to fall for him.

This comedy made in 1978 has a lot of funny lines as well as showing a lot of skin from many beautiful women including both lead actresses.

The DVD has no extras but the print is bright and clear and both the actors and actresses are good looking people.",1179014400,10,1013,4.367021276595745
