2925255,5,B000UUX2RS,"Another Stand up comedy that kept me rolling with laughter.  I really relate to the cultural differences in a marriage . My husband here 6 years me my entire life so these all really hit home and are very funny!  Your amazingly funny , I would hope that you can be in Arkansas at some point. Would love to see you! Keep  up the amazing work.  God Bless you  ! Jacinto y Linda Ramos",1315785600,,381,4.094594594594595
2925256,5,B000UUX2RS,"Truly funny!!! This guy has me in stiches!!! I laughed so hard beginning to end! Whether you're a Mexican hillbilly or one or the other, another minority or someone who simply appreciates culture and a good laugh then this dvd is for you! Just like his other dvd's I can watch it over and over and die laughing each time!  Let Alex help you forget about the stress of life with a good hardy belly laugh! Highly recommended",1315267200,,422,4.410256410256411
2925257,3,B000UUX2RS,"I just finished Watching this Short Comedy Act by Alex Reymundo and It had some Good Laughs but nothing that I would recomend to other Latin King Fans.  I didn't like how he did use some previous jokes from the Orginal Latin King Comedy.  Fortunatly it was only minimal and he did have some Very Orginal Jokes in Hick Spanic.  Over all, this is a Fairly Average Comedy for a Fairly average Comedian. Perhaps the Comedy will be Funnier if intoxicated. Enjoy and Laugh",1222214400,,466,4.523809523809524
2925258,4,B000UUX2RS,"Hick-Spanic this is one of his best stand-up. Alex is funnier than ever, but you must know a small amount of spanish to understand the jokes. Must see DVD, it will have you rolling on the floor.",1216598400,2,194,4.27027027027027
2925259,1,B000UUX2RS,"I would have enjoyed this a bit more if I were Hispanic. As it was, the use of the Spanish language made this movie beyond my comprehension. And I was a bit put off my the amount of sexual references.",1212969600,3,200,4.025
2925260,5,B000UUX2RS,"I have been a fan of Alex Reymundo's ever since I saw him in the Latin Kings of Comedy. He has a very unique way of pulling the audience into his own little world for one heck of a show. He can make you laugh at just about anything, from his first meeting with his in-laws, to being a latino growing up with 87 immediate and extended family members, and including a short video depicting how he came to be a comedian in the first place. I hope you enjoy the show as much as I did, it'll soon be recognized as an instant classic as his career continues to grow.",1202860800,4,560,4.054054054054054
2925261,4,B000UUX2RS,"This was pretty funny, even if you aren't hispanic. And Alex Reymundo is very talented.  Some of his material is predictable but he's got great comedic timing & his body language enhances his delivery. Show is well produced with talented musicians and pretty girls completing the package.",1200268800,3,288,5.127659574468085
8214906,5,B000UUX2RS,absolutely hilarious make you pee a little funny!!,1513123200,,50,5.375
8214907,1,B000UUX2RS,"This is crap! Poorly delivered, weak, unfunny jokes. The stupid thing takes forever to even take off.
Save your time, this totally sucks!",1505952000,,137,5.0
8214908,1,B000UUX2RS,"alex opens with filthy words then proceeds into sex, trashing females, proud to lie to women, more than half of his set is done in a foreign language, who knows, Mexican?  He was so rank that I turned him off and didn't even consider fast forwarding.  This is the kind of male human being that the world is made up of.  Low life liar, thief, deceiver and proud of it.  His vocabulary consists of all foul words, his brain lives in his smelly pants and he gets on a stage acting as though he is proud to be carving out a path to hell.  Trash act from a trashy man.  The only laughs came from his own lips.",1505606400,3,604,4.076271186440678
8214909,1,B000UUX2RS,"If you think that simply being Mexican and speaking rapid-fire Spanish is hilarious, then this guy is for you.  I waited for fifteen minutes to hear some humor, but there was none.  I found Alex to be about as funny as a dead nun.  But at least he finds time to make fun of white people.  How unique.  Not funny at all.",1503360000,3,319,4.080645161290323
8214910,5,B000UUX2RS,I had one and I got this for a gift and they loved it!,1472860800,,54,2.9285714285714284

8214913,5,B000UUX2RS,This is another dvd we watch regularly around my house funny and a little crude awesome overall,1425513600,,95,4.647058823529412
8214914,3,B000UUX2RS,ehh . . .He was ok.  I like George Lopez and thought this guy would be funny too.  I'm not sure what it is but this guy made me chuckle lightly more than LOL,1413936000,,157,3.588235294117647
8214915,5,B000UUX2RS,Very funny! I've bought every DVD I can find of Alex Reymundo.,1406851200,,62,4.25
