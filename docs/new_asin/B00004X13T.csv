1366898,3,B00004X13T,"The Skulls finds us at Yale University, which you'll have to assume on your own like I did since they never actually say Yale.  We meet Luke, who is a self-confessed former menace to society, working the cafeteria line and studying hard to make something of himself and hopefully go on to Harvard Law School.  The only thing standing in the way of that goal for this young man is the fact that Harvard Law is a teensy weensy bit expensive.
 Luke, along with best friend Will (Hill Harper) and girlfriend Chloe (Leslie Bibb) speculate on his chances to be chosen to join the Skulls, a secret society on campus which is rumored to pay for such things as law school bills.
 It is the secrecy of the society that becomes a rift between Luke and his pals.  His buddy Will speculates, ""It's secret and it's elite - it can't be good.""  Insert ominous music here.  By the stroke of midnight on that same eve, Luke finds himself in the midst of the Skulls initiation ceremony.
 The rules that govern the Skulls are grounded in loyalty to the other members, a willingness to do anything to protect the other members, and keeping the integrity of the Skulls by not divulging any of the proceedings to those on the outside.
 How can an organization that spawned no less than three U.S. Presidents be bad?  Besides, you get a kickin' new watch to cover up the Skull logo they brand into your wrist, you've got money in your bank account, they set you up with a fancy car AND even if you have a girlfriend, they've got a couple more for you.  Luke McNamara is thinking all this is too good to be true....and he's right, it is.  It is only at the time of a murder cover-up that Luke begins to realize how corrupt the Skulls are and how high their influence and power runs.
 Luke is warned by Skulls soulmate Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker) to back off and not try to dig too deep.  Caleb's got a leg-up considering his dad, Judge Litton Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) is the Chairman of the Skulls organization, not to mention, has designs on the Supreme Court.
 As you might have guessed, The Skulls follows a pretty basic formula with the suspense, the wondering who is good and who is bad.  Is an elaborate murder plot just another method to fight for control of the society?  Who's the pawn and who is the player?
 The Skulls seems like a watered down version of The Firm.  Call it the New Coke of conspiracy movies.  Almost, but not quite right.  Where The Firm made it very clear where the lines were drawn and the penalties for disloyalty were clear, with The Skulls, there doesn't appear to be anything at stake for the society.  They talk about being a member and understanding the virtues of the organization and that the laws of the Skulls are above all other laws, but it still rings hollow.  The Firm infiltrated the lives of its characters, and so does The Skulls, but it never explains why.  The conflict is room temperature at best.
 I think they were hoping for a Firm-esque thing here, one got that feeling from the previews.  I was discussing the possible plot with a friend before having seen it and he was speculating on a sequence that might go something like, ""Gee, thanks for the Porsche....what's this?  I have to drink blood?  Ew[...]""  Well, he was pretty close.
 BUT.  You had to know there was a ""but"" in here somewhere.  So help me, I was entertained.  There are days when, forgive me, I don't want to think too hard.  It's sort of comforting, sometimes, to know that a movie is going to have the appropriately shaky camera shots during the tense scenes, and the music will swell ominously at just the precise moment.
 You know yourself, and you know the movies you like.  Then there are times, hopefully, when you allow yourself to sit there and be entertained, pure and simple, without apologies.  On a different day, in another frame of mind, The Skulls might have really really irritated me.  So, I gave some, but not all of my critical self the day off in a manner of speaking.
 The acting is OK, it compliments the New Coke attitude of the script.  Joshua Jackson is likable, and Paul Walker is moderately interesting as the spoiled heir-to-the-throne Caleb.  You get to see Craig T. Nelson as a mean, creepy guy instead of the bumbling confused Coach character you see now on reruns.  The most interesting performance is that of William Petersen who plays a U.S. Senator that is in the Skulls organization.
 The camera work is predictable but still fun.  The soundtrack is pretty cool, which is sometimes the only reason movies like this aren't immediately forgotten.  However, there is nothing riveting or conflicting enough to keep you glued to your seat.
 You know what you like.  Sometimes you're in the mood for something different.  Sometimes you're in the mood for something ridiculous in the hopes of being entertained.",971222400,21,4842,4.569105691056911
1366899,4,B00004X13T,"The Skulls has just enough twist and turns to make it a fairly interesting thriller.  The basic story is about a struggling college student (Joshua Jackson) and what happens when he is invited into a secret society called The Skulls.  The character development is somewhat weak but Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Leslie Bibb and Craig T. Nelson pull off their respective roles and make this an enjoyable film.  Give this one a chance, it is worth it!!",970444800,,449,4.805194805194805
1366900,2,B00004X13T,"I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we don't even get to see as much as we'd like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a ""secret society.""  The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell. The Skulls did resemble a teenage version of The Firm, which was a way better film all together, but what can you expect from the whole set of the WB. Just kidding.",970358400,,922,4.179775280898877
1366901,2,B00004X13T,"I think that Joshua Jackson is hot (and Paul Walker is pretty cute, too), but this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  When I went to  see it, I thought that I might like it because the story about a powerful,  but dangerous, fraternity/secret society sounded interesting.  However,they  failed to make a good movie out of a good idea.  It had a poor, predictable  ending.  The last shot with the sunset was so incredibly cheesy as were a  lot of other elements in the movie.  Luke is so poor (he has no father and  his mother died when he was one...that's a little extreme...why don't they  just say that he was born in a box on the street?), but he's going to an  ivy-league school on a full scholarship because he's great at rowing, and  now he can't pay for graduate school...boo hoo...get a loan!  Things like  this as well as the OVERDONE, CHEESY CINEMATOGRAPHY made this movie really  irritating to watch.  However, if you love to stare at Joshua Jackson (and  not care what the movie is about), I suggest that you see it because he is  actually in more than two or three scenes.  I give the movie 2 stars for  two cute guys...but that's it.",969235200,4,1164,4.366197183098592
1366902,3,B00004X13T,"I don't get this movie. The story is more than predictable - and still, it is very talentlessly told! And above all, the character descriptions are  very very very poor. In brief, The Skulls has no structure at all and  leaves me wonder if the makers have cooperated at all, or if they've just  quarrelled from the very first shooting day.
The third star is for the  exciting scenes that it - after all- does provide! But in general, this is  really a waste of time.",968371200,2,466,4.372093023255814
1366903,5,B00004X13T,"Yeah, I thought this was gonna be some other dumb college drama-rama, too, but The Skulls completely took me by surprise.  Joshua Jackson gave an  AWESOME performance; the plot was untouchable; and man, did it keep you on  the edge of your seat!  It also had some luv for all you romantics out  there...come to think of it, it had a little bit of everything!  Is Caleb a  bad guy at heart?  Who's he to believe...Luke or his dad?  When is the  truth thicker than blood?  Watch this and find out....",968198400,,498,4.362637362637362
1366904,5,B00004X13T,"The Skulls is one of the finest movies in this year. The story is very  scary and the actors do their jobs fantastic. if you ever studied at a  university or college, watch this movie. skulls...above everything two  thumbs up",966470400,,225,4.575
1366905,5,B00004X13T,"This movie shows you the things that could happen in any fraternity out there in college.  They go overboard and things go awry.  It might be fun  pledging, but once you get accepted to the Skulls and find out some of the  other games that they play, you just might decide to want to get out before  you life depends on it.  Watch this movie if you haven't already, it's a  good suspense movie.",966038400,,394,4.243243243243243
1366906,5,B00004X13T,"The Skulls has everything a thriller should suspense, great dircting and good acting.  Rob Cohen(Dragonheart) has extended his ability even more in  the directing chair. he knows how to make a thriller with the right amounts  of suspense, humor, and style.  Joshuwa jackson made the right decison  coming into movies as a supporting player to help build his fan base and to  get noticed by the critics.  His first leading role is nothing but fabulos.  He shows he can go beyond being the wise cracking side kick.  paul walker  is slowly proving he can be a leading man. he plays a jock down to the tee.  Both jackson and walker have proven that they can make it in hollywood and  be more than teen stars.  Overall the skulls is an enjoyable movie that has  shown that teen movies can be more than mindless comedy.  it has extended  the genre to include a more mature audience.  this is definentyly  recommended to all age groups it can entertain them all. the skulls has it  all acting directing good plot and its just plain entertaining!",966038400,2,1038,4.604395604395604

1366908,4,B00004X13T,"I like this film overall. It is fairly well paced. The actors/actresses are good. I have 3 slight problems with the film. 1. Why does Judge Mandrake cut off so much from his cigar? Macanudos are great and expensive. 2. Why are all the Skulls right handed? When they get branded they all on the left wrist. 3. Also, why are all the female 'guests' on the island white? Why isn't there a representative group of women? Too one sided. Good film overall.",1505606400,,450,4.433734939759036

He basically has one ho-hum expression the entire time when not pretending to be mad. His meltdown scene in front of the police was cringe-worthy.

I really wouldn't call this movie a suspense because, to be completely honest... no, any kind of suspense is grossly exaggerated. It has a few suspenseful moments but for the most part, the Skulls leans towards a mystery style of storytelling above all else, and only interesting on a younger adult level at the most.

It's about a secret society who's *extremely* loyal (to the point they get permanent symbols burnt into their arms so the society can forever be identifiable). It mostly centers around two boys in particular involving a murder that eventually occurs later on. However the build up GETTING to that point is pretty brutal and unsatisfactory. The final 30 minutes is when the storyline finally improves.

I couldn't help but laugh at how difficult it is to believe that there really ARE societies like this out there amongst the college crowds (though exaggerated for the sake of telling an interesting story- at least I HOPE so).

The main reason I'm giving the Skulls a 4-point rating and not a 3 is because you really feel for the one kid innocent of the murder charges. He has absolutely no defense (or so it would seem) so what ends up happening to him makes you feel sorry for his crappy luck, and there's a distinct element of mystery and perhaps even some cleverness pertaining to *who* exactly is involved in the dreaded murder and who's running the ultra-serious society that involves such unbelievable characters as one of the members own father being in charge of the entire operation, haha.

At an Ivy League College there is a Secret Society of the best and the brightest who will act to further each other's successes in controlling the country. They discuss ""The Power Elite"" in class. There is a boat race between colleges. [Was this copied from England?] Luke gets a phone call, then another. ""Drink Me"". Men climb out of coffins. [This is not a vampire movie.] They are given a task: to steal a python. They succeed at a difficult task. Luke is now one of the chosen elite. They are branded like cattle! Later there is a fancy dress dinner. Young women are brought in for ""dancing"". The next day they are given cars. One man finds his car window broken. There is an intruder in the Skulls building. Was it made to look like an accident? There is another ritual for the members. Caleb tells the truth about what happened. ""It may not be right, but it worked."" Luke takes the deal. Luke talks to his old friends (he is a townie). He learns about the collection of tapes. His friend tells him his telephone and apartment are bugged, and so is his girlfriend. ""Nobody is safe.""

Should Lucas be placed in a hospital for psychological evaluation? There is a vote. Luke asks Chloe to play it safe. She won't. Luke follows a man into the vault to get some taped records. He is pursued and caught. Or is he? The pate shows what happened. ""They killed him."" Luke goes to the police, and learns that Caleb accused him of murder! But Luke has that tape, and they play it. It is blank! Luke becomes quite upset! ""I'm innocent."" He is taken away in an ambulance to a hospital for troubled people. Chloe pleads with Caleb, then tells him what happened after he left the building. A man attacks her, she runs away. Senator Leveret offers to help her by taking her to see Luke. She rescues Luke and puts her in a rental car. [Is this all too easy?] But a light truck starts crashing into the car until their car is forced into an obstruction! Is it all over for them? Or will they be saved by a miracle? [It has to be one or the other.]

What is the meaning of all this? ""We live by the rules and die by the rules"" is a coded message. A private meeting is interrupted. [Would Luke make a good lawyer?] Will there be a duel to resolve the differences? [The Code of the Duel says the person challenged gets to pick the weapon.] There is another dramatic surprise. Then another! ""Its over."" Will the good guys win? Will there be a happy ending"" Maybe. The loose ends are left untied. This is a good drama, like ""Blow Out"" or ""The Parallex View"", but with a happier ending. Would it be as successful if Chloe and Luke perished on the railroad tracks? Probably not.

C. Wright Mills wrote ""The Power Elite"" about 50 years ago. G. William Domhoff wrote ""Who Rules America Now"" in the 1980s. These works discuss classes and wealth in this county.

In the movie we are told that The Skulls have 322 alumni members. In the real life Skull & Bones society at Yale their symbol is of a skull, with two crossbones under it and the number 322 under that.

This movie was released on March 31, 2000. Election day was Tuesday, November 7, 2000. Yet this movie opens with the tag line that 3 USA Presidents have been bonesmen. As of March 31, 2000 only (william taft and geogre herbert walker bush) were the TWO presidents that were bonesmen. The race between Al Gore and bonesman George Bush would not be decided until 7 months later. Geroge bush would beat al gore thus making him the 3rd bonesman.

This movie also predicts 911. At the end of the movie Joshua Jackson challenges Paul Walker to a duel by invoking rule 119 of the Skull textbook. Reverse 119 and you get 911, as in September 11th 2001. A year and 5 months before the world trade center attack.

I think I was like fifteen and, while I never watched `Dawson's Creek', I was kind of intrigued by Joshua Jackson (my friends said I looked like him so for some reason I wanted to be him).  Walking away from this movie I concluded that 1) Joshua Jackson was my hero 2) Leslie Bibb was all sorts of hot and 3) Paul Walker is an atrocious actor.

Joshua Jackson isn't my hero any longer, but I still agree with points 2 & 3.

This film, upon reflection, is all sorts of ridiculous, but it never ceases to be 100% engaging and entertaining and I could sit down and watch it right now and find it just as effectively engrossing as it was ten year ago.  Sure, it is heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) flawed, but it's a lot of fun, and that amounts for a lot.

The film follows Luke, a poor kid who finds a big opportunity in when he is accepted into the life of the Skulls, a secret organization that selects a few Ivy League students to drink from their river of privilege.  Even though he is cautioned by his roommate, he accepts anyways, only to find his roommate dead.  All fingers start to point at Luke's Skull `soul mate', Caleb, but could it really be that easy?

Insert intense drama here.

The film is a little all over the place, unintentionally campy and ridiculously preposterous, but there is an earnestness that helps carry the film to the very end.  Joshua Jackson works hard to elevate the film, and he manages to do just that most of the time.  He is equal parts romantic lead, nave victim and commanding hero, and he flashes his actor card quite a bit here.  I'm actually shocked that Jackson never become a BIG star.  I mean, he really has the chops.  Sure, he has a following and has been in a few films and currently resides on television, but I really saw big (and I mean BIG) things for him.  I'm shocked that Paul Walker (who can't really act to save his life) is the one who walked away from this a star.  Even Leslie Bibb faded into obscurity, when she is nothing short of stunning here.

Thank god she resurfaced in '06 as Ricky Bobby's materialistic wife.

(USA - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

After being recruited to a secret society operating behind closed doors at his Ivy League university, a young student (Joshua Jackson) becomes suspicious of the organization's ringleaders following the unexpected 'suicide' of a close friend (Hill Harper) who had set out to expose the society's criminal methods.

The cross-pollination of film and television continues apace with this entertaining yarn, featuring a number of well-known TV faces, including Craig T. Nelson (""The District""), William L. Petersen (""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"") and Steve Harris (""The Practice"") as the token grown-ups, and Leslie Bibb (""Popular"") as Jackson's love interest. Paul Walker (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) is the golden-haired jock who seems to know more about Harper's tragic death than he's prepared to admit.

On hiatus from ""Dawson's Creek"", Jackson coasts through proceedings on the strength of his TV persona (smart, plucky and wise beyond his years), battling the age-old rituals of an ancient cabal which moulds a selection of today's student body into tomorrow's politicians and business leaders, and will stop at nothing to conceal its activities from the outside world. Murder and mayhem are the order of the day, though the movie is flawed by a couple of implausible plot twists and a rather tepid climax. Beautifully photographed by Shane Hurlbut; directed by Rob Cohen (DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY).

1366989,4,B00004X13T,"The primary purpose of The Skulls is to give viewers and inside look at the lives of the influential power brokers who rule the world clandestinely through politics, nepotism, college admission grandfather clauses, and most importantly secret societies.  Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) - roommate to snoopy school reporter Will (Hill Harper) - is one of the lucky few tapped to become a member of The Skulls, a prestigious and exclusive organization at his college.  Paired with Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), the son of the current chairman, the two go through initiation (the cookie scene is conspicuously absent) and discover the political and power struggles within the organization, and lengths to which some might go to maintain control, are potentially life threatening.

Secondary to the synopsis, however, The Skulls provides the viewer with four immutable truths.

One, Joshua Jackson will never outlive his Pacey Witter role on Dawson's Creek.  It is difficult to start your career as second fiddle to James Van Der Beek and live it down.  It's reminiscent of the old farmer story, where he does wonderful things lifelong, various philanthropic endeavors, and feels he doesn't deserve the nickname he's been given when caught one fateful night in a barn with a farm animal.  Some things can't be forgotten.

Two, it provides the first meaningful and noticeable film time for the beautiful Leslie Bibb's (Ricky Bobby's wife on Talledega Nights).  She exudes confidence, sexiness, compassion, and timing that helps a movie that is slow moving at times move along flawlessly.

Three, societies like the Skull and Bones portrayed in this movie are irritatingly secretive.  Told through the lens of a Skulls' benefits (i.e. money, women, fame, power), the insider's point of view only enhances the feeling many feel towards the members and the head start in life they are given.  On the other hand, we also see the converse of the media, who bring with them nosiness, pushiness, and sometimes illegality.  Many in the press misconstrue their rights believing how they get the story inconsequential, their scoop superseding the law.

Four, the most stone cold lock of this movie is Paul Walker's character.  He is unequivocally the best privileged, silver spoon, son of a doctor/lawyer/congressman, actor there is in Hollywood.  Nobody else since Keanu Reeves can pull off the slack-jawed, glassy-eyed, happy to be here, ""Aw Shucks"" of which Paul is capable.  It wouldn't surprise me if he were an honorary member of a secret society on looks alone.

Along with Craig T. Nelson and William Peterson, the cast is superb, especially considering how this movie was received.  All other aspects are equally enjoyable, right down to the last confrontation and application of archaic society rules.  Well thought out, clever and suspenseful at times, the production values are top notch.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than most.

It's about a secret society in an Ivy league university, where members are expected to put loyalty and service to each other above the law or any outside loyalties, secretly helping each other to advance in society with special favors.  In the old version Glenn Ford was an adult who was called upon to repay his debt to the society, at a higher cost than he ever anticipated, and it's intensely suspenseful, as he keeps trying to find a way out but learns everyone he appeals to for help is either loyal to the secret society or threatened and controlled by them.  It's a kind of paranoia suspense thriller, almost like Three Days of the Condor.

Unfortunately in this version about college kids, you just get the feeling that the protagonist can simply walk away from the whole thing - they practically tell him that he can, at one point.  And the secret society, with corny props all over, seem more like a children's club, like something Opie would join on The Andy Griffith Show, rather than the realistic and subtly ominous organization of The Bell, reminiscent of old conspiracy theories about the Masons and such.  Plus, Craig Nelson is just too much a light weight for the villain compared to Dean Jagger.  Brotherhood of the Bell had a better cast all around, with great character actors like Will Geer and William Conrad.

Once you see that, then the events of the film fall into place, since the junior players in the events are pawns of the council members who are competing for the leadership of the Skulls.

Director Rob Cohen (Daylight, Fast & The Furious) has never been able to pull any gem from the movies he makes with the only exception being Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.  Instead, he usually creates moderately entertaining movies that try so hard to be more than they are.  This was the last dramatic movie he made before moving into the even more flashy flair of The Fast & The Furious.

The Skulls starts out promising, with good characters trying to deal with their real life and school.  One in particular, Lucas McNamara, played by Joshua Jackson of Dawson's Creek fame, is trying hard to make something of himself, despite his poor roots and semi-criminal childhood.  He does well but mostly plays a similar character to what he played on DC.  Paul Walker, playing Caleb Mandrake, stands out showing some real emotion as the conflicted rich kid who befriends Lucas and battles his own conscious throughout the movie.  You find yourself liking him, despite his `take no responsibility' personality.

The real downfall of the movie is simply the switch in direction from Lucas' journey into sudden wealth and opportunity, to murder mystery.  I think it would have been more instresting to see Lucas work his way into the society and find he is nothing like these people, and either find a way to use the Skulls abilities for good purposes.  William L. Peterson, always good, plays Senator Levritt, who states this to Lucas early in the movie.  This sounded like a promising start to the intrigue that could follow the young man who has never known what it's like to be rich or to have the ability to wield such power.

But alas, the movie falls into bleak territory and barely digs it's way out.  All in all, it's an entertaining movie of power, secret society rules superceding the law and discovery of a person's own moral code.  A good combination that was clumsily executed but is still good on most levels.",1103500800,3,2166,4.782258064516129

We don't get to see much, other than some lame initiation rite and a brief ballroom dance party where beautiful ladies are merely there for the decoration as they are introduced to the new initiates.  What follows is a second rate formula film to unravel the mystery of who's behind the coverup of the murder in the Skulls ritual room.  I was nearly bored to tears.  The only good things about this film were the music and the scene when Joshua Jackson's character flips out, accusing a police officer of switching the videotape to cover up the conspiracy.  He did a great job in that scene, but the rest of the film seriously needed some work.  After I finished watching it, I felt like the makers of this movie didn't know enough about the Skulls to really write and produce a stellar movie.  I wanted to learn more about what a membership in Skulls means to people, besides having beautiful women thrown at them, sports cars of their dreams, and $100,000 checks made out to each member once they are officially part of the brotherhood.

If anything, this film does a service to secret societies, because people will walk away after viewing this film that there's nothing to worry about if members of our government and Wall Street are in the brotherhood.  I hope a more serious film about the social impact of secret societies and its rituals will be made someday, and that such a script/story won't be sacrificed for the purpose of fitting the standard formula of the suspense drama.  Skulls could have used a lot more suspense.  Because of the mediocrity of this film, I won't even bother to watch any of its sequels.

What I got instead was a teen-flick that seemed more like Scream than a movie about the powerful elite that (purportedly) runs countries and continents. Don't get me wrong however, this movie is definitely a thriller but it isn't sinister enough. The Skulls seem more like a group of spoilt brats than a highly efficient secret organization filled with the best minds.
The story was not very credible, how do a group of teenagers bring down such a secretive society that is said to span the globe? Surely the Skulls are not so incompetent as to allow a teen-journalist to enter their most sacred chambers with such ease and steal all their secrets.
There must be better movies about the skulls out there because this one was a real disappointment. I can only recommend this movie to those who like thrillers, just don't get this movie if you are expecting an expose on the skulls.

I think in the end, with movies like this one, they have to be judged on whether the movie was entertaining or not; and this one was...just barely.  What was surprising was that this movie was kept afloat by Paul Walker who plays more of a supporting actor rather than Joshua Jackson, the lead, who makes rather a mess of his role.  Jackson has shown with this movie why he is usually restricted either to the small screen or to supporting roles on the big screen.  Walker, on the other hand, turns in an inspired performance as a rich prep student that is torn between his own morals and conscience and his corrupted father.  As said above, it is Walker who keeps this second rate ""thriller"" above water with his acting skills...there is much more to come from this young, talented and budding actor.  Walker will be the one who will go on to play leading roles and graduate from the teen movie ranks while Jackson will be left wallowing in Walker's wake.  Jackson's acting is one of the many pull downs of this movie.  The movie ends with an unbelvievably cheesy scene and it is very irratating for the movie goer as he/she are left with many nagging questions...what happened to Walker's character after his attempted suicide?  Not to mention all the holes of the story or the below mediocore acting of most of the cast or the dull directing of Rob Cohen or even the lack of development of any the characters...you barely know enough about any of them to evoke some sympathy.

The Skulls was mediocre at best.  Actually, it was below mediocre.  Was it watch able?  Yes, but barely.  The whole concept was pretty outlandish and rather silly.  I can't imagine such a society existing to this extreme extent, but I'm sure there are ones that have the same practices.
Rob Cohen did a terrible job of giving substance to the characters.  I really felt no real feelings towards any of the performers because their backgrounds were either briskly explained or not interesting at all.  It's as if Cohen had one thing in mind, and that was making this secret society as mysterious as possible, and totally forgot about his characters.
Also, the street punks magically turning into brainiacs is unbelievable.  There were many instances like this through out the movie that were down right clich loaded.

1367017,2,B00004X13T,"There are those who believe that a movie critic is usually someone who wouldn't know how to make a movie if his or her life depended on it. I won't argue this point, but I do know that at the core of the process there is writing, which I do know something about. A movie script contains two kinds of writing and is usually composed in two columns. One column is the dialog, while the other contains notes about the setting, the tone and the actors' body language. Some scripts that a studio buys contain a great story but lousy writing. This has created a whole other profession, that of the script doctor. After watching The Skulls, I thought to myself, ""Is there a doctor in the house?""
The Skulls is about a secret society that has existed for decades in an Ivy League university. They never say which school it supposed to be, but since the letter 'Y' is seen several times, I suppose it's Yale. The alumni of this society are very rich and very powerful. To be selected to join it means that one has a leg up in life.
Luke McNamara [Joshua Jackson] is a student from the lower middle class who is working his way through college. This is a stock character in such movies and is written to evoke sympathy in the audience, which is presumed to care less about the ins and outs of rich kids. Luke needs a lot of money to get through law school. The Skulls, he thinks, would be of great benefit to him. When he is chosen he is thrilled, but it doesn't take long for him to find out that there is now a barrier between him and his best friends, Caleb and Chloe [Hill Harper and Leslie Bibb]. When a grisly murder occurs in the society's mansion, Luke discovers he could lose a lot more than just his friends.
This brings us back to the writing, which is so bad that it makes The Skulls enjoyable in a way no one intended it to be. It is one of those movies that make us laugh in all the wrong places. This is the kind of entertainment we watch in morbid fascination, gleefully hoping it gets even worse. In this, The Skulls does not disappoint. There is, for example, an initiation scene in which the new recruits are literally branded on the wrist. They are each then given a new Rolex watch to wear, I guess because this is a secret society. Give us a break! The dialog is so silly that it is impossible to tell if any of the young actors can act or not. Paul Walker, who plays Caleb Mandrake, has a lot of pained expressions on his face, but I can't say for certain if these looks pertain to the lines he is forced to utter.",1016409600,3,2527,4.233954451345756

He finds himself losing things he didn't want to lose at any cost. Now he must fight to get his life back.
My Opinion:  The first half of the movie was very good. I was very entertained and had a great time watching it. None of the ""silliness"" or plot holes bothered me at all. It was easy to get caught up in The Skulls. The second half let down a little and got cheesy. They resorted to old formulas to finish the story.

There's enough suspense to kill an hour and a half without wanting to throw the VCR out the window, but one gets the feeling that with a slightly more capable director (I mean, come on, the guy put Sean Connery in a rubber dragon suit) and less of a focus on casting teen heartthrobs, this could have been a real killer.

In the movie, Luke (Joshua Jackson) demonstrates how joining the Skulls has placed tension on his friendship with Chloe (Leslie Bibb) and his roommate (Hill Harper).  Sworn to keep the happenings of the Skulls a secret, the line between friendship and loyalty to the Skulls becomes very thin.  Luke son learns that the Skulls are not only watching his every move, but they monitor his close friend Chloe as well...

1367041,2,B00004X13T,"As I was watching this movie it reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's films. The theme about an innocent being wrongfully accused, and now must go out and prove his innocence. I kept thinking, what if this movie was made 40 or 50 years ago. Hitchcock would of directed it, Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart would have acted it in, and it would turn out to be a wonderful exciting, suspenseful movie. Instead we get, Rob Cohen directing it, and Joshua Jackson acting it. It sounds like a bit of a let down, doesn't it? A very mediocre film, with mundane performances all over. As this year has went on, I've come to expect nothing short of trash from the movies being made this year. Everything I see, seems to be a let down to me ( ""Me, Myself & Irene"", ""X-Men"", ""Loser"", and ""Isn't She Great"" are prime examples). And this film falls in that list too. Joshua Jackson plays ""Luke"" McNamara. He's trying his hardest to get thru college and wants to get accepted into ""The Skulls"", an elite group of graduates, who can seem to do anything! Paul Walker (Caleb Mandrake)is also one of the students to get accepted into this elite society. After the death of one of the students on campus, ""Luke"" is the main suspect. Now, he and his girlfriend Chloe (Popular's Leslie Bibb) must prove his innocence. But Craig T. Nelson ( Judge Litten Mandrake) will do anything to make sure that ""Luke"" is caught! When it seems as if nobody will believe his story, ""Luke"" fights for his life. I'll give the movie some credit. Some scenes are okay to watch. Some are even a bit exciting. But most of the movie is a brainless, dull, and boring. It never really amounts to much other than being two things. 1- a poor action teen flick, and 2- an excuse for girls to stare at Joshua Jackson on something other than ""Dawson's Creek"". Unless your a girl who happens to be a Jackson fan I suggest everyone else stay away from this film and wait till it comes on cable, maybe even then you shouldn't watch it!",976665600,,1971,4.432506887052342
1367042,4,B00004X13T,"A combination of superb acting and a very good script bring this movie to the top.  Very Fargoesque, in the depressing, money-inspired, greed-filled, sort-of-way.  The director has done a nice job of being able to bring the plot along in a quick, but believable fashion.  I found myself getting sucked in, and becoming less and less shocked at the actions of these guys as they tried to secure their investment.",976579200,,411,4.8428571428571425

The only plus, if you can call it that, is that you can laugh at the moronic dialogue and situations that arise.

The plot is interesting and if you can get past all of the fluff in this one - then you'll enjoy this movie.
For myself, I found myself laughing at this one more than anything else.  ""A skull above any other!""  What the heck does that mean?",976579200,2,550,4.08411214953271
1367045,2,B00004X13T,"This movie didn't do much for me, the DVD edition here has some cool features (which were considered with the review), however the movie is just there. In college one of my history professors told us about an ""secret society"" that existed with it's roots in the ivy leage schools that spaned to upper gorvenment.
The actions of this secret society weren't posed as being negitve (although politcal coruption is likely with any organization) but more a controlling entity that helps focus key descisions.
I'll leave you to be the judge of the turth in this (and does it really matter anyway), The Skulls focuses around how such society can lock in it's members by treating them extreemly well and then expecting them to bond even though corupt illegal acts.
The story is drawn out at points, and leaves the viewer wondering how much footage was left on the cutting room floor to fit this feature down to a reasonable length. Somewhere along the way the movie just doesn't mesh, the soundtrack is laced with good music that tends to pop up at all the wrong moments more so for the sake of ""being a good soundtrack"" than complementing the film. Somewhere along the way the movie stops making sense and becomes unrealistic to the viewer, while the script is still trying to portray a realistic story.
The actors deliver in their roles. Especially Joshua Jackson (the lead character) who will hopefully use this mediocre movie to help launch his career.",976406400,,1448,4.772908366533865

It took a wonderful side of showing how who you are, and what you can do is part of the whole deal.  It stayed at a very interesting level throughout the whole movie which came to me as a shock, and I was amazed at the end how the movie kept me into it the whole time.  The acting is fairly good, and the plot keeps you watching through the whole movie and the ending is no let down.

1367051,3,B00004X13T,"You could only expect to be entertained at a basic level by this wave of insipid, 13 year old girl-geared, teenybopper movies, and this one is no excetion. Pathetic acting from people who were only hired for looks, a plot full of huge holes, and too much eye candy abound. BUT, I have to admit it, on a purely campy, male-fantasy level, this is worth watching. Leave your analytical mind at the door, and just watch this for the sets, the clothes, the money, and the paraphernalia.  The set designer deserves most of the credit-the dramatic Skull sets are worth watching, along with the toney, spacious dorm rooms(they're ridiculously large and overly-furnished-ask any college kid). A particularly pleasing set is Caleb's bachelor pad-esque room, furnished to the nines beyond what any kid could afford. Of course, all of the sabbath-like rituals are undeniably appealing,the same goes for the GQ fashion and the extraneous skull props. So moviegoers, don't think at all on this one, it will just give you a headache, rather just watch it to imagine a life almost nobody can have.",972864000,,1081,4.907103825136612
1367052,3,B00004X13T,"Though it poses a good moral dilemma, ""Skulls"" is presented in such an implausible way as to render it crippled at birth.  Luke McNamara is a small town boy of modest means attending an Ivy League institution that is never really named but is obviously Yale.  He is hoping to be called for membership into the Skulls, a secret society of great status and power.  Members of this society have the doors of power, wealth and influence thrown wide to them.  This is a dream come true for Luke, who spends much of his time fretting over the hundreds of thousands in student loans he is incurring.  When he discovers that one of the members has committed a felony, he is torn between his desire for wealth, his loyalty to a friend, and his conscience.
Writer John Pogue (""U.S. Marshals"") has conjured up a good moralistic tale, but it is so full of ridiculous premises that it becomes laughable.  This is supposed to be a secret society where other than the members themselves, no one knows who the members are.  Yet, Pogue and director Rob Cohen present it in such a way that they may as well be advertising their identities on TV.  The building where the secret meetings take place is prominently marked with a Skull, and only members have keys to the building.  So, Duh, anyone seen entering the building must be a Skull.  New members get brand new $50,000 automobiles and $100,000 in cash, as if no one will notice this sudden burst of good fortune.  The new members are branded on their wrist and we are supposed to believe that they will never be seen by anyone without their wristwatch on.  The list of inconceivability goes on ad nauseam.
The acting is generally quite good.  Joshua Jackson (""Cruel Intentions"", ""Urban Legend"") is excellent as Luke.  He plays the part with just the right combination of idealistic zeal and moral grounding.  He gets great support from Paul Walker (""She's All That"", ""Varsity Blues"") as Caleb Mandrake, the spoiled rich kid trying to step out of his father's shadow.  Craig T. Nelson gives a wonderfully nefarious performance as the chairman of the Skulls and Caleb's father.
Maybe secret societies exist, and maybe they don't.  The fact that no one is sure indicates that if they are more than mere myths, they are a lot more secret than depicted here.  I rated this film a 6/10.  It is an interesting idea that loses credibility in the telling.",972864000,,2382,4.655502392344498

1367054,2,B00004X13T,"Interesting premise but carried to such fantastical extreme as to disabuse.  The story deteriorates from a somewhat intriguing tale to imaginary nonsense.  Director Cohen does say in his commentary that since nobody really knows what goes on in those ""secret"" societies at Yale, Harvard, etc. (and as a Harvard alum I have to add, nobody cares), Cohen and his colleagues could let their imaginations run free.  Well, they did.  Yale, meet the Addams Family and The Munsters.  Morticia and Lurch are more believable than the Skullsters in this thing.  Nicely photographed movie though, especially the ersatz Ivy League interiors, somewhat reminiscent of older edifices at the real Harvard.  Kudos for cinematography.  Thumbs down on plot.

The Skulls also shows how life long connections in business and politics are formed early on during this important time in college. And if we look at the real world of business and politics, we can easily figure out that this flick comes pretty close to reality. Granted, the plot is simple and the acting is often cliche, but the topic is very interesting and the movie was well executed as it keeps the viewer focused. We watched the movie together with folks who are easily bored and rarely consider a movie worth watching, but in the case of The Skulls they all responded with the request to watch it again and to purchase the DVD. There's just something about this movie that leaves the impression that after watching it you learned something and you had a great entertainment experience.

It reminded me of book-to-film adaptations where they leave out key points in the movie that you wouldn't know unless you read the book though clearly can see something is missing.
