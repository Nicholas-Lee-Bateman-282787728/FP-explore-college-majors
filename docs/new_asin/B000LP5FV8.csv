2711241,4,B000LP5FV8,"This volume ends with the beginning of an important subplot involving kind and good intentioned but too-innocent-for-his-own-good Pope Alessandro, but first is a series of episodes that lead to a dramatic conclusion to the story of the slow-burning friendship between Sister Esther and Ion Fortuna.

Already heartbroken and demoralized after what he's been through, Ion has a proverbial knife twisted in him one more time when he learns about Esther's opinion of Methuselah before she met him and he struggles to decide whether the affection growing between them has been real.  His attempts to get to the Empress are thwarted one last time by Dietrich, who has him thrown into a cell with Esther on trumped up charges and shoots him to trigger his body's need for blood - cruelly throwing them a knife to do with as they will and leaving them with an unspeakably horrible decision to make:  which will die to save the other's life?

The outcome is rather predictable, but the intense interaction between the two beforehand is still beautiful, tender in spite of the desperation of their situation, and one of the anime's most memorable and moving scenes.  In this volume, the pair become the living, breathing embodiment of what the Vatican and Methuselah agents of goodwill have been fighting for - and become fan favorites in the process.",1173571200,2,1341,4.96875

A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453

felt somewhat disjointed, rushed...looking back this was about the time the creator of the franchise was dead...but...still, beautiful animation, colors, story line, just sped up...life flashing by in a blink of an eye.  worth watching all volumes, but this is one of the more important ones in the collection.",1241222400,,402,5.0

8162641,4,B000LP5FV8,"This wraps up the New Empire arc pretty handily, if a bit anticlimactically.  We learn a bit more about Cain, but still nothing substantial.",1178409600,,140,4.833333333333333
8162642,5,B000LP5FV8,"I really enjoyed watching this series and now I've even started collecting the novels and manga as well. There's just something about the character of Father Nightroad and his group of companions that makes you want to dig deeper into the story. The anime gives you hints into the Father's dark past and his battle with his evil brother but I think the novels will better answer any questions about that.

The art is amazing, the voice over work is perfect, and the story is filled with action and humor.",1177027200,,504,4.6
