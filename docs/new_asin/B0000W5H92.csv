8003976,5,B0000W5H92,"Quatermass began in 1953 with the six-part BBC miniseries ""The Quatermass Experiment"" written by Nigel Kneale. It was so popular that it spawned two television sequels in 1955 and 1958. They were ""Quatermass II"" and ""Quatermass and the PIt"". The three miniseries were so popular that it spawned movie remakes of all three made by Hammer Films in 1955, 1957, and 1967. This set includes the movie remakes of ""Quatermass 2"" and ""Quatermass and the Pit"".

First in ""Quatermass 2"", British rocket scientist Professor Benard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy, returning to the role from the first film) stumbles upon some strange meteorites and a mysterious top secret government facility surrounded by armed guards. Curious, Quatermass investigates and uncovers not only a government conspiracy, but an alien invasion. A sort of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" combined with ""The X-Files"", ""Quatermass 2"" is a frightening and suspenseful sci-fi horror thriller that would be a shame to miss.

Next in ""Quatermass and the Pit"", London construction workers unearth a cluster of prehistoric bones of ape-men approximately five million years old and beneath that a strange metallic-like object. At first it appears to be an unexploded bomb from the second world war. But on closer inspection, Professor Quatermass believes it to be an alien spacecraft. His theories are confirmed when they manage to open it and uncover alien bodies. Quatermass suspects that these beings created mankind and for a sinister purpose. And that their craft itself may be alive and dangerous. The authorities refuse to heed Quatermass' warnings and soon the craft unleashes sinister otherworldly forces that threatens the entire world. Scottish actor Andrew Keir takes over the roll of Quatermass, and does a fine job. The movie is creepy, suspenseful, and thought-provoking. Another film you do not want to miss out on.

Highly Recommended!",1457222400,2,1905,5.322259136212624
8003977,5,B0000W5H92,"QUATERMASS AND THE PIT (aka: FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH) begins w/ the discovery of ancient skeletal remains, during a subway tunneling project. Dr. Mathew Roney (James Donald) is convinced that the specimens are five million years old. Startlingly, what appears to be some sort of weapon is also unearthed. Enter Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Keir), called in by the military to examine the suspected ""missile"". Quatermass and Roney quickly unite, disagreeing entirely w/ Colonel Breen (Julian Glover) and his ""un-exploded bomb"" theory. Further investigation, and some very strange occurrences, lead the two scientists to some incredible, otherworldly conclusions. This movie really gets going toward the end, when all hell breaks loose! QUATERMASS 2 ENEMY FROM SPACE- Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) is thrust into the middle of an alien invasion / government conspiracy, when a moon base model from his lab is discovered, full size and functional, sitting in the British countryside! Teaming up w/ Inspector Lomax (John Longden) and a member of parliament named Broadhead (Tom Chatto), Quatermass investigates a local food production facility. This leads to a terrifying discovery, and a gigantic blob-monster finale! This is a wonderful double feature, worthy of several viewings...",1441065600,,1289,5.615384615384615
8003978,4,B0000W5H92,"Absolutely terrific 50's sci-fi! My favorite of the two films was Quatermass 2. The plot was quite acceptable from a scientific standpoint, and on that basis was quite scary because logic dictated it was possible.",1385769600,,213,5.114285714285714
8003979,1,B0000W5H92,"QUATERMASS 2 is a great vintage Hammer sci-fi movie, currently unavailable on the DVD market, so I was happy to find it here. But the worn-out VHS tape being streamed here at Amazon Instant Viewing is UNWATACHABLE. So dark you can't tell what's going in in many scenes; when you can, the image is degraded and blurry, with glitches from the stretched-out VHS tape. Shame on Amazon for foisting such a lousy product on a paying audience. If Amazon wants to gain the trust of viewers and get a share of the instant viewing market, they will have to do much, much better than this.",1300492800,3,578,4.514285714285714
8003980,2,B0000W5H92,"The film itself is great, a Hammer classic. But I can't recommend this release from ""Artiflex."" it was obviously converted from a vhs cassette and looks just awful: grainy picture, terrible sound, even occasional tracking artifacts like strips of rainbow color moving up the screen. A staggeringly lazy package. I question whether the company actually has the rights to this film. They certainly don't have an actual print to work from.",1298764800,2,436,5.154929577464789
8003981,5,B0000W5H92,"Much has already been said about these two movies. I just want to add that some of the effects in Quatermass and the Pit are very good, like the giant grasshopper at the end. All in all the best thing about these both is the excellent story telling. Particularly Quatermass and the Pit. When I first saw this as a kid I didn't know whether it was horror or science fiction, it has both and is told very well. I consider this to be one of the definitive science fiction movies of the era. Nothing like this one has ever been done since. This set of movies for sci-fi was equally the quality equivalent of Hammer's Mummy and Dracula movies.",1245628800,2,638,4.325
8003982,5,B0000W5H92,"Intelligent stories that really draw you in. Great acting, direction and cinematography. AND music! Science fiction is wonderful for being able to express ideas that would otherwise never see the light of day, and both of these movies feature sinister conspiracies or incredible contrasts and truths about life on our dear little rock. There's a terrific scene in ""Five Million Years to Earth"" aka ""Quatermass and the Pit"" with a bunch of ""normal"" guys using new-found psychic abilities to stone to death another guy who's not one of them -- no dialogue, but true horror. Both movies feature disquieting ideas. Quatermass is an impressive character, played by two different actors. There's another Quatermass movie out there called ""The Creeping Unknown"" but it's not on a par with these two movies. ""Quatermass and the Pit"" builds to a climax where an alien intelligence takes over London and -- well,  you've got to see it. Both stories are complicated and if you're a science fiction fan you will find them *delectable* -- absolutely worth the money on their own and if you buy this set you'll be getting a real deal. Two of the best science fiction films in my modest-but-considered science fiction collection. Truly impressive films. And, like I wrote, science fiction allows creators to express ideas that couldn't even be broached otherwise.",1112227200,11,1348,5.072072072072072
8003983,4,B0000W5H92,"Quatermass II is the real gem here and the director commentary adds an extra dimension to the understanding of the fimmaker's vision for a story that is imaginative and well written.

Brian Donlevy's performance as an American scientist in Britain is quite believable and noteworthy.  I particularly like Val Guest's imaginative use of photography and specific sets (i.e. the Shell Refinery south of London) used as the enemy's secret lair. Not a horror film per se, but a disturbing one nonetheless. Although somewhat dated, the film keeps your interest throughout.",1092009600,10,566,5.277777777777778
8003984,5,B0000W5H92,"I have been waiting for the re-release of these movies, especially the final movie in the trilogy, Quatermass and the Pit, for a long time. I saw both of these as second billed movies way, way back when I was young......Quatermass 2(called ""Enemy From Space"" in the U.S.A.), when I was really young, and Quatermass and the Pit (called Five Million Miles to Earth...) when I was a teen. Both movies are super creepy, in the old fashioned sense........not a lot of fantastic special effects, but enough to keep the stories moving along. The effects are certainly powerful though, and really well done considering.........they are a tribute to the incredible talent at work making these films, and they are great examples of Hammer Films at their best. Both are good, well written, original stories, with the emphasis on acting and great directing. It is great storytelling.....and unfortunately some of the last of the great films to come out of Hammer Studios. Standout acting from all involved, and that is the key to believing these stories.......pretty fantastic stories, played straight all the way through. Professor Quatermass is such a great character, with a long history in British film and TV..... and Brian Donlevy in Quatermass 2 and Andrew Kier in Quatermass and the Pit are standouts. Anchor Bay does such a good job with these old film releases.....if you are a Sci-Fi nut, this is certainly a double bill you would be proud to have in your collection. Great job, and thank you Anchor Bay!! Finally!!!
ENJOY!!!!!",1074902400,37,1526,4.96484375
