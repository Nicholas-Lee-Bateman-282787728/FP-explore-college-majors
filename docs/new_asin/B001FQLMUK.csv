3588265,4,B001FQLMUK,"High profile assassin, Gilda, embarks on a journey with unlikely suspect Lin, a high class Chinese call girl. The bond between the 2 friends solidifies as they confront compromising and jeopardous situations. Their friendship gives them strength to stare death and deceit in the face as they risk having it all or losing it all in their femme fatale mission of vengeance.

This movie has lots of action, seduction and deceit. The 2 girls are both involved in a plot that puts them in a dangerous situation. Their enemy is close by and they are just 1 wrong move from being found out. I was really impressed by the fight scenes and Andrea Osvart's sexiness. The other chick is pretty average looking, but she's tough and kicks major butt. This movie is a typical femme fatale flick, but if you like that type of movie, this one will entertain you. I honestly don't think this movie is worth buying, I recommend just renting it.",1354406400,4,926,4.646341463414634
3588266,5,B001FQLMUK,This is a great film with the not normal male posing as a hitman and even with being a hit person for hire it does have it's draw backs. There is a lot of twist and turns in this movie so have your popcorn and your drink ready because if you get up you might miss a very good part!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!,1347321600,3,297,3.8852459016393444
3588267,2,B001FQLMUK,"Misrepresentation is a common commercial tactic in the marketing of DTV films of this era. Check out the DVD cover of ""Two Tigers"", here: a long-haired woman wields a sword in front of a fiery sky and a tall Asian architecture. Looks pretty cool, huh? The back of the case features, among other images, two shirtless martial artists doing combat in front of a plaque featuring a dragon. Judging by these images, you'd assume that you're in for a full-on martial arts flick, right? Wrong! What we have here is a poor man's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B00004XMSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>, all but devoid of martial arts and action in general. I dub it an adult softcore fantasy involving spies and lies; a pulpy but thoroughly boring daydream by somebody who likes his women dangerous and bi-curious. The sword, martial artists, and even the hairstyle featured on the case are nonexistent, as is just about any reason to watch this mind-numbing chore of a movie.

The story: sent on a mission in Shanghai, deadly assassin Gilda (Andrea Osvart,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aftershock/dp/B00D2UMHUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aftershock</a>) makes friends with her condo neighbor, beautiful call girl Lin (Selena Khoo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heatseeker/dp/6303460089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heatseeker</a>). Throughout events involving Gilda's assignments, a love affair gone wrong, and attempts on both of their lives by the local mafia, the two forge a bond to see eachother through their secret lifestyles.

The most significant thing I can say about this film is that it's one of the few movies that literally sapped my energy: within 25 minutes of watching, I felt listless and completely apathetic to the world. While this is merely my personal reaction to the movie's complete lack of intrigue, I'm hard-pressed to imagine what anybody else could find to like about the movie. The international pop soundtrack is kind of neat, but that doesn't make up for the stunted acting (made worse by nobody in the cast being a native English speaker), intrigue-free story, three absolute garbage fight scenes, and the feeling that director spent most of the time trying to come up with filler material for in between the four or five scenes of bare breasts.

Judging by the video quality, this was a very cheap movie to make, but it does feature an occasional flair for pretty cinematography. This doesn't carry over to the handful of fight scenes, which are not only short but also set some kind of record for the amount of cheat camera angles and quick-cut editing squeezed into ten seconds at a time. Gilda's and Lin's relationship does take a nice, suggestive turn at the very end of the movie, but up until then, it's mainly them sitting around and engaging in girl talk and giving eachother advice that may or may not be applicable to the world outside of the film. The few opportunities to inject some potential interest in the movie - (SPOILER) like when Gilda receives instructions to assassinate Lin and her beloved client (Olivier Pages,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Rey/dp/B00423B7TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Rey</a>) - are not taken advantage of: they're built up but eventually more or less resolve themselves.

The movie simply drags too much for too long, too often. In better circumstances, this could have been used as building time towards some sort of cool, climatic payoff, but nope! - not only was I scratching my head at the lack of coherency of how the plot tied itself up, but I was also yawning at how unspectacular it was. If you've picked up films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-Warrior/dp/B001LXIDUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the Warrior</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cut-Off/dp/B0016QNSCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cut Off</a>, then you'll be familiar with the game of deceptive marketing played by this movie. If you like your film fare low on action and high on figurative wandering, then by all means, pick this up...but anybody looking for an actual action flick, keep looking - it's not here at all.",1266019200,5,4399,5.86875
3588268,2,B001FQLMUK,"In the fine tradition of Italian Cinema knockoffs comes this co-produced Italian/Chinese film called Two Tigers. The box art would believe one to expect a female ninja assassin film but it's not. Yes Gilda is an assassin and a good one but she's no ninja. The story involves two women Gilda played by Hungarian beauty Andrea Osvart a hired killer and Lin played by Selena Khoo a high priced call girl. Their paths meet when Gilda is in Shanghai China to kill a Lebanese mobster. Lin is being hassled by some local thugs and Gilda comes to her rescue. From their our two tigers bond .Lin is hoping to marry french man Michael whom has been a client of hers for some time. He professes his love to her and offers to leave his wife. Now things get sticky when Gilda's employers accept a contract that demands that Gilda kill both Michael and Lin. So the assassin has a dilema does she turn down the contract and risk being targeted for termination herself? or does she do the deed and kill her new friends ?As and added bonus Gilda meets a man in Shanghai as well and the international police are after the woman known as the tiger. There is even a teased physical attraction between Lin and Gilda thrown in the mix. I've read reviews elsewhere that were quite down on Two Tigers. Well it's hardly great cinema it's not as bad as others have said. Osvart and Khoo are both attractive and suit the roles given each. Neither is a great actress or skilled martial artist. The actions acceptable,the nudity ample but not overly explicit and the scenes of Shanghai are interesting. If you like La Femme Nikita wannabee's give Two Tigers a look it's a fair night's viewing.",1255219200,4,1664,4.53156146179402
3588269,4,B001FQLMUK,"I liked the movie Two Tigers but  I am obsessed with  the first and  last song  of the movie. They are one in the same though.  Well,  I mean  it's the same song but  I am trying to  find the soundtrack to this movie  but  I CAN'T SEEM  to find it.  Can anyone help me with the name of the song  and the singer of the  first and  Last song of  the  Two Tigers movie ?  thanks  it  was  a good movie  not the best but  enough action in it.  Alot of sexual scenes and  blood scenes too  . The two main girls ( tigers)  are sexy too.",1234656000,5,530,3.6574074074074074
3588270,4,B001FQLMUK,"Some reviewers on imdb trashed this film, but I absolutely love it.  It's sexy without being pornographic, and it moves along at just the right pace; just slow enough so you can tell what's going on; but something is always going on!  There are definite lesbian overtones, although all the sex is heterosexual.  Andrea Osvart is fantastic.  Selena Khoo, not so good; her physical acting is great, but her dialog is B movie stilted.  I found the plot original and interesting.  I also really like the soundtrack.

I think an ""A"" production would have had a better actor than Khoo, or maybe reshot to get her scenes right.  Overall, though, I liked it better than many full scale productions such has ""Crouching Tiger..."" and the new disaster of similar plot with Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, ""Wanted"".

I recommend this film for fans of action, soft porn, and of ""relationship"" movies.",1230249600,13,890,4.841059602649007

8302391,4,B001FQLMUK,"The ad for this movie make it sound like there will be a lot of ninja fighting, but there was very little. It is more about 2 women, one who sells herself and one who is an assassin who become good friends, but not lesbian friends. They are both are with men, but support each other as caring friends, but again, no lesbian relationship is in this even though Amazon listed it that way. It is a good movie, but if you were looking for a lesbian romance, don't get this film. If you want a feel good movie about an unusual friendship--whore and assassin, this is a good one. I would even venture to say that this is more of a ""woman's movie"". There isn't really a whole lot of violence, but there is some. Not for children.",1414800000,,722,4.201438848920863
8302392,4,B001FQLMUK,"The cover is misleading. This isn't an action movie. The main character never uses a sword on anyone. It is a relationship movie. The main character does kill a few people and is skilled at martial arts but that isn't the main story. It is a story of two women. There are a few fights but no big deal. Normally I would have given the movie 3 stars because the story isn't that great. It's OK but that's all. There are some inconsistencies but who cares? The extra star comes from the exposure of Andrea Osv&aacute;rt's beautiful body and very lovely breasts. She often dresses in clinging tops that show her attributes, never with a bra. She is truly eye-candy. That's why the extra star. On that level it is very enjoyable.",1399593600,,724,4.492424242424242

8302394,4,B001FQLMUK,"This is a fun flix where sexy girls kick ass, Andrea Osvart is apprently the star here, who is innocent looking yet very sexy - and in a very good way. On top of that I also think she is an excellent actress.

There are some loopholes in the plot, but the pace is pretty good and suspence is building up nicely, there are some nice footages from Shanghai city of China, the ending is suprising.

The sound track in the end is from Sun Yanzi (English name Stefanie Sun), who is a Singaporean, the song is called ""green light"" in case you are curious. You may find the video here [...]",1373414400,2,583,4.196428571428571
