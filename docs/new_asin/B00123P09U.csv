8243676,5,B00123P09U,"This was one of my children's favorite videos to watch when they were younger and we all still like to watch it even today. It is very informative and educational for all ages, even adults, but the cuteness factor is what makes it a favorite. OK, it is old and a bit grainy and the sound is a bit wobbly at times, but we still love this video and wish it was on DVD! Six hours of fun!",1396828800,,384,3.9358974358974357
