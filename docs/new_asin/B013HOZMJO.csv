I enjoy both English and SUBS,  but sometimes when you get home from work you really just don't want to read any more and kick back and enjoy a English Dub of a wonderful anime.",1500508800,,322,4.0
8727713,5,B013HOZMJO,"this is what anime should be. this is a sweet, heartfelt and amazing story of a young girl seeing her life through photographs old and new.the characters are well thought out, the animation is beautifull and the music superb. this story touched me so much where I cannot recommend it highly enough. Tamayura is an anime that your whole family can watch together and be moved like never before.",1492300800,,393,4.7101449275362315

8727715,5,B013HOZMJO,"This was a mostly cheerful, slice of life, with some comedy, anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the animation was great. Lots of heart. You don't have to be a girl to watch a good show.",1461628800,,186,4.194444444444445
8727716,3,B013HOZMJO,"I watched this online last year with subtitles for free and thought it was fun and possibly worth another viewing, so when I saw it was on DVD both dubbed and subtitled in English I bought it. However it is just subtitled and has NO English audio.  So buy only if you don't mind reading subtitles :)",1451433600,7,299,4.245614035087719

8727718,5,B013HOZMJO,I like this anime. Story and artwork is really good. Little bite a girly to it but it is good. The reason I got it because my dad and I was into photo and dark room. Even though we did our own thing. I can relate to this story!,1446768000,,227,3.6530612244897958

8727720,5,B013HOZMJO,"If you enjoy 'slice-of-life' anime, then this is a definite must-see show for you. It's all about the characters, and their lives in their town, and doing things with their friends.  It focuses on Fuu (nicknamed 'Potte' by her friends) and her trying to be a better photographer, but the story gives time to the other girls in the group, so each character gets a chance to shine, and to grow.

The tone of the whole show is very gentle, and slow but not so slow as to be boring. I found it the perfect show to leave in the DVD player, so it was waiting for me after I got home from a horrible day at work, to sit and watch and let a bit of my soul be restored.

This DVD contains the original OVA video releases, and the entire first season.  A second season was made, as well as a series of four movies currently (2015) being shown in Japan.  This is how good a series this is, that there was that much demand in Japan for more of it.  I certainly hope the second season and the movies are also licensed for North America as well.",1444521600,7,1031,4.13
