7977012,4,B00007JZUH,"This movie tries too hard on the musical numbers and the day-before-Christmas typcasting will make adults wince, but the basic moral of the story is right on! A beautiful undersea kingdom is caught up in the consumerism and selfishness of Christmas. The town's Archenemy, Professor Pinch, is bent on destroying the town's much anticipated Christmas celebration. But with the help of a lost, pregnant Turtle family, the town rediscovers the true meaning of Christmas. I look forward to adding other ""Kingdom Under the Sea"" titles to our collection.",1074124800,8,547,5.2272727272727275
