8764267,3,B01GWOQIW6,"While this is sadly yet another bootleg, the still existing commercials, time slots showers, and other commercials within the show makes it as clear as daylight that it is the broadcast versions of the episode and the English subtitle option makes it clear that it is pretty much Overtime or Aizen's subtitles. So if you are going to pick it up, it's more about your opinion on the show (which is good) and your opinion on Overtime or Aizen's subtitle work. (Which is also good, unless it's episode six, where they butchered Oren's personal speech)",1499040000,3,548,4.778947368421052
