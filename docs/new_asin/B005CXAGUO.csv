If you are a fan of Melissa Anderson (Cheerleader Melissa and Raisha Saeed) you will be happy and sad.  Happy because she has some standout performances, but truly sad because of the jobs she had to do.  The absolute worst match I have EVER seen was on this recording, with Cheerleader Melissa losing to a talentless Lacey Von Erich.  It's been said that Melissa could carry a broomstick to a quality match. Too bad the broomstick is much better than Lacey.  Also the La Nazi/Melissa match was subpar, but passable.  The rest of the show is anywhere from good to darned good, including some ODB hijinks with Candice LaRae and a really good match with Cheerleader Melissa and TNA's Tracy Brooks that started out in the ring and became a hardcore match halfway through that brawled all the way through the arena.

If you are a fan of the TNA Knockouts or the NXT Women, you will enjoy this.  If you are a WWE Divas fan, this is so much better than Vinnie Mac ever will give you.",1449360000,,1081,4.507692307692308
