8667742,5,B00LQA5044,"The Film is brilliant, it seems to play within the 2nd Year in school for Marika. The Bentenmaru shows no modifications as for the Battle in season 2. The Movie is not subbed (original Japan version) The story is very good to understand even if you do not speak Japanese, Marika is established as the Captain and President of the yacht club.
The DVD Blue Ray set comes in a sturdy Box with additional Documentation ( Japanese). The Japanese vendor took care with the shipping, I have no issues to report with the Packing or delivery time for the Item. ( came way before due date)",1424822400,,579,4.471698113207547
