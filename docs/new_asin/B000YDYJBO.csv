A wonderful addition to your video library.  Yeah, I know it's VHS.  Don't let that stop you from owning this awesome workout.  Just transfer it into DVD format and keep it movin'!

The Body Dome is no longer in production,  but you can still get it from some sellers.  If not, there are similar products that this video routine can easily be used with.",1384819200,,569,4.833333333333333
