8424416,5,B004D0005S,Helene Staton is always worth the time to watch. I am happy with this purchase.,1464652800,,79,4.333333333333333
8424417,3,B004D0005S,"This is ""noir light""..usually dirty dealings on the docks and ""honest joe""  arthur franz just wants to run boat loads of wood up and down the river. Between those  two plot points revolves the meat of the movie. well done, not too sinister. actual New Orleans city officials appear in the film with speaking roles. unless you hav run through a lot of ""noir"" films, you could probably do better",1409529600,3,393,4.6
8424418,4,B004D0005S,"Overall this movie was what I expected.  It was OK.  The script was probably very good but the movie itself is disjointed and not exactly easy to follow.  That being said, I did not buy this for the movie but because it was filmed on location in New Orleans.  I study New Orleans history and loved seeing shots of the city in the mid 50's.  For me it was worth buying.",1405814400,4,368,4.126760563380282
8424419,4,B004D0005S,"My grandfather was an actor in this movie.  He played a ""bad"" guy that started the dock fire and he's in a couple extra scenes.  I so enjoyed seeing him.  He died on my birthday in 1984 and It's been so long since I have seen him.  I loved seeing a bit of my own history as well as N.O.'s history.  Thanks Columbia!",1320451200,9,315,3.9365079365079363
