4587729,5,B0056AJD9S,"I rented this movie and was not suprised. It was your typical bigfoot movie with a few new twists added to it. John Schneider (dukes of Hazard) was the star of it. He could probably not slide thru the window of the General Lee as easy. But, it is a good movie, not too much gor or blood, they gave u the imagination of it happening. All and all i would not hesitate to rent it again.",1330560000,,383,3.987012987012987
4587730,3,B0056AJD9S,"""Snowbeast"" is a 2011 TV remake of the 1977 TV film of the same name. This one stars John Schneider.

The titular monster is a yeti, basically a bigfoot that lives high in the snowy mountains. In the original film the snowbeast was hanging around Crested Butte ski resort, Colorado, which is where the film was shot; this remake largely takes place around a posh cabin in the Canadian Rockies. A ski resort is nearby but you'll barely see it. The original movie ripped-off the plot of ""Jaws"" verbatim and just relocated it to a ski resort while this remake throws out most of the ""Jaws"" similarities.

The yeti in the original looked quite good for a TV film from 1977, nice and malevolent. I suppose it helped that you hardly got to see the creature. Less is more, as they say.

Which brings us to the main problem with this remake: The yeti is fully seen early on and continues to appear throughout the rest of the film. This wouldn't be a problem if the monster costume was convincing, but that's not the case. The head and face look good, especially the eyes and mouth - very monstrous - but the rest of the costume looks really fake. The body of fur just doesn't look real or lived-in. In fact, it looks like the beast just came from the dry cleaners. Couldn't the producers have spent another grand on the title creature's appearance?

But the cast is good and likable. John Schneider plays a scientist studying lynx in Canada. He brings two colleagues and his daughter from Florida. Meanwhile, the local police department investigates a couple cases of missing persons that, of course, lead to the beast.

For some reason, Schneider is perfect for these types of roles. He's just an all-around quality protagonist. Jason London is also on hand as one of the policeman.

Another big plus are the two women: Danielle Chuchran, who plays Schneider's teen daughter Emmy, and Kari Hawker, who plays Schneider's young brunette colleague, Marci, with whom he seems to have a (mutual) interest. Each is totally gorgeous in different ways.

The snowy Rocky Mountain locations are another plus; very scenic.

CONCLUSION: Both films are about the same quality, although the original version loses points for being a wholesale rip-off of ""Jaws."" Each were made as traditional monster movies and are therefore pleasantly derivative. In other words, don't look for originality or cutting edge cinema, just enjoy them for what they are. The only major flaw of this remake is the fake-looking fur suit of the creature, which engenders laughs more than frights (although, again, the head & face look good). The plot is much thinner than the original, but the story is somehow less boring, which indicates solid storytelling or maybe they hooked me in with the likable cast. Probably both.

GRADE: C+ or a strong 3/5 Stars",1327276800,,2811,4.779381443298969
4587731,3,B0056AJD9S,"I am a big fan of the original film with Bo Svenson And when I found this one day and rented it was happy with what I watched. It Didn't have the same creature handling as the first one ( classic don't see the creature to the end formula) And You can see the hard recovery of Jason London in his face, but he does give a solid performance. Now if we could only take the original and thisd one and combined them for a awesome film...",1325894400,5,432,3.9770114942528734
4587732,3,B0056AJD9S,"True, Snow Beast has absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever.  I doubt that even the filmmakers would have the gall to claim otherwise.  This is, at its lowest, base and unadulterated drivel, crap by any other name: garbage, junk, call it what you will (a paycheck for John Schneider & Jason London), it doesn't espouse to be anything other than what it is: a throwback to an era when monster movies were made fast and on the cheap.
The questionable yeti at the heart of this piece is every bit as chintzy as anything manufactured during the 50s.  That's part of its dubious charm, this was a monster costume slapped together at a moment's notice than shoved in front of a camera.  There isn't an angle or lighting good enough to hide its flaws.  It's tacky.  I've seen faked footage that at least tried to make the abominable snowman look real!
As for the plot: a divorced wildlife researcher (John Schneider) drags his crabby daughter with him on his annual research trip to study Lynx in Canada.  Problem is, no Lynx.  So, they study a whole lot of nothing until this pesky yeti raids their garbage cans.  Thank goodness there's a local ranger (Jason London) on hand to help.  Naturally, the yeti has an enormous appetite and fortunately, there's plenty of food on hand to keep the body count high.  Apparently, yetis don't hibernate so a lot of fresh food is required to keep it happy.
I grew up watching all those crappy monster movies of the 50s and 60s so I have very low expectations.  I can easily see watching this one again as a double feature night of monster movies (with the second feature being the better one.....not that difficult a feat considering).

I'm keeping it; it struck me as unassuming-dopey-fun.

I'm easily amused.

But it is crap.",1319760000,5,1760,4.650485436893204
4587733,5,B0056AJD9S,"Ok, I'm a sucker for Bigfoot movies.  I LOVE the subject matter and how cool is the legend of Bigfoot?  This movie DOES contain some special magic to it.  First off, hats off to John Schneider for a really good performance in this little fable.  He really carries off his character well and has such a likeable screen presence that you can't help but actually care about his character.  Another noteable atribute is the gorgeous cinematography.  The film encompasses such a ""rustic"" feel that you kind of want to watch this with the fireplace going and a hot cup of chocolate.  The scenes of the forest and mountains with the snow are really impressive for a film in this genre. Another thing I really liked about this was, it DOES contain violence, but doesn't go over the top with it.  Also, the absence of profanity was a welcome addition as well.  From what I gathered, the producers of this film went out to make a traditional ""monster movie"" that could have been made just the same about 50 years ago.
The film is fast paced, suspenseful, and contains just the right touches of humor and fun.
I would very much recommend this to fans of Bigfoot movies and actually fans of earlier horror films as well.  I thought this movie actually would have kind of been interesting if shot in black and white.
All that said. Order a pizza, get some beverages of your choice and just enjoy this buffet of monster madness.  I really think this will be a film much celebrated by Bigfoot enthusiasts and fans of campy horror films.
Much recommended!",1318723200,31,1539,4.58029197080292
4587734,1,B0056AJD9S,"I'm going to keep this brief, because there is not much to say that my title doesn't.

On first becoming aware of a new Snow Beast I was genuinely excited because I am a huge fan of the 1977 original (which by the way deserves a legitimate high-def transfer and release. The current DVD editions,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snowbeast/dp/B00077BOOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snowbeast</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Horror-Collection/dp/B000929AUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Horror Collection</a>, being just a step removed from VHS). I hold it in the highest regard, and consider it to be one of the very few legitimately well done Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti horror films, and a staple of the genre.

That said, Snow Beast (2011), which is not a remake, but instead a particularly drone re-imagining, was absolutely terrible. And decidedly not terrible in the way some bad films retain a sense of dignified charm. It appears a modicum of effort was put into this production. And that's being generous. The directing is terrible. The story, poorly scripted and uninteresting. The Snow Beast in question is a basic scary Yeti Halloween costume, and the special effects are among the worst I've ever seen. In fact&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yeti-Maneater-Series/dp/B001H5X6S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yeti: Maneater Series</a>, another fairly terrible addition to the genre, is akin to a work of art in comparison. That should speak volumes to true Sasquatch film aficionados. The only even remotely salvageable aspects of this atrocity are John Schneider (Dukes of Hazzard), who hams it up regardless of the fact that this is possibly the lowest point of his career. And Jason London (Dazed and Confused), who, though somewhat bloated and appearing significantly depressed, was OK nevertheless. If anything at all good comes of this, it will be that it leads to some real work for Schneider and London, both of whom are talented, and yet obviously struggling under the yoke of fleeting fame.

In conclusion: The fact that (unlike the above mentioned Yeti which at least had substance enough to get picked up and broadcast as a Syfy Channel original movie) Snow Beast went straight to DVD, should be a big red flag. And that the distributor is Sun World Pictures, bigger red flag. All said, while young children might enjoy this film for it's amateurish ""Goosebumps"" production values, for genre fans like myself I'd recommend skipping this dud (at least until it's in the bargain bin).",1317945600,9,2651,5.862694300518135

And all the bodies have been stored in an ice cave on the mountain.  And there is video footage of the yeti.  And trails of blood all over cars and snow mobiles abandoned all over the woods. Who wouldn't get a chuckle out of not being believed after witnessing so many brutal deaths and mangled bodies?

4587837,4,B0056AJD9S,"SNOW BEAST (2011) is the -sort of- remake of the original frozen cheeeze-log, of the same name, from 1977. John Schneider (THE CURSE, CONJURER) stars as wildlife researcher, Jim Harwood, who takes his teen daughter, Emmy (Danielle Chuchran), along to Canada on a research project. He and his team set out to do their work, unaware that a a huge yeti-monster is on a rampage, slaughtering innocent humans. Of course, the divorced Harwood is accompanied by a beautiful colleague, named Marci (Kari Hawker). Could romance be far off? Not if the SNOW BEAST can tear them apart first! Meanwhile, Emmy gets herself into various scrapes, committing acts of hijinks and frivolity. Oh yeah, and the SNOW BEAST continues to lower the skier / snow-boarder population in the area, in bloody ways. This is no plodding, ""slow"" beast either! This thing can move! While not the scariest or most realistic-looking creature, the SB does have a certain charm. It looks a lot like a very angry version of the Bumble Snow Monster from RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED  REINDEER! Yukon Cornelius would certainly have his hands full w/ this fuzzy fiend! This is an odd film, in that it has its sudden death scenes, interspersed w/ touching father / daughter moments. It's almost like a Hallmark film w/ added gore! Very bizarre indeed. Still, not a bad way to waste an evening in front of the fireplace...

The screenwriter must have been on a time crunch so he just grabbed ideas from the Cheap Screen Writer Cliche' Grab Bag (I think he moonlights as the guy who writes stuff on the backs of cereal boxes). The cinematographer and music directors phoned their jobs in after tossing down some Prozac with vodka. We have an angsty teen girl who acts like a total bitch, rolls her eyes and says, ""That's so lame."", a monster somehow removed from the planet Hoth and given a new arm (after a certain young Jedi lopped it off). And oh yeah...they have ugly locals complaining about damned college kids. That's a new angle (deep sigh).
I am wondering why, if they insist on using cookie cutters to make these movies, they don't just issue red shirts to all the victims ahead of time. It's not like we have to guess anymore on who is going to get it.
