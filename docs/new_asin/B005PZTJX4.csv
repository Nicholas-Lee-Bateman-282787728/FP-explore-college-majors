8482801,5,B005PZTJX4,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film on architect Gaudi when it was first produced. It impressed me at the time and I always wanted to see it again. But like so many film it disappeared and was lost. Or seemingly so. Recently the film was rediscovered and the director, John Alaimo has been fortunate in that he has been able to secure it for DVD release, something that was impossible all those years ago. So now this little gem is available to all; to those who admire the works of Gaudi; to those who are new to his name and his works; to filmmakers and those who appreciate the art of film. This intelligent film is the ideal introduction to the great man's work and I for one am delighted to view it again. I recommend it to all.
