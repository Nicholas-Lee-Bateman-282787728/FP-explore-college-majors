3848098,3,B0025B206O,"I think that its really funny that some reviewers for this film are so offended by the people who didn't ""get it"" and accuse them of wanting to be ""spoon fed"". How these reviewers can overlook the glaring problems with this movie I'll never know. They perceive the schizophrenic plot as a challenge to the normal Hollywood formulas. But if you're an indie fan you know that a film can be challenging and still comprehensible.

I enjoyed the film because of all the things that are wrong with it. Its scatterbrained plot, confusing narrative and wandering focus make me strive to glean the movie wheat from the movie chaff.

Despite the director's best efforts to overwhelm the movie with meaning about the mythology of heroes, I thought the actors' performances were stand-out.  Steve Coogan takes on another unlikeable character and strives to make him tolerable, which is commendable, but he is never given clear dominion over the film. In an apparent effort to pander to the teen audience, his character (the lead), is upstaged time and again by the misfits from the shed. The teens are art class cliches that we have seen a dozen times but the actors make the most of their lot and if you haven't seen Freaks and Geeks, My So Called Life or any Lifetime movie where a girl is ""too young"" for something then you won't care.

The film is shot beautifully so it's even sadder when it narratively starts a death spiral. And as it crashes and burns we finally see the parallel between the Challenger tragedy and this movie. The Challenger was destroyed and this movie self-destructs. I guess the heroes are us, for watching it.",1245628800,6,1626,4.714788732394366
3848099,5,B0025B206O,"What Goes Up is a film that far exceeded my expectations for any new upcoming Hilary Duff films.  She beautifully plays a character that seems to be searching for something to fill a gap that has been placed in her life by the death of someone she and her friends loved and worshipped.  This movie seems to leave the Hollywood mold behind (very thankfully!) and shows us just how realistic life is, and how it's not perfect at all like most movies would try to make it seem.  The other actors are fantastic as well, especially Olivia Thirlby and Steve Coogan.

This movie is highly recommended and I really loved it.  Very fantastic film for our times.",1245456000,5,652,4.538461538461538
3848100,5,B0025B206O,"I was fortunate to see this film at the Los Angeles premiere, and I thought it was outstanding. The characters here are real, and that means unglamorous. But isn't that what real life is? Steve Coogan does a spot-on  job as Campbell Babbitt, a departure from the roles we've come to expect from him. But a more dramatic turn suits him well. Hilary Duff, Olivia Thirlby and Josh Peck were excellent, bringing their flawed characters to life in a very real and believable way.

For me, some of the supporting cast members particularly stood out, especially Max Hoffman (Dustin's son) as Fenster and ""twins"" Ingrid Nilson and Andrea Brooks. These are real people. Nilson especially was just dynamite, and I found myself wishing that there would have been time to explore these characters a bit deeper.

 I think the writers did a fine job with this story and the concept of what makes a hero or maybe whether all of our heroes really aren't heroic after all. There were a few places that could have been tighter, but this film was never meant to be perfect, and for that I am glad. Kudos to Jonathan Glatzer on a uniquely different film. I love it.",1245369600,10,1145,4.598039215686274
3848101,5,B0025B206O,"At first, I wasn't sure where it was going... Up, down or just sideways. But soon, I realized the filmmakers were creating a world that resembled reality far more than almost any movie I've seen in that there are collisions between events, intentions, characters, loves, hates ...and the whole stew can be hysterically funny, odd, disturbing, heartbreaking and then funny all over again. In this way, I have to give the film enormous credit and gratitude that it does not try to be like every other movie. It does not talk down to its audience.

It takes place in 1986 in the days before the Challenger Shuttle blew up, but the themes of heroism and unexpected tragedy play out in subtle and clever ways. I think the critics who didn't like this movie are used to following very well paved roads with well defined markers. This movie follows its characters first to last and that can make it bumpy and twisty and ultimately, so much better. And because the characters are so three dimensional, the markers which we expect only come if the characters lead us there. They do in the end. The director lands us where we need to be. But along the way, we are on ground which is just as unsettled as the characters who turn to ridiculous methods to lessen the pain of losing someone they loved in their lives. If you're willing to walk this unsettled ground, it's well worth the ride. The performances are outstanding, especially Steve Coogan and Olivia Thirlby. If, on the other hand, you need to be spoon-fed or for your plots to be singular and instantly identifiable, you will probably hate it. You kind of have to give in to it and then the doors open and the characters and the overall tone of the film resonates. It WILL make you laugh and cry.

I saw this at a promotional screening. It was mostly filled with Hilary Duff fans. I am not one, but am much more so now. She does wonderfully well as the Lolita wannabe seductress. Again, the character is so finely drawn that some might think since she's not a successful seducer, the character and the movie leave you hanging. It's really the opposite. It's her lack of success which makes her character so compelling. In many ways you can say the same about the movie as a whole. It plays its own game according to the rules which govern human behavior, not conventional plot points. This results in an awkwardness which is much more real and much more satisfying than just about anything I've seen in some time. I highly recommend.",1245196800,16,2482,4.575280898876405

8350981,4,B0025B206O,"I stumbled across this one by chance (as opposed to pursuing it for Duff: I had no idea who Hillary Duff was prior to watching this). I enjoyed my first screening so much that I purchased What Goes Up (too bad it's not on Blu-ray) and watched it with a friend who is a director; he was bored and fiddling around with his phone in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle of the film he became engrossed, as I had. It's not one particular event that hooks you, just a buildup where you start to care about the fate of the characters, and a smattering of humor to help it along.

Duff did okay in her role as the jailbait character, but really it was the other actors who made the film come together. Although Steve Coogan was excellent, the MVPs of the film might actually have been Sarah Lind (as Peggy Popoladopolous) and Olivia Thirlby (as Tess). One of the most humorous moments I've ever seen in a film occurred with Sarah Lind's character Peggy when she is dropped into a very compromising situation thanks to the half-witted but forgivable character Fenster (played by Max Hoffman aka Woody Focker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-the-Fockers/dp/B00ECUAOWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet the Fockers</a>).

Whatever your level of experience as a film aficionado, you've probably not seen anything quite like this one. ()",1431043200,,1379,5.097345132743363

This movie reflects how some teenagers are n it has a lot of emotion in every scene added to it.

8350983,3,B0025B206O,"I liked this film, but it probably isn't for everybody.  There are a lot of little sub stories that might confuse some watchers and although it is rated R, I have seen much worse PG-13 films lately.  Steve Coogan plays a newspaper man with his own demons sent to home town of a female teacher who is going into space on the shuttle.  When he hits town after a few mishaps, he finds that a friend he had went to college with and who he had hoped could help him out has committed suicide.  Through this he finds himself entangled with a group of high school misfits and their problems.  Strange kids with strange problems prove entertaining.  The many sub plots keep you interested.",1401753600,,680,4.443548387096774

8350985,3,B0025B206O,"The title of my review might make it seem as though I was somewhat anxious for the end of the movie to arrive. In some ways, that is true. This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I honestly didn't find myself laughing at all. There were a few moments that made me consider laughing, but nothing really stood out as being funny. It definitely seemed like the exact opposite of a comedy. When I like a movie, I usually think to myself whether I'd want to watch that movie again someday or not. I didn't find myself answering yes to that for this movie. Am I saying the movie was bad in my opinion? No. It's just not a movie that I'd recommend my friends watch if they haven't already seen it. I would not recommend it to avid fans of Hilary Duff. So basically, to me, this was an okay movie--not great, but not terrible either.",1363392000,,829,4.220125786163522

8350987,4,B0025B206O,"'WHAT GOES UP must come down' and that seems to be one way of looking at this funky little film written by Robert Lawson and writer/director Jonathan Glatzer. Given Steve Coogan's comedic talents it is able to rise above an implausible script and come close to be entertaining.

The time frame is January 1986 and Campbell Babbitt (the last name is well chosen as a reference to Sinclair Lewis' novel 'Babbitt' - a satire of American culture, society, and behavior, it critiques the vacuity of middle-class American life and its pressure on individuals toward conformity) played by Steve Coogan is a reporter for New York World, writing a series about a woman who became a 'hero' by turning the anguish of seeing her son murdered in to acts of civil service (the woman whom Babbitt has grown to love commits suicide, and out of cherishing her memory he continues to write stories as though she were still alive - an act that Babbitt's editor Donna (Molly Price) finds ridiculous and sends Babbitt of to New Hampshire to cool off and to over the upcoming Space Shuttle Challenger).

Babbitt arrives in a little town in new Hampshire (the town is preparing to celebrate the Shutttle launch as Christa McAuliffe was raised there) to discover that his old friend Sam who was planning to become a priest but opted for teaching had a class of 'problem kids' who adored him. Babbitt discovers Sam's body in the street.  The class of odd kids mourn Sam's passing: he was their hero.  What Babbitt discovers is a group of kids each of whom is challenged with a problem and is trying to find ways to overcome those problems: Lucy Diamond  - a reference to the Beatles song - (Hillary Duff) was in love with Sam; Tess Sulivan (Olivia Thirlby) claims she saw Lucy and Sam in an intimate moment, suggesting that Sam's act resulted in his jumping off his roof in suicide (Tess has private problems at home that lead to an unwanted pregnancy); Jim (Josh Peck) is the guardian of the coffin and funeral and 'burial' of Sam; Peggy (Sarah Lind) is a paraplegic who talks Fenster (Max Hoffman, son of Dustin Hoffman) into being her first sexual encounter; Ann (Ingrid Nilson) and her 'twin' Sue (Andrea Brooks) provide comic relief in their bizarre antics; Lute (Laura Carswell) is the dissatisfied choral assistant to the weirdo-choir director and pageant designer Penelope Little (Molly Shannon).

In the midst of this strange crew and situation Babbitt as a reporter tries to sort every thing out, falls for Lucy, and is awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his woe begotten story in New York.  His influence helps the kids sort out their priorities and leads Babbitt to find a way out of his own unwanted heroism.  The story ends before we know the result of the Challenger explosion - and the creation of a real hero in Christa McAuliffe.  But there really isn't a beginning or an end to a story in the ordinary sense of a film.  WHAT GOES UP merely puts before the viewer the lives of some odd people and lets us watch how they cope.  It has a bit of comedy, though dark, and a lot of tender moments that don't come into focus until movies end.  For many this film will perplex: for others it will satisfy.  It is an offbeat tale with a lot of innuendoes.  Grady Harp, October 10",1285977600,5,3260,4.617647058823529
8350988,1,B0025B206O,"Honestly this should have re-edited and made into satire - it really has all the hallmarks. Kooky isn't comedy if you're just baffled, and we were.

Pretentious and so divorced from any sense of self it's Emo on Acid sensibilities may suit a number of people but we couldn't see the point at all.

The plot about a reporter whose life is on the skids, and goes to visit New Hampshire only to find more disasters waiting for him at the school he's visiting, is very weak. the characters are entirely one dimensional and the whole film takes forever to say or do anything.

Someone out there will love this - it will hit a chord with someone - but Steve Coogan used to make parodies of this sort of clap trap and really it tries way too hard to a cool oddity and we were just left bemused and bored - sorry.",1275264000,2,805,4.248366013071895
