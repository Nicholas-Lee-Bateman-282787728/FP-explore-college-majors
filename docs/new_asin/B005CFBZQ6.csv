4653023,5,B005CFBZQ6,"Anyone in for a weekend ""Hellraiser"" Marathon?  This is a great compilation of almost all of the Hellraiser franchise movies. Eventhough it does not include the first two classics and the latest movie, it is still a great collection to own for those die-hard Pinhead fans. So get out the popcorn and have your puzzle box ready for a great 6 movie marathon of horror and hell.",1336694400,,375,4.597014925373134
4653024,3,B005CFBZQ6,"Got this set at a grocery store for 5 bucks, and you can't beat that deal. Unfortunately what you get on this set are some of the worst Hellraiser films ever made. 3 and 4 are ok. 7 and 8 are terrible. Six has it's moments (mostly seeing Ashley Laurence on screen with Pinhead again), but 5 is the real gem in this collection. Scott (Emily Rose) Derrickson manages to bring new life to the Hellraiser series with Inferno, which is the third best entry behind 1 and 2. Image quality is pretty good on the discs, my only complaints are the fact that Hellraiser 3 is neither the uncut version of the film nor widescreen, and Hellraiser 4 has some audio issues (a weird echo on all of the soundFX and music tracks, that becomes really annoying). I noticed the same sound issues on the Halloween triple feature dvd release by Echo Bridge. But like I said, for the price it's a must have for any Hellraiser completest.",1327449600,,912,4.402366863905326
4653025,5,B005CFBZQ6,I just love me some Clive Barker. He is a true Horror Master and Pinhead is one of my faves and long with the creatures in Night Breed. I have seen the first two or three so I'm eager to see all of them together including the latest one. Just got the first two that came with blu-ray of the first in a very cool puzzle box. That box rocks. Ready for my soul to be torn apart.,1326412800,,375,3.8205128205128207
4653026,3,B005CFBZQ6,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the first three movies of this collection (Hell On Earth, Bloodline and Inferno) look great even with Hellraiser III being full screen.  The picture quality on the other movies in the set isn't too great, looking sometimes grainy and stretched.  This was truly saddening in the case of Hellseeker.  The audio seemed fine on all of the films.

This may just be a hang up for me, but I was bothered by the lack of subtitles for any of the films.",1325894400,17,477,4.511627906976744
4653027,5,B005CFBZQ6,"Here's what the world at large knows little about when it comes to Hellraiser:

1. It's based on Clive Barker's the Hellbound Heart Series
2. Pinhead's name was originally The Engineer, nice to see they changed it to that starting with the 5th film.
3. Starting with the 5th film and on, Hellraiser became what it was meant to be in the first place. Sure 1&2 are amazing films, but for TRUE fans the 5th one really starts the series.

You'd be surprised how little people actually know about Hellraiser. The leading theory is that the cenobite race as a whole was one of God's earlier experiments when trying to create mankind, which I feel lends a completely new aspect to the films themselves.. All in all, ""All problems solved""!",1322179200,6,731,4.615384615384615
4653028,3,B005CFBZQ6,"first off let me say with the exeption of hellworld these are all decent sequals. nobody expects sequals in a franchise to match up to the first (or in this cas the first and second) but as a horror movie fan i try to not to compare and just to enjoy the movies for what they are

Echo bridge did a fine job with 3-5 in terms of picture and sound, sure hell on earth is full screen but the movie is all there so it doesnt bother me. 4&5 both have great sound and picture

6-8 are not as great especialy 6(which is my favorite sequals along with 5)the picture appears to be stretched out, i have no idea what would posses them to do that but it dosen't look right and is very hard to focus.

7&8 are croped a little but not that bad

as for the discs themself disc 1 is double sided 3 and 4 on on side and 5 on the other
disc 2 is one sided all three movies out of order on one side just the movies for all no special features like alot of people like to have

as for the movies themselves i would rate them as the following(on a scale from 1 to 5

Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth- 3

Hellraiser IV: Bloodline- 3

Hellraiser: Inferno - 3.5

Hellraiser: Hellseeker- 4

Hellraiser: Deader- 2.5

Hellraiser: Hellworld- 2

4653039,1,B005CFBZQ6,I give this product no stars it states 6 Hellraiser movies but it only has four and the other disk is different. That different disk is missing two of the movies on one disc I will not buy anything such as that again from this provider.,1521244800,,236,4.1521739130434785

4653041,5,B005CFBZQ6,"I am very, very happy with this set. Little bummed that there is no special features, but I got what I paid for. Which is  The less popular of the sequels for about 8 dollars and they're in HD they're on blue ray they look fabulous they may not be that great but they're still part of What are my favorite horror series and veins of the genre! So I am very glad that I got it. The one thing I will say is that it has nothing to do with the product it just has to do with the people who put the disc together is. There are no subtitles or captions available for somebody who has a slight hearing loss, so I do like to have those subtitles or captions, one plus, if I'm watching it late at night, I don't want to wake up people. That option is not available because like I said it is very minimal as far as what is on blue ray.

Other than that, everything is fabulous. I plan to get hellraiser and hellbound hellraiser 2. A long with hellraiser judgment and how is a revelation on blue ray at the beginning of the month to complete Michael action as far as blue rays go and I purchased hellraiser deader aka 7 digitally in HD. Because there is no blue ray of that that was one thing that kind of caught me off guard with this set. Is it went 4, 5,6 and 8. I figured that with the way that the films were released coma that a blue right probably would have been 5, 6 coma, 7, and 8. Since revelations and judgment are already on blue race separately. And 3 and 4 are officially Miramax\ Dimension Films to me, I just talked to release was a little odd like maybe they should have put there on one blue ray tore on another. And then they were had the other 2 to bank a little bit more money off of something like that. I don't know cocomment. Because why not have part 7 on the set? When it's not, that's not even available to buy in HD other than digitally, and to be honest, that's my favorite other than hell seeker of the direct to DVD video releases.",1521072000,,1952,4.041343669250646

Also keep in mind, this is not the first second or third of this franchise, this is a collection of something like IV, V, VII, and VIII. why they so randomly picked these sequels I don't know.

Hellraiser 3 which is listed on the box as widescreen presentation (rectangle) is actually fullscreen  (square). I would not recommend watching it because it not of best quality.

Despite all of this, I still purchased the two-disc collection. I'm fine with it because I'd rather purchase the Blu-Ray versions of the first two movies. But one thing I wish I had known is this: there are no subtitles for any of the films. For horror addicts who are hearing impaired, this is a big disappointment.

I bought the set anyway since I wanted to see part three again.

This Blu-ray HELLRAISER COLLECTION includes Four films from the HELLRAISER franchise which includes:

HELLRAISER IV: Bloodline [1996] Three generations of the same family deal with the consequences of unleashing the forces of hell. In 18th-century France, Paul L'Merchant [Bruce Ramsay] works as a toymaker until he's coerced into creating a box that serves as a portal between hell and Earth. The box summons demonic Angelique [Valentina Vargas] and Pinhead [Doug Bradley], who 200 years later hunt down John Merchant [Bruce Ramsay]. Then, centuries later, Phillip Merchant [Bruce Ramsay] prepares for a final confrontation.

HELLRAISER V: Inferno [2000] Joseph Thorne [Craig Sheffer] is an intelligent yet corrupt Los Angeles detective police detective who regularly indulges in drug use and infidelity during the course of duty. At the scene of what appears to be a ritual murder, Joseph Thorne discovers a strange puzzle box, which he takes home in order to indulge his fascination with puzzles. After solving the box, Thorne begins to experience bizarre hallucinations, such as being seduced by a pair of mutilated women and being chased by a creature with no eyes or legs. His only means of leaving is with Pinhead's [Doug Bradley] puzzle box.

HELLRAISER VI: Hellseeker [2002] Pinhead [Doug Bradley] and his demons terrorise a man [Dean Winters] after surviving a car accident that apparently kills his wife Kirsty Cotton-Gooden [Ashley Laurence] when their car plunges off a bridge into the river below. Trevor manages to escape with his life, but even though police divers find both car doors open there is no sign of Kirsty.

HELLRAISER VIII: Hellworld [2005] The film introduces a circle of youths who are addicted to playing Hellworld, an online computer game based on the HELLRAISER series. The film opens at the funeral of Adam, one of the friends who was obsessed with the game and ultimately committed suicide after becoming too immersed in the game. The remaining five friends blame themselves for not having prevented Adam's suicide.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: HELLRAISER IV: Bloodline [1996] In the year 2127, Dr. Paul Merchant [Bruce Ramsay] has illegally commandeered the space station he designed, Space Station Minos, and sent its entire crew away in life pods. A team of soldiers arrives and successfully retakes the station, Merchant too occupied with other matters to offer much resistance. In captivity, Merchant is debriefed by female soldier Rimmer [Christine Harnos]. His explanation of why he had to commandeer the station is an unusual one, to say the least. Merchant's tale begins in France in the late 1700s. His ancestor, a toymaker named Phillip Le Marchand (play also by Ramsay), is commissioned by a wealthy patron, Duc De L'isle [Mickey Cottrell] to create a familiar looking puzzle box that fans by now known as the Lament Configuration. When Le Marchand arrives to deliver his commission and collect his fee, he inadvertently witnesses De L'Isle and his young assistant Jacque [Adam Scott] sacrificing a young woman, Angelique (Valentina Vargas). They skin her corpse and conjure a demon that uses her skin as a faade while under De L'Isle's control. Jacque and the demonic Angelique betray De L'isle and Le Marchand is killed while trying to recover the box from De L'Isle's estate. Concluding his story in the 22nd century, Dr. Merchant reveals that the space station he designed is the realization of his family's legacy: a giant device inspired by the Lament Configuration and designed to capture and concentrate light in the hope that it can be used to burn Pinhead and his minions away forever.

HELLRAISER V: Inferno [2000] This film plays like a cross between Bad Lieutenant and Jacob's Ladder and is my kind of cop: he does drugs, indulges himself with prostitutes, totally ignores his wife and child and backstabs his partner and he is looking for redemption (aka Bad Lieutenant) and that salvation is finding this missing child. Once he opens the ""Lament Configuration"" karma kicks in hard. He's plunged into a confusing world of demons, gore and weirdness. Joseph Thorne [Craig Sheffer] is forced to face his own demons...and it's not pleasant. Craig Sheffer eventually won me over. I will admit that at first I felt his performance was awkward but as the film moved on I grew to like him, the film is on his shoulders. Nicholas Turturro is on automatic pilot playing a cop...again. James Remar does what he has to do...not much. Doug Bradley shows up to collect his check, Pinhead has nothing to do with this film. All of the female parts are too underwritten to mention. The film does feel familiar. This terrain has been walked on before: `Angel Heart,' `The 9th Gate,' `Jacob's Ladder' even `Seven.' But if you like that genre (I loved it) I wouldn't see why you wouldn't appreciate this one. There's enough morbid imagery here to satisfy the ""Goth"" in all of us, enough gore to quench the thirst but not enough Pinhead to call this a Hellraiser flick.

HELLRAISER VI: Hellseeker [2002] A shady businessman attempts to piece together the details of the car crash that killed his wife and rendered him an amnesiac and left him in possession of a sinister puzzle box that summons monsters. Directed by Hellraiser regular Rick Bota comes another odd entry into the Cenobium-driven franchise. This time it wears the more promising flag of returning star Ashley Laurence reprising her role as Kirsty Cotton. We get a hint of this thru dialog later but not to the point of referencing ""too"" much from the original Hellraiser films she appeared in. (We learn that Kirsty lost her dad to mysterious circumstances when she was youner...aka plucked away by cenobites). Taking a cue from once again the `Jacobs Ladder' approach, this particular entry is a bit weirder than others. We've seem to have gotten into his cycle where Hell and Cenobites are like Twilight zone players only taunting at their victims as they experience a barrage of nightmarish circumstances. But adding to that further...it follows this Jacobs Ladder-style that presents as their current lives with a few odd things stuck between. To add to the visuals, we get a brief encounter with a few Joel Peter Witkin inspired scenes, but nothing too elaborate, just a prop here and there inspire by his photographs. Cenobites this round I assume were introduced on a limited budget as while we get to see a few new demons, they are only brief and uneventful. Doug Bradley as Pinhead is unflawed as usual. You have to love his lines and his character's ability to disregard the human condition always answering in a riddle sermon-sort-of response. It's the meat that holds his character together and paints him as a cold bastard of a demon. HELLRAISER VI: Hellseeker [2002] is worth checking out, though as mentioned, there is not much cenobite action to partake in. Maybe the routine of only revealing them in small portions is what fans want.

HELLRAISER VIII: Hellworld [2005] A group of Hellworld fans (an online Hellraiser video game) go to a Hellworld shin-dig, see the macabre sights. HELLRAISER VIII: Hellworld had its game on and then some! It established its surprisingly not very likeable nerdy teen idiots, and it is a type of groovy William Castle-esque premise, loosely referenced the Hellraiser mythos along the way, and of course we have the token Lance Henriksen for that touch of oh so important class and then lets with typical hardcore! What follows is a highly amusing, shameless and well-paced horror rollercoaster ride.

Blu-ray Video Quality  HELLRAISER IV: Bloodline [1996] The fourth film in the series doesn't look too bad in its original 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio. The 1080p transfer is very dark, the norm for the franchise, and it does show off some heavy film grain andnoise. However, detail levels were decent enough and the colour array, when we do get to the lighter scenes, weren't bad.

Blu-ray Video Quality  HELLRAISER V: Inferno [2000] The next one in line, Hellraiser V for those keeping track, looks considerable worse as it's also the first of the numerous direct-to-video sequels. This time the video, 1080i HD, shows off a ton of pixilation and the black levels are OK but all around it's an average transfer. I should note that there is quite a bit dust and scratches so it doesn't appear, not surprisingly, that the studio did any work with the transfer.

Blu-ray Video Quality  HELLRAISER VI: Hellseeker [2002] Hellraiser VI looks a bit better but not much. The 1080p transfer shows off some decent detail level but nothing special. I didn't notice as much in regards to flaws but on occasion there will be some scratches or dust marks.

Blu-ray Video Quality  HELLRAISER VIII: Hellworld [2005] And the last of the bunch on this set doesn't look too bad but suffers much of the same flaws of its predecessors. Here, the 1080p high-definition transfer at times looks alright, even half-decent, but in some scenes, especially the oddly lit ones, I noticed quite a bit artifacting as the scenes/shots don't look very smooth.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  HELLRAISER IV: Bloodline, HELLRAISER V: Inferno, HELLRAISER VI: Hellseeker has been given a really good substantial 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio surround tracks and while none of them are particularly special, they get the job done with clear dialogue levels and some audio effects for the action sequences is audible. HELLRAISER VIII: Hellworld being the newer film in this franchise set, has a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and is on par with the other 3 films that are much better than the others and that there is some substantial audio surround coming via the rear channels.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The disc only has a menu to select the 4 films. The film will start playing during which you can use the pop-up button to get to the chapter menu or go to another film. Otherwise, there are no features for any of the films.

Finally, overall, the MIRAMAX 4-film set of HELLRAISER sequels is sadly barebones in terms of special features, but I guess if you're a fan of this franchise, I think the audio and video transfers are a step up from their inferior DVD counterparts. At a brilliant low price, and it's also not a bad deal, but know you're not going to get anything special, but despite this, I am pleased to add this to my ever increasing HELLRAISER Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

4653182,3,B005CFBZQ6,"We get 6 Hellraiser films on DVD (Parts III to VIII). Some are wide-screen and others are full-screen. There are no special features from the stand-alone versions.

Hell on Earth is great until the second half. Pinhead tries to take over the world.
Bloodline is an outer space adventure with Pinhead and much emphasis on the puzzle box.
Inferno is a bland direct to video movie that is gaining popularity with fans.
Hellseeker is considered slightly better than Inferno by some horror freaks.
Deader features a journalist trying to solve the mystery of the Cenobites.
Hellworld features Lance Henriksen scaring some gamers. All I can say is that it's better than Hellraiser: Resurrection (sold separately).

This is the best Hellraiser collection available in North America on DVD or Blu-ray despite its imperfections. The real advantage is that the price is right. There is also an overrated Hellraiser Puzzle Box (DVD) with the superior first two films but it is way overpriced. Hellraiser III has never seen a Blu-ray release but is included here. There is a Hellraiser Blu-ray 4-pack which offers little because the video and audio look the same as in this set and no extras are added either. The Hellraiser Complete Collection 1-9: 25th Anniversary Edition Box Set (DVD) is only available in Europe so this is the best we can do for now. The most recent Hellraiser (Revelations) is not included (it is terrible and should be skipped).",1377302400,,1439,4.966804979253112

But not here from the third to the eight, it is all terrible.  From the acting to the plot to the scenes it is a complete boredom of dumb dialogues and bad actors who have no business acting and most look like extracts in porn movies. It's as bad as all the children of the corn follow ups and Friday the 13 and nightmare in elm street and Texas chainsaw massacre. All these movies have great sequels but they seem to lose their touch in the third try so yeah don't bother with this sewer of horrific bad movies.",1376870400,,662,4.171875

Most of the movies after pt 3 weren't that great but if your a collector like I am, you cant beat the price I got mine under 10 bucks including the shipping.  As far as a review for each movie goes...
pt 2 and 3 were awesome..pt 4....was okay 5 and 6 sucked and part 7 didn't suck as bad as 5,6. But its still worth it for part 2 and part 3 and part 4 which seemed to follow the original story line, before it went fan sub. writting style.",1353196800,,573,3.775
