3599049,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Kristin Scott Thomas is amazing in this utterly fascinating movie about two sisters Juliette played by Kristen and Lea, a part made for the understated Elsa Zylberstein who have to get to know each other all over again after 15 years apart.

Juliette has been in prison, she murdered her six year old son Pierre and since his death she has not spoken of him but what she did caused her family to turn against her, other than her younger sister Lea who wants to mend bridges and make up for lost time.

However her time in prison has left Juliette in limbo, she is now a silent and self contained woman who no one at first can touch her, not even her younger sister Lea who has offered her a home much to the consternation of her husband Luc who worries about his two adopted daughters and his mute father, an enigmatic man who has suffered a series of strokes and now can no longer speak but he still can read and is much loved by all the family.

Juliette's slow emergence from her imprisonment, both physical and mental is a painful transition for everyone, from her wary brother-in-law, to her niece P'tit Lys who has a child's guile and understanding of human nature without even knowing it.

There is some genuine humour in the movie, like when Juliette sleeps with a man she meets in a bar and is dismissive of his sexual prowess, but best of all is the tense moment when she tells everyone at a dinner table she has been in prison for 15 years for murder, everyone but her sister, brother-in-law and a friend of her sister's roar with laughter, thinking she is being droll and sarcastic.  Michel, played by the excellent, Laurent Grvill is Juliette's sister friend who forms a romantic attachment to Juliette for he alone understands what Juliette is going through and bit by bit we begin to understand why Juliette committed such a horrific crime.

This is not a sentimental film, but it is beautifully crafted and very human, and this makes it all the watchable.

Not everyone likes subtitles but I am glad they did not dub this particular film as it would have detracted from the film's nuance and beauty.  Be prepared for an emotive ending that leaves you surprisingly satisfied as the two sisters finally let each other know how much they love each other and how a seemingly wanton act of violence actually was a powerful act of love.",1222560000,9,2346,4.529550827423168

There is a turning point at the end but almost unnoticeable since it appeared so slow.
I understand the concept and I do understand the main charactor's pain but I still don't understand her being silent about what she have done to her daughter and went to jail.
Kristin Scott Thomas seems to be a nice actress but her real acting doesn't seemed to be shown 100% in this movie and I personally think that it's the director's fault. So I cannot give it a 5 star.

Without hesitation I purchased it since the title touched me as if you would fall in love at the first sight with someone you never met before. Kristin performed so well in this movie. A single gesture,a shine of her eyes,and even a little shiver of her ear at the ending would make you keep in heart. What we call love is that onething can change your life. True love will lead in warmness and brilliance instead of coldness and gloom. Like Juliette,everybody has the same experience wandering in the streets,feeling dazed and confused. Family support is important to rebuild confidence. Elza Zylberstein also did a perfect job in the movie. Her sweet smile was in harmony with the beautiful scenery of Nancy city. In English Language Version Thomas dubs for the role in her own voice and she's really excellent. Namely,it's a 25GB Blu-ray Disc with both English and French audio.

3599246,5,B001GCUO6Q,"I'll start by talking about what I see as the most important weakness of the film, which comes at the end. Though I reveal information that the film reserves until the end, I don't really think this is a spoiler, as I don't believe this is crucial to an appreciation of the film.
The story about what actually happened to Juliette's son told by Juliette at the end is simply not credible given all the other things we know about what happened to her during her trial, sentencing, and subsequent imprisonment. She gave the lethal injection to her son when he was already so sick that he could barely move. In such circumstances, it is simply impossible that, despite her silence during the trial, her son's sickness would have remained unknown and her own motives opaque to her family and the judge, resulting in ostracism and a 15-year prison sentence. I got the feeling this unconvincing story was adopted by the screenplay writer in order to maximize the viewer's sympathy with Juliette: she relieved her son of his immense suffering. It would have been much more believable, but possibly less easy to swallow for many viewers, if she had administered the lethal injection immediately after making her diagnosis. In this way the boy's illness would have remained a secret and Juliette's motives sufficiently unclear for her family and the judge to consider her a cold-blooded murderess.
I have given this film five stars in spite of this because I don't think this is really what the film is about. The film is about the love between the two sisters, and in particular the love shown by the younger sister to the returning Juliette. It is about the healing that is made possible by that love. And therein lies the power of the film.

Kristin Scott, usually good, gives the performance of a lifetime and her co-actress lead complements her perfectly.  This is rarified air in the movie bussiness.  Without car chases, explosions, or special effects of any kind that I could detect, this film runs away with the best picture I've seen in the last 5 years.  It's the best picture you've never heard of.  I won't spoil anything by telling you anything about the plot, save to say the ending pulls it all together.

3599286,5,B001GCUO6Q,"As much as I love Kate Winslet, Kristin Scott Thomas should have won the oscar for best actress for her role as Juilette in this movie. Ms. Thomas underplays the role through most of the movie and then when she finally does show emotions you as the viewer feel them along with her. The most powerful scene in the movie is between her and her sister, played beautifully by Elsa Zylberstein, I will not go into detail and spoil it but, that scene alone in my opinion should have gotten her the oscar. This is an incredible film but be warned this is not a ""pick me up"" movie but it is worth the watch!",1362096000,,599,4.217391304347826
3599287,5,B001GCUO6Q,"This is a masterpiece, in which Kristin Scott Thomas held me in a spell of sympathy, fear, hope,and mystery. Her body and face are half-collapsed, half despairing even without a word being spoken. She is so withdrawn and unforthcoming that it renders us as suspicious, fearful, and even as untrusting as the characters who look sideways at Juliette.  Has she given up completely? Her eyes are almost blank, in fact she is trying to see what we see so easily.  We never quite see or know what she is thinking, and this engenders in us an unresolvable precariousness --- which Juliette must feel always, even when this story comes to an end.  If none of this makes sense, watch this movie.  I held my breath throughout.  All the characters are well-played, and Elsa Zylberstein as Juliette's younger sister Lea is a fabulous foil.  I am in awe of Scott-Thomas after seeing this performance; she conveys more in turning her head just once than many Hollywood stars can produce in two hours of histrionics.  Cliches like 'riveting' are not cliches for this movie.  Wonderful.  Now I am trying to breathe again.",1359417600,,1106,4.778947368421052

I admit at one point I was about ready to give up on it, but then it picked up and sparked my interest. Although it is in French, the subtitles were easy to follow. Not aggravating like some have been. I agree too that the performances were very good, and it was not hard to have sympathy for these sisters.

3599332,4,B001GCUO6Q,"This is a very adult film. I also agree that watching it alone, is hard. You want to talk about the film with someone for sure!!!",1339027200,,129,4.0
3599333,3,B001GCUO6Q,"In spite of significant credibility issues, I enjoyed the movie and have seen it several times. Perhaps I should have watched it only once and left it at that. Even a truly stellar performance by Kristin Scott-Thomas (Juliette) struggles to rise above the shakiness of the storyline. The very idea that the release of a doctor from prison fifeen years after murdering her own child for unknown reasons that were not uncovered during the trial (!!!  -conversations between characters make it clear that they have no clue about the circumstances of the crime)and that the whole affair would not garner substantial media attention is hugely problematic.

Specifically, we are to believe that Juliette presumably kept her child's terminal illness a complete secret and no one, including her parents or society at large, had any clue about the circumstances. Surely during the trial all the facts would have come out and given the nature of the crime, would likely have received a lot of publicity.

No matter how well shielded her younger sister Lea may have been from the situation in her youth, it makes no sense that she would not have been aware of the circumstances, and even less sense that as an adult with a PhD, a college professor and researcher, she ""didn't try to understand"" her sister's motivation before making the all important decision not to give birth to her own children, choosing instead to adopt -- presumably out of fear that she would one day feel the urge to murder her child too.

Lea's character becomes even harder to understand when we see that she welcomes her sister after fifteen years with open arms, knowing only that she killed her son without knowing why, despite the fact that she has two small children at home. If she assumes her sister murdered her child for no reason whatsoever, why would she feel comfortable with this? And her husband clearly has issues with Juliette early on - yelling at his wife when she confesses she asked Juliette to babysit one night. ""She killed her kid and you asked her!?"" he shouts. With that kind of attitude it seems unlikely he would have accepted her into his home in the first place.

Juliette's character is even more difficult to understand if she told absolutely no one during her son's life that her child is ill, and that, as a doctor, she ""did all the tests herself"". So much for second opinions! The idea that everyone was ignorant of the illness and actual nature of the ""murder"", and that Juliette would simply keep all this to herself and be content to be perceived as a murderer is tough to swallow. And if that unlikely scenario were indeed the case, her willigness to live out her life as a self-pitying, miserable victim of tragedy become increasingly irritating throughout the film.

There are other issues here and there that further impair the credibility, such as a letter Lea finds supposedly written by Juliette's six year old child before his death, prose that no six year old, unless he was a genius, could have possibly written.

Don't think about any of these issues when you are watching the film and the story works. But contemplate the plot in any depth and it all seems to unravel fairly quickly.",1336694400,2,3197,4.759927797833935
3599334,5,B001GCUO6Q,"""I've Loved You So Long"" is a French-language movie that stars Kristin Scott Thomas as a woman haunted by her past. Having served prison time for 15 years for murder, Juliette Fontaine is released on parole and goes to live with her younger sister, Lea [Elsa Zylberstein] who was only a teenager when Juliette was sent to prison. Juliette finds it awkward reconnecting with people, and it's especially hard as Lea is married and has two adopted Vietnamese daughters, and a father-in-law who is recovering from a stroke. Things are made more difficult by Lea's husband Michel who can't reconcile with Juliette's living with them, considering the crime she committed. I won't give too much of the plot away, as this is a movie that unfolds slowly and rewards the patient viewer with all the necessary information in good time.

The plot may seem slow in revealing the details one wishes to know, such as the unspeakable crime Juliette has committed and why she is such a tormented, distant soul, but this actually worked for me as Juliette's character is fully- developed here and the viewer is rewarded with one of the most poignant and nuanced performance by an actress. Kristin Scott-Thomas is remarkable in this movie, and her French is excellent [there is also an English audio option in which she actually does the dubbing for her part]. Her portrayal of a fragile and tormented woman who is haunted by her past and struggling to go on with her life on a daily basis is nothing short of amazing. She truly deserved the Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Elsa Zylberstein is also very credible as lea, Juliette's compassionate younger sister who tries her best to penetrate the wall of silence Juliette has erected around her. The supporting cast also does a good job - the tortured parole officer who pines for his ex-wife and kids, the college lecturer who is romantically interested in Juliette and a few others - I thought the cast did a credible job in holding the film together and elevating it above another melodrama.

This is a depressing movie and definitely one that leaves you pondering on many important life issues - choices, regrets, relationships and many more. But, I feel more enlightened for having watched it, and would recommend it to anyone who is keen on human dramas with substance.",1325980800,,2319,4.838790931989925
3599335,5,B001GCUO6Q,"This film portrays a non-sensational take on a parolee's first month or so out of prison - she has to adjust and find a job, find her place with her family (sister, brother-in-law and kids) and really find her place in her sister's heart and her friends. It does move a bit slowly at times, but is very well acted and believable. You never know how you will react or respond until you're actually in a particular situation.

I love that this film has an English actress in it - I was amazed at her fluency and ease in this film.  Everything is so subtle and nuanced - this is one of the things I like best about this type of French film.

I would definitely say that this is a chick flick:  it's subtle, nuanced, emotional, sensitive - a great film to watch with girlfriends or your sister.",1316563200,,790,4.281879194630872

3599337,4,B001GCUO6Q,"What an intricate story.  This one unfolds a bit slowly for some tastes, but I enjoy action as well as drama.  I don't understand any French, and that's the primary language in this film.  Fortunately, my version is also dubbed in English.  I found it at the local supermarket.  At the risk of being a spoiler, there's a key moment in the film where the younger sister discovers a lab report page which her older sister keeps with her always.  It reveals test results for her child whom she killed.  (Not an accident, but I could have used a little less beating around the bush to get this out!)

I don't read French, but who can read Doctor's writing anyways.  It's easy to overlook that the top of the list mentions leukocytes (unbalanced).  So we can infer early onset childhood leukemia was an issue which no one ever actually ( actually NEVER) comes out and says!

A tragedy in slow motion. Much of the worst has happened in the past, over 15 years ago. Kristin Scott Thomas' character Juliette has spent 15 years in prison for something that she definitely did do. It takes until the end of the film to understand what exactly she did and why. And I will not tell you.
After her release, she begins to live with her sister and sister's family, while she tries to find a job. Reintegration is hard. She is a harsh person. She melts slowly, step by step.
A brilliant movie with an outstanding performance by KST.

3599380,5,B001GCUO6Q,"After a harsh sentence of 15 years in prison for a crime she certainly did commit, Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas) is released to live with her sister, Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) and slowly comes to life again.  Her sister's love and Juliette's growing affection for Lea's two adopted girls are the main means for that resurrection.  Why she spent so long in prison is revealed only in the last fifteen minutes or so and fairly arbitrarily at that, but is pretty clear from very early in the film.  Since this is a redemption saga and a character study, that forced reveal detracts not at all from the film's moving power.  Scott Thomas is outstanding and Zylberstein, a real beauty, never wavers in her determination to bring her sister back into human society.  A clutch of supporting actors are nearly as good.

3599381,5,B001GCUO6Q,"This is such a good film. It is intelligent, with a script that slowly reveals secrets one at a time at a pace that keeps the viewer glued to the screen. It is well acted, with Kristin Scott Thomas demonstrating not only incredible acting skills but the ability to hold an entire film together with the power of her portrayal of a hurt woman, full of secrets and pain. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a woman released from prison after 15 years, and she is so full of pain, misery, and guilt that it is almost painful to watch her. She moves in with her sister and brother-in-law and gradually comes back into the world of the living, step by painful step, as the viewer puts together the pieces of her past life and her crime, step by painful step. I don't mean to make the film sound dreadful, it is not, but the film expects the viewer to be intelligent, patient, and resilient in the face of another's anguish. Gradually people come into the life of Juliette Fontaine and her social circle expands. Juliette has a younger sister who missed her and loved her and it is the courage to heal displayed in this younger sister that also is a fine attribute of the film. This is excellent film-making. The direction was subtle and was perfectly balanced between revealing the underlying secrets in the heart of Juliette balanced with the sticks and stones of everyday life. It is excellent storytelling.",1299369600,2,1395,4.584
3599382,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Kristen Scott Thomas is Juliette, coming to live with her sister and family after 15 years in prison. Lea, her much younger sister played by Elsa Zylberstein, is a literature professor with a soccer-fanatic husband and two young adopted Vietnamese children, and they live comfortably in an unnamed medium-sized French city. The film very elegantly and naturally unfolds Juliettes past and what her crime was, building to an emotionally wrenching conclusion that I will not spoil for anyone who might be interested in seeing this - and anyone with the slightest interest in honest, personal and emotional film-making should certainly consider it.

One of the nicest aspects of the film is its portrayal of city living, as lived in by educated, intellectual types - this is a very far cry from the typical American suburbiana or even the New York and LA of most Hollywood films, a place of bookstores and cafs and people who actually walk and interact with each other in public - which is an element that is pretty difficult for Juliette to get a handle on after 15 years in isolation.  Having been a big-city dweller myself - as well as a loner - for much of my life, this element in the film feels very real and accurate to me; the loneliness in the midst of life theme is something that was popular at one time (60s and 70s) in American cinema, but not so much anymore; it's good that the French still are interested in showing it.

Scott Thomas gives on of the best performances I have seen in the last five years, and Zylberstein is not far behind - this is one of the best portrayals of sisterly love I have seen and a really powerful portrait of the difficulties a person faces after a harrowing past - even when surrounded for the most part by love and understanding.

Using the main character's perspective, we view one world full of joy and another full of sorrow and tragedy -- as played out in the lonely lives of two supporting characters struggling to make sense of the tragedies in their own lives (one through divorce and the other whose wife was taken by an automobile accident).

3599400,4,B001GCUO6Q,"Kristin Scott Thomas is best known for her Oscar-nominated performance in ""The English Patient,"" but a considerable number of her films are made in Frence, so it comes as no surprise that she is Csar-nominated in 2009 for her superb acting as Juliette in ""I've Loved You So Long"" (""Il y a longtemps que je t'aime""). In this stirring French drama she plays a woman who has just been released after serving fifteen years in prison.

In the opening scene we meet Juliette, sitting alone in the airport caf, nervously waiting for somebody. There appears her younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein), who hasn't seen her more than fifteen years. The film follows the emotional process of Juliette and people surrounding her, including Lea's husband Luc (Serge Hazanavicius), who does not necessarily welcome her stay, quite Michel (Laurent Grvill), who is attracted to Juliette, and Capitaine Faur, always speaking of his dream of traveling down the Orinoco River.

Though its subject matter is serious, ""I've Loved You So Long"" is not a depressing film. The film is slow-paced and requires patience, but acting is unanimously great. Sometimes ""I've Loved You So Long"" feels like a stage production, with ""acts"" and ""scenes,"" but this does not mean the film is wordy or stagey.

First-time feature director Philippe Claudel, formerly known as novelist, often makes much use of the actors' physical expressions. In fact Juliette and Lea really emote. It is emotional torrent unleashed, though I am more impressed with their quieter moments. Another notable point is that the film doesn't explain much about what is going on now, or what really happened fifteen years ago. The storyline, which by itself is pretty simple, is a little melodramatic, but the film is not burdened with long expository dialogues.

""I've Loved You So Long"" may not your cup of tea. Some viewers would find its understated and slow narrative intriguing while others may think differently. Whatever your reaction may be, you will be fascinated with the strong performance of Kristin Scott Thomas.",1269993600,2,2062,5.091715976331361
3599401,4,B001GCUO6Q,"I had heard a lot of mixed reviews on `Il y a Longtemps Que je T'aime', and so going in all I really expected to love was Kristin Scott Thomas (because there was no mixed review there, everyone said she was phenomenal).  I was pleasantly surprised, for while there were aspects of the film I wish had been worked out differently, this movie actually proved to be far better than I initially expected.

I'll yell ""SPOILERS"" here (minor)...

The film tells the unsettling story of a woman named Juliette, who, after spending 15 years in prison for murdering her 6-year-old son, is released into the world and has to rehabilitate.  She moves in with her sister, who she's never spoken to since her arrest.  Her family had disowned her and she has no knowledge of their life now.  Her sister, Lea, is married and has two adopted Vietnamese children.  She lives with her husband and his father.  Her husband, Luc, is apprehensive about Juliette.  The thing is, everyone knows what she's done but no one knows why she did it, and so that lingering question haunts everyone's interactions with Juliette.

The film does try to do a lot in a short time.  The film is not even two hours (close) but it tries to broach all aspects of Juliette's rehabilitation, which can come off feelings a bit stuffed in parts.  I wish that more time was spent on each aspect of her life.  You have her dealing with family, with work and with a new love interest, let alone her grappling with her crime.  It's a lot of fully flesh out, and I don't know if the film does all that it needed to in that regard.  I also have an issue with the ending.  You spend the whole film aching for an answer to that haunting question, and when you get it you (or at least `I') find it rather predictable and unrewarding.  Not that anything would be `rewarding' in this case, but I would have preferred `no answer' to `this answer'.

Performance wise, Kristin Scott Thomas is a revelation.

Really, she literally blew me away.  First off, she looks aged, slightly bloated and very, very tired.  Yes, makeup has something to do with that, but her aura is very much defeated, which only aids in her expressions.  The way she flirts with words is stunning, her mind forming thoughts that her mouth refuses to speak.  Her sharp outbursts are sudden, unexpected and wholly believable.  Her near bitter resentment is understandable and haunting.  Her grief is undeniable.  You feel everything she feels, and you understand why.  Even in her breakdown at the end, where the `reveal' is made (the one that I didn't like), she completely sells it, never once going `too far' in her dramatics.

She is simple flawless.

The rest of the cast is serviceable, some better than others.  I thought that Frederic Pierrot was sensational (his character turn still plagues me) and I liked what Laurent Grevill did with his sadly underwritten character (this film needed to be at least another thirty minutes in length...maybe even another hour).  Personally, I felt that Elsa Zylberstein and Serge Hazanavicius made very little out of their GOLDMINE characters.  I understand that the script didn't write in a lot for them to do (again, this film should have been longer in order to cover much more) but she seemed almost afraid to really embrace their characters, and when Elsa did `reach' she came across as almost fake.

In the end, I have to say I was very pleased.  It could have been better, but it is far better than I expected.  All that you've heard about Thomas here is correct.  She is utterly outstanding.  2008 was a banner year for Leading Actresses (even if the Academy's ballot included Streep's hamming and Jolie's screaming).  Between Winslet, Williams, Hawkins, Janssen, Hathaway and Thomas, I struggle to decide just WHO was the best.

Let's call it a six-way tie!",1269561600,,3825,4.686186186186186
3599402,4,B001GCUO6Q,"As others have written, the acting was brilliant.  I was lucky because I reserved this DVD at my local library and forgot why until I started watching. Ideally people will watch this film without reading any reviews. So be warned! And I do talk about the ending.

The plot premise is intriguing. A woman is released from prison after 15 years. She moves in temporarily with her sister's loving family. On one level, the movie shows how hard it an be for prisoners to return to society even with a strong support system. It also shows how painful stereoypes can be. As soon as people hear that she was convicted of murder, they block out everything else.

I was totally captivated by the story, but even during the film, I had some nagging doubts. After 15 years in prison, I would expect the heroine to be dazed. But although her face seems lined and she looks tired, she doesn't seem to have trouble adjusting to life ""outside,"" beyond a few skirmishes that would occur with anyone who moves in with in-laws. Her hair is healthy and nicely cut. She holds her own at a dinner party that I, for one, would find exhausting.

I also share the questions raised by other reviewers. Somewhere along the movie, I began to wonder if something was amiss. Was she covering up for the real murderer? Would we discover the murderer never happened?

From what I've read, some people do feel horrendous guilt and even want to go to prison, as the heroine said. We aren't told the name of the illness the child had. But I would expect an autopsy would reveal the child's illness and then would raise questions about why she killed him. I can imagine this woman saying nothing at first, as a strong emotional reaction. Surely she would have had some kind of treatment in prison. She would have been vilifed by the other prisoners, many of whom were mothers.

So bottom line, I can't imagine that the circumstances of the death would be kept hidden. I can see why the heroine would feel an irrational sense of guilt and a desire to keep silent but I don't see how she could. Anyway, it seems that other doctors would have pointed out that she didn't have to confess to murder. She could find a way to administer an overdose of pain medicine, once the child began to show symptoms. Ultimately it's a brilliant psychological study based on an improbable premise.",1267833600,,2343,4.553444180522566

3599404,4,B001GCUO6Q,"""First Principle: Do no harm"". That ancient dictum included siblings and parents, one would think.
The script has voids large enough to have flown and landed a Concorde...
Postmortem for the homicide, lacking in the script, consigns this storyline to a back alley's rusty blade. A medical examiner should have been consulted at some point in the creation of the screenplay. Additionally, the kid's father had taken, presumably, pathology in med school before quitting. He was oblivious to his son's condition or emerging signs and symptoms? How did he get into med school with that intellect? Was his understanding of his wife so superficial after 7+ years together that he testifies against her? Her parents were clueless?
Juliette wished to be punished for a genetic(?)/metabolic defect she was unaware of?

It would have been novel to see a social worker who wasn't so predictably porcine.
The parole officer was one of the bright points of light.

3599406,1,B001GCUO6Q,"This movie has the characteristics of the writer deciding first on a destination and then pasted together a smattering--not a series--of scenes along the way without considering whether the audience, starting from the beginning, would find those scenes to be acceptable wayposts on the journey. Most of the scenes were ones that could have been cut without adversely affecting the flow of the movie. If you experience movies as a collection of impressions, this may be OK, as evidenced by the 5-star reviews here. Similarly if you enjoy watching technical acting exercises.  However, if you value coherence, logic, plausible characters and the journey, you will likely detest this movie.

The movie's ""secret"" is revealed in a few stages, but with each revelation, I immediately guessed what the next one would be, and then had to wait interminably for that to be confirmed.  The ending is so horribly contrived and implausible that it insults the intelligence.  It is wrong in so many ways that it is impossible to say enough bad things about it (other reviews here go into details, but require spoilers).

The journey to that ending is almost as bad--it lacks any credible motivation.  Example: The supposed motivation for the sister Lea to reconnect is literally paper-thin--a form letter from the prison authorities.  Hardly enough to overcome 15 years of estrangement. Example: Why would the family have believed Juliette (KST) capable/guilty of ""the unspeakable crime""? What the audience is presented with is to the contrary, although I did spot a tidbit that, if further developed, might have been the beginning of a tangential hint.

In this class of movie, you expect the journey to include the growth or transformation of at least one of the characters, often as discovery of truths about themselves.  Not here--all you get are static characters, with details being slowly dispensed to the audience.  Furthermore, the characters lack authenticity because these details do not flow naturally, but are artificially withheld to service the plot's notion of pacing. Notably, _how_ the sister Lea goes about reconnecting plays entirely false.  A coherent script might have made this the core of the movie, with Lea the main character rather than Juliette.

DUBBING: I quickly lost patience with the French version and switched to dubbed (my French requires the assistance of subtitles).  Big mistake because the dubbing further emphasized the inauthenticity of the characters. The English dubbing is atrocious at two levels.  First, the audio technicians didn't bother to match audio levels nor to have the voices come from where the characters are on the screen, not even something as simple as left-right distinctions.  Often a character's voice erupted from the whole screen, or even from in front of the screen.  Second, the voice acting is bad. KST does her own and it is appropriate, but the others, especially the sister Lea, come across as amateur stage actors who make simplistic attempts at being dramatic but are primarily focused on getting the lines spoken--Think low-end Japanese anime or old Godzilla movies.",1263254400,9,3128,5.201195219123506

Ms. Scott Thomas embraces the role with intelligence and keen insight. She is multilingual, speaks flawlessly in French, wears no make-up in the film, and conveys most of her inner emotions through grey blue eyes and kinesics. The verbal brevity of her character, Juliette, sustains the dark family secret that resulted in her becoming a pariah, shunned by family, friends and colleagues... imprisoned for 15 years, leaving the viewer patiently awaiting any tidbit of information. The movie's title and premise is centered around the unwavering, yet cloudy relationship with her younger sister, the only family member willing to give her shelter. The viewer is chomping at the bit to know the secret, but the pace of the film allows one to comfortably wait it out as you follow her travails. She shines in her performance as a newly released inmate handling a demeaning position at work, dealing with a hostile brother-in-law, a new social interest, and an uncomfortable living situation. The viewer is drawn in immediately to her tremendous strength and despair, waiting for the unveiling of her past and how it will play on the present and future.

She has married a French citizen, I understand, and taken up residence there, which goes to explain her sudden presence in French movies.

The film, which was nominated for two Golden Globes, was written and directed by Philippe Claudel: it is ably carried by the superior acting of Scott Thomas, who surely deserved her Golden Globes nod, and ought, perhaps, to have done even better than that.  It concerns Juliette Fontaine, a frail woman, and a trained doctor, struggling to adjust herself to life, and her family, after having served 15 years in prison for the death of her son.  Many scenes are heart-wrenching tennis matches, between Scott Thomas, and Elsa Zylberstein, who plays her sister Lea, and never misses a shot, either.  I'd have to characterize it as a woman's picture, and a weeper, as well, emphasizing, as it does, children, emotion, love and other feelings.  I was moved by the film's emphasis on these verities: to me, they are the straw we need to build the bricks that make our lives worthwhile: and while I'm at it, let me add that I doubt any audience member would ever think the intelligent Scott Thomas would commit the crime for which she has been jailed without an overwhelmingly good reason.  But she surely does work up a head of emotional power, and, for an actor who began her career as a light comedienne, can now lay claim proudly to that traditional French theatrical title of acclaim: ""tragedienne.""

There will be reviews of some of that work in this space in the future but the mood of this recent film (2008) by Phillipe Claudel very much reminds of those earlier efforts.

*****

What is not to like about a very well done film (with French subtitles) about two estranged sisters, Lea and Juliette, who, because the older sister  Juliette was in prison for the ""murder"" of her young son (that really is, as we find out toward the end, whatever moral qualms you might have to the contrary was a mercy killing and not some ruthless, senseless crazy cold-blooded act as one is led to assume at the beginning of the film ) have to come to grips with the fact that they are strangers. Have no fear though blood ties will out here, as the older sister returns to normalcy though an exploration of her truncated relationship with her sister, the sister's husband, their two adopted children and assorted other interested parties. All through this film starring  Kristen Scott Thomas, the woman who was Ralph Fiennes' love interest (or he her's) in the excellent ""The English Patient"", as Juliette I kept thinking that while American director's specialize very well in a number of film genres they could never pull this off,  with a length of almost two hours to boot. It deserved an award for ""Best Foreign Film"". No question.",1248566400,,1438,4.645669291338582
3599456,3,B001GCUO6Q,"Let's be blunt: I don't care for characters who are turned in on themselves.  And, frankly, I am a little suspicious of those who do.

So much has been said about what a great performance this is.  IMO, you can not have a ""great performance"" in a role with a flat, uninteresting character and an emotional range from A to B.  I am not criticizing Ms. Thomas's performance; I am sure it was highly competent.  I am just not amused by spending the better part of two hours watching someone choke on her inner emotions, however nuanced.  Movies like this might be redeemed, IMO, with voice-over.  It works for Martin Scorsese; you'd think other filmmakers would give it a whirl.

As to my brooding suspicions, ""nuanced"" films attract the intellectually eager like honey draws flies.  Sometimes it seems that the less that is visible on the screen, the more animated certain types are in declaring the brilliance of the performance.  Taking oneself too seriously clouds the judgment.  Everybody agree what a brilliant critic Pauline Kael was.  A big part of her genius, I think, was that she didn't try too hard to find the art.

(I am not saying that a great turn on the screen necessarily require a lot of histrionics.  I am only saying the character cannot be flat, however much she grimaces.  A lot of drama happens to flat characters in real life; I just don't care to watch it.)",1247184000,,1380,4.621399176954733
3599457,2,B001GCUO6Q,"Sometimes too much good taste is a bad thing.  Despite its potentially melodramatic premise, ""I've Loved You So Long"" is restrained to a fault.  There is little drama, just a gradual accumulation of moments depicted as tastefully as the domestic details of its bourgeois French setting.  Tame, well-behaved scenes pile up like bric-a-brac.  The movie is clearly intended to be a low-key chamber piece, but it errs too far in this direction and ends up muted and dull.  By the time the script calls for Kristin Scott Thomas to turn up the heat just a bit, I had lost patience and was amusing myself by trying to translate backwards from the subtitles.  I stopped watching about three quarters of the way through, when it began to telegraph a cop-out plot twist that drained the last few drops of interest from the story.  ""I've Loved You So Long"" looks good on paper, but in practice is eminently forgettable.

3599458,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Your reaction to this French film will depend entirely on your appreciation of acting, of the near-miraculous performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Elsa Zylberstein as sisters reunited after a calamity. I WILL NOT tell you anything more about the tale. Director Philippe Claudel doesn't want me to; his film is artfully structured to keep the viewer uninformed, perhaps even unwarned, of various facts. THERE ARE NO FLASHBACKS, and that in itself is refreshing in the context of the ""cinema"" of today. The performances of the two sister/actresses is so convincing, and the cinematography so crafty, that any reservations some reviewers have expressed about the plausibility of the plot need not be heeded. If Scott Thomas and Zylberstein were singers, and their acting were a Baroque duet by Handel, I'd hitchhike across Texas in tie-dye and love beads to hear them.

I suppose I might mention that this is a sad, sad story, not a piquant French comedy. My wife chose it, I was skeptical through the first ten minutes - until the background musak vanished - and then I began to believe in the characters.",1246406400,,1107,4.951612903225806
3599459,3,B001GCUO6Q,"This review will have spoilers, so you have been alerted!

I loved this movie until the very end, found it moving, real, etc., which I don't often do in French movies.  Then I started thinking: HOW could nobody know about her son's illness?  HOW could her husband have testified against her?  HOW could her sister's friends, and her sister not have read about the case in the papers...so the movie does not stand up under even the lightest of scrutinies.  Until I reached that realization, it was great.  Kristen Scott Thomas is brilliant, absolutely, as are some of the other actors, but the story, so earnest, actually is hollow and ultimately silly.",1246406400,17,652,4.776785714285714
3599520,5,B001GCUO6Q,"[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]

I need to watch a movie like this once in a while.  Otherwise I might never cry.  And crying is cathartic.

French cinema is about relationships.  I wonder how it became so intensely about relationships in a way that no other national cinema is about relationships.  I don't know.  This one is about the relationship between sisters done in a way that I have never seen before.  And that I like.  I am so bored with reprises and remakes of themes, as good as they sometimes are.  This is not about sisterhood politically.  And thank you for that.  It is about real sisterhood under confusing and difficult circumstances, when there is estrangement for very good reasons, yet there is love to overcome whatever it is that causes the distance.

In this case Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas) has been released after 15 years in prison. Her younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) who always adored her and looked up to her takes her in.  She has her own family, two adopted Vietnamese girls, a husband and a father who is old and can no longer speak.  Naturally bringing Juliette into their household is risky.  What has Juliette done and why?  It is really unspeakable and yet Lea believes like all ""bleeding hearts"" that her sister is essentially good and whatever happened happened for a reason, and so do we in the audience.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays this part of the film with a long, suffering face and the sort of resignation that comes with complete defeat.  So we know.  Whatever happened to her, whatever she did was forced upon her by the fates.  What we don't know is exactly what that was.

I cannot say enough about the exquisite performances by both Kristin Scott Thomas and Elsa Zylberstein.  The direction by Philippe Claudel was, in the French manner, focused on people and who they are, done unobtrusively in the best invisible style in which the story and the characters are what we see without directorial distraction.  We are lost in the story and the existential conflict between what we are and what is thought of us by others.  We are caught between the appearance of life and the reality.",1245888000,2,2265,4.644836272040302

Also grand was Elsa Zylbershtein, as KST's sister in this film.  Loved her work in ""Modigliani"" opposite Andy Garcia.",1245024000,,446,4.766233766233766

Juliette moves in with the young family of her sister Lea, who despite the secrets both spoken and unspoken tells Juliette, ""I'm glad that you're here, it's a very good idea."" Lea was only a teenager when Juliette left, but her diaries show that she marked very single day that her sister was gone. Her husband Luc, two adopted toddlers from Vietnam, and Luc's aging father who's silent from a stroke, all together provide a redemptive family context for Juliette's recovery. ""Family is important,"" says one of the several counselors with whom Juliette must meet every month, ""you're lucky. Most people have nothing when they get out."" Families are the contexts of so much pain, but in this film it also shows that families can be places of healing, no matter how horrific the past.

3599526,5,B001GCUO6Q,"""I've Loved You So Long"" is a masterful story of personal tragedy and redemption.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays the lead role of a woman who suffers two unspeakably terrible experiences, pushing her into a retreat from living and all personal relationships.  The film is a slow chronicle of her gradual retrieval from that tragic isolation by a loving sister and patient friends.  This story has a slow reveal, but is well worth the viewer's wait as Thomas' character comes back to life.

Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful as she builds a character that we at first find less than sympathetic but eventually care for a great deal.  The rest of the cast is superb and the direction is extraorindary.  Truly one of  the better films of the past five years.",1242604800,2,752,4.7384615384615385

We started the film with the English voice overs. Don't do it.

Switching back to the subtitles, the acting and the mystery of the story kept us engaged throughout the film.  I love French film, generally, all angsty and uptight characters learning to be a little relaxed and this wasn't a let down.

What did let me down was the big 'reveal' at the end with regard to Scott Thomas's character.  I don't want to spoil the ending, but I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who can say her reasoning was sound for keeping the details of her secret regarding the death of her son.

It was pure stupidity.

I've heard some complaints about the ending, and I will agree that the ending was weak... in retrospect.  While watching the movie I was right with the characters.

3599551,5,B001GCUO6Q,"The film:

I don't want to spoil this film for you, as a great deal of enjoyment is to be had in the slow unfolding of its characters' lives to the viewer. So, in the briefest terms possible, it is about a French woman who is returning to society after a stay in prison. Through the course of the film we see the main character Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas) attempt to reintegrate herself into the world of her sister and her sister's family.

It's hard to find the superlatives for Kristin Scott Thomas' work here. Simply put, she is an actor of the highest rank. She completely inhabits her character, and gives us exactly what we need to have a look into the character's soul, but without bludgeoning us over the head with obviousness, as some actors are won't to do. Every facial muscle is in her control, giving us slight twitches and smiles, movements of eyelids, all of the cues we would see in a real person of our acquaintance, that we would use to clue us in to their internal state.

Equally good is the writing. Instead of bald-faced expository scenes, we are given the story in the sort of real conversational threads that we might be presented with if we were a fly on the wall, not a stupid audience member being instructed. There is no narration, no summary, just real scenes, as if we were witnessing them in real life. This was very refreshing, when so many films deign to hold the viewer's hand through the entire run time.

In concert, the acting, the writing, and the directing/cinematography  create what is called ""cinema verite."" Nothing pulls you out of the reality of the portrait we are given of the character. It is utterly absorbing, and the desire to find out everything easily propels the viewer through the 1:50 teleplay.

The Blu-Ray:

Sony has presented us with a video transfer that, at first, I thought was shot on video. The reason I thought this was that there was such clarity of detail and dimensionality to the picture that it couldn't be from celluloid. In fact, this movie was shot on film. A very slight but persistent grain structure is evident upon closer inspection, and it is very nice that they did not slather the image with digital noise reduction, but instead left it the way it is.

Detail starts out stunning, and generally holds up throughout the film. This is a movie with a lot of close ups of faces and hands, and it really makes you look at people differently - so many movies are spit-shined, air-brushed, and stars are made up to within an inch of their lives. Here, we see every wrinkle, vein, sinew, knuckle, and dark circle under an eye. It is perhaps a little jarring at first, but eventually I was reminded that this, in fact, is how real people look. This realism adds to the aforementioned ""you are there"" feeling.

There are a few scenes which get a tiny bit soft, but they are few and far between. Overall, this is a sterling HD presentation. The depth and clarity of the image help the process of drawing the viewer in - complementing an amazing performance to a tee.

Audio is unspectacular, but this is of course and extremely dialogue-driven film. French and English dubs are available, with the English dub featuring Thomas' vocal work, in a nice touch. I would recommend the French track with subtitles, though, since almost the entire film is acted in French, including all of Thomas' lines. Extras include a few deleted scenes.

*******

So in the end, I suppose the questions are two: should you see this film? I would say that unreservedly, anyone who is a fan of acting, art, performance, drama, and realistic character portraits of human beings should see this film. If you want explosions and one-liners, you might be better served by a Nicolas Cage vehicle.

The other question is: should you own it? That's a bit thornier. After you've seen it once, you know the backstory of the main character, and thus a fair amount of your drive to see the film has been satisfied. Why watch it again?

Fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, or of truly great acting performances in general, should have this on their shelf. This is a two hour master class, pressed onto a disc.

Everyone else might benefit more from a rental. The subject matter is a bit of a downer, although there is a fair amount of bittersweet uplift by the end. It's not the kind of thing you'll pop in on a rainy day to liven things up.",1241222400,8,4375,4.5625

She should have won an Oscar for her acting, which never once seems anything but real.  Why and if she murdered her son is a mystery until the very end of the movie.  It seems impossible to reconcile the image of a former doctor and gentle person with such a callous and brutal act.

The film focuses on the present and Juliette's efforts to adapt to society after all those incarcerated years.  Thanks to her loyal and loving sister and her sister's family she gradually makes that transition.  When we first see Juliette on screen, her face is marred by harsh lines and sadness. She is so toughened that we know instantly that she has suffered traumatically.  Like a wounded animal, she learns to trust and with that trust her face softens, her personality changes, and we see the real Juliette emerge.

This French film has an intimate, art house-feeling to it; it's all about unraveling Juliette's secret in spite of her sullenness and silence.  Thomas, who often plays disdainful posh women, is wonderful as the haunted Juliette.  We sympathize with her even before we learn her secret; afterward, we feel her pain and loss.  Though Juliette is a woman of very few words, her tortured face reveals the agony within.

The story is a moody mystery with touching performances and a poignant script.  If you like the little song, ""A la Claire Fontaine,"" you'll be humming it for days after watching this movie.

However, in spite of feeling this is a great movie, I was a bit leary of the reason she was sent away to prison in the end.... and especially that she had shared none of her findings with her husband at that time.  That part made no sense since she was supposedly in a good marriage until the crime.  And that no autopsy or anything was done which would obviously have also shown what she alone knew.

3599557,5,B001GCUO6Q,"I'm a little embarrassed to review this movie because some other Amazon reviewers have already done such a good job.  Yet in the end I'll add my ten cents worth because it bears repeating that this is definitely a movie to be seen by anyone who cares about quality film-making.  Kristen Scott Thomas turns in the performance of a lifetime (how good it is to see her break free of those Repressed English Wife roles she tends to get stuck with) and the rest of the cast turn in performances that are almost on a par. The plot of the movie is less important than the subtlety with which the portrait of Scott Thomas' character is drawn.  Shakespeare's plots, for example, are often a bit thin but it is his characterization and wonderful lines that we resonate with.  Likewise with Il y a Longtemps Que Je T'Aime the plot device is merely the vehicle upon which to hang the central themes of love and suffering and forgiveness.

Some reviewers appear to be unable to come to terms with the notion of mercy killing, and thus their reviews all descend into a monotonic rant of ""it's impossible to believe she'd kill her own son.""  Perhaps a quick glance over the Atlantic would help, because euthanasia is actually an important topic that receives a wide range of consideration in many countries outside the USA. More important than whether one ""believes"" it would be possible for a loving mother to want to spare her child unbearable suffering, the point of the movie is that no action is without consequences and we must learn somehow to live with them afterwards.  American movies are too often full of violence and at the end the protagonist rides off into the sunset untroubled by the slaughter. Real life is much more complex than this, thank goodness, and this movie is really the antithesis of such pablum. This movie is about the ""what happened afterwards"" and although the denouement does feel just a trifle contrived it does so not because of its psychological veracity but because of the ""surprise ending"" cinematic convention. This movie didn't need such an artifice - it stands firmly on its main themes and superb execution in all areas.  Really there is nothing weak at all in this film.  Other reviewers have accurately commented on the superb performances, the superior camera work, the direction and editing.  Everything works as it should, quietly and discretely, contributing to this beautiful little masterpiece.",1238976000,6,2430,4.819711538461538
3599558,4,B001GCUO6Q,"A moving, powerful drama ""I've Loved You So Long"" may not be for everyone but there's no disputing the craft in the film and the power in the BAFTA (the UK version of the Oscars)nominated performance of Kristin Scott Thomas (""The English Patient"", ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" and the forthcoming ""Nowhere Boy"" where she plays John Lennon's Aunt Mimi). Thomas plays Juliette who after fifteen yearsr in prison is suddenly and somewhat reluctantly reunited with her younger sister (Esla Zylberstein). Estranged from her family after she murders someone (I don't want to spoil the film for you), Philipe Claudel's film will capture your attention with the complex characters he has created for his film. The actors all do an outstanding job and Thomas who is British but has lived in France on and off for many years, gives a brilliant performance as a lost soul in French her second language--a very difficult task for most actors but here she tackles it with stunning realism completely inhabiting Juliette.

The Blu-ray looks stunning for the most part. There are a few scenes that are a bit soft looking but on the whole the detail, texture and colors in the film are brilliantly reproduced for Blu-ray. The film is in French with English subtitles and although there is an English dialog option (with Thomas providing her own voice and doing a stunning job there, too although the other performances are hit or miss). Audio sounds extremely good here although you need to be aware this isn't the type of film to give your 5.1 or 7.1 surround system a work out.

Extras are disappointing. While we do get deleted scenes with optional commentary from the director (in French with English subtitles), I would have liked a full commentary track (something I suspect they got overseas) with a second set of English subtitles for those of us who are a bit rusty at speaking French (or those of us who took Spanish). Aside from that we only get the original theatrical trailer (which is quite good)and previews. I would have loved to see featurettes (and if Sony is looking for volunteers to do the featurettes--I'll do them)focusing on the challenge of Thomas playing her role in what in French. I'd also like to have seen a featurette focusing on the inspiration of the film and the director's choices in the film--we see a couple of deleted/alternate scenes which were equally as powerful in their own way and while he explains why he went in another direction in the optional commentary, I would have liked to hear more about the process myself.

An incredibly, moving and sad film that has the hope of redemption, ""I've Loved You So Long"" should have earned Thomas an Oscar nod. All the performances are strong. My only complaint is that the editing is a bit eliptic at times with an occasional scene set up without resolution (on the other hand that also makes many moments of the film that much more tense), I found this to be a very involving movie.",1238803200,2,2954,4.754385964912281

The movie is done very well, interesting shots of the sister's life and friends, but ultimately feels like a waste of time to find out that ... SPOILER ALERT ... a child's illness and death brought out a woman's self-destructive urges.  It's also hard to believe that anyone would get 15 years in Europe for euthanizing a child in severe pain who had only days to live.  Murderers get less.

3599610,5,B001GCUO6Q,"A poem to someone they love-'I've Loved You So Long'. The beginning or the end of an extraordinary journey, depends on how you look at this.

Juliette played by Kristen Scott Thomas is picked up at the airport by her sister. Both sisters have been long lost- one to prison, Juliette; the other, Lea to a family who removed Juliette from their lives. They pick up as Juliette moves into Lea's home with her husband, two children and a father-in-law who cannot speak as a result of a stroke. How does one go about learning to live a life after 15 years in prison, with difficulty. Along the way, Juliette meets people who help her move into the mainstream. Along the way comes difficulties, how to explain those missing 15 years, the aloofness, the inability to connect with others.

Kristin Scott Thomas is extraordinary in this role. She is able to convey with a flick of her eyes or a downward glance the emotions of a woman just barely able to breathe.  The supporting cast is perfect- a caring sister, a brother-in-law who is not trusting and two children who love their aunt, just because.  Juliette reports weekly to a probation officer who may be one of the few who understand her old world and how to come to terms with her new world.  The men she meets along her journey- she does not give her heart freely.

""Anton Chekhov, the Russian author whose works famously presented major emotions in a minor key, finding hard nuggets of truth in the small details of everyday life. And Kristen Scott Thomas is Chekhovian in every manner."" Peter Travers

This is a flawless role for Kristin Scott Thomas. She is the film, this is a master class in fine acting.

3599611,5,B001GCUO6Q,"""I've Loved You So Long"" is a French-language movie that stars Kristin Scott Thomas as a woman haunted by her past. Having served prison time for 15 years for murder, Juliette Fontaine is released on parole and goes to live with her younger sister, Lea [Elsa Zylberstein] who was only a teenager when Juliette was sent to prison. Juliette finds it awkward reconnecting with people, and it's especially hard as Lea is married and has two adopted Vietnamese daughters, and a father-in-law who is recovering from a stroke. Things are made more difficult by Lea's husband Michel who can't reconcile with Juliette's living with them, considering the crime she committed. I won't give too much of the plot away, as this is a movie that unfolds slowly and rewards the patient viewer with all the necessary information in good time.

The plot may seem slow in revealing the details one wishes to know, such as the unspeakable crime  Juliette has committed and why she is such a tormented, distant soul, but this actually worked for me as Juliette's character is fully- developed here and the viewer is rewarded with one of the most poignant and nuanced performance by an actress. Kristin Scott-Thomas is remarkable in this movie, and her French is excellent [there is also an English audio option in which she actually does the dubbing for her part]. Her portrayal of a fragile and tormented woman who is haunted by her past and struggling to go on with her life on a daily basis is nothing short of amazing. She truly deserved the Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Elsa Zylberstein is also very credible as lea, Juliette's compassionate younger sister who tries her best to penetrate the wall of silence Juliette has erected around her. The supporting cast also does a good job - the tortured parole officer who pines for his ex-wife and kids, the college lecturer who is romantically interested in Juliette and a few others - I thought the cast did a credible job in holding the film together and elevating it above another melodrama.

This is a depressing movie and definitely one that leaves you pondering on many important life issues - choices, regrets, relationships and many more. But, I feel more enlightened for having watched it, and would recommend it to anyone who is keen on human dramas with substance.",1237680000,16,2320,4.838790931989925
3599612,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Kristin Scott Thomas plays Juliette Fontaine, a British woman whose family relocated to France when she was a child.  She has been away, and her younger sister, Lea (Elsa Zylberstein), picks her up at the airport.  Where Juliette has been and why she has been away for so long are revealed gradually, resulting in an almost mystery-like tension.  However, even if you already know pieces of this ""mystery,"" the tension is still palpable, although my review won't reveal any additional details.

What I enjoyed about ""I've Loved You So Long"" is the circuitous path this French film takes.  Just when I thought I had guessed where it would go next, it zigged and zagged and ended up someplace else completely.  I also loved the complex character portrayed by Scott Thomas.  Juliette is a catalog of contrariness - she's drab yet luminous, cool yet simmering with emotions, angry yet hurt and vulnerable.  She's complex, which is something we don't see often enough in movies, and Scott Thomas plays her masterfully.  In lesser hands, Juliette would come across as simply stubborn and aloof, but we can see more beneath this hard exterior long before Scott Thomas makes it overt.  She won several awards for her work, and she should have received an Academy Award nomination as well (her performance was far better than Angelina Jolie in ""The Changeling"").  Her Juliette arguably is the highlight of her career, even better than her work in ""The English Patient.""

The setting for the film is also inspired.  Rather than filming in Paris or sunny Southern France, ""I've Loved You So Long"" takes place in gloomier Northern France, near the city of Nancy.  The cinematography is pitch perfect throughout without being too obvious.  The rain-soaked and dreary days correspond perfectly to Juliette's drab clothing color palette (she dresses like a depressed secretary) to convey a strong environment for the character to inhabit.  Finally, I appreciated that ""I've Loved You So Long"" is essentially an old-fashioned tear-jerker, yet it aspires to be more.  And it succeeds.  The emotional scenes aren't meant to simply wring a tear from the audience but also to make us think.  The film tackles difficult issues involving family and loyalty, but it isn't afraid to be a bit cerebral and even a tad sexy at times.",1237161600,5,2306,4.973890339425587
3599613,2,B001GCUO6Q,"'Il y a longtemps que je t'aime' is the story about a woman who's been in prison for murdering her six year old son and after being paroled, goes to live with her younger sister and her family. The film intentionally is set up so that we don't learn the reason why the woman commits the murder until the film's climax.

The reason and circumstances of the murder are so implausible that it ruins an otherwise fairly engrossing drama. The story follows Juliette Fontaine (Kristen Scott Thomas) as she attempts to adjust to her new life outside of prison. In the beginning, she's basically an emotional basket case. After being picked up by her sister Lea, just after her release from prison, she can hardly communicate at all. For the first half hour, there are long silences despite Lea's attempts to get Juliette to 'open up'. She's so cut off that she ends up yelling at Lea's adopted Vietnamese daughter (wonderfully played by child actor Lise Segur) after the child asks her to read her a bedtime story. Juliette even meets a man at a bar and has sex with him at a hotel (but admits that she takes no enjoyment in it).

Juliette begins meeting with her parole officer (in France, it appears the Police officers serve that function). The Parole Officer is an odd fellow who seems like he's the one in need of a therapist (he's constantly revealing his personal feelings to Juliette in their meetings; later it is revealed that he has inexplicably committed suicide!). A social worker arranges for Juliette to have a job interview at a small factory but is thrown out of the office by the firm's boss after he learns that she's a child murderer.

Eventually, Juliette begins to become more communicative especially with the children who take a liking to her. She overcomes Lea's husband's (Luc's) distrust of her who initially doesn't want her near the children. On the job front, she obtains a probationary position at a hospital as a medical transcriptionist. At first, she almost loses the job as she's very aloof with fellow employees; but after the hospital director implores her to be more friendly, she eventually opens up and is offered a permanent position.

Lea also introduces Juliette to her colleague Marcel, a professor at the university where she also teaches. Marcel is probably the most interesting character in the film--a wise middle-aged man who has had his share of heartaches. Marcel expresses interest in Juliette but she's not ready to get involved. (later it's suggested that she finally does get involved with him.) A party scene foreshadows the overall implausibility of the film's plot. When a drunken colleague of Lea's insists that Juliette reveal information about her past, she blurts out that she was in 15 years in prison for murder. Everyone at the table however takes it at as a joke (except for Marcel). Why no one there had ever heard of this murder case (even 15 years ago) is highly implausible. France is a small country compared to the United States and the murder of a child would certainly be the type of case that at least someone at the dinner table would have remembered (or if anyone had an interest in Juliette, they could have googled her on their computer a few days earlier and found out about her sordid past in a few seconds).

This brings us to the film's unlikely climax. Lea finds a picture of her murdered nephew along with a love note written by her sister to the boy. The note is written on the back of the boy's medical report which Lea brings to her own physician and asks him to decipher it. It seems that the boy had some kind of fatal illness, information which somehow Juliette was able to keep from her husband and other members of her family. While it's revealed that Juliette knew from the beginning that the boy was sick, no one notices it except Juliette.

Eventually, Juliette takes the boy away from the father (and is later accused of kidnapping him). Instead of seeking help from her fellow physicians, she's convinced (since she's a doctor) that her son is a complete terminal case. She decides to end his suffering by injecting him with an overdose of some kind of medication, killing him (in effect, a mercy killing). I can understand a mother ending up performing euthanasia on an elderly parent but on a six year old? No way. A mother would have tried to get help (even if her own instincts as a physician told her that the chances were basically nil). What's more, wouldn't an autopsy have revealed that the child was terminally ill? Would the prosecutor have prosecuted Juliette without determining a motive? Hardly likely. In addition, if the child was suffering tremendously (such as in the case of terminal cancer patients), there are always some kinds of drugs (such as morphine) to alleviate the suffering of patients in the final days of their illness.

Il y a longtemps que je t'aime devolves into a tale of an undeserved redemption. Juliette is redeemed due to the mitigating circumstances of her crime. In the end, she's let off the hook because she didn't really commit a murder but rather a mercy killing (an event which takes place only in the wild imagination of the film's scenarist). Lea's unconditional and unquestioning love for her sister would have been seen as something quite different at the film's climax (perhaps a form of naivety or gullibility) had Juliette's motive for killing her son turned out to be more sinister or nefarious in some way.

Il y a longtemps que je t'aime is an engrossing drama undermined by plotting which was not thought out carefully from the very beginning. This is unfortunate for the actors who for the most part, present solid and convincing performances.",1236988800,8,5693,4.743434343434344
3599614,2,B001GCUO6Q,"I've Loved You So Long was a major disappointment.  Doubly so because it has such superb performances by the two lead actresses, and excellent direction and cinematography.  But the plot... particularly the ""revelation"" at the end... makes the whole story stupid, and utterly divorced from reality.  It totally ruins what could have been a fine moive.  As it is, I WOULD NOT recommend sitting thru the 2 hrs of this film only to be insulted by the proposition that a PHYSICIAN, who had spent years on a career, and had repeatedly seen lethal disease arbitrarily visit all sorts of patients... including children... would throw away her career, her marriage, and her very life, just to keep silent about the fact she engaged in a perfectly sane, reasonable mercy killing, even tho she knew that meant spending a good fraction of her life in prison.  Sorry if I ""spoiled it"", but that is the plot... and it's stupid and absurd.  I speak as a human being, and as a physician, and as one whose seen and appreciated a great deal of American and French cinema over my 58 years.  Again... superb, sustained and nuanced presentation of characters by the truly superb two lead female actors, fine cinematography, and totally insultingly ridiculous plot that ruins the first two.  A REALLY bad decision to waste this talent on such a wretched throw-away incompetent and implausible tale.  Check out reviews in Rotten Tomatoes... you'll see many said the same thing I did here.",1236902400,17,1466,4.855421686746988
3599615,5,B001GCUO6Q,"This is a very touching film about the power of a sister's love and a loving community.  This is the story of two sisters that had been separated for 15 years.  The younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) had adored her older sister Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas) but she had to be separated from Juliette due to Juliette's prison term for murder of her son.

The movie begins with how the two sisters were reunited at the airport, and then like a puzzle, we get bits and pieces of the information -- the viewer slowly begins to understand what happened to Juliette and why she committed her deed.  While this is happening, we are drawn to the transforming power of Lea's love for her sister Juliette, as Juliette slowly begins to pick up the pieces of her tragic life and begin to welcome life and love once more.

I can't go much further without spoiling the movie.  I want to say that Kristin Scott Thomas' acting is nothing short of amazing.  When we see her at the beginning of the movie, she is a living block of ice and her face expresses cold detachment coupled with extremely deep despair.  We slowly get to see that ice thaw out, and Scott Thomas slowly metamorphasizes before our eyes.  Thomas' French is impeccable as well.

Much credit also goes to Elsa Zylberstein's portrayal as Lea -- despite the hurt she's gone through, we see the unconditional love expressed through her expressions and her actions.  It is moving also to see people around Juliette gradually get to accept her and love her for who she is -- warts, woundedness, and all.

The little bit parts are what makes this movie special.  We see the change in perspective in how Lea's skeptical husband views Juliette.  We see the sympathetic parole officer who enjoys his time talking to Juliette and expressing his desire to explore the Orinoco river.  There's also Lea's male colleague Michele, who gradually forms a close friendship with Juliette, and who displays genuine empathy for Juliette's condition.  There are the two adoring Vietnamese girls who play the daughters adopted by Lea and her husband Luc.

By the end of the movie, all the pieces of puzzle fit together, but also we see the light and the sunshine piercing through the gloom and darkness.  What a powerful movie about how love can pierce through the darkness and melt the iciness of our broken and detached hearts.  Simply amazing!",1236643200,2,2379,4.716707021791768
3599616,4,B001GCUO6Q,"Kristin Scott Thomas gives a beautifully controlled and radiant performance in ""I've Loved You So Long,"" playing the role of a middle-aged woman who has just spent the last fifteen years of her life in prison for murdering her six-year-old son.  Now paroled, Juliette has temporarily moved in with the only family still left to her: her much younger sister, Lea; Lea's husband, Luc; and their two adopted daughters.  Readjusting to life on the outside is difficult for Juliette, since she has pretty much built an emotional and psychological wall between herself and the world around her.  Slowly, however, thanks to the tender ministrations of her sister and the older of her two nieces, Juliette begins, ever so cautiously, to find her way back into that world.

Given its sensationalistic subject matter, ""I've Loved You So Long"" could easily have devolved into overwrought histrionics or melodrama.  Instead, first time director Philippe Claudel (who also wrote the screenplay) has taken a more subdued, character-oriented approach to the material, holding his cards close to the vest, allowing the details of this woman`s past to emerge slowly and by degrees.  As such, Juliette remains something of an enigma throughout the course of the movie - intriguing us all the more and drawing us ever deeper into her character.  In fact, the people in her life don`t know much more about her than we do, since she was arrested when Lea was still a teen (their parents refused to acknowledge Juliette's existence after her conviction and forbade Lea from having anything to do with her) and Juliette has never revealed to anyone - not even her own ex-husband - the motive for her heinous crime.

As the buttoned-down Juliette, Thomas manages to convey a wealth of meaning through the subtlest of facial expressions and gestures, while Elsa Zylberstein makes for a perfect foil as the openhearted kid sister.  In his premiere work as a director, Claudel demonstrates remarkable restraint and control, allowing the material to unfold at an appropriately deliberate and unhurried pace, never feeling the need to push a point or to overstate the obvious.  He also reveals a fine eye for detail and composition, resulting in a very clean, uncluttered look for the film.  But it is his work with actors - drawing from them performances of great depth and beauty - that most distinguishes his filmmaking here.",1236470400,3,2399,5.032828282828283
3599617,5,B001GCUO6Q,"I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG ('Il y a longtemps que je t'aime)  is novelist Phillipe Claudel's first screenplay (he also serves as director).  If this film is an indication of the themes and stories he has to tell then a new and gifted artist has come our way. Claudel knows how to take his audience along what appears to be a very quiet film while at the same time drawing the viewer into a story that feels like quicksand, so surely and gradually is the powerful element of the story revealed.

Juliette (a radiantly gifted Kristin Scott Thomas) has been imprisoned for murder for fifteen years and is released to the care of her emotionally estranged sister L&eacute;a (Elsa Zylberstein): when young physician Juliette was quietly sentenced to prison, the sisters' parents disowned Juliette and raised L&eacute;a as an only child, refusing to allow her to communicate with her older sister.  L&eacute;a is now married to Luc (Serge Hazanavicius) and the couple has adopted tow Vietnamese girls: L&eacute;a did not want to give birth to a child (an early clue as to the horrors revealed ahead).  Juliette is practically mute, so seldom does she converse, and Luc is worried about having Juliette in his house: the 'murder' for which Juliette uncontestedly was imprisoned was her six year old son.

Juliette meets with her parole officer Capitaine Faur&eacute; (Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot) who is supportive and shares Juliette's view of the world.  She is interviewed and denied jobs because of her crime, but meets a few people with whom she can connect - especially the kindly Michel (Laurent Gr&eacute;vill).  Gradually Juliette warms to her sister's family and to L&eacute;a to whom she tells the tragic facts of her past, facts that allow us to realize why Juliette is such a damaged creature.

The profound acting performance by Kristen Scott Thomas is a wonder to watch.  The entire cast to very fine but Scott Thomas is riveting in a story that in another's hands would not have gained our empathy to the extent she achieves.  There is much social commentary in this film with many levels of meaning that only become apparent after the film is over.  It is a stunning masterpiece and deserves the attention of everyone who appreciates quality cinema.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, March 09",1236384000,,2315,4.948320413436693
3599618,5,B001GCUO6Q,"A former doctor, Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas), reenters the world after spending 15 years in jail for killing her son. In prison Juliette is labeled the ""absent one"". Upon Juliette's release, her younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein), who was still a child when Juliette entered prison, welcomes Juliette into her home. Juliette is cold and distant. She is going through the motions, but seems to have little desire to engage. Certainly prison is a part of her desire to keep to herself, but the viewer is left wondering if Juliette wasn't always a bit cold. It takes a bit of detachment to kill your child, even if he is sick.  Lea works to find inroads into her sister with little success. Eventually life's complications work to break down Juliette's reserve.

A quiet, contemplative film. Kristin Scott Thomas plays the part of the complicated, strong and intelligent Juliette brilliantly.",1236297600,3,896,5.047297297297297
3599619,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Amazing, powerful and yet hearbreaking!  An amazing performance by Hellen Scott Thomas!

The film is about a woman named Juliette Fontaine (Kristin Scott Thomas) who is released from prison after serving 15-years for murder.

She comes to stay with her sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) and her family and since the crime, she hasn't really been too talkative, in fact, she has been quite detached.

No one, including her sister knows why Juliette committed such an unspeakable crime and for Lea, it has put a strain on her marriage because as a mother of two young children, her husband Luc (Serge Hazanavicius) feels very awkward of a her staying with them or even being around their kids.

But for Juliette, she's trying her best to get her life back and you watch how being with family and friends starts to get her back on her feet but yet, you are left wondering how a woman who had so much in her life could do something unthinkable.

The levels that Helen Scott Thomas had to portray for Juliette is just astounding and the supporting cast, especially Elsa Zylberstein's role as the sister Lea, who is estranged from her sister but wanting to connect with her but also help her through her difficult times, everything just works fantastically.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG"" is a film that has been released both on Blu-ray and DVD.  The film is presented in a 1:85:1 aspect ratio via anamorphic widescreen and with a film shot in Paris, there are some beautiful outdoor shots but a lot of the shots are indoor and takes place in the home of Lea and Luc.  I don't recall seeing any tremendous amount of grain nor any artifacts.  The film looked very good on DVD and I would assume even more on Blu-ray.

As for audio, this film is strictly dialogue.  No need for special effects, nor are their any action scenes.  It's a film based on emotions and thus, everything is heard clearly via the front channels of your speakers.  Audio is presented in French and English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The English language version features the voice of Kristin Scott Thomas but the acting in the original French language was my preference and again, acting was well-done for this film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This DVD features one special feature and that is deleted scenes featuring optional commentary by Director Philippe Claudel.  Most of the scenes revolve around how much pressure on Lea and specifically Luc who is not thrilled about her staying with them around their kids.  Also, several alternate scenes that I'm glad were not used in the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG"" is such a powerful and emotional yet heartbreaking film.  I was very impressed between the performances by both Kristin Scott Thomas and Elsa Zylberstein.  But Kristin Scott Thomas was just stunning!

To play a role with such pain and torment and slowly coming out of that darkness was just well-done.

The film is well-written but I have to admit that the film does take a while in order to get to the final reveal.  Director and writer Philippe Claudel really takes his time to let the viewer know about the crime, about her former profession and of course why she committed the crime.

Also, I enjoyed the correlations of paintings.  While watching the film, I've asked myself if certain scenes were constructed almost like a painting, artistic in a manner of how you see a person's sorrow through a painting and you see that sorrow with Juliette, and was happy to find out through the optional commentary that the Director Phillipe Claudel definitely intended that and even had more scenes that would relate to a painting but felt there were more than enough in the final cut.

Now, is the film perfect?  Let me just say that I loved the film.  It was a powerful film but playing the devil's advocate, for a second, for this type of crime, especially when revealed at the end of why.  Without spoiling the film... Would a person be incarcerated for that long especially around the details of what transpired?  No compassion by the court?  Even by her ex-husband?  That was my main conflict after having reflected on the film.  But I'm not going to let that take away from how wonderful film truly is.

Overall, ""I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG"" is just a tremendous film.  Highly recommended!",1235865600,3,4281,4.710632570659489

The movie suggests that some rewards can be found in continuing to love those who earned your love in the past, long after everyone else has stopped loving them - especially if they are accused of allegations that are never fully proven or explained.

It is also an excellent film because it takes up important subjects like forgiveness, healing, courage, and grace. It gets at the ironic beauty and pain of life without being heavy-handed and melodramatic. I went to see this film three times...as I don't speak French, I spent the first screening reading it.

3599642,5,B001GCUO6Q,"I loved this film.  Another reviewer called it a ""grey day movie.""  I think that statement captures the film's mood and feel perfectly.

Philippe Claudel - this movie's writer and director - just takes you into this little world he constructed for 1 hour and 55 minutes.  Along the way, his damaged protagonist - indelibly played by Kristin Scott Thomas (lovely and talented in two languages & deserving of her Golden Globe nomination) - lets out small bits of what led her to be confined to prison for such a long stretch.  Elsa Zylberstein is fetching and winning as Scott Thomas' on-screen baby sister, La.  Her love and commitment for her sister, Juliette (Ms. Scott Thomas) - no matter the cost - is brave and, ultimately, triumphant.

And, hey, in a Hollywood movie you'd never see a guy looking like Laurent Grvill getting to woo the girl in such an understated and respectful way. Since I do not look unlike Grvill in the hairline department, Mr. Claudel gets a hat tip for an excellent casting choice!",1233792000,4,1010,4.704545454545454
3599643,5,B001GCUO6Q,"Philippe Claudel is brilliant!  His insight into women, relationships, life and love is accurate, artful and rich.  I loved the different themes that weave easily through this masterpiece, like confinement and prison; choices and consequences; things we easily miss in life; joy and hope even in grief; the past, the future and the power of the now.

There were a number of poignant one liners that expressed far more than the words themselves, like Michel's, 'Sometimes books have helped me more than people', or Juliette's, 'I wanted to go to prison.'

The close up facial shots and careful symbolism throughout the movie worked wonderfully to make it far more experiential than intellectual.  A friend who saw it with me said, 'I don't know what to think or say because I'm feeling so much.'  Beautiful leaden windows remind Juliette of more sinister prison bars. A chain spanning the floors of the residence symbolizes prisons at many levels, even at home. Rain falling on a sunlit window symbolize with alluring simplicity life and love beckoning - who can refuse?

I think this is without doubt the most impacting movie I've ever seen.  Granted it is slow moving, but the themes it deals with are themselves timeless and slow moving; they are not answerable to a fast paced world.",1233273600,9,1286,4.921296296296297

3599645,5,B001GCUO6Q,"While I've never been such a Philistine as to decline to see a film because it is in an unknown language and I'd have to read the subtitles, there is usually a sense of emotional distance when you have to read the words yourself. In the case of I've Loved You So Long, I felt no such distance. Indeed, this is the first time I've cried in a movie since... I don't know when. Sure, I am a callous bastard, but I often find myself moved by a film, only, rarely do I find myself as moved as I was by this one.

I've Loved You So Long focuses on the story of Juliette Fontaine coming from prison to live with her sister, who was a young adolescent when she was incarcerated. The tensions of living with an extended family are exacerbated by Juliette's personality, which it is accepted is altered by her time in gaol. Philippe Claudel's story is beautifully structured to release just as much information as is necessary to keep you interested, while retaining just enough mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat.

I have never seen a French film that I haven't liked, but I have also never seen a French film of this calibre. It is an outstanding piece of storytelling, full of pathos and charm.",1231804800,47,1197,4.339285714285714

Kristin Scott Thomas, in a quietly intense, brilliantly calibrated performance,  plays a  woman just freed after 15 years in prison for murder. Until  she can establish a new life, she is to  move in with the sister who never came to visit her in all those years  and the sister's family--a worried husband, two young adopted daughters and the husband's father, a stroke victim who can no longer talk. Soon a parole officer who dreams of visiting the Orinoco and a university colleague of the sister, who once taught in a prison, assume key roles as well. All these characters, even the little kids, come off as exceptionally real and interesting people.

  This is one of those movies that reveals itself slowly and stays with you for a long time. It plays on an emotional level that reminds me somewhat of ""Under the Sand,"" the Charlotte Rampling movie about the woman whose husband went for a swim and was never seen again. (Odd, kind of, that both are French movies that star  English actresses who've lived most of their adult lives in France.)",1231113600,102,1310,4.603448275862069

This is the story of two sisters.  Juliette, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, has just been released from prison after 15 years.  Her sister, Lea, played by Elsa Zylberstein, brings her into her home.  Lea is happily married and lives with her husband, their two adopted Vietnamese daughters, and her husband's father.  The husband is a little uncomfortable about Juliette staying with them because, as we slowly learn, she was imprisoned for murder.

Juliette is quietly stoic and, at the beginning, very uncomfortable with the family.  But Lea tries so hard and loves her so much that Juliette gradually softens as she starts to adjust to life outside of prison.  The relationship between the sisters is central to the film and it slowly evolves as more details of Juliette's crime come out.  Juliette starts adapting to life outside the prison; she gets a job; she has several male suitors; she helps her niece with her piano lessons and reads literature to Lea's father-in-law.

I sat through all this with a feeling of impatience.  What, exactly, was Juliette's crime?  Will she or won't she adapt to life outside the prison?  Why is the relationship between the sisters so strained?  I looked at my watch a lot but I couldn't do that too long because the film was in French and I had to read the titles.  I breathed a sigh of relief when everything finally got resolved and the film ended.

Don't get me wrong.  This is a fine film.  But I tend to like films that are faster paced and not quite so subtle.  I therefore do recommend it, especially for Francophiles.  But for everyone else it only gets a lukewarm recommendation.",1230076800,8,1852,4.624615384615384
3599649,4,B001GCUO6Q,"I've seen Kristin Scott Thomas in a number of French films before this one, and her command of the language has always seemed near native and most her characters ARE native Frenchwomen.  So I wondered why Philippe Claudel (or SOMEONE involved in the making of this film) felt compelled to make her character half-English, and someone who had spent a good portion of her childhood in Britain (longer, apparently, than her sister, played by French actress Elsa Zylberberg, whose accent is, one can assume, perceptibly ""Frenchier"").

Fans of the film might well ask why such a minor point would bug me so much.  Probably, it shouldn't.  Internationlism is one of the film's motifs.  Scott Thomas's character, Juliette Fontaine, is a recently released prisoner, who has completed a 15 year sentence for the murder of her six year old son.  Upon her release she takes up residence with her younger sister Lea, an academic who specializes in foreign literatures, who has adopted two Vietnamese children AND who is married to the son of Polish refugees.  ""A regular Benetton family,"" Lea jokes.

Added into the unique household blend is Lea's father-in-law, whose first language was also not French but, who more importantly, is now unable to speak at all, having suffered a series of strokes.  He still has his wits about him, however, and spends most of his time in his personal library, reading.

""Otherness"" is hardly unknown to this family, but what can be more ""other"" than having committed a heinous crime?  Despite Lea's hopes and best intentions, reintegration into family life--and into the larger society--is painfully difficult for Juliette.  At first, we even suspect it will be impossible.  But gradually--almost imperceptibly--Juliette begins to make that transition.  There are no truly dramatic breakthrough moments, although there are some telling ones (such as Juliette, who we learn is a former physician, coming to the medical aid of her somewhat skeptical--and suspicious--brother-in-law).

The love between the two long-estranged sisters would seem triumph in the end--if ""triumph"" is indeed the right word.  Their rapprochement, indeed Juliette's reasonably successful reintegration into larger society, is at best a ""small"" triumph.  There's not a lot of Sturm und Drang here. It is, in fact, a lot more like real life.  The sisters are initially wary and uncomfortable in each other's presence.  Luc, who has never known his sister-in-law is afraid that she might even be a threat to his two girls, and is reluctant to leave them in her care.

The changes that do come about are gradual and, therefore, more believable than they might otherwise have been. (I'm tempted to say, ""as they might have been in an American film,"" but I'm trying NOT to be a self-flagellating American filmgoer.)  Given the muted tone of the whole movie, though, I have to admit that I was somewhat perplexed by the ultimate revelations about the motivations behind Juliette's murder of her son. (And I will try to avoid being too much of a spoiler here.)

There are early indications that the murder was somehow linked to Juliette's painful divorce from her husband.  When we find out that there were other extenuating factors--ones that would probably make her crime no less punishable in the eyes of the law, but certainly understandable on a human level--it's almost something of a disappointment.  There had been, up until this revelation, a sense of mystery around this silent, stoic woman.  The impenetrability of evil is part of what hooks us about this film.

In the end, Juliette is proven not only to be ""not evil"" but actually, in her way, rather noble.  I may be in the minority here, but I think I might have preferred NOT ever being able to fathom the depths of her crime.  Learning that there were extenuating circumstances--ones that may or may not have reduced her sentence, if not actually have gotten her off--replaces a profound mystery with a rather lesser one.  Namely, why did she not share the truth of her situation with the courts, or at least her own family.

She says, at one point, that she WANTED to go to prison for her crime. That may well be her character's ""personal truth,"" and we pretty much have to accept that.  Fair enough.  But for me, there's something that rings a bit hollow here too.  When it does come out, the truth emerges quite accidentally.  Like everything else about the movie, the revelation is rather understated, and not all that satisfying dramatically.  Some viewers will no doubt welcome that: others may find themselves wondering if too much understatement is such a good thing.",1229126400,,4632,4.986979166666667

You knew she had a secret, not just from everyone in her sister's circle of friends, but from the viewer; and the viewer knows that revelation will come before it's over.  If I were to give it any criticism, I would say that it's that final revelation that left me scratching my head a little bit.

8304924,5,B001GCUO6Q,"It's true that this isn't for everyone. The movie is subtle and it speaks to the trauma caused by the loss of a child as well as by a long incarceration. As most viewers here have said Kristin Scott Thomas's acting is superb. The five stars is for the emotion her face alone stirred up in me. I wavered between four and five stars. It's not perfect, but it's so different than most movies, even most French movies, that I rounded up. The only part that seemed a bit phony to me was the way the little Vietnamese girl acted. She was overly cute and her lines seemed precious sometimes. The relationships with the cop and with the teacher were compelling. The plot didn't seem contrived to me. I mean, she felt responsible for his death because she gave birth to him. That's really what we're left with. It's beautifully shot, too, with elegiac hues and tones.",1513382400,2,858,4.471337579617835
