1220384,4,B00000IC7W,"Alright, this is a cheesy movie and there is too little of Marilyn Monroe to make it worth buying if that's all you're looking for (but she looks hot at 24-years-old and in a tight sweater). But it does have businessman John McFarland (played by Donald Crisp) giving one of the best pro-market speeches ever. It's on par with Danny DeVito's great speech in _Other People's Money_.",1212537600,2,380,4.686567164179104
1220385,2,B00000IC7W,"Check out the various versions on the Amazon search facility and you'll mostly see Marilyn featured as the main image on most of the DVD boxes, the reality is that she appears for less than five minutes and her dialogue could be read in about two.

I found my copy in a supermarket at such a low price that I wondered if anyone was making anything on it, they were of course.  The reason I bought it was the title and the fact that it was made in the early fifties and I was right, it does show everyday life in small-city USA.  You'll get to see middle class domestic housing, interior decor, fashions, buses, trains, planes (even a newspaper delivery boy on one of those Cushman motor scooters) and a simple homey story with a bit of economic theory chucked in as well...and that's it.

Without a photo of Ms Monroe on the front nobody would be interested (apart from me of course).  It will probably continue to be re-released every few years to attract another wave of new MM fans but it really should have been forgotten decades ago.",1142899200,9,1038,4.4136125654450264
1220386,5,B00000IC7W,"Hometown Story (1951) features Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles, and while Marilyn probably fuels most of the sells for this item, the movie itself is actually quite good in its own right. Jeffrey Lynn plays Blake Washburn, a newly un-elected state senator who returns home with quite an electoral chip on his shoulder. He's not above punching a guy for joking about the election, and even his old friends are likely to be met with a cold shoulder. Washburn takes over his uncle's newspaper, but all he cares about is starting an editorial crusade that will help him win his Senate seat back. Slim Haskins (a young Alan Hale, Jr. of Gilligan's Island fame), his best friend and lead reporter, grows increasingly frustrated at Washburn's politicized agenda, and even Washburn's long-suffering fiance Janice (Marjorie Reynolds) cannot get through to him, even when she threatens to call the whole thing off. Undaunted, Washburn rakes big business up and down the coals of his editorial pages, even after one local businessman, John McFarland (Donald Crisp), gives him an Economics 101 lecture on the importance of big business and its products in everyday life.

Then Washburn's little sister Katie (Melinda Plowman) enters an old mine to retrieve her new puppy and becomes the victim of a terrible cave-in. The wealthy Mr. McFarland comes to Katie's aid in a very big way, as does big business itself through a number of its mechanical and life-saving products. Hometown Story carries an important message, and it delivers this message in a quite moving and certainly entertaining manner. As for Marilyn Monroe, she plays Washburn's secretary Iris; it is by no means a large part, but she does appear in several scenes. Her acting skills are not very polished at this stage of her career, but she certainly accomplishes her main task of making tight sweaters look absolutely amazing. Alan Hale's character has the hots for Iris, and I cannot help but get a kick out of watching ""the Skipper"" trying to put the moves on Marilyn Monroe.",1127520000,,2044,4.941860465116279
1220387,4,B00000IC7W,"This is a film about media ethics. It shows that not all would-be muckrakers are right, that assumptions can be wrong. Objectivity in journalism is the theme of the story. Jeffrey Lynne plays Blake Washburn, a politician who has been defeated in a recent election. He returns to his hometown to edit the local newspaper. In the process, his subjectivity distorts his decision making.

Alan Hale, Jr. (the Skipper of ""Gilligan's Island) is a reporter working for Washburn who sees what is happening to his friend and boss. He tries unsuccessfully to help him see that he has a distorted view of reality. Washburn doesn't listen and continues to turn out negative content. He criticizes local businesses and one of the owners approaches him to discuss fairness.

In the end, Washburn's younger sister is saved by the very corporation he defamed. Washburn learns the error of his ways and changes. Marily Monroe is one of the secretaries. Alan Hale, Jr.'s character tries to get a relationship going with her, but doesn't make it happen. Overall this is a well done film.",1114560000,4,1068,4.895027624309392

1220389,4,B00000IC7W,"This two-tape set is a must for Marilyn Monroe completists everywhere. 1) The 1951 film ""Hometown Story"" stars Jeffrey Lynn as a bitter ex-politician who goes to work for his uncle's newspaper. Monroe has a small but very amusing and memorable role in the picture. 2) ""The Marilyn Monroe Story"" is one of the best documentaries about the legendary sex goddess ever put together. John Huston, who directed Marilyn in her first really well-known film(THE ASPHALT JUNGLE) as well as her last film(THE MISFITS), takes us on an incredible journey through this remarkable woman's life.",1023408000,6,579,5.105263157894737
1220390,3,B00000IC7W,"There seems to be some confusion here.  There are apparently two movies called Hometown Story.  One with Marilyn Monroe and one with John Wayne.  This is the one with Marilyn.
It was filmed early in her career and she only has a small role in it.  She plays the secretary to a newspaper editor that is trying to take down what he thinks is a corrupt businessman.  The story is a typical post-WWII melodrama and doesn't really have any hold any cinematic history other than casting Marilyn.
A must-have for the true Marilyn fan (in DVD, which is rare in the first place), other more popular movies might be better for the casual fan.
Another person to look for is Alan Hale Jr. as the veteran reporter.  He played the Skipper on Gilligan's Island years later and is very young here.
Overall, Marilyn fans and film buffs will enjoy, others may just find it boring.",982713600,3,862,4.529032258064516

Marilyn Monroe has a small but amusing part, and Alan Hale Jr. (the Skipper  from Gilligan's Island) is also in the film. Hale's character even flirts  with Marilyn a few times, but fails to woo her.",928108800,19,333,4.910714285714286
1220469,5,B00000IC7W,"I bought this for two main reasons: It was cheap and ""The Marilyn Monroe Story"" looked like it might have been something I've been wanting to see as a special feature for one of her movies but have yet to. ""Hometown Story"" didn't look very interesting so I wasn't very jazzed about it - I was merely hoping it wouldn't be a complete bore.

Turns out this double sided DVD packs two gems! There is barely any product info on the back, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that ""The Story of Marilyn Monroe"" seems to have been recorded and aired shortly after her death - there are snippets of interviews from people who knew her and worked with her, original footage from what were probably news reels, and her full performance of ""Happy Birthday"" (biographers were not kidding about that dress being sparkly!). I guess because of how she's been mythologized and portrayed, I was surprised that John Huston, the narrator (he also directed Monroe in her first and last movies), brought up her mental illness and drug addiction/dependence. This is only 50 minutes long, but worth every minute because they managed to pack in a lot of facts about her life; it's entirely in black and white, and you get the full benefit of 60's quality clips.

""Hometown Story"" is also in black and white, filmed in 1951, and is 61 minutes long. The back claims to star Marilyn Monroe, but she just has a minor supporting role (about the length of her role in ""All About Eve""). Generic synopsis: An ex politician returns home to expose, via his uncle's newspaper, big business for the corrupt [expletive] it is because he blames them for not being reelected. Someone offers a theory that proves that big business isn't so bad - basically - stop campaigning against us, you're affected our profits; this is actually an interesting theory that makes sense ... Anyway - of course something happens and big business is the reason his little sister is alive. [This is a spiced up version of what's on the back.] I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this little movie, even if the ending was a little corny.",1439078400,,2087,4.622641509433962

1220471,4,B00000IC7W,"The 10th Movie in which Marilyn appeared, not the ninth as the editorial review says. lol I am an avid MM fan and have been for many years since 1981. This movie was the first for her in 1951 and she had a small role as a secretary for a newspaper. The film makers of this one used her as nothing more than eye candy with the tight sweater and making smart remarks to a future ""skipper"" on Gilligan's Island. This edition by Laserlight, is probably the best edition out there. It's clean and has a few extras included rather than just the movie. I find the introduction by Tony Curtis interesting since his rant on Larry King Live about the ""kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler"" fiasco that got heated on the show. He said some things that were inaccurate on that one. It's on youtube. All in all a decent movie to have and a must if you are a diehard MM fan like me.",1406160000,,871,4.221556886227545
1220472,4,B00000IC7W,This is a really cute movie with a good storyline that won't blow your mind but it will hold your interest.  It's true that many wouldn't be interested in seeing it if it weren't for Marilyn Monroe being in it but the fact that it's a pleasant movie is a plus accompanied with her presence in the movie (she does a good job and looks great).  The movie is just a little over an hour long (about 70 minutes) and is worth watching if you're a Marilyn fan or if you just enjoy these old films with a simple plot and good storyline.,1395792000,,528,4.116504854368932
1220473,1,B00000IC7W,"The star was set up as a narcissist that didn't know his limitations.  He wanted to be a senator and help the working man.  He was supposedly voted out because he wasn't qualified. He decided to check out a big plant to see what they were dumping in the streams.  He was made out to be an idiot that was looking for trouble where there was none.  He next focused on the huge profits big business was making.  Again made to look the fool.  The rich business man saves his very young sister and in the end, big business is good for the public and huge factories do not pollute.  Blatant propaganda.

I hated this show.  Skipped through just to make sure I wasn't making something of nothing.  It was a big business propaganda movie very poorly done.",1394409600,,747,4.3478260869565215

SYNOPSIS--
Newly out-of-office Blake Washburn (Lynn) believes the son of a wealthy businessman tricked the electorate into voting for him. Blake uses his editor's position on the family newspaper to search for dirt on his victorious opponent. His columns attack the new senator and companies owned by the man's dad.

Blake's hostilities soon extend to local corporations. Star reporter Slim Haskins (Hale) doesn't like it and gets punished for saying so with menial story assignments. When Blake admits to fiance Janice Hunt (Reynolds) that he's broken a promise to work for the people and is using the paper only to get re-elected, she threatens to leave him. Slim and Blake argue and start throwing punches. Their personal business is interrupted by a visitor, plus news of a school outing tragedy involving Blake's kid sister.

Today's Republican Party would love this propaganda film. The hero comes home to run his hometown newspaper.

He's fed a different perspective: That the ""profit"" is really to the customer who uses the product. He rejects this idea until he discovers that his privileged status in the community allows him to benefit from corporate resources not available to the average citizen to save the life of a family member, at which point he decides this is a good thing and sells out.

A mining accident forces him to reconsider. In the newsroom we encounter a young Marilyn Monroe, whose few lines belie her great impact. She is eloquent, she's charming, and...yes, she's already a bombshell. The acting by all is good and the storyline is interesting--despite the excessive moralizing which ultimately turns profits from a villain to a needed friend. Just seeing Monroe is enough reason to watch this movie. 4 stars.",1475539200,,638,5.144230769230769

The story starts with a view of a city from an airplane. Those buildings look like a movie studio. Passengers deplane from a DC-3. A defeated state Senator doesn't like criticism, or the campaign tactics that defeated him. Blake Washburn returns home with a puppy for his young sister. He dines out with Janice. Blake will work for the local newspaper as the Editor. A boy delivers newspapers on a motor scooter. A school bus picks up children. [No local schools?] Another state passed a bill to end stream pollution. Does it happen here? [Note the trolley tracks in the street.] Iris has a message for Hoskins. People believe what they read in the `Fairfax Herald'. [Have you ever read a story about an incident that you knew about? How accurate was it?] The newspaper will investigate local stream pollution from factory discharges. Nothing is dumped into the river, the factory owner says so. A crusade will build up circulation. Katie will go on a field trip. People comment on a successful business. Blake gets an idea. ""Business Profits Too High"" is the headline. This causes a higher cost of living. ""Who Gets the Big Profits?""

Circulation is up. [A hidden agenda?] Katie got a list of names. Is Blake using his newspaper to get back to the State Senate? ""What's wrong with trying to get votes?"" Was his election as a war hero a mistake? School children go on a bus to visit Copper Hill. John McFarland visits Editor Washburn for a talk. He explains how business works, the buyer gets value for what he bought. Is being Big also Bad? McFarland explains what is good. That school bus goes into a dangerous area. [Whose idea was this?] That puppy runs into a cave, Katy and Allen follow. There is a cave-in! Can they remove that load of rocks and dirt with a bulldozer? They call a doctor and more help to clear away the fallen debris. Katie is rescued alive! But she needs an immediate operation. The ambulance races to the airport to fly Katie to the hospital. The resuscitator supplies oxygen to Katie. Another ambulance carries Katie to the hospital. Will the operation save her? [Successful movies need a happy ending.] A lot of things saved Katie. Blake writes a new editorial. Has he learned something?

There was a famous event around 1950 in the Los Angeles area when a young girl was trapped in a hole in the ground. This may have inspired this movie. Would a local newspaper attack a local industry that has big payroll that supports local small businesses that advertise in the local newspaper? No, because of the power of local society or the ruling class. An industry that provides a lot of jobs will be treated with due respect. I once read that the job of a movie critic on a local newspaper was to recommend the products shown at the theaters that advertised in the paper. This movie makes a point that a decorated war hero may not make a good politician. Was this a comment on a current situation?",1467072000,,2949,4.613333333333333

7909884,3,B00000IC7W,"HOME TOWN STORY is clearly designed as a propaganda film extolling American values of free enterprise and capitalism, that not only make money but work for everyone's benefit.  In a long speech the British-born Donald Crisp, a veteran MGM contract artist, has the chance to tell bullying newspaper editor Blake Washburn (Jeffrey Lynn) about the folly of attacking big business people, especially when it is the same business people that ultimately save Blake's little sister Katie (Melinda Plowman) from death.  In light of recent scandals about capitalists making astronomical profits at their workers' expense, such sentiments seem a bit rich now; but at the time the film was released (1951), it was most likely perceived as a vindication of American values at the height of the so-called ""Red Scare.""

Of perhaps more lasting value is the film's depiction of the kind of small town values that seldom exist today.  Suburbanization had yet to begin; and most residents of Washburn's town live close to the center.  The main street is thronged with people; and the newspaper (which Washburn edits) not only sells well but includes stories of mostly local interest.  Everyone knows everyone else, and try their best to look out for one another.  When Washburn embarks on his campaign to discredit big business, he offends many of his fellow-workers, who believe that he is somehow undermining small town values.  Slim Haskins (Alan Hale Jr.), his faithful sidekick, goes so far as to threaten resignation.

In this safe environment gender roles are clearly delineated; the men go out to work while the women look after the home.  Blake's mother (Barbara Brown) spends her time cooking meals and keeping the home clean; while the men bravely rescue her daughter from a collapsed gold-mine, she stands on the periphery looking worried.  Direct action is not really her sphere of interest.

Writer/ director Arthur Pierson's script is largely predictable, but does have the virtue of pace: a lot happens during the film's sixty-five minute running-time.  Marilyn Monroe has a cameo role as a buttoned-up secretary politely resisting Slim's advances, but she makes little impression on the viewer's consciousness.

HOME TOWN STORY is the kind of mild entertainment that was expected of a second feature at the time - not particularly good, but not particularly bad either, especially for anyone interested in Fifties domestic sociology.",1462579200,,2433,5.205128205128205
7909885,3,B00000IC7W,This film is about a guy who runs a newspaper and tries to use his articles that he writes to garner the favor of voters so maybe he can be elected in the future after a failed political campaign. Marilyn monroe has a small role in this film and she gives a great performance. The little girl in this film is so sweet and adorable. Its terrible what happens to her but at least she survives. Good acting and a decent story make this film above average. The film is a little too preachy but it can be excused due to the subject matter. Mildly recommended.,1459036800,,554,4.235849056603773
