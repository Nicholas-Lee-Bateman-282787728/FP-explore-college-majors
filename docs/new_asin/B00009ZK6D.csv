It claims Kano is shown performing kata, this is correct but the entire time Kano is seen on this footage is no more than 30 to 40 seconds. The rest of the video is taken up with still shots of recycled photographs and lousy video. Take my advice and give this one a wide berth.",1101600000,8,361,4.013888888888889
