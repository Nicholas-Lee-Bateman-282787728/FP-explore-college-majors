4383931,5,B004I4KR1G,"A co-worker of mine got me hooked on this series with his Sirius radio.  I copied the files to a USB drive and play them whenever I am in the vehicle.  Good, clean, family appropriate entertainment for those long drives.",1387929600,,220,4.475
4383932,4,B004I4KR1G,"This collection contains over 700 episodes and is definitely best thing money can buy.  I had purchased other classic radio CDs like ""suspense"", which only contain 20 episodes for twice the money.  The recording, however, not very good on all episodes, some of them are barely audible (I say about 15% of them).  I just simply skip those and go on to the next story.  I mostly like Bob Bailey's stories anyway and they are all crystal clear.  The ""fuzzy"" ones are mainly from other earlier artists where recording technologies were not so advance.

The only drawback is this CD does not play in my car's system.  All files are in mp3 format so I simply load them into my ipod and play it from there in my car.  I highly recommend this CD.",1380758400,2,738,4.455223880597015
4383933,5,B004I4KR1G,I had been hacking around looking for Johnny Dollar mp3s and just decided it would be a good idea to spend a couple of bucks to get them all on one DVD.  I was not disappointed!!  This is a must-have for Johnny Dollar fans.,1376092800,4,223,4.045454545454546
4383934,5,B004I4KR1G,"Wow, what a collection.  Great value, and shipped promptly.

4383935,5,B004I4KR1G,"What a GREAT collection!  Old-time radio at it's best.  Travel across the US with Johnny Dollar, enjoying the characters and prices of items of the time.  I use these to relax and fall asleep by, one gets so caught up by the stories and descriptions, takes your mind off of everything as you head back in time.  I now sleep like a baby every night!  Disks arrived exactly as described, very happy!",1359072000,2,397,4.458333333333333
4383936,5,B004I4KR1G,"OnesMedia.com sent the 2 disk set right away. Ordering was easy, they went out of their way to describe that the files were MP3 and would not just play in a CD player. I downloaded all files to my computer and onto a music player. Everything worked perfectly! They even sent an additional set of radio shows as an unexpected bonus ""thank you"" for first order. I highly recommend. & Johnny Dollar rocks.  Be aware that many of the early shows were 5 part series. so don't go by the episode # just pick the first of similar titles and the entire story plays out.  THANKS Onesmedia!",1344297600,12,579,4.401869158878505
4383937,4,B004I4KR1G,"my Dad calls them sleepers: movies and shows that were really good, but didn't get great press or publicity.  This is one.  On air for more than a decade, by one measure, it surpasses Lucille Ball and Star Trek (TOS).  Johnny Dollar is a scruffy insurance investigator that winds up trading knuckles like Sam Spade.  Get it for fun.  Get it for history. Get it for those long road trips across New Ariztexicansas.",1317254400,5,413,4.602739726027397
