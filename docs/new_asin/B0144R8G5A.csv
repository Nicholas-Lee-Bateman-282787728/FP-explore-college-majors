7382913,5,B0144R8G5A,"I grew up listenting to and loving all types of guitar music. The payers, the instruments the history all entrance me. So many great stories to tell and so many ways to coax, cajole, beg, bend, stroke, stum and thump an instrument in order to produce evocative sound that moves man's soul. Robert Radler, the production team, Kevin Bacon and the guitar players from all walks of life did a fantastic job of illustrating both the guitar's history and what it can do for music. The film is well filmed and edited, blending together each palyer's story along with some history and some beutiful music that essentially moves multiple narratives forward seamlessly.",1458432000,2,660,4.901785714285714

Only problem is when playing,  at the end of each chapter it goes back to menu & you have to select the next chapter. I've tried it on 3 different dvd players, all the same. Never had a dvd do this. Very annoying & really would like to know if anyone else had this problem.",1456358400,,338,4.2

7382921,5,B0144R8G5A,"Great movie!

First off, let's just state for the record that there's no way anyone is going to make a movie that covers the entire history of the guitar in under two hours.  I mean, my personal favorites, the Gibson SG and the Fender Jaguar barely got mentioned.

Also, like other reviewers have pointed out, this video centers primarily around Fender and Gibson, with a short piece about the Line 6 Variax near the end.  You'll see a variety of other manufacturers' guitars being played within the video - the occasional Music Man, an Ibanez or two, a Reverend, a Danelectro here and there, an EVH, Gretsch, etc... - but the video does not go into detail on these company's instruments.

For example, you'll see a clip of Albert Lee playing his signature model Music Man, but he doesn't talk about it.  He talks about his 50's Telecaster during the Telecaster portion of the video.  Another example, you'll see Jerry Cantrell holding a Les Paul and talking about it during his interviews, but the video has no mention at all about his G&L models.

Other popular manufacturers like ESP, Schecter, Mosrite, etc...don't get a mention at all, which I find forgivable because of the 'historical documentary' context.  You may 'see' a Mosrite hanging up in the background while an interviewee is talking, but nobody says anything about it.  Much the same for most of the other guitars that you'll see in this video that are not Fender, Gibson, or Line 6.  A brief mention of Ed Roman's guitar work would have been incredible to see.

Personally, this doesn't bother me because the video was fun to watch and very entertaining, but another reviewer did mention these things and I feel inclined to agree with him/her.  This documentary would have to be several hours long to cover all of it.

The video is great at showing people of all walks of life enjoying the instrument, which I think is pretty central to the overall theme.  There are a number of high-level, virtuoso, and legendary players featured.  I also really appreciated seeing the interview clips with Seymore Duncan.  Seeing as how the electric guitar would not exist without pick-ups, it's nice to see a pick-up legend on the guest list.

I've never been a huge Kevin Bacon fan.  I don't dislike the guy, I just don't follow his catalog.  That said, he was a great choice to host the show.

All in all, it was a very fun video to watch and most guitar nuts will probably enjoy watching this at least once.  If you're not into guitars, I don't know what is wrong with you.",1507420800,,2531,4.653153153153153
7382922,3,B0144R8G5A,"Pretty good documentary overall, but lacking in a very key areas.  The first thing I was struck by immediately was the terrible quality sound!  For a production all about guitars and tone it sounded like the audio was sent through a crap little practice amp.  It was striking how hollow and amateur the entire audio track was.  Pretty disappointing.  I also thought it focused far too much on the usual suspects of Tele, Strat and Les Paul. There was no mention of the tremendous contributions and advancements made by companies like Ibanez, Charvel/Jackson, Kramer, Music Man, Schecter, etc... and the brilliant collection of instruments that came out of the Matsumoko factory in the 70s and 80s.  (to all you collectors, find a Daion, you won't be disappointed!)  I also found the selection of musicians a bit lacking, but at least there were a few great players mentioned that were not the cliche go-to guys.",1506643200,,911,4.876623376623376

This is it. Turn it up is certainly interesting for guitar lovers like myself. There is quite a bit of information on the history of guitars. Fender vs. Gibson, and other guitars. G.A.S., Digital guitars, etc.. Plenty of guitarists talk about their love to the instrument. It's fun and informative.

Of course, there are shortcomings: Ibanez and many other companies aren't even mentioned, nor are many guitar greats, such as Frank Zappa, Eddie Van Halen, Greg Howe, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Shawn Lane, etc....., but I guess that's for another time.

PQ: There is quite a bit of vintage footage, which is of far lesser quality, of course, but the newly shot elements, which comprise the bluk of the documentary look great, and there aren't any annoying compression-related artifacts that I can remember. Pleasing.

AQ: This is really more of a stereo track with a bit of ambience in the rears, but at no point does this feel like a discrete surround mix, which is a bit of a pity. The music doesn't have the punch as it should have IMHO, but it's adequately presented. It could be better though.

Extras: There is a bonus DVD (Yuck) with the longer interviews and a few interesting docs on RKS guitars (Gorgeous!), and Seymor Duncan pickups, which are certainly interesting. The PQ is actually not too bad. Too bad it's not a BD though, but better than nothing.

Get this if you are interesting in guitars, or if you are a guitarist like me, who can never have enough of these beauties.

Highly recommended, despite its shortcomings.",1468454400,2,1764,5.327338129496403

7382940,4,B0144R8G5A,"I liked the film, so I kept it, even with playback issues.  You can only watch the movie chapter by chapter instead of straight through, as is possible  with, well, every other DVD that you've ever watched.  I saw another review indicating same problem.  The first time I saw the film was on public television during a pledge drive.  This particular channel seems to have a pledge drive every other week and on days ending in Y..

IF this DVD copy was designed for TV broadcast, showing the movie chapter by chapter would have its advantages.  Easy to have the movie pause, and, enable your viewers to send money for the pledge drive.  .

You will enjoy this film if you love guitars.  GAS has another connotation in this film, and it has nothing to do with purchases at the petrol station or an upset stomach from opting for those tacos at the same locale as the place you purchased petrol. I enjoyed Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter's presentation of ""America the Beautiful"".  Good film!  .",1460764800,,979,4.563218390804598

My wife got it for me and, despite the less-than-impressive cover, it's very well done. It covers some of the history and technical aspects of the electric guitar, but mostly it's about the soul of the guitar and why people are drawn to the instrument.
