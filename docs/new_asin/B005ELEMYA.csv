8641677,4,B005ELEMYA,"I was hesitating whether i give it 3 stars or 4 stars. To start with,you must like this kind of mexican movies,i do. I've seen already some,but some are really bad. This one has a storyline,don't expect a fantastic movie,anyway i could look without boring till the end. The story is about a despute of land,a pretty common and important subject in mexico,i guess. I like everything what is a little bit informative about situations in a country and this one did. Nice girls (depends on your taste) and not too bad acting,that's why i give it 4 stars.",1337558400,,550,4.565656565656566
