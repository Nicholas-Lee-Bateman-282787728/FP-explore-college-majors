7788211,5,0736060316,"High-Powered Plyometrics (DVD) by Jim Radcliffe is intended for use by serious athletes and coaches who wish to learn Plyometrics and the necessary progressions to proceed through a program safely from a guru of performance ehancement. This is not intended for the recreational athlete who is looking for an exercise video.  To truly understand the proper progressions behind the demonstrations, I would also recommend purchasing his book (of the same name) and Functional Training for Athletes at All Levels. I have attended trainings with Jimmy Radcliffe and have found him to be extremely knowledgeable as well as capable of demonstrating the exercises from his book.  If you are looking for a well-produced DVD which illustrates the high-powered exercises from his orginal book, then this is definitely for you.",1179446400,18,815,5.359375
7788212,3,0736060316,"I never actually used this video.  I thought it would be like other fitness videos I own, which are suitable for following in one's living room.  This one is not.  It mostly shows you outdoor excercises, some of which require special equipment.  I don't doubt that it is a quality video, but it is not what I had in mind at all.",1162080000,20,328,4.241935483870968
