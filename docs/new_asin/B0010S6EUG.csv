3049662,5,B0010S6EUG,"Let me not talk about the technical mastery and excellent (Ghanian) African percussion and Jazz displayed herein... Instead  wish to focus on the fun present in this presentation not only could you tell the audience had a blast but the love and joy expressed by the performers of this music is evident and infects you and moves you to shake your body!

I often find it ironic that many of Wynton  Marsalis' detractors accuse him of being too classical making Jazz antiquated and stifling the creativity in Jazz because of his refusal to accept or acknowledge smooth Jazz, electronic fusion and free and advant garde Jazz I don't personally listen extensively to those forms but his detractors also say by his blunt decision to go only as for as bebop and its derivative forms he lacks true creativity and wishes to make Jazz a 'museum' piece to them I say TAKE THIS AND CALL ME IN MORNING

The music created here and played is fresh, inventive, informative fun and SWINGINGGGGGGGGGG whether it be ODADDA! or the JALC or the call and response exhibited when the two groups play together.

Lastly while I was clearly never born in the period of which this suite Congo Square was written I find myself taken there hearing the drums, seeing and feeling what it must of be like to express your freedom in the only available safe venue

This is the true function of music to enlighten to uplift and to enjoy.

Well done JALC and Odadaa!",1213401600,5,1430,4.628458498023716
3049663,5,B0010S6EUG,"If you've got blood in your veins, Congo Square will move it. This collaboration of Jazz at Lincoln Center and Ghanaian percussion ensamble Odadaa! boils with intensity from start to finish, a fitting tribute to Congo Square, once a tiny island of release for the slaves of New Orleans.

The cinematography is basic, but who cares? You don't have to watch the screen. The mix of African sounds and American jazz conjures the tumult, the chatter, and the dancing with compelling drums, horns, and here and there a vocal or spritz of sparkling piano. Congo Square is a crowd scene rather than a showcase for soloists, including Marsalis. Maybe closer to Gershwin than typical big band sounds.

This music is an accessible and exuberant achievement, a tonic for the pop weary. It richly deserves an audience.",1208131200,8,805,4.911764705882353
3049664,5,B0010S6EUG,"It took two great and unique musicians - the African drummer Yacub Addy and Wynton Marsalis - to blend Ghanaian percussion and songs  with jazz forms on this level.  The result is amazing.  This is a culturally historic masterwork, but it's also some of the most dynamic and hot music you've ever heard - it lifts the spirit and moves the body.

Each of the musicians of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and Yacub Addy's ensemble Odadaa! have made a great effort and the love shows.

This concert was the opening event of the 2007 Montreal Jazz Festival, and comes at the end of the second national tour of the music.

8238243,5,B0010S6EUG,"I am so tired of having arguments about Wynton Marsalis. His critics say the same things:
a. He is just an amalgam of Ellington, Mingus and Post-Bop quasi modernism as a composer with no voice of his own..... and without the ability to write something as infectious, melodic and timely as Sophisticated Lady, In A Sentimental Mood, Rockin' In Rhythm etc etc.
b. As an instrumentalist he's brought nothing new to the Trumpet being an amalgam of Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Roy Eldridge, Fats Navarro and Satchmo (a pretty great mix of people if you ask me) with the technical ability to play Haydn (is there another trumpeter ever that combined these extraordinary qualities???---I doubt it and if there is one we don't know about him).
c. As a pedagogue and thinker he is a pure reactionary conservative who is the equivalent of a walking museum piece in need of a paint job.

Forgive my language but this is complete horses***. I was also somewhat tough on him back in his early days when he was very militant about what was real american music and what wasn't, when it was a certain kind of ""Jazz"" invented between 1890 and May 1974 or nothing at all. I stopped listening to him after Black Codes for about a decade. I then heard Big Train on PBS and have kept abreast of his music making since then. Yes, his lyric writing is awkward at times and he pushes so much of what he does toward the sometimes bloated long form work with a strain for profundity at all costs.

ALL OF THAT SAID, this man is an absolute treasure. At his best, in pieces like the back half (Sweet Embrace of Life onwards) of In This House, On This Morning or Loose Duck and Sunflowers from the often incandescent Marciac Suite, he makes absolutely committed, joyous, brilliant, stunning, virtuosic and deep music. So much of Big Train absolutely killed me and the Live at The Village Vanguard with the Septet?? Incredible. Yes, Duke is everywhere. Who cares?? It's good to have that man's work alive with us living within the work of SOMEBODY. We have way too many Gil Evans clones and big band writers who can sing every intro and outro Billy May and Nelson Riddle wrote on those amazing Sinatra records. What about Duke and Mingus?? Who is carrying that tradition forward??? Nobody but Wynton Marsalis. What Wynton's music has which is absent in so many other writers is: roots music, work songs, the blues and by blues I mean Blind Willie McTell and Blind Willie Johnson, early New Orleans practitioners, folk music, folk music, FOLK MUSIC!! Watching Congo Square and something like his 2010 performance of ""Sunflowers"" at the Marciac Jazz Festival fills me with gratitude, joy and abiding love of this music. The JALC band sounds amazing. It is just great writing, great playing and music that should be heard by a lot more people. The detractors have got to chill and just admit that this man cares so much and is doing magnificent work. Bravo Wynton and thank you!

Listen to the last 15 years of music making in Ellington's life?? It is not all genius, but it is all him. Not every second of late Miles is great. Musicians are human and flawed like everyone else. Yes, you have Shakespeares, Beethovens and Stravinskys that seem incapable of weak work (anyone read Pericles, Prince of Tyre recently though?) Listen to Wynton's Citi Movement, Vitoria Suite, Big Train, The Magic Hour, Live At The House Of Tribes, Live at the Vanguard, and this wonderful Congo Square. May this man make a lot more music before he leaves us. I hear a voice there and an individual one. I hear Wynton. I can tell its him and only him from both a writing and playing standpoint. I am profoundly grateful for him.",1420329600,,3693,4.643730886850153

8238249,5,B0010S6EUG,"Although I'm not a big fan of African music this collaboration between Marsalis-lead JALC (Jazz at the Lincoln Center) big band and Odadaa!, an absolutely remarkable group of Ghanese (Ghanian?) musicians; mostly percussionists and singers; is something special...
The title refers to the slave-market but you don't really have to know that to feel the swing and drive of these performances, but also the warm emotion projected particularly from the Odadaa!'s lead singer...

And yes, all those who think that Marsalis is conservative or narrow-minded should check out this gloriuos dvd. Two hours of first class music that transcends boundaries of time and space, connecting not only African and American music and musicians (not all the JALC members are Black) but also various styles of jazz and other types of (African) American music.

And Wynton is a true leader of his group, not hogging the spotlight, giving ample space for his band's stars (for instance, Marcus Printup is one of the trumpeters), but still demonstrating the impressive range and expressiveness of his playing (Cootie Williams meets Clifford Brown). Wynton's solos (as well as the collaborations with Yacub Addy and JALC musicians) is quite remarkable.",1229558400,2,1227,5.319587628865979
