1827855,5,B000087F0V,"Eric Schweig, in one of his best roles since ""Last of the Mohicans"" plays dedicated cop and shadow-vigilante Rudy, while trying to holding his family together, including his alcoholic brother Mogie (Graham Greene in a critically underrated performance). Filmed entirely on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, viewers get a sense of the deep bindings of family in Lakota culture along with the deplorable living conditions perpetrated by decades of broken promises and abuse from the American government. Highly recommend, and prepare to be moved.",1098662400,13,554,5.453488372093023
1827856,5,B000087F0V,"Shortly after receiving my driver's license I decided to take a road trip through Nebraska. At one point in my journey I suddenly noticed Indians everywhere--driving down the road, sitting in parking lots off the state highway, and standing in front of decrepit looking buildings. ""What's going on here?"" I said to myself, not knowing at the time that I was cruising through the Winnebago reservation in Northern Nebraska. I always tell this story to friends nowadays, especially ones who champion Native American rights, and it never fails to get a laugh. Why? Because they know most of us rarely encounter Indians, let alone spend any time on reservations. Out here in the Midwest, you will still meet Native Americans from time to time outside of reservations. If you live on the East or West Coast of the United States, however, you probably have little interaction with Indians. Oh, you might have seen one on a college campus, or know someone who knows someone who has some ""Indian blood"" flowing through their veins, but most Americans have only seen Indians in old photographs or on television. In short, we have little idea about the plight of the modern day Native American. That's why a movie like ""Skins"" is an important piece of cinema that all of us should watch.
""Skins"" focuses on two brothers living on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, just down the road from Mount Rushmore. Pine Ridge is the poorest county in the United States, rife with chronic alcoholism, high infant mortality rates, sky-high unemployment, and low life expectancies. It's a rough place to live and raise a family, a fact Pine Ridge police officer Rudy Yellow Lodge learns anew everyday as he deals with murders, assaults, rapes, and other alcohol and poverty induced rampages. When he isn't fulfilling his duties, he's attempting to deal with his alcoholic older brother Mogie, a Vietnam veteran who always likes to stir up some trouble on the reservation. But Rudy has more problems than putting up with his brother. The police officer is sick to his soul about the abhorrent conditions on the reservation, and one day he decides to do something about it. What Yellow Lodge does is perhaps a series of small gestures, merely a drop of remedy in an ocean of social sickness, but he feels it is good for his sanity and good for his people.
What Rudy does is turn vigilante. The idea comes to him after he falls and hits his head on a rock while pursuing a fugitive in a murder case. From this point forward, Yellow Lodge wreaks havoc on Lakotas who assault their fellow Lakotas. He beats two youths with a baseball bat, breaking their knees in the process, after he learns about their involvement in a heinous crime. A bigger mission concerns the liquor stores in Whiteclay, Nebraska. Since alcohol sales on the reservation are a big no-no, Indians drive down to Whiteclay to buy their poison. Yellow Lodge rapidly tires of seeing his people buy booze at the stores, so he decides to torch one of the businesses in the middle of the night. Like I said, it's a small gesture that won't mean much in the long run (other stores will open for business in the morning as sure as the sun rises), but taking an extreme action makes Rudy feel good about himself. After all, he's a cop sworn ""to serve and protect"" his people, and what better way to fulfill this promise than to strike a blow against the individuals who make his people's lives miserable. There's a problem with Rudy's willful actions, though. For one thing, they don't entirely embody Lakota virtues. Also, even the best actions have a tendency to hurt the ones we love, and the results of the fire at the liquor store nearly destroy Rudy Yellow Lodge's life.
The performances in ""Skins"" are excellent. Director Chris Eyre assembled a largely Indian cast for his film, and they all do a good job. Eric Schweig works wonders as the emotionally conflicted Rudy Yellow Lodge. He's so riveting to watch that you immediately feel an empathy with his character even when the guy does some bad things. For the role of Mogie, Eyre cast none other than Graham Greene. A character that is a raging alcoholic with a serious authority problem might not be the easiest role to pull off, but Greene does it with an effortlessness that is startling to watch. Both of these characters move against the backdrop of a reservation clogged with run down houses and shacks, rutted roads, and broken lives. If you think everything is doom and gloom in ""Skins,"" however, you're wrong. Eyre injects the film with an enormous amount of humor, which might come as a surprise. Many people don't associate Native Americans with a sense of humor because they've seen old black and white photos of stone faced Indians awkwardly posing for the camera. ""Skins"" shows that Indians use humor in part to cope with their difficulties.
It is difficult to watch ""Skins"" and not feel pity for the residents of Pine Ridge, but Eyre is attempting something more with his picture. Instead of trying to get us to feel sorry for the Lakotas, he wants his audience to know about their problems and how Lakotas live their lives in spite of them. I applaud Chris Eyre for gracing us with this amazingly insightful film about a world far too few of us know about. ""Skins"" is fascinating, funny, thought provoking, and even--surprise--entertaining. Add this one to your rental/buy list posthaste.",1077580800,38,5406,4.764392324093817

1827858,5,B000087F0V,"Tremendous movie;too bad most people will never see it. This movie portrays life as it really is for many natives on the reservation-not life at all but an existence. This movie is about as accurate as I've seen portraying the reality of the problems of Native Americans. The portrayal of drunks pathetically hanging in front of the liquor store I've seen in reality in Utah and Wyoming. This is a must see movie. If you think you're doing badly,this is a solid reminder that some people live a lifetime worse than most people's worst days. They are a proud people that aren't looking for your sympathy-but they'd appreciate awareness.",1060473600,7,635,4.834862385321101
1827859,4,B000087F0V,"I recently saw this film and must say that it has become one of my all-time favorite movies, solely for the realisitic portrayal it gives of today's reservations.
Contrary to the report given by an earlier reviewer, Pine Ridge is in SOUTH Dakota, not North.  I grew up in South Dakota nearly all my life, and I taught at an Indian school. I saw, sometimes first hand, what the reservation life entailed, and it was depressing.  This movie does a good job of encompassing one of the reservation's most prevalent threats at this time:  alcoholism.
I've been a fan of Graham Greene ever since Dances With Wolves, although I don't consider that movie a stellar example of historically accurate film making.
For the past few years, I've read about the debate regarding the liquor stores in White Clay,  NE.  Although I realize that those people may be making a tidy profit off the Indians in Pine Ridge, people must realize that alcoholics will drive ANY distance to get their booze -- White Clay and further.  You cannot blame the store owners for providing the booze.  You're blaming the wrong people.
For those who don't see the significance of the bear trap scene:  I think it is a statement about the current climate of the reservations, the way native people turn against each other in today's depressing reservations.  The alcoholism has brought in crime and distrust among the people of the reservations, and it's startling to see the decline.
I gave this film 4 out of 5 stars only because I found the scenes with the main character (Eric Schweig) having an affair as distracting and not relevant.  It seems to me as if there should have been more to that story, but there wasn't.
All in all, I would highly recommend this story to anyone interested in Native American history, or in the history of the United States in general.",1059955200,21,1832,4.696875
1827860,4,B000087F0V,"Skins is powerful.... Graham Greene is wonderful. Skins is a story not only of the disintegration and degredation of a once powerful people, but a story of two brothers rocky relationship with each other. Mogie, (Graham Greene) is the stereotypical ""drunk indian"" portrayed PERFECTLY by Greene. Graham... you are Oscar worthy for this one!  Eric Schweig plays his straight edged, save the rez-from itself, policeman brother (Rudy),that is disgusted by what his brother has become- not to mention the monotonous domestic violence calls he gets due to drug abuse and alcoholism on the reservation.
 Chris Eyre has intecritly drawn it together to make sense to all people.  I saw Smoke Signals, and I can definately tell that Eyre has matured in his directing ability.  I don't think Smoke Signals was half the movie of Skins.
There was some less than perfect camera angles and the end was a little abrupt.  Its almost like Eyre lost his focus a few times- in other words, storys would just stop when they got started.  (like the murdered man in the beartrap... I expected to hear more about that??)  I think I understand why he did that though, he was trying to show bits and pieces of all the tragedies of reservation life to give Rudy a reason to go on his vigilante rampage, at least thats what I think. Possibly, he wanted to show such a variety of unlawfullness that Rudy was turned into something of a reservation superhero, only to backfire when he almost kills his brother in one of his escapades.
All in all, this movie was touching in one aspect, rough in another, funny in bits and pieces, moving all the way through, and most importantly... real.  Keep up the good work Chris!",1058832000,8,1686,4.73037542662116
1827861,4,B000087F0V,"This 2002 film takes place on the Pine Ridge Reservation in North Dakota.  It's a sad place, steeped in poverty and alcoholism. The camera brings us into the dilapidated homes and shows us the barren terrain.  And the Director, Chris Eyre, has wisely chosen an all-Native cast.  Don't be fooled by their Anglican sounding names.  They're all Indians, either from America or Canada.
The story is about two brothers in their late forties.  One is a cop and the other is a burnt-out alcoholic who sometimes thinks he's still in Vietnam.  Flashbacks show their abusive childhood and their dependence on one another.  The storyline shows us how Eric Schweig, cast as the cop brother, helps his brother over and over again.  Graham Greene is cast as the alcoholic and even though we see him mostly drunk and creating chaos for everyone, get to know him as a real person with hopes and dreams and missteps along the way.
We learn about life on the reservation and the history of the massacre at Wounded Knee.  And we also learn why the Mt.  Rushmore carving of the four American presidents is so upsetting to the Indians who see rocks as sacred.  As the story moves along, we see the cop brother become a vigilante and solve a murder investigation.  Later, he sets a liquor store on fire.  When his brother is burned in the fire, the story comes to a pivotal point and we get a glimpse of the unwavering love of the brothers for each other and the sense of family in the entire community.
This is a thoughtful movie that's a bit uncomfortable to watch.  It left me sad and pensive.  And yet it taught me something too.  Recommended.",1054857600,79,1625,4.570934256055363
1827862,3,B000087F0V,"My thoughts are torn over ""Skins,"" one of the few films to chronicle the sad, wasted lives of Native Americans and the bloody history that has informed the misfortunes of nearly an entire culture.
 Directed by Chris Eyre, the movie undeniably has powerful scenes, not the least of which is the closing image, which involves a debasement of Mount Rushmore.
For me, the lasting image from ""Skins"" is the sight of a local (Gary Farmer) killed by a bear trap set by neighbors. A disbelieving reservation cop (Eric Schwieg) wants an explanation for it -- the bear trap, why nobody answered the obvious calls for help -- and there is none. Not plausible, anyway. So many of the Natives' problems have their roots in something, whether it be a history of abuse or lack of opportunities, but they do not justify much of the mindlessness that has invaded the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
Eyre knows that, and to prove his point he makes that cop, Rudy Yellow Lodge, a vigilante who beats criminals and burns down Nebraska liquor shops in his off hours. His efforts, essentially, are just as fruitless as anything else: The drunks still get drunk, the reservation remains mostly hopeless, and the brutal past cannot be changed.
Which brings me to the other side of my thoughts: ""Skins,"" while powerful, is poorly made. The editing, the documentary-style camerawork, some of the acting -- it's simply left wanting. Given the subject matter on the table, the absolute dead-in-the-eye importance of it, it probably sounds like quibbling to criticize production values. Nevertheless, I mention it, because it stands in the way of a better film. You look at ""The Fast Runner,"" an amazing achievement shot on a similar small budget in far harsher conditions, and you get an idea of what ""Skins"" is lacking. ""The Fast Runner"" is a masterpiece film generations will return to. Some have hailed ""Skins"" that way, and it'd be nice if that were true, but the proof isn't on the print.
 When ""Skins"" does work, it's usually because Graham Greene is onscreen. Greene is Rudy's older brother, Mogie, a relentless-if-remorseful drunk, a failed promise apparently wrecked by a tour in Vietnam. He ambles around the package stores just across the border in Nebraska when he's not working his brother into a frenzy; the fun ends when Rudy torches a liquor store while Mogie's inside trying to left some booze.
 That happens at the halfway point, and ""Skins"" then shifts into nothingness. The bear trap scene aside, not a lot happens in the movie's final half -- Rudy and Mogie acknowledge the big fire, but never work themselves up over it, while Mogie tries to make peace with his teenage son (Noah Watts). Basically, the last 30 minutes are an elongated ""final days"" sequence for Greene.
 The final scene is the attention-getter most remember. I admit, it's well-conceived, but the execution of it is amateurish. If you understand editing, you'll wonder why, when the movie's only amazing camera shot is revealed, this shot lasts, at most, two seconds. It aptly sums up ""Skins,"" a movie with a lot to say, and poor visual strategies in which to tell it.",1050537600,8,3138,4.848880597014926
1827863,4,B000087F0V,"Chris Eyre's second feature, ""Skins,"" takes a hard, unswerving  look at the harsh conditions on the Pine Ridge reservation of South Dakota, not far from Mount Rushmore. Eric Schweig is outstanding as Rudy Yellow Lodge, a world-weary tribal cop who's embarrassed by the antics of his alcoholic brother, Mogie (Graham Greene, who carries the film's pain in his character.)The lighting is sometimes too dark, and the pace is plodding at times, with too many loose ends in the plot. Still, it's a unique view and a real eye-opener for those whose perception of the Lakota culture comes from ""Dances With Wolves.""",1039046400,11,608,5.01980198019802
1827864,5,B000087F0V,"I just saw this film at the Native American Museum in New York during it's premiere in this city.  It's an amazing film.  Darker and more thought provoking than Smoke Signals, it still maintains the sense of humor so characteristic of Chris Eyre's work.  The story takes place in Pine Ridge County, SD, which is, as we quickly learn from the film, the poorest county in the United States.  It is also Oglala Lakota Indian reservation.  The film is shot on location, with all the starkness of the surroundings carefully exposed.  The narrative revolves around two brothers.  Rudy (Eric Schweig) is a cop and a vigilante, who is using legal and extra-legal means to help his community.  Moggy (Graham Greene) is a triple Purple Heart Vietnam veteran and a chronic alcoholic who tries to maintain a sense of humor in face of misery and depression.  Deep love between the brothers serves as the backbone of the plot.  Things get out of hand when Rudy's vigilantism causes Moggy's suffering.  Chris Eyre employs both tragic and comic elements to give the film a fresh and unique dynamic.  And a provocative ending.",1032480000,158,1109,4.809523809523809

What they did to Mt. Rushmore is as bad as mountaintop removal in the Smoky Mountains.
I once thought of writing a short story in which small tremors occur and the noses, ears, lips fall off of George and his fellows that the money grabbers immediately sell off as souvenirs to the tourists then start an underground stone-cutting operation to continue selling the apendages of our ""greats"" as the tourists dimish and the tremors contiue leaving no trace of our hubris.",1383177600,,785,4.681159420289855

1828011,5,B000087F0V,"Chris Eyre led a production amazing in its raw, hard, close encounters with the lives of people living in a constant state of stress, poverty, and frustration. As with the older Powwow Highway and Smoke Signals (also directed by Eyre), two men with opposite personalities grate and grind against each other during the course of a story that informs the viewer of another North America, seldom seen and often forgotten. Graham Greene portrays a war veteran who blunts pain and rage at social ills with alcohol. He plays the role well enough to open a dark pit in the stomach of the viewer who roots for him to get well, but like many family members in similar situations, can only helplessly watch the downward spiral from the sidelines to its heartbreaking conclusion. Eric Schweig portrays the younger brother who stands in for the audience, watching his older brother kill himself softly, then taking vigilante justice against an economic and social system that doesn't care or doesn't mind suffering. At the core of the story is the relationship between the two brothers, how like most siblings they can easily point out each others failings, but at the same time, recognize the best in each other as no outsider can. Very dark story, but well-acted by the leads. Congratulations to Eyre for a work well-done. By the author of Windrunner.",1336780800,,1341,4.885964912280702
1828012,4,B000087F0V,"Excellent movie.  Will watch over and over.  I would have given it 5 stars if Rudy had been a little more cop-like all the time.  As always, Eric Schweig and Graham Greene gave awesome performances.",1336003200,,198,4.6
1828013,5,B000087F0V,"""Skins"" (directed by Chris Eyre) is, to me, one of the best but also saddest films I've ever seen. It's an absorbing story of two brothers on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, one of them, Rudy, a law enforcement officer (Eric Schweig) and the other, Mogie, an alcoholic (Graham Greene). Apart from the brilliance of the performances these two actors deliver, the film addresses such painful issues as alcoholism, domestic violence, social inequality and the demise of a people. We see the bleak reality of everyday life on the reservation - a nation who has been brought to near extinction by the historical events in North America, suffering from the destruction of their traditional social order, is simply trying to survive. Unlike many other films about Native Americans that I've seen, there is no heroism or hope, really, in this one, but there is humour and compassion, despite the overwhelming frustration that permeates every scene.
While the overall theme is the situation of Native Americans in today's society, the film also focuses on the universal idea of what is right and what is wrong and whether the end justifies the means - we witness the the inner battles of a human being who is doing bad things for a greater good and who has to live with the fact that with his actions he has unwittingly hurt those dearest to him.
The interaction between Rudy and Mogie reveals so much resentment, frustration, hopelessness and yearning that it often brings you to tears, and yet we see that the brothers genuinely care about each other and they are able to enjoy some rare moments of fun together. This has to be one of Graham Greene's best performances ever.
I sincerely recommend this to any viewers who are interested in more than just entertainment.",1326499200,5,1764,4.844370860927152
1828014,1,B000087F0V,"I loved the movie ""Smoke Signals"", so thinking this would be similar, bought ""Skins.""  It had filthy language all throughout and made it impossible for me to watch!

1828017,4,B000087F0V,"I just don't know what to say about this film. Graham Greene is fantastic as Mogie. Eric Schweig just nurses along my crush of many a dream. Still a fine looking fellow after all these years. Here is where my emotions get tangled - the reservation life. Anger at what's been done to natives and anger at what natives are doing to themselves and the blasted liquor stores. And then, truly angry at my own self-absorption and apathy. All right, that's what bothers me most.

This isn't a perfect movie. It skims story lines too frequently and doesn't offer enough food for thought on some of the characters' actions. Yes, Rudy is in an emotional dilemma. He's a decent and responsible person - except for the married lady that's not addressed well or concluded at all, in my opinion. He's feeling disgusted and frustrated by the very people that need him the most, if not for his example of how to live but for the inner strength and resolve that they seem to lack. Stinks to be Rudy. I'm just not sure all this would be enough for him to take up his nightly hobby.

Graham ('52) and Schweig ('67) could be brothers but when they're shown as kids, the two are only about 2 years apart. But I quibble. And now I'm also getting all in a dither again. It's fair to say this movie definitely will make you feel something. $**$!@$ phew",1304985600,,1328,4.438524590163935

1828021,4,B000087F0V,"I was shocked by the no holds barred reality of this little movie that could. It didn't hold anything back (meaning P.C.) that the Indians are only to blame themselves for their lot in life.

I just came back from a trip to Wyoming and Montana, saw the Battlefield at Little Bighorn and yes, I saw the descendents of warriors who outsmarted the Custer Cavalry, living in squalor reservations which you could always tell by the trash, dead cars, trashed houses and mobiles. Sad that brave warriors like that ended up like this: drinking away their short lives in a stupor.

I bought the book which was so well written it should have been a national best-seller. It's a book so deep on the nature of human nature that it's suitable for all races. I wish Mr. Louis would write at least ONE book like this a year!

Since the rest of you have explained the movie I'd like to make a comment on the actor who played the clerk in the hardware store where Rudy buys the red paint. He looked just so very familiar so I got out my Montana tourist guide. Damned if that actor doesn't look JUST like General Custer!!! Get the irony? Custer is selling the Lakota the means to deface a monument to the American Chiefs who were etched into sacred, stolen Indian land!! Nice touch!",1254960000,4,1264,4.439655172413793

1828026,5,B000087F0V,"I am a middle-aged white woman who works daily with the tribes in the Northern Plains, but I live nearest the Pine Ridge Reservation, home to the Oglala Lakota nation. I've written and photographed for several Native American newspapers and magazines. Originally from Detroit, via Cleveland, San Diego and Indianapolis, I find that most people in this country, particularly from east of the Mississippi, have little or no clue about what life is like for the modern-day Native American, and I increasingly suspect they don't WANT to know because their conscience might actually prod them to do something toward change.

If that resembles you, beware of watching this great film. Chris Eyre has created a remarkable movie that looks with a balanced heart at what life on most Indian reservations is like. He shows the truth: there is both deep pain and dysfunction, but there is also great love and quiet, sly humor. There is the stress of adapting to the dominant culture's expectations while trying to hold on to cultural perspectives and wisdom that are ancient.

Not everyone on the Pine Ridge, or other, reservations is an alcoholic. But enough are that pretty much everyone who isn't has a family member or friend who is. It's not a moral failing or weakness specific only to Native Americans, despite some pretty condescending comments in some of these reviews.

This story will move you and entertain you, all while letting you see a quite realistic depiction of a marvellous, yet frustrating way of life most folks in America don't get a chance to experience much of.",1249862400,14,1575,4.935849056603773

1828029,5,B000087F0V,"If you loved 'Smoke Signals', you'll love this touching story as well. Two brothers have their own separate, yet similar, struggles as they cope with the poverty and loss of hope their people has had to endure for years on the Pine Ridge Reservation (actually filmed on the Reservation). One brother sinks into a bottle of booze while brother Rudy, a police officer who becomes more and more frustrated, begins to try to solve his people's problems on his own. I loved the flashbacks of Native American photos and details of spirit and myth, as well as the touches of humor in the face of despair. A very touching tale that really opens ones eyes to the struggles of Native Americans.

1828031,2,B000087F0V,"Skins is director Chris Eyre's follow up to the 1997 Native American film Smoke Signals. Like the first film Skins is a comedy drama that has moments, and is a sound film, but could have done a bit more, and often settles into PC preachiness. One would have hoped Eyre would have matured as a filmmaker in the interim. The main character is Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig), a reservation cop on the Pine Ridge Reservation for Oglala Sioux in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He is dissatisfied with his job and life, and even more so with his older brother Mogie (Graham Greene), a stereotypical lazy and drunken Indian, who is a source of embarrassment for Rudy. He is also a Vietnam veteran, haunted by that war, and unable to take care of his teenaged son Herby (Noah Watts). After some violence directed against the tribe Rudy snaps and becomes a vigilante, first brutalizing two teenagers responsible for an attack on another boy, and then setting ablaze a local liquor store he blames for the Rez's woes. Unfortunately, Mogie happens to be sleeping off a drinking binge after breaking into the store, and is severely scarred by the fire, which guts into Rudy. While at the hospital for his fire recovery it's discovered that Mogie has a terminal liver disease. Rudy, in his guilt, decides to live out a foolish act of vandalism, once Mogie dies, as a penance.
  Overall, the film is solid, but there are times when the lighting and set up of scenes feels very amateurish. The story is rather banal, and dull, but Schweig and Greene, as the brothers, almost make up for that, and Greene is that rare actor who can both play a stereotype and subvert it. Schweig, as Rudy, is also very good, although no credible reason for his mental break is given. The scenes of the men's youth is a place where more could have been fleshed out, and a focus on the brothers, and Mogie and his son, would have been far more effective than Rudy's break. There is also a wasted romance between Rudy and Stella, played by the beautiful Michelle Thrush- an actress who can say more in a silent glance than many can in a two minute monologue. Yet, despite these positives, the film is a bit of a dud. Hopefully, in whatever his third project is, Chris Eyre can put all the wonderful little parts, moments, and performances into a tour de force.",1221696000,5,2328,4.5669856459330145
1828032,5,B000087F0V,"Prior to Columbus, there were 100M Native Americans.  Today, there are less than 3M, but their cultures are still alive and thriving.

""Skins"" is the first movie filmed on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Pine Ridge is in the shadow of Mount Rushmore and Wounded Knee is part of the preserve.  There are no 'set pieces' on this reservation.  Yes, it looks like a Third World Country, because that is precisely what it is.  Listen to the statistics at the front of this movie.

The story is old as time.  Two brothers, Mogie (Greene), the fallen warrior didn't come back quite right from Vietnam.  Wounded three times, he spends his time drinking away the memories, but he's still kept his love of family and sense of humor. The younger brother Rudy (Schweig) is a reservation cop and a vigilante. When Rudy tries to help the res by burning a white-owned liquor store on US lands, he ends up accidentally injuring his brother.

The story's told with stark detail and empathy by Chris Eyre (Smoke Signals) who is also a Native American--as are most of the cast and crew.  The writer, Adrian C. Lewis, is also a Native American who believed the story needed to be told.

Don't stop watching at the end of the film.  Aftward, the cast and crew get together to talk about their roles in the film and their Native American beliefs.  One of the things they mentioned is how difficult the filming was, but the cast and crew burned sage and meditated every day.  I think the love and effort every person put into this film clearly shows.

1828035,5,B000087F0V,"This movie is certain to be one of the most enduring examples of Native American cinema throughout history.  The acting is great, and the story is magnificent.  While it may be hard for a non-native to fully understand and appreciate the subject matter and story itself, repeated viewings are a must, and will open up a new level of conciousness to those open to it.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, but prehaps especially to people who are just getting into native culture and want to understand it.
  As for the actors, Graham Greene is fantastic, and this is the movie that got me started on Eric Schweig.  The supporting cast is phenomenal too, with Zahn McClarnon, Gil Birmingham, Nathaniel Arcand, and more!

PS Remember this movie is not for kids, I've seen too many negative reviews from people that somehow think this is a family movie.  It's rated R for a reason, and I admit that its stark reality may be almost hurtful at first.",1211932800,,955,4.642857142857143

Not really the 'dark' tale that the reviewers/critics were calling it--maybe it would seem more depressing to people who were previously unaware of life on the Pine Ridge rez and thus were shocked or something? Not sure. But I thought there was so much humor in it--plenty of laughs. And the story is meaningful, the script is tight, direction spot-on. This is a great example of a Native-written Native-made film.",1193097600,,505,4.952941176470588
1828040,2,B000087F0V,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with all these high ratings. I was extremely disappointed with this movie and I am still even a bit depressed by it.

The acting is good, the setting is marvelous and the story is real  -- but only real if you're fine with protagonists who represent the lowest common denominator in human moral experience.

Rudy Yellow Lodge, the main character, looks like a pretty good guy on the surface. He's a cop. He's intelligent, clean cut, articulate and serious about his work. However, his way of handling his rage is that he goes around at night in blackface and a stocking cap engaged in helpful public services -- breaking some teenager's kneecaps with a baseball bat, torching a liquor store and vandalizing Mt. Rushmore with oil paint. That's the sort of thing he likes to do when he's not busy enabling his alcoholic brother and sleeping with his married girlfriend. What's up with that? I read somewhere that the Sioux are traditionally very family-oriented people, but if this movie was my only source of information, I'd have a very different impression.

Not only is Rudy the worst kind of violent criminal -- a cop with no respect for the law -- he's also almost completely remorseless. The kids he sends to the hospital for broken knees confess their actual crime (yes, they murdered someone). All he cares about when he interviews them is: Do they know who messed them up? In other words, do they have ID on him and is he going to jail yet? A brave Lakota warrior in the making.

Then, rather than acknowledge to himself that he is creating a lot of pain in people's lives, he attributes many of the tragic consequences of his acts to the contributions of Iktomi, the trickster spirit in Lakota spiritual beliefs. That is because he keeps seeing little spiders. Rudy goes to a sweat lodge to see if he can clear Iktomi out of his life, but do you think that he ever considers, for one minute, changing the hostile and illegal course of his life? Nah.

In case you're in doubt about the real theme of this movie, listen closely. It's repeated two or three times and it goes something like this: whatever happens in this life, we have no control. We're completely at the mercy of unseen forces. Right.

The clincher is that his brother Mogie, who rarely takes anything seriously, has written Rudy a very long letter on his deathbed, asking him to take good care of his son, because Rudy is the only GOOD role model the kid has. Oh his way back to the Rez, after dumping oil paint on Rushmore, what do you think Rudy sees? It's his 18 year old, handsome nephew trying to thumb a ride out of town! Do you think he turns around, to at least give this kid a lift so he doesn't end up facedown in a ditch somewhere? Heck no! He laughs and drives away!

Wow!

Even though I totally understand the defacing of Mt. Rushmore, and I  understand the appalling poverty depicted in all its truth in this film, I think the Oglala Sioux were very unfavorably portrayed by Chris Eyre. If I were Native American, I'd be asking Eyre to chose another profession quickly -- or at least another subject! And all this time I thought the Cheyenne and the Sioux got along together very well .... What a rotten movie, and what a disgusting portrayal of sadly overlooked and under-represented minority in this country!

For once, how about a movie that depicts GOOD pepole who are also Native? That is what they always used to say about the westerns with whooping hostiles scalping everybody. I never thought I'd have to make that complaint about an N.A. producer filming on a real reservation in the 21st century. If Eyre wants to straighten his karma out, how about a movie about the life of Donehogawa?",1188345600,8,3715,4.563063063063063
1828041,5,B000087F0V,"If you want to get an idea how American Indians portray themselves today, watch Chris Eyre's films. They are not documentaries, yet I am left with the feeling that despite poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, unemployment, and other problems, reservations are tight-knit communities which are normally closed to whites. Chris Eyre lifts the curtain a bit, lets us catch a glimpse of what holds them together, and he does this with a wonderful sense of humor, tenderness, and poetry.

ETA: I just finished reading the book and must say Eric Schweig and Graham Greene did outstanding jobs portraying Rudy and Mogie. Fortunately, the movie is a ""sanitized"" version of the book (whose pubertal language I found annoying at times), and especially Rudy is much more mature than his literary model.",1186790400,3,787,5.10077519379845

1828043,5,B000087F0V,"Chris Eyre's deeply affecting ""Skins,"" adapted from a novel by Adrian C. Louis, is a small but potent film about the complex ties that bind families, and an unblinking look at the dire conditions of reservation life. Among a solid cast, actor Graham Greene gives a towering performance as Mogie, a hard-luck case in the advanced stages of alcoholism. Even though his character is perpetually cranky, unkempt and irresponsible, Greene still manages to win our sympathy and compassion--no small feat.",1185321600,4,498,5.2375
1828044,5,B000087F0V,"I must have seen this film (at least) four years ago.  I loved it then, and, upon recalling the plot, still appreciate the power and intensity it presented to us, through its depiction of the turbulence and pain of the Plains Indian experience on the ""rez"" (reservation).  Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig), a man employed to uphold honor and accountablity, snaps in the face of his brother, Mogie (Graham Greene)'s alcoholism and the desolate existence of his fellow residents.  In defiance, Rudy decides to take part in random acts of violence (beating a white supremacist, destroying a liquor store in a fiery act of arson, fueled by anger).  Though, Rudy's original intention is to take a bold (but violent) stand against the multitudes of injustice laid on the heads and hearts of his Native brothers on sisters, his plan backfires on him.

Director Chris Eyre (SMOKE SIGNALS) boldly directs this film and takes us all on a gothic, violent and very disturbing journey down the path of anger, oppression and (attempted) redemption.  I really got a sense of the rage blazing behind the camera (in the director's chair) as I did in the eyes of the actors who so masterfully portrayed such powerful and disturbed characters.  SKINS challenges the stereotype (and stigma) of alcoholism in the Native American community, as well as everyday racism that occurs as easily as breathing in and out.  Eyre's unflinching account of these experiences is beautiful and heartbreaking.  Watch SKINS purely for the reason that not enough people have heard of the film (but ought to).  What's more, you will walk away with a perspective that you may not have possessed upon initially pressing the ""play"" button on your DVD player.",1180569600,6,1716,4.968531468531468
1828045,5,B000087F0V,Chris Eyre does a wonderful job of bringing to light the truth of what happens on the reservation. This movie is serious yet has some comic relief.

1828050,5,B000087F0V,"Skins is a compelling movie about the troubles that face reservations in the Dakotas, this movie centering around two brothers that grew up around an angry an abusive father who later grow up taking diffrent paths.  Graham Greene is the eldest brother who spiralled into alcoholism his marriage has fractured and though he cares for his teenage son his addiction has fractured their relationship.  Eric Schweig is a deditcated Reservation cop who is longsuffering but fed up with his brother's self destructive behavior.  Eric has some time to have a relationship with one of the ladies involved in the community but his anger at forces that tear into his people push him toward being a masked vigilante, feeling that as a policeman that his ability to make a difference is hamstrung by regulations and ever increasing threats to the well being of those he protects.  Eric is no supercop, there is a humorous scene where he trips and knocks himself out on a rock which shows he's vulnerable and human, as well as his greif over his brother.  In my opinion Eric Schweig who has played everything from a hero in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS to a murderous witch in THE MISSING gives an show of force as an actor in SKINS portraying a beliveable troubled brother and lawman who wishes to stop the destructive influnences that plague his community.",1146355200,7,1340,4.783549783549783
1828051,5,B000087F0V,"Graham Greene is an amazing actor, and it was very difficult to remember that he was an actor playing a part, and not the character himself.

This film is set on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in southern South Dakota near Mt. Rushmore.  The Wounded Knee Massacre took place nearby and this reservation is more or less emblematic of the suffering of the American Indians (or Native Americans, if that is what you prefer).  The poverty -- discussed in documentary clips and shown in the film's story line -- is mind-boggling.  I found myself wondering how could this be and why isn't someone marching on Washington about this?  Unable to find jobs in this desolate part of the plains, many turn to alcohol, and the alcohol leads to violence and illness.

And that is the subject of the film.  There are two main characters -- brothers.  One has become a policeman and more or less has his life together, although he is unmarried and has no children, and he may not be as together as he outwardly seems. The other brother (Graham Greene) is a full-blown non-functioning alcoholic -- a pathetic man in many ways, but also oddly gentle and loved by his family.

Both brothers are reacting, each in his own way, to life on the reservation -- not a terrible place in terms of community, but a place with tremendous social problems rooted in poverty, alcoholism, and cultural issues.  Anger is a significant theme throughout the film, but it's a simmering anger, exemplified by caustic comments about Mt. Rushmore -- four white American presidents carved out of the sacred rock of the Black Hills.

The acting is amazing and the film is riveting.  Despite the serious subject matter, I wouldn't describe the film as really depressing, in part because of the good humor and the warmth that manages to survive the conditions.

1828054,5,B000087F0V,"Native American director Chris Eyre has created another excellent film about life on the reservation, told from the Indian point of view. Other reviews here represent the content of the film well, its story line involving two brothers and its social commentary, exposing the impact of poverty and alcoholism on the Lakota Sioux descendants of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.

The movie, however, provides only a partial view of the book it's based on by Indian writer, Adrian Louis. His novel, ""Skins,"" has enough material for a 10-part miniseries. It immerses the reader in the deeper complexities of its subject matter, exploring the dimensions of its characters more thoroughly (and with darker humor) and conveying a great deal more about life on the reservation, with its compelling mix of Indian and white cultures and the resulting ambiguities, competing world views, and conflicted values. It is significant that Iktomi, the trickster spirit and shape-shifter, is a central theme in both novel and film, for appearance and reality, wisdom and stupidity, pride and shame, love and rage are all in a continuing dance for dominance.

Rudy, the Indian cop, portrays these confusing conflicts beautifully, representing both the law in his tribal police uniform and vigilante justice in his blackface and pantyhose mask. The author's book explores other dimensions of Rudy's confusion by letting us learn more about his relationships with women. In the novel he is married and estranged from his wife, and we follow the rocky ups and downs of his growing attraction to his cousin's wife, Stella, while he carries on with other men's wives as well. Afflicted with hypertension, he takes meds that affect his sexual performance, and much of the novel traces the rising and falling cycles of his libido, all of which are unpredictable and seemingly under the spell of Iktomi. Finally, while the film makes clear the love that bonds Rudy to his brother Mogie, the depth of that love comes across more strongly in the novel, as well as the demons that haunt Mogie and produce brotherly conflict.

See the movie first, so you can more easily visualize the world that Adrian Louis describes and enjoy the wonderful performances of Eric Schweig and Graham Greene. Then read the book and allow yourself to know this subject and comprehend the Lakota culture more deeply. The ending, involving Mt. Rushmore, which is given an abruptly abbreviated treatment in the movie, will also make a lot more sense.",1099612800,67,2493,5.075609756097561
