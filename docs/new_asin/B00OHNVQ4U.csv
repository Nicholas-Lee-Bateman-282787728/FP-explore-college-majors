8683660,5,B00OHNVQ4U,"I bought the 1st DVD series over a year ago- Learn Fencing (A Beginner's Guide Sword Fighting) which covers Foil, pe, & Sabre. A great technical reference guide to fencing. I studied it intensely and found it to be very useful as a beginners. So when I saw the Learn Fencing Advance DVD set came out, I was so excited. This couldn't have come soon enough. I had been fencing for over a year now and have most of my fencing basics down. I haven't been exposed many different fencing schools or any fencing camps, this advanced dvd is a great tool for me to learn different methods of training. I'd learned and see things in fencing in a different perspective.
  Learn Fencing (Advance pe) is one of the best fencing dvd I have ever seen or owned. I had bought other euro pe dvds that show great athlete doing advance movement. But never explain any techniques in great detail. This pe dvd covers proper stretching, strength and conditioning exercises. And also covers partner fencing drills, advanced techniques (combination attack), tactics (second intention) and fight analysis. As a beginner, I feel that this Advance pe dvd along with my instructor can take me to the next level. That is competition!",1418256000,5,1203,4.723809523809524
