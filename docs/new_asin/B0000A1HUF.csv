1900625,4,B0000A1HUF,"Rolie Polie Olie is great! My son is 2 and asks for this video all the time.  Now, anything he sees that is a little scary or has to do with Halloween he calls ""Spookie Ookie.""  He rarely has the attention span to watch Book of Pooh and Out of the Box.  Honestly, I do too, as the shows are kinda dry.  But Rolie Polie Olie more than makes up for it.  The DVD includes The Legend of Spookie Ookie, Funhouse, and Queen of the Pumpkins.  I miss Playhouse Disney shows like this.",1254960000,,476,4.064516129032258
1900626,4,B0000A1HUF,"My little girl likes the shows, got a little bored during the Winnie the Pooh one, but enjoyed everything thing else!",1223683200,,117,4.619047619047619
1900627,5,B0000A1HUF,"All you need to do to bypass the long menu introduction is press the ""menu"" button two times, and you're good to go!  Wonderful animation...try watching it in the dark.  The jack-0-lanterns pop right out of the screen!  Highly recommended Halloween viewing for the whole family!",1221955200,,278,5.0
1900628,5,B0000A1HUF,"I highly recommend all the episodes from the Rolie Polie world created by children's author William Joyce along with Walt Disney, has been a wonderful feature for children. The clinky clanky robot world is fun, with good morals, and non-violent stories. This tape has 3 different Olie stories and in the first ""The Legend of Spookie Ookie."" Pappy tricks Zowie and Olie by appearing as the orange Spookie Ookie"", a halloween character. But does the real Spookie Ookie arrive? In the 2nd episode ""Oooh Scary,"" Olie and his pal Billy create a fun house to scare the younger kids, but they are the ones that get spooked. The third story is ""Zowie Queen of the Pumpkins"", whre Zowie meets spok-o-lanterns in the pumpkin patch at midnight.
Next we have  Halloween episodes from ""The Book of Pooh"", and one from the show, ""Out of the Box"". Also an instructional feature from Disney on carving a jack-O-lantern, and another on making Halloween decorations from everyday items.",1194566400,,968,4.902439024390244
1900629,5,B0000A1HUF,"My kids saw these shows when they were first aired on Disney and I videotaped them back then.  Now that we don't even own a VCR anymore, I was excited to see them on DVD.

Kids are 7 and 5 and they still love to watch these shows.  They don't ever remember seeing them since it was a few years back when they had it on video, but they love this DVD!",1193443200,,349,3.8194444444444446

1900631,1,B0000A1HUF,This is the second year that we have pulled out this seasonal DVD and my son enjoys them now just as much as he did last year.  The reason I started warehousing seasonal DVDs was because of the level of frustration I have with this menu. First of all there is a verbose and utterly unnecessary narration about how to use the menu. Once you get past it or hit MENU on your remote to shut the guy up then the play all function from the main menu doesn't even work.  You can then go into a sub menu for each show.  Just in case you didn't catch in the first time there is yet another explanation of how to use the menu.  When I press MENU at this point I am removed from the all menus and have to start over.  I can take it for a few weeks a year but it's going back into storage as soon as the jack-o-lanterns hit the trash can.  I have to give this DVD a one just based on the poor menu design.,1130630400,,893,3.879120879120879
1900632,5,B0000A1HUF,"We, too, never had any trouble bypassing the menu. This is another great creation by Disney. For any kids and parents who adore Playhouse Disney, this is the DVD for you, just sweet Halloween cheer. We would rate it a 10 if we could. It is one of our favorites!!!",1128988800,2,263,4.28
1900633,1,B0000A1HUF,"This DVD is not worth the money (might buy it for $5.00). The beginning is this long drawn out explanation of how to use the main menu and about the spooky ghost who will try to scare you as you make your selections (I'm not kidding you, it takes 3 to 5 minutes to get to the right screen to start the program you want to watch then another 2-3 minutes to start it from there). My daughter was screaming for Rolie Polie Olie and I couldn't skip the main menu to start it and then it was only 20 minutes long (there's Pooh bear on it too). Don't buy it!!",1066780800,4,553,3.990990990990991

1900640,5,B0000A1HUF,"Every year the little boy I babysat and I watch our VHS of this, but now we needed it on DVD...he is in second grade now, and very ""cool"", no longer needing a babysitter...but he still came over to watch this with me!  That alone made it wonderful!
Seriously, tho, this is a really clever and cute series, and this is one of the best of the holiday dvds",1388275200,,353,4.115942028985507

1900646,3,B0000A1HUF,"Rolie Polie Spookie Ookie scared my 29 month old son! I'm not surprised. The jack o' lantern faces are scary and 'Spookie Ookie' himself gets angry when he can't get in his house and turns on Zowie! It may be fine for some people, but I wouldn't want any toddler to see this!",1350000000,,275,4.2075471698113205

1900649,5,B0000A1HUF,This dvd is a fun movie to watch. My grandkids had asked for this movie because they saw it on tv a few years ago. Since we couldn't find it in any store I was very happy to find it here. My granddaughter who's 14 was so excited to see it again. This Halloween movie was one of her favorites.,1291507200,,292,3.8833333333333333

1900651,3,B0000A1HUF,"I believe that other 2 reviewers who had problems with the opening menu were slightly exaggerating but still had valid points. Although it didn't take 2 to 3 minutes for the opening narration to end, it lasts much longer than necessary (approximately 60 seconds).",1262908800,,263,5.0

7995277,4,B0000A1HUF,The only thing I don't like about this dvd is it takes a long time to start and you have to go through all the options to play. Otherwise cute movie,1520294400,,148,3.806451612903226
