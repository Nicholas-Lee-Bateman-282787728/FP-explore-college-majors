8214028,3,B000UO4HLE,"Not a game that will fix a relationship (not that mine needs fixing) but I purchased this thinking it would be a game we could enjoy over and over but really it's almost a one and done thing... Would suggest it for a special occassion... ie birthday, ann. val. etc.",1268092800,,265,4.32
8214029,4,B000UO4HLE,Only played it once so far. It's fun and interesting and makes you focus on specific tasks that you otherwise may mindlessly do. Did repeat questions in just the first game.,1265846400,5,173,4.612903225806452
8214030,5,B000UO4HLE,My spouse and I have tried a lot of games for couples.  This was the most fun.  Fun Q&A mixed with romantic challenges.  Not embarrasing or kinky.  Just fun.,1265155200,3,157,4.310344827586207

8214032,1,B000UO4HLE,"i bought this for a little variety in bed, however the most i got from it is boredom and laughs from both of us who are now in here not even believing that people wrote the previous reviews saying how excited and satisfied they got with this dvd.
we didn't give up playing hoping it would eventualy get better but it never did. it just got us bored and sleepy. i had to check the reviews again right away to make sure i ordered the right dvd. unfortunately this is very disapointing but im glad we don't need games to have a good sexual time.
do not buy it, ill give it to u cuz its worthless. US$30,00 in the garbage",1257206400,3,617,4.107438016528926
8214033,4,B000UO4HLE,"Wife and I have played any and all versions of either the online games or DVD games for couples.  We like this one a lot.  My only thought is I wished it had more versatility.  It definitely is worth the purchase and yes, we still enjoy playing it.  However, when compared to the European version of this game (DVD), it is not quite there yet.  Hopefully, in future editions, the level of choice and options will increase.  All around, a great game for couples!!!",1231027200,6,463,4.4523809523809526
8214034,5,B000UO4HLE,"This couples game saved my relationship by bringing the romance back to action. I don't know what rene is talking about, we had a lot of erotic challenges and everytime just kept getting better. A must buy for you couples out there looking to explore!!!!!",1230422400,3,255,4.688888888888889
8214035,5,B000UO4HLE,"This DVD is so much fun and it keeps things interesting between lovers! My husband and I have played this so many times already and it just gets better with every play. It keeps things interesting, we get so anxious to remove one anothers close....I love it! thanks!",1202688000,13,266,4.5625
