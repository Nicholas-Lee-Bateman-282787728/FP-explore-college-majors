6389021,4,B00JQHOJZU,"I saw the First season and loved it. This one is a bit diffrent The characters still have the same voice or sound.
But you don't see them more offen then in the first season.
A lot happens and even enemies could chance...",1405296000,,221,4.162790697674419
6389022,5,B00JQHOJZU,"Great show! Clever, intelligent stories. Very exciting and animated so much better than most cartoons on television today.",1404691200,,122,5.833333333333333
6389023,5,B00JQHOJZU,"I saw this when they first aired in the 1980's and didn't think it was as good as the original 1960's series.
Now seeing these again, I don't know why I was so hard on the new series, maybe because I was disappointed it was not the original.

The truth is that I now find it as enjoyable as the original 1960's series! This 1980's series seems like a 'season 2' to the original series.  The stories and animation style mimic the original seires (although Dr. Quest and Race always look angry now).

The picture quality is crisp, clean and the colors are bright.  It looks like a new transfer and not the original 1980's video transfer.  A few episodes have a flicker in some scenes, Animation cels were used and this could be a defect in the cels.

THIS IS A DVD-R and it took my Blu-ray player forever to load it up.  Warner Archive puts a disclaimer ont he back stating ""This disc is expected to play back on DVD play only devices. And may not play back on other DVD devices including Recorders and PC drives.""
Well, I can verify that it did load up and play perfectly on my DVD Recorder as well as my Apple Laptop DVD player.
Another reviewer couldn't play it, must have been using a Microsoft PC.  I never owned one of those things.

***7/20/14 UPDATE***
After episode #7 ""The Monolith Man"" which introduces a living stone man the series drops a notch as this creature, named ""Hardrok"", joins the quest team on their further adventures.  An unbelievable character that doesn't belong with the team.  What is worse is that few people seem to notice this creature is a living rock!

At 13 episodes, this means that over half of the series is still good.

Disc #1 (All classic type adventures until ""Monolith""
1) Peril of the Reptilian (feels just like the classic series)
2) Nightmares of Steel
3) Aliens Among Us
4) Deadly Junket (Jessie, an adventurous red-haired girl, is introduced but doesn't stay. She would join the Quest Team in the 1990's version of the series.)
5) Forty Fathoms Into Yesterday (a strange time travel story)
6) Vikong Lives
7) The Monolith Man (Introducing ""Hardrok"")
8) Secret of the Clay Warriors (""Hardrok"" is now a Quest Team member. Why do they have trouble believing in Clay Warriors when they have ""Hardrok"" on their team???))
9) Warlord of the Sky (Possibly written before ""Hardrok"" was introduced as he goes off to explore an underground cave while the action takes place above.  A decent story.)

Disc #2 (""Hardrok"" appears in all of these)
10) The Scourge of Skyborg
11) Temple of Gloom
12) Creeping Unknown
13) Skulduggery",1404604800,25,2562,4.6
6389024,3,B00JQHOJZU,"MOD = manufacture on demand aka DVD-R

Typically difficult to rip or play these discs on a computer. You might have to try an assortment of drives to get one that can read them. Not sure why these discs are so difficult to read.

The quality is bitrate-starved typical of these types of discs coming out of warner archive as MOD. Visual quality suffers greatly, but it's 'watchable'.

Haven't watched it yet, I'm simply commenting on the quality of the product itself. I wish they would give us a proper release like the 26 episode Jonny Quest (1964) set or the volume 1 of The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest Season 1 (volume 2 was one of these MOD disc releases). Like, you know, pressed discs?",1403222400,10,695,4.5

6389031,5,B00JQHOJZU,I was missing this set from my collection. Once I realized it I had to buy it right away!! I love Jonny Quest and actually got a letter from network from Hadji ( or someone pretending to be) when I was a child. Given I was adopted from India I guess I related to the character when I was little watching it. Still a favorite of mine and my 5 year old watches them with me sometimes.,1490918400,4,382,3.9740259740259742

6389045,4,B00JQHOJZU,"While this is almost universally accepted as the worst season of Jonny Quest, I still liked it for the most part.  I definitely didn't have the feel of the first season naturally.  And some of it was bordering on the ridiculous.  But still it was fun to watch.",1464825600,,260,4.375

6389048,1,B00JQHOJZU,Misleading to call this complete series when there are only 13 episodes on two disc.  Season one has four disc and 26 episodes. How can the complete series have less episodes then the entire series? I am returning to sender. Don't be fooled like I was.,1449360000,4,252,4.478260869565218
6389049,4,B00JQHOJZU,Not quite what the original series was but pretty good anyway.  Lots of adventure and fun too.,1449014400,2,94,4.529411764705882
6389050,5,B00JQHOJZU,No problems with this purchase.  Happy with the results.,1447891200,,56,5.222222222222222
6389051,3,B00JQHOJZU,"I grew up as a kid loving Johnny Quest. However, this shows like most of the other action adventure cartoons of Hanna-Barbera of the 80s that the influence of kid friendly adventures. There is more jokes and less action in these compared to the 1960s cartoons. In that I mean there is less sort of rock'em and sock'em action and more like last minute sort of plan failures of the villains or someone will come on and push the self destruct button at the wrong time. It still has the same feel as the originals, but still missing that adventure spark that made the originals so fun. Still great to watch with my kids and enjoy.",1442361600,15,626,4.405172413793103

This set is great, good quality recordings.",1436140800,,147,4.285714285714286
6389055,4,B00JQHOJZU,"Now that I've seen all of the episodes I'd have to say that it does recapture quite well the original series. As good? Well, I do think that the animation in the sixties show is a little better and I wish they had not included that Hardrok character in the latter part of it. Also I wish that they had brought in Jade for at least one episode since she made a valuable contribution in two episodes of the first series. Still, it was worth buying and I do look upon it as part of my Jonny Quest collection.  I want nothing to do with The Real Adventures which came out in the nineties because this is for a different generation who probably wouldn't appreciate the older shows.  The Eighties Adventures is pretty good in my book.",1435017600,14,728,4.306569343065694

6389064,4,B00JQHOJZU,These are lesser known episodes of Jonny Quest and not on the same quality of storytelling or animation. But they still offer more entertaining animated storytelling than what anyone can come up with these days. The rock guy thing really needed to be left out.,1419897600,7,260,4.8

6389068,3,B00JQHOJZU,I really give this 2 1/2 stars.  The stories are not as good as the 60's version.  They don't flow as well and are not as interesting.  After the rock creature joins the team it tumbles even more.  He is supposed to have a rock like body which would keep him from the every day bumps and bruises normal people get but them we see him get injured as if he was a normal person.  There are some decent episodes here but overall it doesn't compare to the original show.,1417564800,5,465,4.122222222222222
