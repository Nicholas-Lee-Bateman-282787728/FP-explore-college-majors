639715,3,6303421725,Curse of the Starving Class is a great play and then movie by Sam Shepard.  It depicts the underside of american life.  The dreams of the charecters are unattainable as far as they are concerned and we watch on as they  discover this.,953596800,7,234,4.395348837209302

639863,4,6303421725,"The movie shows the importance of family unity. The family starts off united by a string and eventually everyone starts to pursue their own path. When the drunk father finally realizes his mistakes, it's too late.",1450828800,,213,4.944444444444445
639864,3,6303421725,whoops!!!! wrong movie....My first review I mistook for a different movie.....,1448236800,,78,6.181818181818182
639914,2,6303421725,Curse of the Starving Class wasn't that interesting to me.,1427328000,,58,4.9
639915,1,6303421725,I would not call this a normal farm family.  They remind me of a bunch of squatters using up what is left of the place.  Everything needs repairs and a 10-year-old could tend to.  I hope people who live in cities do not think this is the way farm families really live.  We all pitch in and get the work done!!!  This place in this movie is a disgrace and so are the characters.,1425859200,,377,4.04054054054054
639916,5,6303421725,"Very much like a play on the screen. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. All of the actors were excellent, I am shocked the actress that plays the daughter, Kristen Fioella, didn't become a huge star. At first James Woods' character is off-putting but hang in there, he slowly begins to steal the show. James was still super handsome so not hard on the eyes. I adore Henry Thomas, he's so handsome and talented. Have you seen him in (they've changed the title since I've seen it) Briar Patch 2003 with Dominique Swain? Great movie. Back to Starving... I love finding films I've never heard of and try them and they turn out to be great. I cried at the end. Loved it.",1421452800,,665,4.328

639918,1,6303421725,never received this movie,1415577600,,25,5.5
639919,3,6303421725,I am a big James Woods fan but this is not one of his best efforts.  Movie was depressing and I killed it before the end.,1402704000,,121,3.6538461538461537
639920,2,6303421725,This could have been a great movie but there was too much meaningless goofiness. I wondered if I was watching a goofy comedy or a family drama.,1401235200,2,143,4.333333333333333
639921,1,6303421725,did not like this movie at all. i watch 1/2 or a 1/4 of it and shut it off. Very dumb movie. uck,1363737600,2,96,3.217391304347826
639922,2,6303421725,I normally like James Woods but the story didn't do his acting justice. I have seen him in much better films.,1363219200,2,109,4.238095238095238
639923,4,6303421725,"James Woods stands beneath a violent thunderstorm, naked and screaming towards the heavens at the top of his lungs like some atomic leftover of those fringe lunatic people you dare not make eye-contact with. There he is, in one of the most mesmerizing scenes in film, encapsulating the views of a playwright/actor by the name of Sam Shepard. It is in this scene, towards the end of the film, that we know where Shepard intended for us to go, and that is the dark corridors of a seemingly normal farm family as the last piecemeal foundations of their family erode away into nothingness.

This film is not for everyone; in fact, I would venture to say it's not for most, but for those willing to take it on, I do believe they will be engrossed in its story, and that's what movies should do - tell us a story we can lose ourselves in.",1212019200,10,832,4.402597402597403
7845860,1,6303421725,"Wow, what a misfire. I saw a production of the play some years ago and was curious how it would translate to the screen. This adaptation is a total mess, so tedious and uninvolving that it was a serious chore to sit through. The writer has changed the play in ways that rob the story of its power, and the director tries to turn James Woods into a kind of drunk slapstick character. Kathy Bates actually gives a good performance, but that is not enough to make the film worth watching.",1486252800,,485,4.34065934065934
7845861,5,6303421725,"I loved it,  had me engrossed from the first moment on.  Unfortunately this is probably more real for some than they'd like to admit.  Well done, well done.",1485561600,,156,4.5
7845862,4,6303421725,fine film.,1485561600,,10,4.5
7845863,5,6303421725,This movie was amazing in its portrayal of a bizarre rural family. I have to watch it again to see all the bits and pieces that hold it together. Loved it.,1484697600,,155,4.032258064516129
7845864,1,6303421725,Completely awful.,1484611200,,17,8.0
7845865,1,6303421725,"I was very disappointed in this movie! I am a big fan of Cathy Bates and also really like James Woods, however, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! What a waste of my time and their talent. The plot was horrible, the language from this kids in the movie was horrible, I have no idea what the writer and producer were thinking when they put this plan into action but apparently they really didn't think it through. It's a shame you can't give less than a one star rating.",1484352000,,496,4.123711340206185
7845866,1,6303421725,Just awful. Stopped watching after one hour. Pure torture!!,1483920000,,59,5.666666666666667

7845869,3,6303421725,"A dysfunctional family with a weak moral compass.
Dad has PTSD and is a drunk and makes all his decisions while he is drunk.
Quaid is like the traveling salesman promising the white horse and silver saddle.
The daughter is barely hanging in there and puts on a 10 second show that I've never seen before.
These people are not starving (for food), they have a complete disregard for food.
California City has un-cordoned mine shafts that go straight down to the abyss in the desert. (I still get night sweats)
He could of hung in there if he had brought his case of beer home and played his $20 Western Auto acoustic guitar until he passed out.
.Just don't bring up the war.",1482969600,,673,4.435483870967742
