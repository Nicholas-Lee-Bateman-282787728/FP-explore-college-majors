3086520,4,B0012DUCIY,I love to travel and this movie helped to give me ideas as to where I'd like to visit. I recommend it.,1369612800,,102,3.6818181818181817
3086521,1,B0012DUCIY,"So I will be visiting acadia in a few months and hoped this would give me more insight as to what to expect. From this video I've learned what to expect: seagulls! And maybe a chipmunck and a salamander. Except for the one chipmunck and salamander that is all they kept showing, seagull sitting on a rock, seagull flying. They even referred to it as ""the majestic seagull"". Sorry narrarator but I deal with ""majestic seagulls"" all the time trying to steal my food at the jersey shore. I am really hoping to see more in acadia than seagulls.",1366243200,3,540,4.4646464646464645
3086522,4,B0012DUCIY,"An excellent overview of Acadia National Park following the park throughway from the visitor center to the top of Cadillac Mountain and points of interest along the route. Great nature photography with very good narration.
Very interesting to view regardless of whether you have visited the park or not.",1365897600,,303,5.204081632653061
3086523,1,B0012DUCIY,"This video was of relatively poor quality and got boring quickly. It would not hold the attention of our family, especially the teen and tween.",1362787200,2,143,4.76
3086524,2,B0012DUCIY,"Disappointing.... Unless all you want to see is pretty fall leaf colors. Lots and lots of pretty fall leaf colors that could have been photographed at any of dozens of other places in the northeast in September ...

When I decided to purchase this DVD, I had expected to feel that I had visited Acadia National Park and after viewing , I certainly did not. There were a couple of minutes of waves washing up on a couple of beaches, a view from Cadillac Mt and some time driving along the loop road. I was equally unimpressed with the extensive views of wildlife. 1 chipmunk, 1 yellow dog, 3 seagulls, 1 duck

Two stars for the pretty leaves - None for conveying information about the park.",1206921600,,689,4.4603174603174605

8245250,2,B0012DUCIY,"What a lack of creativity.
The production is so frustrating; they go to an extraordinary place and have managed to produce one of the weakest documentaries I've ever seen, with lazy from-the-roadside camera work and repeated loops of a seagull on a rock. I'm wondering if the camera guy was having too much of a holiday to bother making any effort. They then over dub the whole thing with this awful synth music - even referring to the sound of the waves at Thunder Cave whilst playing some dreadful syrupy chords over it. Let us hear the waves!",1495584000,,545,4.571428571428571
8245251,2,B0012DUCIY,Very dated and too focused on one season,1455840000,,40,4.125
8245252,1,B0012DUCIY,This video is OLD....and really BORING!  The photography was pathetic....I could have done a better job with my phone!  It seemed to have been made for international visitors....but I can't believe it would inspire anyone to visit.  It was truly a disappointment.,1441843200,,263,5.214285714285714
8245253,3,B0012DUCIY,Cinematography not very exciting; few hints for park visitors and more just a video tour of the 27-mile ring road through the park. Moving shots are long and somewhat repetitive. I visited Acadia a week after watching this video and the park is much more exciting than the video made it look.,1436400000,,292,4.634615384615385

8245257,2,B0012DUCIY,"I think that the Acadia Park is breathtaking but this video was poorly written, edited and produced.  The sound and narration reminded me of the motion pictures I used to watch in grade school, over 50 years ago.  Obviously, the people who created this video need to re-visit film school - and they need a new writer.  Don't waste your time on this video. Order a book on Acadia Park and you will get much more relevant information.",1393718400,,432,4.512820512820513
8245258,1,B0012DUCIY,"I was hoping to get a little more insight on Acadia, but the video was so boring my wife ended up falling asleep and I almost did as well. Seagulls, tree tops, close-ups of vegetation, vehicles from the late 80's and outfits on the people shown really date this video, and don't even get me started on the horrible soundtrack. I had hopes that it would get better if I just give it time. It didn't. Do not waste your time.",1389312000,,422,4.222222222222222
8245259,3,B0012DUCIY,Needs an update on the soundtrack and cinematography wise as well. The subject matter however was outstanding. Sounds and looks a bit dated.,1379116800,,140,5.130434782608695
