8204666,5,B000S86J40,"I absolutely love this belly dancer! She is very good at what she does- explains her moves well, and combines hula with belly dance well into a fun dance! Great picture quality- a must for variety and technique in every belly dance collection!",1375574400,,243,4.674418604651163
8204667,4,B000S86J40,"Sonia is a fantastic dancer--I've had the pleasure of watching her perform with the Belly Dance Superstars and is a good teacher also.  I liked how this DVD had a technique section and then combinations, although I think repeating the combinations more than once would've been helpful.  The live drums were a nice touch--I can't help but dance to those drum beats!  It was cute to see how closely the musicians watched Sonia's moves--she is lovely.  There is only a half an hour of actual exercise though--waaay to short!  I did enjoy the documentary footage of Tahiti though--I'd love to visit!  But I felt myself wishing that Tamato or Moena--the dancers she was interviewing--were teaching this DVD instead of Sonia.  I wanted to learn more!  Overall, the most striking thing about this DVD is the similarities between belly dancing and Polynesian dance--and the dissimilarities of how the people of Tahiti embrace the dance of their culture and how dancing is forbidden or greatly looked down upon in the middle east.  To my knowledge, you wouldn't see a classroom full of girls  learning belly dancing in the middle east, whereas in Polynesian countries their dances are celebrated and a boon to the thriving tourism industry.  It makes me sad to think of the missionaries that came to the Polynesian islands made them stop dancing when a beautiful topless island girl dancing the hula and playing the ukelele on the beach makes for such an idyllic scene.  Wish I had the money go buy a plane ticket now!",1349136000,,1509,4.8515625
8204668,5,B000S86J40,"This is a down to earth, gorgous intructor! I have been focusing primarily on exotic dancing/belly dancing/tribal/ etc,. and I love the energy in this video! She's got the edge I've been needing to incorporate in all my routines....",1303776000,,232,4.9743589743589745
8204669,4,B000S86J40,"I got this DVD for the pure cultural experience.  But, once I heard those drums, I wanted to get moving. For someone with tight hips, the music and the dance movements were very enticing. During the technique section, Sonia demonstrates very slowly and explains in detail. Not all the moves were easy, mainly because my hips are tight!!! The DVD is packed with options which is highly recommended to view all of it-very entertaining.

TECHNIQUES show you 7 hip movements. With a live percussion duo, Sonia faces a mirror and demonstrates.
COMBINATIONS has about 6 combinations that progresses to advanced moves such as a spin, traveling, turn, squat and pose.  Arms are shown rising up, to the sides, or the front. Done twice, Sonia will tell you what move is being done.
2 COOL-DOWNS one indoors and one outdoors along the water.
2 PERFORMANCES again, indoors and outdoors
DOCUMENTARY IN TAHITI WITH SONIA If you are familiar with INTRODUCTION TO POLYNESIAN DANCE with Tumata, that's where the majority of this section is filmed. Side to side comparison of Polynesian with Sonia's Bellydancing.
Plus BONUS tracks

Overall, a generally good basic introduction to this type of fusion dance, but for authenticity, see INTRODUCTION TO POLYNESIAN DANCE with Tumata.",1275436800,,1261,5.0772946859903385
8204670,4,B000S86J40,"first let me say that I ordered this dvd on another site - it is listed for the same price here and has some cover.  my dvd came with bonus interviews and a cd of music from the ballet de tahiti -tamatu's polynesian dance ensemble.  with these added features I feel this dvd is a good value, since the cd alone would probably cost $10 or more.

Sonia, a bellydancer, takes you through several tahitian dance moves, sometimes explaining how the movement is similar or different than a bellydance move.  she also explores this further in a bonus interview with one of the ensemble's dancers.  the main section has a warm up, takes you through different key steps, as mentioned above, and then you learn a choreography, strangely she has you do a cool down before you practice this choreography in its entirety, once in the studio and again with sonia who is in full costume.  if you study tahitian dance and are determined to obtain all the dvds out there, get this because you will have another choreography to practice.",1252800000,,1019,4.602209944751381
8204671,2,B000S86J40,"I gave this DVD a chance because I was hoping for a good introduction to Polynesian dance for people who already bellydance. For some reason, that's what I got out of the description. Well, that's not what it is at all.

It's a list of very basic bellydance moves, with a few of what I assume to be basic Polynesian dance moves tacked on at the end (Although they look just like bellydance moves like hip circles and figure 8s.) (???) There is no real TEACHING of these moves -- they're really just demonstrated. So I kept having to ask myself, ""what's the difference between this and a figure 8"" or ""what's the diff between this and a pelvic circle? It looks slightly different, but what is it?""

Is there a difference between the Polynesian step she teaches and a plain old generic hip circle? I still don't know. Is the accent different? Does it use different muscles? Don't know! That's never covered. All the moves ""taught"" on this dvd are common to any beginner level bellydance dvd, including the one the BDSS produced! If you have that DVD, you don't need this one.

I also expected there to be a section about common Polynesian rhythms or something about the drumming and music. (We know how important the rhythm is to bellydance, so I assumed the same might be true of Polynesian.) I still don't know because nothing like that was mentioned.

The dvd ends with a series of ""combinations."" I think this is probably the lamest part. It was like she threw out a deck of cards with moves written on them and just grabbed a handful from the deck. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the way they were put together, and there was no discussion about the movements fitting the music/drum beats.

Of the Bellydance Superstars dvd instructors, Sonia is my least favorite. You can't create a beginner level DVD and just expect to throw out terms like ""glutes"" and expect people to know WHICH part of the glute to use, or even how to do so! I spent months trying to figure out how to use my ""glutes"" for hip work -- without a live instructor poking you, it's hard to know which muscles to use.

This could have been a REALLY good dvd, but they didn't go to the effort to make it so. Too bad.",1195344000,23,2195,4.420792079207921
8204672,1,B000S86J40,"I really had high hopes for this dvd but, sadly, it failed on all levels. The instruction is presented the completely outdated ""follow my hips"" format with Sonia doing a move but offering few - if any - descriptions of exactly how one is to DO what she just demonstrated. She also zips along from one thing to the next at a rapid pace. There is very little repetition making it it impossible to get anything into your muscle memory. This means keeping your dvd controller handy at all times so you can hit reverse and go back over the moves. Again and again and again. This is a major flaw in almost all of the BDSS instructional dvds and is extremely annoying.

One of the worst aspects of this dvd is the inability to distinguish what style Sonia is actually dancing in. One would think there would be a way to tell which dance style is which by watching Sonia cooly demonstrate the moves but there is really no way to do so. I've been belly dancing for 5+ years and ALL of the moves look exactly like belly dance moves set to Polynesian drums. Thinking I was just being my usual hyper-criticle self, I showed this dvd to a friend who is a professional Hula/Polynesian dancer and SHE couldn't tell the difference. Boy, did I ever feel vidicated!

Was are also never given any in depth explanations as to which moves are bellydance, which are Polynesian and which are ""bellynesian"". Nor does Sonia offer clear descriptions as to how the dance styles differ from each other. The subject is skimmed over as if it is of no importance whatsoever.  Something that couldn't be farther from the truth. If you are going to ""fuse"" two vastly different dance styles and do it WELL, one needs to know exacty what it is they are fusing. Without knowing the distinct difference between belly dance and Polynesian dance all you are going to have is confusion not ""bellynesian fusion"".  You are also in danger of insulting another culture. Here is a link to an article concerning just that: [...]

BTW, just throwing in my two cents here but enough of the ""belly-fusing"" already. Just because the world is full of varying dance styles doesn't mean they should all be combined with belly dance. It's getting bizarre. I mean, what's next ""Belly Square Dance Fusion"" or ""Belly Clog Dance Fusion""???? I'm sorry to go off on a tangent but I had to get that off my chest.

Anyway, back to the original subject of this review: the ""Intro to Bellynesian"" dvd. When it comes to getting a chance to practice what Sonia has ""taught"" we are offered some combos to work with. Unfortunately, the combos follow no clear or sensible pattern. They seem like nothing more than random dance moves, chosen without rhyme or reason and strung together haphazardly. (Amanda described the combos best in her review) Yes, the combos will get you moving but they would have been much nicer they had a smooth flow. As presented, the combos felt jumbled and out of synch.

While Sonia is a talented dancer and certainly lovely to look at, she seems totally detached and uninvolved in the dance. There is simply no passion in what she is doing. Sonia's lack of expression makes it hard for me to relate to her as an instructor or become emotionally involved in her performances.

And speaking of the performances; this dvd lists TWO dance performances by Sonia but, in reality, it is the exact same dance performed in two different settings (one indoors and one outside in a lovely, palm grove). Thinking I was imagining things, I made my husband watch the performances twice just to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me. He agreed that both dances are completely identicle. All I can say is what a rip off! Mile Copeland certainly could have included a couple of different performances by Sonia instead of offering a rehash of only one dance. I'm quite sure that Sonia knows more than one ""bellynesian"" routine so what gives??

It also would have been nice to include at least one or two authentic Polynesian dance performances (done by real Polynesians!) so the viewers could see the how TRUE Polynesian dance varies from this new fangled ""bellynesian"" fusion thing. I guess that was too much to ask for.

The best thing about this dvd was the bonus cd of lovely Polynesian music that was included so at least I got something for the rather hefty price I paid. I still listen to the cd frequently. The dvd was donated to the Thrift Shop long, long ago.",1191801600,19,4414,4.604325699745547
8204673,4,B000S86J40,"Nice dvd to add to your collection. There's nothing really new, but it's a nice reminder that all dance forms have common moves, and moves that can be used in other formats. Polynesian dancing has moves that can easily translate into belly dance to add dimension and variety.
Great footage of the islands and some beautiful scenery!",1191369600,6,332,4.842105263157895
