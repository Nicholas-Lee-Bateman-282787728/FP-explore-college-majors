1349293,3,B00004T3BP,"SEE former child evangelist MARJOE GORTNER as an ordinary Joe who gets involved in a dangerous DRUG SMUGGLING scheme in beautiful HAWAII! This is movie made especially for the DRUG CULTURE circa 1974! This movie actually played as a DOUBLE-FEATURE with that CHEECH & CHONG epic, ""Up in Smoke!"" There must be HUNDREDS of things you could do with your money that would be more enjoyable than WATCHING this film!",1001808000,,409,4.857142857142857

This  is still an interesting circa-70's pseudo-documentary.",1510012800,,103,5.8
7922322,4,B00004T3BP,"Got the wrong Acapulco Gold at first. If you want the film with Gortner and Lansing, order the one with the girl in a bikini on thr cover. So glad I got this. It is a little, clearly much was cut that would have explained character, but Gortner shows that he has talent, and Lansing is terrific. The editor would later twice be nominated for an Oscar. It is fun with some clever dialogue.",1466208000,,388,4.256756756756757
7922323,1,B00004T3BP,"Not the classic 70s movie! It's some mediocre documentary from the 80s early 90s.
Pass.",1462665600,,87,4.866666666666666
7922324,1,B00004T3BP,Just got ripped off. This movie is not the movie described that was in Hawaii. And not link to return or report.,1439683200,,112,4.136363636363637
7922325,3,B00004T3BP,"Find Marjoe interesting and purchased it because he was in it, but it's a pretty bad movie (though I've seen much worse).  Still after watching him in the Gun and the Pulpit i was expecting better from (but then he wasn't in charge, hollywood was). Oh well. It's a conversation peice.",1402358400,,284,4.568627450980392
7922326,1,B00004T3BP,"Be careful what you order, they list the dvd Acapulco gold with the sticker  ""the epic 1970's Party Pic"" on the front of the dvd and you think its the movie with Marjo Gortner and its a ruse, its just a flick about growing pot.  So, buyer beware, I just got ripped off.

7922327,5,B00004T3BP,"This movie is a bit weird to keep up with, so you'll probably have to watch it twice to really ""get it"".  But, whether you get it or not, it's a pretty cool movie.",1362700800,,163,3.7941176470588234
7922328,3,B00004T3BP,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM as I'm a Robert Lansing fan since my early teens, and because he had said in an interview I read on the net that he had enjoyed making this film. I liked the Hawaian landscape, the scenes on the sea and Mr. Lansing's performance, as he was an excellent actor, playing a part that is not what we were used to seeing him play, which I liked. The image definition is not the best,and the plot isn't the best either, but anyway  I consider the film enjoyable.",1348704000,,477,4.241758241758242
7922329,3,B00004T3BP,"In the television version of Twelve O'Clock High, Robert Lansing proved to be among the most effective TV actors of his day. While this was  not a ""made for TV"" film, you might consider it such since it resembles the average of the early 70's when it was made. The cast, including Lansing, is given little to do  and does that  little with a modicum of skill. There are some good ocean views and Hawaiian scenery, For the rest, it is not an unpleasant hour and a half with which to while away the time when your mind is otherwise occupied or you are just too tired to sleep. There is some action, some quite mild suspense, some comedy. All in all, a decent time-filler.",1257811200,2,669,4.336
7922330,1,B00004T3BP,"My husband was in this movie.  He grades it as a ""5 star"" but that his ego.  He says that while it's not the greatest movie, not everyone can say they were actually in a movie.  He played a mexican federal cop.
The Acapulco Gold version he was in was made in Hawaii.",1010016000,,266,3.981132075471698
