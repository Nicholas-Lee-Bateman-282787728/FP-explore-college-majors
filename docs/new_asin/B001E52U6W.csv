8296370,3,B001E52U6W,"Nixon from 1967, after he was VP, after he ""lost"" the 1960 Prez election, after he lost CA gubernatorial election in 62, and before he was elected in 68 and his smashing victory in 72. Important to keep all of that in mind.

It's also interesting how completely oblivious they are to the time bombs that go off in 68. It's like hearing people talk about national security challenges on 9/10/2001.

They talk political strategy. It's not a biography on Nixon. They don't even talk issues. The video is about how to frame issues to the public and how to win elections when the other side is Santa Claus.

Nixon's really smart. He points out a lot of things that conservatives struggle with still today. Nixon had no charisma and it's a little shocking he ever won any elections, much less the biggest landslide in fairly recent history. This video shows you how he did it. He simply understands regular folks and what they need to hear.

I know they like to make him out to be the devil, but Nixon was a pretty normal guy. He's not grandiose or pretentious like a lot of leaders from those days and from Firing Line.",1385164800,4,1114,4.472906403940887
8296371,5,B001E52U6W,"Back in the day, political discussions on Firing Line were presented without the vitriolic, hysterical, and slanted rants that pass for conversation on Television shows today.  Richard Nixon and William F. Buckley discuss the future of the Republican Party as well as then topical issues such as the disenchantment with LBJ.  Ironically, Richard Nixon became President, won the biggest re-election mandate in history but lost support from many people including Republican leaders, because of the Watergate scandal.

 But this is seven years before the rise and fall of President Nixon, and he is as bright, outspoken, and even mentions FDR as a good salesman for the Democrats.  One of the books that came out after Nixon's election was called ""The Selling of the President.""  Television and Social Media have been the tools of spin doctors who handle style.  The ""new Nixon"" had a team that showed the future President as a ""fun guy,"" who could appear on the then-smash hit, ""Laugh-In.""  In later years, ""Saturday Night Live"" would show him as a fool, satirizing ""The Final Days.""

Of historical note, Mr. Nixon does not see the Wallace campaign as playing a major role in the 1968 election, but the defection of the Dixiecrats gave George Wallace 15 percent of the vote, contributing to the defeat of Hubert Humphrey (not even mentioned on this show). Buckley discusses Ronald Regan as a future candidate for the White House, and that happened. Bobby Kennedy's name that comes up in conversation because of the split between LBJ and Kennedy.  At this point in history, Johnson hadn't announced that he would not seek re-election, nor did anyone know that RFK would be a potential candidate, then a victim of an assassin.

Politics had changed drastically between the 1920s and 1930s, and even more greatly from the '60s to our current time.  We need more people like William Buckley who can debate and examine issues with some objectivity, instead of entire television networks that present a Right Wing or Left Wing approach.",1377388800,2,2028,5.002976190476191

8296373,5,B001E52U6W,"Okay...this is from a program a year prior to Nixon's election as President...he is rehabilitating himself not only from the  defeat by JFK for President but also the crushing defeat for Governor  of California where he said...you won't have Dick Nixon to kick around! Knowing what we do about the rest of this man's history and our own , watching this program is a stunning revelation...I enjoyed it very much.  The quality of the video was broadcast and first rate!  Recommended to history buffs and political junkies.",1247443200,8,520,4.942528735632184
