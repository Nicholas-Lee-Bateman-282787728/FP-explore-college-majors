8440340,5,B001ORQSHM,"I recently saw a screening of this timely documentary movie at OSU's Hatfield Marine Science theater in Newport, OR and the audience response was very enthusiastic.  This extremely thorough cinema verite interview style movie, attempts to present all sides of the issue, including those few who declined to be interviewed. Although this is an historical documentary, the subject and issues are timeless and relevant.

The gamut of issues and viewpoints are represented along with the follies, fickles and personalities of political, legal maneuvering.  It does a great job of presenting the drama, complexities and zeitgeist of the times. Matt Love is wonderful at providing the narrative and insights that hold it all together.  Thanks Matt for your clear, honest and personally enlightened perspectives.  Obviously an inspired labor of love by the team of Matt and the director Tom Olsen; the end result of 3 years of careful interviewing, researching and final editing of mountains of documents, records and interviews; great over-view invites further research to fully understand the  legal, political, personal and environmental issues surrounding public/private property rights and the role responsible government should take.

The ""Politics of Sand"" provides many insights into the historical-political-social complexities and the drama of change vs the status quo.  This documentary deserves multiple viewings and further research to fully understand and learn about all the complex issues, politics and personalities presented; this valuable documentary provides a great foundation for further study.

With all the issues surrounding our current land use and population growth, I'm hoping for a sequel (using unused resource materials not included in this movie) to present further insight towards maintaining and protecting Oregon's environment.  Thank you Matt and Tom (and their team) for continuing to promote and share their vision and truth.",1241481600,,1956,5.690721649484536
8440341,5,B001ORQSHM,Politics of Sand is simply a must see for anyone who has ever recreated on Oregon's publicly-owned beaches. To think that the forces of private development almost prevailed over the public interest regarding our ocean beaches is terrifying to say the least. Tom Olsen has performed an invaluable service in making this fine documentary. Every elected official in Oregon should see it.,1235001600,,384,5.209677419354839
