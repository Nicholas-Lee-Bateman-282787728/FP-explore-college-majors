2604809,5,B000GDH9IW,Wow!!! What an amazing film!!! Vandamme gives a knockout performance in this finely directed film!!! Sheldon Lettich has outdone the expectations for this movie with a final product that is WAY ABOVE par for a DTV action film. Character development that far surpasses that of most films of this genre. The action scenes were quite nice and this movie left nothing to be yerned for. Awesome!!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!! Worthy of Theatrical release for sure!!!!!,1155859200,4,458,5.202702702702703
2604810,2,B000GDH9IW,"I am one of the biggest Van Damme fans and his movies continually let me down of late. The current case in point is The Hard Corps. If you have seen The Bodyguard (Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston) you have seen a much better movie, than this low budget rehash.

The movie's plot, actor's performances (or lack thereof), and the poor DVD package (only special features are other direct-to-dvd movies, and not even the trailer for this movie), make this a rental only.

Van Damme plays an ex-soldier from Desert Storm and he is hired to be a bodyguard to a former boxer, now community leader. He doesn't want Van Damme's protection, but his sister does (played by Vivica Fox--what happened to her since Kill Bill?). There are some fight scenes involving a rap mogul (yes, how could anyone make this up) whom the boxer had sent to prison years earlier, now that he has been released. Drive-by shootings and house break-in attacks sum up the plot. Van Damme is playing very low key, lacking the charisma he showed in his youth. He is not bad, but not good either. For fans looking for a lot of martial arts, you won't find it. A few punches and kicks, but nothing any more spectacular than what he did in Second In Command.

If this is the best Van Damme can do these days, I suggest a retirement. Then maybe when he is in his 50's, he can come back like Arnold and Sly. Who knows. Do yourself a favor, do not expect anything but a B-movie action film.",1155772800,2,1450,4.4232209737827715

2604851,3,B000GDH9IW,"The Hard Corps (2006) has Van Damme playing an ex special force solider, Phillip Sauvage, who is hired as a bodyguard to the former World Heavyweight boxing champion, Wayne Barclay. Years before, Wayne had helped the rap mogul Terrell Singletery get sent to prison, but now the rapper is out and he wants revenge.

The Hard Corps is another Van Damme film that I have never heard of before and is less action-packed and more of a thug drama. Besides from Van Damme and Vivica A. Fox, the acting is not great and neither is the direction of the film. The plot is interesting and the action scenes, the few that there are, are entertaining.",1351900800,,638,4.547826086956522
2604852,3,B000GDH9IW,"With ""The Hard Corps"", Jean-Claude Van Damme continued his trend of being a step above Seagal and Lundgren when it came to the technical and dramatic quality of their vehicles. In what would be his last film to-date to be directed by longtime collaborator Sheldon Lettich (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionheart/dp/0783228465/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionheart</a>), Van Damme made his somewhat-overdue venture into ""urban"" film - a movie with a predominantly black cast and an environment wherein he is the minority - with pleasantly smooth results. The only major drawback is that the even storyline and decent acting seem to have come at the expense of the movie's action content, which isn't nearly as abundant as I would've preferred.

The story: veteran soldier Philippe Sauvage (Van Damme) is employed as the bodyguard of a charismatic boxer-turned-entrepreneur (Raz Adoti,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amistad/dp/0783231202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amistad</a>) threatened by a vengeful music producer and crime lord he helped incarcerate (Viv Leacock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spy/dp/B000085EFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spy</a>).

The movie opens with a bit of gratuitous slow-motion, and the occasional flashbacks to Philippe's army memories have a vaguely out-of-place feel to them, but beyond that, the film definitely looks better than a lot of other DTV offerings. For a low-budget production, the script by director Lettich and George Saunders (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-4-The-Dark-Kumite/dp/6305388539/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite</a>) is remarkably big on character examination and relationship development, particularly between Van Damme's and Raz Adoti's characters. For the most part, the acting is good, with Vivica Fox (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>) as Adoti's sister/manager particularly standing out for her confidence, but surprisingly, Van Damme seems to phone in a performance this time around, seemingly making less of an effort (and definitely less of an impression) than the films he had made in the recent past and would in the near future.

The hand-to-hand centerpiece of the movie is a mutual grudge fight between Van Damme and Adoti, which isn't fantastic but is good for what it is. The rest of the action is composed of two major shootouts (this may be the first time Van Damme wields an Uzi) and a couple uneven fights, including a disappointing wrestling match between Van Damme and top henchman Ron Selmour (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-Hospital/dp/B001TH37S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom Hospital</a>). Though their quality isn't outstanding, I wouldn't have minded seeing a greater quantity of fistfights - I mean, you'd think there'd be more by default, with both a martial artist and a boxer in the cast of characters. Fans who can get caught up in the story will probably be fine with what's there, and though even I can envision myself giving the movie a higher rating on account of the drama on a better day, this isn't one of them. More action, Sheldon.

""The Hard Corps"" enjoys a surprisingly long runtime, going on two hours. This gives the movie a chance to stretch the legs of its storyline a bit, but folks who can't find particular enjoyment in it will probably think the film drags. I wouldn't say that the movie is shockingly different from a lot of other Van Damme fare, but I definitely think some fans will appreciate it over others.

2604857,4,B000GDH9IW,"The Hard Corps(2006)is a decent action movie with alot of suspense and thrills galore,that still stands up well. It features a majority of black actors and all,along with its' principal star,do a good job of creating and sustaining the tense atmosphere that permeates the film.
The story immerses us into the world of gang violence,rivalries and revenge courtesy of its' main nemesis Terrell Singeltery(Viv Leacock).He is a rapper(with a nod to Notrious B.I.G)who has been doing time in prison for murder when he is suddenly let out for good behaviour only part way into his sentence. Heavyweight champion boxer Wayne Barkley(Razaaq Adoti)is worried because he is the one whose evidence was used to put him away in the first place;for the murder of his younger brother. He knows Terrell will be out for revenge...and he is right. Doubly worried is his sister and manager Tamara(Vivica Fox)who insists on tighter and more thorough security for her brother. Their current security head recommends an ex Vietnam and Iran/Afganistan vet and friend Clarence Bowden(Julian Christopher)to head it up. Clarence arrives with Phillip Sauvage(Van Damme)in tow,also a vet of the Afgan/Iraq war but still suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.
The two men's real first test of security comes at a disco where Barkley is attending. All goes fairly smoothly until the party leaves and they are attacked. Bowden is unexpectedly killed in the fire fight and Sauvage is asked to remain on to form a new security team. He makes inquiries of several of his former vets but only one comes to join him. Barkley takes him to the boxing club where he got his start and asks Sauvage to pick the remainder of his team from them. Reluctantly Sauvage is forced to acquiesce.
Terrell isn't a happy rapper with those that have failed him. In a particularly scary and bloody moment while feeding his kenneled dogs,his first henchman kills one of the young men who failed in the first attempt and feeds his body parts to the animals.
The next hit attempt comes one evening when Barkley,who has a girlfriend he often visits for""relaxation"",is visiting her home. The rappers hired men enter the home and have Barkley at a distinct disadvantage when Sauvage and his cohorts intervene and prevent his death.
Barkley is next scheduled for a public appearance at an auditorium with the city mayor. Sauvage and his team thwart yet another attempt but subdue the wrong man,Terrell's head henchman. It goes public and Barkley is embarrassed beyond words and lets Sauvage go. It seems the same police lieutenant who had been investigating all of the attempts on Barkley's life also had been dissing Sauvage. He plants the story in Barkley's head that Sauvage was actually drummed out of the army for killing innocent civilians,namely children. That lie coupled with the embarrassment of the moment leads to Barkley's decision. When Barkley refuses to pay what he owes Sauvage the two meet in the gym and fight it out. At a stand still at one point,Barkley's security head enters to say his sister has been kidnapped. Then Barkley receives an urgent call from his girlfriend to come to her place alone. There he finds the police lieutenant,who it seems has been working for Terrell all along. He is to take Barkley to Terrell but again Sauvage and company intervene and the team goes to Terrell's on their own terms. Once there the final battle of the movie plays itself out;Terrell and Barkley duke it out while Sauvage and his team rescue Tamara. It is touch and go as the action goes back and forth but eventually the good guys finally win the day.
Barkley gets his sister back and his sister gets a new love interest....Sauvage,of course!
Well written and played the movie moves along at a decent pace with few slowdowns throughout its' 110 minute run. It is a solid cast all around and Van Damme plays his character of the stress affected vet quite well. There are some very violent moments and Ron Selmour as Terrell's #1 henchman Simcoe,casts a very menacing and effective presence throughout.
Technically speaking the DVD is in a 1:85:1 aspect ratio and is quite clear and crisp. Besides the trailer and some previews there is nothing extra in this release.
An above average action flick for the fans of Jean Claude and I recommend it.",1272326400,,4308,4.902739726027397

2604869,3,B000GDH9IW,"The Hard Corps (2006) is an off-beat, mildly amusing action feature, that makes a bid for the hip hop audience.  Action star Jean-Claude Van Damme is Philippe Sauvage, an ex-soldier, now doing personal security work.  Retired boxer Wayne Barclay (Razaaq Adoti), needs protection, when Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock), a man he helped send to prison, is released early.  Reluctantly hired by Barclay's sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox), Sauvage is given complete control over Barclay's security, after he saves the fighter's life in an attempted hit.

Sauvage's assembled team of bodyguards play to mixed reviews, as they foil another attempt on Barclay's life, but the results are not as good at a rally, where the bodyguards apparently take down an innocent man.  Barclay likes doing things his way, with his emotions often getting the better of him.  Singletery is determined to see Barclay dead, and when he abducts Tamara, it sets the stage for a cartoonish final showdown, which features more of Adoti's fighting skills than Van Damme's.

The film is written and directed by Sheldon Lettich.  A frequent collaborator with Van Damme, Lettich also wrote and directed Lionheart (1990), and Double Impact (1991), which featured Dennis Rodman.  An action feature that was not meant to be realistic or taken seriously, The Hard Corps mixes gunplay, with a bit of fighting, and a sprinkle of race based humor.

2604872,4,B000GDH9IW,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1.  Who is he? He's a hallucination-prone, recovering alcoholic, troubled former U.S. soldier Phillippe Sauvage who served in Afghanistan and a few times in Iraq.
2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged? His former Sergeant Major, with whom he served multiple tours, was killed in a shootout.
3.  Does he take his shirt off? Unbelievably, it doesn't happen.
4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress? It was probably a deleted scene (or will be in the sequel), but JCVD hit the jackpot in this one and he hooked up with Tamara Barclay (Vivica A. Fox).  C-List?  Pshaw!!
5.  Is there a tournament? He trains several novice bodyguards like there is going to be a tournament, but it's just to protect the champ.
6.  Is training needed for this tournament? In a surprise twist, JCVD trains others!
7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  The actual splits aren't done, but in the penultimate battle, he does a kick that exposes ""Big Jim and the Twins"" to the enemy - close enough.
8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  No, but one of Wayne's booty-call girls field-goals a thug's balls somewhere near his esophagus.
9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  Good ol' JCVD, he had me going for a while.  He saved the 360-goodness for the very end.
10.  Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly.  A group of ignorant thugs who hold their pistols sideways do not a formidable enemy make.
11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being fragile and suffering from PTSD, there are no real injuries of which to speak.
12.  Does he win? He basically assassinates everyone; so, I'd call that a win.

A former boxer, Wayne Barclay, needs protection from a clich&eacute;-ridden Suge Knight wannabe.  Eventually, a battle-hardened Sauvage (JCVD sporting a huge, baseball-sized knot on his head throughout the movie) is hired and tasked to build his own security team.  The people he plans on hiring are the ""hardest of the hard corp,"" but that basically ends up being one former soldier buddy and a few people from Barclay's gym.

To summarize this movie, I'd borrow a line from Wayne: it's like ""pouring water on $*&# and calling it gravy"".  The convoluted plot, the stereotypical black characters, and the paint-by-numbers approach shouldn't work.  It should be ridiculous.  Adding JCVD's over-complicated character is brilliant.  It's never enough for JCVD to have a drinking problem in a movie; the character has to be riddled with problems and responsible for the My Lai Massacre in order for JCVD to bite.  Somehow, however, all of it together simply works.

As far as production value goes, it's slightly better than average for JCVD.  It steals bits from several other movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard/dp/B0006N2EZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Major-League/dp/B000M343BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Major League</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Brothers/dp/B000BDH6BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Brothers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-II/dp/B0006GAOG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky II</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Jack-City/dp/6305047480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Jack City</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Fever/dp/0783230389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Fever</a>) but ends up providing a relatively new, enjoyable experience.

2604876,5,B000GDH9IW,"Don't let the other reviews of this movie fool you. Some JCVD fans may be dissapointed due to the minimal martial arts scenes in this film. However, this is not a martial arts movie, it is a suspense drama movie that contains more acting and less fighting. With that in mind, I see this film as a transition for Van Damme who appears to be stepping away from martial arts films and stepping toward suspense movies.

Van Damme delivers an emotional yet highly entertaining
performance as a military veteran who is haunted by an accidental bombing of innocent civilians and many children by terrorists.  There are some flash back scenes which vividly show Van Damme's inner struggle to cope with the painful memory of war.
Vivica Fox manages her famous brother who is an ex-athlete turned business man. The bad guys want to ""eliminate"" Vivica's brother by any means neccessary. Basically, Van Damme is hired as a bodyguard to protect her brother from the bad guys.  That is where the movie takes a turn from action to drama. The supporting cast (including the bad guys) are believable. Also, there is a very shocking torture scene involving pitbulls!
Van Damme has truly ""stepped up to the acting plate"", so to speak.

I rate this movie 5 stars because of the gripping plot and as always, Van Damme shows that he is more than just an athlete & martial artist.  He is a highly skilled actor who I see making several more entertaining suspense dramas.",1194912000,,1447,4.703557312252965
2604877,4,B000GDH9IW,"Okay, firstly I'd rate this movie better if it had shown on BET and not been released as a dvd. The movie started off really great (except the low budget lighting or inconsistencies with). The plot is about an ex boxer who's not safe against a guy that wanted him to lose/win (i forgot isn't that bad!) so Vivica is the sister of the black retired boxer turned business owner needing protection from Van damme (who's crazy b/c he was in Iraq/Afghanistan). That back story should have been cut out. Of course the brother is hard headed so he's always getting close calls (which helps move the story even though that's dumb) Van damme doesn't do a split in this one.!!!

Negatives
the cover is kind of misleading to the storyline. I thought Vivica would be on the run and he needed to protect her (like that movie with William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford).

Not enough storyline to warrant why Vivica would date Van Dammme. but it's typical van damme so you have to just go with it. I would have included something else maybe a scene where they're after her, and then they hold each other. that would warrant the kiss at the end!!!

Okay movie! though definitely for BET channel. The first 40 minutes were great (except the lighting)",1188950400,,1230,4.5565610859728505
2604898,3,B000GDH9IW,"While Van Damme continues to pump out movies to this day, the martial arts edge has worn off to the aging star, and action movies are become basic action.  Fight scenes are more brawl-like than martial arts like, and gun fights seem to have taken more of role.  This is extremely true of the Hard Corps, a very enjoyable action movie that has good action, but even better suspense.  The acting and story itself are a bit weak, so this is a movie that is exciting the first time around, but may be difficult to watch over and over like the classic Van Damme films.

Van Damme plays an ex-army troubled army officer, hired to protect a huge boxer in town named Wayne Barclay, who is famous for his skills and for puttin away his nemesis, Terell, who is a big time rapper.  Terell gets out of jail and has revenge on his mind for the boxer.  Phillip (Van Damme) puts together a team known as the Hard Corps to protect the boxer, but thins don't go so smoothly.  There are a lot of scenes where Terell and his gang get real close to killing Wayne, creating lots of suspense.  There are not a huge amount of fights, but you get a few good brawls from the main characters.

This is a solid movie that is great to watch the first time around, especially if you love gang-type films with lots of rap for the soundtrack.  I can't see this being very exciting though the 2nd time watching, since the suspense was really the only element that stuck out.",1181865600,,1442,4.327137546468402

Is it martial arts or specializing in lousy movies. The most memorable thing for me was that very hot kiss at the end between Vivica Fox and Jean Claude. Now THAT is worth picking this movie up for.

2604900,2,B000GDH9IW,"I humbly admit that I am one of Jean Claude's biggest fans. From Cyborg to Replicant, I've stood by him and his array of slightly predictable yet wildly entertaining films. There were hiccups along the way such as Universal Soldier 2, Knock Off and Street Fighter, but overall, JC has put out some of the best action films of the late eighties and nineties.

Unfortunately, I think it's time he throws in the towel and retires from the cinematic limelight. Compared to some of his recent flops, The Hard Corps isn't horrible; it's just bad. The movie is a stretch to hold your attention. You really don't care due to the poor acting, poor script and poor direction of Sheldon Lettich. (BTW, Mr. Lettich knocked out such classics as Bloodsport and Kickboxer, but he has hit the wall in terms of creativity.) Van Damme is known for his martial arts, but the last several films have portrayed him as too old to do what got him to where he is. Maybe he can't do the splits anymore; maybe he can't do a roundhouse anymore, and maybe we just couldn't care less anymore. Where are the vintage scenes from Timecop or Hard Target? These low-budget, B-movie excuses for plot-line are not only painful but boring. It's not even action any more when you can predict the next scene before it happens.

Thanks for reading my review.",1168646400,6,320,4.517241379310345
2604902,4,B000GDH9IW,"Ok. I'll be honest with you. Its not Van Damme's best. I don't think he will have another film as great as the dizzy heights of Timecop or Hard Target. Please people, remember this is a direct to video film produced with a budget of under fifteen million US dollars and has a team of lackluster producers behind it which need all the help they can get from the ever-commited stars.

Whilst I make these small points in the films defense it does have its problems. Van Damme seems to want to make films which are realistic, gritty and act well in them but the way he chooses to play the character is very strange. The character is virtually a walking zombie until he gets a gun in his hand or a tingle in his fists. But I'll give him my respect because you are a lot more suspicious of the character and Van Damme gives a sense of mystery to him. But then there is the action side of things as with any Van Damme film they come exciting but infrequent due to a running time of nearly two hours and relationships between teh characters more complicated than a Rubix cube. However, the action is swift and flowing and well directed and though there are not too many high kicks because Van Damme is playing a war-torn soldier and it would not suit his character, a few trademark kicks are thrown in to please the fans. The cool guns and the shoot first, ask questions later attitude of the characters remind me of the 80's action movies loaded with cheese and enough bullets to load every gun in the world once.

Overall the film is very nice visually with stunning colours, good actors and the right amount of chemistry between them. It also has gritty fist fights, sparkling gun fights and an ever so slightly disappointing conclusion.

Well, that's me finished rambling and when I started out writing this review I promised myself that I wouldn't go on with my own views on the movie industry and inject pointless lines which I think are witty into it but - I have done it.

I'm not going to tell you to buy this film. You can decide that for yourself. But if you do buy it - enjoy.

Thanks for reading my review!",1167868800,,2112,4.363867684478372
2604903,1,B000GDH9IW,"I really enjoyed Jean-Claude's earlier films.  But, they keep seeming to get worse and worse.  The dude kicked like 3 times in the film.  The best part of Jean-Claude's films are the fight scenes and these sucked.  You know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap!  I'm really hoping he'll get with Steven Segal talk about how much they both suck, watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots!",1163030400,5,482,4.558139534883721

2604905,5,B000GDH9IW,"I thought the movie was great! Van Damme is not getting any younger he's getting older and well maybe he can't kick like he use to. But he is a very sincere actor. I have seen greater performances in his earlier movies. I give him credit, he's still kicking butt and he has a darn good angle when he kicks. Any true fan would not put an actor down. Give me a break he's only human. Jean-Claude Van Damme you are a great actor in my book. Although I would like to see you play more in a love scene movie. That kiss you did with Vivica A. Fox was great!!!! Stay strong baby.",1160352000,,572,4.026315789473684
2604906,1,B000GDH9IW,"Van Damme will keep making these awful pictures until fans like me quit buying them, I quit.

The shame is that his new movies are most likely watched by his fans and yet very little in them appeals to fans, IMO. Why?",1157846400,4,217,4.166666666666667
2604907,3,B000GDH9IW,"Jean Claude Van Damme plays an ex-soldier who takes a job as a bodyguard for an ex-boxer and businessman who is threatened by a rap artist who has just been released from prison.

While this is not a great movie, not as good as ""In Hell"", it's entertaining enough and a step up from Van Damme's previous movie, ""Second in Command"". Van Damme fans should enjoy it.",1156032000,8,363,4.417910447761194
