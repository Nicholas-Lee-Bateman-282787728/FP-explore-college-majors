8640529,5,B00IAXZ9QO,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event being their traditional two night ""All Star Weekend"" event & with Amazon not separating each night's show, I'll review them both here.

Night One:
Chris Hero returned for the first time in almost two years to challenge P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole in a competitive match with both men trading momentum both in & outside of the ring along with the return of something that Hero carries very close to him.  The other members of Mount Rushmore (Kevin Steen & Young Bucks) took on the team of A.R. Fox & Inner City Machine Guns in a very fast paced non-stop action match that saw Kevin Steen wear an outfit you had to see to believe as this match was filled with some insane high flying moves that had bodies flying all over the place in & out of the ring.  Davey Richards faced off against Johnny Gargano with some moments between both men that had the crowd chanting ""This Is Sexy!"" in a very strong wrestling match that saw them use everything from submissions to aerial offense to just impactful moves.  Other matches include Brian Cage vs. Anthony Nese in a hard hitting encounter; Drake Younger vs. Tomasso Ciampa that started with one man getting jumped on before the bell & never letting up with some stiff hits & brawling through the crowd; a ""power & size vs. speed & agility"" match with ACH vs. Michael Elgin; Dojo Bros vs. Best Friends that had some funny moments starting at the ring introductions & throughout the match that saw both teams trade momentum & unique tag team combination; and RockNES Monsters vs. Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae that was very entertaining to say the least.

Night Two:
P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole defended his championship against Johnny Gargano who made it clear that ""I'm going to break your arm!"" with Gargano beating Cole at his own game bite & attempting to break fingers with the action being very competitive in the ring with various submissions & on the outside sacrificing themselves just to hurt the other man while fighting around the building including the womens bathroom.  The one of the big news stories going into this night was the final performance of Davey Richards facing off against Ricochet in a match that saw both men showing each other up throughout the match while Davey was working a grounded submission style & Ricochet wrestling a more grounded wrestling style that we're used to from him but still relying on his speed & athleticism along with aerial ability.  Davey's ""American Wolves"" partner Eddie Edwards also participated in his final P.W.G. match teaming with his other tag team partner in Roderick Strong against A.R. Fox & Rich Swann that saw the Dojo Bros before more aggressive & vicious than we've seen them before with a modified doomsday device executed on the outside in the opening minute with both men working over the moments with such moves like a train of chops on both men & superplexing one partner onto the other which caused Swann & Fox to pick up the intensity as well.  Other matches include Mount Rushmore (Kevin Steen & Young Bucks) teaming against Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae & Drake Younger that saw Drake almost bring down the house...literally with everyone having their own superkick party at one point; Best Friends vs. Unbreakable F'n Machines in a competitive match that saw an unexpected ""family reunion""; Chris Hero vs. ACH with Hero having a response to what a fan said the previous night & showing something ""big"" he learned while he was away in Florida; Tomasso Ciampa vs. Anthony Nese in a match so intense that Ciampa wasn't able to take off his vest until after the opening minutes & the photographer at ringside actually got scared for his life; and RockNES Monsters vs. PPRay vs. Willie Mack & B-Boy in fast paced non-stop action that saw enemies work together against a common enemy with one big move after another while also having some fun from Excalibur having issues announcing one team's name to the fans worshiping ""Sexy Jesus.""

Night one was a strong show from P.W.G. as usual that as usual gave you strong wrestling along with some funny & entertaining moments (I was out of breath laughing at Kevin Steen's outfit alone).  Night two was a stronger event than night one as you did get your various strong styles of wrestling & entertainment but also the emotional farewell of two men who really made strong names for themselves in this company so this is one show I would go out of my way to see & enjoy.",1393804800,,4771,4.758162031438936
