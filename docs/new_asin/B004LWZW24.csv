4408506,5,B004LWZW24,"This movie was wonderful in the theater.  It was one scary movie!  I was mighty pleased and left the show still with chills up my back for about 5 minutes!  I would most definitely watch it again, even though I know what happens.

A family of 5 (Mom, Dad, 2 young boys, and a baby girl) moves into a new house (not newly built, just new to them).  From the very beginning, there are ""little"" unsettling things, which are not necessarily anything bizarre. Duncan (age 8 ?) wakes up telling Mom, ""I don't like my room"".  Books placed on a shelf are found on the floor.  The baby girl seems to cry a lot (but then babies tend to do that).

Things seem to escalate fairly quickly after Duncan falls in the somewhat spooky attic, seemingly ok but slipping into a coma during the night.  Fast-forward 3 months.  Duncan is still in a coma but is back home.  Mom is downstairs and begins to hear indiscernible voices on the baby monitor.

The scary stuff continues to escalate when Mom realizes something is WRONG!--it just ain't normal!  Even moving to another house does not help!  (Uh oh--real bad sign.) She talks to her mother-in-law (Barbara Hershey), who has a friend Elise  and her paranormal investigators who just might be able to help.

The story is about demons, unsettled ""bad"" spirits, possession, and astral travel.  I absolutely DO NOT recommend you allow your impressionable children to see this movie.  I found this flick pretty scary.  If you have any doubt as to your children seeing it, I suggest you see it first.  And by the way,

Don't play on the Astral Plane . . .(unless you really know what you are doing.)",1302912000,19,1626,4.537931034482758
4408507,4,B004LWZW24,"The Review:

From the makers of Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 comes a new horror movie, Insidous, starring Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne.  The Paranormal Activity people have not lost their touch and Insidious is an excellent example of how to make a scary movie without having to overly rely on creating a gorefest. Rather, Insidious opts for creating and sustaining tension, playing the audience masterfully.  You'll jump just when Insidious` creators want you to jump and you'll scream just when they want you to scream. Watch it in the right frame of mind and with a good audience and you'll be creeped out.

As with Paranormal Activity, Insiduous takes the haunted house genre and combines it with the demon possessed child genre, a la Omen and the Exorcist. It throws in a pinch of A Nightmare on Elm Street and the result is something unique and extremely entertaining for devotees of the horror genre. It's clever and offers important new wrinkles for how our protagonists are supposed to deal with their situation.  One can move out of a haunted house, but one cannot easily move away from a haunted family member.

Insidous centers around the Lambert Family: Josh, Renai, Dalton and Foster.  At first there's nothing about this family that marks them as abnormal, but as things progress it becomes clear that there is a very dark cloud hanging over them.  As with the folks in Paranormal Activity, the classic signs of a house haunting begin when the Lambert family moves into their new home.  Things move around, strange noises come out of the baby monitor and shadows seem to have a life of their own.  Mom, and the kids seem to notice these things first and Dad is determined to rationalize away these strange happenings.  Things progress to a point that even Josh cannot deny the evidence any longer.  Without giving too much away, there are indeed supernatural forces at play and they have not settled upon the Lambert clan by mere chance.

Insidious succeeds because you are on the same journey of discovery as the Lambert family.  You learn alongside them answers to the question, why them? And the further you go, the more insidious their problems appear, hence the film's title.  Another winner from the makers of Paranormal Activity.  If you are easily creeped out, then think twice about this seeing this movie.  While nothing will ever creep me out as much the little girl from The Ring, Insidous left me leaving on an extra light or two around the apartment, and very thankful that I don't live in a creepy old house.

4408508,4,B004LWZW24,"Wow...the team of James Wan, Leigh Winell, and Oren Pelli are awesome here! The makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw do very well with this great horror film. It's pg-13, but it works here. No blood, gore, torture porn stuff to be found anywhere! The torture is all psychological...a thinking person's horror film. The musical score is excellent....pretty original...not that teen slasher cheesy long chase music. LOL! I really appreciate the old school ""less is more"" approach that the first part of the film provides. Extremely atmospheric and the tension is sometimes unbearable. Then...comes the second part. We have the comic relief of the two paranormal investigators (one is the writer, Mr. Winell). Thankfully, their boss (Lynn Shaye) is dead serious. I LOVE that woman! A lot of ppl seem turned off by the explanation about the projection, but I thought it was very original and it took me by suprise. This movie is the first movie I have seen that deals with that stuff. And I'm interesting in OBE; even got a beginner's book on it. Well, after seeing this movie, I shall burn the book! LOL..j/k. I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 because the final scenes were cheesy with the Night of the Living Dead demons bursing into the house like they did. And that one last twist....lol...typical hollywood ""sequal?"" ending. And then there's Darth Maul...this time with hooves and a tail...and a snake like flicking tounge. He was VERY scary in this movie as the main demon, but couldn't the makers have been more original and not insult George Lucas like that? Granted, they did Maul justice by giving him a truly evil presence in this movie, but I would've prefered a completely original monster.

In conclusion, Insidious is a slow burning atmospheric horror flick suitable for teens and above. Plenty of jump scares, great tension throughout, excellent music, descent acting, and truly terrifying imagery. Just don't except the second half to live up to what the first half promises. This is no Paranormal Activity, which I gave 5 stars all the way!",1302566400,,2059,4.899713467048711
4408509,4,B004LWZW24,"A few folks have remarked on how unusual it is that the creators of SAW created a more old-fashioned spookfest with INSIDIOUS.  I guess they've forgotten (for good reason) the promising but ultimately very disappointing DEAD SILENCE, also from SAW writing/directing team Leigh Whannell & James Wan.  They clearly have an affinity for scares over gore.  (Much of SAW, the scenes with Cary Elwes in the ""dungeon"" were more psychological horror than gross-out...and are still the most effective moments of the entire series.)

INSIDIOUS is FAR superior to DEAD SILENCE, and frankly, it's far superior to many horror movies of recent years.  Whannell & Wan have been joined by Oren Peli (a producer), the guy behind the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY movies.  I don't know how much of a role Peli played in this film, but there are certainly moments in common.

As with the PA movies, INSIDIOUS uses lots of moments were something suddenly appears or jumps out at you.  We can feel something is coming...the camera, music, silence, etc. built the tension and then POW, it happens, and you give a little jump in your seat.  Many movies try for that.  But Peli and company somehow have the timing down better.  I'm not sure how they do it...but when they go for a jump from their audience, they usually get it.  This is a satisfying experience, and is the reason we tolerate bad acting, silly plots and crowded theaters.  We want the communal experience of getting scared.

INSIDIOUS tells the story of a family that moves into a new house and have weird things start to happen.  Worst of all, one of their sons falls into something like a coma and while nothing is medically wrong with the boy, he is no longer responsive to the world around him.  As weird things continue to happen, mom (Rose Byrne) begs dad (Patrick Wilson) to ""get out of this house.""  Normally, when this scene happens in a horror film (and it's an old clich&eacute; indeed), dad gets indignant and says ""no way"" and then things really go to hell.  Well here, dad says, ""okay, we're outta here.""  And they move.  Turns out, though, that whatever was bugging them in house #1 has tagged right along to house #2.  Not good.

They turn to ""professional help"" and I think I can be forgiven for expecting the help to arrive in the form of a short, eccentric southern lady, as in POLTERGEIST.  INSIDIOUS reminded me of that film in many ways...a solid family, a modern house (not some old mansion that ANYONE would expect to be haunted) and kids in peril and parents willing to do anything to help.

In the final third or so, the plot turns a bit silly and frankly, the scares pretty much dry up.  The ending is disappointing (as it so often is in horror films)...but overall, the film has built up enough goodwill to carry us through to the end.  The film has little gore, and is a nice, solid PG-13.  A scare us adults can enjoy with our older kids.  It plays itself deadly serious from beginning to end, and doesn't pander to the audience.  Yes, it is occasionally sillier than it needs to be...but it's constructed solidly, and is entertaining.

Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are okay actors and they are okay here.  Wilson, in particular, always strikes me as a bit bland (opposite Ellen Page in HARD CANDY and Kate Winslet in LITTLE CHILDREN, he practically disappears)...but he has a stolid earnestness that works for him here.  Byrne always has dark circles under her eyes and looks underfed, and this helps her (at  least physically) look the part of a worried-to-death mom.  Whannell, Wan & Peli are working with a small budget here...so presumably they couldn't get better actors.  I'll forgive them all that, because they also seem to be single-handedly keeping alive the good, honestly-earned scare.",1302480000,3,3761,4.716257668711656
4408510,2,B004LWZW24,"I seldom agree with critics when it comes to film revews (see my Black Swan review), but I am in total agreement on ""Insidious"". This film has a pretty strong and effectively creepy first act and sets the stage for even BIGGER scares later on. Unfortunately...that is where it fails. After about an hour, this potential scary classic delves into the realm of stupidity. It's as if the writer sat down and fell in love with the concept....and then let it get away from them. Like many of the reviews here, I completely agree the scares should be about what you DON'T see. The old Hitchcock device that worked so well for Spielburg in ""Jaws"", works well here..for about forty five minutes. Then it becomes ""Poltergeist""...but not a GOOD version.

The writer and director both wear their infulences on their sleeves and there are equal parts ""Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"" here. The sad thing is, this film does neither effectively enough to be an homage.

I won't give out any spoilers here...but I will say the ending clearly demonstrates that the writer just ""gave up"".",1302480000,5,1067,4.793478260869565
4408511,4,B004LWZW24,"Very atmospheric, old-school '70's-ish first half is very effective. Gets almost unbearably tense at a nice pace with scary noises and a great plucky, screechy (real!) violin soundtrack.

My younger friend is jaded, you know, so he didn't like the malevolent creeps - but I thought they were great. For this particular movie, I think it needs an audience, in the theater, with the sound turned up nice and high.

The booms, fwomps, swooshes and other ambient noises help carry this movie into Horror-Land (except for the home alarm. Be ready to cover your ears. It's only briefly annoying, though).

I thought the analogy to a roller coaster ride or a Haunted House ride was appropriate. It certainly has it's moments, I tell you.

The second half got into Ghostbusters territory a little bit but the main characters - Dad, Mom, Grandother, two sons, and a baby girl that's a bit of a cryer - took their roles seriously, played them straight, and really pulled you into the story.

When the ersatz Ghostbusters show up, there's a bit of corny explaining but soon it's back into Scares-ville. The denouement and wrap-up isn't jumpy as the first half, but it's still weird enough to keep your attention.

""Insidious"" is a crowd-pleaser - if you have crowd around you that loves to scream (and laugh afterwards, because the tension builds and builds and really gets to you so much that after a scare, it's hilarious).

I liked ""Insidious"" - a lot.",1302220800,68,1444,4.775100401606426
4408512,3,B004LWZW24,"I found that this movie was a little too familiar.  It seemed to steal bits and pieces from other horror movies - even way back to a brief scene in Rosemary's Baby (1968).

It started kinda slowly and I felt the wife wasn't worried or afraid enough of the weird things that were happening to be believeable - but that may have been a case of bad acting.

SPOILER ALERT: I also thought it was a little dumb that the husband didn't lock the deadbolt on the front door but DID set the intrusion alarm and engage the little door chain after someone (unseen) knocked on the door. Inevitably, the door was open again moments later and the alarm was going off.  I guess locking it properly wouldn't keep a ghost out anyway... Still, for me, when the characters are acting like real life people would act, I find a scary movie more relatable and more scary (the old Black Christmas is still my favourite, for that reason).  When they do stupid things that no one would ever do in real life, the movie becomes just gratuitous scare tactics with no psychological component.

I was pleased to see Barbara Hershey (The Entity) make an appearance here, since there were also similarities to her scary show (70's). I was wondering if she was chosen on purpose because of that.  I was half-waiting for a cameo by Bruce Willis(Sixth Sense) and JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist) since there were copycat shots from those movies, too. Someone younger is less likely to pick up on these similarities but I found them a little disappointing and distracting.

Overall, an okay movie.  I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out, just because I like freezing the frame at all the scary monster scenes.  This movie had some very scary-looking characters that flashed across the screen in a burst of loud music and I enjoy seeing their costume and make-up more closely.  I also like watching the ""making of"" footage that many DVDs include.

If I were to recommend this movie to someone, I'd say, ""It was good."" while shrugging.",1301702400,3,2002,4.624293785310734
4408513,3,B004LWZW24,"The first Saw film will always be something I fondly look back on. While the film had its fair share of bad acting and ridiculousness, that final twist just made everything worthwhile. Seeing it in theaters was something special, too. The snickering and the whispering amongst friends during the sillier parts of the film were silenced as Jigsaw revealed himself and the audience collectively picked their jaw up off the floor as a wave of silence washed over everyone. The downside is that director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell haven't really been able to capture that same sense of astonishment since. Death Sentence was a nice change of pace while Dead Silence left something to be desired, but both seemed to lack that key ingredient that kicked the feet out from under audiences like Saw did. Insidious looked to have potential even though most horror films about paranormal entities seem to fall flat on their face. While Insidious probably couldn't be considered the best film to be released this year, it's certainly still one worth seeing in theaters.

Insidious thrives on music cues and cheap scares. Fairly intricate orchestral pieces that are very string heavy are used periodically throughout the film while at other times noticing the lack of music usually leads one to expect something to jump out at them at any given moment. Nearly all of the scares are like that though with creepy ghosts and creatures jumping out at you when you least expect it. The opening felt like it took up half the film. We see an old woman holding a candle followed by the title screen with a string arrangement turned up to 25 even though the initial volume only goes to 10 and then we waltz through what feels like the longest opening credit intro in history. We're shown black and white stills while the cast and crew are listed up on screen. The film seems to keep this pace the first half of the film. It's incredibly slow moving; a creak in the floorboards here, a door moans as it opens by itself over there, and then the payoff is something silly like a ghost dancing to silly music. In addition to the first half being slow, it felt incredibly anticlimactic and was unintentionally funny most of the time. I found myself being more interested thinking about what the key Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) wore around her neck could possibly open rather than being absorbed in the events taking place on screen. Thankfully, the film picked up a bit in the second half.

One of the main drawing points of Insidious is that it's by the same people that made both Saw and Paranormal Activity. That's an interesting note as the first half of the film is very similar to Paranormal Activity if it was shot with conventional movie cameras instead of a home video camera. The second half seems heavily influenced by both Ghost Hunters and Poltergeist. The film's creativity lies within its introduction of ""The Further"" concept. Once we're shown that world and the evil entities seeking a vessel to come into ours, it feels like the film can finally begin; but it's bittersweet. It doesn't take long for the film to delve into familiar territory before closing on a predictable finale. The most devastating of the evil entities introduced in the film can best be described as the love child between Darth Maul and a faun. It was also kind of ironic hearing Patrick Wilson give that superhero speech since Wilson will probably be known best for his role as Nite Owl in Watchmen. Insidious does have a few intriguing surprises up its sleeve though. The main ones being when Specs (Leigh Whannell) is trying to get Dalton (Ty Simpkins) to follow his voice while Elise (Lin Shaye) wears that crazy looking gas mask and the other one being when we're thrown into the realm of The Further. The way that's filmed along with the bizarre events that unfold there will probably make that scene the one you remember the most after you leave the theater.

Despite the film's many flaws, it's still recommended that you see Insidious in theaters. Why, you may ask? Seeing a film like this in a packed theater is something special. That atmosphere is incredible. While the film may not make you jump, it's entertaining to watch and hear how it affects everyone else around you. The comments people make under their breath and hearing some of the guys scream like little girls is something that just won't be the same if you choose to wait to watch it in the comfort of your own living room. It's the type of film you take a date to even though you know they hate horror films because they're going to be grabbing all over you throughout the film. Also, I don't think I've laughed at anything this hard all year. So maybe Insidious is entertaining for all the wrong reasons, but at least it's still entertaining.

Insidious is an entertaining theatrical experience, but will probably lose most of its steam once it hits DVD and Blu-ray. The way it not only relies on jump out scares, but practically uses them as a crutch during moments of building tension will probably get old really fast to most viewers familiar with the horror genre. Throw in the extremely loud music and the film probably seems a bit more clich than it actually is. Not to mention it feels like it takes forever for the film to find its footing. While Insidious does offer a few moments of genuine originality, it doesn't take long for those moments to take that detour into predictability. James Wan and Leigh Whannell do have some talent buried down in there somewhere, but it feels like they've yet to find their stride as bona fide filmmakers. See Insidious with a group of friends or a mostly full theater. Otherwise skip it altogether.",1301616000,3,5695,4.697697697697698

4409089,5,B004LWZW24,GREAT FILM,1441238400,,10,4.5
4409090,4,B004LWZW24,"One day, Dalton falls off a ladder in his family's new, old home and falls into a coma soon after. His mother and father are naturally grief-stricken by their living, but static son. Uninvited guests soon arrive based upon this event, and begin appearing out of thin air.

I enjoyed the movie as a concept, though I got the feeling that some scenes were thrown in to fill up the film reel, as they undermine the horror. The first 1/3 of the film is subtle enough, with ghosts suddenly appearing in the children's rooms while the Mother, Renai is downstairs. One scene with a ghost standing in front of the infant's crib stands out (the ghost is reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein's reanimated corpse to me), but the use of a jump-scare to depict the Mother's horror feels like the movie is trying to say ""LOOK, SCARY!"". A creepy musical piece would do; the invasion of the infant's bedroom is self-explanatory.

I won't describe the second-half in too much detail in case you didn't watch the trailer, which has an integral plot twist. What I will say is that the second-half is where much of the cheesy ""so-bad-it's-goodness"" starts showing up, just to warn you in case you take your horror more seriously.

Elise, the movie's psychic medium, fits a World War 2 gas mask to her face. (The director of the film James Wan wanted to add his personal touch to a seance) I find it more funny than creepy. Of course, what haunting movie would be complete without some telekinesis, and all of sudden, Dalton's body is used by the film's main demon to ""use the force"" to push everyone back from table like a Sith Lord (Did James Wan watch Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, because it looks like Darth Maul got hired to be the demon of this universe). :D

The final stretch of the film is where the mood is creepy enough, what with the father Josh taking an astral trip into ""The Further"". This fear factor is due to the danger of losing track of where your body is, in this film's mythos. I enjoyed the concept, specifically the danger being lost in a void surrounded by ghosts who are hungry to live again.

However, when Josh gets to the red door, to enter the ""Lipstick Demon's"" (yes, that's his name) lair, he is temporarily overpowered by a ghost guarding the entrance. In the words of Jeremy @ Cinema Sins ""Really? that's all it took to fend off the demon? A little pep talk and a Street Fighter move?"" Even more ""scary"", the Demon is in his lair behind decorative steel bars, sharpening his Freddy Kruger claws to Tiny Tim's ""Tip Toe Through The Tulips""? Now that's just cheesy.

So I enjoyed the movie, but not necessarily for the intended reasons. Have this movie for a sleep-over or movie night, and you'll probably begin feeling creep-ed out, but the mood will probably be undermined by the cheesy antics later on.",1440547200,2,2822,4.556213017751479

4409182,5,B004LWZW24,"It's hard to really say I love it with five stars, it was...effective. I'm not sure I can say I really love something that scared me !@#$-less, so all I can say is that it was effective. I love the Gothic horror from the 50'a through 80's, Poltergeist, Tobe Hooper movies, The Ring, White Noise, The Others, etc., I am a true patronizer of the genre. It's hard to believe with horror re-defined today as just some slasher going around slicing and dicing in between nudity and stupid characters I hope all get killed, gratuitous language, that they could actually make a movie with a plot and believable characters that actually sticks to a story. I have had it with those stupid 'Twilight' movies, for example. The poster child movie to show exactly what has gone wrong with the vampire genre. It degenerated over the years from what it was decades ago, truly scary, until rock bottom with 'Twilight'.

  Insidious wasn't all CGI, very little in fact, for a few quick 'jump scares' and boy did I jump, almost out of my skin. This, and Insidious 2 may be the most scary movies I have ever seen. I went to sleep disturbed thinking I may have nightmares. Although, 'The Conjuring' may also be tied, and maybe still 'The Shining', 'Salem's Lot', 'The Exorcist 1', or 'Altered States'. At least, I was equally scared during all those movies. In their own way they are each the scariest.  This is what people must have felt like seeing 'The Exorcist' in 1973 or Poltergeist ten years later. I don't believe there has ever been a movie featuring the dangers of astral projection and its connection to dark forces like ghosts and demons. These concepts have been around for years but never featured in movies like this before. This is also becoming one of the best movie series of all time too, ranking now with the Hellraiser and Phantasm series for a string of movies that don't quit and build on each other like a miniseries. 'Halloween' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movies started out that way too, but not in the same league as these. Insidious 3 came out this summer and I'm almost afraid to see it, but I will, with some lights on and not alone.",1437004800,,2145,4.5636363636363635

I'm a tall guy (6f2), but by the end of the movie I wasn't visible from behind, because I literally craweld into my seat. My wife, who is quite small (5f1) was looking down on me at the end. The most funny thing is that I don't know why or what scared the pants off of me. There is no violence and no gore and there doesn't even happen much in the most terryfying scenes, but still they leave you breathless. When I watched the film on DVD it was nearly the same. I always looked around afraid of seeing one of the creatures from The Further. Some might think that  I'm a scaredy cat, but I'm not. I'm a genre fan since puberty (I'm 43 now) and seen the most violent and sary stuff that's out there.

4409275,4,B004LWZW24,"Horror movies can be very tedious to watch because of their numerous repeated clichs and predictable derivatives. I have a low tolerance for movies where I can predict whats going to happen. I feel that if I can tell whats going to happen next, whats the use of watching the movie? I even sometimes predict the ending, and to no dissatisfaction, I am correct. Big waste of my time, and Ill never get those hours back. Fortunately, Insidious did not fall into that category.
 I would say Im a pretty valiant person. I can watch many scary movies, but after they're over, I always recollect, think back on the best parts, and have forgotten about it in the next hour. I can honestly say that with Insidious, that wasn't the case. I started watching Insidious one night, and after the first ten minutes, I had to turn it off. In my defense, however, I really wanted to sleep that night, but if I had continued to watch more, that wouldnt have been possible.
 Insidious is not your typical run-of-the-mill horror. It does have that mystery and suspense that many horror movies have, but its predicted in a way you wouldnt suspect. Despite the budget for this movie, which totaled at about $800,000, Insidious accomplished its goal of being a successful horror. Insidious even won two fright meter awards, one of which being Best Horror Movie. Main characters for this movie included Patrick Wilson, Rose Byme, and Lin Shaye. Insidious spends no time delving into its purpose. From the introduction, I was grasped by the eerie music and the special effects of just the opening credits. Insidious was directed by James Wan. If youve ever seen Saw, or the Conjuring, the direction of this movie is easily figured. Now before this movie gets dismissed because of its genre, I will say that I enjoyed the fact that this movie is all mystery and suspense, intended for those who don't really like all the gore in past horror movies (such as Saw) directed by James. It didn't need all the blood and guts spilling all over the place to be scary. Its split-second spine tingling images do the trick. Insidious will have viewers jumping from one scene to the next, with no time to recover. Considering this movie was shot in only three weeks, Insidious has amazing cinematography. Despite the computer generated being, the special effects of the actual demonic images and creatures add to the already suspenseful atmosphere.
 I really enjoyed Insidious. It has a lot of great moments that grab hold, and don't let go until the conclusion of the movie. It does include references of past horror movies, but I feel that adds to the story rather than take away from it. Also, as a side disclaimer, Insidious can be hard to understand at some points in the movie, so you may need to watch it twice, but I guarantee youll catch something, or someone you didn't see before that will make you keep your eyes glued until the end, once again.
 James Wen did a remarkable job with Insidious. I recommend Insidious to all horror genre lovers, and even if that category is not ideal, I would say that if you watch Insidious, it will not disappoint, and might even make you rethink your movie preferences.",1429747200,3,3178,4.689964157706093

It's true spine-tingling psychological terror and doesnt depend on gore or violence. The characters are down-to-earth and the plot and dialogue are believable. Minus 1 star for two cheesy amateurish effects. I also watched first 30 min of ""Possession."" And ""Insidious"" is without a doubt far superior.",1410480000,,446,5.208333333333333

4409796,5,B004LWZW24,"A family moves into a new home, and spooky things start happening. Eventually they realize the truth -- they are being haunted by a malevolent supernatural force.

It's a plot so common that it has become a cliche, but there is still some creative juice to be squeezed from it -- and in ""Insidious,"" it scares the pants off you. James Wan (the guy who gave us the original ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"") crafts a slow, eerie drift through a ghostly nightmare, which is only flawed because sometimes it feels like he's throwing every single scary thing imaginable into it.

Renai and Josh Lambert (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson) have just moved into a lovely new house with their three children, and everything seems fine.... until their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a coma, and the doctors don't know why. Then weird things start happening -- Dalton's brother reveals that Dalton sleepwalks through the house every night, faces appear in the windows, and a mysterious specter attacks Renai.

So they do the sensible thing: move to a new house. But then Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) spots a horrifying figure lurking near Dalton's body, and they realize that whatever was haunting them before has followed them.

So Lorraine calls in an old psychic friend, Elise (Lin Shaye); Josh believes that she's just a fraud, but she soon shows that she can detect the Darth Maul-looking creature that is haunting Dalton. It turns out that Dalton's soul is lost in a spiritual in-between zone that Elise calls The Further -- and if they don't save him soon, something terrible will steal his body.

In a lot of ways, ""Insidious"" reminds me of ""Poltergeist"" -- a family, a new home, a terrifying ghostly presence that is stalking a gifted child, and a parent who is forced to go into an ""in between"" death dimension. And like ""Poltergeist,"" this movie takes well-worn ghost story cliches and makes them scary once more... just by doing them really well.

Even before the spooky stuff begins, director James Wan gives the movie an eerie atmosphere. Every scene is full of pale grey light, with lots of empty shadowy rooms and sudden bursts of loud wild sound (including ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips,"" which is terrifying enough). And he gives you the feeling that something is lurking in the corner just out of sight -- something cold and hungry, something utterly merciless. Even worse, it's not alone.

Gradually, Wan builds up a sense of building horror, throwing in glimpses of dead-faced men, gas masks, and finally a venture into the Further itself. This is basically everything that James Wan finds terrifying -- a hellish, eerie dimension filled with the grinning puppet-like dead, victrolas piping eerie music, and a demon who looks like a Darth Maul minotaur. It doesn't sound scary, but it will have you clawing the arms of your chair.

The only problem with the Further is... well, it feels like Wan flung every single scary thing he could come up with into the Further, without much of a plan. It's wildly effective on a visceral level, but it leaves you wondering how some parts of it (the laughing kid, for instance) gel together with Darth Maul Demon.

Sympathetic characters in horror movies are about as common as frogs who can do algebra, so it's refreshing that... well, pretty much everybody in this movie is likable. While Josh seems insensitive at times, it's gradually revealed that there's a reason why he shies away from all things supernatural, and Patrick Wilson really gives a powerful, intense performance as a guy desperate to save his son, yet resistant to what could save him.

Byrne is at the other end of the spectrum -- Renai is crumbling slowly under the constant onslaught of specters and scares, and Byrne captures her raw terror for her family. Shaye and Hershey give solid performances as well... and my only complaint is that the baby is ALWAYS crying.

With excellent direction and a very talented cast, ""Insidious"" is a haunting ghost story that builds up to visceral, nightmarish terror -- and while the horror seems random sometimes, it's still very effective.",1400284800,,4104,4.865329512893982

The ending was great because it leaves room for a sequel which has been made and I'd like to see.  It was pretty scary but I am not scared easily. Movies like Psycho scare me more where you just have an ordinary man going rip roaring crazy.  Ultimately for any fan of horror flicks or psychological thrillers I recommend this film.

Then the wheels fall of the bus as a medium shows up to explain everything away and set up the ludicrous 'rescue' which is filmed with so little lighting you'll be frequently wondering whether or not your TV display has gone on the blink.

Even if I didn't like the movie he is in, I always like him.  Not true for this movie.  He was swirling around the bowl of hollywood toilets along with many other garbage movies made in this genre.

The movie rips off Poltergiest first with startling similarities to Dead Silence, the Ring and several more not worth mentioning.  But if you've seen them, you know what I'm talking about here.

It was such a ripoff, I expected them to even have a ghost rape scene with Barbara Hershey as a nod to the Entity as well...

It was awful from beginning to end and it hurts me to say that about Patrick Wilson...but it's the truth",1382659200,,750,4.345323741007194
4410467,3,B004LWZW24,"A young family begin to experience supernatural occurrences and their young son, Dalton, who never recovered from a minor accident and is in a mysterious coma, appears to be the centre of this strange phenomenon. A medium is called in and it is discovered that Dalton, has the ability to astral project and travel to another realm, which is referred to as ""The Further"" and is somehow lost and may be in the company of a monstrous entity. His empty, soul-less body, has become an open vessel for other worldly creatures who are wanting to live again, and will possess his body if the sleeping boy's soul is not returned soon.

It has been stated that this film bears a resemblance to the classic Tobe Hooper film, ""Poltergeist"" (1982). Let's see.  Both films deal with supernatural activity tormenting a young family with the phenomenon concentrating on one of the children. Both films have a child lost in another dimension,  ""The Further"" (Insidious) or ""The Other Side"" (Poltergeist, although this term wasn't used until the sequel). Both children are in the company of a monstrous evil. Both films have a team of parapsychologists called in to try and establish contact and return the child to this world. Both films have a parent travel to another dimension to reclaim their child. The similarities appear endless. However, visually, the 2 movies look nothing alike. ""Poltergeist"", in my opinion, is superior. Hooper's classic is very Special Effect's heavy and has a lot more on screen action, with floating phantasms, supernatural whirlwinds, exploding coffins and many corpses on display, not to mention, it also had heart and a funny bone. ""Insidious"" really has none of the above, and this films tone is much more darker. Comparisons aside, ""Insidious"" has a lot of atmosphere and there are some real sinister scenes. You do see some surreal characters and images during the last quarter of the film and the performances are good. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the tormented couple, John and Renai Lambert, are good, although Josh, at times, was kind of loopy (more on this a bit later). I also loved seeing the beautiful Barbara Hershey again as Lorraine, Josh's tormented mother who also has a secret of her own to tell. The film is more psychological, relying more on atmosphere and tense situations for its chills, and some of the make-up effects are frightening (the main demon resembles Darth Maul a bit too much). The score is a bit creepy, although it could get a bit grating if you sit through the end credits, almost like nails on a chalk-board.

Some of the scenes are a bit of a let-down. **Possible Spoilers** When Josh is shown ghostly pictures from his childhood, the apparition in the photos are just too in-your-face to the point that they look photo-shopped. Images that were less obvious would have been far more successful. Also when ""The Further"" is finally visualized, it is much too dark to see anything clearly and the ghosts/souls inhabiting this realm are quirky and rather pathetic, aside from the main demon, they do not appear at all that frightening, and I have to admit, the main demon lost it's frightening edge once I realized it likes to listen to Tiny Tim. Josh also appears to be a bit mindless in the latter parts of the film and is not able to follow important instructions all too well. A medium explicitly tells him that he is travelling to another realm and to NOT DRAW ATTENTION to himself because if they (meaning the evil creatures that reside there) realize he is not one of them, they will come for his ""physical body in this world"" yet once there, he starts screaming at the top of his lungs ""Dalton!!!, Dalton!!!..Followed by ""Where is my son? .. Tell me where my son is, please! .. Have you seen my son!??"" and then initiates a fight with, none other than a parasitic and powerful entity and screams at it - `What do you want from me?..I am not scared of you ... Get away from me.. Leave me alone!!"" . Really? Dude, really? You fail.

""Insidious"" moves along surely but slowly and there really is minimal action here and when the action does start during the all too important climax, it is much too dark to see any of it. With that said, I do appreciate this film and would love to see more of this type of horror releases since for the past decade, we have been given far too many slasher movies and torture porn. ""Insidious"" is more in the lines of ""The Changeling"", ""The Exorcist"", and of course, ""Poltergeist"", the film it most resembles, at least in spirit. It's a good little horror tale but despite its chilling atmosphere and good performances, I still have to admit that this has been done before and done much better. It's still makes a great movie to watch on ""Halloween"" with the lights turned off and the volume set to MAX.

Like any sensible person who believes they've taken up residence in a haunted house, they move. Right! Wrong! So the ghosts pack their bags and move with them. Oh great more guests!

His astral projection and his spirit has left his body without really knowing it's gone. If he doesn't come back soon he'll be lost forever, taken by the strongest of the creepy phantoms, a blood-red fiend who provides the most terrifying moments.

4410559,2,B004LWZW24,"Overall, not as good as I had hoped for.  If you've seen ""Poltergeist"" and/or ""Paranormal Activity"" this movie has elements of both.
The story follows a family who has just moved into a new house and starts experiencing strange occurrences (a story line that has been used way too many times, imo).  Then one of their son's falls into a coma, for no apparent reason.  Bring in the psychic stage left.
Honestly, I would have stopped this movie after 15 minutes in, but I wanted to see where it was going.  Finally stopped it after an hour and 15 minutes.  I didn't care about the ending, and I really should have been on the end of my seat wanting to see the ending.
So, the story wasn't all that great, it lacked uniqueness and depth.  The characters were not that compelling either, and therefore the acting wasn't all that intense (and it should have been based on the scenario they were put into).  The directing, also, was a little ho-hum for a scary intense movie, like this should have been.  Establishing shots are really just boring, in my opinion.
I look to issues with the directing, and mostly, the writing. It needed to be a better story.

In the first few minuets of the movie, I thought it was going to be just one of those regular `ghosts in the attic' movies, but no, this movie completely surprised me. I'm not entirely familiar with the cast, but they did fairly well. However, the characters that stood out the most were not the little boy and his family, but the psychic and her hilarious ghost hunting team. With all the scary that's going on and the little boy frolicking away in his dreams; they shed a little light on the matter at hand and ultimately break the tension within the household with their funny antics. The boy is very creepy sometimes, but I can't tell if that's the regular nature of the character, or the fact that he's being haunted. The icing on the cake for me was the creepy music that mixed well with all the scenes. Every time that creepy tune came on, my whole entire body had tensed up knowing that something was going to happen.

The ghosts and demons that are in this movie are absolutely fantastic and will surely send chills down your spine once you see little glimpses of them and in some cases you will see a full fledged demon! Oh yeah, this isn't the Mothman. You will see some pretty awesome effects and a lot of darkness. The CGI is just amazing for this movie. There's a lot of strenuous tension in the film, especially with the boy's father who is constantly trying to retrieve his son from his nightmares. They realize that the boy, himself, is an astral projector which is rather interesting and I can relate. I thought I had several experiences with astral projection as well. Anyway, where was I going with this movie? Oh right, if you want to scare yourself, by all means watch it alone - with the lights off and doors and windows shut, but it's a lot of fun when you're with a bunch of people and they start screaming and jumping in every scene. It's not so scary if you do it like that and it's a lot of fun.

Not this movie!

From the very start of this movie, I new this one was different.  The blend of music and vague imagery in the starting credits really make you pay attention to the film and make you look closer at what you're seeing.  This movie does not rely on startling the watcher and only uses that tactic when needed.  This movie shows you something and after it passed you will think, ""did I just see what I thought I saw?"".  It is very creatively made and the atmosphere is menacing and thick.

I thought about this movie well after it was done.  It not only is a great horror movie, but also a good movie in general.  Good acting, great dialogue, perfect pacing.  The movie gets going early on and does not let up.  I was extremely impressed with this film and recommend it to everyone.

It seems to me that horror is one of the most difficult movies to produce as there seems to be so few quality titles.  I can name many action, drama, animated, comedy movies that I enjoy but horror not so much.  This is one of those rare gems that went under the radar.

4410867,1,B004LWZW24,"Hollyweird has done it again. What they term as ""The Further"" I belive as being hell. And the real
hell is much worse then they portray it to be in this film. I was also hoping for a Pastor or Priest
to exercise this ""demon"". After seeing an actual priest, for a whole two minutes, he then disapears
for the remainder of the film. What we get instead is some crazy old lady who claims to be a physique
who refers to hell as the further. (*or was it farther ~ whatever*)In any event, it's more of the same
old new age mumbo jumbo. You'd think that The Lord's name would be utilized here to help save this young boy
and his family. Instead, the name of Christ is only used for blasphemy. Typical. No Bibles, no prayers.
However, we do get a couple of bumbling 3rd rate ghost busters who appear quite useless. But then I
believe that would be the comedy relief of this silly film.
 Now I do realize that this film is only fictional. But when it comes to demonic possession, there should
be certain qualities that have some sense of reality based in fact. And I can tell you all that read this
review is that demons are too real. And Bill Murray will never solve your problem. If there was a
possitive note to all this, some of the quick scares were well imagined. And hey, having Tiny Tim do ""Tip Toe
Through The Tulips""?? It just doesn't get scarier than that.
 Anyway, I put this film on the high stinker level. And if any of you out there find yourself, or family member,
being possessed by a demon, grab a Bible and call a Godly man. And by all means, break those old Tiny Tim records!

The sound affects and music with the movie is great, and had me and my fiance on our seats.  Many people mock the demons in this, which makes me feel they don't have much of an imagination.  I'm not gonna give away the whole movie, but the movie is based on 2 main demons one who stalked the father when he was little and one who is now stalking his son.  We thought the music went along great with the demon stalking the child in the movie, it made the demon sicker in nature.  Others felt the first half of the movie didn't flow well into the second half, and I disagree.  the first half set the story up for the second half, and explains what is going on.

The back story was used to great effect to build up the suspense until the final moments. The use of the ""Tip-toe Through the Tulips"" theme music for the demon was perhaps the most twisted part and added a certain sickness that the movie was in need of.

Particularly effective, is the Director's (or creative staff generally) ability to mix the routine and ordinary with the supernatural. The less a film sticks on the one note, the more it is going to make the highspots really high. This is the customary mother and father with three children moving into a new house and, almost immediately finding trouble. I like the idea of not putting the action into the deserted cliched mansion  setting but, rather, into a solid middle class housing area and an ordinary nice middle class house.
How it will strike devotees of  the genre, I cannot say, but for those who only occasionally drop in on this type of movie (like myself), it should be effective.",1368662400,,770,4.696296296296296

The characters weren't cheesy and the acting was fairly good. Definitely thought the whole idea was different than your typical haunted house type movie, which we liked. We knew we would probably add this to our horror movie collection so we recommend it since it is very re-watchable. The sounds were very well done and the scary characters were very unique. The DVD quality was perfectly fine for this type of movie, blu ray was not necessary. The price was good, Amazon definitely had the best price and the free shipping over $25 is just a great option to have. We really liked the special features as well.

The big slogan was, it's not the house that's haunted, and it was compared to the exorcist, both couldn't be further from the truth. Without going into details, the story is just stupid. The special effects are laughable, and the acting is so-so. The kid, newcomer Ty Simpkins, was mildly entertaining and did do a nice job. The parents weren't too bad either, but the rest of the cast were just terrible, a perfect fit for a movie that is pure garbage. If it wasn't for a couple of scares and the fact that I was laughing at how stupid some of the parts were, this movie would have gotten zero stars.

4411282,4,B004LWZW24,"""Insidious"" starts off looking and feeling like a 70s vintage horror movie, in all the right ways.  Starting off reminiscent of ""Amityville Horror,"" but better, it shifts tone to be more like ""The Exorcist"" later; still, it remains its own movie.  Director James Wan isn't afraid to set the camera down and let it run - not to the extent of a David Lynch, but still, after years of shakycam it's a welcome relief.  Further, it enhances the tension, because the lack of motion or cutting in some scenes makes you wonder what, if anything, is going to move on the screen.

Toward the end of the second act, suddenly a team like the Lone Gunmen from X-Files, by way of Ghost Hunters, shows up.  While jarring at first, it's just off kilter enough to work and to be effective.  Tension and horror is built up effectively.  Then, the ending, however, knocks off an entire star; almost two.  I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say it left me simultaneously laughing, angry and scratching my head.  Please, filmmakers, stop it with the badly-thought-out ""twist"" just to have a twist.  (I'm looking at you, ""Battlestar Galactica,"" as well as this movie.)

It's not a spoiler to say that, at the end, an overly-dramatic title card for ""INSIDIOUS""! comes up with a way over the top music stinger, causing me to laugh far more than be horrified.

Still, despite its flaws, it's an effective and entertaining horror film, which proves that James Wan is more than a guy who got lucky with ""Saw.""  It's at least worth a rent.",1360713600,2,1512,4.597014925373134

Very good atmospheric horror movie that is for the most part top-notch in every respect.

4411571,4,B004LWZW24,"If you're looking for a movie that'll send its share of shivers down your spine, then you could do a lot worse than Insidious.  A Haunted House movie that delivers what you expect yet still does its durndest to avoid cliches sounds like more than one could dare to hope for.  And Insidious comes very very close to being that good.

The cast is very believable in their roles.  The chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne is there.  These feel like a well adjusted couple with a handful of kids.  You could see this group walking through the neighborhood grocery store and buy that they are a family.  The two ghostbuster characters bring in a bit of needed comic relief, but not so much as to derail the tone of the flick.  The character of Elise does a fine job of enhancing the spooky factor. Not because she's a creepy person, simply because the information she brings to the table raise the stakes dramatically and the actress does a fine job in not going over the top in what most movies probably would have made a showier role.

The movie is there to frighten you and it does a very good job with the creep out parts.  The director knows how to play an audience and he has a lot of fun trying to get you to pull that pillow you're gripping in even tighter.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that daytime was not treated like a safe haven.  The different ghosts and spirits were diverse and did well in playing with several different fears.

The first hour of this movie was building up to make me believe I was dealing with a modern classic in the horror genre.  Then the third act happened.  The thing is, that last half hour isn't necessarily bad.  In fact I appreciated its attempt to go in a bit of a different direction than a normal haunted house movie.  I simply felt that the execution didn't live up to its ambition.

For a fan of movies full of fright, I have no hesitation in saying it is a movie worthy of your time.  I just wished that the brilliance of the first hour was followed through with a more satisfying conclusion.",1346889600,2,2051,4.378306878306878

4411574,5,B004LWZW24,"I find it not a little ironic that one of the best PG-13 modern horror films should come from the producers of Saw, one of the goriest franchises in history.  Regardless, they've done a very good job, and hopefully other horror films will follow this example.
Gore is no longer scary to modern horror audiences.  Thanks to modern technology, we can see someone rip out another's still-pumping heart, and this has become boring to us.  Gore can be effective when used correctly, but such occurrences are few and far in-between.  The horror market has been flooded with rubbish like Hostel and Cabin Fever, films relying on gratuitous gore or torture scenes, for too long.  Audiences are longing for films capable of providing chills and racing hearts, not brief gross-out moments.  Thankfully, some horror producers are recognizing this.
Insidious is the classic haunted-house ghost story with a twist, which I won't spoil for prospective audiences.  I have few criticisms regarding the acting or plot; for the most part, this film does what it set out to do.  There are a few cheesy moments, of course, and I wish the film had been more subtle at times, but there weren't any major mistakes that ruined the film.  The atmosphere is consistent, the film spends time building up suspense and the mood, and there are enough comic-relief moments to let you fully realize how tense the story has become.
I'd recommend this to horror fans and newcomers to the genre, particularly young ones with little experience in horror.",1344556800,2,1518,4.921568627450981
4411575,3,B004LWZW24,"I love horror movies.  I had missed this when it was in theaters and decided to just buy it and watch it.

The plot follows a couple with three young children, who have just moved into a new home.  Within a day or so, the oldest son, Dalton, slips into a catatonic/coma-like state, though no reason can be found for it.  As other things begin to happen - the house alarm going off, the front door opening when it was closed and locked before, etc. - the family decides to move.  But, as the DVD cover tells you, it's not the HOUSE that is haunted.

As soon as they move into the new house, doors are opening and closing on their own and records switch without anyone nearby.  Clearly, the issues are not stopping, so a psychic is contacted to explain things.

The acting performances were pretty good, especially that of Rose Byrne.  She continues to be a very watchable star.  I'm not a huge fan of Patrick Wilson and I found his character quite annoying (last night, you thought someone had broken into your home, but it's okay to start working late every night now?  Nooo.) I also enjoyed Barbara Hershey in an understated performance as Patrick Wilson's mother.  The psychic, Lin Shaye, was fabulous.

Overall, the story didn't wow me that much.  It worked for me in that what your mind goes to is usually much scarier than what you're being show on screen - like the original Psycho.  Less blood and guts and a better storyline are always welcome, and this movie has those.  But scary?  Not really.  Especially when you know that the folks behind Paranormal Activity were behind this one as well.  It uses a very similar formula, especially at the end.

It's well done, but it won't knock your socks off.",1342828800,,1709,4.504885993485342

 Brought to you by James Wan (director) and James Whannell (writer) of the SAW film series (2004-10, 2017).

  The Lambert family have moved into a two-story house. The house has nice wood inside. Like all horror movies, their is something creepy in this house. It starts with making noise in the attic. Renai (Rose Byrne) can't find anything wrong in the attic, but it is eerie like a presence is there. Dalton (Ty Simpkins) goes up in the attic to play. Up on a ladder, he tries to reach the string to the light. The  presence is closer to him, but we can not see it. Suddenly, his parents downstairs in the living room hear him scream. He had quite a fall with a wound on his forehead. They put him to bed. The camera pans to the window.
  The next morning, Josh (Patrick Wilson) tries to wake Dalton up. He is still. He is not responding. They take him to the hospital. The doctor (Ruben Pla) tells them he is in a coma.
 At home, Renai is listening to the baby monitor. Strange sounds are in the baby room. It becomes the voice of a man. Suddenly, it yells ""I want it"". Renai jumps up and runs to the baby's bedroom. The baby is upset, but no one is in the room. Dalton is in his own bed still in the coma. Foster (Andrew Astor) hears the house making noise and he says someone walking in the hallway is bothering him. He wants to change rooms.

 Twenty-six minutes into this movie, I was getting the creeps and it reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity-2/dp/B003Q6D25K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity 2</a>&nbsp;(2010). I wanted to turn it off and go to bed, but I can't. I'm scared. Have to continue watching this.

 Renai can't stand it in the house anymore. She wants to movie to a new house. And so they do.
 The new house has more sunlight and appears to be cheerful. Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) is Josh's mother. She is there to help them move in and give comfort.  When Renai is alone, the creepy stuff happens again. Now she sees the haunted people again. Later, Lorraine admits to seeing the Indian guy in the corner of Dalton's room.
  They decide to bring in some paranormal help. Specs (Leigh Whannel) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) can find the ghosts. They also bring in Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) who has the most experience.

4411746,4,B004LWZW24,"I normally don't get scared from PG-13 movies (last one that did that was Signs) but Insidious had me freaked out at parts which was very refreshing. Although the longer the movie goes on the scares start to dwindle until the ending which I thought I could predict, but it was two steps ahead of me and provided a nice chilling twist.

So in the beginning one of the kids is comatose in a bedroom and the mom is starting to suspect there's a supernatural element in effect, while the dad is dismissing everything as ridiculous. Rose Byrne is excellent by the way, she was great in Bridesmaids and she's great in this, I hope to see her in more roles. Before the ghost specialists or whoever come into the picture the movie is at it's scariest, I don't remember feeling such a chill down my spine after hearing Tiny Tim in this movie (well before Darth Maul is listening to it).

The ghost specialists are called into the job, one sweet old psychic lady and her two assistants which look like two Mormon hipsters. They're kind of played for comic effect but the scares were still present and the story ups the ante a bit. After that though the dad goes in the 'ghost world', and lots of people didn't like this bit. I didn't mind it however, it was mysterious and the smiling family bit was pretty creepy, but when the dad got in a fist-fight with a ghost that was pretty damn stupid. The ending where the dad finds his son held captive by darth maul that was kind of a dumbed down chase scene as well.

The director and writers know how to maintain atmosphere and tension very well, which is kind of a rarity these days in horror. So while that was good the ending was dumbed down to a fist fight, I don't know if it was an argument with the producers about the final act or something but it just felt jarring after such a good 2/3rds that some really dumb decisions were made near the end. The VERY ending twist though was great.

Even though it's really not that great a movie it is a refreshingly old fashioned chiller of a horror movie, perfect for Halloween time.",1336176000,2,2068,4.363636363636363

4411751,4,B004LWZW24,"Insidious was insidious in the way it started off so slowly but after a while I was totally mesmerized by it. I was just watching it, not even intending to wait until the end, but it really got me hooked. The director, James Wan, is from Malaysia, and he is perhaps best known for his work on the Saw franchise. I haven't seen them, but imagine they would be much more violent than Insidious. Wouldn't expect the director to be so subtle in drawing you into the premise.

The story is about a boy and his family who move into an old house that seems to be haunted. He is exploring the attic when he falls off a ladder and into a coma. The doctors say he checks out fine, yet he is in a coma. The paranormal activity ratchets up, with the mother convinced the house is haunted, but the father skeptical at first. Reluctantly he agrees to move to another house, yet the strange occurrences don't let up. An old friend of the family, a woman named Elise Reiner, is called to help. She reveals that Dalton is a Traveler, adept at astral projection. His father is also talented in that way, but he has suppressed the memory. The boy, Dalton, is trapped in a strange dimension called Further where lost souls and demons roam, looking for vacant bodies to inhabit, such as Dalton's. If he doesn't get back soon, he could lose his body to one of the malevolent creatures intent on doing harm with it.

I don't want to spoil the story, because it works best if you don't know where it is going and let yourself slowly get pulled in. Patrick Wilson plays, Josh, the father. He was Nite Owl in Watchmen, and was also in Hard Candy with Ellen Page. His part wasn't written or directed so well, as he goes from skeptic to participant so quickly it seems sudden and forced.

Elise Reiner: Close your eyes, Josh. Take a deep breath and relax. With each breath, let the life around you fade into the background. Just listen to the ticking of the metronome. Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead. The universe is deathless. It is deathless because having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man, by not advancing himself, stays the further ahead of himself.

(That last part sounds like it came from the I Ching).

Patrick Wilson was adequate, and I've seen him do much better in the other roles I mentioned. Rose Byrne is the mother. She was in X-Men: First Class and Bridesmaids. She does most of the heavy lifting, acting-wise.

I think the director did a great job of building tension and drawing you in. It was very realistic and believable and when all the crazy stuff started happening, I got goose bumps fur realz. This kind of story, where one must go into the underworld and bring someone back, is one of the oldest stories around. Dante's Inferno, Orpheus, Ulysses, etc. I think that once it got going, it was almost a little too straightforward. Where was the twist?

But nevermind. I've said too much, and don't want to spoil anyone's suspense, or suspension of disbelief. The Bottom Line is that it had a lot of style, was subtle but certainly frightening enough once it got going. It avoided most of the cliches of films from this genre. Like, usually they stay in the haunted house even though it is obvious that's a terrible idea. Too bad moving doesn't solve the prob:

Elise Reiner: It's not the house that is haunted. It's your son.",1331510400,2,3353,4.467320261437909
4411752,5,B004LWZW24,"Wow. Holy crap is this movie scary. Did you like Poltergeist when it first came out? This one is vaguely similar in plot, but much better, dare I say. You've undoubtedly read the basic plot from other reviews, so I'll skip to how this movie makes you feel. While watching it, when it gets to a point where the music is building and you just KNOW something is going to jump out and scare you? Well, somehow this movie manages to still frighten you to death even though you know it's coming. And there are ones you don't see coming, too.
The 'villian' as it were, in the end (without giving any spoiler alerts) is the type of monstrosity that makes me of all people, the atheist, think I'd better get my ass to church REAL soon. It's one twist after another, with a strong cast, and every creepy type of ghost you can think of all rolled into one movie. (you'll never be able to listen to Tiny Tim again either without getting creeped out, I guarantee) And it's not bloody or gory. It'll just mess with your head and make you very afraid of the dark.
The cool thing that I read on IMDB about it was that the writer sat at his desk writing this movie with a bulletin board of horror movie cliches in front of him, making sure he didn't hit any of the overused horror movie moments. Somehow, it worked. Last year, I did a Halloween scary movie marathon and watched a different movie every night in October. If I would've watched this one first, I would not have watched the other 29.

4411754,4,B004LWZW24,"I saw the teaser poster for a movie called Insidious. The artwork reminded me of a Children of the Damned poster and had what appeared to be a possessed child standing in front of a house. The movie began and I learned about a young couple Patrick Wilson (Josh) and Rose Byrne (Renai) who had a young son  Ty Simpkons (Dalton) and a newborn baby.

A few over imposing spirits have apparently haunted the house. Ghostly children play records and skip throughout the house laughing. A very large man paces back and forth anxiously about the porch. Demonic figures stalk the nighttime world. The couple's newborn baby cries for no apparent reason... A devilish voice can be heard screaming behind the baby's cry from a baby monitor. As the attacks and haunting grow stronger, Renai pleads and then eventually begs for her husband Josh to move her and the family out and away from the cursed home. The family moves and quickly discovers that this house is apparently haunted as well and the little boy slips into a deep coma. Renai calls a team of Paranormal Research Experts to investigate the haunted happenings.

Two men enter the home and the ghost hunting does begin. As the two men are apparently humoring the victims by ""Ghost Busting"" the house with the equivalent of a ""Fuzz Buster"" the team soon realize that a more experienced teammate must be called. Elise, the teams channel-er, psychic and clairvoyant notes that there appears to be an insidious force who want to crawl inside the body of their young son. The father rejects the possibility of the fact that his house is not the thing that's haunted; it is his son. Further research of the boy's room and artwork drawn by the boy would then conglomerate this possibility very strongly and thus the team of paranormal experts along with the boy's parents will have to descend into a world of darkness from the dream world where the little boy has been trapped due to his uncanny ability to ""Astrally Travel"".

Insidious is a movie that reminds me of several movies all in one: Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, Wes Cravens New Nightmare and a slew of others. Insidious also has a few elements that remind me of the video game Fatal Frame. I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how spooky and chilling the movie actually was and found myself not only glued to my seat but also jumping from fright along the way. Quick ghastly images and disturbing concepts makes this movie my top-horror pick so far for 2011. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan or for anyone wanting a good old-fashioned scare.  No real gore or excessive killing here and that is what makes this a movie that will probably have you saying, ""They Just don't make movies like this anymore"". Insidious is not fun for the whole family and is rated PG-13 for a very good reason. Insidious is definitely the stuff that nightmares are made of.

4411755,4,B004LWZW24,"This movie is scary, but there is no blood shed although there is some blood.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  Insidious held my interest throughout even though I found myself scoffing.  I couldn't help but wonder if this movie had been done several times before.  The plot seemed to borrow the same formulas we saw in countless other thrillers like, ""What Lies Beneath"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""Paranormal Activity"".  A child goes into a coma, but we soon discover its not a coma and more that he's got the gifts of astral projection and just travelled away too far where evil lurks.  A family moves into a home only to move out into another home because the mother senses there is something evil in that house.  Only problem is that whatever the evil is has followed them to the new home.  I always wondered how easy it would be to simply pick and move again if one felt dread in a house you just bought.  Her husband who is a teacher and has never worked late a day in his life, but is suddenly working late every night and she notices.  So do we.  This serves no purpose except to get him out of the house long enough so she can experience the evil and he can come home and tell her she's crazy.  Then there is a ghostbuster medium (think back to Poltergeist).  She almost gives this couple the same speech as the Medium in Poltergeist did about the whereabouts of their child and who is with it and why.  Still, regardless of all the obvious cliche's I enjoyed watching this.  It was fun, creepy and the cast does a well enough job that it feels believable and almost too real.  This makes for a fun scary night, but don't expect Shakespeare.",1326758400,3,1663,4.38562091503268
4411806,4,B004LWZW24,"Somewhere along the line horror movies went from atmospheric, spooky tales to blood & guts fests in order to get you scared.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bit of blood in my horror movies, but I love just good old fashioned creepy stories that don't rely on excessive carnage & violence to get you creeped out.

I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie and my husband and I both came away thinking it was pretty darned good.

The premise is a young couple who move into a large home with their infant and two young sons.  Things start to happen in the house and the family decides the house has got to be haunted, as their are strange sounds, and it seems there are others in the house when there isn't anyone there.  One of the sons begins to draw strange and demonic pictures and he writes that he seems himself sleeping and then flies away.  The makings of a unique imagination or something else????  The mother is so unnerved but the unexplained things that she is experiencing that she is more than happy to ditch the grand house for a much smaller one to start fresh.  Early on the one son, who has been making the strange drawings is exploring and finds his way to the attic and the creaky old ladder snaps a rung and Dalton falls and hits his head.  Things seem ok until the next day when his father cannot wake him and they go to the hospital.  The doctors cannot explain it, he is not in a coma, but he is not in a wakeful state either, he is in limbo and they don't know when/if he will come out of it.  He returns home with a hospital-type setup and is fed through a tube and they wait..... Meanwhile strange things begin to happen in the new house, enough that they begin to think that this house too is haunted....doors that were locked open, a record played changes to a tune that is not on the album being played, people start to see figures and hobby horses rock on their own.

The movie is spooky and then when you find that the son is actually the haunted one, it is strangely compelling-A psychic and her crew of two come to check out the house and see what they may be able to do to help rid the home and the couple's son of their demons.

I enjoyed the spooky chills, the creepy cinematography and the plotline.

Overall, a good movie if you like a good old fashioned scare.",1326585600,3,2302,4.237986270022883

I love movies like THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS, POLTERGEIST, THE CHANGELING, THE RING (and RINGU), THE GRUDGE (as well as JU-ON), THE ORPHANAGE, etc., and INSIDIOUS fits right in w/ these classics. It starts out slowly, w/ subtle things, growing into an all-out spook extravaganza! I watched INSIDIOUS three times this week, and I could easily watch it again! Wan gets horror in general, and ghost stories in particular. He was raised on the aforementioned movies, and boy does it show! INSIDIOUS has brilliant homage moments that never stray into copy-cat, parody, or cheeeze territory. Check it out!...",1325980800,,813,5.2615384615384615

4411809,4,B004LWZW24,"The director of the first Saw, James Wan, teamed up with the producers from Paranormal Activity to create Insidious. They prove that, in capable hands, a horror film doesn't have to be gory or use lame special effects to garner some scares.

Although some have scoffed at the film's premise, stating ""been there, done that"", I think that Insidious takes some measures to separate itself from the typical ghostly, supernatural tale. It's a film that might not appeal to the horror/slasher crowd that must see copious amounts of gore--decapitations, body parts flying around, victims being hacked, extended periods of human torture, etc. While Insidious isn't exactly subtle either, the film definitely builds its frights and spookiness from the terrors of being possessed and the unknown entities that exist.  There are those moments when Dalton lay in bed motionless while unearthly things begin to happen. There's also a sense of dread as the spirits (or some may say, demons) come closer and closer to the Lambert family. In one sense, it is the ""there isn't something quite right with this house"" tale with some disturbing things happening in the family home, but, as we see later in the film, it explores another, scarier realm outside of the haunted house theme.

Not to say there weren't issues. The film gets a little over the top and silly at points as in the film's final segments. There's quite an emphasis for Wan to let us know exactly when we should feel scared, with the creepy music provided as a cue, almost a little too much.

Problems aside, though, Insidious is an effective, well-developed, creepy film that uses atmosphere and building tension to give viewers genuine scares. A definite fresh take on the spooky house and ghost genre.",1325721600,4,1755,4.959183673469388

4411811,4,B004LWZW24,"You've got to hand it to director James Wan: he not only knows what scares you, he can also present it absolutely beautifully. Best known for SAW, the granddaddy of the so-called ""torture porn"" subgenre, in INSIDIOUS he presents an absolute minimum of gore to show that the best sense of film-going dread can come not from what the screen shows you but what it resists showing you: there are gorgeous tableaux of the successive homes of the main characters, Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne), where you stare concertedly at the quiet complex interior compositions trying to figure out if something is hidden within looking back at you. (And sometimes there is.) The film involves the Lamberts' eldest son, Dalton, lapsing into an unexplained coma after which mysterious spectral visitations come to the Lamberts' enormous home; after they move to a smaller house to escape the ghosts, the hauntings mysteriously continue, requiring them to turn to Josh's mother (the always welcome, if here underused, Barbara Hershey) for further aid.

The film is so excitingly paced and has such heartstopping compositions (such as the pre-credits sequence of a camera moving through a hallway, concluding its movement when it stops to rest on a spectral face staring back) that it seems to have everything it needed to join the ghost movie pantheon with such classics as A TALE OF TWO SISTERS and the original version of THE HAUNTING. What it misses is subtext: we never have enough sense of the Lamberts as a family to understand their larger emotional problems... or, for that matter, how they can afford an enormous multi-story baronial house filled with what look to be priceless antiques. (It's certainly not on Josh's salary as a schoolteacher; but if it's on Renai's income as a composer, why is this never explained? And why would a family with three small children have so many fragile antiques so precariously displayed?) The screenplay just isn't up to the level of the superlative direction and cinematography.

This is a film that is grounded in earlier films such as Ghostbusters, Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity but still has originality in terms of treatment and scares. A family moves in to a old house and needless to say that all hell starts breaking loose, at the beginning it is very discreet but the horror soon engulfs the entire family. This is the film that makes for very tense edge of the seat  because the sequences are edgy and the scares bloodcurdling owing to the novel use of sound and background music. Finally a movie that relies on direction, ambiance and music, witness the song ` Walking through the Tulips' by Tiny Tim and the piano theme by  Ludovico Einaudi  - Nuvole Bianche,rather than CGI to deliver entertainment. I recommend this film to be watched, if possible on Blu-Ray, with the sound cranked  up high and in the company of people, who will scream when afraid.

4411998,3,B004LWZW24,"Surprisingly 'old-school' ghost story given that the writer and director are best known for their work on the hardcore Saw films. If it weren't for the last twenty minutes and the subsequent, exhausted 'twist' ending, this would be a really solid film.

Young Dalton Lambert goes into a medically inexplicable coma. His family searches for answers. Weird things happen. A psychic is consulted. More weird things happen. That's the movie with the major twists and revelations unrevealed.

Wan and Whannel get a lot of productive mileage out of showing little and suggesting a lot, of quick scares and odd things lurking in the outskirts of the frame. The cosmology introduced by the psychic to explain what's going on makes a certain amount of sense, though it's not developed enough to be all that convincing for long. A visual homage to Neil Gaiman's Sandman series is a bit jarring; that one supernatural entity looks an awful lot like Darth Maul undercuts a certain amount of tension.

Rose Byrne is a stand-out as the worried mother. Byrne's face in repose tends to look sad anyway -- I think it's her eyebrows -- and the look suits the material. Patrick Wilson is fine as the father, who has supernatural secrets of his own, though he appears to lose about 50 IQ points in the last twenty minutes. When the psychic tells you not to draw attention to yourself, don't run around yelling at every supernatural entity you encounter, that's all I've got to say.

The movie also joins the horror sub-sub-sub-genre of 'Monsters who love novelty songs,' as one entity really likes Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips,"" which was already terrifying enough on its own. Hell's playlist must be really awful.",1321833600,3,1703,4.882352941176471

And then one of the sons lapses into a mysterious coma.

But I was pleasantly surprised when I found that Insidious is a really classic haunted house movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has some great scares! Especially considering that most horror movies nowadays (the Paranormal Activity sequels, not the first) are mostly about surprising us rather than scaring us, it's good to have a movie with genuine suspense and good payoff. I actually jumped several times! The third act is a little silly, but the ending is worth it. Overall Insidious is a very well made and creative haunted house movie that has some great scares and a fun story. Remember that guys? Fun?

4412070,4,B004LWZW24,"The films title means ""A deceitful enemy"" or ""Intend to entrap"" which speaks very well to the whole film!

Plot: The film follows a happy family that has just moved into a new home but immediately after, their son ""Dalton"" falls off a ladder and is presumed to be in a coma. Three months later Dalton (still in a state of unconsciousness) has returned as a Sick-in-bed kid who doesn't respond to anything or anyone. Soon after Dalton's return the family starts to have strange disturbances throughout the house that soon turn into a nightmare forcing them to leave the house. Apparently, the disturbances have followed them into there new house and they soon seek help from three professionals named Tucker, Specs, and Elise Rainier who soon find out that it's not the house that's haunted but rather the unconscious Dalton.  It is disturbingly learned that a demon is trying to posses his body while his sole is trapped in another plane of existence.  His father Josh Lambert learns he is the only one who can save him for he has had the same exact thing happen to him as well.

Review: This film is amazingly creepy and even though it stole from other films stories like poltergeist and the exorcist it still was put together quite nicely. Not many films that I've seen have shown what a demons layer looks like nor have I had so many ghosts and evil beings scare me as much as this movie was able to provoke. This movie is superb, thrilling, and frightening and with a 1.5 million dollar budget it still managed to scare me and probably a lot of other people more than films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho or Steven Spielberg's Jaws.

Acting: Some of the acting did seem a bit overdone but the rest was intense and real. The best acting however goes to the demons/ghosts themselves... they sure know how to put on a inappropriate, sinister, and vulgar show while still maintaining a PG-13 Rating!

Gore: nothing worth mentioning.... But this film did not need gore what so ever!

The Bottom Line: A creepy little film that I believe is going to have a large cult... probably not as big as the Blair Witch Project's or Trick r' Treat's but it will always rank up there as one of the creepiest and most devious movie's I've ever seen!

Warning: this film is Rated: ""PG-13"" for thematic material, violence, terror and frightening images, and brief strong language

4412071,3,B004LWZW24,"I had heard good things about Insidious which led me to this purchase.  Atmospherically, the movie is eerie which is fantastic.  It's that feeling you get when you are all alone in your house and the house keeps making weird noises and you get sort of paranoid.  Basically, the movie is about a family with three kids that are living in a house which they believe is haunted.  Things just escalate and one of the little boys goes into an unexplainable coma.  They move, thinking the house carried the evil, but actually they carry it with them when they go.  As time goes on, and the little boy stays comatose, the family invites a couple of goofy investigators in and a hardcore psychic.  It seems the little boy is able to astrally project himself during sleep so his soul separates from his body.  At some point, the two did not connect again and his soul is out there somewhere floating around while his body is pretty much empty.  The empty body is a breeding ground for evil things that are looking to take it over, namely a red-faced demon that likes to terrorize.  The astral projection also has a link to the boys father and it becomes a quest to save the little kid's soul.  My honest opinion is that this was a new idea, which is always good in horror.  Something different to be seen rather than the same old song and dance.  However, it got so out of control and ridiculous that it fell apart.  At first the demons slam doors and mess with a baby monitor and you see glimpses of them like behind a drape for instance.  But then it just turned silly and the demon was like a small boy who ran around and the story just lost its atmosphere so quickly.  Once you see like a solid figure and hear these obviously clear voices, it just takes on that Hollywood appearance again and the subtleties that made it creepy start to suffer.  Also, the outlandish investigators and the psychic with this gas mask looking thing did not help the movie at all.  Please, one of the guys had this contraption that looked like a scope at a proctologists office and he was inserting Viewmaster cartridges into it. Dumb. The first half is so promising - it was really creepy to me when the little boy Dalton was being taken care of at home and you could here that monitor beeping in the dark - I kept expecting him to half raise out of bed and look up with black eyes or something.  I felt really sorry for little Logan who obviously saw the things creeping around the house at night.  I was kind of hoping the demon was going to take that cranky little girl who kept crying every seven seconds.  She was giving me a headache.  Anyway, I just wish they could have redone this film and stuck with their original ideal of using old school atmosphere to scare the Bejesus out of people.  Once you are lost on this movie, you are lost and it becomes boring.  You could rent it if you are curious, but I certainly would not spend my money on it any further than that.",1317427200,2,2953,4.356489945155393
4412072,5,B004LWZW24,"Now here's a hard one to review without giving too much away, because this is just full of twists and turns.  I originally walked into this one knowing next to nothing other than that it was a haunted house story done as a collaboration between the makers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;and the makers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>, which was more than enough to pique my interest, and I had consciously avoided seeing any previews other than the original teaser.  Having seen the full trailer a bit later on, I think they actually give a little too much away, despite its leaving lots still unhinted at, and despite the fact that apparantly some people first thought the trailer was actually too vague.  So I could just say I don't want to spoil it, it's awesome, it's scary, get it; but I assume people want more than that out of a write-up.

So here goes: upon moving into a new house, a normal, likable family of two parents and two young sons begin to experience strange and sometimes frightening events in their new home.  Familiar territory, but still highly effective if done right, as it is here.  And as the accidents and apparitions begin to increase, they do something I've never seen a family do in a haunted house movie: they move out BEFORE things reach a critical mass.  The reasons used in other movies to justify the family's staying even when everything is starying to go to hell in a handbasket - they've sank every last cent into the new house, a simple reluctance to accept the supernatural, the borderline-'possessive' nature of the haunting gets into the minds of one or more of the family members and makes them strongly and irrationally attached to the house in a way they don't even recognize - these can and have all come off good when done well (and sometimes come off badly instead, true), but it was very refreshing to see that simple and obvious step taken to defuse their supernatural problem (even though not all members of the family are convinced it's supernatural at that point).

So they leave.  Unfortunately, it turns out that doesn't make anything better - the hauntings and the incidens come right with them, and continue to intensify.  Leading up to the pronouncement seen in the trailer, ""It's not the house that's haunted, it's the....""  With one of the family's children in deep trouble for a while now, the family turns in desperation to a psychic and her assistants for advice, not at all prepared for what they're going to hear.

I'm not going to get into too many more specifics, but it brings in more new and freakish elements as it goes along.  Some of the coolest and most shocking implications are buried in the subtext and in the viewers's own interpretations.  One particular possibility just floored me, and opened up the door to other potentials.  The visual imagery, the jarring use of innocent music against twisted macabre settings and happenings that makes the music and the smallest sounds seem so sinister, and the impressive use of eerily realistic special effects (even more impressive when you consider the movie's $1.5 million budget in an era when it seems to cost a mint to film a canned soup commercial) are all noteworthy.  So is the fact that the movie gets even better - and arguably scarier - on subsequent views, when you realize what's going on in all the seemingly mundane scenes, and the unique meanings of seemingly familiar incidents early in the show.

This is a winner all the way, and an absolute must for all horror fans.  Awesome and scary; get it.",1317254400,,3772,5.085899513776337

4412074,2,B004LWZW24,"Yes, it has a few effective scary moments, but the movie doesn't hold up (at all) because it doesn't know what it wants to be: psycho-horror film, fantasy, comedy or paranormal film. The result is a silly, sorry mishmash of a movie that repeatedly contradicts itself and can't live up to what it leads its viewers to expect. One character claims, ""It's not the house, it's your son that is haunted."" And yet the plot goes back to the same house to depict ""the further""---a supposedly other, ""astral"" realm ""beyond space and time"" that just happens to be grounded in the wood and mortar confines of the main characters' previous home. ""Don't call attention to yourself,"" an astral traveller is cautioned before entering that realm, and yet he enters it, carrying nothing less than a glowing lantern, and calls out repeatedly to loudly question each of the sad mannequin/mimes that themselves are supposed to represent the body-less entities that have been visiting a ""comatose"" boy. The dramatic seriousness of the first half comes to a halt with the entry of the comic duo that are supposed to represent the techno ghost busters who explain their tests are ""to weed out the crazies."" But why would there be any need to determine if the problems in the house are just due to madness when we later learn there is a history to the events in the film? And when there are no less than three people who witnessed the supernatural events? And how can one of the geeks instantly illustrate what a psychic describes without being psychic himself? Questions abound leading to the real mystery posed by the film: Did ANYONE bother to read this horribly disconnected script before it went into production?! Two amateur filmmakers would probably have done a better job.

I am quite pleased I had the opportunity to see this because, to be honest, it scared the hell out of me.  This is the kind of movie that tricks you into thinking it is a rote horror-fest, then treats you to surprise after surprise, building suspenseful moment upon suspenseful moment to its ultimate climax.  It is a movie of the supernatural, but it is more in the spirit of atmospheric movies like Rosemary's Baby than Poltergeist.  It's not that you think this is something that  might happen to you, but the atmosphere is so haunting that if you are anything like me, you will be turning on all the lights and peering around each corner after watching this film.

This movie literally drips with dreadful atmosphere, and the director was able to do on film what i have said for so long and that is this....scary things are much scarier in broad daylight.  The director successfully transformed the most familiar and comfortable atmosphere (the family's home) into a terrifying and righteously menacing space.  James Wan is single handedly saving the genre.  Not since Carpenter's The Fog have i been so buried in spooky atmosphere.  Much like another review i read, i literally felt uncomfortable in my home for a full day after viewing this film, and i consider myself a hard core and hardened fan of horror.  This film is outstanding.  I give four out of five stars only because of the slower pace of the second half of the film.  Thank you for reading.",1314144000,3,1055,4.690217391304348

4412175,5,B004LWZW24,"Years ago, young Josh (Patrick Wilson) suffered from night terrors; intense dreams that left the young boy terrified and screaming.  Now, years have passed and Josh has his own family.  Josh, along with his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and their three children have moved into a new home.  Everything is fine for a while until the oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) suffers a fall in the attic.  After the fall, Dalton slips into a coma.  The trouble is that the doctors cannot explain why he is in the coma.

After Dalton's fall, Renai begins seeing strange apparitions and hearing noises.  Josh, while somewhat skeptical, believes his wife and, thinking that somehow the house is haunted, the family moves a new home.  Although settled in their new home, the mysterious apparitions and noises didn't disappear with the move.  Soon, Josh, Renai, and the children are running out of options.  With seemingly nowhere else to turn, Renai enlists the help of a trained psychic (Lin Shaye) to determine the problem.  Upon her investigation, she determines that Dalton has the ability of astral projection, and his spirit has been corrupted by evil and he's now imprisoned in a dimension known as ""The Further"".  Only Josh, himself also able to astral project, can save his son from the demons who wish to possess him.  Will he succeed before its too late?

This is an excellent movie.  There's no blood and gore here, only truly terrifying psychological terror.  The story line is well-conceived, and the acting is very good.  I watched the movie twice, and I jumped each time I saw it.  Be sure to watch very closely, because there are some hidden clues throughout the course of the film.

When the son falls into what they think is a coma, they move out of the house into a new one only to find out that it wasn't the house that was haunted.

I won't spoil the rest of it, but it is a very smartly done horror film that relies on traditional values of classic horror instead of false scares like things running off the screen to fast to see. It has in my opinion the creepiest score since the original Psycho, and some of the most down right disturbing images to grace my mind in a long time.

4412300,3,B004LWZW24,"I personally like to believe that the expanses of human creativity and ideas are without bound or limit. I feel that this can be seen in many areas of our lives save that of movies (horror in particular, if you need an example take a pick of any of the numerous horror movie remakes that have come out over the past ten years). I wouldn't want anyone to think that by starting with this statement that im giving a bad review, cause im not.

This movie had some REAL and GENUINE SCARES that im telling you made my blood run cold for a few seconds, which kind of makes it worth watching. However, if you consider yourself to be a true horror movie buff (not sure exactly sure what a buff is but nonetheless) you're going to be very disappointed with this movie. Not sure how many of you have seen Poltergeist from the 80's. But all this is, is a remake giving us a bit of insight as to what Carol Ann probably saw on the other side when she was sucked into the T.V. (sorry for the spoiler).

The producers of this movie rely on the belief that today's younger horror viewers probably haven't seen an age old movie like Poltergeist (which by today's horror standards is pretty mild); thus it will probably seem like a fresh idea and concept to them, a cheap Knock off to those of us, who have seen it.

I mean  there were a couple of times while watching Insidious I actually said ""OH COME ON THIS IS THE EXACT SAME THING AS WHAT THEY DID IN POLTERGIEST"".

Still for those people who haven't seen Poltergeist, id say check it out. The scares are quality and the ending leaves you wanting more.

4412301,5,B004LWZW24,"As most readers by now realize I love horror movies. The problem is that over the past few years there have been so few that I've enjoyed. It seems like these days almost all horror films are remakes or sequels. If they are original they turn out to be more along the lines of horror porn than horror film. Then on occasion you find someone who loves horror movies as well and makes them for that audience. Director James Wan is one of those directors.

Wan's career took off with the first SAW film. While many might think this was the first in the horror porn genre (so named because films in that category dwell more on gory realistic effects than anything else like a story) it actually had more story to it than many movies being released at the time. He then made DEAD SILENCE, a creepy film that featured a ventriloquist dummy in the most terrifying manner. And now Wan has turned lose INSIDIOUS.

The film opens with a family moving into a new house. Mom Renai (Rose Byrne) writes music in her spare time while juggling taking care of three kids. Father Josh (Patrick Wilson) is a teacher. Both are trying to turn this new home into something special. Instead they find something terrifying.

Shortly after moving in their oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is lured to the attic by a mysterious force and then falls from a ladder. The next morning Dalton is in a comatose state and the doctors are clueless as to why. Three months later there is no change in Dalton but there is in the house. Something evil lurks there, creeping along in the shadows and seen only by Renai. The visitations increase until she convinces Josh that they need to move, which they do.

At their new house things seem brighter and more modern. But the visitations continue, increasing in strength and length. It is at this time that Josh' mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) suggests that a friend of hers come over. Elise (Lin Shaye) is a psychic of sorts who sends her crew in first to check the place out and see if it's legit or not. Sort of a bumbling duo that seems like a spoof of the numerous ghost hunting shows these days, the two find evidence and call Elise in.

After a quick examination of the house, Elise confirms that they do indeed have a problem. But she also points out that it isn't the house or the previous house that are haunted. It's their son, Dalton. Now before someone accuses me of dropping a spoiler on them know that this was seen in the film's trailer.

What happens next, the visions that are seen and the attempt to rescue Dalton make for a visually frightening film. Add to it a twist that most won't see coming (I didn't) and you have a story on hand that should offer a few nightmares to some and a reason to check the windows at night to others.

Wan occasionally uses the old bag of tricks with jump scenes where something pops up out of nowhere. Once in a while the music suddenly blares to let the audience know to pop up out of their seats. But he doesn't rely solely on these tricks to make us scared. He leads us along with an actual story that draws us in, makes us care and eventually has us rooting for this family. Telling a story that scares us, using visuals and not just jump scenes takes an accomplished director and I see that in Wan.

The acting turned in here is great. It wasn't until after I sat for a while when the movie was over that I realized we had so little background info on some of these characters. But it didn't matter. They were all played so well that they became believable and you worry more about them than whether or not the actor is doing a good job.

Visually this movie is as clean as you can get. Starting with shots in an older home with an attic to a newer more suburban home, both offer some scary shots and scenes that will stick with you. Most horror films shot at night or in the dark tend to go overboard and you can't see what you're supposed to be looking at. Not so with this film, one that hides what needs hidden and yet lets you feel like you're there.

As I said, I love horror films. I actually can't recall the last time one made me lose sleep though and this one probably won't do that as well. But it did give me a few scares. And it is one I'll gladly watch again. I never once found myself looking at the clock wondering when it would end.

I usually don't watch new horror films anymore, but I heard this was good and I'm a sucker for this kind of movie but I really think I'm done.  Even paying $.50 at the library was too much for this banana.  The plot is so by the numbers it's ridiculous, and as is typical nowadays you can't see half of anything because it's so dark.

4412341,3,B004LWZW24,"The first two acts of Insidious were nail-biting, tention-filled and truly spooky. Even the opening title sequence was creepy. Everything was spot on. The acting was great, the mood was perfectly set, you even had the creepy-looking child actor. The music was subtle and really set the tone, the newly moved-into house was filled with paranormal potentional. And it was even moreso magnified when we find out it really has nothing to do with the house!

Quick recap: A family moves into a huge, obviously creepy(but not overly so) house and then something strange happens to one of their sons, Dalton. He ends up falling and hitting his head but the next morning, he never wakes up. Doctors can't explain why he won't wake up from the coma and nothing seems to work. The family moves on, eventually caring for the son at home. That's when the actual weird stuff starts happening. The mom, played by Rose Byrne starts seeing things, hearing noises. Naturally she thinks the house is haunted though her husband, played by Patrick Wilson needs a bit of convincing. Things keep progressing to the point where she pleads to leave the house. He agrees and they move. Of course things don't die down because it has nothing at all to do with the house they are living in.

This is where the movie slowly starts heading downhill. They of course bring a paranormal specialist in on things and she explains what is happening to them, and their son. She seems to know an awful lot about these things and before we know it, a s&eacute;ance in the kitchen comes along, things are revealed, more odd stuff happens and finally, we get to the thrilling, super scary climax. Well, actually it really isn't all that frightening. I suppose if you scare easily, then maybe I can see this film as being an issue. Again, that's the problem with the final act. The fear-factor is all but gone. The mystery surrounding the film had been solved and there's not much left but to throw in a million different type of ghosts and beings and gloomy smoke and makeup. The actual ending is pretty neat, but some people may see it coming.

I truly wanted to love this film and hoped it wasn't going to become a clich&eacute; like just about every other horror movie out there today. But things were revealed way too early and all the excitement and intrigue was gone. That is one reason why The Others is still one of my favorite thrillers ever. Not one drop of blood in that entire movie, but utterly spooky from beginning to end. I guess its true that the best ghost stories are where you never even see the ghosts.

However when we actually saw the demon it looked like Darth Maul's retarded cousin.

The ghosts were creepy as hell and the ghost world was portrayed beautifully and it creeped the hell outta me and had me constantly on my toes!  The old lady ghost was creepy too, she gave me nightmares for days!

Leigh Whannel's script and James Wan's meticulously paced direction are efficient in creating a very spooky film.  As for the ""cheap"" demon effects, are our nightmares carefully orchestrated with top notch CGI?  Mine certainly aren't.  The crudeness and lack of real definition serve to accentuate the horror of an unknown world.
Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne give realistic performances in an unreal scenario.  Perhaps the parapsychic techs stretch credibility, but don't they act just like the techs on TV's paranormal ""reality"" shows?  But character actress Lin Shaye takes acting honors as the assured psychic who believes in her abilities and doesn't act like some new age guru,  This unflinching self-confidence elevates a typically clich character to a more convincing status.

Luckily, before viewing this movie, all I heard from a few friends about ""Insidious"" was that it was entertaining and creepy. I wasn't told it was great or extremely frightening or awesome. Sometimes feedback about a movie can leave us expecting something brilliant. This film was fun but not great. It is not original; you've seen most of this before in other scary films... but it was entertaining, especially the first part (before the seance people entered the picture).

Watching this film unfold gives you the thrilling feeling that you have no idea what might happen next, or what you might see next. It gives the audience an unsettling vibe that is a vital ingredient that many horror films are sorely lacking. The first half of the movie has a deliberately slow and sinister pace and tone. It works very well. You are off guard, unsure of what to look at or what's going on.

But once the pace quickens, once they start showing more than hinting at, it changes the whole mood of the thing, and that's what leaves me disappointed. Once in a while a horror film comes along with tons of potential in its start, but then things don't quite live up to the build-up. I'm reminded of another horror movie, ""Jeepers Creepers"" (2001), which  begins with such promise but then rapidly sinks into typical and predictable horror territory.

""Insidious"" strikes me as a fairly effective spookshow, warts and all (some of the demons are cheesy, some of the comic relief fails). It's above average compared to most modern horror cinema offerings, but it could have succeeded even moreso for me had it maintained its initial ominous and unpredictable flavor.

If someone does not think this movie is scary then they must love violence and blood.  There is a difference in being scary/creative/creepy opposed to just being bloody and stupid.

I'm just going to jump into it and that compared to other horror movies for the past decade, this one is one of the best right behind The Ring, The Grudge, The Other's, The Strangers and Paranormal Activity.
What could have been a 5 star movie earned 4 due to the first half an hour.  It was slow.  The filmmakers tried to set up the characters, showing the mom play the piano and the dad at work and stuff but and nothing scary happens.  We understand later that it's the boy's comma that sets off the chain of scary moments and that's fine, but they could have cut all this 'normal everyday living' and got right to the comma within the first 5 minutes.

Also, I found that the filmmakers should have placed the scares in the movie in different order.  We start off by having one big scare, followed by little scares like the door creaking open and a rocking horse rocking by itself, when they should have put the little scares first, built tension then put the big scares at the end.

But the last hour, wow.  It's a good thing I didn't turn it off because the story made me keep on watching.  People are complaing about the last 20 minutes, but the movie cost just a million dollars to make.  That's really cheap for a movie nowadays so what more do you want?  With the budget they had to make this movie, it was good, overall.  If only they would have trimmed some of the fat in the beginning, it would have been perfect.",1311811200,3,1443,4.307407407407408

It's as if it's a completely different movie, the style, tone, cheap look of the final sets, the overall look seems different, like they had a new cinematographer and director -it just doesn't flow well. And late in the film, Patrick Wilson's character all but uses a bullhorn to announce his presence when being quiet is of the utmost importance. Rose Bryne is the one that needed to shout in this scene, not Wilson. I did really like Lin Shaye in this. It's nice to see her in something other than a Farrelly Bros. movie. Not that she isn't great in those. There are obvious bits of other movies here, Poltergeist, 1408 but this film could have stood on its' own had it not lost it all in the climatic scenes at the end.

I watched this movie with a group of friends.  We are all fans of horror and suspense movies.  Sometimes our tastes cause us to argue, but while watching this we were all in agreement: this is pretty creepy.  At least that was what we thought until the explanation was given.  It was all downhill from there.  Not only does the explanation for the horror sound stupid, but the execution is laughable.  Had the film makers stuck to the premise of a haunted boy, it would've been a must-see movie.  Unfortunately, they took a risk that didn't pay off.  After seeing the main haunter (I won't use what it actually is as not to spoil the movie), we all just groaned before laughing at the absurdity of the villain.  If you think that a cross between Darth Maul, Freddy Krueger, and horrible CGI sounds scary, then maybe this is for you.  The special effects went from scary to something on par with a Sci Fi channel original film.

If you want a movie that will build up your expectations and then completely let you down - this is a good choice.  However, if you are looking for something scary (or just plain good), stay away from Insidious!",1311552000,2,1160,4.492822966507177

Starts off well enough, using the ole' less is more formula of haunted houses, but that's the essence of fright - letting the audience scare itself by leaving out concrete details such as the true appearance of ghosts/demons. Paranormal Activity used the less is more formula to great effect. Amazing how scared you can get on a budget flick.

Anyway, Insid builds it up but lets it down in the end, where the film just implodes, turns on itself and removes any sense of fright created so clearly in the start and middle.

Everything in INSIDIOUS is allegorical, each idea representing the aging parent whose aging children eventually grow up and enter a world (The Further) of which the parents are not part, but that the parents have experienced but have forgotten. Moreover, in this world exist terrors that may consume the children, changing them into something recognizable only in body while the spirit transforms into something awful--killer, paedophile, even a lonesome elderly person (an elderly mother or father who would leech the life from their children whose youth and success they resent)who seeks to draw the life from those that she latches to. Each ghost in INSIDIOUS represents a specific worldly terror. I'll not spoil the film by drawing comparison for them all, but think carefully about the parricidal ghost. What is the wish of many adolescents? And what parent does not fear being ""killed"" and forgotten by one's children?

4412642,3,B004LWZW24,"To sum up my reaction after watching this film in one word would be ""eh.""  Insidious carries on its title ""Scariest movie since the Exorcist.""  Keeping in mind that the critic(if one would call them that) came from Access Hollywood i wasn't completely sold.  Having seen my fair share of horror movies I can rank Insidious in the cliche ridden pile of shocker horror films that Hollywood has been churning out every year.
No new ground is uncovered in Insidious.  It takes the haunted house motif of horror movies from the 70's like The Amiyitville Horror, adds a a dash of the Exorcist with a peppering of of Poltergeist and voila you have just made Insidious.
The beginning starts out convincing enough with a bright young family buying a new house and hopes of starting a future.  The father played by Patrick Wilson is a teacher.  A teacher of what we never find out, but in the initial first scenes we learn that his past is somewhat mysterious.  Rose Byrne who plays the mother in the film seems to enjoy playing the piano while looking after her three kids.  Besides the look of sadness that pervades her every move, she spends most of the film either in tears or imploring her husband of the impending doom that is running rampant in the house.
Cliches riddle the tingling plot from the husband who doesn't believe the house is haunted to the crazy grandmother who hires exorcists to get rid of the demon lodged in her grandson.
High expectations may have ruined the film for me.  Looking for something fresh and exciting in the horror genre i was left disappointed and only mildly chilled.  Half way through the director seemed to inject a bit of humor into the film with the appearance of the three exorcist experts.  A chance to lighten the mood just turned into a desperate attempt of high camp comedy.
All in all Insidious is middle of the pack horror at its best.  It's high ambitions were trumped by cliche and tired acting from the people involved.  Insidious makes for a good rental on a Saturday night with nothing else to do!",1310860800,,2044,4.597796143250688

4412645,1,B004LWZW24,"So, the previews, prior to the film coming out, made it appear to be a nice, creepy, perhaps subtle haunted house story. Something with a ton of suspense...maybe not the most original plot and some really great actors. If only they'd decided to go ahead and make THAT movie...

This was awful. Just awful. However, it started out really well. As per usual, we get the seemingly normal, attractive, happy family just going about their daily lives when...suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, bad things happen. Suspense starts to build when they begin hearing strange sounds, seeing strange things...it's all very creepy and simple at this point in the movie. Very effective.

Then we enter the second half. When things REALLY started going downhill. The explanation for what was going on was interesting enough, not very original, maybe a bit silly but, interesting nonetheless. The first time I saw the ""demon"", I was shocked. Really shocked. Mostly because of how idiotic it looked. Then I started thinking wow, they actually put THAT in a movie. I brushed it off and said to myself that it had been great so far...maybe we won't see it again. But we do...time and time again. Along with other ridiculous looking creatures and people or...whatever you want to call them. The entire thing was just absurd.

In the second half, I felt like I'd started watching a different movie. The entire tone changed, the pacing changed, the look and feel of the movie changed. It turned into completely cheesy trash. The sets were horrible, the costumes, the makeup, the effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. The guys who did Saw (only the first 2 Saw movies are watchable) and Dead Silence (terrible, terrible movie) have NO idea what ""creepy"" or ""scary"" looks like. Not to mention I feel like they keep copying themselves. The ""twist"" they always stick in there right at the end...ridiculous! It makes me mad at just how ridiculous...I just sat there shaking my head when I wasn't laughing. Someone obviously took a trip to a costume store and stocked up on as much discount makeup, bad masks and bad wigs as they could find. Cheap, cheap, cheap! It all just felt so lazy.

Overall, what we have is something that could have been a really great movie but it was directed and designed by guys who have really bad taste and absolutely NO clue as to what ""scary"" is. A complete and total disappointment. I can't help but feel like James Wan is somewhere counting his money and laughing at everyone that wasted our time watching this mess.

It's interesting to read the comments here on amazon and the opinions / beliefs on what they call astral projection. It's one of those things that you really cannot disagree with someone on, and nobody can tell whether someone else did or didn't experience what they say they did.

Start off with the typical horror movie plot... family moves into a new home, problems arise, and the family is now scared out of their minds. Voices on the baby monitor, books pushed off shelves, doors opening, etc. Then a child falls into a coma, not medically a coma according to the doctors, but he won't wake up.

I like watching horror movies for entertainment value and normally do not care much about storyline or flow, but that is where Insidious totally screws up - its presented in a way you are expected to take it seriously. It tries to walk the same lines as ""The Exorcist"" or ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" which relates directly to possession but Insidious has it's own twist  with the idea of astro-travelers.

Insidious begins on the right foot building up tense and scary moments as the family moves into a new house and 'odd' things start to happen. It really does do things right in terms of instilling that creepy feeling into the viewers early on. The first half of the movie you are constantly wondering why happened to their son and what is all this strange stuff that is happening.

THEN, it totally nose-dives into a rushed explanation, ridiculous, almost laughable turn when they move into the second house. As soon as the psychic lady strapped on the gas mask to `cross to the other side' I quickly realized this movie was a total joke. I was waiting for the rest of Slipknot to come out and start playing `Wait and Bleed' (only metal fans will get this joke). I will cut the writers some slack on moronic `astro traveler / out of body experience' stuff but the way this `astro traveler' garbage plays out was just absurd and I found myself laughing more than once during these parts. Astro travelers can jump in and out of `the further/other side,' battle the bad guys in fist-a-cuffs, save cute little kids from Darth Maul looking `fire demons,' then wonder aimlessly in the dark with a kids Coleman lantern looking pathetic, but just have to `follow the voice' to go ahead and jump back to the real world. Perhaps it would have been better if the writers included ruby red slippers that you click together and just say `there is no place like home' to transport back. At this point in the film I was expecting anything absurd, so this would have fit right in.

The first part is as frightening as anything I've seen since the Exorcist. It's that creepy. The second half turns, for some reason, into part ""Suspiria"", part Amusement Park spook ride. This abrupt change of direction doesn't kill the thrill or detract from of the overall pace of the film but, it does downgrade it from a ""perfect 10"" to solid 8. Maybe 9.

Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who collaborated on both Saw (2004) & Dead Silence (2007), struck horror gold on this one. It's the kind of horror film that's best viewed alone and at night with the lights out if you can brave it. (As most of the great ones are)

Not at all a blood bath and without the stereotypical scantily clad teens in distress, this PG13, 103 min creep-fest takes the viewer on a ride that will leave you turning your lights on to get safely to bed.

The first half is a totally original haunted house spine tingling journey in and of itself and than you are catapulted into a dream like state of horrific illusion and visual Menagerie.

Drawling from ""Poltergeist"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Changeling"", Insidious is destined to achieve it's deserved position in the top horror films of history.",1310601600,3,1324,4.5974576271186445

I went into this movie with sky high expectations. I know it isn't fair, but I kept hearing from people that the movie was terrifying. People couldn't sleep after, people were getting sick to their stomach, and others were saying it was the best movie to come out in years.

The movie started off pretty decently, some of the acting was a little off, but I was willing to overlook it for the ghost aspect. The movie quickly goes downhill sadly. One ghost dances around looking like a Leprechaun, and it was hilarious. The ""demon"" looks like Darth Maul on crack, and the other spirits just are not scary. On top of this it was very predictable when and where the ghosts would show up. To have a good ghost movie you can't do that.

Once the movie is explained to really mainly be about astral projection, demons and other dimensions I got really bummed out. But I was hoping the movie could be saved. Sadly it couldn't. It got a LOT worse from there on out. The movie was just completely silly, especially when the old lady puts on a gas mask to communicate with the child...

4412889,1,B004LWZW24,"The Exorcist, The Entity, and Poltergeist are all very important movies.  In fact, nothing proves that statement more than the dozens upon dozens of films that have aped their premises.  There's a person or a family and they're being followed by something that they can't shake, so they call an expert in the paranormal for help.  As Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell proved, it isn't impossible to create a movie using that formula and have it deliver on its promises.  Drag Me to Hell had a great cast, a clever script, and taut direction.  Insidious has only one of these things.  With a cast made up of Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy), Rose Byrne (Damages) and Barbara Hershey (loooots of stuff), I'll let you decide which of the two this movie is lacking.

To start with, the script is bad.  I mean, really bad.  As someone who has acted in things with horrible dialogue and even written some things with horrible dialogue, I'm still surprised when I hear such wooden nonsense come out of the mouths of actual actors who have proven themselves with great performances.  They try, though.  Rose Byrne sits on her porch waiting for her husband to come home and when he arrives, one of those thoughtless ""why are you coming home so late all of the sudden?"" moments rears its ugly head.  The problem is, the movie is absolutely loaded with this tripe.  Of course, at one point in the film, the husband has seen something that can in no way be misconstrued, and he throws the exorcist, uh, sorry, the astral projection lady out of his house for being fraudulent.  Every single thing this movie does has been done somewhere else and has been done much better.

That isn't to say that there aren't any good ideas in the script.  For starters, astral projection is rarely in movies, so it's interesting to see it show up in a horror film, but the concept is wasted on a simple retread of the final act of Poltergeist, except it's less visually impressive.  This leads me to my next point; the direction.  A movie like this needs tense, gripping direction.  Instead, we get something that lacks focus. Director James Wan is not good at those things. Oftentimes, it's brutally obvious that the actors aren't even speaking to one another.  The pace often drags its heels and for too long, the movie goes through the motions of showing us the characters not doing much of anything.  That would be okay if those scenes had a point, but they don't.  They're just uninteresting.  This film definitely could have used some more liveliness all around.  Scenes that should be frightening come across as plain silly.  Oooh, there's a person walking back and forth outside.  Oooh, the door opened itself.

Finally, when the time actually comes for something that should be visually interesting to occur, Wan shows us a house with a little bit of fog and some darkness.  That's great, the unfathomable dimension is a foggy version of the families old house.  That's not scary or clever, it's just lazy.  That's a great word to sum up this movie; lazy.  Now, before I ramble on any further, I'd like to talk about the sound design, which is so overbearing and ridiculous, all it did was make me chuckle uncomfortably.  When the audience is supposed to be scared of something, we generally see no sign of it on screen, but the score ratchets up in intensity and starts making silly Halloween noises before finally cutting off BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENS.  Oh, my, Rose Byrne used a hockey stick to look at what is obviously a pair of shoes.  Oh my god, it WAS a pair of shoes!  Naturally, the score has to reach a crescendo when that happens, and a comical crescendo at that.  It does redundant crap like that through the whole movie, too.  We get it, it's a horror movie, now stop trying to scare people with shaky violins and false scares.

I didn't mean to ramble, but this movie really is insanely lazy.  If you scare really easily, chances are you might like this.  If you like your movies sensical and intelligent, however, you'll probably be bored to tears by this tedious, derivative film.  I love Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, but they should seriously try signing on to less idiotic movies from now on.",1310515200,15,4181,4.634013605442177

Scared out of my mind and intrigued at the same time. I consider myself kind of a horror/sci-fi connoisseur, and in my opinion, this is an instant classic that will be a favorite for the rest of my life.

The music. If the music doesn't creep you out, you may not be alive at all. Screeching and wailing violins...all placed in just the right parts of the film. Not since Goldsmith's 'Alien' score has there been such a perfect horror soundtrack. And even the 'Tiny Tim' song strangely works just right.

The old lady in the window and the other 'spirits'. The old lady in the window is absolute nightmare fuel. That is the kind of ghost that kept me up at night as a child. There are a variety of menacing characters about as well. At least one of them is sure to get to you.

The story. The story is very creative and original. The story does explain just about everything that happens...which I found very refreshing. The actors played their roles well, and the film has a good flow to it. The film feels very polished and not hurried at all.

""Horror 101: The Exclusive Seminar"" features director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell talking about how they first came up with the notion of astral projection, which they hadn't seen much in film and place it in a haunted house setting. Whannell wanted to make sure that the audience got to know and identify with the Lambert family so that they would care about what happens to them later on. He and Wan come across as intelligent and eloquent with a good knowledge of the horror genre and its conventions.

""On Set with Insidious"" takes a look at the making of the film with plenty of on set footage as we see Wan working with the cast and crew. We see how one of the film's stunts is performed and an alternate take of a scene. This extra provides some nice insights into filming.

4412945,3,B004LWZW24,"I agree with most critics and audiences that INSIDIOUS had some genuinely nerve-wracking moments. The tension and dread are very nicely wound up as the movie progresses, and the supernatural aspects are very ""realistic"" in that they are subtle and in shadow--like things you could actually imagine happening.  The sequence involving the house alarm going off at night is perfectly pitched and will have you stressed and on edge. There are several legitimate ""gotcha"" moments that rattle your nerves. The acting is top-notch (esp. Rose Byrne, who plays the mother). Even the ""haunting"" relies upon an interesting concept related to astral projection. So, why 3 stars?  Well, that's because the last 1/3 of the film is absolutely dreadful. In fact, it is so bad that it feels as though a low-grade director co-opted from the SyFy channel took over directing for Guillermo DelToro in the last act. I honestly felt I was watching a really bad horror film from the 80s complete with lame special effects, haunted house-like phantasms and a demon being that looked like it came out of Labyrinth. I was expecting Freddy Krueger to pop in and make a cameo as Patrick Wilson's character wanders through fog-drenched dark rooms. In fact, the entire last sequence feels alot like what happened in Poltergeist when Jo Beth Williams' character goes into the ""otherside"" to rescue her daugher...except Tobe Hooper (who directed Poltergeist) had the wisdom to let the audience imagine what that place looked like. In INSIDIOUS, we are taken right into the ghostly dimension -- and it looks like a low grade neighborhood haunted house.  I think the reason I was so frustrated by this movie is because the first and second acts were brilliant and genuinely scary (I would say more scary than almost anything on screen in the last decade). Naturally, then, the crappy last act felt even more disappointing juxtaposed against the fantastic first and second acts.  I would still recommend it for the scares that are generated during the first hour.",1310342400,3,2028,5.008902077151335

4413093,4,B004LWZW24,"Insidious (James Wan, 2011)

The last time director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell got together, we got the criminally-underrated 2007 fright flick Dead Silence. It's a fantastic little movie, scary in all the right places, and pretty much no one saw it. The reason for that is the film they collaborated on before that--Saw. Well, okay, not Saw itself, but the series of increasingly-unwatchable sequels that came after it. Wan had nothing to do with them save throwing money at whoever was working on them at the time (Whannell wrote the next couple before dropping out, at which point he adopted Wan's ""we'll make money off it"" stance and became another executive producer). Wan and Whannell's names will forever be linked with the Saw franchise, despite neither one of them having had a firsthand effect on a Saw movie since Saw III, when Melton and Dunstan (The Collector) took over Whannell's writing duties, and the series abandoned any pretense of being other than the gory soap opera it is. Given all that, it's sometimes hard to remember that the traps and the gore in the original film were nothing more than accents concealing a perfectly-scripted, perfectly-paced mystery. For all that Saw took the roughie genre and dragged it into the mainstream, essentially inventing ""torture porn"", go back and rewatch the first movie--it isn't torture porn at all. Then came Dead Silence, which about half the time I'm convinced no one but me has ever seen. (Rectify that at your earliest convenience.) And so we come to Insidious, the third collaboration between the two. It is much more Dead Silence than it is Saw, and because of that, I'm quite surprised at the enthusiastic reception it got on the festival circuit. The reaction from the critics has been more predictable; many hated it. (As I write this, its Rotten Tomatoes rating is 60%; it's teetering on the ""fresh"" threshold.) I think it's possible a number of them missed something, and it's something very important to one's enjoyment of the film, in my regard: James Wan has jumped on the retro-horror bandwagon that came into being as (I have often suspected) a reaction to Hollywood's current, relentless remaking of old horror films under Michael Bay and Roy Lee's aegides. The thinking seems to be, ""if people are going to go see old horror films, why don't we make new horror films that seem like old horror films?"". The trend brought us two of the best films of 2009 in any genre, not just horror: Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell and Ti West's The House of the Devil. Insidious runs straight through those same veins, and of all the critics I've read on this issue, only AP's Christy Lemire has gotten it half-right, and she's the best anyone's done so far. More on that in a few.

Plot: the Lambert family have just moved into a new house. We have dad, Josh (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), a schoolteacher; mom, Renai (28 Weeks Later...'s Rose Byrne), who's taking time off from corporate life (we never do find out what she does there) in order to focus on a nascent musical career we are to infer she gave up to get married and have kids; two sons, Foster (The Hangover's Andrew Astor) and Dalton (Little Children's Ty Simpkins, and I'm amazed this kid hasn't found superstar status yet), and the new baby. The first night, while everyone's just kind of hanging around, Dalton wanders up into the attic, which we already know is creepy because Renai was up there previous. He slips and falls, banging his head. Seems okay, but the next morning, he doesn't wake up. Hospital stay, etc., no one can figure out what's wrong with him. Until, that is, Josh's mom Lorraine (the always-welcome Barbara Hershey, recently of Black Swan) hooks Josh up with Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye, known primarily as a comedic actress, but her horror pedigree is a mile long and stretches right back to the original A Nightmare on Elm Street). It is Elise who delivers the movie's tagline, which I think was supposed to be a spoiler, but ended up in every trailer ever released for the film: ""it's not the house that's haunted. It's your son.""

Lemire mentioned in her review (and in dialogue on Ebert Presents At the Movies with mubi.com's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who loathed it) that it's ""basically a remake of Poltergeist"". As I said before, she's half-right. It's very much informed by Poltergeist, with Shaye taking Zelda Rubinstein's role, but that wasn't Whannell's only source material here. The movie is equally informed by Sidney J. Furie's 1980 frightfest The Entity, and if you want to get where Wan and Whannell, especially the latter, are at with this movie, that's the critical component. The Entity was one of the best, and arguably one of the scariest, horror films of the eighties, and it basically got ignored because it was doing supernatural horror during the golden age of the slasher film. (Also, telling: who starred in The Entity? If you said ""Barbara Hershey"", you get the gold star. Including her in <em>Insidious</em> was, I strongly suspect, not a random casting decision.) The Entity has not been nearly as influential as it should have been because of that, and so it's not as easily detected as Poltergeist as an influence. But watch The Entity and then watch Insidious and tell me you can't see where some of those shots came from. The best retro horror is retro horror that captures the feel of the seventies and early eighties while being rooted in the present day; The House of the Devil was a pure-D throwback to seventies satanic panic pictures with the cynical cultural awareness/self-obliviousness of the modern teenager subbing in the lead role. Insidious went the same way, except it's the modern family instead of the modern teenager.

One of the other things we forgot as the Saw franchise degenerated was how subtle a screenwriter Leigh Whannell can be. That's something that didn't really resurface in Dead Silence, and thus I'm ashamed to say I forgot it as well. But check out the way, for example, Patrick Wilson's character is set up. Wilson is at his best when, as in Hard Candy, he's playing a sleazeball. And that's exactly the setup we get. We're expecting a sleazeball. You know exactly where Whannell is going with the elisions and the outright lies. What makes it all the more intelligent is that Renai knows it, too, but is also smart enough, and has been married to Josh long enough, to see through it. That's multi-layered storytelling for you right there, and it's well-done indeed. Now here's the thing: that sort of subtlety is, for obvious reasons, more easily detected in the first half of the film, which is basically all setup. (Even Vishnevetsky said, however reluctantly, that the first half of the movie was better.) But it doesn't just go away when we get to all the supernatural-action stuff. Everyone and their mother has been blasting the ending of this movie, and now that I'm thinking about it, I'm wondering if the problem wasn't Whannell's subtlety, but audience expectations that that subtlety had gone away. Which makes no sense; think about the Big Reveal scene in Saw, where it all came together and we finally got Jigsaw's identity (it's still one of my favorite Big Reveal scenes ever), and it was blessedly obvious (thanks to the overbearing montage that immediately followed it) how subtle all that setup had been. Wan and Whannell got rid of the montage here, thankfully, though they couldn't resist one flashback scene that wasn't necessary. Are you telling me you didn't see it all in retrospect, or that you didn't think it worked? Because it was absolutely there. Whether it worked or not is personal preference, of course. I thought it worked very well. (I also wonder how much influence producer Oren Peli had over the ending, which is a little too close to the ending of Paranormal Activity 2 to be a coincidence.) More to the point, would you have preferred the other, more obvious, ending? 'cause to me that would have felt like a major cop-out. (Oh, one other retro touch--the frenzied eating of spaghetti. Where have we seen that before?)

In short--I liked this movie. I think I probably liked it a lot better than you did, but I also think that if you watch it another time or two, knowing the ending, you may pick up on a lot more of the reasons I liked it as much as I did. Hey, it's worth a shot. As far as the movies I compared it to above, it's not in the same league as The Entity, but it's on the same level, quality-wise, as Dead Silence and Poltergeist. If you haven't seen it yet, be aware this isn't your basic fright flick; you'll want to pay slightly closer attention than you otherwise might. *** 1/2",1307664000,4,8669,4.7574750830564785
4413094,5,B004LWZW24,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

What I liked about this particular horror film is the extremely scary images that pop up. Not only do they pop up but they stay up so you can get a good hard look at them!
It also plays on real fears like the monster under your bed (ok not realistic but it has plagued children for ages) and having some stranger outside your house (the baby room scene with the guy standing out the window scared the s**t out of me as did the bedroom scene with the guy pacing outside the window.)

The main monster was kind of a mash up of Darth maul and Freddy Kreuger but was still very scary. He had his little ""surprises""

The movie is extremely scary without using any blood which is what I like (except for one scene where each of the family in the furthur has a single gunshot in them.) I didn't want to see a gorefest (if I did I'd just put in an 80's teen slasher)

It is just a very, very weak plot. The story at the beginning is really scary but then the writer just does not know which directions he wanted to take the audience with this flick. It's a pity that the talents of such great actors like Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson has not been fully utilized. There are so many chances to make this horror movie really terrifying.

If you miss this movie at the cinemas, I would humbly suggest that you rent this movie first. If you like it then it's alright. If you do not like it then it is okay too. I just personally think this film could be so much better because I love these filmmakers(James Wan & Leigh Whannell) earlier works like the first ""Saw"" movie and ""Dead Silence"".",1307059200,5,1073,4.732620320855615
4413096,5,B004LWZW24,"Wow, this film was great.  It scared the mess outa me. I LOVED IT!!! I could have sworn that I had already reviewed this film. Oh,well...NE-Wayz, This film is about a sweet American Family with three children -two boys and a baby girl. Everything seems perfect about this family, mom works from home as a song writer, dads wears a suit and works outside the home and all is well in Mayberry. Then the sounds begin. Voices on the babymoniter, doorbells and banging and why is this happening? I don't want to spoil it but this movie is awsome.  One reviewer says this movie works well in the movie theater setting and I would have to agree with that person.  The bangs and the thumps and the hissing and yelling really have an effect with the theater sound system.  My favorite scene in the movie is when the mom is taking out the garbage and the song on the record player changes. Mom walks up to the house and peeks in the window to see... OMG!! You have to see this movie.  Some people didn't like the ""Ghostbusters"" but I loved them. They got a little corny, but overall I thought they were a neccessary comic relief (RELIEF being the operative word) this movie gets to the point where it is too scary and we just need a break. The ending picks it up again and I look forward to the sequal... A GOOD SEQUAL por favor.",1306540800,6,1319,4.323886639676114
4413097,3,B004LWZW24,"I went to The Cinema and saw this with my daughter. There is really not much of a story, as it begins  in a house with people unpacking. it had  some shocking moments which had my 28 year old daughter almost jumping out of her chair.. It reminded me sort of...of a Spook House at Halloween...everything is calm and suddenly something jumps out at you....The investigators were not that good..especially the older lady. They sort of left the ending hanging..but overall..it was an enjoyable movie.",1306281600,,496,4.823529411764706
4413098,4,B004LWZW24,"I know I'll get butchered by some for the title, but the tension in this film was stupendous.  At all the right times, in all the right places, the scares and thrills are there.  Sure, it's a hodge-podge of Poltergeist, Exorcist and Paranormal Activity, but each aspect of those movies is accentuated to produce a genuinely frightening combination.

After a family of five moves into a new home, it takes little time to realize something is wrong.  Items move, doors close.  When one child falls into a coma and the mother hears what sounds like Vin Diesel growling in some Gaelic dialect over the baby monitor, it's time to move despite the fact the father is a disbeliever.  Unlike the Jefferson's, moving on up doesn't work for this family and the frights return like ghost herpes.

While creative license was necessary to move the story along, the astral plane concept is not completely embraceable.  Nonetheless, the rest of the movie hits on all cylinders.  Visually there isn't a lot, but what is presented works very effectively.  All the scare techniques (e.g. eerie noises, well chosen music accompaniment, quiet-to-loud shocks, quick reveal scares) are expertly crafted and executed.  Epic timing on more than one occasion.  None of the actors really stand out, and a few (a Ghostbusters reproduction) were somewhat silly, but Lin Shaye must be recognized for her interesting performance as a medium who ties the entire movie into a sleep-stealing knot.

Impressed from beginning to end by this movie, I applaud the return to old fashioned, suspenseful horror that doesn't need a teenage sacrifice in a brothel, hostel, or abandoned building.  Not saying I dislike those, but Insidious is good for the change of pace.  The second half of the film is much slower than the terrifying first half, but if you've recently asked yourself, ""Whatever happened to the slow build up?""  Watch this in a dark theater with a great speaker system.  Guaranteed thrills.",1305158400,146,1965,4.978527607361963
4413099,3,B004LWZW24,"The movie is not great but it's not bad either. A couple, Josh and Renai, move into the old house they just bought, with their two young sons, Dalton and Foster, and baby daughter. Weird things begin to happen, the older son Duncan falls and slips into a coma, doctors indicate that there is no brain damage and the coma cannot be explained. The mother starts to see and hear things and persuades her husband that they need to leave this house. They move into another house but it's not really explained if they put this one up for sale, or how much time has gone by, or if the new house is theirs or if they have moved in with Josh's mother.

But Mom still sees and hears things and her mother-in-law, played by Barbara Hershey, does as well. She connects them to Elise, her paranormal investigator friend who arrives with her two investigators, Specs and Tucker, who are very funny.

Patrick Wilson is very good ok as the husband whose son Duncan is haunted and Lin Shaye is fantastic as the psychic. Rose Byrne plays the mother and Ty Simpkins the haunted son.

Suspenseful but not gory, good tension and atmosphere, it was worth seeing but not one that is worth watching again. I didn't like the ending at all though.",1304899200,4,1221,4.466367713004484
4413100,4,B004LWZW24,"Despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights
into The Further, INSIDIOUS does the job of keeping the viewer glued to
the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the
surprise ending delivers a final revelation. Patrick Wilson's performance
gives nothing away with regard to the film's last bit of shock value.
He's simply the husband who can't believe all he's expected to deal
with when Lin Shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monster.

One of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock
impact, but used in connection with what's happening on screen it does
manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror. Leigh Whannell's clever
script fairs better in the story's first half up until the arrival of a
team of specialists--but it's then that the horror elements reach their
peak.

***** POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****

It's just that the astral aspects of out of body experience don't carry
much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness
toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time it's
over.

Acting-wise, it's fine with good work from Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty
Simpkins--but it's Lin Shaye whom you'll ultimately remember in a very
intense and believable performance.

For thriller fans, this is not the blood and gore type of thing some
may be expecting--but an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games
with the viewer in a fascinating way. It's handsomely produced and
shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations. I found it an
extremely effective thriller.

Warning: You'll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if
you're willing to accept the startling premise of The Further.",1302998400,16,1725,4.850340136054422

The characters were great and you grow to care for them, the best character IMO us Elise who is in all the insidious films.  The two ghost buster type characters lend some much needed humor to what otherwise would be a very dark flick, they do not take away from the horror of the film though.

There are some truly scary moments throughout with the ghosts involved, this and the other insidious entry's are top notch.",1509580800,2,549,4.515151515151516
8435152,2,B004LWZW24,My family and I was looking to watch a scary movie when we came across this one. It has a very slow beginning and much of the movie didn't seem real. This made it a bit harder for me to like it because I like movies and books I can relate to. I found it to be not scary but strange. There was a few twists and turns but the ending was pretty predictable. I couldn't help but feel it needed a little more character developememt as well as development in the story line. This movie also had many jolting noises that had me antisapating what scary thing was about to take place next. This movie left me disappointed but wondering if there will be another part to it.,1506124800,,663,4.147286821705427
