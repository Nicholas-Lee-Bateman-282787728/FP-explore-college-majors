7476729,2,B016P0GXZE,"Sammy (Sean Faris) who has to work a double, comes home at lunch to surprise his wife (Rebecca Reaney) only to get more surprised as he catches her in the act with another man (Mehcad Brooks). At gun point we get their biographies and intimate details of the affair. This is a soap opera drama which is basically a three man play. Okay for what it was, I just didn't find it entertaining.

Based on true events in New Orleans, although I am sure this scenario has been played out more than once.

7476730,5,B016P0GXZE,"Watched this on netflix not knowing what to expect.
The movie presents a nightmare situation for anyone that has a strong love commitment to their partner. The man arrives home on his anniversary to find his wife in action with an unknown man and he is overwhelmed with emotion. His first reaction is to kill the both of them.
As the movie progresses a different scenario is presented as he holds the two of them by gunpoint. In his mind events that occur previously in the day weave themselves into his fantasy (pay attention to names etc). The desire to turn the tables is presented when the lover's wife is contacted and shows up to his house to turn the tables on the wife and lover.
The movie is a trip into the emotional storm of a nightmare event and remains intense throughout. After watching I could recall the hints and events that underscore the flow of the movie and feed the storm the husband was going through.
I thought the movie was well presented, well acted and well directed and although many reviewers did not like the ending I thought it to be correct to the theme and was like the period at the end of a sentence.
I will be looking for movies with the same director.",1489795200,3,1188,4.429223744292237

7476735,4,B016P0GXZE,"So, the concept of this story was actually very thought out, and even though the actors were not A list and reputable actors and actresses that some would have watched the movie for just because they were in it, was a very interesting take on what would you do or not do if you were put in this position, the movie itself I can only rate a four out of five. In my opinion, yes, was a good point of view to see this type of side of this to see play out. However, the story was a little rocky in some areas. First, the story seemed slow to unravel. Also, I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have not yet seen it, but in saying so, there were some cliff hangers that felt they needed addressing, but instead, the movie began to speed to an ending instead of an explanation to these seemingly important aspects to the grit of the story. I understand that they took a different route to try to clear up the story quickly, and the story be mainly what the ""ADULTERY""  was about, but I believe that the story could have ultimately received a five star rating, had it not tried to take the easy way out, and instead closed the book they opened on certain things that would have made the story better for the viewers.",1486339200,3,1218,4.182978723404255

7476753,1,B016P0GXZE,"SPOILER ALERT: If you have anything else to do with your day, and I mean anything, you should not watch this movie.

Well, I hope I spolied the possibility of you wasting your time with this crap fest.

Okay so I'll review the movie now. It stars a guy from Pretty Little Liars and co-stars his horrible accent. He tried. Bless his heart. There's also the guy from Supergirl. Not sure WHY he did this movie. Must have been helplessly bored. Um... Just a lot of talking, self-loathing, bible scriptures, crying, and head games. Remember, we are not sorry for our actions, but we are sorry we were caught.

I decided to rate this one star because giving it a quarter of a star isn't possible. (Let's start a petition for that!) The quarter of a star rating came from the part in the movie where the main character does something so diabolical, I thought, ""Well dang, I'll put that on my list of things to do if I catch my spouse cheating."" If you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. And no, it has nothing to do with shooting, guns, bullets, or hiding a body.

On second thoughts, watch the movie. Suffer like everyone else here.",1480118400,2,1144,4.407582938388626

7476757,1,B016P0GXZE,"Anyone that gives this movie more then 2 stars is either intellectually inferior, or got paid to give this ""movie"" a good rating.
The acting was bad. Anyone with half a brain can tell it was a low budget movie, and the director stating it was ""based on a true story"" was just to lure people with higher intelligence to watch the movie.
I was dissapointed in every aspect of the movie. Not only can no one prove this was based on a true story, but at the end of the movie it doesn't say anything about the true outcome of any of the people actors reenacted.
The director owes me 1-2 hours (however long the movie was) of my life back. Or someone will have to pay. ""True story"" -_-",1475884800,3,679,4.190839694656488

7476769,5,B016P0GXZE,"Stumbled on this movie and I'm really glad I did. It's an indie flick, filmed almost entirely in one bedroom. Basically the premise is a man comes home on his anniversary and discovers his wife has been cheating on him. Initially it's shown that he shoots and kills both of them straight away, goes downstairs, and sits on the couch. Flashes back  and instead shows him grabbing his guns and a bottle of whiskey and heads upstairs. From there he holds both his wife and her lover hostage and enacts some sort of trial. Hence his line, ""I'm the judge, jury, and executioner.""  The ending is a bit hazy, but my interpretation of it is that he did in fact kill them both in the first scene when he discovered them, and in some sort of psychotic break he imagined the rest (holding them hostage). We're shown other scenes where he got the names of the people he imagined, i.e., Damien's wife's name, Damien's nickname, and his wife's rapist. I enjoyed this movie solely because it makes you think: how would you react if you walked in on your significant other with someone else? Yes, Sean Faris had a terrible New Orleans accent, but at some point I overlooked it. I think it's one of the best indie films I've seen.",1466640000,29,1213,4.484162895927602

7476778,3,B016P0GXZE,"This movie was morbidly fascinating--I will remember it for some time to come--but not worth much more than the $1.65 I paid to watch it.  I give it three stars for suspense but overall, it's more of a two.  Samuel Dupree (Sean Faris) has the most god-awful New Orleans accent--when are filmmakers gonna realize nobody heah in Noo Aw'lins talks like that?!  As for being based on a true story, what this generally means is--as another reviewer so aptly put it--it's a story some writer half-heard while he was high on cocaine.

SPOILER ALERT:  I usually hate it when someone gives away the ending but this movie was so depressing, maybe I'll save somebody else from watching it.  Bottom line, Dupree comes home early on his one-year wedding anniversary bearing flowers & chocolates for his wife, Ashley (Danielle Savre), & discovers her in their bedroom having sex with Damien (Mehcad Brooks).  He shoots both adulterers straight off, no questions asked. Then he goes downstairs & sits on the couch & either dreams or imagines how things might have transpired had he waited awhile before killing them so hastily.  The ensuing interrogation at gunpoint & the visit from Damien's pregnant wife, Jasmine, all take place in his mind (it would have been a pretty short movie without them).  The last scene is a dead giveaway, pardon the pun. In one horrifying moment, Dupree realizes it was all an invention of his mind, a la The Usual Suspects.  As Damien told him just before he pulled the trigger, ""You did it to yourself, Punchy!""",1461456000,25,1529,4.801526717557252
