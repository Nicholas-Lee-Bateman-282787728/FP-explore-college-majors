1726961,2,B000068TSU,"My kids and I were really disappointed that this particular video ""Meet Joe!"" has only ""Joe's First Day"" and ""Joe Gets a Clue"".  It is missing ""Steve Goes to College""!  You have to buy a separate video called ""It's Joe Time"" to get ""Steve Goes to College"".  Or, buy the DVD called ""Get to Know Joe"".  I feel kind of cheated since on TV, they always showed the trilogy and this video seems like it should have all 3.",1036713600,4,415,4.215189873417722
1726962,5,B000068TSU,"This review is for the parents who don't have cable and have seen the new toys and don't know what they mean.  I have bad news and good news.  The bad news is that Steve Burns (Steve) has left the world of Blue's Clues behind to persue other interests. The good news is: This doesn't mean the show is over. A new person has stepped in as host. I have to commend Nickelodeon on something.  This new host is not a new Steve (green striped shirt, same haircut, just different person) nor was he sprung on the kids, as in one day Steve was there and one day he wasn't. Instead, Nick Jr. created a trilogy of episodes to do three things: introduce the new host, have the kids teach the host Blue's Clues, and provide a reason for Steve's departure. This video starts with Steve opening the door like usual, announcing it is Show and Tell  day.  A few seconds later, Steve gets a call from his brother Joe announcing he is coming over for Show and Tell. After a game of Blue's Clues to deduce what Joe is bringing, Joe arrives bringing his Show and Tell. Immediately upon his arrival, Joe asks the kds for help deducing what other friends brought for Show and Tell.  In Episode 2, you help Steve teach Joe Blue's Clues. Joe's eyes are also opened to skidooing into pictures, and joins in a game of hide-and-seek. In Episode 3, Steve reveals that he is off to college and that Joe is moving in to live with his new friends.  The kids get a look at Steve's ""college"" via skidoo, and help Joe plan a surprise party for Steve.  At the party, Steve says goodbye to all his friends, asking your kids to look after Joe because ""sometimes, he needs a little help."" Then, your kids see a preview of what will happen with Joe and hear the new opening number.  This is a wonderful transition video.  If your kids have only seen Steve up to this point, get this video, and by the end of it, your kids will be excited to have adventures with their new friend.",1030320000,11,1940,4.2904109589041095
1726963,5,B000068TSU,"This trilogy really deserves a BIG thumbs up!!! It's nice to see that the ""Blue's Clues"" people care enough about kids' feelings to take 2 years to figure out how to write Steve off the series, and it shows; the transition from Steve to Joe was very tastefully done. My 4 year old son was sad to see Steve leave, but happy that he was going to college. I highly recommend this video.",1024876800,,383,4.260273972602739

At least I have the Alphabet Power DVD in the car with us! My son and I love Blues Clues and while I can't watch the DVD while driving I definately have fun singing along. The bonus with this DVD I have found is that my son is learning so much! We bought him an alphabet puzzle not to long ago and with that and this DVD my 20 month old son now knows at least half of the alphabet. He runs up to us with the letters from his puzzle and says ""Z"" or ""K"" or ""E"". he is even learning what the letters ""say"" (what sounds they make).

All of the things in Blue's Room have incredibly annoying voices, including Blue.  And how come Blue can suddenly speak?  I mean, she can't talk in front of Joe or Steve, but...she can whine at everyone else when those guys aren't around?  This make NO sense to me.

The Blue's Clues episodes are great; just skip the Blue's Room episode, and you're all set to learn about the alphabet!",1285632000,4,543,4.836956521739131

This movie is different from Blue's Clues. It's like Blue developed a serious case of ADD (no disrespect intended)!  It's really fast paced, kind of chaotic, really jumps around, and the characters are kind of whiny and crazy.  It's not bad, just a really far cry from the quality show we've seen and expected.

1727390,4,B000068TSU,"In this DVD, Blue and her friends explore the alphabet, all the way from A-to-Z. The episodes on this DVD all fit that idea very well and together, it's a great package.

""Blue's Room: Alphabet Power"" contains an episode of ""Blue's Room"" and three episodes of ""Blue's Clues:""

""The Power of the Alphabet""

This is the new episode for this DVD --- a new ""Blue's Room"" story in which we join Blue and her playroom friends for an alphabet playdate. Of course, it's not an alphabet playdate without the alphabet and they're all there, from A-to-Z, all with little googly eyes on the top. Blue makes words with the letters and then pretends to be the words that they've made. We play Polka Dots' puzzles and receive letters to make a word. Later, a real kid joins Blue for a reading of the story ""Chicka Chicka ABC"" and the letters of the alphabet act out the story.

""The Alphabet Train""

Joe, Blue and all of our friends in the Blue's Clues house work together to create a train in which each of the cabs contain an item that starts with a different letter of the alphabet. ""B"" is blue, naturally and ""J"" is Joe, but we've still got a lot of letters left to go. We help out with this, even skidooing into a magnet board to find some things. As for Blue's Clues, we play the game to help Joe figure out what Blue wants to put in the very last cab of the alphabet train.

""Let's Write""

Nice one --- Joe and Blue have decided to make labels for all the different things in the house. We go around everywhere, helping them to make labels for things and also help to identify what things are based on already-existing labels. And for ""Blue's Clues,"" we help Joe to figure out a label that Blue wants to write.

""Magenta's Messages""

Magenta goes for a day-trip to the beach and asks Joe and Blue to take care of her house. To do this, she's left us a series of messages --- both a set of instructions and individual messages to complete the different tasks. These generally include pictures and words. While all of this isn't strictly alphabet-related, it still completes the set nicely.

These last two are bonus episodes for the DVD, although unlike past releases, they're no longer buried in the Special Features section. Instead, they're in the episode selection, under More Episodes, or you can also choose to play all episodes. Notice that there are no Steve episodes this time around --- if you or your kids don't like Joe, this DVD probably isn't the way to go.

This release also has a few special features:

Doodle, Doodle, Spell

A fairly simple game in which the player is given two letters of a word and a picture and fills in the missing letter. Also includes one with four letters. If the wrong letter is put in, you get a simple Try Again screen, but if you get the right letter, then the image animates and makes some noise. Not too bad of a game, but could have been jazzed up a bit.

Nicktrition Tips for Parents

A two-page thing to read giving tips on getting kids to try healthy foods and such. I imagine this info can also be found somewhere on the Nick Jr. website.

Blue's Room Spots

Three spots featuring either song numbers or Blue with real kids. About two minutes long in total, but still a nice addition.

Previews for these other shows:

Dora the Explorer --- double-length DVD releases

Blue's Room --- other Blue's Room DVDs

Rugrats --- Tales From the Crib Christmas special
