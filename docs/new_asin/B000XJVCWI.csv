From Lex saying ""Professional Football"" to Tully making sure that everyone knows he didn't go to school at the same time as Dusty to sports writers harassing JJ Dillon, just awesome.  No body stands in front of Ronnie Garvin two times.  Missy Hyatt is brilliant- glad the runaway train didn't take heads off.",1446336000,,341,4.745762711864407
8228700,1,B000XJVCWI,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this VHS you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each VHS I review has a ""Match of the VHS"" award somewhere in it.)

The Danger Zone
If you have a brain at all, you will not purchase this. This VHS is probably the worst pro wrestling product I have ever bought. You sit through 65 minutes of watching moves. That's right, no matches on this one. Magnum T.A. and Missy Hyatt host this VHS. All they do is welcome the next move and then you see a bunch of highlights from matches of the move. This might be bearable if this was from today, but this is from the old NWA. You literally have to sit through watching a segment on punches. This is horrible; Stay away from this one.",1216252800,7,932,4.325714285714286
