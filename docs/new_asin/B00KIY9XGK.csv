6432719,5,B00KIY9XGK,Excellent taijutsu!! Finally a teacher who understands how important it is to train the fundamentals. I strongly believe that even the most advanced techniques are nothing without a solid foundation to build upon. These dvd's are by far the best instructional videos in my collection.,1419206400,4,284,5.333333333333333
6432720,5,B00KIY9XGK,"This is an excellent DVD for grasping the fundamentals of Taijutsu and even applicable to the learning of other Japanese arts and martial arts in general.  This DVD is a good primer for entering the study of the Takamatsuden arts. It shows basics one needs to properly train in this classical Kobudo system.
I regret that there is no longer an affiliated Jinenkan dojo in the suburban Southern California area.  I wish there was a dojo like Yasuragi Dojo (the makers of this DVD) near me.  If you have any interest in classical Kobudo, buy this DVD. You won't be sorry.",1414627200,3,569,4.6138613861386135
6432721,5,B00KIY9XGK,Excellent DVD. As a beginner in Taijutsu I can see myself returning to view this over again as my training progresses. Anyone who likes to train in the basics will find this a welcome addition.,1402963200,4,193,4.542857142857143

8659408,5,B00KIY9XGK,"This video is highly recommended for anyone learning either the Bujinkan or descendant styles of Taijutsu.  The approach is from the Jinenkan tradition so expect very forceful and vigorous training  you're going to get a work out performing these techniques.

Ive purchased many learning videos on Taijutsu and the parent Bujinkan School (to include black belt study courses).  This has to be, hands down, among the best and most straight forward of them all.  Most other videos seem to start off with more advanced methods than a beginner student can handle; leaving confusion and poorly executed technique as a consequence.  Its as if theres an urge to get right to the cool parts of the course.

Not so this video, it starts off putting you in the correct frame of mind for training and then advances you, very logically and completely, through the basic stances, strikes, receiving strikes, and kicks.  Of most benefit (at least to me) are the simple drills shown to practice and enhance training.  While you absolutely will need a training partner and will do better with an instructor in a dojo setting, this video offers many drills that you can do yourself, and even more if you have a training partner.

The video quickly grabs and holds your attention; rapidly building to the point where you really want to perform the maneuvers you see in the video.  One thing I especially like is there are no slow motion set ups and dangling limbs that a sloth could grab to use in executing a technique.  Proper form is exhibited throughout with both training partners moving into and out of the techniques using proper guards and distancing both in execution and recovery.

One thing I found very helpful was the detailed explanations, like the ones Ive received in the dojos Ive been lucky enough to attend.  Also, when they are demonstrating technique in these videos, executing them in a manner so that you see the details of the technique, they let you know instantly: so theres no risk of learning an improper technique.

Theres very much more to this video and I think theres something here for everyone. It will remain an important reference wherever you are in your training progression, from beginner to Shodan.  Interestingly enough, this is the first video in which I actually enjoyed the little commercial they have for the school in the menu .  If I ever actually get to New York, I would not hesitate to stop in to visit the dojo.

If you're still not sure, go to You Tube and watch any of Adam Mitchells Jinenkan Dojo training videos.  They are all really good, but this video puts it all together for you in a handy training reference youll use over and over again.",1468454400,4,2681,4.739224137931035
8659409,5,B00KIY9XGK,"I would absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone who trains in the Bujinkan, Genbukan or Jinenkan. Sensei Mitchell demonstrates the basic techniques clearly and makes them easy to learn. This DVD has become a great reference guide in my library when I want to go back and train the basics. Sensei Mitchell's taijutsu is flawless in this training video and his presentation of the material is very professional and of high quality. If you're looking for a reference guide for kihon dakentaijutsu, this should be the one you buy.",1452384000,2,526,4.921348314606742
8659410,5,B00KIY9XGK,"Great instructional DVD on (introductory) Takamatsu-den striking techniques. Content is delivered in a logically-structured fashion; demonstrations are effective; Mr. Mitchell's presentation style is relaxed and engaging; DVD was clearly shot with high production quality in mind. Would recommend this DVD series as a top-quality training resource to anyone seeking insights into the Takamatsu martial arts, Mr. Mitchell's dojo operation, or the Jinenkan generally.",1450828800,,465,6.396825396825397
8659411,5,B00KIY9XGK,I really enjoyed this instructional video on Taijutsu and volume 1 was very helpful in my training.,1448409600,,99,4.882352941176471
8659412,5,B00KIY9XGK,". I have to say that this is the best set of DVDs with a focus on the Takamatsu-Den arts that I've run across. I initially bought the first three DVDs in your series, but after viewing Volume I (Daken), I immediately ordered the 4th DVD in the series. I found it very refreshing that you are steadfast in your approach to teaching the arts with the standards which have fallen out of popularity elsewhere, and it shows in the quality of the material covered in each DVD. I've been a student of Takamatsu-Den arts since 1993, when I ran across my first teacher working out of a wrestling room at Cal State Fullerton, and I haven't seen the arts practiced as he did until I put in the first DVD, so I am very grateful for that, considering some of the very bad habits condoned (even promoted) in some of the places I've studied since. I sincerely wish that there was a Jinenkan dojo in my area, as I appreciate how the Takamatsu-Den arts have been preserved & perpetuated within Jinenkan in a way which has disappeared from Bujinkan in their pursuit of more money. What truly stands out are some of the details you include on particular techniques, which is another thing which makes your DVDs stand head & shoulders above the rest. I would certainly be interested in any future material produced by your dojo, and you may rest assured that I am recommending your DVDs to my friends, especially the ones I regularly train with. Is there a possibility that sometime in the future, you may produce DVDs focused on the curriculum of particular Ryu? Once again, thank you for producing such incredible DVDs.",1444780800,2,1601,4.5625
8659413,5,B00KIY9XGK,"I recently received the Adam Mitchell Taijutsu DVDs, Vols 1-4, as a gift. These DVDs are among the most concise, descriptive, and informative collections of traditional Japanese martial arts instructional material I have encountered. Mr. Mitchell gives clear visual demonstrations of many techniques taught by Unsui Manaka through his Jissen Kobudo Jinenkan dojo in Japan. For those of us without access to personal, real time training, this DVD collection is a great place to start and build a fundamental knowledge of these traditional Japanese arts.",1443571200,,552,5.5058823529411764
