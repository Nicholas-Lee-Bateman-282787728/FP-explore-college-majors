1493935,5,B00005JL81,"Woody Allen has directed such pictures as Manhatten Murder Mystery,Annie Hall,Bananas,Sleeper,and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. But Hollywood Ending started a brand new era of Woody. The very first Woody film I saw was The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. When I heard of Hollywood Ending I knew I had to see it. Woody Allen(The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,Manhatten,Small Time Crooks)Tea Loine(The Family Man)and Debra Messing(The Mothman Prophecies)were the cast of this excellant film.
The Story:Meet Val(Woody Allen)a once famous directer with a great wife now a low director who is really nothing. He has a girlfriend who wants him to get more money(Debra Messing)and an agent Al who is his friend. When his ex-wife Ellie(Tea Loine)who left him for a guy named Hal(Treat Williams)decides that he is the best director for a movie her company made entitled THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS he decides this could be his comeback picture. Untill the unthinkable happens. His girlfriend is casted in the movie and she goes away for a little while to a gym and he goes blind. He thinking that he has a brain tumor goes to the doctor to learn it is just temporarly. Al is the only person who knows about and decides to walk him through the set and everything. He learns he was not allowed on the set so they confide in the translator of the cameraman who does not speak English. The secret has to be hid from the entire cast and crew because if they find out his comeback could be a flop. Expecially with the nosy writer who is writing a report on the making of the film.
So all in all this was out of the the two Woody Allen movies I saw a really great film in all ways possible. I look forward to Woody's next.
ENJOY!!!!",1020556800,3,1710,4.555194805194805
1493936,4,B00005JL81,"Since everyone complains about the ""old Woody"" being gone, they should be pleased with ""Hollywood Ending.""  It is definitely in the tradtition of ""Annie Hall"" ""Manhattan"" etc.  The subject matter, cinematography, sets, etc. are very similar.  So, if you're let down by the movie, it just may be because he has changed as a director and you have changed as a viewer.  I think this is as much ""old Woody"" as you're going to get, so stop complaining, or stop watching them.
OK, sorry about that little rant: I really liked the movie.  It's not perfect; I don't have any specific complaints except that the movie probably didn't have to rely on the main gag quite so much.  The new cinematographer really stuck out for me as being very good.  It's very fuuny also, and Tea Leoni was really good; she brought a fresh approach to the movie which is much different than Mia Farrow, Diane Keaton, etc.  I'm not a great movie reviewer, because it is all subjective, and nobody agrees, but I did enjoy the movie very much.  It was much more satisfying, I thought, than his last two films.",1020556800,4,1078,4.572916666666667
1493937,2,B00005JL81,"**1/2 Did your mother ever tell you that it wasn't polite to make fun of blind people?  Well, apparently, Woody Allen's mother didn't, since this is exactly what he does for a good hour or more in his latest film, ""Hollywood Ending."" (Or, perhaps, he just doesn't WANT to be polite).  Allen himself stars as Val Waxman, a once brilliant film director who has fallen on hard times, partly due to his own temperamental nature and partly to his own tendency for obsessive/compulsive behavior and chronic hypochondria, all of which have made him anathema to Hollywood's major producers.  Tea Leoni plays Val's ex-wife, Ellie, who convinces her current fianc, studio boss Hal (played by Treat Williams), to take a chance on Val and turn a multimillion dollar film project over to the iconoclastic director.  All is going well until, right on the eve of production, Val develops a case of psychosomatic blindness, a condition he and a few close allies try to keep a secret during the making of the film.  The majority of ""Hollywood Ending"" revolves around Val's attempts to keep people from finding out the truth and delivering a creditable motion picture to the studio heads at the same time.
In many ways, this pallid comedy combines the slapstick elements of Allen's early works (""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"") with the cynicism of his later, more mature explorations of modern urban romantic life (""Annie Hall,"" ""Manhattan"").  Unfortunately, ""Hollywood Ending"" winds up as an uneasy hybrid of the two forms, mixing lowbrow comic mugging and pratfalls with the customary angst-ridden dithering that Allen has been indulging in (often quite effectively) for well nigh a quarter of a century now.  Well, the bloom is definitely off the rose here.  Part of the problem is that Allen's neurotic tics are amusing only when he has some serious points to make under all the humor.  In this film, however, he is providing no insights to go along with the chatter so that he comes across as whiney and self-absorbed rather than witty and ironical.  Val always seems to be blathering a mile a minute, so much so that we finally just want him to shut up and give us a moment's silence.  To make matters worse, the scenes of broad physical comedy - Allen bumping into furniture, Allen breaking glasses, Allen falling off platforms - are not particularly well executed, lacking the kind of adept, split second timing essential to make such scenes comically effective.  Thus, the film fails on two levels:  both as a work of slapstick and as a verbal comedy of ideas.  The film could, potentially, have scored as an acerbic satire on the ludicrous commercial values that define the American film industry, yet even most of these ""inside"" jokes seem strangely unoriginal and old hat, especially coming from a man as attuned to the industry as Woody Allen.
Although Allen, in his old age, has degenerated into little more than a wan parody of himself, Tea Leoni sparkles as Ellie, creating a character who is simultaneously strong, sensible, insecure and vulnerable.  Leoni's performance is, literally, the anchor that keeps this otherwise lighter-than-air trifle from floating away completely.  Barney Cheng does a nice job playing a Chinese translator whom Val uses to help him carry off this impossible charade; Mark Rydell provides some memorable moments as Val's helpful agent; and Debra Messing glows as Val's beautiful but bubble headed ""significant other,"" who is far more concerned about losing her part in the movie than losing her role as bedmate to the neurotic director.
It would be unfair, as well as untruthful, to say that ""Hollywood Ending"" did not afford a couple of pretty impressive laughs along the way.  This IS a Woody Allen film, after all.  And even Woody on a bad day is better than many of our Hollywood humorists on a good day.  But with so many great films in his oeuvre, one naturally goes into this film with high expectations.  When a final assessment is made of all of Allen's prodigious cinematic output, ""Hollywood Ending"" will wind up somewhere very near the bottom of the list.",1020470400,3,4089,4.915697674418604
1493938,3,B00005JL81,"Although nowhere near the greatness of Woody's movies of the 80s (when he could seemingly do no wrong and did just about everything WAY better than right), Hollywood Ending has enough Allenesque humor to make it a better entry than he's offered for some time.
Allen here constantly mocks himself without the bitterness seen in Deconstructing Harry.  He plays a director near the end of his career--not agewise, but workwise--whose girlfriend is significantly younger (and dumber) than he is.  The film opens on a hilarious note, showing him bundled up in sub-zero clothing, shooting a commercial in northern Canada in the midst of a blizzard.  The juxtaposition of his whiny voice as he complains to his girlfriend via cell phone and the snowstorm setting, requiring heavy impersonalizing clothing, is truly inspired.
The rest of the film does not approach that degree of inspiration although there are a number of small scenes and/or situations that come close.  He's offered a script by his ex-wife (Tea Leoni) who persuades her current boyfriend, a wealthy Hollywood producer (Treat Williams), to go with him even though Williams can't stand him.
On the first day of the new film shoot, he goes blind, psychosomatically, and while first using his agent (played convincingly by Mark Rydell) as his seeing-eye, he's forced to replace Rydell, and goes with the Chinese translator for his Chinese cameraman who speaks no English.  The translator's English is so formal that here again, the juxtaposition of this stiff language with Allen's neurotic babble is very funny.
But alas, the translator is let go and Allen needs a seeing-eye substitute.  From this point on, the film is not bad, but aside from a scene with Allen and Williams where Allen has had to memorize where everything in a room is located--and, predictably, fails, resulting in some comical pratfalls and other humorous moments--the sparkle is definitely diminished.
This is brought home in a very strained scene with his son who's now a punk musician, complete with dyed hair, nose ring, etc.  The humor, what little there is here, is too forced and makes the viewer understand that the only reason for the scene is that Woody wishes he had had a son of his own.  There's an equally strained scene between Leoni and Williams as they argue about the film.  These intervals of ""drama"" do much to weaken the spirit of the comedy and are the primary reason for three stars.
Still this is signficantly better than Woody's last flaccid outing, Curse of the Jade Scorpion, and is worth seeing for what comedy there is.  The ending of the film is, in fact, a Hollywood ending, full of romance and good news.",1020470400,,2666,4.930803571428571
1493939,4,B00005JL81,"There have been many who feel Woody Allen has been slipping lately with films like ""Sweet and Lowdown"", ""Everyone Says I Love You"", ""Small Time Crooks"", & his last film, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"". Many people refused to see the charm these films had. Now, while ""Crooks"" and ""Scorpion"" were not great Woody Allen films, they both proved to be entertaining and funny. I too yearned for Allen to make a more semi-series film. Something that would give him the chance to really throw himself into his material. Well, the wait is finally over! Woody Allen's lastest comedy\drama ""Hollywood Ending"" finds Allen to be in top form and is his best film since ""Deconstructing Harry"" (Which I claim as Allen's funniest film of the 90's). ""Hollywood Ending"" sets such a perfect tone to it. The characters are wonderful and well thought out, the jokes work, Allen keeps the one-linners at a nice steady pace. Not too many jokes where the plots seems to be secondary, but, just enough jokes where we (The audience) aren't bored. I have three minor complaints about this film, and I'll get to them later, but, as for now, ""Hollywood Ending"" is one of the year's best films!
 Woody Allen plays Val Waxman, a once great filmmaker, who sadly has declined over the years. He can't find work, and when he does, he either gets fired or quits. He bores his girlfriend, Lori (played nicely by Debra Messing, who has already appeared in one Allen film, ""Celebrity"") about ""the old days"", when Waxman was a major Hollywood player and managed to win two Academy Awards. But, Waxman needs a break. He needs someone to take a chance on him, and he finds someone, only it's his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni, she's in top form herself, at times she steals the film from Allen, I could see an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress) and if that's not bad enough the head of the studio where Ellie works is not only her boyfriend\soon to be husband, but, it's the same man Ellie had an affair with when she was married to Val!
 Of course, as one could imagine, Val doesn't want to take on the project, and to be honest, neither does the studio really. Hal (Treat Williams), the head of the studio, thinks that bringing Val on as director will be too risky. Ed (George Hamilton), another studio excutive also thinks Val is the wrong man for the job. But, Val knows he could do wonders with the script, which is a remake of an old 40's noir film, ""The City That Never Sleeps"".
 Soon Val finds out from his agent, Al (Mark Rydell, now while Rydell is fine in the movie, I could of also seen Mel Brooks playing the role, imagine how that would of turned out, the two greastest comedy directors of their time together in a film.) that he got the job, but, all is not perfect, Val goes blind! Everything I've just explain found it's way into the trailer for the film, so not to worry, I didn't give away any of the film's ""secrets"".
 ""Hollywood Ending"" right from the opening moments listening to Bing Crosby sing ""Going Hollywood"" over the credit, let me know I was in for something special. I have not seen Allen better than in this film. I think people (well most of them anyway) are going to enjoy this film. Yes, of course there will be those who say they don't like seeing Allen act alongside younger women, and yes there will be those who say the film reflects Allen's own life all to well, but, to these people I must say, you missed the whole joy of the movie. Stop nit-picking about these small details.
 Here are the films ONLY 3 ""REAL"" faults. 1- It goes on for about 10 minutes too long. 2- Not enough screen-time for Debra Messing, who's character could have amounted to something better than what it was. And finally 3-No need for Tiffani-Amber Thiessen character except for one joke, but then again it's a funny joke.
 Bottom-line: Woody Allen has struck comic gold with ""Hollywood Ending"". It's his best film in years and also one of the year's best films. A very thoughful, funny film!",1020384000,4,3976,4.538354253835426
1493940,3,B00005JL81,"I saw this at a free screening earlier in the week and that might have made the laughs easier to come by, but it was still quite amusing and fun.  Allen seems years past his prime when he had his pulse on the mores of urban life in the late 70s and early 80s.  As a 60-something, his screen persona is grayer but no wiser.  This is a lighter-fluffier Woody that brings back the old New York-Hollywood dialectic and has fun with it.  It's just not the big and innovative work we used to see from him.  For an Allen film, it seems surprisingly restrained in lanquage, PG-13 for sure.  If you're not crazy about Woody, wait for the video.

1493941,3,B00005JL81,"What a relief to finally see an intelligent comedy without any gross scenes!  Of late, comedies have been more and more gross, thanks mainly to the sickening trend set by movies like 'There is something about Mary'.  Woody Allen deserves credit for giving us 'Hollywood ending', a film that has some very funny moments.
Woody Allen plays a washed-out film director, whose wife (played by Tea Leoni) has left him for a film producer (Treat Williams).  Then this script comes into the hands of Treat Williams and his film company ('Galaxie films') and Tea Leoni thinks that Allen will be the best choice to direct it.  She convinces Williams and his friends and then the laugh riot starts!  Allen meets his ex-wife and the decision makers of Galaxie films and seals the deal (with some very funny scenes!).  Come the first day of shooting and Woody Allen becomes blind (psychosomatic blindness).  The rest of the story revolves around how he (with Tea Leoni's help) keeps his blindness a secret from everyone else and manages to direct the film.
Woody Allen is very very funny and steals many a scene, with the best one being the one in which he meets Tea Leoni at a restaurant after he lands the directing job.  Leoni supports him very well and Debra Messing ('Will and Grace') plays Allen's new (and not so bright) girlfriend.  All the supporting actors are good, with the Chinese cameraman and his translator being the pick of the lot.
Needless to say, the film directed by the blind Woody Allen gets horrible reviews initially, but then there is a twist in the climax that justifies the title - 'Hollywood ending'.  The funny moments keep the film up and running and in the end, this is surely worth watching at least once.",1020211200,34,1725,4.700996677740863

1494070,4,B00005JL81,"I don't know where to begin with this review? But I guess I could say, 'I miss Woody.' And I've been missing his style of direction. Though most of all, I've missed seeing him in front of the camera.

Well the good thing is that back in 2002 (where WAS I in 2002, that I COMPLETELY missed this film?) he WAS back in FRONT of the camera!!! And good thing too! Because there's something about a Woody Allen performance that only he can turn out.  You know, all the anxiety and neuroses.  I believe in this one, he talks about NOT liking to sleep alone. Only that's the tip of the iceberg.

The thing with this story is, is that it's about a director who had been quite successful during the 70's and 80's, only now he is lucky to get a job shooting a commercial in Canada.  In so many words, it's like he's all washed up.

Only the good thing is that his former wife is now a movie executive who is currently engaged to a film producer who is about to shoot a film that is just up his alley.

Everything is looking to go great--he takes the meeting with the producer, he actually gets the job (no kidding) and then he becomes blind--in the actual pychosomatical sense.

This is where things start to go into the slapstick. And it's all just so great.

Just trying to watch Woody Allen try to fudge his way into making everyone think he can still see  while he is trying to direct this movie is something else.

The sight gags alone, are what is worth watching this film for.

There's a scene where he and Tea Leoni are going over where all the furniture is at in this hotel suite where he and Treat Williams are going to meet, that's practically up there with the old Abott and Costello routine of 'Who's on First'. I mean, really. And then there's the whole part when Woody gets to meet with Treat Williams.  That whole scene was classic.

I also really enjoyed the scenes with Woody and the character of his son. (Even the scene with Woody and his therapist--where they talked about the relationship that he had with his son was very nice and quite revealing--almost like he was talking about his REAL son.)

Overall, I'd say that Woody still has it. This movie HAS it. And any Woody Allen fan has GOT to see this. I know I'm glad I did!!!",1310169600,,2239,4.285035629453682

Just before the film is going to commence, Allen suffers from psychosomatic blindness. With the help of his agent and then his wife, he proceeds and successfully films the movie after many obstacles along the way. The ending is surprising as well. The movie was plain ordinary for me but there were many situations through the movie which made it viewable till the very end. The writing is sarcastic and translated effectively to the big screen. There are many characters in the movie that make the movie interesting and come alive. The Chinese translator and the camera man are for one a very funny bunch. The reunion scene with son is also very hilarious. Woody Allen is as his usual self, neurotic, self obsessed and witty. Not his best but for a cut above the rest.

1494074,4,B00005JL81,"As I noted in a review last year of Woody Allen's classic Annie Hall, that is among other things a defense of New York City as the cultural epicenter American culture such as it is, this is matter that has preoccupied him from early in his career as a director/ writer/actor/comic. Allen is the quintessential New Yorker so one knows where his sledge hammer will fall. In the current movie under review Hollywood Ending that same premise underlies his story line as he, once again, portrays on screen the trials and tribulations of trying to maintain some kind of artistic integrity in the world of Hollywood commercial filmmaking.

The plot here centers on Allen's character Val Waxman, an aging has-been director given another chance by, of all people, his ex-wife getting paralyzed by the prospects to such an extent that he has become temporarily blind. Nevertheless in the interest of comedy and his career (and their careers, as well) Val and his friends con their way through the filming of the remake of a 1940's film about New York City that is to be the key to his comeback. Along the way Allen gets to get his licks in on Hollywood culture, commercial filmmaking and the funny premise that commercial films are so dumb, for the most part, that a blind man is entirely capable of making a bad film, just like most other directors. Interesting film and, as always, full of autobiographical references, Allen's trademark cerebral humor and his extensive use of sight gags. Well worth a look see.",1203379200,,1503,4.780769230769231

One of Allen's self-described ""trifles,"" it casts the Woodman as a down on his luck director whose ex-wife persuades studio boss Treat Williams to give him one last shot at directing a major film. On the eve of production, he goes blind, a psychosomatic response to the way the plot parallels his personal life.

It's popular to suggest that since hitting 60, Allen's comic timing is off, but I laughed frequently as the blind director fumbled his way across the film set and engaged in conversation while facing an empty seat on the sofa rather than the person he's addressing. The movie within the movie turns out to be a disaster, of course, but it's hailed by the French critics. The ending mirrors Allen's own career these days. Once the fair-haired boy of American critics, Allen must now go abroad to find a receptive audience.

1494077,2,B00005JL81,"In Hollywood Ending, Woody Allen plays a once-great director with the reputation of being hard to work with. He's in need of a comeback project to get him out of directing TV commercials. A chance comes from an unexpected place, his ex-wife, who is now engaged to the head of a studio. She lobbies hard for Allen's character to direct a new movie about New York City. Despite tremendous reservations, he is hired and begins his great comeback. However, in the few days before shooting, he develops a case of temporary blindness. Not wanting to blow his big chance, he directs the movie anyway with the help of his agent/friend and the translator for the Chinese cameraman. When the translator gets fired, he confides in his ex-wife and she helps him because the movie is over half-way done.

The premise of this movie is a good one I think, but it just wasn't funny. The cast is very good and they all try hard, but I didn't laugh out loud once only smiled a few times. The movie doesn't take any chances, all the jokes are too tame. Woody is a hypochondriac (haven't seen that before), Woody walks into a wall (he's blind, remember?), Woody looks the wrong way when talking to people, people keep asking him things like 'which color do you like best?', 'which prop clock do you want to use?'. It all begins to repeat itself and it wasn't funny the first time. Woody Allen also continues to stretch credibility with the lovely women he casts.

1494135,4,B00005JL81,"Woody Allen's deliberate but successful attempt to make a joke on himself. Even non Woody Allen fans like me can get it. Woody Allen was Val Waxman, a director at a low point of his career. Ellie (Tea Leoni) was his ex-wife who left him for the studio head Hal Jaeger. Out of her faith in Val, Ellie went out of her way to convince the studio to let Val direct a 60-million budget A-class film in New York - Val's specialty (first similarity). This was to be a comeback (second similarity) Val much needed.

The first half had a little bit too much talk with Val constant wining about Ellie's abandoning him 10 years ago. Yet once Val actually started to direct the film, an insurmountable obstacle came up. The movie immediately took a comic turn and became highly watchable. Debra Messing and Geroge Hamilton also appeared.

Tea Leoni, as a down-to-earth film producer was practical and Woody Allen must be credited for not asking her to portray a love struck romantic falling for the great and talented director. Throughout the film, she was more to him a loyal friend which was utterly convincing.

The story wrapped up neatly and headed for an unexpected ending - both hilarious and truly romantic. His reunion with his son is fun to watch. Some dialogues were memorable. ""Inertia kept two-thirds of the marriages and love kept one-third."" ""This's really the work of a blind man"" ""Husbands should all be blind for some time."" The joke on the French was actually quite bold (Afterall they have been Woody's steadfast supporters) and kept me laughing for some time. And the icing on the cake was a touch of romance and relationship in the end.

This was actually Woody Allen's self-reflection (as perceived by Hollywood studios) projected on the director Val Waxman - his style (more individualistic and nervous), his work (arty rather than mainstream) and his audience (more European than Hollywood). By stating his profile in the past, it is as if Woody Allen is ready to take a more proactive and commercial approach. By making a Hollywood film to tell of his ""unHollywood"" traits, this seems more like a Hollywood beginning for him - Match Point (good film) and Scoop are movies made for Hollywood.

The actors are all doing best jobs, but the material such as the entangled relations between men and women (or ex-husband and ex-wife) is not fresh any more.  In short, 'Hollywood Ending' is occasionally funny, but at the same time is more likely to remind you that Woody Allen back in the 70s and 80s was a real genius.

The film about a film director Val Waxman played by usual Allen's wacky performance.  Val is a two-time Oscar winner, but a difficult person to work with (unlike Allen himself, perhaps), so now he is hired to shoot a commercial in Canada.  Even that job he couldn't finish, for before he quits, he is fired.

However, because of his ex-wife Ellie (Ta Leoni), who persuaded Hollywood honcho producer Hal (Treat Williams) to give Val another chance, major film company 'Galaxie' offered him a job -- a very big one for Val, who knows he cannot fail this time.

[DIRECTOR WHO CANNOT SEE] But -- here is the point -- when the shooting starts, Val suddenly went blind, owing to too much tension.  Hiding this fact from the whole crew except the faithful agent Al (Mark Rydell), Val continues his jobs, pretending that he can see.  His strangely nervous behaviors are all attributed to his being 'auteur' for, you know, any great director should have peculiar habits, do they?

Allen's zany one-liners are very funny, and the film's surprise conclusion is a witty one that would please the film fans in America and Europe alike, but the film can never shake off the feeling that it is too long in showing the unnecessary dialogues.  Though her acting is good, Ms. Leoni does not look like Val's ex-wife, and moreover, why does she (you know, her character is a film producer) insist on giving her ex-husband a job?  Her decision, or the romance part of the film for that matter, never sounds real.

Another problem about the film is that the interesting situation about the blind director is not fully used, and Allen's satire on Hollywood is not particlarly inspired or insightful.  To me at least, the Hollywood represented by Treat Williams or George Hamilton looks like the Hollywood in the 1950s, not 2000s.

Finally, as you know, Woody Allen never stops making films.  His films are like annual festival to his fans, but not all of his new outings are not, it seems, welcomed now.  Remember, we saw hilarious ""Bananas,"" ""Sleeper,"" and immortal ""Annie Hall"" in the 70s.  In the 80s we enjoyed watching more philosophical ""Manhattan,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  But somehow around the time of ""Deconstructing Harry (in 1997) and ""Celebrity"" (in 1998), things started to look different.  ""Hollywood Ending"" is better than lengthy ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" but compared with the great films in the past, it is still disappointing.",1117065600,3,3105,4.753731343283582
1494140,3,B00005JL81,"Is it possible that Woody Allen, one of America's last true auteurs if you listen to the French, has beaten deconstruction at its own game? In DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, his frenzied and often ferociously funny 1998 film, Allen's onscreen character Harry Block admits to a small group of college professors that the persona of his novels was in fact, and in the end, himself. The ripple effect of that moment is crystallized by the fact that we see Allen the director shooting a scene written by Allen the writer in which Allen the actor admits a prevailing similarity to Allen the man. In press reports released at the time of the film's release, Allen denied any personal connection to the Harry Block character, saying that the blocked writer was instead based on Philip Roth. He further cited Elliott Gould and Dennis Hopper both as actors to whom he first offered the role before playing it himself. And so the artist again pulls down the blinds between his work and his life (a favorite and recurring motif that runs throughout the Allen oeuvre, as the French and not-yet working film students would say).

Which brings us to HOLLYWOOD ENDING (2002), one of Allen's most recently released films. Its premise sounds promising enough: once-great Hollywood artiste Val Waxman finally gets another shot at directing a prestige picture: the only problem is that his ex-wife Ellie (Tea Leoni) has thrown the deal his way out of guilt, and the studio head Hal Yaeger (Treat Williams) is the man for whom Val's ex-wife has left him. Recognized internationally as a neurotic artist with, as Ellie caustically remarks, ""All of the symptoms and none of the disease,"" Val finds himself stricken with a case of psychosomatic blindness the night before the shoot begins. Faced with the prospect of never directing a Hollywood picture again, Val is coerced by his agent Al Hack (Mark Rydell) and ultimately aided by Ellie to direct the picture blind.

The ensuing complications bring Val and Ellie back together again, opens Val's eyes (so to speak) to the root of his temporary blindness (an estrangement from his twenty-something son Tony, a punk rocker who eats rats live on stage and answers to the new name ""Scumbag X""), and accords him further acclaim from French film critics in the face of critical and popular failure back home in the States. Upon learning that his U.S. flop has found favor in France, Val's ironically grateful throwaway line ""Thank God the French exist"" brings Allen full circle -- the auteur brought face to face with a theory of critical analysis that further legitimizes his creations.

The issue of ""creation"" is what remains the thorn in my side or, if you will, the blindfold across my eyes when dealing with HOLLYWOOD ENDING. After a love affair with the films of Woody Allen that stretches now over more than two decades, I have to admit that I genuinely dislike HOLLYWOOD ENDING. The maddening thing is that I think I am supposed to not like it.

Consider the playfulness of a filmmaker like Allen, whose recent annual output has been regarded by many (myself included, on most occasions) to resemble meager rivulets more than the vastly rich rivers and occasional oceans of his previous film efforts. Postmodern thinking aside, the films seem to evoke a feeling more of disintegration than of deconstruction. From ANNIE HALL (1977), we go to ALICE (1990); from STARDUST MEMORIES (1980) to SHADOWS & FOG (1992); and, most unforgivably perhaps, from the stunning artistic triumph of CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS (1989) to the criminally mediocre twin package of SMALL TIME CROOKS (2000) and CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION (2001). As time has passed, the jokes have grown staler, comic bits and entire fragments of dialogue have more or less been recycled from earlier films, and the Woody persona has grown increasingly rattled and (yes) old. The only image from these later films that seems to be shooting directly from the man's heart into the camera and ultimately through the projector lens is the image of a skywriter etching the words HELP across the Manhattan skyline in the film CELEBRITY (1999).

Yet what leaps out at the viewer most insistently in HOLLYWOOD ENDING is the director's self-conscious realization that he is being watched, judged, evaluated, and ultimately excoriated by a fickle viewing public to whom he has grown blind -- only Allen himself knows whether or not this blindness is intentional or not. As a moviegoer, you are confronted by what your senses tell you is a good director's bad film about a good director's bad film. The pretzel logic of the complaint becomes the film's compliment: If you hate the film, then the film has succeeded. The Allen persona himself again admits on screen that, ""This time, they're right -- the film is incohesive."" Is this film's complicity in its own guilt as something bland and mediocre the very core of its ticklish genius? More important for the filmgoer, is this paradox alone worth the price of admission? Perhaps the most important admission to place on the table is Allen's admission that he knows he is making a bad ""Hollywood"" movie.

Living up to the film title, Val and Ellie reunite and run off to that most prototypical of romantic Hollywood endings: life, love, and art in Paris (witness a similar happy-ending play in HBO's ""Sex and the City"" series). But what are we really seeing end here? I actually think that HOLLYWOOD ENDING represents the death of the Woody Allen persona as we have known him: a neurotic schlemiel who nevertheless is cool, reserved, and who nearly always swings and scores with a seemingly endless variety of beautiful and progressively younger leading ladies. The disparity of age between Allen and leading lady Leoni is not nearly as painful to watch as the age gap between Woody and Helen Hunt in CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, but it does strain credibility -- and I think that Allen knows it. The final image of HOLLYWOOD ENDING then shows a limousine driving Allen and Leoni away from the camera and into a future that we are to assume involves airports, passports, and snails. However, that shot lingers long and feels more like a quiet procession in a funeral for the Allen persona as we've come to know him. It appears he's simply grown too old to remain our romantic clown, has grown too bent to bend us to the belief that he can still exist as that image. Just as Chaplin did with his ""little Tramp"" screen persona in MODERN TIMES (1936), we see ""Woody"" travel away from us down a road that will take him away from us and away from the screen.

Will Woody maintain absence from the screen? Well, already in ANYTHING ELSE (2003), the Woody character has been reconstructed as an older, wiser mentor type to a younger actor, Jason Biggs. And now in MELINDA & MELINDA (2005), he only writes and directs. However, the movie poster drapes his trademark thick-frame glasses across the comedy/tragedy painting of the Melinda character's face - so he exists now more as film signifier than film character. Looking back a few years later, HOLLYWOOD ENDING now seems to stand as Allen the ""auteur"" 's full and final admission to all of us that he has gotten older, has changed, and will die, even if the upshot of art is that you live forever in the creativity you leave behind.",1115942400,3,7295,4.8218849840255595

This movie gives Allen a chance to get a bit more serious than he did with ""Small Time Crooks"" and ""Jade Scorpion"". The movie has a very funny premise and I found myself laughing aloud quite a few times. I understand lately it has not been the ""in"" thing to praise Woody Allen.

It's about a ""yesterday's news"" kind of filmmaker (Woody Allen) who has been hired by his ex-wife's husband to make another big movie, possibly propelling him back into the Hollywood spotlight.

The movie really gets going when Woody Allen's character develops some kind of temporary blindness during filming.  But because he doesn't want to miss his big break, it's kept a secret from everyone except his ex-wife and the cinematographer's (who is foreign and doesn't speak a word of English) interpretor.

Unfortunately, the heart of this movie is also the movie's downfall.  Most moviegoers (especially the kind who enjoy Woody Allen movies) do not like Hollywood endings.  So, for a filmmaker like Woody Allen to say, ""We're going to build a movie on the very thing that people don't like to see in movies,"" is nothing short of an insult to the audience.

1494208,2,B00005JL81,"This film seems to suggest a Woody Allen in his decadent phase.  Throughout his long career, he has played opposite a series of brilliant actresses of varying ages. At first, the sight of Debra Messing playing house with Woody in this film is unsettling at best. At worst it illustrates the master filmmakers obsessive and pathetic need to present himself as a viable Romantic-type lead still capable of nailing hot, young chicks.  The real problem is that there are very few male leads who Allen can vicariously express his peculiar brand of neurotic narcissistic angst through. We are left with Woody--who still manages to project just enough frail believability so that the story can move on from a rather implausible yet not impossible beginning.
Woody plays a once-great filmmaker, Val Waxman.  He's everything a Woody character should be: hypochondriac, paranoid, bitter and caustic. At the start of the film, he's up in Toronto filming a commercial that is very much beneath his stature.  The film centers around a basic premise:  Val's ex-wife, Ellie, (Ta Leoni)  has decided that he is perfect to direct the screenplay she has just finished for her new boyfriend Hal Jaeger's studio.  The conflicts are obvious and ripe for comedic exploitation that never really materializes. The tensions between Val and Hal (his new boss and the man who stole his wife) do not exist.  Although there are many fine performances, there is little chemistry on screen.  Ta Leoni  is fabulous, but the screentime she shares with Woody has no fire.  There is nothing between the two actors that suggests the supposedly tulmultuous past of the characters. Debra Messing is equally great as Val's latest flame, but she's stuck with an extremely limited role and isn't integral to the plot whatsoever.
Indeed, the plot meanders for quite a while and eventually devolves into a long, torturous episode involving Val's psychosomatic blindess and his attempts to hide it from everyone associated with the studio.  Everything else is fitted into that basic premise. It allows for Val and Ellie to spend quite a bit of time together, although the pairing is nothing of note and comes off as rather superfluous to the story as a whole. The bottom line is that this film has no soul.  It isn't worthy of Woody Allen at his best and wastes a talented cast.",1088985600,,2334,4.938618925831202

Woody plays his usual character- insecure and self-absorbed. He is a failing filmmaker whose movies are bombing the US. His ex-wife had left him for the studio exec who is financing the picture he's now making. The stress of it all leads to psychosomatic blindness in Allen, who without anyone's knowledge of his condition, attempts to make a film while sightless.
Perhaps the greatest drawback to HE is the casting. Although I love Tea Leoni, she's really far too young to play sixty-ish Allen's ex. In the best of his films, Allen populates them with strong actors and characters that give them depth and complexity. The cast here is simply not as strong as in his other films and it suffers somewhat for it.
And while this isn't any near his Hannah or Manhattan standard, it's still an enjoyable and fulfilling ""middle"" Woody Allen film.",1080950400,2,977,4.78698224852071

While the subject of the movie is indeed the film industry, Hollywood Ending is no more a satire of that system than America's Sweethearts was.  Both seemed to promise more than they delivered, and neither had the sardonic bite of Blake Edward's scathing SOB.  Allen can't or won't muster up that anger, and so Hollywood Ending ends up being nothing more than another vehicle for Allen to display and parody his own neuroses.  Granted, there are some very funny lines, but mostly Allen seems pretty self-satisfied at his own cleverness--never more literally than when one character compares directing a film to masturbation.  I'm reminded of the Saturday Night Live skits of the Woody Allen fan club in many ways--once you're past the concept, the charm of seeing a Woody Allen caricature fails rather quickly.",1079740800,,931,4.980645161290322

Probably Allen's best film since `Deconstructing Harry' at least, `Hollywood Ending' is a clever zing directed at Hollywood's studios and film producers, in which Allen plays a characters very obviously based on himself, as he happily bites the hand that fids him. Since Woody Allen's characters will always look like Woody Allen anyway, it's nice to see him in this very personal and earnest role. `Hollywood Ending' is classic Woody Allen, a sure pleaser for fans and also for anyone who enjoys a funny, classy and intelligent comedy.
Woody plays Val Waxman, an eccentric, hypochondriac has-been acclaimed film director, given one last chance to make his comeback; however, on the first day of the shooting, he develops psychosomatic blindness. That is the premise; the rest is terrific physical comedy, with subtle satirical and cynical humor, in the finest Allen tradition. Although all the actors are terrific - Tea Leoni as Val's ex, the wonderful Mark Rydell as his agent, and Mark Webber (`Storytelling') in one show-stopping scene as his son, Scumbag X (don't ask) - but Allen, admittedly not much of an actor himself, steals the show, making it the most Allen-ish movie since `Harry', yet also one of his most accessible films.

1494213,3,B00005JL81,"In ""Hollywood Ending,"" Woody Allen plays Val Waxman, a film director who is on his way to bottoming out.  However, he gets a big break when his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni) recommends him to direct ""The City That Never Sleeps"" for Galaxie Studios.  When one studio executive worries that, with all due respect, Val is ""a raving, incompetent psychotic,"" Ellie immediately defends him by declaring ""He's not incompetent.""  However, while Val has this big opportunity to restore his fading reputation, there are a few problems.  First, and these are in no particular order, his girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing), thinks she is perfect for a part in the film.  Second, while his request for a foreign cinematographer is approved by the studio, the guy they hire is Chinese and does not speak English.  Third, the first day of shooting Val suddenly becomes blind.  It might be psychosomatic, but blind is blind.  Val thinks he should quit, but his agent does not see this as being that much of a problem.
The blind director bit ends up becoming a shaggy dog story on which Allen hangs a series of jokes about the Hollywood studio system he has endured and/or taunted from afar for most of his career in making movies.  All of Val's ideas for the movie represent things we have seen Allen do in his own work, such as use black & white photography to glorious effect in ""Manhattan,"" so ""Hollywood Ending"" is definitely a film for someone well versed in Allen's career and not a casual viewer who mostly enjoyed his early, funny films.
I was just disappointed that the blind director bit did not have more of a payoff (in that regard you see almost all of the good stuff from the trailer).  Most of the good one-liners in this movie are about the film industry and not the blindness of the main character (e.g., Val is told that someone ""has made some very financially successful American films,"" and shoots back, ""That should tell you everything you need to know about him"").  Perhaps the problem was that I was thinking back to ""Crimes & Misdemeanors,"" where Allen touched on the subject of blindness in a poignant and purposeful way.  But that is not his intent here, where the emphasis is clearly on shtick over pathos.

I usually like Woody Allen's movies - especially his more serious films such as Hannah and her sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and even Mighty Aphrodite. However, ""a Hollywood Ending"" is not a movie I will recommend. The story starts as rather promising when a once famous director played by Allen is given a promising directing job. This job comes to him when he is at the bottom of his career and thus he has no option but to take the offer even if it comes from his ex-wife and her new lover (whom he detests). At this stage of the movie Woody Allen is as neurotic as ever but the dialogues are witty and interesting. I was now expecting to see something about movie filming on the whole and something about the director's struggle to make the film when his ex-wife is in the neighborhood.  However, the director, our hero, suddenly turns psychologically blind and this not-so-funny gimmick is stretched throughout the whole film. The director has no choice but to hide his blindness and thus directs the movie without being able to see what he does, with endless seemingly ""funny"" situations where this gimmick is used over and over again (a gossip reporter spying around, the young actress invites the blind director to her room, the scenes are not properly filmed, etc. etc).  The whole situation did not seem comic to me and I could not understand the pride over spending the studio's 50 million dollars.
This movie seems to be such a waste as the story begins quite well and could have been really interesting. Tia Leoni is beautiful and her performance seems to save this movie from being totally boring. No other actor has left any impression on me.  Very disappointing.",1054598400,3,1700,4.717171717171717

I've loved or really, really liked almost every film I've seen from him (even his voice-over in Antz was great) but this film should've been cut by about an hour.  It starts out in the usual Woody humor and the characters that you get to meet are just as genuine and believable as Woody makes them.  He's a struggling movie director who had a vivid career years ago and he's now being offered the film of a lifetime by a film studio overrun by his ex-wife and the man she left him for.  Thinking that the film will actually be more about the relationship and the struggle of their marriage, it instead takes the gag of him thinking that he's blind and runs it into the ground.  Eventually it becomes as nerve racking as a car alarm outside your door and no one has the key remote to turn it off.  By the time you've reached the last 20 minutes of the film, you've waived your right to laugh anymore as the joke just isn't funny anymore and his dilemma is no longer cute, laughable and just becomes, well, stupid.  It's a shame that the film itself seemingly dictates this film.  In the movie he's directing a film totally blind due to a psychosematic episode just days before shooting and tries his best to hide the truth of his illness so not to blow one of the best deals of his life.  You could almost say the same about this movie as he's totally blind to the fact that this joke will eventually get old and because it personafies the entire film you wonder if he wasn't making a joke on himself on this movie.  Like he wanted to make a movie that would flop so he decided to make a movie about a film flopping and how it could happen.
By the films closing moments everything begins to take shape and you're forced to accept the end in the time alloted.  But frankly you feel cheated that he didn't spend more time on the relationship between him and his ex-wife and not focus so much on this blindness that is quickly forgotten how and why it even happened.  After nearly an hour I was almost screaming at the television asking Woody to snap out of it and get his sight back.
Also, some of the co-stars like George Hamilton and Tiffani Thiessen weren't as necessary to the story as you wanted.  In the case of Tiffani, she basically showed up just to be a Hollywood ... with no other interaction with Woody or any of the other characters in the film.  Her role was not only shallow but seemed to only be there to support the T&A quota of the film.  Other than that, her role was not needed and actually disappoints as you want to see Woody make out with Tiffani but instead he fumbles around in his blind state making the overall scene more frustration than funny.
Overall, the film begins to just become an extreme exercise in just sitting through a seemingly endless one-liner that gets old after the first 30 minutes and just mind-numbing after nearly an hour of the same gag.
I would say rent this first before buying it as sitting through it again could be worse than actually paying for the DVD.",1039564800,5,3183,4.35304054054054

Cary Grant was having problems pulling this off when he was in his 60s, Allen's age, and Woody Allen has never been a romantic leading man the likes of Cary Grant. Plus picking as a rival the urbane and handsome Williams further widens the credibility gap.  Allen really needs to abandon playing these roles and hire someone else to do it and place himself squarely behind the camera.  If he wishes to cast himself in a non-romantic role or (horror of horrors) a romance vehicle with someone nearer to his own age, then he can step in front of the camera once again.

What is especially distressing is that he is still as fine a writer and director as can be found in the film world.  He is squandering that talent promoting himself as a romantic leading man. If he'd gotten rid of the romance angle, there is a genuinely funny idea here which could have been exploited for laughs.  This is that he has a film director make an entire movie while suffering from psychosomatic blindness and no one guesses because the other film people are so ""blind"" in turn to the eccentricities of a brilliant, renowned film director.  If Allen had run with this idea and gotten rid of his love interests, it could have been hilarious.

It is meant to be light, diverting entertainment and on that account it succeeds marvelously.",1034294400,9,352,5.25
1494261,1,B00005JL81,"Real Woody Allen fans will rejoice with this film; at least they better, because nobody else will.  Decidedly, this one is for dyed-in-the-wool Woody fans only, and it goes far in demonstrating that even an inspired concept or idea does not necessarily a good movie make.  And whether you look at it entirely objectively or from a subjective viewpoint, ""Hollywood Ending,"" written, directed by and starring Woody Allen, is a clinker.  It's an interesting notion that came to fruition as a one-note, one-joke film that, ironically, is as bad as the film made within the film.  Maybe even worse.  On the positive side of the coin, the best thing that can be said about it is that it's not quite as dismal as the Woodman's misfire, ""Celebrity,"" inasmuch as no one here attempts a grating Woody Allen impersonation a la Kenneth Branagh, which was THE most unnerving aspect of THAT whole debacle.
The story is fairly straightforward and simple:  Legendary director Val Waxman (Allen) has fallen on hard times, mainly due to his own obstinate attitude, and he's been reduced to directing a television commercial on location in Canada.  He finds a champion, however, in his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now engaged to Galaxie Studios boss, Hal (Treat Williams), to whom she pitches Val as the perfect director for their latest project.  After much to-do and some initial skepticism (based on his history with Val), Hal gives in and gives the green light to hire Val.
When Val gets the news he is by turns surprised and elated; so much so, that just as they are starting production on the picture, Val is struck with psychosomatic blindness, which could possibly (?) impede his ability to direct a motion picture.  But this is the chance for a comeback that Val has been waiting for, so he dares not reveal his problem, especially to Hal.  And so, after necessarily confiding his dilemma to a carefully selected couple of people, Val goes on with a little help from his friends.  Now, if he can only keep Hal away from the dailies, he has a chance to finish the film; the film he was ""destined"" to make.
Without question, this film definitely has it's moments, and some of them are actually hilarious; but it's simply not enough to sustain interest or make this one memorable in any way.  As previously stated, the concept is good; one may even say inspired.  But the execution goes devastatingly awry.  The dialogue is well written (which combined with the right visuals inspires the laughs), but the story is filled with Hollywood ""in"" jokes, most of which will mean little, if anything to an unsuspecting audience.  And in most cases, even if you do ""get"" it, it's just not that funny.  Add to that the fact that this is arguably the ""shallowest"" film Allen has ever made, and you begin to realize why this one just doesn't resonate.  The intelligence, depth and insights that define most of Allen's films are inexplicably absent here, and the impact on the final product is quite noticeable.  And it just goes to show that even a filmmaker like Woody Allen, who is often brilliant and sometimes genius, can occasionally miss the mark.  And, as is the case here, miss it altogether.
As an actor, Woody Allen has created some characters who are likable to a degree, but never endearing; he can be interesting, but his natural lack of charisma renders him less than riveting; he can even be sympathetic, but it's rare.  As Val, he is none of the above, which is one of the inherent problems with this movie.  Val is a guy you are hard put to tolerate, let alone like, and as such you just won't care much one way or another if he succeeds or not.  Most likely, you'll be hoping he winds back up in Canada, freezing along with his insecurities and incorrigible attitude.  Perhaps the time has come for Allen to rethink the role he should play in his own films.  In ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" he successfully opted to cast John Cusack in the ""Woody"" part, and it seemed that he had turned some kind of artistic corner with regards to his own ego; but playing Val himself is a big case of backsliding.  Even Paul Newman realizes he isn't ""Hud"" anymore; it's time Woody realized that he isn't...well...whatever he was at one time.
The beautiful and talented Tea Leoni gives a worthy performance as Ellie-- in fact, one could say her participation is the highlight of the film.  It's tough to buy Leoni and Allen as a couple, though; It's just hard to accept that Val and Ellie were ever married.  She seems much more suited to a David Duchovny type.  For all her efforts, even suspending disbelief doesn't make the relationship seem viable, which, of course, has an impact on the film's credibility.
Still, it's even harder to believe Debra Messing as Lori, Val's ""current"" girlfriend.  Her performance is convincing, but the relationship is just too questionable.  And this isn't judging a book by it's cover; looks aside, with what we know about Val, you have to wonder what could possibly attract Lori to him.  The angle that as an aspiring actor she's using him to get her foot in the door doesn't hold water, inasmuch as he's on the way down and there is a plethora of others in positions of power who would be ready and able to add the willing Lori to their personal cast of characters.  It simply doesn't jibe with the reality of the situation.
The supporting cast includes Bob Dorian (Galaxie Exec.), Mark Rydell (Al), Yu Lu (Cameraman), Barney Cheng (Translator), Isaac Mizrahi (Elio), Marian Seldes (Alexandra) and George Hamilton (Ed).  To those who subjectively translate anything Woody Allen does to perfection, ""Hollywood Ending"" will be a satisfying experience.  Those who fall outside of that parameter, however, will be disappointed.  Either way, it's the magic of the movies.",1033603200,9,5779,4.7507507507507505

Without resorting to placing 30 year old actors back in college, or relying on cheap gross-out gags involving animals, invalids, bare breasts or bodily fluids, he has written, once again, a smart, witty and enduring popular movie. Those critics who should know better will doubtless continue to chastise him for growing older, and retaining a distinctive style, and not selling out to some dubious money-spinning fashion, and then in a decade or so they will of course generously rediscover and ""re-evaluate"" these works in a more mature and positive fashion. Everyone else, however - the grown-ups - can simply watch this and other Allen movies now, and celebrate the man's talent, invention, intelligence and remarkable consistency.",1033430400,11,997,5.356687898089172

Tea Leoni has a difficult role as his former wife, who in the process of steering him safely through directing a Hollywood megabudget hit, finds her love for him resurrected.

  The boneheaded plot device of Allen psychosomatically losing his sight is not well done.  He consistently turns his head away from those speaking. Would he not hear the direction of their voices?

1494344,3,B00005JL81,"...since I've seen a Woody Allen movie. In fact, I hadn't even heard Woody Allen's VOICE for years until there he was at the Academy Awards this year, introducing that salute to New York City. It was then a strange feeling, rather like hearing the dead. Not a resurrection, mind you; just like hearing the voice of someone who has died on a tape recorder or something. Of course, this was because of the Soon Yi thing. Like many others, I took the oath: no more Woody, that creep. But when I saw him again on the Oscars and had that strange feeling, I said to myself, ""Well, why wait until he is dead, why don't you go see another movie by him?"" So this one was at the local theatre, and there I found myself.
And, now seeing one of these movies again after years, it struck me as from another era, even though it's spanking new. The camera angles are more static and the direction much slower and really of a different time; today there's just so much cutting and fancy work, what with all the advances in special effects. During the first prolonged scene when the ex-wife is convincing Treat Williams and George Hamilton to hire the absent Woody to direct an expensive movie, I thought I was watching a movie made in the dinosaur age, or at least a few decades ago. I got over it, though, and began to take the movie for what it was.
Woody is about as I remember him: a neurotic man hasn't gotten over the woman who left him, and now is going to bungle things, pretty much like he did last time to cause the woman to leave in the first place. He's a film director who pyschosomatically gets struck blind on the first day of shooting the new come-back movie. His agent gets a young Chinese guy to serve as Woody's eyes, and we're off to comic complications.
I thought the ex-wife was miscast, only because she seemed too young to have been divorced from Woody for ten years and to have been married to him for ten years before that. She should've been much closer to 50 than this babe kind of woman. Don't get me wrong, she was a good actress and pretty, but just too young for the scenario presented us. Mark Rydell as the agent/conspirator was especially good, probably the best in show. Nothing wrong with Treat and Hamilton, but nothing mind blowing either.
""Hollywood Ending"" was an enjoyable night at the movies for me, and a bit of a trip down memory lane, seeing Woody and remembering the pre-scandal days. Not a classic, but entertaining.",1024617600,4,2448,4.418141592920354
1494345,3,B00005JL81,"Liek many baby boomers and other moviegoers, I grew up watching Woody Allen.  From his earliest days as a guest on nightly talk shows to his first movies like Bananas and Play it Again Sam, I have been a loyal and devoted fan.  Just the announcement of a new Woody Allen movie in production finds me rushing to rewatch old favorite movies of his like Radio Days, Hannah and her Sisters and the incomprable Crimes and Misdemeanors.
But that said, in anticipation of seeing his latest film, Hollywood Ending, I was a bit reluctant and gun shy.  Perhaps it was because the reviews for this movie were rather mediocre, although reviews seldom if ever bother me. Or perhaps it was because Woody Allen's current movies seem to repeat many of his earlier schtick.  But I think what really had me hesitating was the failure of Allen's last movie, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, to deliver any of the laughs or humor which I associate with Mr. Allen's movies.  But I put those thoughts aside and hoped for the best. Now that I've seen Hollywood Ending and will admit it was better than the The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, it still failed to entertain me with the kinds of laughs found in Annie Hall, the nostalgia found in Radio Days or the pathos found in Crimes and Misdemeanors.
Assmebling a fine cast which includes Tea Leoni as Mr. Allens ex-wife, Treat Williams as a Beverly Hills producer and Ms. Leonis current husband and the ever tan and handsome Goerge Hamitlon as the studio executive, it is as if Woody Allen has borrowed lines and laughs from his former movies.  Some work, some don't but the themes of lost loves, selling out, creative art vs. money maling endeavors, psychosomatic illnesses, neurosis and betrayals are just not new and invigorating in this this film.
One might say that even a so-so Woody Allen movie is better than most films today. If thats so, stay home and rent his masterpiece movies and revel in the way he was.",1024531200,9,1942,4.598265895953757

(***1/2)
out of ****
Rated PG-13
 Each year audiences are treated with a visit from something from another time, a nostalgic piece of comic heaven.  Last year it was the mediocre ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" this year it is the full-blown genuine comedy ""Hollywood Ending"".  I hadn't laughed so hard and so genuine since ""Annie Hall"", Woody Allen's 1977 masterpiece.  ""Hollywood Ending"" is no masterpiece, but if you're a lover of true comic timing and the styling of such comedians as Charlie Chaplin, Groucho Marx and Bob Hope, you will not only love this film, but you will, inevitably, love Woody Allen.
 I attended this film on opening night, May 3rd, in Lawrence, Kansas, for Topeka Kansas seems to be more focused on block-busting adventures such as ""Spider-Man.""  I went to see it with three Woody Allen fans, two of them long- time fans (one them told me their first affair with Woody Allen in seventh grade when they saw ""What's New Pussycat"") and one barely over a year old. Yet, all of us were giddy with excitement at what we were about to be presented with.
 ""Hollywood Ending"" tells the story of Val Waxman (Woody Allen) a hypochondriac artistic filmmaker who, although in the 70's and 80's won Oscars, is now filming deodorant commercials in Canada.  His ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), who left him for studio executive Hal Yeager (Treat Williams), has gotten him a job shooting a remake of the 1953 film noir ""The City That Never Sleeps."" But days before shooting begins Val goes psychosomatically blind, and his agent, Al (Mark Rydell) tries to cover it up, creating surreal comedy.
 The premise is simple, and goofy, yet Allen's intellectual sense of humor will keep people whose vocabulary does not consist of ""morose"" out of the theatre.  Allen's films aren't made for a wide audience; they're made for the people who truly love this type of humor.  In one scene in which Val is trying to cover up that he is blind while he is having a meeting with Hal Yeager, he prances around the screen like Charlie Chaplin. I have to say I haven't seen Woody this physical since his 1973 ode to silent film, ""Sleeper."" Allen's films always parallel situations in his real life.  Like the fact that he always likes to hire foreign cinematographers, or that he wants to shoot the film entirely in black and white, or that the only place to shoot it is in the streets of New York City.  In this film Woody makes New York brilliantly beautiful and once again portrays his love affair with the city.
 The performances were wonderful as well.  Woody Allen has never been so anxious and nervous, his nervous tics radiate the screen and energize the audience.  And he hasn't had a leading lady that has done so much for the film like Tea Leoni does since, perhaps, Diane Keaton.  Barney Cheng stars as the translator for the Chinese cinematographer in the first half of the film, and when paired with Allen's character is was comic heaven.  I was impressed by Debra Messing and her stomach, along with her dizty, yet truthfully, comedic performance as Val's live-in girlfriend.  Though, as I have stated, some performances were top-notch, other's slightly above mediocre.  Treat Williams' performance was nothing amazing, neither was Tiffany Thiessen (remember Kelly from ""Saved by The Bell""?) and George Hamilton just stood there with his golf club and played what he plays best...himself...The Tan Man.
 Woody Allen is still the master of comedy, and, from what I can see, is the only one around still doing this kind of stuff.  From his introspective films of the eighties (""Hannah and Her Sisters"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"") to his mirth filled comedies of the mid-nineties (""Mighty Aphrodite"" ""Everyone Says I Love You"") to his more hard-edged, cynical films of the late-nineties (""Deconstructing Harry"" ""Celebrity""), Allen has proved with this film, and his last two (""Small Time Crooks"", ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion) that he still has that perfect comic timing he had twenty-five years ago.  This was an amazing film with a wonderful ending that will have you chuckling days after you leave the theatre.
 And if you didn't have faith in the Woodman, he's already working on his next film, shooting will begin May 13th in New York City.  His new film stars Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Jason Biggs, Jimmy Fallon, Christina Ricci and, of course, Woody Allen.
 So viewers...enjoy.",1022630400,4,4402,4.851604278074866

1494350,4,B00005JL81,"It is odd that reviewers of ""Hollywood Ending,"" Woody Allen's most recent film, should have remarked on elements hard to accept, on its anti-Hollywood/successful film stance, and its surprise pro-Europe conclusion, without adding up these elements and finding the total: Fellini.  The hint is clear from the start, a director who is unable to make the film!  Shades of ""8 1/2""!  Moreover both directors (Guido is Fellini's, played of course by Marcello Mastroianni) have an ex-wife (estranged or divorced) portrayed with ""feminine charms"" minimized (Fellini made Anouk Aimee cut her hair short and wear heavy rimmed glasses).  Each wife re-enters her husband's life at a crucial, challenged  moment of his creativity.  Both men have a ""companion"" (""mistress"" seems more appropriate for 1962) who is in or near the set.  Both men feel their film threatened by critics and potential reviewers, both are reminded frequently of the high cost of their film folly, neither ""has a script"" in the sense of knowing where the film is going.  Guido in ""8 1/2"" has more personal history, but Fellini clearly conveys the idea of the crippling effect of ""blindness"" to others, and the need to be open to, and accepting of, ALL that one has experienced in life; Allen's film limits this reconciliation with one's experience to the wayward son.  In both cases the contents of the film-to-be-made are rigourously excluded, though in both the audience gets a glimpse...a spaceship in one, a family quarrel in the other.  To take this film as ""right from life,"" New York's or Allen's, robs it of wonderful resonances.  There  is also, I'd suggest, a reminiscence of ""After the Fox,"" where the Peter Sellers character also makes a movie without a plot....",1021161600,2,1735,5.049122807017544

Woody's portrayl of a blind person may be exaggerated to the nth degree, but I think it was appropriate of a person who desperatley needs his sight back, and is lost without his most important sense.
The ending of the movie is horrid, which may be why the movie's title is so.  It is too perfect, too fast.  That, or they just ran out of time and threw something together, and then added the title.

How'd you like that said about you? What would you do? Woody Allen seems to have made a movie about all the above and cast himself as the washed-up director whose best films are behind him AND he is contracted to make a movie set in NY, the very center of his existence.

I liked it. There are some very witty lines (""How can I make a movie if I'm blind?"" ""Have you seen some recent movies???"") I absolutely LOVE the way NYC is seen in the background through big glass windows or at Central Park -- the City radiates. So do the actors. Tea Leoni is gorgeous to look at. Treat Williams, never more handsome -- and what about George Hamilton??? Their acting was believable. I was very impressed with Mr. Allen's attention to detail -- look for the beautiful, octogenarian, model, Carmen, sitting behind him in a restaurant scene, or how Debra Messing's exercise-fanatic girlfriend character wears ankle weights with high heels.

You can go pay $11 to see any new mediocre released movie or you can buy a Woody Allen movie from an Amazon Seller in the Used category and get a better deal and better entertainment. I will watch this again. I will lend it to friends. I will recommend it -- that's how much I liked it.",1359936000,,1430,4.429657794676806
7940034,5,B00005JL81,Another great Woody movie... commenting on all types of things in society... all through his great sense of humor and irony. This was only my 2nd viewing and I totally forgot what a GREAT performance Tea Leoni did.  Worth seeing again for her acting skills.,1357776000,,257,4.711111111111111
