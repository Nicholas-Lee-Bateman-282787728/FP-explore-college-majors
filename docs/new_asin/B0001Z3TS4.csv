2044009,3,B0001Z3TS4,"I really wanted to like this movie, and it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would. The biggest problem I have with ""Sherlock Holmes"" is that it isn't the clever, witty, intellectual detective comedy I thought it was going to be. In fact, it really wasn't much of a detective movie at all. Instead, it's more of a guy-oriented, buddy-cop action movie disguised as something else. Don't get me wrong: it's great for what it is. I was just expecting more. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are hilarious as Holmes and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, but I would have enjoyed seeing more clever banter between these two instead of just one fight sequence after another. Rachel McAdams has a supporting role in the film, but I didn't enjoy her part at all. I think that was more the fault of the script than the actress, since I always enjoy McAdams in movies. Overall, I didn't really like the plot of the film, and I thought the story was kind of choppy throughout. I just expected more from this movie than I got.",1261699200,6,1031,4.403141361256544
2044010,5,B0001Z3TS4,"My apologies to Harry Eagar and his scathing review, but he must have seen a different SHERLOCK HOLMES than I did.

I'll say this: This isn't your Grandmother's Sherlock Holmes. No plodding Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce plot pacing here. This is very definitely a 21st Century reimagining of Holmes. I suppose purists might dislike it, but I've never cared for the snoringly slow interpretations of most prior performers.

Robert Downey Jr., by now the 214th person to play Holmes, brings him to life with a curious admixture of brilliance and slovenliness that nevertheless manages to capture the true essence of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's consulting detective with panache.

When we first see Holmes he has eremetically sealed himself in his room and is distracting his bored mind by inventing a gunpowder neutralizer. Bullet holes scar the walls. ""It isn't working,"" he laments to Dr. Watson (Jude Law) his sidekick, who is in the process of moving out and into happy domesticity with his wife-to-be.

Holmes' most recent case has put the nefarious Lord Blackwood, a black magician, onto Death Row. After his hanging, he somehow resurrects himself, and his killing spree begins anew. The panicked authorities turn to Holmes.

Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Mistress of All Criminals and Holmes' former lover, is put up to distracting Holmes, but nothing distracts him when the game is afoot.

This is a very action-packed movie. Holmes is adept with weapons, with techniques of unarmed combat, and in creating all kinds of havoc in the London of the 1880s. Like most action movies of our time SHERLOCK HOLMES tries to out-do itself with inventive disasters, massive explosions, and rapid-fire plot twists. To be honest, I find most movies of this genre hyperactive, but this film's solid grounding as a ""period piece"" tends to keep it well rooted, and it is inventive. It never flies out of control as (for example)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B0002KVUKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>&nbsp;did.

SHERLOCK HOLMES does sample Johnny Depp's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Hell/dp/B00006JDU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Hell</a>&nbsp;just a shade too much, but part of that is unavoidable as both took place at literally the same time in the same setting. Less forgivable is this film's nod to Vin Diesel in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XXX/dp/B00005JL3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XXX</a>.

Given the richness of the Holmes canon, some of the derivatives here were just not necessary. Other than that, I strongly suggest we all make Robert Downey Jr. OUR Sherlock Holmes. And you may well ask, ""Where is Professor Moriarity?""

Where indeed?  ;)",1261699200,5,2812,5.870098039215686
2044011,4,B0001Z3TS4,"In late Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey) and Watson (Jude Law) are once again up against a criminal mastermind that confounds the well-meaning but limited scope of Scotland Yard.  In this edition an aristocratic black magic practitioner, Lord Blackwood, is confounded in the middle of a human sacrifice by Holmes. Blackwood is hanged and pronounced dead by Watson but is seen roaming the graveyard after his death. Meanwhile, Holmes encounters ""the woman"" Irene Adler, who engages him to find a missing person. Watson is moving out in order to build a home for his prospective wife and is trying to pull back from his almost symbiotic link with Holmes. Holmes is having difficulty adjusting to the loss of his faithful sidekick and as the Blackwood/Adler case become more dangerous, Watson is sucked back in to assist Holmes in saving the day.

Downey performs Holmes masterfully, with the required panache, charisma and eccentric genius. He and Law have a marvelous chemistry which is mandatory for any Holmes/Watson actor team, and Downey keeps up with Law's native English accent with apparent ease.  There is plenty of humorous repartee between them which blends nicely with Holmes talents and detective skill. Eddie Marson completes the team as the always clueless Inspector Lestrade.

In this film meticulous care is taken to capture the grime and excitement of London in this early industrial period, where the enormous Tower Bridge is under construction and the Thames is filled with traffic. Scenes are filmed on location, transforming modern London into a beautiful gothic fantasy. The muddy streets and houses smeared with soot are faithfully rendered taking the viewer into a different world. Other scenes utilize beautiful period interiors that convey the elegance of the period, and sets that reflect the poverty of the period.

Guy Ritchie (recently divorced from Madonna) masterfully directs this gorgeous film. He is best known for his take on modern English gangster culture in films such as Snatch. He has fulfilled the promise of his earlier films, maintains the rapid-fire pace, and has developed a stunning aesthetic lavishly portrayed in this film.

This is a wonderful holiday film filled with action, suspense, humor and mystery. A must-see for Holmes fans!",1261699200,5,2299,5.2506811989100814
2044012,1,B0001Z3TS4,"Seldom have I seen a movie whose grasp was so much less than its reach.

This was shown at the Maui Film Festival's First Light on Dec. 23, and MFF's Barry Rivers said it was the first showing in North America. Be warned. It's coming to a theater near you.

First, at least a third of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and not only because of the London accents. Sherlock, especially, mumbles.

Whoever wrote this script either failed to get Sherlock Holmes or was deliberately standing Doyle on his head. Although in the Strand stories, Holmes occasionally displays a surprising strength, he uses his head, not his fists, to get results. Likewise, Watson is occasionally advised to ""bring your pistol,"" but as far as I can recollect, he never shoots it.

The authors show a considerable knowledge of the Holmes canon but no understanding of it (unless they are being intentionally perverse for mysterious reasons). ""Across the Universe"" two years ago showed what creative people could do by reworking the complete canon of other creative people. ""Sherlock Holmes"" shows how people without any creative imagination can take a high canon and rework it as a Saturday morning cartoon,

Third, director Guy Ritchie cut this like a music video, and not a good one, either. It was akin to watching a waterbug on crack.

The only good thing I can find to say about this flick is that Rachel McAdams has very nice lips.",1261699200,28,1411,4.809917355371901

So wasn't ""The French Interpreter"" but that's not in this set.  Ronald Howard played Holmes in a likeable way, while H. Marion Crawford was an excellent Watson, and both are closer to the ages Holmes and Watson really were when they first met.  The prints could be cleaner, but they're better than what's turned up on local TV stations and come in a nice package.  Let's hope they put out the remaining episodes to complete the series.

2044017,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Watching the first 5 minutes of this film, I was thinking ""Well this might be interesting and quite entertaining"", a new take on the Holmes character and all that.  However, it didn't pan out that way. I actually became bored fairly quickly.  It was just too over-the-top, too much of the time.  It became tiresome.  During that first 5 minutes, I envisioned that they were going to introduce a Holmes who was still very steady and intellectual and very dignified, yet could elegantly kick ass when necessary.  I thought they were just going to subtly add this dimension to the character while still retaining the qualities that made the character so popular to begin with.  Wrong.  What they did was basically rewrite the entire personality of Holmes.  In this film, he is totally bereft of elegance and dignity.  He's more like The Nutty Professor, so eccentric he can scarcely take care of himself, looking befuddled and goofy most of the time.  Instead of adding an element to the character, they stripped him of virtually every facet of his personality which makes him so appealing.  No suavity, no slyly sardonic humor, no sense of the seriousness with which he normally views his vocation.  Just a boisterous, cartoonish idiot savant.

The sets were good.  The writing decent though the overall storyline was rather weak and unimaginative.  The editing was awkward in several spots.  It's like they put all their eggs into the basket of action, action, ACTION! and everything else was secondary--just enough to hopefully hold it together, which it didn't.  I got the feeling all the ""calm"" scenes were just forced filler until the next action, action, ACTION! scene.  If you are a fan of ""super hero""-type movies, and NOT a fan of Sherlock Holmes, you might enjoy this movie.

I have to wonder what's next--a new Hercule Poirot franchise?  Perhaps they could call it ""Belgian Fury"":  ""When Poirot (Jason Statham) discovers Captain Hastings (Tom Hardy) has been taken hostage by a gang of international gun runners, he becomes a one-man wrecking ball in his determination to rescue his friend.

2044040,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Review of Sherlock Holmes
Hot Toasty Rag, December 12, 2017

While there have been countless film and television portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson, the whodunnit genre is never one that audiences tire of, so why not continue to make them? Robert Downey Jr. stars as the famed literary detective, with Jude Law at his side. When I first heard of this films production, I learned the cast and thought, Oh, Jude Law will make a great Sherlock Holmes! But, as is sometimes the case, Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinbergs script wrote Holmes to be the eccentric one with Watson as the straight man. Thus, Jude Law took second billing and saved his talent for later.

Robert Downey Jr. already proved his flawless British accent in Chaplin, so its no stretch to see him blend into his surroundings. However, hes one of those love-him-or-leave-him actors, and this movie probably won't change the opinion you already have of him. If you think hes talented, handsome, and funny, youll like Sherlock Holmes. If you think hes overrated and emits an ego larger than his talent, you won't like it.

Director Guy Ritchie added an extra technical difference to his film, one thats also a love-it-or-leave-it feature. In the many action scenes throughout the filmthis isn't a wordy mystery, its an action-comedythe footage is slowed down at random moments, showing details that would normally be impossible to spot. Someone throws a punch, and the camera shows the ripple of skin when contact is made, the expectorate from the injured mans mouth, and the low groan of pain to coincide with the slowed down footage. I found it a little too modern and jarring; I would have preferred every aspect to fit with the time period.",1513036800,,1755,4.882550335570469

2044117,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes, 2009 film

The film begins on a cobblestone road. Horses draw carriages. A man with a lantern is attacked in the dark. We see a weird ceremony being held over a young woman (like some porno-horror movie). Can she be rescued? Lord Blackwood is unmasked. Inspector Lestrade arrives with his Bobbies to arrest the gang. Next we see Baker Street. Watson plans to move out, Holmes is bored at home. They dine out, Holmes meets Mary Morstan (who needs no introduction). Holmes gets a glass of wine. Next we see a bare-knuckle fight in a pit. Holmes fights a bigger and heavier opponent, and wins. We see a dark and dirty London. Holmes wears no hat! Blackwood makes a prediction: three more. Holmes gets a visit from Irene Adler, she has a request. Holmes has a trick here. Inspector Lestrade summons Holmes about Blackwood! Dr. Watson is involved too. Blackwood's coffin is opened, there is a surprise! [How did it happen?] They enter an apartment to search for clues. There is drama and entertainment. [What, no revolver?]

There is a chase for action in a shipyard. Lestrade wants Holmes to see a High Official who wants to stop Blackwood from doing evil. Holmes visits Irene Adler and opens a bottle of wine. After he is rescued, he visits the rooms of that High Official. Sir Thomas is dead. There is a meeting. Blackwood plans for a New World Order. He can't be stopped! These important people control the police. Holmes and Watson explore the shore. They find a slaughterhouse and rescue a woman. There is a trap! The story continues. Can Holmes defeat the villainous Blackwood? Holmes uses symbolism to foretell Blackwood's plans. Is there a plot to attack Parliament for a coup d'etat? Holmes deduces that a poison gas will be used to kill Parliament. Can they overpower the villains and stop the infernal machine? [You know the answer.] There is a final struggle high over the river. Holmes explains how the magic tricks were done by Blackwood. The villain falls from his heights, like Lucifer. Irene Adler survived to tell about the Professor. ""We'll see about that."" Then a Bobbie brings news of a murder, and Holmes has a new case.

Do you remember those Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1940s? This is a modern version with a bigger budget but not a better story. Its more complex than those simpler monochrome movies. You can see the special effects of CGI, they are not overdone. This story is different from Doyle's writings, and overlong. Aside from the scenery, this could have been a ""James Bond"" adventure story where the world is saved from a powerful madman.",1487635200,,2591,4.753333333333333

There's a whole Internet full of websites dedicated to beautiful women, often called pornography. I was trying to watch a movie about two intelligent men with character. Instead, I got a movie about some losers trying to deal with women. Damsels in distress, wearing sexy outfits.

It also is more faithful to Doyle's world-famous character than many more ""serious"" adaptions. Holmes really was an inconsiderate, moody, over-dramatic, reclusive, impulsive man.

I quickly bought this one and it was just as good. Very sassy, clever dialog, good ensemble cast and action sequence is very well-done. What I like the most is the set design and ambiance that really conveyed the sense of mystery, fun and mischief of the turn-of-the-century London. Most Hollywood pics nowadays follows the tired old formulas, but Guy Richie's modern take breath new life into this well-known classic.

Robert Downey, Jr. brings his own take on the character to the movies and it is replete with humor and class.  Jude Law is perfect as Watson.  Good fun, lots of action and, of course, Moriarty.

Though I'm a HUGE fan of RDJ, I wasn't 100% convinced that he could pull off Sherlock to the way that most Holmes fans would like. As usual, he went above and beyond and absolutely nailed the role, officially spoiling me for anyone else (other that BC in the series) to play Sherlock. The story itself was incredibly well written and presented, the cast was amazing; it did not disappoint at all! I would highly recommend this movie as its also safe for the family to watch as well.

2044336,1,B0001Z3TS4,"This movie was sadly unimpressive. While I enjoyed the production design and the elaborate costuming, the story left much to be desired. The plot was complicated and the story dragged along in a jerky fashion. The action scenes were entertaining, but had little or nothing to do with the actual plotline. I also disliked the character portrayals of Holmes and Watson. RDJ's Holmes is very difficult to stomach most of the time and Jude Law's Watson is every bit as arrogant as Holmes. In fact, most of the movie focuses on Watson's heroics and fighting skills rather than on the title character's exploits. In trying to modernize the Sherlock Holmes story, the writers seem to have lost all the charm and cleverness of the original stories.",1454544000,,740,4.880952380952381

Just horrible and hard to follow...and I have been around Brits so I can attest to this. That being said, we are Sherlock Holmes fans both in the written and film forms so we faithfully slugged through and waited this one out. Jude Law is the perfect foil to Holmes and does his part to the max in order to help the story through. All in all, if you are a Holmes fan, since it is a Holmes story...watch it but don't have high expectations. Downey was the wrong man for the job here.",1454544000,,644,4.286885245901639

2044401,4,B0001Z3TS4,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...

Sherlock Holmes (2009) stars Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, and Eddie Marsan.  This movie has a lot of action and darkness throughout.  The fight sequence near the beginning comes off as a little awkward with the film being sped up, etc., but it's definitely a unique sequence.  The acting throughout is good, especially by Downey.  The musical score by Hans Zimmer is pretty good.  The CGI was done well, with the exception of some scenes that looked quite fake.  The DVD comes with Special Features, including a feature called Sherlock Holmes: Reinvented.

This movie is clearly a different spin on the Sherlock Holmes story and character.  He seems way more active than he normally would be and I feel that this was done deliberately to satisfy today's audience who expect and want everything to be high octane or they'll get bored.  This is Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century.

Worth a look.

2044414,5,B0001Z3TS4,"The movie Sherlock Holmes is about a legendary detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his crime-solving partner, Dr. Watson (Jude Law). Sherlock gained his reputation by finding the truth of the most complex mysteries with the help of his partner Dr. Watson (Jude Law). After a chain of ruthless cold-blooded murders that have terrorized London, Holmes and Watson arrive just in time to save the latest victim and uncover the killer; Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). As Lord Blackwood approaches his scheduled hanging, Blackwood warns Holmes that death has no power over him and, in fact, his execution plays right into Blackwood's plans. And when, by all indications, Blackwood makes good on his promise, his apparent resurrection panics London and confounds Scotland Yard. But to Holmes, the game is afoot.

The character Sherlock Holmes is what I believe what most people want to be like. He is strong, smart, and always catching the bad guys. Although he is a character that is artistically temperamental and manic depressive, he is a physically powerful individual who constantly annoyed Watson by conducting experiments in their shared flat. I strongly suggest you watch the movie. The movie isn't a low-budget one. Theres a lot of effort put into it, and it has amazing graphic design in it, making it really interesting to watch. The acting is magnificent on its own, but with the amazing graphic design, it made it even better. Plus, I enjoy watching Robert Downey Jr.s acting. Both Robert Downey Jr. played and Jude Law did a fantastic job at playing their characters. On top of that, the presumed dark arts or dark magic that Lord Blackwood has made me think that dark arts or dark magic existed in that world. But then it was proved wrong by Sherlock Holmes and proved that it was all science made the movie even better and much more realistic. The movie was set to the Victorian period which I like because you can see that science was just starting to grow in that age. I also like the Victorian era because how people dress. You can distinguish between the poor and the rich by what they're wearing.",1440979200,,2122,4.861878453038674

2044425,5,B0001Z3TS4,"More true to the pretentious, self-absorbed, drug-addicted, and exceptional investigative mind of the original books, Downey's Sherlock Holmes character is simultaneously thoroughly appreciable and throughly reprehensible. When a superior adversary plays on the fears and superstitions of average people, in order to realize a truly megalomaniacal objective, Sherlock is the only one sufficiently intelligent and sufficient crazy enough, to solve the plot. Sherlock's madness, obsession with Dr. Watson (possibly the only ""friend"" he's had in his entire life), and willingness to look far beyond common perceptions of what constitutes reality, allow him, along with his oddly talented physical prowess, to win the day, for Great Britain, and for the common good. Some of the more interesting elements involve a thoroughly talented, yet entirely criminal, fem fatale (whom Sherlock thoroughly lusts after and / or loves) and Sherlock's ability to rapidly access physical weaknesses of combatants whom he is up against (ingenuously captured by Guy Ritchie, in brief, Sherlock-narrated summaries of his brain's thoughts, the likes of which we can see are instantly postulated in Sherlock's mind, allowing him to overwhelm any opponent, in a fight, played in slow motion, then executed in real time). Guy Richie is a incredibly talented director and filmmaker. His attention to detail, in terms of wardrobe, architecture, and other historical markers, make this mid-19th Century detective drama a sheer pleasure to absorb.

Dedicated Sherlock Holmes movie fans may find it takes some readjustment to get used to this 2009 version of the fictional consulting detective.  This is not the Sherlock Holmes we've gotten to know from countless past movies nor quite the character Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described in his short stories and novels.  This newly interpreted Sherlock Holmes is as much an invention of director Guy Ritchie and the film's star, Robert Downey, Jr., as it is a creation of the original author.

Nonetheless, that doesn't mean the new film or its characters don't work.  Just think of them as a little different from how we've pictured them before.  Not that Ritchie and Downey take all that many liberties, however.  There is really nothing in the film beyond the new plot line that Doyle himself didn't at least mention in his stories.  For instance, this new Holmes behaves more in the manner of a modern action hero than the purely methodical, deductive private investigator we've come to know.

Is the new characterization too far afield?  Not really, since, for example, Doyle himself alludes to Holmes being an expert fencer and a skillful boxer.  Furthermore, this new Holmes is anything but the meticulously neat, compulsively tidy Holmes we usually see, but, again, Doyle actually describes his character as being rather careless about his housekeeping chores, often using his lodgings at 221B Baker Street as a personal laboratory and workshop.  In addition, Doyle tells us that Holmes frequently used drugs in his early career (a 7% solution of cocaine) and that while Holmes never married, he did admire and perhaps even fall in love with a worthy adversary, the beautiful Irene Adler (played here by Rachel McAdams, the only weak link in the cast, as she doesn't seem quite up to being as cunning and brilliant as the role demands).

What Ritchie and Downey do is embroider and magnify the traits Conan Doyle had already given his main character.  It's just that in most of Doyle's stories, Holmes never has to resort to much physical activity.  In the new movie, the filmmakers exploit Holmes's natural athletic abilities as well as his acquired talents to produce an amusing, action-packed thriller.  If this Holmes smacks more of Tony Stark than of Conan Doyle, it's no accident.

As for Holmes's best friend, confident, and biographer, Dr. John Watson, we have the unfortunate (though highly entertaining) 1930's-40's characterization of actor Nigel Bruce to blame for thinking of him as a bumbling old fool.  The fact is, in the Doyle stories, Holmes and Watson are approximately the same age, their late twenties, when they first meet and take up rooms together, and Doyle describes the doctor as anything but the blundering, blathering blockhead Bruce made him out to be.  Indeed, Doyle tells us that before their meeting, Watson was a military surgeon in the Second Afghan War, where he was severely wounded.  The author goes on to explain that Watson was a strongly built fellow and apparently quite the ladies' man, mentioning Watson getting married at least twice, perhaps three times during the long course of the stories.  Jude Law plays Watson in the new movie, and he is more in keeping with Doyle's vision of the man: strong, intelligent, cultured, dapper, and dependable.

And what of the famous deerstalker cap, Inverness cape, and curved Meerschaum pipe we have so long associated with the detective?  You won't find them in this movie, as they were the products of other people--the artist Sydney Paget and the stage actor William Gillette--who added their own touches to the legend.

What we get in Ritchie and Downey's reinvention of the Sherlock Holmes saga is a vigorous, resourceful, almost devil-may-care detective, still brilliant, witty, and arrogant but more prone to take chances than we've seen from the likes of previous actors in the part.  Downey will not remind you of Clive Brook, Arthur Wontner, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Roger Moore, Nicol Williamson, Christopher Plummer, Ian Richardson, Jeremy Brett, nor any of the countless other folks who have undertaken the role.  Downey is unmistakably his own man, making this Sherlock Holmes a logical-minded tough guy, as memorable and as commendable as he is different.

As for director Guy Ritchie, you probably remember him from bloody, goofy, hyperkinetic British crime capers like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Snatch,"" ""Revolver,"" and ""RocknRolla.""  Similar to those movies, ""Sherlock Holmes"" boasts an almost indecipherable plot.  Suffice it to say that Holmes brings his considerable intellect to bear on a case involving an occult evil of monumental proportions.  But don't even try to figure it out; just enjoy the black-hearted villains (Mark Strong, Robert Maillet), the lovely ladies (Ms. McAdams, Kelly Reilly), and all the cliff-hangers and derring-do.

No, don't fret about the plot.  Instead, enjoy the characters, the acting, the action, the music, and the look of the film.  For instance, Ritchie creates a wonderfully grimy atmosphere in the movie, a London of the late nineteenth century that is anything but picturesque.  That colorful London fog we've all seen in countless other movies was in reality more of a London smoke and soot, and we see it everywhere in the city, even coating the front of Holmes's rooms on Baker Street.  Ritchie and the filmmakers planned their recreation of London thoroughfares, street life, and clothing with deliberate care for period accuracy.  This Holmes may not sport a deerstalker cap, but the outfits he does wear are authentic to the time.  And Hans Zimmer's delightful musical score, nominated for an Oscar, probably should have won the award.  It's one of the few soundtracks I wouldn't mind listening to again on CD.

If the movie has a weakness, though, it's Ritchie's propensity for long, nonstop action sequences, even when they're not entirely needed.  Sure, it's an action movie above all, but unlike other Sherlock Holmes movies where our following the detective's deductions is the main attraction, in this movie it's the character's constant physical activity that draws our attention, with hardly a quiet moment in the whole affair.  (I did like a relatively restrained restaurant scene with Holmes, Watson, and Watson's fiance, Mary Morston.  It plays effortlessly, draws upon an intelligent sense of humor, and offers a pleasing coda.)  I just wished that things would have slowed down for more than a few minutes at a time.  It also means, however, that there's never a dull moment.  While leaving one rather breathless at times is hardly the kind of thing one thinks of in a Sherlock Holmes film, here we take it for granted.

Indeed, the style, the action, and the main characters in this Sherlock Holmes adventure are so different from the movies that have come before it, this entry does not fit neatly into the customary Holmes canon.  Get used to it, because with the film's having taken in well over $200,000,000 at the box office, I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock any more than we've seen the last of him as Iron Man.  Especially when we see shadow of Holmes's arch nemesis, Professor Moriarity, lurking in the background.

Video:
First, understand that director Guy Ritchie intended for ""Sherlock Holmes"" to reflect a dark, gritty, grimy vision of nineteenth-century London, complete with a subdued color palette that runs high to grays, browns, blues, and blacks.  That said, WB's widescreen transfer of the movie's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio comes off terrifically well, the video engineers using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec to accomplish the deed.

Clarity is largely excellent except when Ritchie is playing around with different cameras and lenses.  Black levels are deep.  Detailing is fine, especially in most close-ups.  Despite its sometimes pale appearance, the image looks about the way I remember it from a movie theater, with no digital artifacts, haloing, or filtering to interfere with the situation.  In other words, I enjoyed the video quality immensely.

Audio:
When I watched the standard-definition version of the movie, with its regular, lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, I found the audio very dynamic, to be sure, yet it often translated into simply being very loud.  On Blu-ray disc, the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is even more dynamic, yet it doesn't seem as noisy loud to me, possibly because the sound is smoother.

The noise of a carriage in the opening scene establishes the sonic tone for the picture as the vehicle, horses, and wheels clatter realistically from behind left, overhead, and into the front speakers.  This is primarily an action movie, and the audio will not let you forget it for a minute.  Not only does the soundtrack capture the impact of carriages, clubs, fists, bullets, and explosions, it provides a sturdy surround mix, too, notable in most of the fights and chases, in the crowd scenes at a boxing match, even in the subtle noises at a restaurant.  The rear and side channels help to recreate the hustle and bustle of London streets as well as convey the musical bloom of Hans Zimmer's musical track.  In all, this is one of the better soundtracks I've heard in any high-def format.

Extras:
The primary bonus is a Blu-ray exclusive, a ""Maximum Movie Mode.  This is a combination of picture-in-picture, director walk-through, timeline, storyboard comparison, etc.  It's an extension of what WB used to call their ""In-Movie Experience.""  After that are eight ""Focus Points"" (totaling over thirty-one minutes) that repeat the featurettes found in the ""Maximum Movie Mode."" The other bonus item is a fourteen-minute segment, ""Sherlock Holmes Reinvented,"" a typical behind-the-scenes affair with the stars, director, and filmmakers, most of which is covered in the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" and ""Focus Points.""

Additionally, there are thirty scene selections; a series of promos and trailers at start-up only; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Then, because this is a Combo Pack, you also get a standard-definition DVD and a standard-definition digital copy for iTunes and Windows Media (the offer expiring on March 28, 2011).  Finally, a light cardboard slipcover encloses the two-disc Blu-ray case.

Parting Thoughts:
Although ""Sherlock Holmes"" may not be the Sherlock Holmes film people were expecting, it's lively and exciting enough to hold the attention of most action-movie fans.  Robert Downey, Jr. creates a brand-new interpretation of Holmes, and Jude Law makes a splendid, conservative contrast to his more-mercurial friend.  What's more, the whole show is visually stunning, so even if the action doesn't excite you, Guy Ritchie's reconstruction of nineteenth-century London might interest you.  Look, listen, and enjoy without thinking about it too much.

Incidentally, I was a little surprised that the Wife-O-Meter liked the movie as much as I did, maybe more.  She said she liked the movie's light, romantic adventure, its excitement and intrigue, and its endless good humor.  Fair enough.",1434758400,,11271,5.151648351648352

2044483,4,B0001Z3TS4,"It's time for a true confession.  While I am a mystery fan, I have only ever read a few Sherlock Holmes short stories.  So I don't have a deep love for the character.  Still, the previews for the latest movie version of the classic character seemed to make him a modern, wise cracking action hero.  I wasn't sure I would like that.  But when a friend wanted to see the film, I said I'd go.  Turns out I'm glad I did because it was a good film.

Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) have been sharing rooms at 221 B Baker Street for some time.  Dr. Watson has also become a good friend and investigative partner to Holmes.  So Watson's upcoming move to a new address to get married is very hard on the detective.

In his last few days as a bachelor, Dr. Watson agrees to be the attending physician at the hanging of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), the last killer that Holmes and Watson caught together.  But a few days after his death, Blackwood's grave is destroyed and rumors start that he is still alive.  As the city goes into a panic, Holmes begins to investigate.  The investigation also brings Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) back into his life.  Can he withstand this criminal's charms again to get to the truth behind the rumors?

For those only familiar with the character from the previous movies, this will seem like a different Holmes.  In many ways, however, it does go back to the roots of the character.  He's a smoker who drives those around him to distraction with his experiments.  He also is a little self-absorbed.  But they give him enough wise cracks early in the movie to make him into a truly enjoyable character.  And you truly feel for him as he struggles with losing his best friend as Watson prepares to move out.  They've definitely added some bromance to the story, and it really works.  When things get more serious for the final reel, you want to stick around and see how things turn out.

The mystery is constructed very well.  While my friend picked up on many of the clues, I missed many of them.  This led me to feeling like an idiot for not picking up on them when we reached the climax.  True, some things were sprung on us at the last minute.  But we had enough clues to solve things before the end if we were paying enough attention.

The acting was very good as well.  Robert Downey, Jr. is perfect as the famous detective, and Jude Law manages to make Dr. Watson into a sympathetic straight man.  The rest of the cast does fine as well, but I have to praise Kelly Reilly.  She could have gotten lost in the shuffle as Watson's fiancee, but she makes the character real enough that her very few scenes were some of the most memorable.

The movie looked wonderful.  They did an amazing job of recreating Victorian London.  As far as special effects, my only comment is what special effects?  Oh, I know they used effects for the climax, and I'm sure they were used elsewhere, but I never even though about them.  I was so caught up in the story that it any effects in the film weren't even something that registered in my brain.

My only complaints are on technical grounds.  The soundtracks was mixed so that the dialog was hard to follow at times.  And some of the ways they chose to tell the story were a little confusing.  Fortunately, they didn't keep stopping the action for Holmes to narrate his thoughts on his upcoming physical attack on someone.  Twice was more than enough.  But a couple of the flashbackish type thingies were a little confusing, especially with the way they were edited.  And the boxing scene was gratuitous to the rest of the movie.

Complaints aside, Sherlock Holmes was an enjoyable movie.  Part action, part comedy, and part mystery, it delivers escapist entertainment.",1430265600,,3764,4.511111111111111

Scientific development by way of keen insight and deductive reasoning is an underlying theme in this wildly entertaining rendition of the world's most famous Victorian period detective. Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes gift-wraps for its audience what moviegoers crave in a cinematic experience, delivering a spellbinding and thrilling masterpiece of adventure, action, and mystery, using science as a driving force.

The fervently logical Holmes (played by Robert Downey Jr.) astounds the audience with originality around every turn, always on the cusp of new ideas. With the use of science and his keen powers of observation, Holmes continually debunks supernatural thinking, constantly working to expose the trickery of the villainous Lord Blackwood (played by Mark Strong). Upon Blackwood's ostensible resurrection from the grave, for example, Dr. Watson (played by Jude Law) proffers the idea that ""a supernatural explanation is theoretically possible."" But Holmes in his distinctive manner respectful of scientific inquiry responds, ""It's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data. Inevitably, one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts,"" eventually exposing all of the ""conjuring tricks"" employed by Blackwood and his cronies, using the power of deduction to reveal the villain's charlatanry, cleverly tying up any loose ends by the film's end. Holmes' perspective regarding the aforementioned importance of theory, data, and facts illustrates a fundamental aspect of the scientific method that underscores the evolving developments of the time: the importance of scientific thinking over the perpetuation of superstitious thinking. The insight is powerful and relevant even in today's contemporary society.

Holmes' knowledge and keen observations are not merely confined to the world of police detection; they also extend into his surrounding environment, capitalizing on opportunities to detail the technological advancements of his time. The scene involving the bascule and suspension bridge becomes a focal point for Holmes while on his way to meet with Lord Blackwood in prison, underscoring the first-time use of the technological innovation for Dr. Watson. British ingenuity receives a nod of acknowledgement in this scene, Holmes saying, ""What an industrious empire,"" acknowledging Britain's move toward industrialization during that period.

Holmes also salutes the ideas propounded by Charles Darwin, influential in the Victorian period for his profound contributions to science (evolution). A scene entailing Holmes' meeting with Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice, confirms Darwin's influence. Holmes details the shared unique traits of Sir Rotheram and Lord Blackwood's irises, traits ""which are only passed down through direct bloodline,"" an explicit underscoring of the unique (genetic) traits only family members share.

With brilliant potency, wit, cutting edge science and technology, Sherlock Holmes captivates the audience. Holmes epitomizes scientific ingenuity, reminding us of the importance of scientific development during the Victorian period, a new way of thinking. The film is an amazing look into the future from the perspective of the past.",1422921600,,3239,5.853813559322034

At first, I didn't know how the pair would match up, but they play the roles in spectacular fashion and make a dynamic duo. This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie. If you are not familiar with his other films, they are filmed with a lot of slow motion segments that are interesting if you like that sort of thing. This movie has comedy and is filled with adventure and some pretty good special effects. The Blu-ray is is very clear and crisp and the sound is very good quality.

However, if you've ever read any Sherlock Holmes, or heck,  seen any BBC Sherlock, you'll quickly notice that this movie is not true to Sherlock's personality, and Watson is merely the straight man reacting to his eccentric partner's behavior.

So if you've read it... You'll hate it (unless you are capable of over looking its flaws). If you've never read it, I think you'll like it.",1418688000,,425,4.72972972972973

I suppose, if you can't stand good writing and really intriguing characters as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this might seem...acceptable or even a good film.

2045036,3,B0001Z3TS4,"This is a very difficult film to review fairly. For starters, fans of Conan Doyle's stories, or any of the classic Holmes films will be put off by the fact that this is primarily an action movie. While Holmes was established as both a proficient sword-fighter and boxer in various novels and short stories, these were skills he always fell back on. In this film, there are a number of scenes where Holmes acts more like John McLean from the 'Die Hard' movies than himself. There's a pointless fight scene in a boxing club, a pointless fight scene which results in Holmes and Watson having to dodge an anchor being dragged across a dock by a sinking ship, and, of course, the requisite action movie scene of Holmes running away from an explosion in slow-motion.

Now, this isn't to say that Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' doesn't have some positive qualities to it. For starters, Robert Downey Jr is very good as Holmes. While he may not be as iconic as Basil Rathbone, nor as layered as Christopher Plummer, or as revisionist as Benedict Cumberbatch, Downey Jr is, without a doubt, the highlight of this movie. His accent may sound very forced, and slips back into his natural American accent at times, but his characterization of Holmes is about as close to the source material as the script would allow. Even if some of the things he's given to do are ridiculous (such as inventing the silencer, completely discounting Hiram Percy Maxim) he still plays Holmes as the eccentric, and at times socially inept, master detective that has enthralled audiences for generations. When not on a case, he sits in his cluttered flat, playing the violin, and conducting bizarre experiments that make sense only to him.

Jude Law, while a talented actor, is given nothing to do as Watson. By the movie's own admission, the good doctor doesn't want anything to do with the case, and is only along for the ride in order to preserve the dynamic. In fact, most of Watson's dialogue is either insisting that he doesn't want to be there, or questioning why he is there. After a while, the audience is forced to ask the latter question themselves; if Watson has nothing to do, why is he in the movie at all? None of the things he does are things Holmes couldn't do himself, and while some may argue that that is always the case, there is a reason why Holmes and Watson work together in all the various pieces of Sherlock Holmes media; they work well together, and Watson's life experience and down-to-earth personality help keep Holmes in check, often making him realize that the solution to a problem isn't always a complex Machiavellian scheme, but sometimes it's the answer that's sitting right in front of your face. It would have been easy to give Watson at least one or two scenes that show that the story couldn't progress without him, but as it stands, he's there because he's supposed to be, not because he needs to be.

The rest of the cast are serviceable in their roles, but none really stand out. This could be blamed on the rather bland script, which relegates all the good lines to Holmes, but a truly great performance can elevate mediocre material, and that simply isn't the case here.

The mystery itself is actually quite good, and, while a bit convoluted, manages to keep you guessing the method for quite some time. I say the method, because the film reveals the villain pretty much from the opening sequence, and the driving force of the mystery is how he's accomplishing the things he's doing. This strikes me as a poor choice, since having both mysteries would have been more engaging, but to the movie's credit it does the one mystery well.

This movie is not easy to pin down; it's a loud, flashy action movie, but at the same time it has a very well-told mystery that requires you to think about lines that may seem insignificant. It's about as far from the classic portrayals of Sherlock Holmes as one could get, but still stays recognizable as an adaptation. It's not really a good movie, but I can't call it bad without feeling like I'm not giving it the credit it deserves. I would say that any fan of Sherlock Holmes, or mysteries in general, should give this movie a fair chance, but try to either rent it or catch it on TV to see if it's for you, then decide if you want to add it to your collection.",1398384000,,4316,4.592736705577172

2045089,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Read the original Doyles, have seen the gamut of Holmes and Watson from the 30s to now. What I can say is this version of the characters is quite shocking. Not so effete, or fastidious  and moves right along, no shilly-shallying.  After all when you've seen ""They Might Be Giants"" with George C. Scott as Holmes and a woman as Watson, one can stretch. But this film has 2 things that really make it stand out. One is the story line is very mysterious and very consistent. The other is it is well edited. I happen to be a fan of Victorian England, and so the mysterious cabal was very satisfyingly revealed. (Can't say that about the 2nd one they did, which was a giant snooze despite the nearly constant noisy fighting of one sort or another.) This film has a kind of primordial steampunk quality, with the London Tower bridge still under construction. The realistic touches of the actual squalor and brutality  that the lower class citizens lived in those times in the city was very convincing. A good mystery, an able Holmes, and a much more with-it Watson. The villain is suitably horrible, as was his  diabolical plot. So, I recommend it, as a story in its own right.",1394064000,,1171,4.535545023696683

2045105,4,B0001Z3TS4,"""Sherlock Holmes"", starring Robert Downey Jr., was an interesting version/take of the iconic character. The movie managed to keep me guessing how the main villain survived his hanging and if he was truly a warlock... Anyway, I must say this movie had it all (i.e. comedy, action, a captivating story, mystery, suspense, twists and turns, and an idiosyncratic cinematic lead character (i.e. Robert Downey Jr.) who manages to pull off a worthy British accent, as if he were jolly old England's Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit. However, there were some scenes that were irrelevant, such as the boxing scene where Robert Downey Jr. is boxing (for what?).

Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law put memorable imprints on Holmes and Watson in this bold new reimagining that makes the legendary sleuth a daring man of action as well as a peerless man of intellect. Baffling clues, astonishing Holmesian deductions, nimble repartee, catch-your-breath scenes of one slam thing after another--director Guy Ritchie helms the excitement reintroducing the great detective to the world.

If you don't trust the plot, throw in a fist-fight or a huge explosion or something equally as lame, and the audiences will eat it up.  What I always loved about Doyle's Holmes was the subtlety with which he treated his character, but there's none of that here.  The characters are drawn very poorly, and there's really no motivation to be seen at all, other than ""this is what I do""; it's especially hard to see why Watson would still be hanging around Holmes at all.  We may be able to come up with explanations on our own, but the filmmakers provide no motivation for this at all.  All in all, fairly entertaining for an evening, but I would rather have watched something else--and I can't think of any reason to watch this again.",1389398400,,895,4.5

2045237,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I love how this retelling of the classic Sherlock Holmes goes. It's not spot on, but then what movie ever is. The costumes are great and the acting is superb. I also love the wit that was added to the characters.

2045242,3,B0001Z3TS4,Although I love Rober Downey Jr. this movie was not all that.  Don't know what all the hype was about. Not sure I'll bother watching the next one.,1388361600,,146,4.214285714285714
2045243,4,B0001Z3TS4,"R. Downey, Jr. and J. Law play very well off each other as Holmes & Watson. R. McAdams is an interesting addition as Professor Moriarty's assistant and Holmes' love interest.  Very good story line with well paced action and enhancing music score.",1388361600,,246,4.857142857142857

2045246,5,B0001Z3TS4,"You really can't go wrong with Robert Downey Jr., he is a great actor and fills the part excellently, the story line was perfect and all the actors played their parts so well. I had always wanted to see this movie from the time it came out but never had the chance to do so, it never appeared on HBO, Starz, or any of the other premium channels, although the sequel did. So I was able to watch the sequel before seeing this first portion. Anyway this movie is great from the story line, to the actors, to the special effects and to the ending, overall a wonderful movie to watch and not just watch a wonderful movie to sit back relax and enjoy!",1388188800,,644,4.201612903225806

2045291,5,B0001Z3TS4,I cannot rate the movie itself since I purchased it for a Christmas gift.  I have read the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and I'm sure the movie will be as spectacular.  Who doesn't love a good mystery.  I would recommend this item primarily because Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are both excellent actors.,1387670400,,307,4.446428571428571

Great movie although Robert Downey Jr. is slightly difficult to understand at times. His british accent is good, but he has a tendency to speak too quickly. But, regardless, it's a great movie!",1387584000,,232,4.825

I first rented this from my local library because I had recently discovered that I was a HUGE RDJ fan after watching Iron Man and Heart and Souls, I loved this movie and quickly rented the sequel. I then found the movie on a Black Friday sale and had to add it to my collection. If you love RDJ, action and mystery, then here it is! 5 big stars.",1387497600,,370,4.082191780821918

This movie would have been BAD A$$ is they made it in 3D, who knows we may get a post conversation later. It was filmed perfectly for a great 3D.",1387324800,,401,4.2894736842105265

2045310,5,B0001Z3TS4,"This movie is fun to watch, with great chemistry of Holmes (Downey Jr) and Watson (Law). Directing (Ritchie) is great, as is production, cinematography, music score and even the few martial arts fight scenes. This version of Sherlock Holmes keeps with the idiosyncratic traditions of all the Holmes versions that had come before it, yet with updates that modernize Holmes and Watson all at once. The script and directing run on tight loop. Watch out for Mark Strong's villain who is just as good, if not better.",1387238400,,511,4.885057471264368
2045311,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Hmmm ... Sherlock as an action hero took some getting used to, but Robert Downey Jr made it work.  There is enough of the cerebral Holmes left to shift this movie slightly out of the standard action movie ruts.  There are more than enough loud noises and bright flashes to satisfy the 10-year-old lizard brain lurking inside the reasoning adult, so I give the movie 4 stars for appealing to more of the brain than I expected.

This film recommends itself to many audiences, so see the movie if:
You like fast action without cars or flying suits
You like solving mental puzzles
You are a steam punk

Enjoy!",1387238400,,605,4.522935779816514

2045329,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I am in love! I have never been a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. As a child who read anything and everything - and thoroughly enjoyed Dickens - the books bored me. So I was reluctant to watch the movies, even though I couldn't see Robert Downey, Jr making anything boring. I finally watched this one after #2 came out, and immediately bought both. Can't wait for the next!",1386720000,,369,4.36231884057971

2045331,4,B0001Z3TS4,"The adventures of Sherlock Holmes has been told many different times in many different ways and this times takes a more modern and darker tone. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show as he makes a great lead and does an excellent job delivering his lines and giving emotion to his character. The other characters perform decently, but nothing to write home about. The story was excellent and kept me guessing the whole way into it, and the actions are really well done.",1386547200,,464,4.670731707317073

I guess I don't care, as I will probably never watch it. It's just that to me 'used' is not the same as a 'rental'. Thankfully there are no scratches on the disc. I have not yet tried it in the player.",1385683200,,478,3.9791666666666665

Jude Law on the other hand is a splendid Watson.  Sadly, this film will not hold up over time. The picture is enjoyable but Conan Doyal would have difficulty recognizing it.",1384905600,,309,4.923076923076923

2045368,4,B0001Z3TS4,"This is not necessarily correct as far as the book goes, so there are those who were disappointed.  For myself, however, it was quite fun and certainly does the legend justice.  I've long felt that sherlock holmes was not done justice in the conservative old versions, where he's all proper and stuft.  I found it quite refreshing that someone saw fit to bring this colossal figure to life with the humor and the raw power that he possesses in the books.",1383868800,,454,4.580246913580247
2045369,3,B0001Z3TS4,Great acting wonderful plot too bad it is basically a cartoon with human actors. Give me the original Sherlock Holmes with real sets and real places.,1383696000,,149,4.769230769230769
2045370,2,B0001Z3TS4,It really would have been a great movie except for fact that they called it Sherlock Holmes.  This is more of a parody of Holmes then an actual Sherlock Holmes film.  Downey's character bears no resemblance to the Holmes in the books.  The characters  can make references to the canon all day long but it won't make this a SH film.  Check out the DVDs with Jeremy Brett from the 1980s. if you want to meet the real Sherlock Holmes and Watson.,1383696000,,442,4.341463414634147

2045372,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Always a fan of Sherlock Holmes and his author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but this adds a bit of modern twist. The film keeps to the usual standards that we expect from Holmes but shows a bit more of his conflicted mind.  People forget that Holmes was also a drug user to keep his powerful mind from overloading, so the peculiarities shown in the film are actually somewhat believable.  I enjoy the scenery design, costumes and the more powerful role that Dr. Watson portrayed.  Even if it's not a true ""social commentary film"", it is entertainment and that's usually why I watch movies.",1383091200,,583,4.640776699029126

2045400,5,B0001Z3TS4,must admit that I had my doubts regarding Robert Downey Jr portraying Sherlock Holmes.  My doubts were swept aside as I watched the film.  The essence of Sherlock was there with a dash of Downey.  Jude Law is the perfect Dr. Watson.  It was very enjoyable film.,1381708800,,261,4.48936170212766
2045401,4,B0001Z3TS4,I liked the movie very much. Holmes purists may find that Holmes is more crazy than the books show him. If I was casting the roles of Holmes and Watson I would have reversed the actors. Jude Law looks more like what Holmes should look to me.,1381708800,2,241,4.148936170212766

2045407,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I am admittedly not familiar with the Sherlock Holmes novels, but I have seen the excellent BBC series.  That treatment is set in a modern day London, so it was quite nice to see an equally well executed version of the characters in a late-1800s London.  As always, it's nearly as fun to see that past era recreated as it is to see a story unfold within it.

It's easy to imagine this material in that setting turning out stuffy and slow, but it really doesn't.  The pacing and action are in line with what today's audiences expect, and they are executed very well.",1379808000,2,565,4.403846153846154
2045408,5,B0001Z3TS4,I am a big Sherlock fan and even had the old radio version on old tapes. Downey is a 360 from Basil but I like his quirky ways and more modern take to the stories. Give it a try these two make a perfect combo,1379548800,,208,3.6444444444444444

2045410,4,B0001Z3TS4,I think Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job in portraying Sherlock Holmes in this movie. It was full of suspense and action and kept you on the edge of your seat during the length of the film. Well done.,1378857600,2,206,4.175

2045445,5,B0001Z3TS4,"You could call me a purist Holmesian fan.

Having read all 60 novels and short stories, loving those, and moving on to Jeremy Brett's brilliant Granada TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, then Benedict Cumberbatch's electrifying Sherlock, even dabbling in CBS's Elementary and a myriad of movies, I find myself loving most the shows and films that homaged Conan Doyle's brilliant works, while forging new paths that kept it all fresh and exciting.

Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a different beast. Holmes now uses his fists and whatever he can get his hands on to fight crime, becoming an almost superheroic action figure. Watson carries a gun and is not afraid to use it. The duo are battling demonic, occultic priests. Irene Adler is back and she's American (Canadian?). This is more of an action-thriller than a crime drama. Yet the movie works.

Here's why:
1. The cast: There is only one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Downey-Jr/dp/B001KZG99A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Downey Jr.</a>, and he has got to be one of the coolest, funniest, most charismatic actors around. He imbibes his endless charm and likeable roguishness into his every role, and Sherlock Holmes is one of his best performances. Troublesome, rude, brash, and utterly deadly with both fists and brain, his Sherlock may not stand up to Brett's or Cumberbatch's in terms of intellect or accuracy to the source material, but he sure is rivetingly madcap and entertaining.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jude-Law/dp/B0085OELXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jude Law</a>&nbsp;is playing the straight man, but his Dr. Watson is not your usual stodgy sidekick. Instead, he uses his two fists and his dogged British determination to aid in crime fighting.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eddie-Marsan/dp/B00DGMVJAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eddie Marsan</a>&nbsp;is a fantastic Lestrade; slightly thick but the spitting image of the steadfast London bobby.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-Strong/dp/B003XQPYR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark Strong</a>&nbsp;chews up the scenery and is cool as a cucumber (as usual!) as the sinister occultist Lord Blackwood.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-MacAdams/dp/B000YMM3CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel MacAdams</a>&nbsp;makes for a charming and devious Irene Adler.

2. The production design: This London is gray and gritty, lit by dim street lamps, with brown mud making the wet cobblestones slippery, where the mist coming off the Thames makes an ghostly effect. The houses are small, wooden, stained with soot and grime, and positively spooky. This is a London where you could easily imagine Alistair Crowley or Jack the Ripper prowling round the corner in the fog. The scenery, costumes, and cinematography are all period accurate and atmospheric. Sherlock Holmes has other technically superb aspects: the kinetic camerawork, the rousing score by Hans Zimmer, and the muddy, gritty costumes, not to mention the dialogue, which is often very sharp and darkly comic. Let me mention the screenplay, which was (pun intended) devilishly plotted, with those fantastic aha! moments so famous in Sherlock Holmes and seemingly insignificant clues that allow our hero to use his noggin present and accounted for!

3. Guy Ritchie: Watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snatch/dp/B000SP1SEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snatch</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lock-Stock-and-Two-Smoking-Barrels/dp/B000ID37QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a>&nbsp;if you want to know what I'm talking about. His filming style is kinetic, stylish, smooth, packed with action, engaging, and completely original. Think Quentin Tarantino meets Michael Bay. Excellently choreographed fight scenes (""Discombobulate...""), and stunning slo-motion mix with cool close-ups, camera angles, and an original style of fighting before seen only in Chinese wuxia epics - planning the fight in your head based on logic and probability. It is his wickedly cool style that elevates Sherlock Holmes among other period action flicks.

Cons? Only that Sherlock Holmes does away with about 100 years of history and lore of Sherlock Holmes to deliver something shockingly, almost brazenly original. This is definitely NOT the books. Good thing? Bad thing? Who knows?

In conclusion, Sherlock Holmes is wickedly engrossing and entertaining; with slick action sequences and sharp acting and writing, featuring a standout performance by Robert Downey Jr. Guy Ritchie and cast have fun, and the fun is contagious. Sherlock Holmes is a fun and cool, if a little (*ahem*) elementary night at the movies. As a Sherlock film, it makes some questionable choices, but as a dark action crime piece, it can do no wrong.

2045485,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Having seen this movie a couple of time already I decided to buy it. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent portrayal of Sherlock Homes. Also the Victorian London scenery is accurate. I was born in London, so I've been many times. This is a highly entertaining movie, with humor, action and some suprises along the way!",1376784000,3,316,4.660714285714286

2045487,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Glancing at some of the most useful reviews which head the evaluations of the movie, I find them saying about all that needs to be said on the subject of the two questions which must be asked (by some of us) about it. First, is this a good movie regardless of whether we consider it to be a Holmesian descendent  or not.  From my viewpoint, as a mystery-thriller, it could hold its own, whether the detective is called Holmes or Smith. I would go further and say that it is a good movie with a screenplay that is well in keeping with the requirements to be recognized as within the latitude allowed by the original Conan Doyle stories. Second, if it is a good Holmes story, does Downey make a Holmes we can accept (and a Watson as a secondary consideration). On the latter question, my view is that most of the Watson's  who have appeared in recent films, theatrical or television (since the end of the Nigel Bruce era), have been allowed to be better than was Nigel Bruce. This is not  a criticism of Bruce, who was a fine actor, capable of doing an excellent job as Watson, the bosses decreed that there should be a contrast between the brilliant Holmes and a doddering, constantly bemused, Watson--and that's what he was forced to do. As others have pointed out, that image is not the one Conan Doyle created. In this movie, the Watson certainly makes the grade as true to the original and in line with most post-Bruce conceptions, a good strong character. As to Downey's, Holmes, it certainly lacks the particular qualities and demeanor we have come to expect in A level productions; nevertheless, as a tentative judgment, I will have to see the movie again, and, perhaps, more than that, to feel confident in my views, I lean toward saying that the screenplay's delineation, with the strength and skill he brings to the part, not only opens us up to this as an acceptable modernized conception, but as one which can stand with the best of previous conceptions. I do not mean he can replace the best of them, simply, that he can stand with them as an equal.
None of this matters much to the non-Holmesians; for the general public, I will simply go along with the crowd and advise seeing it for a very entertaining couple of hours.",1376611200,,2234,4.522277227722772

2045490,5,B0001Z3TS4,"This movie is pure entertainment from the very first scene to the last. I refer to this depiction of Holmes & Watson as 'alternate' because the characters aren't quite in line with Doyle's depiction of them in his brilliant novels. But, the actors do maintain the essential elements of Doyle's characters. The unspoken friendship love, and loyal bond between them. The incomparable deduction, and awareness capabilities of Holmes, with the human element of not always being right. Robert Downey gives this figure a lively jolt, that makes him more 3 dimensional, and believable. I really like Jude Law's interpretation of Watson. He is anything but a buffoon without a clue, as so many others have portrayed him. This was well worth the instant rental fee I paid.

2045546,1,B0001Z3TS4,"Well before this movie came out, even before most people had heard about it, I printed out three photos, RDJ, Jude Law, and Mark Strong in costume. I would ask people to choose which one was going to play Sherlock Holmes. Everyone picked Mark Strong. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie's treatment of the stories and character of Sherlock Holmes and this pretty much exemplifies it.
Robert Downey Jr makes a perfect Tony Stark. He was wonderful as Charlie Chaplin. He seems to have lived down his past. He is nothing like Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is tall and lean with a ""catlike love of personal cleanliness"". Not short, rumpled, unshaven and wearing a dressing gown that looks like rats have been nesting in it. I'm not going to go into personality discrepancies.
I spent Christmas day 2009 in a theater an hour's drive from my home in order to see this on opening day. I own the dvd of this and the sequel. I try to be fair.

2045564,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Like everyone else in the world, I instantly went cross-eyed at the idea of Guy Ritchie making a Sherlock Holmes movie.

Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.

As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.

But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?

This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).

His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.

But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (""No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!""). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.

The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.

Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.

""Sherlock Holmes"" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.",1367193600,,3283,4.827402135231317

However, my 2 sons talked me into watching it a second time a few days ago (about a year later) and I realized this time, just how well done that movie was.  It was classic Holmes with a new twist, plenty of action, charisma, and mystery and well worth the watch a second time.  So we decided a few days later to watch the 2nd one in the series called ""Game of Shadows"" and it was Awesome (even better than the 1st).

Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) in this presentation is just as observant as usual but is better informed of different disciplines that the original. He uses wily disguises and beautiful women to accomplish his goal of detecting and foiling the cunning bad guys. This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.

Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is more of second Holms but a different set of bad habits. He saves Holmes' bacon several times. However, Watson wants to go his own way and settle down with his newfound love Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams.)

This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.  Holmes is bantering with the insidious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has recently risen from the dead and is determined to create a new world order.  Little does he know that they are all pawns in a larger scheme by ""you know who.""  Oh, all right I will say it Professor Moriarty.

This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.

Keep watching as the final credits role by. It is nice to see that they tie the names of the character and the actors together with pictures of the characters. I cannot stand disembodies names scrolling by. The is a picture of a naked man, handcuffed to the bead and the caption ""Costumes Designer Jenny Beavan""

2045588,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009) features Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective a traditional setting, but provides a fresh take on the classic characters, incorporating scientific advances, and making full use of modern filmmaking techniques, to produce an intriguing mystery and thrilling adventure.  It's a long way from the traditional Holmes, but with a good number of familiar elements.

Robert Downey Jr. makes a smooth transition from Tony Stark to Sherlock Holmes, continuing to resurrect a career that just a few years ago, seemed to be in question. Jude Law (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca/dp/B000HEVZ6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca</a>) joins the long list of actors to play Dr. John H. Watson.  In several ways, this version of Watson is closer to being Holmes' equal, particularly when it comes to fighting, and other action scenes.

The central story involving a plot to take over the Government, is intricate and quite grand, as Lord Blackwell (Mark Strong), a man involved with the occult, who was hanged for murder, apparently returns from the dead.  Holmes' investigation uncovers more that is bizarre, as obscure clues somehow fit into a convoluted plot, quite unique in the long history of Holmes.

Although the time frame fits, Holmes traditionalists may object to this take on the classic characters.  During the 1980's and 90's, Jeremy Brett had established himself as the modern embodiment of the traditional Holmes.  So something completely different, seems like a sensible option.  Quite amazingly, Sherlock Holmes continues to be a character with an enduring appeal that seems stronger than ever, as evidenced by the recent TV reimagining's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B004132I20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>&nbsp;(2010), and Elementary (2012).

Ritchie's film incorporates some cool storytelling devices, like numerous flashbacks to reveal hidden clues and plot developments, and stop action sequences.  Blackwell makes a worthy and imposing villain.  Rachel McAdams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Time-Traveller-s-Wife/dp/B001HN69CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Time Traveller's Wife</a>) plays Irene Adler, ""the woman"" in Holmes' life, who has a key role, working for a ""mysterious"" criminal mastermind, (whose identity anyone familiar with Sherlock Holmes could guess), setting the stage for the 2011 sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Game-of-Shadows/dp/B007K3JCAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes: The Game of Shadows</a>.

With impressive action sequences and special effects, an engaging storyline, bold musical score, and reinvented characters that interact in a lively manner, Sherlock Holmes was a huge success.  Robert Downey continues his remarkable return to form, as one of the most bankable of actors.

Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.

As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.

But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?

This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).

His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.

But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (""No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!""). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.

The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.

Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.

""Sherlock Holmes"" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.",1365379200,,3283,4.827402135231317

Now you can have them both on one Blu-Ray disc!!!!!",1365379200,,113,4.380952380952381
2045593,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are tolerable as Holmes and Watson, but the Irene Adler role for Rachel McAdams is worthless. Why do directors feel it necessary to heavily feature a character who was in only one of the original sixty stories? Villain Mark Strong is way over the top here; the only thing he succeeds at doing is looking like Andy Garcia's fat cousin.

The film itself? Mediocre theater trash. There's about 1000% more fighting in this 2-hour film than in the entire Holmes canon. And the CGI is very obvious and at times very, very bad. I can't imagine wanting to watch this a second time, let alone owning it on DVD. It's not the worst film I have ever seen--the Will Smith reboot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Wild-West/dp/B003NS5L8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Wild West</a>&nbsp;takes that cake for recent big budget disasters--but nor is this Sherlock even the faintest patch on the giants of the genre, for example, the Granada&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/production/dp/B000060MVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">production</a>&nbsp;starring Jeremy Brett. Conversely, this Guy Ritchie Steampunk-on-Steroids would barely be recognizable as Sherlock Holmes if not for all the name-dropping and the constant shots of ""221B"".

For a truly modern take on the great detective--in both senses of the word--look no further than the Cumberbatch-Freeman masterpiece (BBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>), currently in production for its third season.",1365206400,2,1669,6.651376146788991

In addition, this one became more overt in emphasizing baser conduct, something unheard of in the stories.  I was very disappointed in the continual inferences to homosexuality (between Holmes and Watson) and exhibitionism (Mycroft) - all foreign to the writings of Doyle.  The DVD also contained some actor interviews and comments, and it is clear that they considered it fun to be irreverent to the characters, in effect by slandering their memory.  I suppose it is the standard method for British and American humor these days.

This one had even more wild action and drama, and focused on Holmes' arch-enemy Moriarity.  As base as it was, the movie did convey the strong brotherly friendship between Holmes and Watson, though in an irreverent way.",1365206400,2,865,5.013986013986014

Only a few have ever given him a sense of humor that wasn't a parody but this portrayal is completely off the wall. Even so, there is still the drive, the ruthless logic that one sees as he calculates his moves to best effect. He may appear crazy, but one can see that he is anything but as he goes about his hunt of enemies that are- almost- his equal. In this, he seeks to apprehend a man already considered dead,yet risen from the grave,murdering the members of a secret club--and yet, this is not the most nefarious of his plans, plans that would put the Entire British Empire in jeopardy.

2045679,5,B0001Z3TS4,"This is a nice, robust version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character as he was written in the books.  Robert Downey, Jr. Is superb in this roe, and Jude Law a ought proper Dr. Watson.  The friendship between the two characters is clear.  In the old Basil Rathbone series, Watson was reduced to an associate of Holmes, but here, they rly on each other as true friends would.  Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler was marvelous, and Robert Downey, Jr.'s interactions with her were great.  I looked forward to seeing them together.  All in all, this is a worthy and enjoyable way to pass the hours.",1361145600,,586,4.533333333333333

2045722,1,B0001Z3TS4,"First of all, let me preface by saying that my husband and I love a good action adventure movie, and I adore Downey and Law. But like so many movie versions of pre-existing characters and stories, this one is too dark and violent. Add to that, the humor, and you have something that feels sick. I don't mind movies that re-invent or re-interpret characters and stories -- if they are done well and have integrity. The first Batman movies were terrific, but the later ones became too gruesome and perverse. This movie feels like a destruction of the original Sherlock Holmes. I feel sorry for the young people whose first (and maybe only) encounter with the great Sherlock Holmes will be this franchise. BTW, My husband hated this movie more than I did and he's not even that familiar with the original books.",1360540800,7,808,4.6573426573426575
2045723,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I will qualify my review by first stating that I would NOT be considered a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  Other than this movie, I've never watched any of the series on TV, nor do I believe that I have ever read any of the Sherlock Holmes books.  Overall, I just found this movie to be very entertaining, with a good story, some good acting, and good special effects.  Surprisingly, my 9 year old daughter sat down mid-way through the movie, and stated how much she liked it.  So, we went back and watched the whole thing again, and at the end her comment was, ""I LOVE THIS MOVIE!""  So, we're very much looking forward to watching the sequel in the very near future.

All that said, if you are a hardcore Sherlock Holmes fan, you MAY not enjoy this movie as much as we did.  As I said, I am NOT a die hard Sherlock Holmes fan, but I had a couple of friends of mine comment that they didn't really like this movie, but recommended the BBC series instead (also available on Amazon On Demand).  So, I have a feeling the movie may stray a bit from the classic Sherlock Holmes.  So, I am now also going to check out the BBC series as well, but I wouldn't let those comments dissuade you from checking this movie out.

As a note - this is a movie probably best watched in a dark room with the sound turned up.  There are quite a few dark scenes in the movie, and it can be a bit difficult to see in a brightly lit room.  In addition, the characters also whisper / talk under their breath more than usual in a movie.  So, if you're not prepared for that, you may miss what they're saying (some of which is particularly entertaining), especially with British accents.",1360540800,,1653,4.242811501597444

I wouldn't recommend it to children under 13 due to subject matter. I don't remember any vulgarity but there were a couple of instances (of which I can't remember now) where my 13 year old asked ""What does that mean?"", refering to something sexual I believe.

It was nice to see lines or snippets from Doyle's stories make their way into the movie.  The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is wonderfully subtle; the scene with the pair awaiting bail was snicker worthy but also showed the pair's brotherly affection.  Don't expect this movie to hold hard and fast to Doyle's stories but know that this movie does pay homage to Doyle's famous sleuth by dropping actual lines from the tales which the characters either speak or situations they comment on.  Sit back, relax, enjoy this film, then go read the Sherlock Holmes stories.  You won't be disappointed.  Cheers!!  }:O",1359849600,,747,4.975806451612903

2045792,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Guy Ritchie brings his macho stylings and elaborate machinations (but not the inventively clever and profane dialogue) to the classic superhero detective.  Always known for his aloof attentiveness to minutiae, now Sherlock Holmes is also a skilled fighter, capable of putting his keen inferential skills to the task of incapacitating his opponents in hand-to-hand combat.  Watson has also been upgraded, more in keeping with the books than with film and television depictions, to something much more than an assistant and sidekick - in spite of his reluctance and longing for domestic tranquillity, he's a serious fighter, like Holmes, and achieves with effort the insights that Holmes intuits.

It's a classic mismatched buddy formula, that should be familiar from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Odd-Couple/dp/B001PKHS5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Odd Couple</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferris-Bueller-s-Day-Off/dp/B0019GO58W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/0790729695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>, only this time the fate of the world is at stake as an evil supervillian sets his sights on world domination.  The film throughout is a visceral thrill ride, that punches you in the gut but keeps the brain ticking (even if everything gets explained every several minutes in case you weren't paying attention).  In the end it all amounts to not much more than an exciting couple of hours on the edge of the seats, but very few films even deliver that much.  I had fun.

The cyberpunk London is suitably overcast and grimy, the gadgetry and magical accoutrements are plausibly laid out and constructed, most of the characters inhabit their roles nicely, even if they aren't as fully fleshed out as I'd like to see, but Robert Downey, Jr's melancholic charm and bitter wit is amply on display, always fun to watch.  The cinematography works, even if it gets a bit too choppy for my tastes - I expect that from a Guy Ritchie film - and in spite of a few soft spots and gaps the story rolls along nicely.  You can't go wrong with this one, it's a lot of light fun, unless you can't stand the sight of muscled men inventively pummeling one another every few minutes and clever men bickering jealously like an old married couple nearly as often.

On the discs: the package comes with two discs - the Blu-Ray disc with the movies and extras, and a dvd disc with the movie and a digital copy. There are a few featurettes, and a fairly unique kind of director's commentary called ""Maximum Movie Mode"" where the director, Guy Ritchie, comes on to provide details about shots and plot at specific points of the movie.",1358985600,,2852,5.705188679245283

Jude Law is great as Watson--he fits and plays the role to perfection--but Robert Downey steals the show.  He is Sherlock in this movie and this is perhaps my favorite performance of his (at least close!).",1357516800,,376,4.828125

2045883,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I think that Robert Downey has a unique talent for the quirky type of intellect that he plays here.  During the movie one can easily be drawn into the complex and intertwined type of thinking that he displays and it is a wonderful excerise of the brain.
Most entertaining though is the relationship that Holmes has with Watson who as ""partners"" they travel the movie together.  Watson has now brought the Woman of his desires into their relationship.  Yes, they had a very deep and comfortable relationship in mind and spirit that is threatened by the fiance'.  All this makes for good humor as Holmes ""acts up"" at a dinner meeting by displaying the process of reasoning and deduction that paints a not so elegantly dainty and portrait of their newest member to the group.
The story really takes off when Holmes is sort of hired bya Society to help them with their situation.  From here the plots spin up into 3 or 4 separate but carefully intertwined processed that are so artfully managed that the viewer barerly notices the oncoming of an ultimate concussion where all action lines merge into a single event and once again our dear Mr. Holmes is eventually found to be the man on top of the whole monumentious entanglement of Police, the Bad guys, Parlament, Holmes and Company and of course the innocent who is left not actually so innocent by the final scene.",1357171200,,1364,4.666666666666667

2045916,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 action mystery film starring Robert Downey Jr in the leading role of Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law plays the part of Doctor Watson. This is not your typical Sherlock Holmes. This is a grittier, dirtier and darker version that could have been directed by Tim Burton and played by Johnny Depp. As a strictly Sherlock Holmes film it is below par. The wit and the debonair character is sorely missing. Saving grace is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. The special effects and the costumes are quite good. Still not what I expected from Sherlock Holmes film. Since I can not give it a 2+ it ends up attaining a weak 3 out of 5. 3/5.",1357171200,,652,4.441666666666666

2045975,3,B0001Z3TS4,"It has its problems, and sometimes it strays a little too far from the source material.  But it is also tosses fans some nods, such as the bullet holes in the walls, the bulldog (Watson mentions owning one in a novel,mbur never mentions it again).  While Sherlock is rude and a strong fighter, the sort of antithesis to Basil Rathbones character, he is actually much closer to the spirit of the literary Holmes.

My litmus test is Watson.  If he is useless and weak, then the film is probably not close to the story.  In this version, Watson can hold his own.  The films has it's moments where I wonder what the point of it all is, the action scenes can sometime drag, but in the end it all comes together and in the end I was entertained.

That holds true with this one too. The second film is good, but does not continue
the more personal aspects of their entertaining dialogue. Special effects never
compensate for content. Downey and Law are brilliant in their portrayal of their characters.
My only minor complaint is that they have taken the liberty of turning Holmes into a
""Super Hero"" doing the impossible instead of the unlikely as in Doyles writings.
Who better to play an eccentric with a penchant for a 7% solution of cocaine than Downey.
I, for one, am thankful for Downey's success in coming out of his addiction and back into the world
of entertainment with his flair and superb character development in each of his roles.

2046136,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Six Words: High Definition Slow Motion Fight Scene. Those words could earn this movie a perfect score alone. Lots of humor, and action. Great actors performing amazingly as usual. Entertaining from start to finish.",1355270400,,214,5.323529411764706
2046137,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Every so olften along comes a production which flies in  the face of all we hold dear, and then blows us away with it's fantastic story, superb action and acting, marvelous sets and CGI'd effects.  Robert Downey may seem more at home being ""Iron Man"", but his conditioning makes him a formidable Sherlock Holmes as well.  Jude Law makes Doctor Watson seem much more credible, as he should be, and since he is an ex-Army surgeon his decision making must be spot on, or else death takes over!
Fortunately for us there is ample backstory to this film, wherein we can see how the London of the 19th Century was magically restored.  The dialog allows the story to move at a quick pace, but yet does not swamp one with too much detail that obscures or confuses the plotline.  Just the opposite!  Holmes brings everything we need to know to the front, leaving only a few sparse details to be unfolded at the penultimate moment.
I have loved the old Rathbone/Bruce films for years, and can appreciate the following they built for the ""adventures"" of the world's first and foremost forensic detective.  The Jeremy Brett/BBC productions also brought a sharp degree of authenticity to the series of adventures  and like the Rathbone films, these also kept basic adherence to the original Conan-Doyle writings.
What seperates those fine presentations from the one being reviewed here is  cleanliness!  That wonderful time was not the age of antiseptics, clean water, unspoiled food or clean clothes.  Horses littered the streets (along with their undeisrable leavings), drawing the carriages of the day  and hence their passengers, to the desired destinations.  Sewers were just beginning to come into being, not to mention proper indoor toilets.  Truth be known, the Romans had it much better than Londoners did in Holmes original time!  Yes the film is a bit dark, because those were not the brightest of times!  Plague eliminated whole families and classes of people due to the lack of practical hygiene and medicines to deal with unknown pathogens.  As my parents told me about the Great Depression here in America: ""Those were not 'The Good Old Days'!""  So I can aappreciate what the producers went through to see their vision of the time come to fruition.  In my book it succeeds marvelously!  And, if you  like me  find this film outstanding, then be sure to just go ahead and get the 2nd one as well: ""A Game of Shadows"".  And, if you have the proper equipment, get the Blu-Ray versions, as they will reveal a whole other world to the viewer who appreciates the fine details and wonderful atmosphere that make a good presentation WONDERFUL!  Five stars seems too little reward for a film of this stature, but because the stars do not interfere with the movie, nothing is lost.
(P.S.:  I also liked the film ""Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother"".  That should show that I am NOT biased.)",1355184000,3,2878,4.798780487804878

2046159,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Conan Doyle's master sleuth is back in action, and Robert Downey Jr., assisted every step of the way by Jude Law's Watson, is on the case as Holmes, tracking an elusive occultist criminal around, over, and under London.  Meanwhile, deep in the shadows, a more devious character lurks, controlling the puppet strings.

This is definitely an exciting film, and brings new life to the classic detective stories.  Holmes' boxing skills, so often overlooked in the more ""bookish"" interpretations of him, are clearly present, while Watson's role of protector and foil is quite solid.  Remember, this is an adventure film, not a quiet evening read at home.  All the trapping of a modern adventure are present - guns, explosions, chases, the beautiful femme fatale (Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler), the conclusion ripe for a sequel - and each character is engaging in their own way.  If you like Robert Downey Jr., you will love this movie.  If you like Sherlock Holmes stories, you will like this movie, and probably love it.  Brush up on ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" before you see the movie, and you will appreciate it more.

2046161,4,B0001Z3TS4,Loved the movie the first time I saw it 2010. Really like the BluRay edition now. If I can be just a little critical of this first movie it was that the editing was not as crisp as it could have been. The story line was great and the cinematography was outstanding. The editing though had a few scenes where it jumped to quick into another scene. Especially noted was the bedroom scene where Holmes was in the center of the bed. He makes a Holmes like comment and then we go directly to his flat I believe. Again just a small observation. This movie is a solid 4 stars.,1354147200,2,569,4.181818181818182
2046162,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I enjoyed this movie and I thought it was a solid 4 star rating.  The cast and the acting were done very well and made the story along with the action scenes. The teamwork of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) was played perfectly and they looked like old friends in the movie helping each other and supporting each other.

Watson dreams though of a normal life and being around Sherlock always creates too much action and danger.  He is close to becoming married and he wonders how he can juggle a normal life with a wife and have Sherlock as a best friend.  The movie revolves around a gruesome series of murders and finally Sherlock Holmes learns about a new mortal enemy.

After watching, I was happy impressed with the plot twist and the special effects (I really liked the slow motion fight scenes).

2046316,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that, as in the IRON MAN movies, you come away from it thinking ""That's the role he was born to play."" Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job of reinventing the character of Sherlock Holmes, transforming the slim, intellectual Basil Rathbone character into a more muscular, brawling (and obnoxious) fellow who still shines at cracking the mysteries nobody else can with flawless logic and encyclopedic knowledge. Perhaps the worst thing about the movie is Holmes being eclipsed by Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler in the second part of the movie only to have her ollapse into a ""damsel in distress"" at the end. Other than that, the movie is an excellent thriller which manages to keep you guessing right up until Holmes reveals the details of the nefarious plot and sets out to stop it cold. Kudos also for Jude Law, whose Watson is most excellent; Mark Strong, whose evil Lord Blackwood projects insane (yet coldly calculating) menace from beginning to end; and Eddie Marsan as the long-suffering Inspector Lestrade.

It's funny, action-packed, eye-candy with interesting characters and a story that makes sense so there's my case. Meanwhile, film buffs who dig things like commentaries get to watch a unique feature that's part making-of documentary and part commentary as Guy Ritchie visually walks you through the movie.

I read most of the original Sherlock Holmes books years ago so Robert Downey Jr's version took a lot getting used to.  I think he plays a pretty good version of Holmes in his own way but it took some adjusting with how quickly he explained things throughout the film.,1341878400,,540,4.1826923076923075
2046338,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Time flew by for me as I watched this modern reimagining of my favorite fictional detective. Downey Jr.'s Holmes cuts a darker figure than his canonical predecessor, for example employing his significant physical prowess to a much greater extent and having disturbing Holme's girlfriend the governess to the point she threw her wine on him. Holmes cuts a more impressive figure than he does in the canon, proving slightly sharper mentally and physically than Holme's foil in Conan Doyle's writings. I particularly enjoyed the combat choreography, which depicted Holmes fighting in superb modern style, using both Muay Thai strikes and Brazilian Jiujitsu grappling techniques--the overall effect updates Conan Doyle's boxing Holmes to the fighting system a modern virtuoso would use.

I agree with others who say it is entertaining at least.  It's not a very serious representation of Sherlock Holmes. . .or anything. . . but it is a sort of weird over-the-top action comedy hybrid of the famed investigative consultant.

PROS:
- Sherlock doing KungFu isn't as bad as I expected, in fact I liked it.
- somehow this is fun despite your brain telling you that your eyes are watching a stupidly directed movie.
- the comedy is sort of funny, not terrible.
- the story is sort of nonsense, but doesn't cross the line into completely un-salvageable.

CONS:
- gratuitous overuse of extreme slo-mo, especially during explosion action sequences.  Gets boring after a while, becomes more of a filmatic crutch than a dramatic device.
- the 'blending in' camouflage is too obviously CGI faked/assisted-- it is too perfect.  I'd have preferred if this effect was done entirely practical, which would have been more fun since it wouldn't be such a perfect disguise-- fitting in with the other comedic disguise attempts in the film.
- Sherlock seems more capable of fighting than Watson, which I think is out of balance from the original material, and weakens the sense that Sherlock needs an assistant in the first place.

summary:
If Iron Man and Jack Sparrow had a baby and sent it back in time to the 1800's, it would grow up to be this version of Sherlock Holmes.

point of movie: sort of save the world from itself.
kudos: having the guts to jump right into the story, instead of the usual ponderous origin story to explain the character's past history to audience.

2046350,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I badly want to give this marvelously made and wildly entertaining film five stars. But like the master detective, I have to keep my emotions in check and limit it to four. Here's why.

There have been attempts to bring Sherlock Holmes into the 20th & 21st centuries, including the mediocre Basil Rathbone films (which were contemporary out of simple cheapness) and a current British TV series. But the Victorian Holmes is timeless, and needs no updating or re-imagining. Conan Doyle's stories continue to please, not solely because we all love mysteries and Holmes is so deucedly clever at solving them, but because the tales have a fundamental humanity. Doyle had the sense to make them dramas -- stories about the people caught up in crime, both the victim and villain.

Anyone attempting to ""update"" Sherlock Holmes has to acknowledge the British TV series with Jeremy Brett. His is one of the greatest performances by any actor, ever. His Holmes handily transcends Doyle's (in the same way Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" makes the original seem a pale copy). It's an absolute reference, which anyone attempting to ""reimagine"" Holmes ignores at their peril.

The makers of ""Sherlock Holmes"" insist their version is significantly closer to Doyle's conception than just about anything that's come before (ignoring Brett, presumably). This is broadly true -- mostly because Sherlock Holmes adaptations have generally not been very good. As they correctly point out, the Holmes of Doyle's stories is a street-wise actor with an infinite variety of disguises, and an athlete capable of more than holding his own in a scrap. These are usually described after-the-fact in the stories, so actually //showing// them is a pleasing improvement.

Of course, Sherlock Holmes' raison d'etre is, like Spock's, the fact that he //isn't// ""human"". The producers go astray in trying to humanize Holmes, discarding what makes him unique -- especially the ability to strike a vivid contrast with the ""normal"" characters. Though his friendship with and affection for John Watson are real, they are anomalies in his personality. Holmes is a misanthrope, very much aware of his superiority to other people. When he laughs, he's usually laughing at you, not with you.

Despite his placing justice above the law, and sometimes skirting the latter so that the former might better be served, Sherlock Holmes is a fundamentally cerebral and asexual creature. To lower his pedestal closer to the ordinary person -- especially by having him show even faint sexual attraction to Irene Adler (whom, in the canon, he admired because she was close to his mental equal) -- is an unforgivable, incomprehensible error.

This movie's Sherlock Holmes is much too-human, decidedly un-cool when he needs to be at his frostiest, too willing to admit his weaknesses, to a point where we sometimes feel an embarrassed pity. He even shows regret when he hurts Watson's fiancee's feelings. Doyle's Holmes never descended to that level. (Dr Gregory House (whose name plays on ""Ho[l]mes"") is, other than his occasional sex with women, almost equally aloof.) It doesn't help that Downey's Holmes is sometimes downright goofy, an unpleasant reminder of Mel Gibson`s ridiculous performance in ""Maverick"".

The original Sherlock Holmes is sui generis. Any change to his personality is a diminution, not an improvement. Had this film's Holmes been closer to the tougher and chillier Holmes of the novels and stories, I might have awarded it five stars.

The film has other weaknesses, most-notably Rachel McAdams' disastrous miscasting. Doyle's Irene Adler is elegant, intelligent, and a mistress of manipulation. McAdams' Adler is none of these, little more than a bimbo with a spectacular wardrobe. We cannot believe Sherlock would have any interest in her, for any reason.

Jude Law is merely acceptable as Dr Watson. In the stories, he's roughly Holmes' contemporary, but in the film he seems much younger. We expect an experienced human being with some ""gravitas"", but Law doesn't convey that -- especially for someone who served several years in Afghanistan.

Nor is the mystery much of a mystery. Once you've eliminated the impossible -- that the supernatural is real -- what remains is an obvious truth, and the story plays out that way. (What is the point of a master of logic confronting villains with supernatural powers?) At least the sequel is perfectly set-up -- ""guess who"" pulls all the strings in this first film, with a goal quite different from those whom he manipulates.

Sherlock Holmes fans are likely to be //at least// a bit disappointed. (Probably more.) I suggest they simply enjoy this film as a highly entertaining adventure. It can -- indeed, must -- be enjoyed on that level.",1338076800,3,4791,5.145244215938304

A Game of Shadows is one of the most enjoyable films I have watched in years. It is exciting, funny, adrenalin pumping, entertainment from beginning to end. The action never lets up! And Robert Downey Jnr is simply brilliant as Holmes. Downey's dishevelled portrayal is precisely the opposite to what we have come to expect from film makers down through the years, and despite what often comes across as a send up of the famed Conan Doyle character, once you get caught up in the film, all that is forgotten, and Downey becomes Holmes in every sense. Downey as an actor has played some truly memorable roles over the years, & his private life has not always endeared him to film makers. Yet in recent years he has not only regained much of the ground lost by his erring ways, he has come back even stronger, & proven that he is an acting force to be reckoned with, in point of actual fact, one of the finest actors in the business today.

Watson being a fool always made me unconfortable. Brilliant people do not gather stupid people. Fools would gather around themselves stupid people. That way, the fool can appear more intelligent than it he really is.

So Watson being a stupid 30's years old man would depreciate Holmes' brilliance. Successfull people gather around people more intelligent (or at least as intelligent) as themselves. That is the way to be always self-challenged to keep improving.

So a choice of a not-dumb-watson was a challenge. Because as Watson is not a idiot, Holmes hadn't that easy way to shine. Holmes HAD TO BE REALLY briiliant, because none less would impress us when we compare him with a capable Watson.

2046406,1,B0001Z3TS4,"Whether it's a major block buster film, a comical television show, or a re-imagining of a classic series of stories it seems that we Americans can't match our British counterparts when it comes to original entertainment.  This film, while entertaining, doesn't capture the feel or intrigue of a ""Sherlock Holmes"" story; perhaps if it were released 15 years ago, before all the ""twists"" and ""shocking reveals"" were commonplace on basic cable.  I believe this film, and its sequel, could have done just as well (maybe better) if they weren't trying to jump on the Holmes ""mythos.""

If you're a fan of the intrigue and mystery that's the basis of a good Sherlock story, of the ""I didn't see that coming"" and the ""How did they pull that off?"" then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you avoid this film and instead turn your attention to the ""Sherlock"" series produced by the BBC; you know, the company that's based in the traditional home of Sherlock Holmes.

2046407,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Overall, I really liked this movie. As with most movies, there are some things that irked me a bit at first, but nothing that would make me dislike it as a whole. One thing that I especially liked was how this film was different from it's previews and reviews. The previews made it look like an action film and that idea was echoed by the various reviews it received. Many reviews said that this film was nothing like the books. Having read the books, I felt that this was a very good picture of the Sherlock Holmes books; it was not based on a particular book, but it was very similar to their style.
I also thought that Robert Downey Jr. did very well portraying Holmes and that Jude Law made for a good Watson. I was getting tired of seeing versions of the Sherlock Holmes books where Watson was portrayed as a fat and dense sidekick, which was nothing like the books.
Overall, this was a very enjoyable film that is both fun and intriguing. The action is not overdone, the story keeps you interested, and the characters are believable.

As far as questionable content:
The movie stars Rachel McAdams. It seems to be a requirement to have her at least half-naked in one scene in every film she's in. The scene is brief riskiness.
The film also contains some dark scenes involving black magic that might be a bit much for some.

2046416,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I have owned this movie for a long while now and have viewed it many times.  With each viewing I appreciated this movie more for it's 'originality', as a whole new way to look at our beloved Sherlock Holmes; the word here is 'origin'.

I had lent my viewpoint of the super sleuth from the portrayal of him by Basil Rathbone.  Watching movie after movie of Sherlock and Watson over the years done in such a way, I had just taken for granted that this is the way our detective was written also. While studying, the movie really made me wonder; how was Doyle's original interpretation written?  So I went in to crack the books a bit.  I had formed an opinion based on a screen performance through time that isn't altogether correct.

Doyle's books bring to light a multi-layered Sherlock Holmes that would go into the future and not become anything stodgy limited to just one time period.  He is actually an everyman, and one who is steeped in all the knowledge that Guy Ritchie introduced to the audience in this action packed film. I am sure many of us found the Sherlock that we thought we knew to be a polar opposite of the man we see here, although this is Doyle's man of Baker Street.  Guy Ritchie did a brilliant job portraying his lead, Robert Downey Jr., as Holmes and gave Jude Law a new well rounded Watson for us all to see for the first time.

The movie itself hails the duo to be a new ""reintroduced"" vision and in part that is true. ""Sherlock Holmes"" brings to life Doyle's original writing of the books and is far more closely related to this screen adaptation, in my judgment, from studying.  What an awesome surprise for me. Everyone who has read any of the books and/or only has seen the different screen adaptations, keeping those portrayals to reflect the scope of Holmes alone; you must do your imagination a huge favor and introduce Ritchie's everyman super sleuth to yourself again.

Sherlock Holmes is so faceted with tons of nuances shown here in this movie from the novels.  He is so many things all rolled up in one man of action and completely cerebral throughout, a man of then and a man for now.  He is steeped in many realms of thinking, as he is also just as much a defender of those truths.  A bare knuckle fighter and well versed in the martial arts, Doyle wrote him extremely well rounded to be a thinking man of adventure.

Sherlock and Watson explode into this movie, using every trick in the books and show us a very real and exciting duo.  Now that I know how these characters were originally written, I can clearly see that this is an important movie setting the standard back to the original.

I have already seen the second film and thought it far reaching because I didn't do my homework ahead of viewing it. Now I can hugely appreciate this movie as definitely I will watch my judgment of things without knowing the facts first. If you enjoyed this movie as I did, you're in for a real treat with viewing the second film. It is as if you are getting the same Holmes and Watson here plus adding so very much more.

Enjoy the first movie again, perhaps before viewing the second. It is worth a second look with a new perspective and refreshed open mind.",1325808000,12,3193,4.438356164383562
2046417,5,B0001Z3TS4,"The Sherlock Holmes stories were the stories that has spanned my early childhood, they were the ones that stood out, that made impact, and I can honestly say that as an obsessed Holmes story fan, this movie hit all the right notes for me so well, I could watch it again and again.

Was the movie word for word specific to the book? No. Was it perfect? No. But this is simply what it is, an adaptation that has brought the Holmes stories into this new generation and given it a fresh interpretation. It never claimed to be perfect, it never claimed to be all matching the source material, and one should never expect it to be either.

I think generations of people and even readers have got this image of Holmes in a cap and pipe and Watson bumbling around stuck in their heads, an image only perpetuated by the old school classic performances in the various TV and movie adaptations of the past. And it's not to say that those adaptations were not true to Holmes' work or the writing or acting was bad, but I can say that they were never the Holmes and Watson that I had always thought the books were telling me, especially the bumbling idiot sidekick they have made Watson into over the years. And I will admit the thought of another big Sherlock Holmes movie had me very concerned, I was not sure at all. But all my concerns were proved wrong because the movie was exactly what I had always hoped and dreamed for.

There may have been many great performances over the years of Holmes and Watson, but honestly, none of captured the spirit and essence of the characters as well as Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Their chemistry was so vibrant that it leaped off the screen and made their characters even more amazing and real. And I thank to God everyday for someone to FINALLY recognize Dr. John Watson for who he really is, a strong smart intelligent soldier and doctor who may not be a genius but was every bit the partner and companion to Sherlock Holmes. Watson has long been my favorite character, and it breaks my heart every time to see those old school adaptations reduce him to this idiotic foolish existence. Jude Law's performance is the first time in my life of all Holmes things that I felt this is exactly and perfectly the way I had always dreamed it would be. THIS was the Watson I remember from the stories and never saw until now. And needless to say the spark between Jude and RDJ is perfection, their timing was never off from each other, they had each other's backs, they were in sync, always matching, just the way I saw Holmes and Watson to be.

Sure there was more chases and actions and gunshots, but people seem to forget that Holmes and Watson were not just running around using their brains, they were proper fighters who could swing a mean punch as the next martial arts expert too. And to see this through this interpretation was something so refreshingly great about this movie. The characters used their brains, the moments of flashback and montage of the clues were a great way to show them, and they also had a strong balance of brawn to back it up too! Holmes was an expert fighter, and Watson was a soldier for God's sake! Someone had finally took notice!

But more importantly than just dialogue and storyline, what mattered to me was the heart and soul of the characters, and honestly this whole movie could have been about Holmes and Watson watching rabbits hopping and I would have still cheered because RDJ and Jude Law brought these two iconic characters to life and they kept to the spirit of these characters true to their core. And for that, I will forever be grateful to them for doing that!",1325721600,,3639,4.474397590361446

I love Sherlock Holmes, the original Doyle stories, the many pastiches, and the many movies and TV versions.  But this one was hard to love because there was so much in the way of the actual Sherlock Holmes story.  I never saw Holmes or Watson, only these famous movie stars about whom I know far too much personal stuff.  I watched them acting, not the characters.  Irene Adler was misplayed as a cute ingenue rather than as somebody very serious.  How about Sharon Stone or Cate Blanchett?  Watson's Mary Morston had the too-smooth face of a Barbie doll, and supposedly Holmes hadn't met her before, when she actually had met them both on a case.  At least she wasn't perky like their Irene Adler.  The secondary cast seemed like the usual suspects from various Masterpiece Theaters.  The too-many fight scenes went on and on and on.  Holmes definitely preferred to outwit his actual opponents, not beat up the same minor thugs repeatedly.  If we were going to watch fights with the giant repeatedly, couldn't we have given him a real role and character?

The special effects were definitely snazzy, and called so much attention to themselves that they distracted from the story and the characters.  The shipyard scene was almost funny, as was the scene on the bridge.  The magic mumbo jumbo and the science mumbo jumbo were similarly tedious and overstressed, and the usual evil-taking-over-the-world plot is so hackneyed.  If you want to make Sherlock Holmes a superhero, fine, but remember that his superpower is *deduction* of some complicated and subtle murder.

The extras were pretty humdrum -- the usual self-congratulatory chat with the director (oooh, Madonna's former husband!), production people, and the major stars.

So why did I give it three stars?  Downey and Law are lovely to look at, their London is beautiful and gritty, even though much of it looks fake, and I just adore even the suggestion of Sherlock Holmes.",1325635200,,1967,4.920972644376899

On the other hand this movie's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are a reasonably exciting duo with their own set of more contemporary characteristics. Holmes exhibits his famous ability to make important deductions from small clues which causes him to get doused with wine in one scene.

There is enough action including fighting, mystery, intrigue, explosions, and general mayhem to satisfy most fans of the genre so the movie fulfills its obligations in that regard. The villain is suitably dangerous and clever and we even have overtones of Holmes' arch enemy, Professor Moriarty, the consummate villain in the Holmes saga.

She(Adler) uses martial arts to free herself and runs for the door"". But wait, it gets better. ""Holmes, now a true believer in magic, secretly hides the talisman...""

I wanted to love it, but somehow it doesn't quite press all the buttons.

What I will say of it is, although it starts off a jumbled mess, the villain and the plot gradually deliver a very enjoyable film. It's almost like watching a good B-movie, in that there is a lot there to satisfy the mind, but somehow all the interesting pieces do not come together as a symphony.

As a matter of fact, it could be put down to the choice of lead actors. Although the extras make much of the chemistry between the two, somehow Robert Downey's mumbling portrayal of Holmes and Jude Law's ordinary performance of Watson don't quite cut the mustard.
In fact, the supporting cast of Rachel Mcadams (as Holmes' love interest), Hans Matheson (as Home Secretary) but most of all Mark Strong (as Lord Blackwood) outshine the two leads and make you wish that their performances had made for a classic film.

2046495,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I am an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes. I love the original stories by Doyle, having read quite a few of them. And I must say that this film contains the most accurate rendering of Doyle's famous detective I have ever seen on screen. Ever. That's not an exaggeration, either.

The Holmes in Doyle's stories was not just a man of peerless intellect - he was also a boxer, could shoot and fence well, and knew an early form of martial arts. He also had serious bouts with depression, was often unpredictable and blunt, and kept an untidy apartment. It may sound odd, but Holmes was the epitomy of oddness, and this film shows him as such.

The people who complain about this are generally the ones who haven't read the original stories. They're just drawing on what they know from the 1940s feature films starring Basil Rathbone. Not cool. Rathbone is a fine actor, but his representation of Holmes as an austere, ultra-thin brainiac is disappointing at best.

The movie also scores points with its accurate portrayal of Dr. Watson. In the aforementioned TV series, Watson was depicted as a bumbling fool who kept getting in his partner's way. Not so in this film: Watson is a muscular, intelligent Army doctor... just like in Doyle's stories.

Of course, it's not a perfect adaption - I don't think Holmes ever encountered that many explosions and fist-fights during a single case, and the character of Irene Adler is much different than the one Doyle created. Everything considered, however, it's a refreshingly satisfying mix of action, adventure, mystery, and humor.",1324166400,3,1567,4.835820895522388
2046496,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Subsequent of our viewing to ""Sherlock Holmes"" an acquaintance of mine made a rather accurate comparison:  Robert Downey as Holmes and Johnny Depp as Sparrow.  Each character seems to be a comfortable glove for their respective actors; each actor's idiosyncratic performances are strong and charming enough to elevate the quality of the film itself; and each role seems destined to be the only thing to live on in peoples' minds after they leave the theatre.

I think that Guy Ritchie, unlike Gore Verbinski, knew this while pondering over the ""Holmes"" script, and consequently was cautious in picking an ideal crowd pleaser to play his film's lead role.

For those who have yet to speculate as to what I'm implying, I'll lay it out bluntly:  Downey will bewitch you into liking ""Sherlock Holmes"", but his performance is the only pillar this picky, clumsy movie has to support itself with.

Guy Ritchie, best known for his graphic and sly british mobster flicks, benefits from very little familiar territory aside, perhaps, from the slummy settings and modestly stylish throwdowns.  His depiction of Holmes is striking and, overall, genuinely interesting; it would be logical to conclude that Holmes could excel in combat, given his understanding of the human body and its weaknesses.  Logical, sure, if a bit of a cop-out for action in a film that would likely be devoid of such, had it slipped into different directorial hands.

It's a clumsily enjoyable experience at best, and a sloppy mish mash of rushed mystery and hard boiled thrills at worst.  For all the general perceptions that we have for Sherlock Holmes, his supposed genius is realized not by the merely capable script, but by Downey's typically strong performance.

As such, other characters fall to the wayside, and it's a real shame, as Law and McAdams both show considerable effort in keeping up with the star.  Unfortunately, the condensed nature of their roles keeps them from being very flexible - Downey's Holmes is the moneymaker, and the film makes you know that early on.  Mark Strong also falls victim to Downey's shadow, but his villain is shallow enough that, had he even been temporarily given the limelight, little would have likely come from it.

Overall, Ritchie's ""Holmes"" is a competent adventure that's well worth taking, and leaves a gaping hole for a sequel to saunter through.  It's light enough for kids, and just barely smart enough to not insult the source material.",1324166400,2,2458,5.004914004914005

The new interpretation of this classic figure was intriguing and the action and plotlines carried the movie along very nicely.  Robert Downey Jr. made the biggest impression as Sherlock, a man who is just as formidable with his fighting skills as he is with his mind, however, even more dangerous at making people around him think that he is slightly insane, which keeps them at bay.  Jude Law's Watson is sympathetic to his best friend's life, however, all he wants is to have his own, which includes bringing to the table his fiancee, which doesn't make Sherlock a happy camper.  This was a very involved movie and I actually can't wait until SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS comes out.  LOVED IT!!!!",1323648000,2,763,4.664179104477612

First, Sherlock Holmes is an intellectual giant, not a ninja.  I'll leave it at that for the moment, but the casting of Robert Downy Jr. as Sherlock Holmes ranks right up there with casting John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.  There was just no way it was going to work.  Now let me provide full disclosure, I am a Jeremy Brett fan.  He really became the role of Sherlock Holmes, at least as well as anyone has in film, and yes, he had some quirks, but almost all of the quirks of Jeremy Brett were in Doyle's text.  The same can not  be said for the Robert Downy Jr. version of Holmes, who is so utterly unlikable that you almost ask yourself if they were perhaps trying to make a different story altogether.  If that was the case, they should have not called it Sherlock Holmes.  This movie also fails in montage.  Subscribing to the strobe-light theory of action sequences, this seizure-inducing film should be viewed best with pain killers.  I'm trying to find a redeeming quality to the film, but alas, the only thing I think it has going for it is the top hat in the poster promoting the movie.",1322438400,20,1245,4.346320346320346

Having read every book and seen every movie involving Holmes, I don't recall much in the way of gunplay or any other form of violence. The essence of Holmes was his brain....not his brawn, but you would never know if from this trash.

This piece of garbage may appeal to people who know nothing of the original stories and therefore might enjoy the overblown antics in which Holmes and Watson are involved. Frankly, this is one of the few movies I've ever paid admission to and walked out on. I do not own the DVD and would not accept it if it were given to me for free.

Because it has so much action, color, humor, and sound. The main characters are young and fascinating!  Sherlock is the slightly demented genius he should be, Watson has a mind of his own to go along with his deep loyalty to Holmes, and the ladies are beautiful and crafty!  The villains are truly villainous, the story exciting, and the whole movie is fun, fun, fun!  Now, I'm eagerly awaiting the next film; I hope it is as good as the first one!
The blu-ray release is gorgeous, but the sound effects can be overpowering, even though they're appropriate.

2046575,3,B0001Z3TS4,"...which really isn't much of a compliment, I realize, but it's the phrase that keeps coming back to me as I think about this flick.

I'm not dead set against some tweaks to the Holmes character or the Holmes canon, per se, nor do I hate everything by director Guy Ritchie (I didn't mind ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch,"" though I do think his other films are dodgy, at best).  But this movie, while providing a few of the typical ""summer movie"" pleasures (large scale action sequences, etc.), just doesn't feel like anything even close to Sherlock Holmes.

The Pros:
1.  A solid, dependable trio of lead actors who work well together and who seem to have fun.  Much of whatever pleasure the movie provides can be traced back to this element.  Downey, Jr. and Jude Law have real chemistry, and Rachel McAdams continues to be a good sport and a pro, even when provided with limited screen time and material. Frankly, she deserves better.

2. Jude Law. Yes, you could say that I've already covered this point in #1, but I think he bears special mention.  Downey Jr., while fun, isn't really portraying the real character of Holmes (despite what he'd like to you believe in his press interviews).  But Law turns in a fine, entertaining performance that still conveys the real nature of Watson (intelligence, stoicism, and a good nature), and he does so while maintaining a credible screen presence next to his grandstanding co-star.

3. It looks good. In other words, the money is on the screen.  Sets and costumes are all convincing, and London looks wonderfully atmospheric.  Then again, this isn't much of a compliment either (with a budget this big, the film really *ought* to look good).

The Cons:
1.  The movie doesn't feel like Sherlock Holmes.  Sure, you've got characters named Holmes, Lestrade, and Irene Adler, but beyond the literal names and Holmes' token violin, the characters don't feel like the people Conan Doyle described. (Only Watson comes close.) The filmmakers were practically falling over themselves in interviews to convince viewers that this ""was the real Holmes."" Not quite. I don't remember the last time Holmes engaged in *regular* boxing matches, blew up stuff real good, or engaged in such overt sexual flirtation with Adler.  Plus, Holmes has been made much more viewer friendly here.  The literary Holmes was a cold, arrogant, drug addicted genius. This cinematic version is not so much.  This incarnation could (almost) fill in as your smart buddy from down the street...

2.  The plot.  It feels too much like typical, generic summer movie stuff (big explosions, over the top villains, supernatural cults, etc.), and too little like the Victorian - and sometimes idiosyncratic - mysteries of Holmes.

3.  Robert Downey Jr.  Yes, he's a talented actor and has charisma to burn, but - as stated - he's not really playing Holmes. Instead he's essaying same wise-acre persona he always seems to be playing these days.  Basically, he's playing Tony Stark in a Victorian suit.  And while the wise-guy routine isn't unpleasant to watch (and he *does* have the aforementioned chemistry with Law), it's hard to escape the feeling that Downey Jr. is coasting a bit on autopilot here.

So - the end result is that it could have been worse, and the movie is watchable.  But at the end of the day, that still feels like faint praise.",1310515200,2,3351,4.852112676056338

as older men, but once rented, I was hooked! Subsequently, I ordered the Blu-Ray, and don't regret it!
I think the sound editing alone was worth an Academy Award nomination. Also the soundtrack was superb,
with the occasional Middle Eastern music, for effect.
Both Edward Downey jr. and Jude Law were perfect for their parts. By going with the flow, and ignoring
my ""older persons"" concept, I think this film, with the gratuitous supernatural flavor, really rocked!
Two minor flaws, which don't lower my five star rating: Edward Downey jr. would occasionally speak in
a whisper, which I found inaudible. The worst flaw I found, however (correct me, if I'm wrong) is my

chosen to play Adler, with her high pitched voice, has no stage presence at all. I found it interesting,

Downey Jr. does an excellent job at playing Holmes- a rugged intelligence, witty comments, and good acting make for a good character.  I think the character development is one of the best parts in the movie.  Watson (Jude Law) also does a good job at being the reluctant sidekick who tries to be the voice of reason before engaging in investigations.

The story is good and makes you replay the events in the movie (and does a good job of allowing you to attempt to put the pieces together and figure out the mystery).  The movie flows pretty quickly which can be annoying for some and then the film will cut back to reveal how an event took place from a different prespective, but makes for solid explanations.

The problem (one of them) was that the plot was sheer nonsense.  The evil villain, Lord Blackwood, has a plan to take over the world and create an empire! Mwahahahaha ...

Aside from that minor point, the rest of the movie was pretty much dull as dishwater.  Lots of pointless fast action fight scenes, dialogue that was mostly mumbled (thank god), and some silly stuff beween Holmes and Watson (or House and Wilson, if you prefer) that was supposed to be funny, but really wasn't.

I freely admit to being unfamiliar with Sir Doyle's stories, yet I also freely admit the stuffy, stoic, rather wooden portrayal of Holmes in the Rathbone films never floated my boat.  So this version of SHERLOCK HOLMES delighted me, as here Robert Downey Jr. gives the character an edge; here the super sleuth is disheveled, marvelously eccentric, slightly neurotic, totally violent, and, when the case isn't coming along, or just for the heck of it, Downey's Holmes will get high.  And Jude Law is not your grandfather's Dr. Watson; he's curmudgeonly with a suggestion of rogue grit, and he takes particular delight in his friend Holmes's persistent misfortunes.  (As long as he's not sucked in as well.)  The interaction between the two suggests more of a rugby locker room than a London flat with two gentlemen.  And it's fun to watch.

The plot is just silly, Rachel McAdams is misused as bad girl/love interest Irene Adler, and my acute acrophobia made watching the climactic fight scene on the under-construction London Bridge extremely unsettling, but I suffered such inconveniences gladly.  The images of late 19th Century London, the madcap mayhem of Downey and Law (especially when they're pitted against a hulking Robert Maillet in an hysterical fight scene), and Mark Strong as the brooding, evil, sinister villain Lord Blackwood all combined to enhance my enjoyment of this version of SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Will I be watching the soon-to-be-released sequel?  Elementary, my good Watson, elementary.

As for the old ones, I liked the eerie backgrounds that pervaded the movies.  I liked the newer version for more instances of comedy.

The story in the new version was good:  a murderer who wants to take over the world feigns his own death and plots his takeover, starting with the British Parliament.

While the movie was entertaining, I thought it lasted a few more minutes than necessary.  Perhaps around 1.5 - 1.75 hours instead of just over 2 hours.

Thought Robert Downey Jr.  did a good job in the Holmes role.  Jude Law was okay as Dr. Watson.

I do look forward to a sequel if that happens - one is hinted with the mysterious appearance of Professor Moriarity.

We'll see.

I give ""Sherlock Holmes"" 3 stars based on the plot, comedy, and action.  Would like to see more of the eerie and mysterious settings from the old Basil Rathbone movies.

Even the minor characters, like Lestrade and Mary and the fortune-teller and the French giant are standouts.

But it's really the plot and the direction that shine.

The introduction of the occult is brilliant.

And the intense physicality is superb.  Against the gray and brown dullness of the Edwardian backdrop, the characters' constant ACTION is like bright colors.  (The only other bright colors are, appropriately, on Rachel McAdams's wardrobe.)  These quite often erupt into real colors: the explosions, the pigs, the weapon of mass destruction, the flashing fire of electricity.

If you are however, a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes stories this move is for you.

He took Holmes back to his roots as someone that wasn't afraid to get into fights, got melancholy and did drugs when he didn't have cases (yes he really did do this in the books), and have a slightly supernatural feel to the movie, but still grounded in reality.  It's classic Holmes and Robert Downey Jr. played him expertly.  Jude Law was a great companion and together the two provided an absolutely entertaining, thrill a minute movie.  You can't go wrong with this movie....I just wish they had a two disc version of the film with some special features :)",1302566400,2,928,4.662576687116564
2046640,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Short version: BBC's ""Sherlock"" is WAY better.

As far as this film goes, I had the same reaction to it that I had to ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.""  I say that in the mindset that I am a solid Harry Potter fan as well as a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories of the famous detective.  Guy Ritchie and his team had a clear and justifiable direction in which they wanted to take the film; they claimed to want to tell a grittier, more action-oriented story, with suspense that actually pulled you into the action, rather than simply observing it from afar.  He claimed to do so by eliminating the many stereotypes associated with Holmes and his adventures on 221B Baker Street.  Or, rather, take things back to before those stereotypes  formed.  Ritchie's intentions were honorable and, in some parts of the movie, they worked wonderfully.  In others, however, they didn't.

To put it bluntly, the good was very good and the bad was very bad. The overall character of Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jr., was believable, right down to his mannerisms and accent. Meanwhile, I marveled at the entire character development of Irene Addler. They turned her into a full-blown criminal and modern-minded woman, rather than the sophisticated woman she really was in Doyle's book.  Yes, I say that book, singular, on purpose. Addler only appeared in one short story; and, in that short story, she and Holmes were NOT in love, nor was it ever implied.  She merely bested him at his own game - the only person, let alone woman to do it - and he respected her for it, which is significant since Holmes did not respect women in general.

On another side of the playing field, the production design was fabulous, while their use of anachronistic devices was staggering, from the misuse of the phrase ""down the rabbit hole,"" to the extravagant (often unnecessary) fight sequences.  The writing was well-written for the most part, as far as dialogue went, and yet I did not care for all the mystical, voodoo, magical...stuff they used in the story. It set the wrong tone as far as I was concerned, a tone too different from that of the books. And yet, in and of itself, it worked cohesively. I just didn't like it much.

However, the fact that they introduce Professor Moriarty at the end of the film leaves me far more interested in the inevitable sequel than I had in this, first, film.  Moriarty has been defined, even in this film, as a character who exists in the same intelligent, detail-filled real world reality in which Holmes, himself, lives. Plus, that final scene when you get the feel for what's next, for the lead-in to Moriarty, that was straight out of Doyle's work, for me.

Things I did like were the mentions of Microft (Sherlock's older brother), Inspector Lestrade as an active character in the film (didn't much care for the actor, but the character's presence was great) and the fact that Moriarty's hands were covered by the classic black gloves and that his briefcase had the ""M"" on it. Excellent details.

So, overall, I'm about 50/50 with it, and looking forward to the next installment.
But I am FAR more eager to see more episodes of ""Sherlock"" on the BBC.",1302393600,3,3193,4.683363148479428

So I purchased it, watched it and in the end, was very pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. Like many, I'm an old-school Sherlock Holmes fan. I've read all of Arthur Conan Doyles stories and novels. And I think the mood and setting in those stories is distinctly awesome. I'm also aware of the tradional way in which Holmes has been portrayed in movies over the years. I say, hold on to that traditional view, but open yourself up for a new and fun interpretation of the Holmes mythos. Yes. The characters appear to be somewhat different than the way in which you may have imagined them. Yes. The setting may be a little more wild that you pictured. But in the end, that is what is so appealing about this movie. Downey Jr. and Law play characters that inhabit an alt. Holmes universe. It's supposed to be a little off-kilter than what you might have expected. However, there is a good story here, with good villains, interesting twists, and excellent cinematography. This is another movie that just looks fantastic on your HD TV. And the best thing is that once you get used to it, you realize that  this movie sets itself up nicely for a sequel.

2046654,4,B0001Z3TS4,I agree with those reviewers who feel that this film is more successful in its characterizations of Holmes and Watson than the Rathbone/Bruce films so popular years ago. I'm always happy to see a Holmes film that does not make Watson the bumbling idiot that Bruce did so well in those tributes to Conan Doyle's favorites.  The Jeremy Brett series also does a great job at showing Watson to be a truly valuable associate that Holmes really does rely on quite a bit on several occasions.  I still have to admit that I adore Basil's Holmes without a doubt but was extremely satisfied with Downey's take on the man also.  I loved the chemistry between Downey and Law and would love to see more of them together in these roles. I thought Mary Morstan was not very well portrayed but there's not a whole lot to go on as far as her personality in respect to her and Watson as a couple though of course she is their first client in the stories.  The Irene Adler angle was cute and I feared they would let the sensuality go too far with she and Holmes and it did come close but luckily the movie makers backed off before they had officially blown it.  Sherlock would never let himself become distracted over a female - not even a hot one.  He's polite and often kind to women where appropriate but he does not dwell on them in any other way - including Irene.  He's impressed with her intelligence and respects her for it.  That's all!  But we must allow Guy Ritchie some leeway and some fun here and he does it without disrespecting our heroes original image. I thought Jude Law was tremendous - can't overstate that here - and Downey was funny and clever though I would have liked to have seen him do more of what we love Holmes for (the facts from small items) without so many of the small facts being so contrived.  I wish they hadn't made the supernatural an aspect of this - even though the explanations are based on truths and not on metaphysical mumbo jumbo - it still was a bit of a sell out and I wish mysteries in general would avoid the Scooby Doo themed stuff.  (Except when it is Scooby of course).  I loved the music and the art theme and creative direction in this movie. Mark Strong is scary and unattractive as the bad guy (wow - Mr. Knightley sure looks different huh?).  Oh and love the fact that the script made a point of mentioning Mycroft (Sherlock's older bro).

2046659,3,B0001Z3TS4,"When this movie was announced, I was thrilled to bits and very excited. As a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, here was a legitimate big screen adaptation of the brilliant works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Guy Ritchie is a highly capable director (Snatch and Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were extremely enjoyable movies) and Robert Downey Jr was coming off of Iron Man. December arrived and the movie opened very well. By the time I got to seeing it (on BluRay)it was a big hit worldwide. After all this hype and expectation, the movie definitely disappointed.
It is not as if the movie sucked. In parts, it was fun. In parts, it was intriguing. But as a whole, it lacked the thrill and mystery that Holmes evokes. The Jeremy Brett Holmes brought an intensity that was sorely lacking in Downey. The steampunk sets were cool but somewhere in the big budgets and even bigger stars, A.C.Doyle was lost. The humor was OK but forced. The action was fine by Hollywood standards and it will satisfy the non-Holmes background viewers who come looking for an actioner.
I miss my Granada TV production Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes whose eyes sparkled and body twitched for action. The mystery was his to solve and the charm of Victorian England was there everywhere. Sometimes, keeping this simple helps and works too. The big screen Holmes has everything, just a little too much of it.",1300838400,7,1373,4.7489539748953975

This movie has a plot too, which is something because usually action packed films have little to none plot whatsoever. I don't know about you guys but when I picked this movie up, I wasn't expecting something out of LOTR or an Oscar winning material film. I was expecting a movie that delivers ""Pure Entertainment"" just to have some fun watching it and this movie didn't fail me. I was actually expecting it to be worse because everyone was talking about how good it is and I'm always suspicious of Hyped movies they almost always turn out to be ""overrated"" but this film was not thankfully !

The City of London is going through a series of unexplained, weird events that is causing mysterious deaths and other incidents too. The problem ? They can't blame it on the villain who was a supposed wizard because he is already dead. Then who is behind all these crimes ? Leave it to our favorite Smart, witty and sarcastic detective and his best friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law) to find out. However, Holmes must get kicked in the a$$, get into arguments with his best friend and confess old enemies before he solve the mystery.

I've read all of the Holmes ""canon"" so that no doubt colors my opinions. I always identified with Watson (which I think was Doyle's intent) so I am positively disposed toward any adaptation that depicts Watson as more than a buffoon a la Nigel Bruce. This film really delivers on this front. Watson really holds his own against Holmes here. Holmes and Watson are tailor made for a ""buddy"" movie and this film really shows that.

The movie is almost perfectly cast. Downey and Law are superb, but Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and Eddie Marsan are terrific also. Mark Strong is perfectly adequate but was somewhat overshadowed by the mysterious (and uncredited) Moriarty.

The plot was fine, with action sequences that were well choreographed without being over the top. But it isn't all action. Holmes' deductive powers are amply tested. The DVD came with a comic book/storyboard that was used to sell the project. I can only be grateful that the story was changed to rationalize the supernatural elements. Sherlock Holmes is not a vampire hunter, exorcist, etc.

Summing up I really enjoyed this film and am pleased a sequel is in the works. Sherlock Holmes is one of the enduring supermen of English literature. He is treated with the appropriate respect here. Highly recommended.",1299628800,,1391,5.008658008658009

2046680,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I quite enjoyed the film but, in part, for reasons that have to do with past and present politics.  The mysterious and powerful 'Lord Blackstone' is the leader of a secret society that has an obvious resemblance to the Masons.  Together, and through the ceremonies/rites of this society, he has a sinister plan to take over England, America and eventually the entire world.  His plan, amongst other things, involves corrupting the police and other institutions.  Blackstone will, of course, be the literal dictator--King, Emperor--of the entire Earth and will rule by fear.

There is a fascinating political tract written by a mysterious individual supposedly named 'Nilus' and published in 1906.  The title is 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' [Available on Amazon].  The tract--almost certainly fraudulent--claims to be nothing less than the minutes of a French conference of Masonic Jews and details a plan to take over the World creating a one world state.  The mechanisms for doing this will include the insidious and subversive corruption of our institutions--police, courts, media, politicians.  Monetary manipulation and instability is an important part of the plan.  The terrified and demoralized masses will welcome the peace and stability that comes from the leadership of a benevolent, and all powerful, 'King' who will be chosen by a cadre of 'Wise Men.'

The similarities to Blackstone's sinister organization are, I think, obvious and makes me suspect that the writers of 'Sherlock Holmes' are intimate with Nilus tract.  By the way, I DO NOT believe that 'Protocols' are the actual minutes of anything, let alone the minutes of a subversive Masonic organization with Jewish guidance.  On the other hand, many of its assertions and predictions are alarmingly accurate.  I don't know who actually wrote 'Protocols' but, whoever they were, they definitely wanted to get their message out to the world.",1297468800,2,1915,5.2772277227722775

If you think of it in this way you can enjoy it for what it is and not be disappointed if you are a fan of the Holmes series of books. This follows Holmes and Watson as they investigate a series of murders linked to a black magic order and although the plot is a little weak in places it still has plenty of thrills and spills to keep you entertained. Both Law and Downey Jr play their roles well, even if there does seem to be a distinct homosexual undercurrent to their relationship and they make a good crime fighting team. The actress whom plays Watson's love interest is rather wooden and lacking in any real dynamic, but this cannot be said for Holmes love interest (played by Rachel McAdams) who plays her role with a touch of humour and real spark. The London scenes are very good and this is quite an atmospheric film. This came across initially like a martial arts film set during the Victorian era (in fact one of the extras on the disc focuses upon this aspect) and the fight scenes are both comical and action filled. This film is most definitely made with tongue in cheek and doesn't take itself too seriously and whilst it is blatantly set up for a sequel, in this instance I eagerly await what they will do with this franchise. This is a light hearted, period set action film and it carries this off with aplomb and makes for an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.

Downey and Law have some good chemistry with each other which is a lot better than the relationship between Holmes and Rachel McAdams as the pick-pocket Irene Adler. Didn't director Guy Ritchey remember her from Red Eye?

If you are a Sherlock Holmes purist, you will probably not enjoy this action-adventure version and should stick with the BBC productions.

This is not an origin story. The story picks up as if you should already know everything about the characters. If that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. Don't expect every character trait to be explained or every relationship's past to be explored.

However he nailed that role beautifully.  I was shocked even more when he was later hired to play Sherlock Holmes.  However he is terrific here as well.
Lets face it, this is no Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone.  Holmes is young, athletic and able to mix it up with the best of them.  Jude Law is a different Watson than we have ever seen as well, he is also inclined to shoot first or get involved in fisticups and ask questions later.  One of today's prettiest and charismatic young actresses, Rachel McAdams, is a pleasure to watch as Irene Adler and after this film and ""Robin Hood,"" Mark Strong is the ultimate British villain.  The plot is totally wild and often incomprehensible.  The action scenes are great and there is an even Oddjob-like villain's stooge to throw Holmes and Watson around in several very well-staged action scenes.  The sets and production values are lavish and wonderful to look at, the money this film cost is all up there on the screen. The music by Hans Zimmer also adds to the excitement and is fascinating to listen to.
The picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.  There are several special features on the making of this film, however they are much shorter than the special features I've seen on many other blu-ray films.

Downey Jr does a very good British accent and his portrayal of Holmes is spot-on, ranking up there with Basil Rathbone (yes, THAT Basil Rathbone) while Law's Dr. Watson differs from Nigel Bruce's endearing (but comically inept) Watson, which is in keeping with the way Sir Arthur wrote Watson. Rachel McAdams was perfect as Irene Adler, the only person to outwit Holmes, and Mark Strong is chilling as Lord Blackwood, the mysterious enemy behind a nefarious plot to destroy the world.

Jude Law does a strong job as Holmes' sidekick, Watson.

But the film is an egregious failure for three reasons. One, it's too long and should have been edited down by at least twenty minutes. Two, there is a conflict of tone: Gothic vs. cartoonish. The film's darkness is contradicted by Downey evading his adversaries like Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner. Had the film gone for pure darkness, it probably would have been more effective.

Another colossal failure in the film was its main villain, the satanic Lord Blackwood played adequately by Mark Strong. The Blackwood role is neither developed or scary. Without a compelling evil force and without a consistent gothic tone, the film feels at times ridiculous and ultimately the viewer becomes, in spite of Downey's immense talents, disengaged, bored, and disappointed that such a great talent as director Guy Ritchie's has been squandered.",1293840000,5,1256,5.033653846153846

2046725,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Bottom-Line:  In the final analysis I thoroughly enjoyed this freshly minted version of ""Sherlock Holmes.""

Some might say that the tried and true story of Sherlock Holmes should not be trifled with, that the legendary Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale needs no refreshing from the masterful(?) storytellers in Hollywood.  But they would be wrong.  As told through the lens of director Guy Ritchie, and the acting chops of Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law, this (new) ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) is a worthy tale indeed.

Story-Line

Directed by (Guy Ritchie ~ Swept Away, Revolver), ""Sherlock Holmes"" follow the exploits of the able detective portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Gothika), and his more than able sidekick Dr. Watson portrayed by Jude Law (Cold Mountain, Closer, Enemy At The Gates) as they corner and capture Lord Henry Blackwell (Mark Strong ~ Body of Lies, Robin Hood, Babylon A.D.) who is murdering young women in pursuit of him black magic.

After his capture the Lord is sentenced to hang, and hang he does and is pronounced dead by Dr. Watson, only to reappear later in the story and become the nemesis Holmes chases.  But only after an old flame, one Irene Adler, portrayed by Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers, Red Eye) reappears in Holmes life bringing with her a mission and duplicity.

Lord Black soon reappears, is quite alive, and has hatched a plan to murder and control, and so begins the saga...

My Thoughts

As directed by (Guy Ritchie ~ Swept Away, Revolver), ""Sherlock Holmes"" the story and the man take on a decidedly dark turn.  Gone is the dapper, proper, prim, detective we have all come to associate with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, replaced by a profoundly intelligent if decidedly dour Holmes.  Not that I totally dislike this Holmes, if anything he is more human than the Holmes of old, more fallible, more approachable and dare I state believable, but do we want our Holmes to be so human?

Jude Law portrays Dr. Watson to type; he is the opposite of Holmes; e.g. he is classy and very much the English gentleman Holmes is not.  In this adaptation of the classic tale Holmes is an accomplished fighter given to street fighting in order to hone his skills.  These fight scenes are very well thought out and orchestrated; the director fist plays the episode out in slow motion with Holmes plotting out every strike and its effect on his adversary.  We are then treated to the scene in real time as Holmes dispatches him hapless foe with skill and aplomb.  Loved it!

McAdams somehow look out of place in period garb.  Perhaps it's her sharp feature and rather pallid completion that do not lend themselves to the period; whatever the reason, she was not convincing as Holmes' soft foil, his ex-lover with a grudge; she is just too young.  A more mature woman like Rachel Weis, or the always delectable Gweneth Paltrow would have been more fitting and believable.

In the final analysis I thoroughly enjoyed this freshly minted version of ""Sherlock Holmes.""  While I do wish our English hero was portrayed a little closer to type, Robert Downey Jr.'s rather eccentric portrayal is not without merit and gravitas.  Yes, I would have gone in a different direction than Ms. McAdams for the female lead, but the choice of Jude Law for Dr. Watson was spot on.",1293062400,3,3328,4.788091068301226
2046726,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Can't add much to the positive reviews already resident on this excellent story featuring Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law.  Entertaining sums it up for me!  This is one of those movies where you can test yourself to see what you see (and what you don't) in trying to keep up with the clues provided!  I finally broke down and bought the DVD.  It's currently in rotation on HBO.  Now, I can watch it when I want!

My favorite scene is where Sherlock Holmes gets with a gypsy woman to tell Watson's fortune.  He's sucked in, but after awhile he figures out that he's been had, but the lines that crack me up are:

Gypsy woman: (the gypsy woman is referring to Watson's fiancee, Mary in this exchange) Oh, she's got a beard, and, oh, she's covered in warts!!

To which Sherlock Holmes deadpans:  Are they extensive??

That scene cracks me up everytime I watch it (and I've seen this move 20 times already, before I purchased the DVD)!

I can't wait for the sequel!  Robert Downey strikes gold again in this role. Kudos are also due the special effects in restoring turn-of-the-century London, down to the construction of the London Bridge, with it's combination Suspension/Cantilever design (a first, I believe)!

2046728,3,B0001Z3TS4,"One of those really bad ideas that surprisingly turned out rather well, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes doesn't entirely work but offers enough fun along the way for that not to matter that much. Feeling at times like one of producer Joe Silver's projects for his Dark Castle horror label before the budget escalated, it pits a two-fisted Holmes against a supernatural adversary who has risen from the grave (not the first project to have the idea: Holmes was due to take on Dracula in a rival project at Columbia, and it's perhaps not accidental that Mark Strong's Satanic villain is played as a cross between Dracula and Himmler). The emphasis is on action and comedy rather than sleuthing and intellect, but when a film includes a spectacular setpiece where a giant henchman destroys a shipyard and knocks down a ship (not a boat, a full-sized ship!) in an attempt to crush the world's greatest consulting detective it's hard to complain that you're not getting your money's worth. It's certainly no surprise that while the slew of Homes films over the past century have usually been reliable but modestly financially successful earners, this is the first to do real blockbuster business: it's a crowd-please and no mistake.

While it's good to see the trend of giving Watson his due as a man of action and intelligence continuing here, Holmes doesn't come over quite so well despite Robert Downey Jr's best efforts, the script generally limiting his deductive reasoning to evaluating the most effective way to beat an opponent (not entirely out of keeping with Doyle's stories) with too many of his other conclusions rather too elementary to convince us of his genius. Even a scene where he improvises one of his disguises from items he finds on the street doesn't work as well on screen as it probably did on paper. Instead the emphasis seems more on a Withnail and Watson approach to the mismatched flatmates that offers some amusement but never really takes hold as well as the BBC's engagingly ingenious modern-day updating in Sherlock. Nor does Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler really work here, never given a real chance to demonstrate the genius that made her the only adversary to beat Holmes in favor of a bit on Unresolved Sexual Tension bickering rivalry.

The real star of the film is the city of London itself in the age of Empire, which assumes centre stage as setpieces are set around shipyards, a half-built Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and London's Docklands when they still were docks, and very vividly realised it is too on a scale previously undreamt of. The CGI may not always be 100% convincing and its flaws are magnified on the small screen, but if it had been attempted in an earlier age it would have required model shots and matte paintings that would have required a similar suspension of disbelief. Best of all is the was the film manages to weave the director's love of London lore into the fabric of the action, setting in the most vividly realised depiction of the disparity between the Empire's corridors of power and it's barely working class underbelly since Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade.

A great Holmes film? Certainly not. But for the couple of hours it's on it's far more entertaining one than we probably had any right to expect.",1292716800,2,3297,4.831858407079646
2046729,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Hollywood (and elsewhere) has given up many interpretations of Arthur Conan Doyle's master detective (and ace companion, Doctor Watson) since the time of the acerbic, arch, understated Basil Rathbone days along with a bumbling Doctor Watson in the 1930s. Since then, depending on the times, he has been everything from a ""hippie"" dope fiend to the the present protean man performance by Robert Downey, Junior. In an age when every action film has to meet the Iron Man comic book standard, or better, it is, apparently, no longer possible to portray the magi of Baker Street as a stay-at-home bookish intellectual and mere man of scientific deduction. He must now also be the avenging angel (and old Doc as well), well versed in the martial arts and other forms of self-defense against the criminal element and in this film the besieged British Empire.

Now normally I would not review this kind of film, although I am always happy to watch anything that Robert Downey, Junior has a part in. He is just a very interesting actor to watch in the line of Humphrey Bogart, Paul Newman, Jeff Bridges and the like. I, of course, thrilled to Conan Doyle's stories ever since grade school where the teacher recited aloud Hounds of The Baskervilles to us. And I have read plenty of his other stories but usually the story line is nothing worthy of comment. This one, however, is slightly different.

Our finely-honed and alert pair in this caper are trying fend off the attempts by one Lord Blackburn to create an evil (of course) world-wide Empire and take control of the world's resources. Hey, wait a minute this is mid-19th century England where the Britain Empire ruled the waves. Hello, that was the evil empire. Just ask the average India peasant or those in about fifty other places. And the way the evil Lord intended to reign (poor old Victoria be damned) is through what appears to be something like a ""Rump"" Parliament that seems to have some historic reflection back to Oliver Cromwell's times. Now I know the British monarchy and its myriad supporters never got over that ""interloper's"" transgressions but this is sublime, indeed. Naturally, the ever-hovering background presence of evil incarnate, Professor Moriarty, is wovened into the plot as well. So you can see what I have taken the time to write up a couple of sentences to review this film.

But here is my real problem with the story line. Now, traditionally, old Sherlock is not known, to be enamored of the ladies, although not a few have swooned over him. No time for that stuff, old boy, right? Here though he seems to have a certain feeling for one very fetching villainess, and he coyly leaves her own devices. So what if she was Professor Moriarty's agent. I told you she was fetching, real fetching. In the parlance of the spy game you could have ""turned"" her into a double agent. Sherlock wake up.",1292630400,2,2870,4.759036144578313
2046730,3,B0001Z3TS4,"As some reviewers have noted, this Sherlock Holmes is more faithful to Conan Doyle's original.  Fair enough, but it is shot in a style that is more appropriate for video game players than traditional viewers and readers.  The genre is action/adventure cum crime and detective fiction and the dialogue (as in the Benedict Cumberbatch Holmes) is delivered with breathless rapidity.  Many will cry out for subtitles, but by the time you would have been able to read them the camera would have moved on to the next scene (or scenes).  Ritchie's film is visually stunning at many points.  I don't mind the CGI; the image of the city with Tower Bridge under construction is fantastic.  The atmospherics are superb.  However, the soundtrack may be one of the most annoying and grating ever created.

The story is vague, but Holmes explains it all at the end.  There is also a lot going on: an evil lord set out to beat the hangman and take over the world; plants, nostrums, diabolical devices, a love interest for Watson, a love interest/competing criminal for Holmes and, in the background, off camera, the looming Moriarty (with a little professorial chalk on his lapels--Ritchie doesn't lack a sense of humor).

Of course with any classic, there will always be those who get upset by changes and this version certainly has some interesting transitions from previous versions of Sherlock Holmes. Yet this physically strong and active Holmes may relate more to the original intention of the author Doyle than more cerebral versions. We see a Sherlock Holmes that is physically fit, clever, practitioner of martial arts. Just as Holmes has been changed, so to has Dr. John Watson. Jude Law plays a handsome, clever, loyal, intelligent, physically active, virile Dr. Watson. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Sherlock Holmes and Rachel McAdams is in top form as Irene Adler, the criminal love of Holmes' life. Downey plays Holmes as brilliant and yet overextending. He plays him as clever but trouble prone. His Holmes is funny, sarcastic, and egotistical. Mark Strong is an excellent and diabolical Lord Henry Blackwood, supported in his crimes by Lord Coward, played by the handsome Hans Matheson. Lord Blackwood is a demonic power crazed murderer intent on world domination and of course Holmes is out to outsmart him. One amazing actor was Robert Maillet, a giant who plays the monstrosity Dredger, a giant human killing machine.

But a lot of people don't actually realize this is exactly how he is pictured in the book. They even perfectly mimicked the fast-paced, back-and-forth conversation style between Holmes and Watson that is seen in the original fiction. Holmes was also indeed a drug-addict, something they only hinted at in the movie. This movie was also incredibly exciting to watch, and to pull this off while perfectly holding the true image of Sherlock Holmes is something I don't expect, but am glad to see with a modern film. If you love the classic tales of Sherlock Holmes, then you will love this movie. I personally can't stop watching it.",1290729600,2,927,4.910828025477707

I simply couldn't grasp the plethora of action scenes in what is supposed to be a detective film. I'm not saying it should be boring, but turning Sherlock Holmes into Rambo is just ridiculous. The entire first 40 minutes are composed of actions scenes. This is typical Guy Ritchie nonsense.

I expected an intricate, tense and mysterious detective film with plot changes that would make your head spin - after all that is what Sherlock Holmes is all about - but all I got was Rambo with a bit of detective skills. I would definitely not recommend this. Rent it once and forget about it - shouldn't be too difficult!",1289952000,2,693,4.580645161290323

2046738,2,B0001Z3TS4,"The biggest issue I have with `Sherlock Holmes' is that it tries to explain too much at the films climax that it comes off rather silly and pretentious and un-enjoyable.  Here's the deal; I totally understand that Sherlock Holmes is all about the little details, but when those details are so well shielded from everyone else that the conclusion makes the audience scratch their head in utter bafflement it loses all of its credibility.

Seriously, they would have been better off sticking with the supernatural aspect of the film, no matter how `un-Holmeslike' it really was.

To top everything off, the film is far more interested in showy displays of slick paced action than really building the mystery needed to keep this franchise alive (yes, franchise, since the script was obviously written with a sequel or two in mind).  The CGI sequences range from intriguingly crafted to messy and cheap looking.  The action also takes the audience out of the real story here, and when all is revealed it seems like an epic letdown.

The acting is decent at best, with Jude Law once again proving to be the best thing about the movie he is in (this guy is rather brilliant).  Robert Downey Jr. is kind of messy here and uninteresting (how did he win that Globe????) and the usually mesmerizing McAdams is dreadful and Mark Strong is nothing more than a stereotype (this guy has a ton of promise, but he's been reduced to a sad afterthought for most his features).  The one glimmer of greatness was in Kelly Reilly, who is chucked to the wayside for big explosions, but her dinner scene with Watson and Holmes is stunning.

I wish Richie were smart enough to use her more.

I want to talk for a second about Guy Richie because I actually really like his directing style.  I think that the gritty humor he laces his films with is spectacular.  I actually think he should have been Oscar nominated in 1998 for his work on `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'; it was that good.  Sadly, `Sherlock Holmes' is almost too polished.  It loses the gritty realism that Richie brings to his action flicks.  It has his usual quick pace, but it is too crisp for its own good.

The story is a tad messy and incoherent, but that could have been forgiven had the ridiculous `explanations' been reworked (I like the whole `I never saw that coming' aspect of films, but Holmes rambling at the end of this film sounded like he pulled it out of thin air, it was that preposterous).  It could have been so much better.

I kind of hope the sequel never gets made.",1288569600,4,2537,4.587583148558759

2046741,5,B0001Z3TS4,"When I initally heard about this film, I was under the impression that it would have been another one of those dry starchy Sherlock Holmes films, so I decided to skip on it, that is of course until I got the real scoup on it. When I saw it I must admit, I was blown away. I had to watch the final fight scene on the bridge about 20 times. It is that intense, complex and tricked-out, you can't really absorb it in a single viewing.

This movie breaks all the rules for the typical Sherlock Holmes film; Here he is presented not only with a sharp intellect for solving mysteries, but also with a deadly clinical accuracy when in all out fight. Not only is he able to predict his enemies attacks, but is able to counter effectively delvering the right measure of damage to keep is opponent off the scene for the time that he requires.

The film takes you on a rollercoaster ride with the action. Slick sceenplay editing provides some misdirection and keeps you guessing and raises the level or intrigue.

The 1890 London sets are surreal and the costumes are superb. No details seem to have been missed here. The music for this film, which is quite unsusal, also sets the mood marvellously well, I actually purchased this sound track.

The bad guy, Lord Blackwood, is as slippery as a wet snake, and has his full bag of tricks and gives Holmes and Watson a very good run for their money.

Not only is SH made into a boxer and street fighter, but he is something of a rebel rake.  This goes against my memories of him as an austere Victorian who survived and thrived by his wits more than his fists.  Also, perhaps I am getting old, but I have absolutely no recollection of what the caper was, which is a sure sign (to me) that it failed to engage me in the slightest.

2046764,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Most of the reviews of this movie seem to center around whether or not this Sherlock Holmes is true to the original Conan Doyle stories, and on that count it seems more than fair to say both ""yes"" and ""no."" The movie's makers emphasizing the more scintillating aspects of Holmes' personality, such as his skill as a fighter and his selective lack of social graces. To what degree these traits are present in the stories, etc. etc. will be endlessly debated, I am sure. Regardless, it seems that Ritchie selected the character traits that interested him most--and that were most suited to a fast-paced action movie--and put the emphasis on them. That said, it was fun to see some of the less-often depicted aspects of Holmes' personality on display, and I don't discount the movie's portrayal.

With a decent duo established, the movie, however, fails at the plot. The frenzied, often incoherent story threatens to become tiresome as the movie wears on. The frantic pace of the movie coupled with a rather unbelievable plot (to take over the world, no less) made the entire premise unbelievable. So a generally believable, if exaggerated, version of Holmes, with a sturdy Watson, ends up suffering from overproduction and lack of attention to plot, both at the script level and in the frenetic editing. For a mystery, that's a big problem to overcome.

The CGI London, period design, and costumes were all delicious eye candy, and they and the actors made the movie enjoyable, but I came away wishing that--within the stylistic and character choices taken by Ritchie and the actors--the movie had been able to control itself a bit more and in so doing present a more sensible villain and plot to its audience. The different version of Holmes is refreshing and interesting (if debatable), and it would have been nice to have seen him tackle a more thought-out mystery, even at the expense of an action sequence or two.",1287360000,4,1916,4.856269113149847
2046765,5,B0001Z3TS4,"This movie was a lot of fun to watch, I've seen it twice now and I'll definately be having friends over to watch it again with me now that I know all the secrets of Blackwood's magic.  With the character of Holmes in mind I think R.D.Jr is a good fit for him, it's believable that if there was a modern day sherlock holmes his personality might be something down the Robert Downey roles.  Watson's skinnier than I remember him from the old books/movies, but just as composed and seemingly fed up with Holme's social skills as everyone else in the movie is.  Watson wants a life and wife of his own but can't just leave his friend to do all the crime fighting by himself.

There's enough explosions, shooting, and fist-fighting that encompass the adventure to make it a worthy action flick, but with the name Sherlock Holmes you know you'll be ""on the case"" just as much as the characters are with a mystery that ties most of the movie together.  I found the dialouge hard to understand at first, Holmes and Watson exchange words quickly when you are introduced to them, so put subtitles on until you think you've got what they're saying down.  After that watch them solve a sphinx riddle and narrowly escape a trap that reminded me of a ""Saw"" scene based on how it was designed.

I waited for the price to go down a bit, new blu ray movies are all really expensive, and the good ones taken even longer, so finally a year later after it came out I find it a great looking blu ray movie and a welcome addition to my collection.

The cinematography was impressive, as were the costumes and sets.  I particularly liked how Holmes wasn't presented as the perfect Victorian man or genius scholar; rather, he presented lots of personality flaws and goofy moments.

2046770,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Guy Ritchie manages to stay true to Doyle's characterization of Sherlock Holmes, but more so than past films, this action packed movie highlights the martial arts skill in 'baritsu' that Doyle mentioned. When I saw this for the first time, my immediate impression was that there was much more overt violence here than in any other Holmes film I can recall, but the scenes are extremely well done and the actors are superb. Also, the cinematography was impressive, as were the costumes and sets.

The chenistry between Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) is perfect, and it is fun to watch them play off each other with their intelligence, skill and humor. I'm grateful that Watson was accurately portrayed as an intelligent friend and partner to Holmes, true to Doyle's description of his character. I think that Conan Doyle would have been quite pleased with this film in all respects, including his love of the occult and supernatural.

I also note that there is a deeper, more purposeful aspect to this story referring to religion and politics and showing how those in power or aspiring to power often attempt to control the population through fear and terror. This happened in ancient times because people could not understand or control the forces of nature, and alas, it is happening now in many parts of the world.

Web news services recently announced that Guy Ritchie is doing a second Sherlock Holmes film, due December, 2011. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law will again play Holmes and Watson, and Stephen Fry will play Mycroft Holmes. It would be great to see the major players reunited for more superb films, and hopefully this will be the first in a series with many more Sherlock Holmes movies to follow!

The mystery is creative and nicely twisted. Sarcastic modernesque dialog and character interaction that ebbs and flows from love, hate, bitterness, wistfulness and true friendship and back makes this film a rich character piece as well as entertaining fun.

The action sequences are stunning, too, employing fast forward and slow motion segments that keep the viewer's mind hopping. Though this style is used in more and more films, Ritchie makes this quirky, choppy style work exceptionally well in Holmes.

Overall this is a family friendly movie. However, sensitive kids would likely have some trouble with some truly creepy scenes. There are elements of the occult and easily frightened kids will probably be spooked by several scenes.",1284681600,3,989,5.092592592592593

To start with the positives, (a) I always enjoy historical British settings and (b) Holmes' powers of hyperperception and hyperinference (as much inductive as deductive) made me wonder if I couldn't do better myself if I tried harder.

But on the negative side, (a) I found the portrayal of Holmes as slovenly and borderline disfunctional to be hard to swallow, (b) I literally found it difficult to understand what Holme's was saying much of the time, due to his rapid yet quiet mumbling, (c) the plot is fairly childish and somewhat disjointed, and (d) the pace is slow, to the extent that it felt like it took foreover to finish the movie.

2046814,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Maybe I cheated by watching the special feature about the making of the movie before watching the movie, but it helped to reinforce that I shouldn't expect the old Sherlock Holmes, and maybe that helped me to relax and enjoy the movie for the delight that it was.  My following comments might seem rather critical, but keep in mind that I still gave it four (4) stars, and I'm trying to not spoil the climax for any of you who still plan to see it.

Two scenes in particular seemed particularly disjointed, as the action took place and then Holmes recounted in slower motion and more detail what actually happened.  One near the beginning of the movie was when he quickly donned a disquise to follow the lady, and the other was in the denumont as he explained how he was duped, allowing a villian to get away with a key item which might lead to the sequel.  (One can hope that it does.)

In another, boxing fight scene, Holmes previews what he is going to do in slow motion with explanation, and then returns to real time and does it.  Although the scene is referenced again in a later scene, I'm still wondering what the actual sequence added to the movie, other than showing two men fighting with their shirts off, and reinforcing the cold, calculating, practical, logic of Holmes.

The explosion scene outside the factory seemed about two steps over the top, as the secondary and tertiary explosions seemed to go on forever, followed with the shock that Watson survived at all, (though you know in the back of your mind that they can't kill off the lead's main supporting character,) and Holmes was able to walk away.  I did think it good, though, that they at least portrayed the ""shell shock"" that he was under for a few seconds, even though it was terribly unrealistically compressed.  Ah-h, the magic of movies.

Speaking of which, I did enjoy the way Holmes interspersed some of his explanations of the ""elementary"" tricks, and the grand explanation at the end.  Throughout the movie, I was hoping that the secret of the villian surviving the hanging would be different than I expected, but alas, it is exactly what any fan of the genre knows it to be the moment that they see that the hung man appears to have returned from the dead.

Nevertheless, I thought that the entire story was very true to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle style, and the story line engaging -- although the ending was almost obviously inevitable from the beginning, there were some surprises in how they got from one act to the next.  It was obvious and appreciable that they went to great efforts to stay true to the period with the story, sets, costumes, and special effects.  If you watch it from a critical perspective, there are lots of little things to question and challenge.  Keeping in mind that it's just a story, it's well depicted, and very enjoyable viewing.

This movie is young and fresh and very exciting but does ripple with inventive twists to tickle the intellect. I was especially impressed by the fight scenes with their pre-action commentary explaining every move.

2046845,5,B0001Z3TS4,"""Sherlock Holmes"" directed by Guy Ritchie is set in the 1890s in England starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role. The detective crime action thriller has Holmes and Watson, portrayed by Jude Law, doing what they do best, solving mysteries and crime.

Guy Ritchie's vision for this film is beyond brilliant. The feeling and tone he set for this film is flawless. He created this almost grungy look to the screen which encapsulates what the time period and lifestyle for Holmes and Watson would have looked and felt like.

Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Holmes is witty, comical and in some scenes quite heroic. His performance was remarkable but the only thing that bothered me about it was the fact that at some points throughout the film it was difficult to understand exactly what he is saying because he speaks very fast and very low. It's a nice character choice but I would've liked to have been able to hear it the first time and not have to rewind it back a couple of times to hear it and understand it. Other than that minor detail he was great and made Sherlock Holmes extremely admirable.

Jude Law's portrayal of Dr. Watson was impressive as well. He was of course brilliant, and comical but obviously not as fascinating as Holmes but that's the character's fault not Law's fault. He is very likable on screen and he too admirable for his wits and fighting skills. I think the friendship between Holmes and Watson is very unique. They play off each other very well and it's a lot of fun to watch. In today's day and age they would be considered major nerds, just sitting around thinking about solving crime and murders from being brainiacs. But in this film it's very inspiring and definitely mind blowing with the way they uncover how certain events and actions occurred.

There is also a love interest throughout the film, Irene Adler, who is portrayed by the gorgeous Rachel McAdams. Irene Adler is a thief who apparently outsmarted Holmes twice in the past, and who he is also in love with. McAdams gives a fine performance as well. She too is witty and pretty feisty for a woman portrayed in that time period. Her chemistry with Holmes is truly fun to watch because they are obviously great together.

All in all I think this movie is entertainment for just about any audience member. It's not only shot beautifully, but it also has comedy, action and even love throughout the film. A movie everyone can watch and love!

2046846,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Guy Richie wanted to change Sherlock Holmes character and thats fine. A stuffy Holmes isn't as entertaining. The movie itself was entertaining, but was lacking in several areas. The villain Blackwood seemed out of place to me and more fitting for a Raiders of the Lost Ark movie. Rachel McAdams should stay with the dark hair, thats her best look and she's gorgeous in this movie.
I don't think the movie conveyed the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes very well. It did show some of his masterful observation skills at times, but for people not familiar with Sherlock Holmes, this movie doesn't really portray him well. Even though I liked Downey Jr in the part. The movie tried to show his brilliance in some scenes, like getting the flies to fly in the jar counter-clockwise - but that was a pretty lame attempt, more like something a school kid might come up with. So the reason I give it 3 stars is because of that. Holmes was the master of observation and deduction. His favorite saying was ""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"".",1279497600,2,1091,4.747368421052632

2046851,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Guy Ritchie wanted to create a different, more action-oriented version of Sherlock Holmes and he succeeded. Having seen and enjoyed Ritchie's film ""Snatch"", I had an inkling of what to expect - an action movie with plenty of wit. Still, this movie has enough mystery and intelligence to be recognizable as Sherlock Holmes.

Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Holmes - charming, witty, and introspective in turns. Jude Law does well as Watson, who is trying to leave Holmes behind in favor of marriage and a more stable life, but seems unable to. He continues to help Holmes pursue Lord Blackwood, a cult member who dabbled in the dark arts, was caught by Holmes, and then executed only to apparently rise from the dead. Blackwood has been killing those around him in his quest to seize power. Complicating matters for Holmes is Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Holmes's love interest and the one person who bested Holmes in the past.

The defining ""Sherlock Holmes"" moment comes when he is able to explain everything logically, including some events that appeared supernatural. At the same time, Holmes is also shown as a fighter, both in the ring and battling the villains. Personally, I like the portrayal of Holmes as an intelligent action hero of sorts. It might not be traditional, but it seems to work. The main characters were all nicely fleshed out so one cares about them.

The setting and visuals were great and consistent with traditional Sherlock Holmes. The dialogue was witty and well-written in general. Action sequences were used throughout the movie, but there was an equal share of drama as well. I think Guy Ritchie has done a great job of developing a more modern Sherlock Holmes without compromising the essence of Holmes.",1279152000,4,1739,4.908163265306122

I think Downey does for Sherlock Holmes what Johnny Depp did for Pirates of the Caribbean...just not as well. You tend to notice his little mannerisms and quirks in this movie so he resembles Depp. Interestingly enough though, Jude Law's Watson keeps him in check when he goes too far. There's a bit of whimsical idiocy here, which keeps you laughing just when you think there's a dull moment to be had. The plot is pretty simple and I won't give anything away, but I feel that this is one of those movies that you either watch in the theater once, or you buy the dvd and watch it on occasion.

Action - maybe there were some (supposedly) wow special effects, but the movie just DRAGGED. Production - Superficially, it would seem that at least the movie had richly detailed scenery and backgrounds going for it; but, even that, after about 20 minutes lost its allure, just like HDR photography, after the first couple dozen times you see it, begins to look like just one more digital affectation. Audio - These actors don't speak their lines; they mumble them, especially Downey, Jr. It might be easier to follow a silent version; at least, you wouldn't waste your time rewinding a half dozen times to figure out what was said (only to find that it just can't be done). Acting - Just not believable characters the way they were played. OK. This is Sherlock Holmes, after all. We don't really think that he is that smart, do we?

2046884,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Like Leonardo Dicaprio, Robert Downey, Jr. can pretty much do anything onscreen.  He's funny and he's fun to watch.  The rest of the cast of Sherlock Holmes is good as well.  The costumes and sets look great.  Ostensibly, there's no glaring flaw in the movie unless, like me, you don't believe Sherlock Holmes is a Hollywood action hero.

I already knew Holmes is a drug addict, a boozer, a smoker, and somehow he has amazing mental faculties, but he is also brilliant in hand-to-hand combat?  I can't stretch my suspension of disbelief that far, even if it is in keeping with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories and novels.  There's just no way a man that age who never works out, and who sits for weeks on end in a drunken stupor, could look and move that way without throwing up or having a heart attack.  You can only get away with so much lack of logic.

I might have been okay with Holmes being a druggie genius martial artist.  But then I remembered how goofy I always thought Holmes' ""logic"" was.  The movie does a good job of relaying, in flashback sequences, the scenes in the stories and novels when Holmes voices the steps that lead to his solution to the case in question.  Often, what is elementary to Sherlock is a bit of a stretch to the reader, but his leaps of logic in this movie border on the absurd.  It's possible that director Guy Ritchie also felt this way, so he took a jab at Doyle's over-the-top characterization of Holmes by making Holmes' associative thinking appear at least a little ridiculous.

This is definitely a theater movie.  It is a loud, shaky-camera contraption that doesn't seem as fun at home.  It also has a one-way buddy-movie quality that didn't appeal to me: Since Holmes is so messed up and childish, the only way Watson can communicate with him is to stoop to his level of juvenile pranks.  A druggie genius martial artist is also as mature as a frat boy?  C'mon.  Give me some character trait I can believe and care about.

I can't really tell the difference between Downey, Jr.'s Tony Stark (Iron Man, which I liked a lot) and his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.  They both seem to be a mixture of Gregory House (House, M.D.) and Captain Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean).  It's a Hollywood action mix of personas that Downey, Jr. is quite comfortable with.  Most people will have a good time watching this movie, but after seeing a similar performance in Iron Man, and similar directing in Snatch, I didn't find the movie very engaging.",1278460800,14,2489,4.568848758465012
2046885,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I love Sherlock Holmes in its many interpretations and while Jeremy Brett will always BE Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr. makes an excellent 20th Century version of this character. Would recommend in a heart beat! Can't wait for the sequel.",1278374400,,242,5.075

2046887,4,B0001Z3TS4,"So here's the thing:
I grew up on Sherlock Holmes. It started with the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce films when I was a kid. Hound of the baskervilles was my favorite of them. I read every Holmes story from the time I was 12 and I've re-read them several times. My wife is the same way, and we own every Jeremy Brett version. Every Christmas we watch The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. So when we saw the previews for this movie we avoided it like plague.
I finally rented it and we watched it this past week. We were both ready to hate it with our Holmesian nerd rage but...
It turned out that we really liked it. Is it the Holmes we've come to know through Jeremy Brett? No, but it has a good story, a good dynamic with Watson, and really great action scenes.

As usual they play up the Irene Adler stuff into some type of love story. The film also errs by having Holmes being introduced to Mary Morstan when he really met her in Sign of Four before Watson married her. All in all though, I really liked it and the opening scene of Baker Street looked like a homage to the Granada series.

I'm not going to do a synopsis, I'm sure thats been done. Basically if you like Holmes you *might* like this. Robert Downey is really good (a bit dirtier than I expect Holmes to be and with more disheveled hair). Jude Law is good as Watson, although in their rooms he tends to look more working class than I'd expect Watson to look. Fight scenes and explosions are over the top but good. All in all the two Holmes nerds in this house enjoyed it.",1278201600,3,1540,4.199324324324325
2046888,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Whoever directed this should be shown the Cask of Amontillado. Oh wait! That's another story and another author. (Show it to him anyway, and use lots of cement). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be rolling over in his grave if he knew what happened to his famous consulting detective.

Robert Downey Jr. plays a slovenly, socially indiscreet, lazy, unkempt gentleman who seems to have demons that diminish his professional and social skills. When Doctor Watson isn't prodding him into stirring himself out of a lethargic rut, he finds it on his own in nocturnal impulses of East end bare-knuckled jousts with other Victorian low-lifes. He dresses like a slob, and wears a hat that is more befitting of the character, Slip Mahoney in ""The Bowery Boys.""

I could tell you about the plot, but I found myself forgetting it less than two days after viewing it. My mind was even wandering while I was watching it. The plot also moves very fast, which is difficult to follow especially if you are losing interest. I regret having paid for watching it through Netflix but that is offset by my gratitude that I didn't plunk down any Pound Sterling at the box office to see it there. Nevertheless, I still gave this movie the best two hours of my life!

Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is admirable considering bad script and direction. Jude Law, the real Englishman, also plays a fair Dr. Watson. Neither actor seemed that capable of carrying a ridiculous plot, direction, or the remaking of Holmes into a 21st Century action hero. These two seem to have a less than amiable friendship judging by their interaction. By the end, I could care less about either one of them.

The director, what's his name, or Who-the-hell cares, uses the ever popular video flashbacks to show the viewer how Mr. Holmes came to his famous deductive conclusions. The viewer should restrain from blinking during these snippets. I gave this two stars because I still feel that ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucker,"" ""Gigli,"" ""Ishtar"" and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" are worse.

It's elementary dear reader. Stick with ""The Bowery Boys"" and Routine 11.

2046903,1,B0001Z3TS4,"Perhaps in a world containing millions of dedicated fans, true aficionado's of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous literary character (Sherlock Holmes), it would be possible to find ONE individual who believes this motion picture adaptation worthy of purchasing. Likely, this ONE person is the same individual who purchases EVERYTHING with the same ""Sherlock Holmes"" attached to it. However, I am convinced, that no loyal Sherlockian could EVER consider this adaptation faithful to the literary intent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Certainly, the portrayal of Holmes far closer to a Harrison Ford-like production of Indiana Jones (or perhaps a very poorly made James Bond film) from a previous period of history. [I was also slightly reminded of Dr. House in terms of Holmes' arrogance and poor treatment of other people.]

Almost nothing in this film reminds anyone of ANY previous Holmes portrayal: Rathbone, Howard, Cushing, Brett, Fewer, etc. Holmes becomes merely a pathetic action figure.

There is no evidence of the DEEP EMOTIONAL bonding that occurs between Holmes and Watson. Rather Holmes and Watson both treat one another rudely. While one cannot deny that this does occasionally occur in Doyle's stories, it is not the norm of their relationship.

Using my own DEDUCTIVE reasoning, I conclude that this film:

Was written for a 21st century audience who:
  -- cares little about preserving the intent of writers
  -- has to see sex in every movie (even though there is NO evidence that Holmes would EVER engage sexually -
  and much evidence to suggest that Holmes would not, especially with a woman)
  -- adores Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law (even though their acting was nothing spectacular)
  -- write reviews praising the film that say 'this film was so good' without explaining what made it 'so good' [Of course, there are some exceptions.]

  -- who will rate a review negatively (often without reading it) simply because they disagree with the reasonable conclusions of the writer

Lastly:

If you just want to purchase another typical motion picture production that is poor edited, full of contradictions, similar to the previous 100 action films, than this is the film for you.

If you wish to purchase an intelligent series of Sherlock Holmes films (that show the multi-dimensional nature of Holmes and Watson), I recommend the series starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and David Burke/Edward Hardwicke as Dr. John Watson. The Brett series is FAR more mentally stimulating for individuals who desire to preserve the legacy of Doyle's famous consulting detective.",1277164800,12,2590,5.180288461538462
2046904,1,B0001Z3TS4,"If you have actually read and love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal characters, then I can sum up this review by saying: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! You may run the risk of an apoplectic fit.

Apparently, Holmes is a short, filthy, scruffy, drunken twit who rummages through Watson's medical bag to drink his anesthetic for cataract surgery (which would have been cocaine, in the Victorian era). Yes, SH did use injectable cocaine, however I found this insinuation he was a desperate addict rather unsettling. It is also implied Holmes has had an illicit affair with Irene Adler -- whose character is moderately chafing in this movie. Best of all, the Doctor, instead of being awed by Holmes, despises him. Oh, and Baker Street was a filthy cesspool, Holmes and Mrs. Hudson appear to be mortal enemies, etc. It was nothing more than a parody of Conan Doyle's characters, using name recognition and the older than dirt Sherlock Holmes fandom to make a buck.

For everyone else...

My main qualm with the movie was how disjointed it appeared from beginning to end. One has only to watch the nigh on a dozen trailers to realize how many scenes did not make the final cut. Unfortunately, someone down at editing did a botched job of seaming these holes, and it showed, painfully. Especially in regards to that entire Holmes/Adler side plot. It was confusing at best, but mostly just annoying. The plot was thin, outdated, and ridiculous. I enjoy a good occult-ish themed flick as much as anyone else, but the operative word here is GOOD. This reeked. Again, I had the feeling the flow was disjointed, that scenes were added or omitted without enough forethought to continuity. This only detracted from an already lame plot.

I could go on about the dumbed down dialogue which borrowed heavily from quotes out of the original stories to spice up bad writing. Or the entirely overdone action sequences that were sorely out of place and had me bored to tears. Or how Hollywood bastardized two of the most beloved literary characters to modernize and re-invent them for greed & 21st century audiences.

In the end, it was a mildly entertaining steam-punk movie, but not one that was able to hold my attention for very long. After a while it became grating on the nerves to sit through, due to the combination of terrible writing, plotting, drawn out slow-mo 'action' scenes, mediocre acting, and the disgrace this was to Holmes & Watson.",1276905600,12,2426,4.808153477218226
2046905,4,B0001Z3TS4,"When my mother saw the first trailer for Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, she scoffed and waved her hand at the screen in a gesture of pure aversion. I imagine many readers of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories had this same reaction, and I realize why. The trailers for the film actually do it a disservice by showing all the action and special effects and none of the intellectualism that the writers actually keep somewhat sacred from the source material. Its true that these loyalties are somewhat hidden beneath effects, but nevertheless, I not only liked Ritchie's reimagining of the sly sleuth, but I applauded several times throughout the film.

Like all of Ritchie's films, the plot is somewhat convoluted. Three people are credited under screenplay, which may be an indicator that this was a complex screen story to begin with. True enough, the small details of the film are vital, and the manic way that Ritchie directs serves this purpose strangely well, stripping away many pacing issues and much of the banality that could have come attached to this sort of project. As the movie begins, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) manage to bring to justice some kind of black magic-cult leader named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for several mysterious murders around London. He then rises from the grave, and must be stopped before he fulfills his threatening plot against all of England. Meanwhile, Watson is in the process of retiring from his partnership with Holmes due to his erratic behavior and repellent lifestyle.

Of course, they must join together one last time to take down the nemesis Blackwood. In the process of doing so, they encounter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), a criminal and former lover of Holmes' who ran off leaving him heartbroken. Robert Downey Jr. has excellent chemistry with both McAdams and Law, which is crucial in a film with such a confusing plot as this. The characters are very fun to listen to, particularly the bickering between Holmes and Watson, driven by brilliant actors. Downey Jr. is superb as usual here, bringing charm and whimsy while also maintaining Holmes' boozy, fist aiming, somewhat depressed nature.

The production design is excellent here, particularly in the final showdown atop an unfinished tower bridge. To see the period placed in this context is truly fascinating. There are some wonderful Ritchie trademarks as well, and he uses all of his best hallmark shots, such as a slow-motion sequence involving a vast amount of explosives. All of these special effects, rather than burying the film's more grounded aspects, simply compliment the subtle and terrific performances, and the complicated but enduring story.

Hans Zimmer's excellent score is also noteworthy, as its banjos, accordions, harpsichords, tack pianos, drums and string sections stomp forth and chug along forcefully and confidently, denoting Holmes' certainly that this is just another case that is, as Basil Rathbone's portrayal once said, ""Elementary, my dear Watson.""

There is so much going on, that although some things are predictable it is still delivered to you in fine fashion.

2046908,2,B0001Z3TS4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Here is the newfangled Sherlock Holmes, courtesy action director Guy Ritchie. Ritchie initially wanted to cast a younger actor for the part of Sherlock Holmes but settled on Robert Downey Jr., after envisioning the new Holmes as a Bohemian artist type. This fit right in with Downey's belief that Holmes is supposed to be ""quirky and kind of nuts"", an interpretation which was suggested to him by his real life wife, Susan Downey. What appealed to Downey about this interpretation of Holmes is ""quirky and kind of nuts"" is the way he views himself!

  Now I have no problem with Holmes being depicted as eccentric (which is precisely the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle conceived him) but there was also a certain meticulousness and dignity which Downey runs away from in his interpretation. Start with Downey's unshaved look throughout the picture--would the meticulous Holmes allow himself to look so scruffy while everyone else in proper Victorian society is so well manicured? Despite his amazing powers of deductive reasoning and ability to solve cases, Victorian society would never accept a Holmes that refuses to conform to its basic norms. I'm also thinking of the ludicrous opening scene at the Baker Street apartment where Holmes is shooting bullets into the wall in an attempt to develop some kind of early 'silencer'. Can you imagine Basil Rathbone, from the original Sherlock Holmes movies, shooting at the walls and terrorizing his landlady and the other lodgers in the building?

  And isn't it beneath Holmes to be so petty in his relationship to his perennial sidekick, Watson? The scene at the restaurant where he brings Watson's fianc to tears and causes her to walk out, just seems so out of character for Holmes. Yes, he's supposed to be cold and insensitive at times, but that happens when he becomes absorbed in attempting to solve his cases. It should not apply to a social gathering where he boorishly undermines the relationship between a close colleague and his fianc.

  The childish interplay between Holmes and Watson goes on for a good two thirds of the movie. I fail to see the humor in such scenes as inside the carriage when Holmes teases Watson by keeping the money he won gambling the night before (Watson of course is an inveterate gambler) and Watson then (tit for tat) throws Holmes' vest outside the carriage window. Both Robert Downey and Jude Law both seem to offer up the same over the top interpretations for Holmes and Watson and I found I couldn't distinguish very well between the two characters. I much prefer the buffoonish Nigel Bruce as Watson opposite Basil Rathbone in those old movies since at least the contrast between the two was evident.

  Ritchie's plot runs into a great deal of trouble for the first two thirds of the movie due to slow pacing. There's an attempt to pick things up with a couple of action scenes which grow tiresome. I had no trouble with the early scene of Downey as action hero in the boxing ring which Ritchie claims is derived from the original Sherlock Holmes stories; but then there's a long drawn out sequence where Holmes and Watson battle an evil giant and then end up destroying a ship while in dry dock. Then there's the scene with Irene Adler interacting with a hidden Professor Moriarty; we end up seeing the scene twice since Holmes ends up explaining what he deduces from his confrontation with the evil Professor to Watson.

  Nor is the rest of the story very exciting leading to the climax. Reordan, the man Adler has been looking for, turns up dead in Lord Blackwell's coffin, despite Blackwell being hanged earlier for the murder of five women. Then Blackwell murders his father who heads the Temple of the Four Orders.

  Finally things begin to pick up when Holmes confronts Home Secretary Lord Coward. In one of the best scenes in the movie, Holmes tricks Coward into revealing that Blackwood and company intend to wipe out all members of the House of Lords. Holmes is initially brought to Coward in handcuffs but it's later revealed that Inspector Lestrade has given Holmes the keys to escape. Lestrade, by the way, reminds me of the excellent late actor, Donald Pleasance, and ably acquits himself in the thankless role of second fiddle to Sherlock Holmes.

  For those sticklers who find all of the evil Blackwell's machinations to be completely implausible (such as how he manages evade detection in staging his own death by hanging), I cannot disagree; however, the film is not supposed to be taken too literally or seriously. Ritchie finally gets things moving at the climax and I liked how Holmes dispatches Blackwell on the under construction Tower Bridge. I'm not so sure however, how Irene Adler survives that fall after Blackwell pushes her off the bridge.

  For purists such as myself, the scenes where Holmes uses his deductive reasoning (such as his ability to follow a carriage's path while blindfolded) are quite welcome. Nonetheless, with Robert Downey choosing to play Holmes for a good part of the time as a lout who resembles a drunkard and a completely nondescript Watson who serves up no significant contrasts to his wily colleague, the new Sherlock Holmes lacks the main ingredient that has been found to be offered up by some of its predecessors: charm!",1276300800,5,5319,4.855088495575221

2046938,4,B0001Z3TS4,"First of all, SHERLOCK HOLMES is truly a 4 star movie, but there are a lot of things that go into the movie. There's the director, the actors, the history of Sherlock & the story itself. Personally, not being a big fan of Guy Ritchie, I thought the movie was well done and surprisingly intelligent.

SHERLOCK HOLMES was certainly overblown at times, but Ritchie kept that at a minimal. For a movie that at times got a little talky and slow, he picked just the right time to throw a giant boat anchor at the screen to wake you up. Ultimately though, I thought the movie was exceedingly great at doing quick flash backs at all the things that the ultra-aware-notice everything Sherlock Holmes caught... and you did not. That, to me, was great fun and the highlight of the film that had a great story throughout.

Truly, my only real criticism is that Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) was wasted and not given justice in this story. Rachel McAdams is one of those actresses that has been designated the 3rd wheel in so many films and I can't wait for somebody to finally give her more of a role to play. She really does nothing in this film except get kidnapped and have to be saved and then has an emotional scene at the end because she got herself tangled up with some unsavory characters.

Otherwise, SHERLOCK HOLMES was well done and I can't wait for the sequel. I hope Rachel McAdams is in it, but I wouldn't blame her for not, if her role is similar to this one.",1276128000,3,1461,4.4037037037037035

I love the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the most famous movie adaptations featuring Basil Rathbone and, more recently, Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes.  I was skeptical that this movie would be in the same league as those portrayals of Holmes.  My concerns were well founded.  The writers decided to give Holmes an edgier persona, probably to appeal to a younger viewing audience.  Sherlock Holmes is portrayed as sloppy looking, cocky, and rude.  At times he actually comes across as an idiot.  Sherlock Holmes did not possess these qualities.  He was meticulous, confident (yes), but dignified and always a gentleman.  And he never came across as an idiot.  In addition the film is excessively packed with over the top action scenes and hand to hand combat (they even have Holmes compete in an ultimate fighting style cage match).  I realize that this stuff is popular today, but I was hoping for just a good suspenseful mystery.  That's what Sherlock Holmes was all about.  The story line itself is really weak and filled with supernatural elements.  The actor portraying Dr. Watson didn't do a bad job, and Rachel McAdams was decent as Irene Adler.  But this was hardly enough to offset the weak story and, more importantly, the horrible portrayal of Sherlock
Holmes.  If you're a fan of the ""traditional"" Sherlock Holmes, I think you will be very disappointed with this film.",1274659200,4,1476,4.844

Otherwise, it exceeded my expectations! The chemistry between Downey and Law is full of charm and charisma and they click in their versions of Holmes and Watson. They draw you in quickly! Downey steals the show with his hip, swagger, brilliant, funny portrayal of Holmes. I never read any of the novels or have been an uber-fan of anything involving Sherlock Holmes, but it is not really necessary in order to enjoy this movie. There is a fine blend of action, suspense, and intrigue. Not to mention some very funny stuff too! The costumes and the overall atmosphere takes you back to a more primitive time in our existence. Purist fans who have read the novels will find flaws, but they always do.

I am also a sceptic who believes everything can be explained through science. Anyone who believes David Blaine can really levitate is a stupid moronic idiot! No one can REALLY do magic! Holmes uses the science of that time, maybe exadurated a bit in the movie, to prove fact from fiction.

Even if you are not a fan of Holmes and Watson, I highly recommend this fine film! I may be right or I may be wrong. Take care all! Carpe diem'!

You met your wife online, but made up a story about ""love at first sight while in college"" to tell others because you're a little embarrassed.  And your favorite number is your birth date.  In summary, you have too much discretionary income and not enough discretion in your viewing habits.

The largest problem this movie offers is probably my own.  My expectation.

I expected a movie about the worlds greatest detective would let me play along, and in the end, when he points out all that I missed, I would agree that he is brilliant.  However, there is no game to play here.  1. Because you're not included and 2. it's spelled out (outside of Moriarity's interests).

In the end, Holmes lists all the things he saw that you didn't, but not because you're quiz shows aren't in fact helping you think, but because you're never really shown anything.  I tasted this; I smelled that; I noticed this.  All of this happens behind the scenes, or behind the mind of Holmes, and there's no way for us to peer inside and smell, etc for ourselves.

Sherlock Holmes stays on the surface - a bloody, snarky skin - and only hints at something more toward the end.  Really, the end is the only moderately decent portion, but only because you hear of the ""Moriarty"" character, whose just as brilliant as Holmes is.  The problem in mentioning this is, of course, the thought that it leads to: ""If he's so fantastic, why isn't he the main antagonist here?""

2047052,5,B0001Z3TS4,"There aren't many movies around that dare to reinvent something both literary and cinematic that is beloved by readers and movie-goers alike, but action director Guy Ritchie has dared in a big way ...and succeeded beyond my expectations.

When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Study-in-Scarlet/dp/1450596185/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Study in Scarlet</a>, 1887), he made Holmes a roughshod, drug-addled genius with keen deductive powers. This made him a person that lay-readers could identify with. A man with problems, but with unique abilities that were much in demand. Coming off the heels of the Victorian era, too, Holmes was - in a very real way - a person coming out of that stuffy time period and into the more loose and modern one. Again, something readers of the time could identify with.

Although the books live on in perpetuity, most of the population over the age of 40 are probably more familiar with director Roy Neill's television series starring the estimable Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson (if you're under 40 you're probably hooked on the hit TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B001QE99AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House M.D.</a>&nbsp;which has more than just a passing familiarity with Doyle's character). Basil recreated the character of Holmes and also cleaned him up quite a bit. No drugs. Clean shaven. A real gentleman. In Doyle's literary works, however, this is far from the case ... which brings us to this new manifestation: the 2009 cinematic work starring Robert Downey Jr. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) as Holmes and Jude Law (REPO MEN) as Watson.

Downey Jr. is one of our great new actors. He is a chameleon in every sense of the word. Which is why I found his Holmes to be extremely well played. From his migraines to drugging Watson's beloved dog, Downey Jr. truly encompassed everything that Doyle wrote about. He's both brilliant and prone to folly; seeks a new case that's semi-interesting but is just as likely to seek out a new drug to make him feel more interested; and only has eyes for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Stone/dp/B000EMGJ72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Stone</a>) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.

This film is, hopefully, a reawakening of the Sherlock Holmes mystique; but a reawakening with Doyle's truly flawed character and not some scrubbed clean version. The ending of this movie certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Let's hope that happens.

One final word of warning in case you didn't get what I was saying: this isn't your grandmas Sherlock Holmes. If you want Rathbone, go watch him. If you want Doyle's Holmes, check out Guy Ritchie's newest (and more accurate) interpretation.",1273968000,10,3100,5.88
2047063,1,B0001Z3TS4,"I'm sixteen year old great fan of the Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made in the late thirties and mid-forties. I cannot begin to relate to you how HORRIBLE this movie was! As mentioned by a previous reviewer, all of a sudden, Holmes and Dr. Watson have been transformed into two gorgeous, younger guys who know how to kick butt. I also must say that this is an exceptionally dumbed-down portrayal of the classic stories of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle, so that even the most pinheadded people could understand the plot. The classic characters created by Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle have been turned into twenty-first century smart alec twits. In the beginning of the movie, I felt it was very intellectually stimulating, then it just got dumber and dumber... This movie was definitely aimed toward the younger generation. This movie also utterly lacks subtlety and suspense that the older movies had. And don't even get me started on the quality of acting! I COULDN'T EVEN WATCH THIS MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE HOW SUB-PAR IT WAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was certainly not cracked up as it was supposed to be. I have read all of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes. And then my love of classic movies brought me to find the old film series with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. This new movie can't hold a candle to the brilliant acting of the classic pair, the complex plots, the intellectually stimulating and suspenseful atmosphere, the exquisite camerawork and the overall excellence of the classic Rathbone and Bruce film series.

2047065,4,B0001Z3TS4,"""Sherlock Holmes"" portrays the downside of the ""Renaissance Man."" Imagine being able to outthink, outwit and outfight most people and then become trapped in a cocoon of self-misery based on these facts alone. The genius and lamentations of Sherlock Holmes is excellently played by Robert Downey, Jr. While one usually would need to be an anglophile or at least appreciate the backdrop of England (circa) 1880's--1900's, Downey and Jude Law make it fun.  The intellectualism of the characters is a breath of fresh air from the mindless, hackneyed movies normally on the modern day roster.

""Sherlock Holmes"" is an odyssey through human nature and the need for illusions, whether it is the need to believe in the dead or delusions of grandeur based on self importance.  ""Sherlock Holmes"" shows the upside and downside of human nature and the vagaries in between.

I highly recommend this movie for the comedic erudite.

Unfortunately, all these assumptions of Holmes are incorrect, and this movie is the first ever to portray Sherlock Holmes correctly according to Sir Author Conan Doyle's character.

What I love about this movie is that all the characters that are in it (aside from the main antagonist) are actual characters in Doyle's stories and are all portrayed correctly.  The movie itself- though slightly hard to follow the first time around, plays just like any Sherlock Holmes story reads, leading the viewer on the case, but the viewer never see Holmes' thought process of the case revealed until the very end.

I saw the movie before I read any of the books or stories of Sherlock Holmes.  After the movie, I was curious to see how much they stretched the characters and story and how much they distorted it.

It features a cast full of stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Rachel McAdams, and Jude Law.  There are great special effects, an original soundtrack, solid costume and set design, and very believable action scenes.

I won't listen to critics any longer after this.
I rented it out of curiosity because I like Sherlock Holmes films. In fact, I have the entire Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes films as well as several others like Murder be Decree and the 7 Per Cent Solution. So I decided to give this movie a chance despite what others had said..and I thoroughly enjoyed it..much to my surprise..
I thought this was a really fantastic film, far surpassing my expectations.
This is not the best Sherlock Holmes film ever made, but this film has a great deal of action all the way through, a very thought out story where you need to pay attention so you can find clues to the mystery. The cinematography was fantastic. This to me captured the turn of the century feel as well as a 1970's Sherlock Holmes film. Robert Downey Jr might not be the best ever Holmes, but he was certainly credible in his role. He is a fantastic actor. Watch for the scene with the flies , this I believe came from a Basil Rathbone Holmes movie. And the climax atop an unfinished bridge is breathtaking, not just for the action but the scenery as well.
To those like me who prefer Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes , Robert Downey Jr. did a tremendous job with the character. He had quite the shoes to fill not just the shoes of Rathbone and Brett but Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee & Christopher Plummer who also played Sherlock Holmes at one point or another.
The interaction between Holmes and Watson was phenomenal. Jude Law as Watson was also well done, my only gripe was he was more a 'tough guy' in this picture than how he's been portrayed in previous films.
This was a little bit revisionist but the movie didn't resort to lousy, campy unfunny one liners. The humor came at appropriate times & did not interfere with the pacing of this movie. Holmes doing crazy experiments such as hanging himself on the ceiling might have been a little too far fetched, tongue in cheek but still fit well with this picture.
This was a magical picture to me. I will not give away anything to spoil it, other than I think it will take repeated viewings to absorb it all. Very highly recommended despite what some critics might say & if it isn't true to the books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Whether or not based on the books, as a film in itself I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Even if you prefer other actors' rendition of Sherlock Holmes I would give this a try because you might be pleasantly surprised with how well Robert Downey plays Sherlock Holmes as well as Jude Law playing Doctor Watson who in this film gets a slight origin mentioned as to what makes him more of a 'tough' guy in this picture.
There also was implication that a sequel could be made, and after seeing this 2 times now, I would be all for a sequel to this movie..if they can keep the formula more or less the same.

2047091,2,B0001Z3TS4,"So, why call it Sherlock Holmes?

Just because you put a story in the same location as the original, and use the same names as the original characters does not mean it is the same story. Bearing little resemblance or feel to any type of Holmes story, this film takes on the same path of many comic book action films, where the dastardly villain (in this case,  Lord Blackwood) and our hero ( Sherlock Holmes) battle it out till the very end. The movie, on its own merits, might have passed as just another shallow, stupid, yet entertaining and brainless popcorn action flick with cute, witty lines, and enough over-the-top and predictable action to please and enthrall masses. It is just the flick that screams: ""Sequel."" Being called Sherlock Holmes, it becomes the lowest denominator in a long line of Holmes films, and personifies the lackluster, superficial direction films have taken lately when trying to recreate a story or film.

The ""political license"" taken by the director in characterizing Holmes and Watson is ridiculous. The duo, being billed as almost equals, really kills any credibility from the get-go. For one thing, they are almost the same age and seem act more like college buddies than sleuths. Watson is no longer a wise sidekick of Holmes, but more of the ""cool"" buddy that Holmes can exchange rivalries and squabbles with. Why not just have Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing the roles?  Or how about Mel Gibson and Dannie Glover? The director/producer seemed to miss the point that Holmes deduction was methodical and insightful, not just some psychic prediction used to impress others. Watson, as a trusty veteran to Holmes' deduction, respects the value of Holmes' smarts, and the interest in a case. Here, their camaraderie takes on the role of more of a ""buddy action film"". There are glimpses occasionally of Holmes' insight, but these moments are seldom.

Not only that, but the suspense of a typical Holmes story is stripped away, and inserted with edginess or gimmicks to try to cater to masses. We have the quick moving camera shots a la The Matrix or Fight Club. We have the mandatory romantic interest of Holmes and Irene Adler to give some ""depth"" to the story. We have the usual hero-villain dialogue exchanges, and the battle to the end finish.  Like we didn't see that coming from a mile away.

I guess if there is anything to be positive about, it is the fact that Robert Downey Jr. has proven he can take on many roles, and does have charisma and personality. He does a moderate job as Holmes, and, if given a better script, it might have been a memorable performance. However, there really was not much there, and the plot, other than Holmes trying to stop Blackwood, was an incoherent mess.

Some may say that the directors and producers have some license to ""reinvent"" the story any way they want. Well, yeah, I guess that is so. You could also have a remake of Jaws, and make it about a shark that escapes hunters and needs to reunite with his shark family. That probably wouldn't go so well, would it? The bottom line is that license to reinvent only goes so far.

The characters were definitely not as I had seen them portrayed before, though I was more prepared for the portrayal of Watson, whom I knew to be a former military officer, than that of Holmes.  But I can't say the character portrayals were unfamiliar - watching Holmes and Watson was like watching House and Wilson on an episode of House, MD.",1272672000,2,653,4.371900826446281
2047096,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I just want to throw in my 2 cents with those who thoroughly enjoyed this Holmes outing.  I was not impressed by the trailers, and I didn't think that I would take to the Guy Ritchie style of energizing the iconic character, but sorry you purists, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law won me over and even though Ritchie's typical fast-paced direction, dialogue, and muscular editing, plus the big screen action and CGI took Holmes from the quiet deducting in the drawing room to spectacular fisticuffs and Bondian action, I really didn't care because it was damned entertaining.  I very much liked the voice-over inner workings of Holmes' mind, and I enjoyed the difficulty of Holmes' character that Downey brings out so freshly. And, I am again pleased that Law's Watson has been thoroughly distanced from Nigel Bruce's bumbler.

As many have said, and I have stated in earlier reviews, I am a great fan of Jeremy Brett's Holmes series.  I believe they are truer to the Victorian era and the books, and a definitve portrayal.  However, I was surprised and delighted that the big budget, big effects Ritchie movie, despite its departures from the tone of the texts, still captured the spirit of the duo and especially Holme's elusive, difficult and enigmatic character.  In all cases, he was brilliant and high-strung, and he is here as well.  And in all cases Watson was a veteran of the Afghan wars, and a sturdy and reliable comrade, and the rock of sobriety and steadiness a mercurial figure like Holmes could fasten on.

Anyway, yeah it's Hollywood, and big and noisy and over-the-top.  But it looks great and it does get to an aspect of Holmes, as other reviewers have pointed out, that is often overlooked.  He was courageous, a skilled and adept fighter, with many talents for mayhem.  A good Victorian wouldn't glorify or elevate these traits, but they are definitely alluded to in the stories, and Holmes never shirked or hesitated going after villains who were ruthless, violent, and often better-armed.  So that confidence came from somewhere, from some real experience.  So, non-Victorian, action movie director Ritchie does dramatize and accentuate this aspect perhaps more than some would like.  Yes, the cerebral has been sacrificed to the big action pieces, but it's a movie, and it stands or falls on those elements.  I found it fast and entertaining and fun.

Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Richie team up in this movie to bring us a completely new version of Holmes. He is buff, corky and crude, and his British accent is somewhat questionable. This being said, the film moves along swiftly and keeps the viewers entertained along the way. The central villain of this film is a cartoonish cardboard cutout with delusions of grandeur, but we do see a promising prospect for a much better antagonist for the sequel - professor Moriarty. I could really do without the bro-mance between Holmes and Watson that strives for a cool nonchalance. Jude Law plays it with a straight face despite the rather dubious jealousy of Holmes towards Watson's upcoming engagement. Overall, this film was made miles better than it could have been by the great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and even Rachel McAdams.

2047098,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Explosions, human sacrifice, and violence, oh my! Downey was an interesting Holmes, but ultimately miscast. Law was very strange as Watson. The plot was very silly. The women were completely rewritten characters. Irene Adler was an actress, not a thief. She was of sterling character and brilliant. Both qualities attracted Holmes. To portray Watson as a brawler was a stretch. His shoulder-or-leg war injury (it varied in the stories) made him more of a retiring fellow than Law portrayed him. He was brave, but I don't remember him fighting in any of the stories. He carried a revolver and I think a cane sometimes for protection. Holmes was an expert in boxing, stick fighting, and a martial art. I don't think Holmes would have fought in an illegal bare-knuckle match, he was an amateur boxer.

The CGI was bad in spots. The action was non stop and ultimately mind numbing. The deductions seemed silly at times, others they did steal from the books. The camera angles and movement were interesting sometimes and very distracting other times. The sets and scenery were okay.

In summary, the movie referenced the stories better than I thought they would. Making both Watson and Holmes more active was interesting. I thought Rathbone in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" was spot on. In the other movies, Rathbone's Holmes became cartoonish. Downey did good things with Holmes, but he just didn't work for me. Law as Watson was just plain silly. Both actresses were very good. Lestrade was pretty good. The biggest drawback is that the plot was predictable and silly.",1272499200,,1567,4.931818181818182
2047099,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I thought overall this was a surprisingly decent adaptation of Sherlock Holmes - given that it's a big-budget Hollywood flick. Unfortunately, Sherlock Holmes does inject a lot of fighting scenes and make Holmes a bit of an action hero. In several scenes, he has to fight with his bare fists.

However, I think Sherlock Holmes does preserve the essential attributes of Holmes - the cold demeanor, the keen observer, and the ability to piece together disparate pieces of evidence to come to brilliant conclusions. By the middle of the movie, I could see Robert Downey Jr. as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes. I was as crazy about Jude Law's Dr. Watson - he seemed a bit too normal and drab.

The plot was a bit odd. The world is threatened by a secret cult - a decidedly un-Holmesian case. However, the twists and turns were in keeping with those in the books. There are several mysteries which initially seem supernatural or impossible, but Holmes then unravels them calmly and coolly.

Overall, I wouldn't say this is a great adaptation of Doyle's novels. I'd prefer a movie that had a less action, more cerebral feel to it. Nonetheless, given today's Hollywood, I'm glad somebody did a reasonable attempt to bring Holmes and Dr. Watson to life.",1272499200,,1244,4.776744186046511

2047102,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I notice how may of the reviewers refer to this film as an 'updated' version of Sherlock but if you have read any of Sir Doyle's books you would understand that Mr. Ritchie has, in fact, given us a more original story than any of the previously made 'classic' Holmes films. Mr. Holmes was a boxer and quite the rogue at times in the books. In addition, Mr. Watson was in the service of Her Highness' Royal armed service. If one thinks about it logically, the duo would have to have a bit more than just cunning to be involved with investigating cases that have some of the worst perpetrators in London. Doyle also had a penchant for criticizing the aristocracy on the down-low and placed characters like Lord Blackwood in his stories. I appreciated Ritchie's nod to Freemasonry using some very old imagery and symbols and his acknowledgment of the technological advancement of the late 1800s. Many people think the stuff we have now was developed during the mid-late part of the 20th century but that is not so. Keeley's Resonance Engine was one and that got suppressed by coal interests - over 100 years later, and it's still not on the market. My hat's off to Mr. Ritchie, who has done it again with his eye for action, taste for dark humor and intuitive direction. I suggest folks grab a few of Sir Doyle's books - he was ahead of his time - and I thank the cast and crew of this film for bringing us the true nature of Sherlock Holmes and his boy Dr. Watson.",1272499200,2,1462,4.438661710037175

2047107,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I can't say that I've ever actually read the Sherlock Holmes books. I do remember seeing the old black and white films though. I found them to be somewhat flat and rather Clue-ish... but done in all seriousness, which rather robbed them of impact or suspense. So it's safe to say that my first experience with the Holmes mythos starts with the Guy Ritchie film.

With regards to plot intrigues, this film is rather thin on them. A sharp observer can get the gist of it within the first fifteen minutes or so. In addition, I felt that the whole supernatural aspect of the plot device rather silly and slightly dull.

However, as I continued watching the film, it became more and more clear that the case that Holmes and Watson were attempting to solve was more a side note to the real plot of the movie: Holmes dealing with Watson getting engaged and moving out. Indeed, the character byplay between them made me forget entirely that this movie was ""supposed"" to be about solving a case, it was that much fun. For that matter, the sound editing fully backs it up as a character story. There are points where the sound becomes as one character would hear it, lending an almost first person feel to some of the scenes, even though they were not shot that way.

Anyway, I thought that the acting was excellent and splendidly entertaining. I could not get enough of Watson and Holmes sniping at each other. Fans of the older Holmes movies might disagree with Watson's portrayal, as Jude law is neither short or rotund, but I found that it worked for this movie extremely well and made it more of an equal partnership between the two men. The little hyper-analytical segments before Holmes smacks someone around managed to speak volumes about him in a very small space of time and his pervasive social ineptness made him into a more believable character. The female characters weren't all that bad either, with Mary providing a quiet foil to Irene's outspokenness, but both having a great deal of capability in totally different arenas.

All in all, I found this to be less of a detective mystery type story and much more of an action adventure with awesome characters. Again, I have no idea how close to the books this film is, but rest assured, I will be finding out. In any case, I will probably continue to enjoy the movie regardless.'",1272412800,,2333,4.614457831325301

2047112,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes' legacy got killed by this movie. It could've been much better, but it wasn't. For those old readers who love and know Sherlock Holmes, the movie was terrible. Even though it had Robert Downey Junior as Sherlock Holmes (which was wonderful, he really fits the character), some great scenes and other good deductions that Sherlock Holmes made during the movie, it wasn't good enough to be a Sherlock Holmes film. The soundtrack was horrible (too much country music, which doesn't fit Sherlock Holmes in anyway). If you see the trailer, it may convices you to buy it, but it's foolish.

 It was a nice idea to make a Sherlock Holmes with more action, but it didn't workout. Once the movie starts, you want to keep watching (after all, the beginning was nice), but after an hour, it gets boring and you lose the point of the film. Sherlock Holmes (not only the character, but everything in the movie) was too modern; of course it's during the XIX century, but the music, the fighting scenes, and the characters were too modern. I think that, once again, Hollywood tried to make something good of what already was and screwed up. For those who already read all other Sherlock Holmes' stories, the script was nice because it used old talks, like ""Because I was looking for it"" (""Silver Blaze""); ""You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion"" (""The Man with the Twisted Lip""); ""Crime is common, logic is rare"" (""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches""); ""My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems. Give me work"" (The Sign of the Four); ""It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely"" (""The Boscombe Valley Mystery""); ""Data, data, data--I cannot make bricks without clay"" (""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches""), and ""...one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts"" (""A Scandal in Bohemia"").

 The director wastes time to talk about Watson's marriage. What does that got to do with the story, it's so childish. I hope that in the next movie (which has already been confirmed) the director, Guy Ritchie, changes. Instead of wasting time on action and comedy, the director and his crew should concentrate on more interesting subject to make the spectator interested and mystery.

 I'm sorry to say the truth, but don't except much from the movie because you're going to let yourself down.",1272326400,16,2424,4.814903846153846

2047114,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes has always conjured up Basil Rathborne or some other BBC production type image but this movie blows it away.  Guy Ritchie's version kicks butt and Robert Downey, Jr. has made Sherlock Holmes his own original character.  The acting, storyline and imagery contained in this movie are beautiful to watch.  Mind you, after two hours of viewing it made me wonder how long this movie was going to be but it never dragged.

The bad guy is caught within minutes of opening credits.  It was to be the last job of Holmes & Watson before Watson settled down to a cozy married life.  Of course things do not go as planned and the duo has to step in to stop the forces of evil.  The plot is suitably sinister with a mysterious group (Free Masons anyone?) that becomes corrupted by a power hungry decendant who dabbles with the dark side. Does this sounds too formula?  Fear not, because Ritchie stirs things up with his love of action and off-beat humor.  There's the usual fighting scenes (the boxing match), the behemoth thug and lots of humor all mixed together (having Holmes try out various concoctions on the dog).  The love interest was thankfully light and the movie zipped by in beautifully hued images.  The cinematography is amazing.

Everything about this movie was amazing and I highly recommend it.  Some fans of the old school Sherlock Holmes might not appreciate this updated version.  I would also recommend turning on the subtitles to fully enjoy the dialogue.",1272240000,,1481,4.756862745098039

2047121,4,B0001Z3TS4,"After some commercial flops and disappointments, and a period of personal retrenchment for Canadian screen star Rachel McAdams, she comes back in a big box office smash--but will it help her career?  Does anyone in fact know that she's in it?  Though she's amusing and maybe sexier than she's been in previous parts, McAdams is given short shrift as Irene Adler--for Holmes, she would always be ""The Woman,"" and a lot of painful allusions to her sexual life proved one of the more embarrassing updates to the old Holmes canon.  She seems embarrassed herself at some of the twists her character is doomed to lurch through--though she always looks good in the elaborate period costumes of the late Victorian era.  Or is it the Edwardian Age?  The character Mark Strong is playing, based obviously on Aleister Crowley, is playing him as the ""wickedest man in England,"" a reputation Crowley didn't achieve until 1910 or so, and the establishment of the O.T.O.  You have to give the screenwriters some props for inventing puzzles for Holmes to solve that are actually cleverer than the ones he dealt with in the books, though Guy Ritchie's super sped-up flashbacks and retreads aren't very helpful at underscoring this.  We saw this movie on a Jet Blue flight to NY during which every ounce of free TV had been wiped out due to technical difficulties, so the pilots relented and let us watch all the pay movies for free.

There are too many dark scenes.  Once you figure out where the plot is going (not so easy since it is distracting) you figure out the end and wonder if you want to struggle through.  Downey is a good actor I guess, but he plays a totally unlikeable and not very interesting loser with slapstick thrown in just for good measure.  The movie is nothing like anything Arthur Conan Doyal wrote and he would roll over in his grave to know how much license was taken to destroy his books and especially Holmes character.

He was not as eccentric as I hoped he would be.  I went into this film with overly high expectations and came out feeling extremely disappointed.  I even saw this film twice just to make sure I wasn't having a bad day when I saw it the first time. Maybe its Guy Ritchie's vision, but this was not at all what I was expecting Sherlock Holmes to be. I found the casting of this film to be a bit peculiar. I didn't feel that Downey and Jude Law really had any chemistry and Rachel McAdams felt more like an annoying little sister rather then a former love of Holmes. The story line is hardly anything to rave about it and I felt bored throughout the entire movie. It's extremely predictable and the twist is nothing that surprising. Of course, I am extremely picky with movies and hardly seem to like anything.",1271894400,29,945,4.425287356321839
2047124,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I've watched this version of Holmes a number of times now, and I must admit it surprises me in its subtlety and intelligence every time. As earlier reviews have noted, in the main this is actually a quite faithful representation of Holmes and Watson in light of the original stories (which I've read and, indeed, taught a number of times). At the same time, it's an excellent stylization of late Victorian England, and I think that's how it should be understood: at once a faithful interpretation that brings out all the pleasures of the original and a commentary on Victorian society as it transitioned into the twentieth century (which is, I'd hold, exactly what Doyle's stories were--a commentary on the modern). To quote from another well-known and frequently-adapted Victorian novel, it's ""nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.""

The structure of the story itself could well be one of Doyle's original stories. It especially reminds me of ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band,"" in which an apparently supernatural series of events turns out to have a logical explanation. This is what surprised me the most when I saw the movie for the first time: that it engaged Doyle's narrative strategies in film form. In fact, this engagement is incredibly detailed. For instance, the scenes early in the movie where Irene Adler visits Holmes at home exploit Doyle's typical doubleness: at first we get a strung-together series of events whose chain of cause and effect are unexplained. Then, later, we get a recap in which Holmes explains that chain in detail, supposedly to Watson but really to the viewing audience. This particular set of scenes is, I think, one of the most admirable in the movie. It works as an exploration of narrative (which was always Doyle's point anyway--see the numerous stories in which Holmes chides Watson for transcribing their ""adventures"" as, exactly, adventures, as opposed to scientific processes of reasoning), and it works so brilliantly because of the intelligence behind it. Even the soundtrack (by Hans Zimmer of Gladiator fame) underscores the narrative structure here: the first time the events are portrayed, they're given a particular musical theme, and when they're re-portrayed by Holmes they're given a theme that's the musical inverse of the original. It's an example of all the various elements of film-making coming together in a subtle and fascinating way to demonstrate a point.

This attention to detail, not to mention stylishness, is present in the entire movie. It has nary a narrative hole (with, I think, one slight exception, which I won't detail so as not to produce any plot spoilers) and its overall structure is admirable taut. In fact, the movie is littered with strikingly subtle details that remain unexplained (e.g. the recurrence of ""V.R."", an abbreviation of ""Victoria Regina,"" or ""Queen Victoria"") by Holmes's narrative explications--the sheer quantity of detail in the movie points to the fascination with, precisely, detail that fascinates Holmes. (To cite just one more example: when Watson hands a newspaper to Holmes early in the movie, it features an ad for ""Fry's Chocolates,"" which was the family business that gave Roger Fry, one of the members of the Bloomsbury Group whose most famous member is Virgina Woolf, his fortune.)

The movie does take liberties with its source material, signally with the representation of Irene Adler. But it acknowledges that it's doing so in a number of clever, apparently offhand details. At one point, Watson notes that Adler has outsmarted Holmes ""twice,"" which indicates that the movie is adding on to the canon of Holmes stories--in Doyle's corpus, Adler appears exactly once (in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""), so Guy Ritchie openly acknowledges the extrapolations he's made in this movie. In short, the movie notes explicitly that it's an adaptation as part of its adaptation.

All of this works brilliantly because the actors are brilliant: Robert Downey Jr. displays his usual genius (shown in another recent action movie), Jude Law presents the kind of Watson that other adaptations have eschewed (an intelligent ladies' man quite in tune with Doyle's character), and Rachel McAdams represents Adler as a clever and daunting adversary, which is quite in keeping with Doyle's character. McAdams may be especially worth noting, as Adler is one of the most significant as well as mysterious characters in the Holmes universe--her character is probably the biggest departure from the original in the movie, and McAdams carries it well. The cinematography is stylish and the soundtrack is excellent and really catchy. There are a couple of faults--some obvious day-for-night shooting and some clear CG--but I'm willing to indulge these because of the movie's overall excellence.

Basically, this movie is exactly what Hollywood used to produce and what it wishes it could achieve now: an intelligent, entertaining, and subtle movie that invites some effort on the viewer's part but also entertains enormously.

Should I leave a bunch of clues and have you, the readers, decipher those clues in your own Holmes-ian manner?  Nah, let me dispense with the suspense there and quickly summarize.  For much of this film I (and my daughter with me) was under the impression that I was watching a Harry Potter film.  The dark arts and such that are featured in much of the film seem to be ripped straight out of some of the more recent Potter films.  Given the amount of money those films have made, it's not that surprising that someone would try to cash in on the popularity of that style and genre, but I'm not so certain that I like Sherlock Holmes in Harry Potter style myself.

Realistically, I admit that I grew up much more a fan of other famous detectives and never quite got into reading that much of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, but still, I expect mystery and intrique in a Sherlock Holmes story and not quite what we got in this Guy Ritchie vision of Holmes.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Holmes was fine, and Jude Law was also fine in the Watson role, but the story itself rather bored me (and my daughter for that matter) and left me thinking this just isn't the kind of film that I'd want to make a purchase of.

I had never imagined in my head that Watson and Holmes would be ""tough guys"", but they are the Holmes and Watson for the new millennium! Rachel McAdams' character seemed a little pointless. She was there for the pretty factor but really didn't affect much of the plot.

Now that we are speaking of the plot - it really left a lot to be desired. There was an aspect of the paranormal that was included, which ended up being explained - but it really didn't fit with my impression of Sherlock Holmes stories. They could have had a perfectly good plotline without the paranormal.

I get the feeling that there will definitely be a sequel - based on the way the ending played out.  But if there is, I hope they go back to basics a little more.

I CANT WAIT for the sequal that i'm assuming pretty much without a doubt will be coming (at least it BETTER BE) based on the end of this one!",1271721600,2,1564,4.396551724137931
2047133,4,B0001Z3TS4,"One could debate the finer points of Holmesian lore till we're all blue in the face, so I will dispense with the issue entirely.

This is a fine, entertaining action film.  The pacing is brisk, the dialogue wastes few words.  It's all very scenic and gloomy and rainy, and, I suppose, Londonish, though how much is CGI, and how well it reflects the historical London I do not venture to say.

Downey provides us with an interesting interpretation of Holmes, which is full of eccentricity, though somewhat shadowed by seeming the slightest bit adolescent.  It's a bit disconcerting, too, to see Watson portrayed by an actor who is in reality several years younger than the man playing Holmes, but only because I am so used to Watson seeming the elder.

The main pitfall of the film, of course, is that people are occasionally beaten over the head, when they are not being shot, or jumping out of second story windows, or diving from even higher elevations into the Thames, and they inevitably pop up fit as a fiddle, with nary a drop of blood to intrude on the fantasy.

Well, alright, there is one scene with a catastrophic tone, which results in one of the main players at least ""appearing"" moderately injured, but the effect is transitory and our ""worst fears"" are quickly proved unnecessary.

If you consider Jeremy Brett to have done more to bring Holmes to life than Conan Doyle himself, as do I, then you may see in this film not a challenger to the throne, but rather a different animal altogether, and one you may well enjoy for the newish perspective it offers.",1271635200,3,1570,4.64259927797834

The story is about a person who seems to have supernatural powers and tries to bandy together a group of loyalists from the parliament to control the country.  My daughter watched the movie and shouted, mid-way, ""Dad, this is black magic!"".  The 'black magic' is extremely convincing.  And when Sherlock Holmes explains all the supernatural phenomena, my daughter was completely flabbergasted.  She did say, ""Dad, there is no black magic - everything has to have a reason"".  IF any movie can send that message to children, I think it has more than achieved its objective.  On the side, I watched the movie before she did and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.

It's hard for me to determine if my dislike for the film was a result of the total recasting of Holmes and Watson or the absurdly inappropriate film techniques (that owe more to the Matrix than to Masterpiece Theater).

The jagged, quick cut edits and gimmicky ""stop action"" sequences detracted from the story telling to the point where they became the center of attraction. When that happens, the egos of the director and the cinematographer intrude. They're playing games with the film -- if they want to be the stars, let them get jobs as actors. The juxtaposition of such by-now-cliched action film techniques with the historical setting was jarring and made the movie seem more comic-book like than was probably intended.

Even if I could get past the annoying film techniques, I couldn't buy Robert Downey Jr as Holmes. For more than a century, Sherlock Holmes has been an iconic figure -- brooding, cool, and cerebral. Downey's Holmes appears borderline psychotic, a kind of disturbed (and disturbing) Victorian Batman complete with flying cape. Holmes is seldom a ""likeable"" fellow in the original books and in films, but this version was repulsive and scarey.

I know film makers today feel they have to be ""edgy"" (heaven forbid a main character should smile!) but personally I prefer my protagonists to have at least a few redeeming qualities and for the emphasis to be on the story rather than the presentation of a ""Blair Witch"" visual roller-coaster ride.",1271462400,10,1587,4.958646616541353

This Sherlock lacks the intellect yet manages to annoy everyone including Dr Watson with his arrogance and lack of courtesy.  To be sure Holmes has always been an insufferable bore at times, but this version is about making Hollywood money and does not concern itself with trivial matters such as staying true to the character.

The new formula in Hollywood is take existing super heros and remake them into unstopable super heros appealing to the mindless teenage audiance of today that craves more special effects and less substance.  A dumbing down if you will.  How many times can you remake Batman?  It appears the answer is there is no end in sight.  The formula for movie success today is the blockbuster.  Ironman, Superman, Spiderman, the Hulk, Transformers and blah blah blah.  I'm sick of the blockbuster movie formula.  Strong tough guy with a tender spot for a hot girl, who kicks ass and together take on the villians.

Most of the movies today lack any real originality, or if they do are shunned by the younger audiance if there is too much emphasis on the character and not enough on the action.  Thank God there is Pixar which still makes family films that attract a large audiance.

This movie did well I'm sure at the box office to attract the intended audiance to make a sequel or two.  Whereas there is more detective work in a Harry Potter film than this film will ever have.

While there are a lot of things I could nitpick about this movie, overall I found it quite interesting to see a very different (than what most people define as SH) version.

Who will like this movie is a good question.
If you are like me and pretty much like every variety of Sherlock Holmes then you should like this movie. If you are a Holmes purist regarding the originals then you might also like the movie. If you believe however that Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett is the ""real"" Holmes then you probably will take exception to this movie. It is also quite obvious from some of the reviewers that they have a rather narrow expectation of Sherlock Holmes, if this is your case then skip this movie.

To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what this Guy Ritchie's 2009 version of Sherlock Holmes accomplishes.

I have seen quotes suggesting that Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is ""a travesty to the character that Conan Doyle created"" and one particularly funny quote suggesting that ""Robert Downey replacing Rathbone in Holmes was akin replacing Clark Gable with Eminem for a remake of Gone With the Wind."" But look, to me as long as the result is good I couldn't care less if a director takes liberties with what was originally created in print or on screen. I thought Downey made an excellent Holmes...but I doubt that I'd feel the same way with Eminem in Gone With the Wind. :-)

In Ritchie's 2009 version of Holmes some if not most of the original's storyline is a bit...well...remade, but the remake gives this classic a beautiful 21st century treatment with good FX and cool scenery. It's full of action that made the 2-hour length of the movie go by before I was ready for an end.

2047160,4,B0001Z3TS4,"The first thing to say is that I really did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. However, there are points this review will touch on which I just didn't find fit in with the Sherlock Holmes universe. To take such an iconic character, and put a modern Hollywood twist to it, would undoubtedly generate some criticism from those who have read the original stories and are fans of the traditional Arthur Conan Doyle creation. Although there have been many incarnations of Sherlock Holmes in the cinema, this is the first to give Sherlock Holmes the big budget blockbuster panache that some thought would work well. As a stand-alone, the film worked well, but in comparison to one of literatures greatest creations, it just didn't work.

The film naturally focuses on Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson who are faced with possibly their most challenging investigation ever. Lord Blackwood, a serial killer who is executed for his crimes rises from the grave and is determined to use his supernatural powers to become leader of the British Empire and inevitably the world. Holmes has to use every facet of his talents to solve this mystery as he is faced with the supernatural, which he deems to be irrational. With the help of his friend Dr. Watson and a supporting cast of other great names in the novels such as Irene Adler and Inspector Letrade, Holmes works to solve one of the greatest mysteries he has undoubtedly ever faced.

Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but I felt it was too much and diverged too far away from the character in the books to the point it felt that the film was just capitalising on a familiar name. Guy Ritchie has accomplished something of worth, however, in that he has put one of my favourite literary characters on the silver screen and managed to make him cool. One thing I will point out which, although insignificant, makes all the difference to fans of the novels perceptions of the film. The very appearance of Holmes is something out of place with the era that he is meant to be representing. The absence of the deerstalker hat in favour of a fedora, although a small difference is something that I thought looked too contrived. An attempt to make the character look cool to draw favour from the image obsessed modern culture whilst insulting the fans of the novels who took the time to get to know the characters traits and his appearance.

The actors for their respective roles did well. Mark Strong as the antagonist, Lord Blackwood made for a very intimidating foe. His mannerisms, appearance and dialogue formed a very definite character in considering his purpose and mission in the film. Not being much of a fan of Jude Law in general, I was critical of the man going into this film, but I found myself enjoying his performance and appreciating the fact that he makes the perfect on screen Dr. Watson. The big discussion though is about whether or not Downey Jr. performed well in the role as Sherlock Holmes. In a lot of ways, he did really well. Some of the characters mannerisms we performed as you'd expect them and he just presented an all round realistic portrayal of Holmes, however, the accent didn't really work for me as it appeared as the typical way the British accent would be portrayed in a Hollywood blockbuster.

The setting of 19th century London was superb and overall, as I mentioned above, on its own, the film did a great job of providing two hours of good entertainment. I think a worthy alternative for Downey Jr. would have been Hugh Laurie taking on the iconic role. He is both experienced in playing a character based on Holmes, has a superb, natural British accent and is also known worldwide in one way or another whether that be for his work on House or his other work on UK TV. I would recommend this as a decent bit of light entertainment and the nods to the book are a welcome wink to fans of Conan Doyles literary creation.",1270944000,4,3915,4.604584527220631
2047161,5,B0001Z3TS4,"With pure curiosity I read the reviews with one star. I wondered how this movie would get just one star. My parents have been long fans of Sherlock Holmes so it is a character I grew up with. My Father was big in to the original Literary novels and my Mother loved the Jeremy Brett television version. I have seen that and the Basil Rathbone version and I loved this. The literary Character was troubled with a drug addiction and still was able to use such an amazing mind to figure out the most minute details. I feel that this movie gave a fair representation of the character even though there are several who will disagree. Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock is more into the drugs than Sir Conan Doyle's but it still leaves you in awe that a Character so blitzed out of his mind has the most impressive deductive reasoning.

The movie was in my opinion very well written and the Plot was one that pulls you in form the beginning and doesn't let go till the very end. The ending even left it open for a sequel that I can't wait for and I have heard nothing to the sort that they are even going to do a sequel. Some may disagree with this statement and to each his own, but I was happy to see a more literary Sherlock Holmes when I was expecting a more modern action hero from what the previews led on. That being said the fight scenes are a bit comical at times but a bit of light hearted humor is always welcome in such a serious setting. What interested me in these scenes was that you get to watch it play out in Holmes' head and he will voice over the reason for his choice of attacks. He even explains the duration of recovery time the attack will take.

To anyone who has enjoyed Sherlock Holmes I recommend this movie and to those who have not heard of the character or know little about him, this is a great opportunity to be introduced to some of the best Literature ever.

To feel the need to bring a classic such as Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century by totally dumbing down the plot and the characters with a totally incredulous story line is akin to remaking Gone With The Wind starring Eminem.
Right from the start, the irritating, grainy, colour-washed graphics and overcooked CGI, the mumbling dialogue and slapstick fight scenes make this a truly laughable (in a truly pathetic sense) production.  One of the most amazing features of this film is the total inability of the director to generate any sort of rapport with any of the characters!!  Genius!!  How did he do it?

This latest flick was a good attempt. It had the right amount of action and interesting concept...but the plot was too scoobydoo-ish and uninteresting atleast that's how I felt about it. Not a bad movie... just one that could have used a more interesting story. The action scenes were always overshadowed by the ""zzzzzzz"" plot that wasn't worth caring about. Maybe if they dropped the cartoonish back from the dead plot and added in something with a bit more of a serious tone the movie would have been great...you know like Lethal Weapon good with Danny and Mel. A semi comdey with serious action in it. I didn't care too much for the ambigious relationship holmes had with watson...for the moment I thought Holmes wanted watson to plant the ring on his finger.

Decent film... worth watching... renting... maybe owning if it's cheap.

Just average film though.

P.S. I'd like to add that I couldn't understand half of what ""Sherlock Iron Man Holmes"" said as his thick forced british accent and mumbling made him sound like a mix between Jack Sparrow,the Dark Knight, and Mr. Belvedere (thats right I took it to the 80's).",1270771200,,1291,4.7757847533632285

In fact, this 2009 incarnation feels like a Victorian-era version of ""The Wild Wild West"" (and I mean that as a compliment). Downey's fitfully eccentric interpretation of the iconic detective is well-matched by Law's refreshingly non-bumbling Dr. Watson.

2047169,4,B0001Z3TS4,"The new Sherlock Homes movie was a very well done, action oriented movie.  I will say up front that I am biased to Robert Downey Junior.  Ever since ""Less than Zero"" when he played the out of touch with reality drug addict gone bad, I have been amazed at his acting skills.  I will say if you take Tony Stark from ""Iron Man"", give him a pipe and fill him with drugs, then send him back in time, you basically have the same character.  There isn't a lot of deviation from one to the other.  Damn, maybe Tony Stark smokes Heroine as well.

Sherlock Holmes, as always, is in the middle of solving a crime.  He is physically fit and tackles as many obstacles with his fist as he does his brains.  Dr. Watson is adeptly played by Jude Law who does an adequate job performing his sidekick duties.  Rachel McAdams simply has to be in a picture for me to love it.  The girl is flat out hot, and keeps your interest as the female lead of the story.  She as well doesn't sit back on her laurels, but has the ability to kick somebody's ass just like the guys.  Be warned to all the muggers who might try and take her purse in the alley.

Setting the action aside the story is a little weak.  The bad guy dies in the beginning, then returns from the grave in an attempt to take over parliament.  I think that was his goal.  It was a little shaky on what exactly he was trying to accomplish.  I did fully get that he wanted everyone dead, who was not on his side.  In that capacity, he had invented a machine to distributed chemicals in order to kill a large body of people.  I wonder if he was going to sell this to the Middle East shortly after proving it worked.

I think the reason this movie was enjoyable is completely based on the acting abilities of everyone involved and the wonderfully choreographed action sequences.  I loved the scenes where Sherlock Holmes would plan his physical assault on unsuspecting opponents down to each blow, and then follow through.  It made me feel as if I was as intoxicated as he was when the actual assault began.

Bottom line, if you like action movies with good acting this is a great movie to see.  If you are interested in a detective movie with a great mystery you will be disappointed.  This is not your old Sherlock Holmes who did it version.  This is the kick your ass while I am wasted story, even if I have to sink an entire shipyard to do it.",1270598400,2,2383,4.24
2047170,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I finally got a chance to see this much-hyped version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character and after all is said and done, this was most entertaining.

Robert Downey Jr was an inspired choice especially when considering Guy Ritchie is at the helm.  Downey perfectly fits Ritchie's frenetic vision of the legendary detective and the casting of Jude Law as a much more energized Dr. Watson is just wonderful.  Law's Dr. Watson is infinitely more his own man than any Watson I've witnessed before.  The chemistry between Downey and Law served the project quite well.

The set design is amazing making this a visual delight.  The costumes and sets combined with Ritchie's energetic and rather imaginative editing all combine to create the perfect mood to accompany this action-packed, fun-filled ride.

To be sure, the plot was rather muddled, rather busy, and rather ambitious which is also rather deftly camouflaged by the almost non-stop action.  Sherlock still remains the highly analytical, precise, and logical detective we all know and love but is refreshingly and delightfully encased in the always interesting Downey who is more than complemented by Law's more deliberate Watson.

Some viewers felt that this version made a travesty of Doyle's original vision of Holmes. To each his own.  Seeing this in no way at all diminished (or elevated for that matter) my perception of Holmes.  Hey, guys, get over it!! - its only a character for godsakes!!!  By that very definition, a character is subject to as many interpretations as is necessary, making each perspective, whether you like it or not, just as valid as the next one.

2047172,4,B0001Z3TS4,"It seems that Hollywood is obsessed with reviving old tales with new twists. I should start by saying, if you are a Holmes purist, you probably won't enjoy this movie. Sherlock is depicted ingeniously as ever, but this time he's got a knack for the boxing ring and a bit of a naughty side. Watson has some money management issues, but is otherwise the nagging voice of reason that supports Holmes.

In terms of visual appeal, the movie is pretty spectacular. If you, like me, only opt for High Def when a movie really warrants it and stick with DVDs the remainder of the time, I'd recommend going HD with this one.

The soundtrack is a bit... annoying. Holmes is no longer a classical violinist, but like to finger pick his violin... at times to test it's affect on animals. The suspense generating fingerpicking of the violin plays heavily into the soundtrack and actually distracted me a time or two from what was happening.

To watch this movie, I had to initially come to terms with the transition in Holmes' character. He is not the Holmes of old. He is a darker, somewhat depraved variation of the beloved sleuth. If you really want to get the full effect of the film, you have to know that going in and open your mind to a new vision of Sherlock Holmes. Once I did this, I started to see the merits of the movie. The characters have a larger than life feel about them, the plot has plenty of suspense and twists, there is an element of the occult, a strong underpinning of science, and some humorous moments as well.

It also, surprisingly had some replay value. The end reveals aspects of the plot I didn't notice on the first run. When I gave it a second watch I noticed considerably more.

My vote- definitely worth a rent. If you like visually appealing movies, detective movies, or something Douglass Preston/Lincoln Childish... you may want to consider purchasing it.

2047174,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Based on the most famous private detective, or possibly, the most famous fictional character in the world, Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" looks like Gorge Roy Hill's buddy-buddy movies, or more recently, Walter Hill's ""48 Hrs."" Action-paced, breakneck adventures with a health amount of humor, ""Sherlock Holmes"" may not be the most faithful adaptation to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's source material, but it is a hugely entertaining action thriller.

Set in late Victorian London, the fast-paced story follows the adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his recently engaged sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law). They have to stop the diabolical plot of mysterious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who seeks to change the course of the world forever.

In ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) the world's greatest sleuth and his partner look much younger than in other versions. The Holmes of Robert Downey Jr. is not exactly the same as elegant Jeremy Brett's. They are both smart and witty, but the newer one looks more like a James Bond or Philip Marlowe with a messy hair, always ready to fight with his fists. Jude Law's Watson is more resourceful than the original. The pair is really fun to watch.

Three female characters appear: Mrs. Hudson (Geraldine James), Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), Watson's fiance, and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), the only woman who ever has touched Holmes' heart. Sadly the first two characters have little to do in Guy Ritchie's new adaptation. Rachel McAdams fares a little better as wily Irene Adler, but still it seems as if the director is not really interested her character.

The film's crew includes famous names: photography by Philippe Rousselot (""A River Runs Through it""); costume design by Jenny Beavan (""A Room with a View""); production design by Sarah Greenwood (""Pride & Prejudice""); and set decoration by Katie Spencer (""Pride & Prejudice""). Hans Zimmer's unique music, slightly overused, is still impressive.

The rather silly screen story was hatched by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson (who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg) and despite the general lack of resemblance of Ritchie's concept of a messy, hygiene-challenged sot of a Holmes (as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr) the overall result is a Victorian London come alive in a richly colorful way.  Jude Law is placed in the shoes of Dr. Watson and makes them fit despite the original's more dignified persona.  And the ever present quintessential evil - Professor Moriarty - becomes a rather excessively far-fetched immortal presence of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), his accomplice is one Lord Coward (Hans Mathesen).  Rachel Mc Adams adds to the flavor of Ritchie's kickboxing fast forward fighting Irene Adler,  and Watson's affianced Mary Morstan is a look-quickly-before-she-disappears Kelly Reilly.

To be fair much of the original smart and sharp witted conversations and mind-workings of Holmes have been preserved: the dialog of the author's style comes in quickly delivered digressions amongst the explosions and CGI effects.

Basil Rathbone-type Sherlock Holmes from the 30's & 40's is in for
a rude awakening! Guy Ritchie, the brilliant high-octane very stylized
director or ""Rock N' Rolla"" and ""Snatch"" fame, takes the helm and takes
the classic characters into the 21st Century with a bang while being very
true to the London in the 1890's time period in which all the original
Sherlock Holmes stories took place.
Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant as the genius sleuth, bringing a quirkiness
and physical edge to it which made it very uniquely his own interpetation.
But then that's just what makes Robert Downey Jr's work so special,
because he has been doing that for over 25 yrs now.
My only point of contention with his performance is in his very affected
1890's London accent...sometimes it was just too affected until you
really had to strain and turn up the volume to understand what he was saying!

Now Jude Law on the hand, an actual born and bred Londoner,
I understood everything he said without a problem! (-:
I loved Jude Law's rendition of Dr. Watson because his Watson
kicks ass and asks questions later!
No mere second banana, he is good-looking, physically fit,
a lover of the ladies, and he'll even go toe to toe with his buddy Holmes,
matching wits & theories. Ultimately though, Holmes is on another wavelength
of genius with his deductive reasoning, powers of observation, and his
razor-sharp timing in bringing it all home in the end.

menace & flair to the film.

It attempted to create a wizard out of Holmes, and instead made viewers wondering how they could have been taken in by the ads. The film bore no relationship to the Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This 'divorce from reality' was compounded by a number of scenes attempting to show Holmes as a master of action/fisticuffs (quasi 'Lethal Weapon"") - carried to such inane and inconsistent levels that even teenagers would be put off. As for the plot, an 18th century version of a James Bond movie villain attempting world takeover, it also lacked credibility; it was also difficult to understand the mumbling dialogue. Finally, in a final attempt to somehow cover up all the silliness, the audience is also 'treated' to 18th-century science-fiction involving transmitted signals, and some sort of quasi-romance involving Holmes and the former leading bad girl.

I've always appreciated the kind of grit and quirky comradery Guy Ritchie writes into his films, but all his previous efforts have been gangster titles. Here we have something different -- a detective story. And I think doing a Sherlock movie was a great choice because of two things: 1) Ritchie infusing his unique style into the film, and 2) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation of Holmes, which resulted in the creation of Gregory House, which looks to have resulted in the re-recreation of Sherlock Holmes via Guy Ritchie. Aesthetically and literally, Holmes isn't anything new. It has elements of action, comedy, drama, thriller, and mystery, but what really catches me is the relationship between Holmes and Watson. For any of you who watch House M.D., I'm sure you know of the relationship House has with Wilson. The parallels between obsession and perfection in one's craft, the possession of sheer brilliance, the tough exterior with a fragile interior, and quirky intimacy between oneself and a good friend (or in this case, ""bromance"") is a combination of attributes I've really come to appreciate the past few years I've been watching House and now noticing in Holmes. I stopped paying attention to Downey Jr. during his rut of bad boy and alcohol days. But after seeing him in some great roles lately, namely from: Iron Man, Tropic Thunder, The Soloist, and Zodiac, he's starting to become one of my favorite actors. Jude Law (as obsessed as Seth Rogen appears to be with him) also does a great job as Watson. Like Wilson is to House, Watson compliments Holmes and gives him that down-to-earth quality required to make the movie as enjoyable as it is. Ritchie ultimately manages to input that time in spurts, though, giving just enough interaction to make it fun when it's there, but not too much to take away from the plot. Ah, and the sequel. While Mark Strong (whom I'm slightly obsessed with myself after seeing his performance in Body of Lies), plays an admirable villain as Lord Blackwood, the prospect of Moriarty in the next movie is something I really look forward to. If Ritchie can maintain the quirkiness and carry it into the battle of wits and intellect that accompany the rivalry of Moriarty, this may turn into a definite all-time favorite series for me. So here's hoping to that.

Video - 4.0

Because of the art direction and distinct photography, Holmes' video quality is a bit of a mixed bag. The monochromatic color palette gives the film a very Victorian feel, but doesn't amount to much vibrancy aside from Adler's pink dress when her character is introduced. There's a lot of grey, black, and dark blue used in the costuming, and while it's a good reflection of the period itself, I wouldn't say it's a bad transfer necessarily. It's just not the kind of video quality that will wow Blu-ray viewers. With that said, there are also a few instances of crush, bleeding, and inconsistent contrast levels when all the dark clothing kind of blends into itself a little too much. On the other hand, detail is fine, fleshtones are accurate (albeit, a little on the pale side), black levels are deep, and there isn't a whole lot of digital noise or any image manipulation to speak of. It's a very good transfer that reflects the period well, but as a presentation on BD isn't anything spectacular.

Audio - 5.0

The overall design makes for some great immersion both in sound effects and music. Hans Zimmer's score is well-balanced and never overwhelms, complimenting the fun and adventurous mood very nicely. Dialogue is clear and focused in the center channel, though you may want to watch the film with subs until you get used to Downey's accent. Dynamic range is excellent as well, most notably in the slaughterhouse scene where Blackwood's voice is circling the entire sound field. And LFEs are booming during flashback, epiphany, and ""Holmes-o-vision"" cuts and especially in the shipyard scene. Considering the scope of the plot and the fact that it's a Sherlock Holmes movie, I give a lot of credit to Ritchie and the film's sound team for creating a very cool experience.

Extras - 4.0

While I own Watchmen and Terminator Salvation as well, Holmes is actually the first chance I've had time to try and watch Warner Bros. Maximum Movie Mode, and I have to say it's pretty cool. Guy Ritchie does an excellent job explaining his intentions and a lot of the technical jargon that accompanied the filming process (in a nice suit to boot). There are also cuts and splices of the Focus Points and ""Reinventing Holmes"" feature as well that flow very well with MMM. My only complaint, though, is that the FP and RH features tend to rehash a lot of what was already said in MMM, and I was a little disappointed in the amount of dead space during the feature as well. But nonetheless, it still makes for a very engaging and informative experience that beats most regular commentaries.

Overall 4.5

I'm happy that they picked Guy Ritchie to give the franchise of Sherlock Holmes a new and contemporary look. It's as gritty and quirky as lot of his other hits and is probably the funnest of his films I've seen thus far, thanks in huge part to the character/actor chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. A sequel is inevitable at this point, but I personally hope they turn it into a possible trilogy. The video is good, but not great, the audio is reference, and the Maximum Movie Mode shows a lot of potential for future big-name titles. If you like Ritchie or House M.D., I highly recommend you give this a watch.",1270166400,2,5561,4.748447204968944
2047187,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Overall I thought this was a good film.  The cinematography was dark and gritty and gave a perceived notion of London during the time period.  The characters were nicely portrayed as well and their clothes and costumes reflected the time period well.  Authenticity was definitely there.  The music was fitting although at times I didn't seem to notice it as it was mostly instrumental.

The casting was done appropriately.  Robert Downey Jr plays Sherlock Holmes with his faithful sidekick Watson (Jude Law).  I did however think that Watson was a much more engaging and interesting character than Holmes in this.  While Holmes had plenty of quirks and eccentricities, Watson had more connect-ability and personality.  Other characters included Mark Strong, who plays Lord Blackwood.  He does a great job and makes for a formidable enemy, although for some reason his teeth really bothered me (but that could be my own quirk). Rachael McAdams plays Irene Adler, Holmes on and off again lady love who has foiled him numerous times.  There are other characters, but they don't play as strong of a role in the film.

The premise starts with Holmes and Watson rushing in to save a girl from ritual sacrifice.  This leads to the capture and subsequent hanging of Lord Blackwood.  Soon it is discovered that by some means, Blackwood has risen from the dead.  It is up to Holmes to find him and stop him in his next plan, a plan that could end up with many people dying.

During the course of the movie there are many fight scenes and action adventure type happenings.  However, despite this, the film progresses slowly at parts.  It seems to drag when there is no action happening.

Overall I'd say this movie is worth seeing. It has an intriguing plot line (even if it takes forever to get through it) and interesting characters.  Having never read the books I can't say for sure whether or not it follows the stories or stays true to the characters, but on its own it was worthwhile.",1270166400,3,1979,4.747800586510264

Overall very enjoyable.",1270166400,,464,5.216216216216216

I wanted to see this movie so bad because I have always been a fan of Holmes and of course of Robert Downey Jr. So I was a bit disappointed when I missed it in the theaters and had to wait for the DVD/Blu Ray release and all that. So as I waited some things went down but eventually it was released. So naturally I went out and had to own this even without seeing it. Still that didn't matter we all wanted to see it so off we went to view the new Holmes movie. So was it worth a purchase or did I waste my money, we will see I guess.

Of course you know the story follows Holmes [Downey] and his partner in crime {fighting} Watson [Jude Law] and their adventures. This time around Watson is on his way out since he is getting married, Holmes is none to happy about that. So with their biggest case in the books when they catch Lord Blackwood [Mark Strong] it becomes their last together. That is of course until Blackwood seems to return from the grave and black magic seems to fill the streets. Holmes of course is to intrigued to not investigate and Watson seems to not be able to let it go either. So off they go on what once again is their biggest case and potentially their last together.

There is a lot to like about this movie and for starters it stars Downey who is always excellent and Jude Law. Downey makes for the perfect Sherlock Holmes with his witty yet off style of detection. You could tell this was just a fun role for him and the same can be said about Law. I thought he did an excellent job on this film matching Downey and was really funny. Mark Strong was great as the lead villain in this film and played it perfectly and Rachel McAdams was great as well [and looking really good]. All in all I would say that the performances were all very fun and all did a good job.

Also I have always loved the time period this was set in and the look and feel of it. The filmmakers did a great job in that department as well. Director Guy Ritchie I am sure went into this trying to make an intriguing and entertaining film. He did do that for the most part but the movie failures are covered at least in my opinion by how fun it was. Written by four different writers I would say the script is probably were the trouble laid. All had different ideas I am sure and therefore made the film feel overloaded at times, and not fully explored at others. Still it is an entertaining film that I found funny.

Was this a perfect movie, no, but like I said it was still a very fun one that I am sure will produce a sequel. Hopefully the next one will be just as entertaining and fun but with a little added substance. I say buy it if you into these kinda films because I am glad I got it. Some people this may be just a rental but I think you will like it. I do recommend this film but go in just wanting to be entertained, just have fun with it.",1270166400,3,2868,4.087033747779751
2047193,3,B0001Z3TS4,"I think the initial reaction to the casting of Robert Downey Jr. for SH must have been like the announcement that Michael Keaton would play Batman back in the 1980s. But then again, Robert Downey Jr. used 'Ironman' to transform himself from quirky troubled actor to mainstream leading man star. So perhaps most were not so surprised.

First, the good things about this film: (1) Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make a great comic team, and much of their interaction is very funny. (2) Lots of elaborate sets, soiled costumes and CGI to give us 'gritty detail' of what London might have been like for both the very rich and the far more numerous poor. (3) A story that seems to say, what IF, SH and Dr. W. were REAL people (at least in the imaginary universe of this film) and were somewhat different than the literary portrayal Watson gives in the universe of the stories (afterall, SH often complained about Watson's write-ups).

Next the bad things about this film: (1) Robert Downey Jr. turns this into a star vehicle, and Jude Law holds his own as the other half of the partnership, but the depictions are simply too far from the literary sources and too close in time to the recent memory of Jeremy Brett's dominating, absoulutely brilliant and extensive portrayal of SH. (2) What is the point of such QUASI-authentic detail if the film itself is stuck with such a wild fantasy and ludicrous plot? (It is true that Conan Doyle brought elements of gothic, macabre and the supernatural into the stories, but this film is more Wild, Wild West than Conan Doyle). (3) In attempting to re-do SH and Dr. W., the makers of this film admirably revive some little-known or nearly-forgotten aspects of the characters and stories, but they then squeeze far too many such aspects into far too little time (it might work in a revisionist mini-series, but haven't we already had these, at least in a way, such as a mini-series about Arthur Conan Doyle's younger days). (4) This is very much a Guy Ritchie film where he drags out a lot of his usual moves and camera techniques--if you love that, fine, but if you are here for a new version of SH, it often proves distracting, repetitious and silly.

The SH stories themselves alternated between urban and rural settings (the 'manor' mysteries). And perhaps the greatest SH story is actually one of the greatest full-length detective novels of all time, The Hound of the Baskervilles. It is a manor mystery, not a London story.

Ultimately, what holds back this Ritchie project from greatness is what dooms film versions of our favorite comic action heroes. Their ongoing serial nature. These heroes and their stories might be better told in a series with many episodes, but outside of animation, the economics of film-making and TV programming do not support the genre very well (with a few exceptions, such as 'The Flash' and 'Smallville'). They do not make great complete-in-themselves 2-hour films. Raimi tried with Spiderman with mixed results by the third installment. This SH series will come undone when Robert Downey Jr. or Jude Law get tired with the roles.",1270080000,2,3104,4.774674115456238
2047194,4,B0001Z3TS4,"It just dawned on me that the characters are simply similar to those we see on the show House. Neither person be whole or healthy but together an interesting team. Holmes is a brilliant man with logic and deduction, but lacking care for proper hygiene and has horrible social skills. Watson, although endowed with a respectable job, is flawed in his relationships with women and money. Out of some twisted obligation to one another, they seem powerless to ever really separate for long. They are like the archetypes in both show/movie plots. Funny.

The cinematography and use of flash backs and forwards to create resolution is playfully well done and interesting. You're not left completely out of the loop whilst the dysfunctional duo is attempting to solve the mystery behind the resurrection of an evil mastermind/religious zealot. Obviously, you have to suspend disbelieve and just enjoy the ride.

That being said, I found this to be a quite gritty, tenacious holding to the original text. I'm not sure how he does it, but Guy Ritchie found just the right actors, dialogue, stylists, and set designers to make this an ebullient gem. You can almost smell the cordite, creosote, coal smoke, dried roses, and dank rooms in this film. Mr Downey Jr.'s performance was admirable and well-played and Mr. Law was delightfully restrained and an intensely strong performer, as per his usual performances.

Robert Downey Jr. played himself. Which is great usually, but Holmes is too iconic a figure for that to work this time. His love interest seems to exist primarily to dispel any jokes or even ideas that Watson and Holmes are gay, which certainly they would seem without her presence. Holmes is also not the dry, tortured and grave protagonist of the books, he's more like a spoiled child who knows he can get away with anything. Further, the plot is silly. At the core of every Holmes adventure should be empirical science (that's what makes him so brilliant), and this leans too heavily on the magical side.

Downey and Law are brilliant as Holmes and Watson and I sincerely hope the next time they pair up to do one of these it is going to be the pre-quel to this film.  The mystery behind who's committing murder in Victorian London.  Because that is a much more intriguing premise than this rather tiresome piece.  The special effects are grand.  Really good.  But as with so many modern films, special effects are being used in lieu of story or to bolster up a tired script.  With economies melting down in part due to government mismanagement both here and in the U.K., does anyone really care whether or not the Houses of Parliment are done away with?  I mean as a story line?  I don't think so.  And the over used and now very tiresome addition of ""chemical warfare"" which we have heard way too much about in the last 8 years in real life and on film comes off like a last minute solution for a quick wrap.

Do yourself a favor and rent or buy Basil Rathbone's Holmes film ""The Scarlet Claw"".  A terrific thriller.  Or Rupert Everett's two films as Holmes.  Or Jeremy Brett's many films and series. But I suggest you pass on this creation and bug the movie company to come out with a pre quel and Downey as Holmes doing some serious and realistic detective work.

By the way, the actress who played the villain ""Irene"" comes off as about as dangerous as a cream puff.  All the fancy footwork and such does not a villain make.  Irene was scarey because of who she was and how she was to Holmes and the society she lived in.  NOT because she knew judo or whatever.  As for Watson's fiancee role, was that actress playing her even breathing?  What a lackluster performance from an actress I have watched before simply steal scenes in other films.

I was hoping for something terrific.  But once again, the old addage, ""older is better"" is proven.  Holmes was Holmes before martial arts, inane plots, and special effects.  And his stories were compelling in book form and on the screen because they were GOOD stories.  A very simple idea.  K.I.S.S.  And then some!",1269993600,7,2171,4.403022670025189

I also liked the menacing introduction of Professor Moriarty - a clear staging for a sequel if Ive ever seen one.

I love Holmes in general, from Doyle's finely written stories to the portrayals by Rathbone and Brett, my two favorite screen Sherlocks. While I wouldn't place this Guy Ritchie effort in that league, it comes close and is in any case entertaining and a very fine dose of eye candy; the CGI rendering of 1891 London is excellent, dark and foreboding and almost fog-free! That may be a Holmes first.

The highlights are the scenes with Law and Downey together; their interplay is quick and sharp and quite faithful to Doyle, as is the exclusion of the deerstalker cap. Downey lacks the air of deep intelligence that Rathbone and Brett convey so masterfully, but makes up for it with a dry wit and good form in the action scenes. There is indeed plenty of action here, more than perhaps any other Holmes, and it's all typically well-shot by Ritchie, who's sharper than he's been since Snatch. His take on Holmes is fun to watch, and while it's no masterpiece, it's a decent showing, though I must admit to occasional, fond thoughts of The Seven Percent Solution while watching this, as well as the prototypical Holmes, Rathbone, who I'm now going to watch for the nth time in Dressed To Kill before sleep overtakes.

If you're a fan of Holmes, Downey, Law, Ritchie, McAdams, or/and action thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this.",1269993600,2,1335,4.745689655172414
2047204,4,B0001Z3TS4,"If your idea of Sherlock Holmes comes from the Jeremy Brett, British TV series of the 1980s and 1990s or perhaps from the series of films starring Basil Rathbone, Director Guy Ritchie gives us a Holmes reinvented for the 21st century.  Now ordinarily hearing how a character has been reinvented or re-imagined might send you screaming out of the theater but such is not the case with ""Sherlock Holmes"" starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role.  While modernizing the feel of the character, Ritchie also embraces the original vision of author Arthur Conan Doyle perhaps more than any other adaptation.

As described by Dr. John Watson in Doyle's original texts, Holmes was an expert boxer, swordsman, and master of the ""singlestick"" a martial arts form utilizing a wooden stick, such as a walking stick, as a weapon.  Holmes was also versed in a form of Japanese wrestling he referred to as ""Baritsu"".  Ritchie embraces these aspects of the character to full effect, with Holmes relying on his fists almost as much as his mind.  And while not actually stated, Holmes' addiction to cocaine, legal at the time in England, is hinted at strongly.

The film opens with a bang with Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) are on the trail of the man responsible for the ritual murders of several women in 1891 London.  The killer is revealed as the prominent Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is captured and hanged, but not before he gives Holmes an ominous warning.  Three days later, Blackwood's tomb is destroyed from the inside and the groundskeeper tells the local constables that he saw Blackwood returned to life.  Holmes and Watson, along with sometimes Holmes love interest Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) work to uncover the secret behind Blackwood's dark arts before he can make good on his threat to kill the members of the House of Lords and plunge England into chaos.

As mentioned this is a different Holmes than were used to seeing but in many ways the most faithful to Conan Doyle's stories.  He is arrogant and enjoys figuring out things that befuddle the police but he is basically a loner outside of friendship with Watson.  His demeanor is cold as his penchant for observation and deduction is off-putting to most other people.  And yet you can see his reliance and affection for Watson as the grounding figure in his life.  When Watson announces his impending marriage to Mary Morstan, Holmes is clearly jealous.  Downey and Law have a wonderful chemistry...their scenes together are filled with witty and often humorous repartee.

Ritchie has created a remarkable vision of Victorian London in all its glory and seediness.  You can almost smell the stale water along the banks of the Thames and feel the chill of the air along Baker Street.  The remarkable set pieces and visual effects bring this period of London to life and it is as big a star as Downey Jr. or Law.

While purists may be turned off by the extensive action sequences and CGI, this is a film meant to thrill rather than intrigue.  Holmes still goes about solving mysteries but he's more a man of action than we've seen in previous depictions.  One note of concern is that a rather large sub-plot is left open, obviously hinting sequel.  The film certainly did well enough to warrant a follow-up but with Downey's involvement with the Iron Man and Avengers films, who knows when Holmes might be revisited.

Blu-Ray Extras

Maximum Movie Mode.  After you've watched the movie, watch it again in Maximum Movie Mode.  Instead of audio commentary, this is video commentary hosted by Director Guy Ritchie in which he takes viewers through the entire production, walking on to the film and utilizing split screens with Picture in Picture, still galleries, and storyboard comparisons.

Focus Points is a series of eight short featurettes:

Drawbridges and Doilies: Designing Late Victorian London (4:48) Production designer Sarah Greenwood shows how they went about creating a realistic looking 1891 London.

Not a Deerstalker Cap In Sight (4:15) A look at the Holmes character in the film and how the filmmakers tried to remain truer to Arthur Conan Doyle's original vision.

Ba-Ritsu (3:57) Looks at the martial arts skills of Holmes in the film.  Downey himself practices Wing Chun Kung-Fu

Elementary English: Perfecting Holmes' Accent (4:03) Dialect Coach Andrew Jack and Robert Downey Jr. discuss how his English accent was perfected.

Powers of Observation and Deduction (4:01) Looks at Holmes' legendary powers of deduction and how they were utilized in the film.

The Sherlockians (3:02)  This featurette provides a glimpse at Holmes fans and various fan groups including the famous Baker Street Irregulars, founded in 1934.

Future Past (4:00)  Looks at how actual locations in London were filmed and then transformed with visual effects to be reverted back to how it looked nearly 120 years ago.

Behind the Story:  Sherlock Holmes Reinvented (14:05)  This documentary features interviews with cast and crew covering how the film made Homes a 19th Century James Bond type of character but still embracing the source material.",1269907200,9,5102,4.976387249114522
2047205,1,B0001Z3TS4,"I went to go see this movie in theaters back in December and I loved it. As soon as I was done I bought the books, read them and went back to watch it a second time. The characters are great, Jude Law makes a perfect Watson, and while RDJ takes a while to get used to he certainly plays and interesting version of Holmes. It is definitely something I would recommend watching.

However, while I loved the movie, the DVD is a huge disappointment :/ It feels like they put no time and effort into it at all. No special features (I was really hoping for deleted scenes and/or bloopers) except for one 'how its made' segment. The start menu is also really unimpressive. It seems that they put all the extra stuff (including a different cover) on the blu-ray and left the DVD with nothing.

2047207,5,B0001Z3TS4,"First of all, as of this writing, Amazon still states that this item is a three disc set, but this is not the case. The DVD and digital copy are included on the same disc, while a second disc contains the Blu-Ray version. This isn't an issue, of course, just a small clarification. Speaking of which, I've seen a significant number of complaints regarding the inclusion of the DVD/digital copy in the Blu-Ray version, with many complaining that they want neither and it's needlessly driving the cost up.

A simple comparison of this item against other Blu-Rays on Amazon proves this title costs no more than any other new release, and the DVD/digital copy is actually a very nice bonus for those who buy the film early. I, for instance, plan to loan out the DVD to friends who don't own Blu-Ray players. The digital copy is nice, I suppose, but I've never been bored enough to want to watch a film on my iPod or laptop. Besides which, like all digital copies, it expires a year from now. I'm actually glad it's included on the same disc as the DVD, because all other digital copies included on a separate disc I've ended up tossing out.

Upon loading the Blu-Ray into the player three trailers will run. This is, of course, typical practice. The irritating part is that the disc will not allow the user to access the menu from the trailers, and the user is forced to manually fast-forward through each trailer. A minor complaint, to be sure, but irritating nonetheless. The film runs 02:08:24 and the Blu-Ray includes ten bonus features (the DVD doesn't contain a single special feature). The included audio tracks and subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish. The first eight features are all collected in the ""Focus Points"" section and consist of eight 3-5 minute featurettes exploring a specific facet of the film (there is a ""Play All"" function included). Most of the titles are rather self-explanatory, but here's a complete rundown of the featurettes:

1) ""Drawbridges & Doilies: Designing a Late Victorian London"" (5:00) - This feature highlights how the production designers suffused life into their vision of Victorian London with an acute attention to detail.

2) ""Not a Deerstalker Cap in Sight"" (4:15) - This feature explains how the filmmakers decided to take the Holmes character back to his roots in the original Arthur Conan Doyle tales and compare the Downey interpretation against past cinematic versions of Holmes.

3) ""Ba-ritsu: A Tutorial"" (3:58) - This feature explores how the filmmakers blended various real-life martial arts into the fictional version featured in the film, along with explaining how Holmes was a former fighter well-versed in martial arts in the original Doyle stories.

4) ""Elementary English: Perfecting Sherlock's Accent"" (4:04) - This feature explores how American Downey refined his English accent for the film. Director Guy Ritchie observes that he preferred an American because it gives the Holmes character an ""international"" flavor.

5) ""The One That Got Away"" (3:44) - This feature delves a bit into the psyche of Holmes, particularly his stance on love and his relationships with women.

6) ""Powers of Observation & Deduction"" (4:01) - This features Lionel Wigram (writer & producer of ""Sherlock Holmes"") explaining why he was attracted to the project, along with what makes Holmes such an enduringly fascinating character.

7) ""The Sherlockians"" (3:03) - The feature explores the diehard, borderline obsessive Holmes fans who organize annual meetings to discuss Doyle's life and works.

8) ""Future Past"" (3:08) - This feature highlights how, with the aid of both sets and modern technology, the filmmakers were able to recreate the glory and grime of Victorian London.

The ninth feature is included in the ""Behind the Movie"" section and is called ""Sherlock Holmes Reinvented"" (14:06) - This is a more involving feature which functions as an extension of the other featurettes. The filmmakers discuss why they felt attracted to the project and how they desired to stay true to the source material, as opposed to the cinematic versions of the past.

The most celebrated special feature here, prominently featured in the television ads, is the ""Maximum Movie Mode"". This is a sort of interactive film commentary with director Ritchie (running slightly longer than the film itself) that includes picture-in-picture still images, behind the scenes videos, cast and crew interviews, technical details of the film, and of course Ritchie's commentary. It's this sort of feature that truly makes a Blu-Ray special, aside from the enhanced high-definition image, of course. A typical film commentary simply has the director talking over the film, which can be informative but distracting. The ""Maximum Movie Mode"" is a much more entertaining commentary that even includes the option for user interactivity.

The content of the film itself is highly subjective, particularly with a character as famed and revered as Sherlock Holmes, and I don't feel particularly compelled to add my thoughts. As a Blu-Ray release, however, this title is every bit as impressive as it should be. I particularly appreciate how the special features didn't just shed light on the filmmaking process, but spent ample time discussing Doyle's stories, the various interpretations of the Holmes character, and the lasting legacy of it all.

2047208,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Both Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law bring an energy to the personas of Holmes and Watson that has been rarely seen. A mix of mystery, adventure, action, sci-fi and comedy, SHERLOCK HOLMES has a splash of everything and it works extremely well.

What Downey was able to do was exaggerate the known Holmes' skills (from deductive and inductive intelligence, through the arts of combat to his eccentric quirkiness), but avoid exaggerating them so much as to make them unbelievable.

The rapport between Holmes and Watson is much more human and equal than the superior/inferior, genius/buffoon that is often portrayed.

Those without imagination and particularly purists who only treasure the Conan Doyle canon and avoid pastiches of all kinds will not take to this film, but for anyone who enjoys lively adventure with a personable cast, SHERLOCK HOLMES is a must see.",1269907200,6,866,5.084507042253521

It was highly entertaining in and of itself, and did NOT need to have been called a Sherlock Holmes movie.
Perhaps they couldn't sell it on its own merits as a fun, adventure-packed Victorian romp.
So they attached it, albeit loosely and rather insultingly*, to Sherlock Holmes.

If they hadn't called these characters by Conan Doyle's character names....there wouldn't be all of these criticisms by Holmes-fans. It would have been viewed on its own merits instead of it becoming an evaluation of the accuracy of the pastiche.
If it had been set up as a fantasy-adventure-thriller-buddy-film.....
But THAT wouldn't have sold it, they needed a NAME to carry it into the market.

So.
We have this FUN ROMP of a movie, some great humour moments, great EFX, and a very entertaining Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law set of interactions.

Downey imbues Holmes with the intellectual charisma we've all come to know, with the raw physicality that is only hinted at in the stories.  Law's Watson is a feisty man himself, smart and witty and not afraid to shoulder his share of the burden (we often forget that Watson was a veteran and rather intellectual himself).  The two bounce off each other marvelously; their one-liners are so sharp, it's hard not to suspect a bit of improvisation on their part.

Why?  Because the rest of the script sags so horribly, the film itself doesn't keep up under repeated viewings.  The plot revolves around Holmes and Watson investigating the death--and subsequent resurrection--of Lord Blackwood, a serial killer who claims to have the powers of the dark side.  As Blackwood, Mark Strong is sneering and menacing; unfortunately, he's given little else to do.  Strong himself is a supremely talented actor, but he's got absolutely nothing to work with.  The same goes for Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler (very little comparison to the original Adler), who serves as Holmes's female foible and nothing more.  Some will view her as a strong female protagonist; rightfully, we should see her as filler, which is a shame, because McAdams deserves much better.

Still, when it comes to delightfully mindless action, you could do worse that Guy Ritchie's take on the Sherlock Holmes mythology.  And the film definitely sets itself up for a sequel, which I'll be seeing (assuming Downey and Law are on board).  This is the start of a franchise that probably won't get any better, but could definitely be a whole lot worse.  For traditionalists and purists, stick with Basil Rathbone; this film will just frustrate you.  For all others, hopefully this will encourage to seek out older film versions; and hopefully, if there's any hope for humanity (and I tend to be pessimistic on that point), then you'll even go out and read the stories.",1269648000,,2238,4.930666666666666
2047213,3,B0001Z3TS4,"This incarnation of SHERLOCK HOLMES should be an excellent movie.  I enjoy all the actors, and most of the acting is very good.  They characters they portray are engaging and have nice chemistry.  The plot is decent, if a little worn.  The costumes are lovely and the recreation of 19th century London is outstanding.  Even the score is very nice.  Taken individually each of these elements appears to succeed.  So why is SHERLOCK HOLMES so much less than the sum of its parts?

In my opinion, the cinematography, the writing, and the direction bring SHERLOCK HOLMES down.  The cinematography is dark and dim; the sun never shines.  At times, it is hard to see what is going on.  The perpetual storm over London stops any of the lovely costumes from popping.  Basically, SHERLOCK HOLMES is boring to look at.  The writing doesn't help either.  While the plot is entertaining, it is similar to many recent plots, including Dan Brown's current novel or one of The Librarian movies.  Not really worthy of SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Lastly, the direction really fails SHERLOCK HOLMES.  The film lacks suspense where it should be brimming with it.  It is a very one dimensional film, devoid of depth and substance, completely superficial.  The audience is never enveloped by the story.  And for some reason, the director allows Robert Downey, Jr. to mumble throughout.  RDJ is a better actor than that.

I really wanted to like SHERLOCK HOLMES, but the misdirection and lack of execution left me with a very lukewarm impression overall.  It was very nice to see this SHERLOCK HOLMES hearken back to its roots in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and not the old Basil Rathbone films), but it just wasn't enough to get me excited.  And I wanted to be excited.  I hear that a second film is in the works.  I will probably see it, but with a little trepidation.  Let's hope that they can make the necessary improvements to make the next SHERLOCK HOLMES the outstanding movie that it should be.",1269648000,2,1979,4.7272727272727275
2047214,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes is a name everyone knows, but forget what you think you know about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary figure. Guy Ritchie's Holmes isn't the buttoned-down and mild-mannered sleuth he is so often portrayed as in films, TV shows, and movies. He's still the brilliant detective with unmatched powers of perception and deductive reasoning, but here, his mental abilities are matched with equally formidable butt-whooping skills.

A master pugilist skilled in unarmed and melee combat, he isn't the sort to wait around for the cops to show up -- he takes matters into his own hands, quite literally, with knuckle and baton. In the first 5 minutes of the film, we see him infiltrate a crime in progress and listen in on the inner monologue in his head as he talks through his plan of attack. With methodical and scientific precision, we then see him carry out the numbered steps with the ruthless, calm efficiency of a master combatant. This sequence is really fun to watch in the way it is filmed and executed and it happens twice in the film. At his best, Holmes is an unorthodox and cunning crime-solver with a penchant for doing things his way and little deference to procedure. At his worst, he is an erratic recluse, an insensitive lout, and just a plain ole slob, living out of Watson's home and performing chemistry experiments on his bulldog.

But before you complain that this is untrue to Doyle's vision, consider what he actually wrote: ""Although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind... [he] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece... He had a horror of destroying documents... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner."" Doyle's Holmes was a deeply flawed character with many personal demons (substance abuse being one of them), and this is one that Ritchie returns to for this darker, grittier film.

Robert Downey Jr, whose own life involved a lot of personal struggles, is brilliant as Holmes and I can't think of a person better suited for the role. Jude Law is Dr Watson, former soldier, Holmes' partner and best friend, so this is sort of a buddy movie, along with all the interpersonal dramas and conflicts of that genre. Together, they match wits (and fists) with Lord Blackwood, master of the occult and the main villian in this film, and his cultists. Set in a gray and dreary Victorian London, the set designs are beautifully done and a joy to behold. If you like period films, you'll love the art direction in this movie. We do see some overly CG-heavy shots like the unfinished London Bridge and one fight scene in the drydocks that is a bit over the top with CG silliness, feeling too much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League-of-Extraordinary-Gentlemen/dp/B000ICLRHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>.

Overall, the film is very entertaining and worth the time to watch if you enjoy action-mystery movies and are a fan of the two leading men. The many fight scenes in this film keep things moving and there are some comic elements thrown in, as well as a recurring gag with the dog. Everything wraps up neatly at the end with all the mysteries solved and the methods explained by Holmes, though at least one of the methods is very predictable and has been done to death in mystery films. The ending leave the possibility of a sequel wide open, which I am looking forward to seeing in the future.",1269388800,10,3782,4.932496075353218

I am not into Sherlock Holmes at all but I found Robert Downey Jr's performance to be highly entertaining and should have been an easy Oscar nomination but that didn't happen so maybe next time. Jude Law was fantastic as Dr. John Watson, a doctor who is going to get married to Mary but Holmes has this unusual dependence upon him. It's a platonic relationship and the movie doesn't dwell on that too much. It has a great supporting cast like James Fox OBE and Geraldine James OBE and Rachel McAdams as the love interest. There are some funny moments especially when naked Holmes is cuffed and bound and caught in bed by a startled maid. There is also adventure and it's a fun film. I think Guy Ritchie deserves credit in directing this film. Downey and Law were on their marks and Holmes and Watson.

The only part was the script's weakness and the plot. Anyway, I'm sure that you'll find it entertaining. The costumes and art direction are first rate. Unfortunately, Downey nor Law didn't get nominated for that Oscar. Maybe they should have Sherlock Holmes investigate the matter.",1269216000,4,1149,4.632352941176471

I loved this movie.  I watch a lot of English movies and I really enjoyed this, I thought that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law did a excellent job.  I am a very young grand mother , but only go to the movies that peak my interest and this movie was one of them.  I liked the point that Sherlock Holmes used his brain a lot in the movie and that Dr. Watson was a faithful side kick, and as for using his gun he did shot it twice in the movie, for that person who fell asleep in the movies 5 times; and don't remember if Watson shot the gun or not.  I also loved the theme music and feel that Guy Richie did a good job as a director. I would not say that is one of the the best movies that I have ever watched but it was a good movie and I would recommend it to others.

2047220,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Whether or not this accurately portrays the Sherlock Holmes from the famous stories is unimportant, at least for me. I wanted to see a good, entertaining film, and that is exactly what I experienced. It is by no means a classic masterpiece, but it was certainly a fun ride. The plot is a tad on the choppy side, but it doesn't deter from whole experience.

The film works beautifully first and foremost because of the wonderful chemistry between Holmes and Watson. It felt pure and believable and watching them argue and bicker for almost the entire film was refreshing and amusing. Jude Law's Watson is the voice of reason and under all the sarcasm and berating, truly cares for his long-time friend. In my opinion, a perfectly cast role. Though I also loved Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, I felt that he muttered alot in the film and was at times hard to understand. But his physical presence saved the role and you can tell he put 100% into this part.

The scenery was gloomy and strangely beautiful, as were the period details, costumes, etc. Guy Ritchie did a fantastic job in reimagining the era and creating a sense of mystery tinged with a clever, comedic flair.

Sherlock Holmes contains enough action, mystery and comedy to keep just about anybody from being bored and would do well with multiple viewings.",1268784000,8,1313,4.7
2047221,4,B0001Z3TS4,Everything that this prior reviewer has said about Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is spot on. This is what Sherlock Holmes was supposed to be if ever adapted into a feature film. Robert Downey Jr. either really did a critical read of the stories or he had somebody explain them to him very carefully and patiently because his acting is very similar to what you read on paper. He even had many of the mannerisms and meter down pact. This was a solid vision that Guy Richie had and he executed it well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was all the CGI which looked awesome but maybe the movie didn't need so much. Just my opinion. However those that were expecting a watered down Holmes should really read the stories and do some critical analysis and you will be surprised how wrong you are.,1268784000,6,809,4.436241610738255

WHY???  This is what I do not understand.  You can't get an edgier or more exciting, unpredictable character than the REAL Holmes.

Please.  If you want to watch rather than read Holmes, take the time to watch Jeremy Brett in the role.  He was phenomenal; the kind of actor who overtakes the character in your mind and becomes him completely.

This movie apparently shares nothing at all with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle other than the character names.  Really, really.  Don't bother with it.  Go watch Bond if you want Bond.",1268438400,13,660,4.603448275862069
2047225,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I`ve read the source material, and the Holmes depicted in this film measures up very well.

What is throwing some people is that whereas Doyle served up Holmes` personal particulars in small sporadic doses; this film delivers them all in one shot, and it is a bit overwhelming.

Nonetheless, all the elements of the character seen here are evident in the original stories.

 Give credit where it is due; this Holmes is ALWAYS THINKING, and that is the hallmark of the character. Even when he is fighting, it is an intellectual exercise to him.

Just as in the Granada Television series; the Watson herein is the competant, intelligent and reliable friend that he should be...(Gone forever I hope, is the bumbling idiot that Watson became in the Rathbone/Bruce movies)

While there is no Jeremy Brett here, Robert Downey Jr. clearly put solid effort into his Sherlock, and while his depiction is a more gritty, 'warts and all' Holmes, I actually found the foibles and failures to be refreshing. Again, Doyles` Holmes was not perfect as anything other than a detective, so it`s all within the scope of the character. There is a risque` scene that has Holmes gulled and placed in a particularly foolish and vulnerable position, and that no doubt puts off the Holmes Purists as an insult to the character. I won`t argue that it is pandering to the prurient-minded... but I also say that it hardly ruins the rest of the film.

Finally; Doyle did not create Sherlock Holmes as an intellectual exercise, he created him as entertainment, and this film is entertaining.

I`ll be just fine with adding this Sherlock to my Holmes collection.",1268352000,2,1630,4.838129496402877

Robert Downey Jr. is great as a younger, more pugalistic version of Holmes than people are used to seeing (the curse of Basil Rathbone). Jude Law is also a very good Dr. Watson, less bumbling than the usual Watson, which I also liked. I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did, but the action, acting, atmosphere, story line and the cinematography won me over.

The plot revolves around Holmes trying to thwart the nefarious plans of a man thought to be a ghost. I liked the Illuminati references in the movie, depicting how the upper-crust of British society was into occult practices, which is not a fantasy. There are alot of well designed action scenes in this film that did not over-power the film.

The actors did the best they could with the muddle of a script and the bad directing from Guy--if the story gets boring, throw in a fight and some property damage--Ritchie (whose films I used to enjoy). And the dialogue was unintelligible at several points in the film. If I can understand Monty Python, I can understand any British accent.

It was one of those movies with a little of everything - Mystery, Action, Drama, and some really great Humor!  From the trailer, I was under the impression that this movie would take place at the beginning of Holmes and Watson's partnership, when in fact it was all about them going their seperate ways (which I think worked extremely well and allowed us to see a more fragile side of the brilliant and formidable Holmes).

In my opinion, the casting was spot on.  Law and Downey's characters had a great love/hate relationship allowing for some really funny moments, but also revealing their deep respect for each other.  I also really liked Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade.

STARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Eddie Marsan, Robert Maillet and Kelly Reilly

WRITTEN BY: Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg and Lionel Wigram; based on the characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle

DIRECTED BY: Guy Ritchie

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Action / Mystery
Release Date: 25 December 2009

Robert Downey Jr. is back! Thanks to his blessing as Tony Stark in Iron Man, he's catapulted himself to A-list status. He's recently blown us away with his Oscar nominated performance in Tropic Thunder, and his highly underrated portrayal in The Soloist. Now, he returns to take our breath away yet again, as the amazing Sherlock Holmes.

I'm not gonna lie; I am not familiar with the character of Sherlock Holmes at all, despite him having been depicted probably more than any character we know of. That includes favorites such as James Bond and Ebenezer Scrooge. According to [...], Holmes has appeared in well over 200 television and cinematic projects; the first of which dates all the way back to 1905. That's impressive. I have no idea if this movie lives up to what fans of the character and the novels would expect. But I enjoyed the film a great deal. I simply saw it due to the actors involved in the project. Ok, I'm a bit of a Guy Ritchie fan as well - but who isn't?

The film is undoubtedly an obnoxious action flick that may annoy many. It has a bit of humor, and a great deal of mystery to it as well, but it's the action-junkies that will get the most from it. Unfortunately, I suspect that is also what will ruin it for some; particularly those expecting it to be more of a subtle mystery.

I'm just a sucker for good action movies and so long as the actors are magnificent, I'm willing to look past a somewhat weak story. Sherlock Holmes was exactly that for me. It moves very fast and at times you may be off track by what is going on. What's great however is Holmes will often catch you back up to pace with things you might have missed, using well-narrated flashbacks and comedic one-liners.

The plot could have been better, but then again it certainly could have been worse. We meet a nasty villain early on in the film by the name of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). He's a tyrant who practices in the dark arts. Holmes and his faithful sidekick Watson (Jude Law) take him down in the first few minutes, and he is put to death by hanging. Due to his dark trade, he magically comes back to life to wreak havoc on the people of London once again. Somewhat bitter by his un-expected return from the grave, Holmes and Watson are eager to take the case and catch him a second time.

Downey and Law are brilliant together and you get the feeling they have known each other for years. They go together like peanut butter and jelly or Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller.

Law plays Watson very well and is everything you would want a sidekick to be. And Downey was definitely snubbed out of an Oscar nomination for his performance as Holmes. His accent is perfected to a T and his Sherlock persona is more than impressive and highly entertaining. At least he took home the Golden Globe.

I was disappointed to see some of the scenes with Rachel McAdams that we saw in the trailer, sadly removed from the theatrical version of the film. Maybe they will show up on the DVD and BLU-RAY discs. She was wonderful as always, as Holmes' love interest, Irene.

The look and feel of the film reminded me a great deal of the phenomenal horror / thriller From Hell. Director Guy Ritchie has given Holmes a playground amidst the streets of an eerie London that looks like it could easily be housing Jack the Ripper. It's not too dark though; the brilliant Academy Award nominated score makes the setting less sinister.

Ritchie did a terrific job directing this film. His cinematography is very detailed and every shot looks like a million bucks. The `guy' (no pun intended) has an eccentric vision. The fight sequences are awesome and are among the best I've seen since Fight Club or the Jason Bourne movies. He uses some computer graphics, but only where he needed to and they look amazing. He's not afraid to use them in wide shots, that fill nearly the entire frame and that takes guts.

If it's not too much to ask, I have only one request for the currently untitled sequel that is to be released sometime in 2011 (with Brad Pitt rumored to be co-starring). I'd like very much to see Watson at some point in the film say to Holmes, ""Well no s*** Sherlock."" Would that be too much? I think it would be swell.",1267228800,2,4577,4.5175332527206775

  o Of course, follows the traditional American movie making style (explains everything) as opposed to the British ones (more cerebral)
  * Not your fathers ""arm-chair"" detective !
  * Lots of action - I think Guy Ritchie has chosen a balance between smartness and action - enough to begin a new franchise !
  o Of course, the story is all new
  o May be he should redo all the SH books!
  o And I shudder to think what Guy will do with Poirot !
  * Didn't hear the words ""Elementary, Dear Watson"" !
  * In fact, the major change is Dr. Watson, a totally different personality - for starters, old Dr. Watson is a gentleman - he would never sock Holmes !
  * I think Robert Downey Jr. captured Holmes' eccentricity very well - not the edgy and melancholic portrayal by Jeremy Brett
  o He has the crispiness that we saw in Jeremy Brett as well
  * He is very action-oriented - may be he will develop more of a pensive personality in the future films
  o Granted - even Conan Doyle pictures Sherlock as athletic, not a couch potatoe ;o)
  * The sound track is excellent - should be - it is by Hans Zimmer !
  o I have the Dark Knight Audio CD[http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Knight-Hans-Zimmer/dp/B0017I1FP8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1263880244&sr=8-1]

  o Even while watching the movie, I occasionally noticed the sound tracks - it stands out in many places
  o Am ordering the DVD, just for the music ...
  * Am going to take the little Kaushik sometime soon (He has read all the Sherlock Holmes books - should be interesting to hear his comparison )

* Trivia : Jeremy Brett was born Peter Jeremy William Huggins. Becuase of his career choice, his father forbade him to use the family name. So Jeremy chose the name of the manufacturer of the suit he was wearing - Brett & Co !

Anyone reading this who has any interest in filmed versions of the Sherlock Holmes stories should immediately watch/rent/borrow/buy the Granada television series from the 80's.  They are simply superb.  Anyway, I was shocked at how much this movie did not suck.  Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job.  Jude Law does too.  It was fun and funny.  It's mostly an action movie.  I would guess the aim of the movie was to present Sherlock Holmes to audiences used to things like Batman or any of the latest crop of comic book action hero movies of the last few years.  Could it have benefited from some more breathing room for engaging dialogue with deductive reasoning and dramatic tension?  Sure.  Do the kids want that?  Heck no!  Are there a lot of explosions?  Yes.  Are there too many?  Maybe. Does the movie have anything to do with the original stories?  Yes, the movie never does anything that you couldn't imagine Sherlock or Watson doing.  It's just sort of hyped up.  There are fight scenes.  Sherlock could fight.  It's in the original stories.  Sherlock does deserve a movie that matches his contemplative mood.  A movie for boring old farts like me.  Does anyone make those kinds of movies anymore?  This movie is more akin to Moulin Rouge than it is The Good the Bad and the Ugly.  It's in your face and the kids won't fall asleep due to explosions.  There's nothing in it that will make you cringe.  The story isn't amazing but it's passable.",1266710400,6,1512,4.64638783269962

I knew it was going to be a modernized version of the Sherlock Holmes legacy, but the only thing this movie had in common with the original story were a few names and the deductive reasoning of Holmes. Everything else about it felt wrong and out of place, especially the fight scenes. The original Holmes was highly intelligent, but he never used this talent to be some kind of MMA fighter. The vibe of this movie was also far too slapstick for my liking and it was really hard to understand what the characters were saying because of the English accents. I usually don't have a problem with this kind of thing, but this movie needed subtitles. The story itself was terrible and I nearly walked out, but it was one of those things where I figured I sat here this long and might as well stay to the ending. That was a mistake because the ending sucked too. I can't believe these guys think they are going to make another movie.

2047238,3,B0001Z3TS4,"When I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was going to star in a Sherlock Holmes film, I eagerly awaited its opening. I couldn't get into the cineplex when it first arrived in my town and by the time I got around to seeing it, it was playing in another venue that caters to low class adventure films.  Well it only cost me $3.50 to get in...and that's about the best thing I can say about it.

At first I had happy fantasies about Downey and Jude Law teaming up, a la Newman and Redford, for some wonderful buddy films.  Downey and Law are among the more talented and good looking actors working today, just as Newman and Redford were in their day.

Well it that were ever to happen, they would certainly need a better director and a better script.  The idea is fascinating--a remake of Holmes and Watson, emphasizing a different side of the hero than the traditional one.  However the script is stupid to the point of idiotic.  There is no dramatic tension---just one hair-raising crisis after another---accompanied by hideously loud music.  Since we know that Holmes and his buddy are going to prevail, there is no point in getting tense as we witness them getting almost blown up or squished or whatever---I ceased caring after a while.

Downey, who is a terrific actor, is terribly wasted here.  Perhaps he was embarrased because he mumbled so many of his lines that I was wishing for subtitles.  'Interesting that he is nomintated for an Oscar for the performance--I think he's wonderful, but this role is so one-dimensional, that, again I ceased to care.

Jude Law, as the conservative side-kick, actually comes across as the more interesting character, since he has at least some variety of emotions.  Downey/Holmes is so arrogant/cool that, again, I lost interest.  In this supposedly frantically exciting film, I found myself yawning repeatedly and I really wanted to leave.  I did stay, to get my $3.50 worth and to see if the ending would have redeem the film in any way.  It didn't.",1266019200,8,1988,4.685878962536023
2047239,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Being a Sherlock Holmes fan for nearly two decades now, I've read every one of Doyle's stories and have seen a ton of different versions of Holmes and Watson.  Basil Rathbone was far too stiff, Nigel Bruce far too idiotic.  A few other actors were entertaining but didn't quite meet up to task (though Peter Cushing took hold of my heart for writing on his cuff - So very Holmes, that!).  Jeremy Brett has always been my all time favorite portrayer of the role... until now.

Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson are flawless, especially when you consider that all the Holmes stories except for two are written from Watson's point of view.  (Seriously, people, if you were writing about your best friend, would you tell them EVERYTHING about them?  Or would you couch your words to be as gentle, if honest, as possible?)  The Holmes in this film is the Holmes in the stories: a drug addict, a recluse until something catches his attention, suspicious of women (his behavior towards both Irene Adler and Mary Morstan reflects this), an expert fighter, deliberately ""forgetful"" when it's to his advantage, manipulative, impulsive, and extremely irritating but, at the same time, devoutly loyal to his friends, even if he may taunt them mercilessly.  Equally, we see the Watson as he was written in the stories: organized, caring, intelligent (something often neglected in other films), patient (with Holmes, you really have to be) but only to a point, and most importantly loyal.  The line in the movie that best describes Holmes and Watson is ""Brother not in blood but in bond"" and that is what you get with this movie.

  The movie isn't exactly everything I hoped for from a Sherlock Holmes movie. He doesn't only use his brain to solve the case but brawn and bullets as well. Which isn't anything like the original stories. From the trailers I really expected to loath this movie and the approach that was taken with it. However, Guy Ritchie didn't really hack up the story as much as I expected. The trailer that showed non-stop action and Holmes doing Pit Fighting made me think otherwise.

2047241,4,B0001Z3TS4,"The new Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the great detective, and Jude Law as his sidekick, Dr. Watson, is enjoyable, but hardly the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The fact that there were five (count them - five!) writers on this film may explain part of the problem. Then there's director Guy Richie, who's typical film is the likes of RocknRolla. Rather than Sir Arthur's stories, which are very much grounded in pre-Edwardian thinking and culture, what we're given is a cross between Sherlock Holmes and The Wild, Wild West. And instead of the cerebral, hunter-clad mystery-solver, we're offered a slovenly rake that engages in fisticuffs as often as James West. I wonder at what the filmmakers were thinking.

While Downey is interesting, certainly, he is no Holmes. (Or, perhaps I should say, no Basil Rathbone.) Law as Dr. Watson, on the other hand, is quite convincing and the greatest asset to the film. He would almost have made a better Homes. I think this is an example of miscast actors, as well as miscast vision. Other disappointments include the plot, which is completely far-fetched and dark, as the antagonists involve themselves in world domination through Satanism (!!!). And the flashback technique used to make sure we notice all the clues Holmes uncovers is clever once, but becomes redundant with overuse. The weakest part of the film is the ending: a fight between Holmes and Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, on a broken down bridge that is so obviously CGI that the whole scene seems fake - not good for a climax.

Some of the better aspects of the film are that it is fun, and highly entertaining. I mean, how can a film about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson not be entertaining if it's done halfway right? There's just something about a detective sleuthing around the fog-laden streets of London. And Robert Downey, Jr. does bring a lot to the table - it's just not a lot of Sherlock Holmes. Then there's the attractive third protagonist, Rachel McAdams, who adds to the Wild, Wild West feel. In spite of its weaknesses, Sherlock Holmes is enjoyable; but the series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce is still the best. PG-13

Still, it was a fun movie and Jude Law and Robery Downey Jr. have a chemistry together that I have not seen matched in a very long time!

2047243,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes has been so standardized that this new film is absolutely thrilling and fascinating. Of course we can look at it as a ""touristic"" guide to 19th century London, with mud, crime, squalor, bleakness, and it is true little of the top class or upper society. This London has been shown very often from Oliver Twist to Dracula or Elephant Man. But that is definitely not the main interest of this film. Then there is the fight against crime. There are two types of criminals. Lord Blackwood who is trying with a secret society that believes in human sacrifice to frighten the populace to establish the fascist rule of the upper class who wants to reestablish a total and absolute centralized power that has  never existed in England anyway. And then there is the scientific crime that tries to transform crime into a fine art, the eighth fine art of this world but whose objective is only stealing and getting all the most beautiful stones, gems and the biggest piles of money they can, but with the beauty of a wizard. Lord Blackwood is another Voldemort and in a way Irene Adler and her boss are criminalized Harry and Hermione Potter. But that is of little interest except that it creates a phenomenal action. What is most important here is the relation between Dr Watson and Sherlock Holmes, a full and absolute homo-friendship. They cannot live without each other. They cannot even survive without each other. They realize that homo-friendship in their action against crime. But the film is extremely clear and careful to show that this is only a friendship between two souls and that the only male element in that friendship in the male action, and by male I mean violent and disruptive, physical and muscular. And the film shows how these two men are obsessed each one by a particular woman. Dr Watson will be able to satisfy his sexual hunger by marrying his Mary, but she will have to become the go-between of the two men. She will have to bring her husband, soul and mind tied up, at the feet of Sherlock Holmes for one more batch or episode of adventure every so often. Dr Watson can love Mary only if he can love Sherlock Holmes and take part in his capers and adventures. On the other hand Sherlock Holmes can only survive in this life if he is chasing his own love in the person of Irene Adler and sexual contact can only be submissive on Sherlock Holmes' side. Irene will take advantage of him sexually when he has been reduced to passivity by some kind of soporific drug and Sherlock Holmes loves it and he will go on running after her and he will only get the satisfaction of holding her tight to prevent her from being cut in two lengthwise by a belt saw. That's only utilitarian physical contact whose sexual dimension has been evacuated by the danger. And the key to his liberation is under the cushion for sure but he is handcuffed to the bed and as nude as a new born baby with all his hairs standing up on their roots when the chamber maid arrives. This homo-friendship is exactly what Walt Whitman described so well in his poetry, particularly in his Calamus songs. The attraction between two men that makes them partners in life for some active and material objective with no sexual dimension and with two women around them who are making them dream of sex and run after their skirts but who have to bring them together regularly for their sexual energy to be reloaded by some adventure against some criminal, like Moriarty. Beautiful modern film that is talking to us of the emotional relations between people, man and man, woman and woman, man and woman, woman and man, in a very harsh world slowly edging towards fascism but always avoiding this deadly end. The most extreme advocate of eugenics and social Darwinism was H.G. Wells at the end of the 20th century: the only non Caucasian whites who were tolerated were the Jews provided their intermarried, and all alcoholics, mentally and physically handicapped people had to be gotten rid of. Hitler was only different from that objective as fort his position about the Jews. That's the society that is reflected in this film but from an iconoclastic point of view that is praising emotional relations between beings as founded on nothing rational, just love. And don't forget you can and must love your worst enemy.

I never read the books, never seen the British TV shows, but everyone is familiar with Sherlock Holmes, a literary character who has made it's way into American pop culuture. Such phrases as ""You don't have to be Sherlock to figure that one out"" witty sayings like that, you get my point.

Anyways I am a Guy Ritchie fan, Robery Downely Jr also, so after Iron man and Tropic Thunder, Downey Jr is a hot commodity I see. But Downey Jr as Holmes and Jude Law as his side kick? I honestly thought the roles should have been reversed at first, I thought Downey would make for a better Watson really. After watching this film which does have Ritchie influence, slo mo shots, fast shots, quick edits, plus I think this is Ritchie's first big big budget movie backed by a big Studio.

What a nice start off point for a potential franchise, the story itself is good, felt I've seen this type of story before, An evil occultist dies for the murder of 4 women I couldn't but think  was this a hint that Sherlock and Watson foiled Jack the Ripper and the killer all along was a man who believed in the occult? it is never implied that was the case... then again I could be totally wrong and the antagonist played by Mark Strong was just a bad guy who wants world domination. Anyways Lord Blackwood as his name is promises to to come back after his death... and so he does, this is where the game is afoot.

Now Sherlock has to deal with this, deal with Watson getting married and soon leaving their shared Flat/ office. But as much as Watson gets ready to be done with Holmes he is pulled back in helping his friend, partner much to his chagrin. The interaction between RDJR and JL is what makes the movie work, their chemistry, their bickering, and banter between one another as they try to figure out how Lord Blackwood rose from his grave is great. As one can tell between their squabbles there is an underlying affection for one another, a said brother bond between them

So through out the movie they are trying to solve said mystery. RDJR plays Sherlock very well, as an eccentric, smart, witty, charming, brash, manic depressive, detective using his skills to deduce the unplausible to plausible explainations, and he likes to go to under ground boxing matches using his wits on how to take down an opponent then using that physically, nicely played out to the tradiontal song of Rocky Road to Dublin, (this is where Ritchie's camera style comes in, slow mo shots and quick edits, it's reminscent of Snatch when Pitt is in the ring) Then Sherlock uses his winnings and gives to Watson who likes to gamble. Jude Law plays Watson as the voice of reason, this is how that interaction works between them, why I think the movie worked just because of RDJR and JL on screen chemistry. Even though Holmes insults Watson's future wife, experiments on his dog, takes his clothes, rarely bathes, speaks his mind openly, not realzing sometimes the consquences, sticks his nose up at Scotland yard and their Detectives, but somehow Scotland yard needs Holmes and his brilliant mind, where one scene a Detective punches Holmes, and says ""I've always wanted to do that"" shows how Holmes can get under people's skin, funny, scene indeed, but throughout all of this Watson sticks with him.

My only problem we see Holmes and Watson try to figure out what Lord Blackwood is up too (wants to blow up Parliment and throw London into Chaos and have a new world order wow what a shocker, haven't seen that in a movie.. V for Vendetta, as I said plot/story wise a nice jump start to a Franchise where as always in a potential franchise the sequel ups the anty which I think we will see)
Not to spoil everything, Holmes deduces everything using his brains, my only quip some of the scientific stuff protrayed in the film, I don't know if it was around in the late 19th Century then again it's a movie.

Oh yes and rachel mcadams plays holmes old flame who has something up her sleeve as well working for professor Moriarty who I do know is a character from the books and is Holmes nemisis.

So, in essence it's a buddy cop movie set in Victorian London, worth checking out for the banter between the two main actors, you can tell Downey Jr and Law had fun, it shows through their performances.

other notable buddy movies worth checking out: 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour 2, Bullet Proof, Red Heat, Tango and Cash, and Bady Boys I and II",1265328000,3,4459,4.514250309789343
2047245,3,B0001Z3TS4,"I am not a Sherlock Holmes scholar.

I KNOW of him, in the sense that I know that he's the fictional father of forensic science, was often portrayed with a deerstalker hat, pipe, and cape, and had a well meaning if bumbling sidekick known as Watson.  He was also very British, a fact that looms large in this new interpretation of Holmes.

Holmes skill, and by proxy his creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, orbited around the fundamentals of British society, something I think we Americans don't always appreciate.  The notion that you can tell something about a man by the way he dresses, by the stains on his shirt, by the way he walks, by the inclination of his head or how he swings his arms, all feed into the insidious belief that one does not rise above one's class.  This is part of Holmes' brilliance in penetrating disguises and deceptions - the bad guys can pretend to be someone else, but their true nature gives them away.

Viewed through this lens, this latest incarnation of Sherlock Holmes (played with beleaguered smugness by Robert Downey Jr.) gives us glimpses of the society that helped shape him.  We understand that Holmes can spot a tobacco stain, chalk dust, or a shoe scuff - but not the reasons that such details are intuitively obvious to a man of Holmes' intellect and perception.  He's paying attention to things that the society of his time took for granted.

The plot revolves around Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a cultist capable of manipulating a secret society into believing that he can survive even the hangman's noose. The name is reminiscent of Algernon Blackwood, the author of the horror classic, The Wendigo, and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn manifests in the film as ""The Temple of the Four Orders."" Blackwood's sinister influence is perhaps more appropriately attributed to Aleister Crowley.  The secret society is significant, because it blurs the social boundaries, with members from across high society (even Americans!). This is simply intolerable, and we look to Holmes to set the social order straight once more.

Guy Ritchie is no fool - he knew that to make Holmes palatable to Americans the Holmes myth would need to be punched up (literally).  So all the vices, all the physical prowess, and all the eccentricities of Holmes are in full display here - his lack of tidiness, his familiarity with the marital art bartitsu, and his obsession with Irene Adler. There is evidence that all these elements existed in the Holmes canon.  They were of course revealed gradually, whereas the film throws them all into the pot at once.  Whether or not this is a good thing depends on your appreciation for pulp.

The pulp film style - non-stop action interspersed with little explanation - is in full force.  Victorian England isn't explained; it's simply on display in all its gritty glory. The extras are really ugly, brutish caricatures while the leads are almost luminescent in their cleanliness and pearly-white teeth. Adler being the prime example (played by the delicious Rachel McAdams).

McAdams seems woefully out of her depth.  While her character is supposedly so wily as to be the only woman to give Holmes a run for his money, it's established very early that Holmes has the upper hand.  In fact, their relationship comes off as something of a schoolboy crush - understandable, but not quite a worthy foil for Holmes.

Downey is his usually disheveled, recovering-addict self.  It's clear Downey's become the new go-to man for playing characters that closely parallel his own real-life troubles, and the actor inhabits them ably.  Maybe a little too much so - the infernal ""Downey mumble"" is in full effect here--sometimes I can't make out a single word of what he was saying.

The real standout is Jude Law as Watson.  Law's refined yet frustrated Watson grounds Holmes, as he should.  He also upstages Downey with his easy British eloquence. This version of Watson is no fool but a worthy equal, establishing a buddy-cop vibe to the film.

Ritchie's cinematography is practically a character unto itself.  Whether he's showing Holmes' calculating his attacks in slow motion or zooming through carriage and across cobblestones, he manages to encompass all of Victorian England with a sweep of the camera.  It's a testament to Ritchie's skill that the film doesn't drag despite its long running time.

Loud, violent, fast-paced, and a little too blas in its forensic explanations, Sherlock Holmes is nevertheless entertaining enough to make it worth seeing for fans who know of Holmes by reputation only.  .",1265068800,2,4596,4.908150064683053
2047246,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Most people's expectations of Sherlock Holmes is ""supposed to be"" are shaped by what they saw in movies and a few tv episodes, maybe reading a few of the original stories. This classic view is often wrong. This movie brings back Holmes to what he was in the books, and while it may focus a little more on the action, some parts of Holmes' characteristics from the original books are toned down (the original Holmes had a penchant for drug abuse).

In any case, the movie taken by itself is spectacular. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal and Jude Law, whom i'm not usually fond of, is solid as Watson. The overall story is fast-paced but never lets you down, and I disagree with the editorial above that the plot is a mess. The plot is very smart, letting you guess at what's coming without actually telling you but never leaving you behind. For those worried about the action: while it is there, Holmes rarely relies on action as his sole weapon. His mind is the most effective tool in this movie; his fists are just a way of executing his plans.

Also of note is Hans Zimmer's music: providing an eclectic and original score that I believe is his best work (yes, better than the Dark Knight).

2047247,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Ok. For all those who are saying. ""If you are looking for a faithful version, adaptation, etc look elsewhere..."" I ask you: Have you actually read Sherlock Holmes or are you basing that statement on your image of Sherlock Holmes as has been portrayed in the past?
  Where in all of the stories does it state that Holmes wears a deerstalker hat and walks around with a Calabash pipe? Sidney Paget, who illustrated the stories for The Strand magazine, interpreted the descriptions in the stories. That was his version of what Holmes might look like.
  This new version is Guy Ritchie's interpretation and it is quite refreshing. In the stories, Holmes is a boxer, bare knuckle fighter, marksman, swordsman and an accomplished martial artist in addition to being brilliant at deduction and a master of disguise. There was only one woman whom Holmes was impressed by in his life -most of these qualities are portrayed in the new film so how is this ""not faithful""? If anything, it is one of the most faithful movies to deal with Holmes that I have ever seen.
  I will admit that for ""classic"" Holmes there is no better than Jeremy Brett in my humble opinion. His performance will never be matched. However, that is an entirely different interpretation of the character. I approached this new film with an open mind and was very pleasantly  surprised.
  Robert Downey Jr. is, in my opinion, a perfect fit for this role. His ability to reflect the intelligence, physical prowess and sardonic wit of Holmes was dead on. Jude law was exceptional as Dr. Watson. Not some bumbling, moronic sidekick of the past but a true companion possessing formidable skills of his own. Just as in the stories.
  Downey and Law's performance was a pleasure to watch and they have great chemistry on screen. I was also very impressed by 19th century London. CGI has come a long way.
  The main reason that I do not give this movie 5 stars is due to the plot itself which I will not go into here. (I don't like SPOILERS)  I will just say that though we are most likely being set up for a sequel I felt the story could have had a little more meat on it's bones.  Overall though,  I thought it was extremely entertaining.
  I still do not understand why there are so many saying that this new film is not faithful. Is it a word for word adaptation of the stories? No. The worst that could be said is that like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, Guy Ritchie has maintained the true ""spirit"" of the Holmes character -though I would say he has done much, much more.",1264982400,79,2541,4.535087719298246

However, Ritchie seems intent on making Holmes into one of these ultra profitable super heroes who can be milked for movie after movie.  Downey is so good that he comes very close to pulling this off but the script and director work at cross purposes with him. Where this really goes amiss is that Ritchie uses an over the top plot with this black magic practitioner villain who is just too much, sort of a Bela Lugosi on steroids.  Downey's character development moments are a lot better than anything going on in that plot contrivance. He is very good with the Irene Adler character.  He is also  humorous, as when Watson's girlfriend throws wine in his face or Irene drugs him and leaves him manacled to a hotel bed.  If we could combine the scripts which were used in the Jeremy Bret versions of Holmes with Downey Jr., we really might have something.  Downey is such a top talent that I don't think he should waste himself working with Ritchie.  He's got just about every first rate director lined up to use him and he ought to go with one of them.  I thought Rachel McAdams was quite good too.  Ritchie is not known for being good at working with women, in fact just the opposite.  McAdams somehow surmounts this and comes through as Irene.

Known for rough and tumble films featuring British gangsters and con men, not necessarily very smart men, who hold terrific grudges against one another, Ritchie's films are violent and excessive, but fun. They are almost fun because of the excessive violence. Ritchie is one of the first directors to popularize a filmmaking technique using stop motion and bullet action; someone throws a punch, the camera follows right behind the fist and at the moment of contact, the camera slows down and we see a point of view of the impact. As soon as the punch lands, the camera speeds up again, usually, even faster than before. This type of camera work is most commonly done with bullets shooting out of guns, the camera stopping just as the bullet passes the camera and we can see the trajectory. Normally, I hate it when a filmmaker uses a technique to excess because all it does is call attention to the filmmaker, taking us out of the story. But in the case of Ritchie, each of his films is so excessive, so over the top, he almost seems to be shouting his glee that he is able to make a new film. This sort of unheralded joy helps me overlook a lot.

When I first heard about ""Sherlock Holmes"", I was more than a little surprised Ritchie was at the helm. Generally his films are low budget independent features unraveling tales about the dark underside of London. Very little thinking is usually done because everyone is so busy trying to kill one another. Sherlock Holmes is character with a great mind, a person who spends a lot of time thinking, working problems through. He isn't a man prone to fist fights and explosions. The two don't mix.

Then, as the trailers began to invade the multiplex, I saw that Richie's version of ""Holmes"" could work. A fist fight features prominently, as do explosions, but it seemed to me that Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law were the perfect actors to play a modern interpretation of Holmes and Watson.

Other people in my family weren't so willing to go along for the ride, so I had to wait a day to see the film.

Holmes and Watson (Downey Jr. & Law, respectively) are instrumental in the capture of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a man who practices lack magic and is caught in the process of sacrificing another women. Months later, Watson is asked to be present at Blackwood's hanging. After Blackwood is hanged for his crimes, Watson checks the vital signs and verifies the man is dead. Soon, someone claims to have seen Blackwood rise from the grave and other people begin to see Blackwood also. Holmes and Watson are perplexed and set out to figure out how a man can rise from the dead. Along the way, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), an old flame of Holmes, returns and complicates his life. Irene has a checkered past and Holmes can not decide if he can fully trust her. As they investigate, it appears that Blackwood has a device that may prove a threat to England and eventually, to America.

One thing I think we can safely say about Richie's films is story has never been of paramount importance to the director. His films often make no sense, but engage us anyway because of the colorful characters he creates. Their dialogue and the situations they get into are often hilarious, interesting and unusual. How they get to these points, I doubt even Richie could explain to you. It's a bit like taking the characters played by Travolta and Jackson in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and listening to the famous Quarter Pounder speech with none of the other story or subtext Tarantino created. It works, but only because Ritchie seems to have such glee in making the situations his characters get into all the more preposterous and unusual.

""Holmes"" follows this same template. Downey Jr. is extremely engaging as Holmes. H9s Sherlock seems bored and fascinated at the same time by everything going on around him. Even when he is attempting to break up a relationship between Watson and his new fiance, he is more amused by the woman's protestations and the glass of wine she throws in his face than anything else. He doesn't seem surprised by anything. He and Watson have a love-hate relationship but they know they will be forever for years to come.

Law is very good as Watson. Exasperated by Holmes meddling and interference, he also respects the man's knowledge and abilities. He doesn't even seem to be that annoyed when Holmes tries to break up his relationship with his new fiance. He expects his friend to do something like this, so he isn't surprised. It is also nice to see Law play the 'muscles' of the team, something he doesn't do very often, if ever.

Strong is very good as Lord Blackwood. A recognizable character actor, he makes himself appear very mysterious and dangerous, a very suitable villain. He also recently appeared in ""The Young Victoria"" as an advisor to the future Queen's mother. When he enters a scene, his very visage makes him an imposing figure and more than a little ominous.

I was excited to see that Rachel McAdams was going to be in this film. But unfortunately, her character is still a bit of a mystery. She is supposed to be the long lost love of Holmes, a woman with a dubious past who jilted Holmes. Initially, she is mysterious and there are clues that she would be in jail if Holmes had revealed what he learned of her before. But she is meant to be a much more mysterious figure, someone who is working behind the scenes, maybe for the bad guys, maybe on behalf of Homes and Watson. This isn't handled well and leaves us feeling a bit unfulfilled.

There are many things done right in ""Sherlock Holmes"". Early on, Holmes is in a fistfight (Why? I doubt even Richie knows). Pitted against a man three times his size, he is game for the sport, but outmatched, so he has to figure out a way to best his opponent. Quickly, Richie cuts together a series of quick cuts illustrating how Holmes will take down the behemoth. Then, Holmes does it; each of the previous cuts a punctuation point in the new scene. These moments are very effective illustrations of the deductive reasoning that the detective is known for. Later, Richie switches it up a bit and uses this same technique to illustrate something Holmes has just done. These don't work as well.

Also interesting is a scene in which Holmes demonstrates his ability with disguise. But these interesting touches aren't done nearly enough and leave us wanting more.

As a major Hollywood studio produces this film, a famous producer, director and stars are all involved, a sequel is almost inevitable. Everyone involved seems to be clearly invested in this idea and the film ends with the appearance of a new character that is certain to feature prominently in future films.

I don't like most sequels. I don't even like the idea of most sequels. Most are far inferior to the original and only serve as a way for the people involved to get ""sequel money"". What do I like even less? A new film created with a sequel in mind, the ending leading into the second film. It just seems slightly arrogant. We know this film is going to be so successful that a sequel is a sure thing. In the case of ""Sherlock Holmes"", I think the sequel has the potential of that rare class, the sequel that is better than the original. I hope everyone involved will be able to relax a bit and let the story and characters become more complex and deep. More ""Sherlock Holmes"".

2047251,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I saw Sherlock Holmes at my local theater and immediatley loved it. There is only one word to describe this film and that word is ""brilliant"".

The story takes place in Victorian England with a young detective named sherlock Holmes (Robert Downing Jr.) and his doctor named Watson. The film picks up at a mysterious temple in wich a human sacrifice is taking place. Luckely for the one being sacrificed Holmes, Watson, and the police come just in time to stop the killing.  The sacrifice was being performed by a devil-worshipper known as Lord Blackwood.  Blackwood is immediatley arrested and brought to trial for the murder of several women. He is sentenced to death and is hung. Later they bring the body to Watson and he pronounces Blackwood dead. But several days later a witness sees Blackwood rise from the grave in the local graveyard. Blackwood continues his killings and his powers are rapidly inflicting fear on the people of England. He plans to use this fear in order to in a way take over the world. Luckely Sherlock Holmes is such a brilliant detective that he can notice every minor detail in this case.

I highly recommend this movie. It is action-packed, frightning, and even hilarious. Although you my need to see the movie more than once, the plot is very difficult to grasp.",1264204800,,1295,4.742222222222222
2047252,3,B0001Z3TS4,"Robert Downey Jr.'s film career has been in and out of the toilet so often that he's become the sort of charismatic underdog that we Americans love rooting for.  Having battled drug addiction for many years, he has seemingly managed to conquer his demons, reinvigorating his movie career while reinventing himself as a bona fide, if unlikely, Hollywood superstar.  Yet, in spite of his aforementioned charisma, and despite the occasional brilliance of his performances (""Chaplin"", ""Zodiac""), Downey is not automatically the best choice for any role that comes along.  In ""Sherlock Holmes"", his casting as the title character seems like nothing more than a ploy to capitalize on his current box office popularity, rather than an attempt on the part of the filmmakers to conjure up any faithful rendering of the beloved detective.  It's like Tony Stark (from ""Iron Man"") has been given an English accent and transported to Victorian-era London; there's little difference between the two characters, and the plots of each film are easily interchangeable.  And, yes, Downey won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a comedy for this, although (a) ""Sherlock Holmes"" can scarcely be construed as a comedy, and (b) the Hollywood Foreign Press is notoriously not always the arbitrer of great cinema. Director Guy Ritchie has refashioned Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic Brit into his own cinematic mold: a modern-day action figure who's brilliance and arrogance is only exceeded by his athletic prowess and clever asides.  In other words, Holmes has been completely ""Hollywoodized"".  Ritchie could as easily have cast The Rock or Bruce Willis in the role, without it being any less credible.

Having said that, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is not a disaster.  Ritchie keeps things moving at lightning speed, and the computer visuals of London are spectacular, indeed.  As Watson, Jude Law is likable (though I could actually picture him as a more convincing Holmes) but even he is transformed into a Ninja-like tough guy when the game's afoot.  In supporting roles, Mark Strong is well cast as the evil Lord Blackwood, and Eddie Marsan and William Houston make the most of their roles as cops. As Holmes love interest/nemesis, Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler is gorgeous to look at but little more than a stereotypical damsel in distress.  Much has been made regarding the undertones of the relationship between the Holmes and Watson characters in this film, but I can't imagine anyone actually buying that.  The characters are so one-dimensional and the plot so blatantly un-subtle that any hints of romance between any of the characters is strictly lip service.  Law's financee, Mary (Kelly Reilly), appears a few times to uphold the idea that he's got a fiancee, and the audience is told that Downey and McAdams have a past together, but we really don't care; the female characters are mere plot devices.  Which is too bad because I think our inability to really care about the characters lessens the suspense.

Running at a little over two hours, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is too long by a good 20 minutes, but, with all the jumping, diving, and fisticuffs, you're more likely to be overcome by a headache than boredom.  There are much better Holmes films out there--from the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies to Jeremy Brett's memorable BBC series to Rupert Everett's lone 2004 effort--but this is a Holmes for fans of action movies, Guy Ritchie, and big budget Hollywood, not for purists, so take that for what it's worth.",1263772800,5,3492,5.055749128919861
2047253,5,B0001Z3TS4,"In 8th grade, my English teacher was so obsessed with Sherlock Holmes that I have not wanted to read or watch anything even mentioning Holmes.  But, almost 7 years later, I decided to give it a try (since I love Downey and Law).  I fell in love with this movie.

I read in a article with Guy Ritchie, before the movie came out, that he was nervous about people take on the martial arts Holmes.  But, then he pointed out that in the Sherlock Holmes stories, even Doyle mentions that Holmes has some martial arts training and skills...they just aren't shown in the stories (and what stories in that time period DID?).  And, come on, this is 2010.  Filmmakers know that if they want a movie to sell, they have to add action and violence in it (I mean, just look how well the Saw francise is doing).  I realize that there are die-hard Holmes fanatics out there that aren't happy with this, but really the only people that would go see a Holmes movie done like the originals are the older generation.

The movie itself, though, as I mentioned was amazing, in my opinion.  It had a story line that made me begin to think that it would end up like the newest Indiana Jones movie, but it was really summed up in a logical way at the end.  The music went so well with this movie that I ran out and bought the CD as soon as I could.  There was enough humor mixed in with the action to keep you laughing through the film...things like Holmes's experiments on the dog and the flashbacks that explain how he came to learn certain information.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can't wait for it to be released on DVD.",1263600000,2,1618,4.303630363036303

Any big budget movie that has no cusing and not one sex scene is pretty weird in todays world but this one does it with style and inteligence.
Do yourself a favor, sit down, buckle up, and open your mind and youll have a great time. This movie is not for the artsy just for those that want a great story ,done right, and a good time was had by all.",1263427200,2,603,3.9917355371900825
2047255,4,B0001Z3TS4,"If one is expecting to see Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's gentleman detective and reluctant side-kick when one attends a showing of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes they'll be sorely disappointed.  If one has held the view that Doyle's creation was best portrayed in movies by the suave and droll Basil Rathbone and the fumbling, slightly fussy Nigel Bruce, do be prepared for a bit of shake up.  If, however, one has been prepared for a Guy Ritchie extravaganza by viewing Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels, or Snatch, then what greats the eye and ear here will be neither shocking nor disappointing.  Casting the smarmy/sleazy Robert Downey Jr. (Natural Born Killers/U.S. Marshals) in the title role, and the always-underplayed Jude Law (Road To Perdition/Gattaca) as the amiable Dr. Watson is one's first clue things are not going to be Doyle-esque, and from the opening scene little doubt can remain.  All of the usual rough stuff one expects from Ritchie is found here, but to his credit the detecting craft which forms the core of a good mystery is not only present but used to a degree guaranteed to keep one's interest through the intermittent smashing-and-bashing scenes. Excellent eye-candy is provided by a pair of femmes, fragile and fatale, with Kelly Reilly taking the former position in the role of Dr. Watson's fiance and Rachel McAdams taking the latter in a role that will keep some guessing to the end (though true Doyle aficionados will early on recognize the man who seems to employ her).  Mark Strong turns in an okay performance as the evil Lord Blackwood and Eddie Marsan does a credible job as the bumbling Lestrade.  The Baker Street Irregulars are notable by their absence.  I can't say anything about the mystery, or more correctly the mysteries-within-mysteries, involved here without revealing too much other than to say this movie ranks high in the 'keep 'em guessing' category.  I'm looking forward to the dvd's release so I can watch it again and again.",1263427200,2,1980,4.942771084337349
2047256,4,B0001Z3TS4,"As a public watching Sherlock Holmes mysteries for well over fifty years, we have become accustomed to a certain Basil Rathbone stereotype--an intellectual in tweeds with a deerstalker hat, ""over six feet,"" ""sharp and piercing eyes"" and ""hawk-like nose""--that the character's creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, clearly delineates in his novels and short stories starring the legendary detective and his trusty sidekick, Dr. John Watson.  5' 9"" Robert Downey Jr. with his expressive milk chocolate eyes and rakish bad boy looks cannot be further off type.  Yet aficionados of Conan Doyle's famous sleuth cannot fail to find the inner Sherlock lurking in director Guy Ritchie (Madonna's X-Man) and Downey Jr. brash interpretation in the film ""Sherlock Holmes"" and look upon this with all the intrigue of watching the popular television character Monk hypochondriac his way through solving mysteries of his own.

Conan Doyle created not only a genius of deductive reasoning, but also a highly sophisticated human database with state-of-the-art archival and retrieval software that allows his mastermind to quickly wing his way through complicated problems with the 100% accuracy rate of a supercomputer.  As neatly architectured as the halls of Sherlock's brain may be, his private living space resembles something akin to a dwelling on an episode on A&E's `Hoarders.'  He struggles like all great minds with the ennui that comes with not enough stimulation, dresses with a bohemian flare to unconsciously promote his individualism and develops his strength and physical agility because he knows he should with the same passion and perseverance he would pursue the solution to that generation's Rubick's Cube.  Guy Ritchie's Sherlock may tilt the scale towards superhero classification, but let's face it, that's exactly what author Conan Doyle originally had in mind.  He just wasn't privy to 2010's technological advances.

Ritchie's Watson (Jude Law sporting an attractive mustache) and his eccentric housemate, Holmes present an interesting partnership between two men whose personalities play off each other like other great literary and film foils, i.e., Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.  Unlike the austere Rathbone and his counterpart, the slightly befuddled but kindly Nigel Bruce, this Holmes and Watson team are rife with less cozy or erudite idiosyncrasies--an ex-military man, Watson is impatient with a mean right foot and a gambling habit to temper while Holmes blows off steam at a Fight Club London and seems frequently depressed in his genius that in its exception denies him similarly calibered fellowship--yet pursue their quest with the modern intellectual acuity of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon and the intrepid doggedness and single mindedness of John Rambo.

As attractive as Rachel McAdams may be, she somehow seems like an add on meant to fill the bill for the film's requisite female presence and box office draw rather than an intrinsic and indispensable piece to the film's suspense puzzle or as a clue as to what adds vulnerability to Mr. Holmes otherwise impenetrable persona.  The donning of supposed ill-fitting men's clothes and high-heeled boots which certainly shouldn't wear so fetchingly in obvious 21st century bootilicious-ness during the climatic chase in the Parliament and bridge scene at the end of the film, epitomizes McAdams' brand of derring-do that seems forced, unnecessary and unrealistic.  Let's just say that her all-American good looks are too colorful for the grey-toned London that Ritchie expertly conjures up with a touch of Tim Burton's macabre nightmarish reality.

Scenery-wise, Richie excels.  His London is a masterpiece of soot and chamber pots.  Rats and cobblestones aside, his vision transports the audience to the height of the industrial revolution with all its glories and pitfalls.  His scenes on the Thames are awash with rain and fog; the action on the half-built bridge sways with feelings of vertigo secondary only to a real-action roller coaster ride.

The only concrete failing of this flick is the plotline.  Attempting to depict the age with its concentration on the occult--the villain of the piece definitely bears resemblance to the historical Aleister Crowley--screenwriters Johnson, Peckham and Kinberg try too hard to evoke a supernatural Da Vinci Code conundrum that doesn't have enough plot layers and relies a little too heavily on spectacular computer-generated images and pyrotechnics.

Bottom line?  Guy Ritchie puts together Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr as the quintessential detective partnership in his film ""Sherlock Holmes"" with an eye on what goes on beneath the surface, warts and all.  With its cliffhanger ending, this one is sure to be the beginning of a franchise I am sure Ritchie hopes to perpetuate with the longevity of the older Holmesian adventures of the 30s and 40s starring Rathbone and Bruce.  Recommended for its wonderfully recreated and imaginative London of the late 19th century with a caveat regarding the rather slow storyline.

2047257,5,B0001Z3TS4,"After reading the reviews from some of the critics I was surprised by how many of them talked disdainfully about this movie as a divergence from the source material. I'm assuming many of them were relying on the old Basil Rathbone movies to color their interpretation of Holmes. They seem to overlook the fact that in the actual novels and stories penned by Doyle Holmes was an artistically tempermental, manic depressive, physically powerful individual who annoyed Watson by conducting experiments in their shared flat. He had been a prize fighter under another name, he was a cocaine addict and, according to ""the Adventure of the Empty House"" he was skilled in one of the earliest ""mixed martial arts"", Bartitsu (misspelled by Doyle as ""Baritsu""). Watson was a formidable former Army doctor discharged due to complications from a shoulder injury sustained in heavy combat while serving in Afghanistan. In many ways their depiction in this movie is much closer to their depiction by Doyle than what we've seen in the past. I am especially gratified that they finally did away with the ludicrously out of place deerstalker cap that became a staple of the Holmes movies due to one of the original Padget illustrations and which made no sense for the character when he was in an urban setting.",1263081600,760,1292,4.931192660550459
2047258,4,B0001Z3TS4,"As Dr. Watson (Jude Law) plans to move out of the home he shares with Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and dissolve their partnership, a piece from their last case comes back to haunt him. Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), sentenced to hanging for the murders of young women in association with cult practices, seemingly rises from the grave after his death was overseen by Dr. Watson. With Lord Blackwood's black magic ties sending British commoners into a frenzy, Holmes must find the truth behind Blackwood to return peace to England and clear his dear friend's name.

Sherlock Holmes is a hard character to pin down. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle seemed to be unconcerned with continuity when it came to his famous detective, and as a result Holmes has continuously changed throughout his novels and it's many adaptations. When Holmes first appeared in a novel, Doyle wrote him as a detective lacking in general knowledge, but later gave him a plethora of knowledge. From there even more inconsistencies in Holmes's character exist at times he's lazy at others he's energetic and industrious, emotional and at others he's full of emotion, and so on. When Holmes finally reached the screen (particularly with 1939's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), though, he was pretty much defined as an upperclass no nonsense brilliant detective with a corn cob pipe and wearing a deerstalker hat who uses smarts instead of brute strength, and Watson as his larger and inferior accomplice. With the new Holmes adaptation, though, the filmmakers opted to follow the source material a bit more faithfully. So how does this new adaptation stand up to prior adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character?

I'm not sure if the new Sherlock Holmes will make you forget about Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, or all the others who protrayed Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson before, but it does a great job of defining the duo for a new generation. Guy Ritchie, best known for his neo-gangster flicks Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, injects Sherlock Holmes with a shot of adrenaline moving the movie along at a cheetah's pace that at the end of nearly two and a half hours makes you wonder where the time has gone. One of the more controversial things that Ritchie brought back to the character of Holmes was his abilities as a street fighter and martial artist. In the books Holmes was a brawler at times, but wasn't portrayed that way in the adaptations that came after. With the way that Ritchie does it it's understandable that Holmes is a fighter. In the first scene we meet Holmes he is about to take out a guard to find Lord Blackwood, and as he observes the man he finds the guard's weaknesses, and before he steps out of the shadows he formulates a step by step plan to take the man out before doing so in the same manner he just planned. Not only does this give an explanation for such a change in the character, but it also shows us just how this great detective thinks and what we can expect of him.

Naturally, the movie is really about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, and they carry their characters superbly. We've come to expect great things from Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law and they never let us down in this movie. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Sherlock Holmes is never over the top, and is even slightly understated. We completely buy that Downey is Holmes and that he is this highly intelligent detective. We also feel Holmes's disappointment at losing Watson, even if the emotion is bubbling underneath rather than lying naked on the face of the character. Law does a great job at playing the straight man to Downey's somewhat odd Holmes. You really get the feeling that Watson is the glue that holds Holmes together, but his exasperation with Holmes at times is palpable even though you also feel that hidden feeling that Watson doesn't want to leave Holmes behind, and may even be worried about where Holmes would end up without him. The chemistry between the two leads is amazing, and ups the ""bromance"" level of these two leads as we watch them bicker like an old married couple.

The film isn't without it's flaws though. Rachel McAdams is criminally underused as Irene Adler, and isn't completely fleshed out. While this makes for great suspense as you try to figure out exactly what her game is throughout the movie, I still feel as though she could have been written better. Mark Strong's Lord Blackwell is also underwritten, and this would typically be okay considering that his character is supposed to be mysterious and hard to pinpoint, but the problem here is that the underwriting leaves him feeling not as menacing as I feel he should have been. Also, Ritchie's frenetic camera work can at times make it hard to follow the more high octane action sequences and knockdown drag out fights. Also the writing leaves you with the inability to be able to figure out some of the mysteries on your own, which is part of the fun of watching an old school detective mystery.

All in all though, this movie is a great mystery action movie. I highly recommend it if you, like me, are getting tired of the highly scientific mystery stories that have been bombarding the media as of late, or if you're just looking for a highly intelligent thriller/ action movie. Personally, I'll be owning this movie the moment it comes out on DVD and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel that will be coming later.

2047259,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Just saw this one in the theater and from an entertainment perspective, I thought it was excellent!  The show was about 1  hours and it was full of verbal banter, action, fight scenes, comedy, stunts, destruction, and ""almost-met-your-maker"" scenes.  There was also a slow motion explosion scene.

Robert Downey Jr (Holmes) and Jude Law (Watson) are fine actors and they had a wonderful screen-charisma together.  They came off like two best friends who would do anything for each other but would also not hesitate to give each other a hard time.  Early on in the picture, you even see Watson poke Holmes in the nose.  The guys lived together and shared a dog.  Not sure of breed, but it looked like a footstool.  Maybe an English Bulldog?  Holmes was great at deductive reasoning and they showed you his visions of how he saw something in his mind as he was looking at clues.  Watson was a doctor, so he looked at things from a medical perspective.

The basic plot centered on Lord Blackwood and a secret magical society.  Blackwood was into black magic and was convicted of sorcery (or something like that) and of killing five ladies.  Before Blackwood was hung, he told Holmes that 3 more would die and that Blackwood was part of a larger scheme of things.

After Blackwood's death, the locals started reporting they had seen him walking around.  Because Blackwood was into the black arts, people started getting scared.  The movie is about using black magic to create fear.  With fear comes the potential to have power over people.

I found the movie thoroughly enjoyable and fast moving.  It was also entertaining without blood and guts and shock value.  In other words, when you saw somebody die, they did not get disgusting about it.  I don't remember any foul language either.",1262995200,,1784,4.761437908496732

2047261,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I really enjoyed this movie, much more that I was expecting.  I went to see this with my wife.  I knowing next to nothing about the source material, my wife having read all the stories.  We both enjoyed the movie.  I think part of the problem that people have with this movie is the baggage that comes with Sherlock Holmes.  People have this image of the man, that is burned into our brains, which is also largely the invention of the BBC ages ago, and not what the character really was in the stories.  I would highly suggest that you leave your image of Sherlock Holmes at the door if you decide to see this movie.

After watching the movie I picked up my wifes copy of ""A Study in Scarlet"" and found surprisingly that the performances in this peace worked nicely in the original stories.  In the first story Watson is introduced to Holmes from a mutual friend.  The first thing Holmes does is maniclly explaining a test he just developed to spot a small trace of blood, then say he needs a roommate, and followed by Holmes rattling off why he makes a horrible roommate.  Watson finds it refreshing, but the mania that Downey shows in his performance fits in very well with this description.

So to put it bluntly, I have a feeling people who don't like this movie because it's ""not Sherlock Holmes"" probably haven't read the source material with a critical eye, and the image of Sherlock in their mind is from the media.  Now given I read the first part of the first story so I'm hardly an expert here, but just some food for thought.

As for the movie I found it to be very well done.  The script is very clever and none of the dialogue or characters made me cringe.  Downey portrays Holmes as he was in the stories, addicted to drugs, manic depressive, odd, and far to blunt for his own good.  Jude Law is also very good as a very witty able Watson.  Most people think Watson to be a fool (again due to the old BBC show), but in the stories after a time Watson does become a good investigator in his own right.  The bit in the middle of the movie were Watson decides that the owner of a watch must be an alcoholic is lifted straight from the stories.

The plot kept me guessing the whole time, and was presented in such a way as to not be to obvious.  The ending got a little action movie, but I forgave it.  The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is amazing and is something I am going to pick up when it is released.  For an action movie with four action sequences, I was highly entertained.

I will give the producers credit, getting Guy Ritchie to direct and casting Robert Downey Jr. in the role, but all the changes are cosmetic; Holmes is exactly what you expect, making deductions with a glance that would take the crew of ""CSI"" a whole episode.  In this, he's been given some brawling skills and a more dashing wardrobe, but there's no real major changes in the interpretation, unlike what they did with James Bond in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MNP2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>.

But they had some opportunities; there are several scenes in which Watson and Irene Sadler--Holmes' love interest--are seemingly killed, and I thought to myself, ""NOW it's going to get good!""  But alas, no; his compatriots manage to escape serious harm, and any real challenges to Holmes as a person slipped away.  But still, a nod must be given to the makers for at least trying to do something different, unlike some other recent films--namely ""Avatar"".",1262822400,,1118,5.864197530864198
2047263,4,B0001Z3TS4,"As commodity entertainment goes, this has just about everything. Robert Downey Jr. gets plenty of chance to practice amusing throw-away lines. There's plenty of action, a chaste and ambivalent romantic interest, a little steam-punk gadgeteering, and at least the facade of familiar characters - with enough new ones thrown into to keep the interest level up.

That said, Arthur Conan Doyle would probably sue the pants off whoever did this to his characters. Holmes came across as much less emotionally stable and a lot more needy than the steely character from ACD's original. That ""Fight Club"" scene probably wouldn't have gone over too well either. And ... well lots.

I'm not an ACD purist, though. I just wanted a fun flick, and certainly got my money's worth.

2047264,4,B0001Z3TS4,"This is a very entertaining movie with a plot that seems to take parts from ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" with a little James Bond, a dash of Jackie Chan, and seasoned with a little John Gielgud from Arthur.  Very entertaining but it is unlikely that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would recognize his creation.  Nevertheless and as much as it pains me to say so, Sherlock - as disgusting and unkempt as he was - was interesting and entertaining and managed to keep some of the key parts of the original.  The cinematography was spectacular, the set designs outstanding, the costumes excellent, the personal hygiene bad even for the period and Holmes needed to be tubbed and scrubbed and shaved throughout the whole movie. But thepoor hygiene really didn't detract from the action, it just comes across as Hollywood's inability to overlook current styles in favor of period reality.  The screen play was well done for the most part and the direction by Ritchie better than his usual.  There were the obligatory explosions and cliff hanging endings ala Perils of Pauline, but I do give him credit for well conducted fight scenes.  Although the actual fights were afflicted by the usual rapid jump cuts, Ritchie gives us the entire sequence in slow motion with an explanation of what is about to happen.  I thought this was particularly well done. The chemistry between Law and Downey was excellent and Law and gave the depth and character to Dr Watson that has been missing in virtually all other film efforts.  Usually Sherlock has been the focus and Watson an also ran, but here we find Watson a heavy hitter and an important part of the team.  I felt the addition of the two females seemed to be there for the sole purpose of defining the sexuality of Holmes and Watson which has always been a little vague and in this film their relationship would otherwise be very ambiguous, but this was cleared up by inserting the ladies, who did contribute to momentum of the film.  The banter between Holmes and Watson was very good and very underplayed much like Gielgud's comments in the movie ""Arthur"". These quips went by so fast if you weren't paying attention you could miss them.  The settings for 19th Century London were very good and certainly gave you a feel for the grit and grime of the city which was contrasted through the few examples of the middle and upper classes.  This is a good and entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it and recommend it to even hardened Sherlock Fans.",1262822400,,2464,4.702325581395349

Well, what do you know?  Guy Ritchie has gone all high-tech and mega-budget on our arses in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" the umpteenth movie incarnation of the world's most famous literary detective.

As embodied by Robert Downey Jr., this Holmes is no brandy-sniffing, pipe-smoking effete intellectual, spending his time peering at clues through an enlarged magnifying-glass, but rather a rough-and-tumble, athletic bad boy who boxes in his spare time, swan dives into the Thames to escape a villain, and performs more acts of death-defying derring-do than 007 on a busy day.  In this installment, Holmes is locked in mortal combat with the dreaded Lord Blackburn, a murderous cult leader who miraculously returns from the dead after being hanged for his crimes.  Jude Law plays Dr. Watson, Holmes' friend, confidante and personal physician, who is thinking of dissolving their crime-fighting partnership in favor of blessed domesticity in the form of marriage to one Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly).  Rounding out the cast is Rachel McAdams as Holmes' one true love who just happens to be entangled in Blackburn's nefarious schemes.

As written by Robert Michael Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is long and loud and filled with enough explosions and detonations to keep the most restless 21st Century action movie fan rooted firmly to his seat.  But all the stunt work and pyrotechnics are ultimately wasted in the service of one of those trite and tiresome plot-to-take-over-the-world scenarios that have become practically de rigueur in the world of big budget spectaculars these days.  The Victorian Era period detail is nice, but it would have been a great deal nicer had cinematographer Philippe Rousselot seen fit to crank up the lighting a notch or two so we might actually be able to SEE some of it (hopefully, this flaw will be rectified in the DVD version).

That leaves us pretty much with the acting, which is dependably good given the caliber of the players involved.  So revel in the performances and ignore the rest.",1262563200,3,2056,5.1441441441441444
2047266,5,B0001Z3TS4,"OK - NOW THAT THAT'S OVER WITH MINNIE ......what a delightfully sordid picture of Victorian London our boy Richie has cooked up for us with lots of nasty little rattling deaths, lots of sewers - people popping in and out of orifices and then there's magic?

Downey is manic depressive as Holmes desperately in need of a fix - opium, ritalin, prozac, ambien?  Law is the dutiful studly doctor  - a little on the lean side - but what the hell, McAdams seems to be chanelling Joan Collins ala Dynasty, yet all the silliness and the staccato Noel Coward inspired dialogue clicks, well.  Flamenco dialogue - that's it!

Strong is a dead ringer for ANDY GARCIA  ...  also slightly  Udo Kier at his most serpentine.

Fun plot [let's not drag ""the Order of the Golden Dawn"" and the misguided Aleister Crowley into this one .........different story folkies] but the mumbo jumbo rings true especially about crowd/population control through fearbush .....

CGI - tremendous - who the hell would like to visit London after this vision?  Costumes - period perfect - almost too crisp on the ladies, nice touch - the boot bottoms of Watson - those little brass shoe nails.... nothing amiss there.

Sequel?  Natch ...... Moriarty was vaguely introduced ......  anyone but dull boring old Feinnes please.....CGI HEAT LEDGER?  WHY NOT?

more please .....

ps. IF the occult has nothing to do with the baddie - why have the raven appear ...always before a nasty moment?

Moriarty?  Maybe Brad Pitt, Daniel-Day Lewis, someone devilishly likeable, but Oh So Lethal!!!  Heath Ledger?  Nothing's impossible - ask James C.

Zimmer's music ......jarring banjo stuff - effective, but far more suitable to a spaghetti western .....which some of this pastiche came close to - lots of comfort food.

2047267,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Let me begin by saying this is written from the perspective of someone who has long been a major fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes stories. They were some of the first non-children's works I ever read, and it was a yearly ritual to read them all consecutively. I did so for a long time and have read them on other occasions in various combinations. I thus unsurprisingly approached the film with a highly critical eye and a perhaps more than healthy dose of skepticism. As with many fans of the stories, Holmes is more real to me than many real people, and I would take any faulty adaptation very seriously - almost personally. I am therefore very glad to say I was pleasantly surprised.

Perhaps the most important thing to note is that it aims at both those familiar with the stories and those who have never read them, probably the latter primarily. This will inevitably annoy some purists but was necessary to gain wide appeal and, in my view at least, a nice balance was achieved. Some have complained that very little background is given at the front, apparently assuming it is known to all. However, everything is clear well before the end, and hard-cores will appreciate their time not being wasted. Far more important to fans is that the film does not follow a specific Doyle story. The general background is used, including of course the characters, but the chronology is somewhat changed; for example, a difference in how Watson meets his wife and moves from Baker Street threw me at first. Elements of various tales are used here and there, but this is essentially a new mystery. Any hard-cores limiting themselves to canonical plot adaptations thus should not even bother - but they will be missing out. The mystery is a Doyle-esque classic and, while not coming close to the master's best, the honest must admit it is quite a bit better than his worst. Anyone who loves the stories will find much to appreciate, as many classic elements are used. It is even an unexpected treat for hard-cores in some ways, as they can experience suspense and entertainment not possible when the plot is known.

There are many other non-canonical elements; most are essentially neutral, but hard-cores will quibble to various extents. For example, as nearly always in Hollywood adaptations, there is a significant action increase. It may not be hyperbole to say there is more action - in the Hollywood sense - than in all the stories combined. I feared this, and what I heard and saw made me worry it would ruin the film. However, at least in my view, it thankfully does not. It is not pushed too far and, though sometimes improbable, is not more so than in some stories - and is certainly mild compared to most films. The fact that non-Holmes fans have complained there is too little action testifies to this. Some hard-cores have complained loudly, but it is all fairly well integrated; there is really nothing gratuitous and contrived. It is also important to remember that the stories have a fair amount of action; some were indeed almost the equivalent of Hollywood action films by Victorian standards. This is easy to forget, and some would apparently like to deny it. It is also worth noting, for what it is worth, that Doyle could hardly have gotten away with such a thing in his time and place. For all we know, he was holding back and would have fully approved of this.

Hollywood is also infamous for sexing up literature, which is done here to a far lesser extent. No actual sex is shown, but there is significantly more suggestiveness than in the stories. In particular, Holmes' implied love for Irene Adler - a major character here despite appearing in only one story and being mentioned in a few others - is made fairly clear. This is shown in various ways that, while incredibly mild by Hollywood standards, may be too much for some hard-cores. However, this again is skillfully made to arise naturally and is after all plausibly extrapolated from the stories. Doyle was even more cramped here and may well have sketched the relationship out far more if he could have. More importantly, in contrast to the action, we can see the director and writers consciously holding back and should appreciate it.

The other non-canonical elements are essentially subjective; any given one will annoy some hard-cores while leaving others unfazed. I swallow most of them whole, and none annoy me particularly. The most obvious and significant is the increased importance of Dr. Watson despite the story not being told from his point of view as nearly always in Doyle. He is far more active, especially in regard to action, and beefed up in other ways - not least in becoming a witty wisecracker. Holmes is certainly the central focus, but Watson threatens to steal the proverbial show at times and is never deemphasized as in the stories. This can only be blasphemy to those who believe Holmes should dominate but works in context. Those able to see the film as a film in itself, rather than mere appendage of the stories, can appreciate this. Those unable to will be disappointed, but even they should not let it ruin what is a very worthy adaptation. Remaining changes are mostly added personality quirks of little or no consequence spread out among the characters. They have no real effect on plot except in a scene where Holmes drinks wine that has been fixed by Adler after she has more or less seduced him. I do not believe the ""real"" Holmes would be so easily fooled, but this is nothing to quibble too much about; ditto for whatever bothers anyone else.

All this is of course irrelevant to those unfamiliar with the stories, who will probably enjoy the film even more. It is a well-wrought mystery and certainly far above standard Hollywood mystery or action/adventure fair. One would have to look unusually hard to find plot holes, and no major threads are left dangling. Despite a slow start, the picture soon becomes engaging and entertaining and never lets up. The uninitiated will get a great introduction to Holmes and Doyle, as well as the time and place, and hopefully be inspired to read the originals.

The film is an excellent adaptation in most respects. Director Guy Ritchie does a superb job of bringing Victorian London alive. His depictions are of course not always what I picture but are nearly always legitimate and evocative; the sights and sounds have that all-important ""right"" feel, and the cinematography is generally well-done. The music is basically effective and appropriate but occasionally overblown and arguably distracting. Ritchie's greatest accomplishment, though, is avoiding the corniness that so often plagues and nearly always ruins Holmes onscreen. Holmes is one of the most famous fictional characters and has been portrayed many times nearly from the beginning of cinema; making him and his world seem fresh and convincing is a significant accomplishment.

The real key is of course the acting, which is basically excellent. I had major doubts about the casting of all the main characters and was glad to be proven wrong. Robert Downey, Jr. certainly does not look like Holmes as I picture him or as nearly always depicted, and little effort was made to change this. Yet it works. This is undoubtedly due mostly to the fresh approach. Ritchie decided not to go with the famous coat and hat, which was probably a good idea; it had been done too often and had arguably become almost inherently corny. Downey, Jr. uses actual acting skills to portray Holmes convincingly; his British accent is dead-on, and he has the mannerisms down well. Holmes' observational skills are put forth well, though his explanations often go by so fast we have little time to appreciate them, in contrast to the stories, where we can reread and savor. All told, I was thoroughly impressed by Downey, Jr.'s Holmes.

Jude Law as Watson is at least as good. He has performed well in each film I have seen him in, but I just could not envision him as Watson. How glad I was, then, to see him be an excellent one. That he looks nothing like himself clearly helps, even though his Watson is significantly different from how I have always pictured the character as well as from most depictions. Freshness again pays off, and Law deserves credit for pulling off a role substantially different from most of what he has done. The closest thing to a complaint one can make about his performance is that he sometimes comes near stealing Downey, Jr.'s proverbial thunder.

The biggest worry for me was Rachel McAdams as Adler. I questioned the validity and effectiveness of enlarging the character in the first place. Apparently it is not enough for her to be crafty and beautiful (I see nothing in McAdams, but I guess that's just me); she also had to be nearly as physically tough as Law's Watson and with even less canonical basis. Casting her on top of this seemed a sure recipe for disaster - nay, a cheap lure for non-Holmes fans. Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised. Her performance is not great - certainly below Downey, Jr.'s and Law's - but more than adequate. She does not quite convey the intelligence and craftiness the character demands and fails to sound like someone from New Jersey but is at least basically convincing. A more appropriate choice could probably have been found, but she passes my rather strict standards and does not come anywhere near ruining the film.

The minor actors are also quite good. Eddie Marsan deserves special mention for a humorous Inspector Lestrade. Mark Strong and Robert Maillet make convincing villains even if they lean toward the overly melodramatic. Their roles push non-canonical elements near the breaking point and sometimes come dangerously near corniness. However, while this brings down the film slightly, it does not ruin it.

The ending is a shameless sequel ploy, but we should not be offended; not only is the film well-done, but the Holmes world is so vast that there is plenty of room for more. Many, many elements are not touched on or used only in passing, and it would be interesting to see them further developed. Even hard-cores who thoroughly enjoy the film will inevitably miss certain scenes and characters - including Holmes' brother Mycroft, who is mentioned but does not appear, and arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty, who has only a token role. I am personally glad of this last, as adaptations have almost invariably overplayed Moriarty's importance, leading to a gross exaggeration of his stature. He is after all only physically present in one story, plays a real role in only one more, and is mentioned in a further handful. It is time that he stopped overshadowing other characters and situations. The promised sequel will surely feature him prominently, but I am more than willing to give it a chance after this success.

In summary, I urge any ambivalent Holmes fans to see this; whatever prior adaptations may have been, this is a good one. It is not perfect, and there will of course be many things you will wish had been different. You will quibble and nitpick. However, it is a quality adaptation, and you should let yourself enjoy it. This can be easily done in regard to the stories - there are plenty of tit-bits thrown in for the discerning that will be unnoticed by casuals - and is even easier if we take the film on its own terms. It is of course very hard to do the latter when dealing with such famous material, but the film is good enough that we should try. No honest person can say it is truly great cinema, but then Doyle's Holmes is not truly great literature in the strict sense. However much we enjoy it, we should admit it does not reach the profound heights of, say, Victor Hugo or Fyodor Dostoevsky. This is of course not a bad thing; as C. S. Lewis wisely said, the only people who have a problem with escapism are jailers. Or, as I have long said, it may be escapism, but it's damn good escapism. Doyle's Holmes stories may be the greatest literary escapism ever, and the film is a fairly close equivalent; it may be the popcorn movie of the year.

Non-Holmes fans have even less reason to hesitate. This is an intelligent film with plenty of action and more than a few laughs. One would be very hard-pressed to find something more entertaining out now or on the horizon. Bring on the popcorn!",1262476800,2,12337,4.762038335670875

2047269,4,B0001Z3TS4,"It may be the fate of every popular character of screen fiction to be periodically redone; witness recent incarnations of James Bond and Batman.  In 2009's ""Sherlock Holmes"", director Guy Ritchie reimagines Holmes and sidekick Doctor Watson as Victorian Age action heroes.  Younger viewers may find the new Holmes and Watson quite exciting.  Older viewers familiar with Basil Rathbone or the superb Jeremy Brett may find this movie a little harder to like.

Robert Downey, Jr. is surprisingly effective as Holmes, extraordinary private detective and now master of the martial arts.  Ritchie invents some interesting visual techniques that let us see Holmes' famous powers of deduction at work.  Jude Law is a younger, leaner, and two-fisted Doctor Watson.  The two actors have good screen chemistry together; they bicker like a married couple but are a seamless team.  Rachel McAdams is Irene Adler, a rather dangerous love interest for Holmes, in a role very much expanded from its original.  Kelly Reilly is a fiesty and believable Mary Moristan from ""The Sign of Four"" as Watson's fiance.  Victorian London is recreated in graphic CGI detail.

The plot of ""Sherlock Holmes"" may be more problematic, a complicated mess involving a Lord Blackwood (a sinster Mark Armstrong) as the serial-murdering leader of an occult society, who has aspirations of ruling the world from London.  There are a number of well-done dramatic action sequences, and some decent humor, but the movie is overly long and a major villian is left at large as obvious setup for a sequel.  This reviewer wishes Ritchie had reworked one of the original stories.

""Sherlock Holmes"" is highly recommended as an entertaining experience for new fans of the iconic detective.  Older fans are encouraged to give the graphic novel-like presentation a try.",1262304000,,1819,5.181506849315069
2047270,4,B0001Z3TS4,"When I heard that Robert Downey Jr was going to play Sherlock Holmes, I had my doubts. Robert Downey Jr is an immensely talented actor, but could he play such a well established character as Sherlock Holmes ? If you're looking for a movie novelization of Conan Doyle's books, watch the Jeremy Brett episodes instead.

Guy Ritchie has definitely updated this version of Holmes to be a more modern man of action, but he still adheres to the original characterization. Holmes is described as being a talented boxer and fencer as well as having great strength. So, it's no surprize to see him engaging in fisticuffs. He's also described as being rude, insolent and at times morose. Whether or not he'd work hand in hand with Irene Adler is another issue. There are many parts of of this movie that seem very true to the books and others which are a modern update. I'd say that Guy Ritchie definitely took some poetic license with this movie. But, this does not detract from the story. This is a very entertaining movie.

Oddly enough, Robert Downey Jr was a surprizingly good (cerebral) choice to play Holmes. It certainly required out of box thinking to cast him. No, he doesn't look like the drawings from the Strand. He shouldn't. Once again, you can't compare him to any other portrayal of Holmes. This is a modern way to look at Holmes. In this version, he uses his brawn as much as his brain. As a personal note, find out who Robert Downey Jr's personal trainer is because RDJ is in amazing physical condition. While you can argue that Sherlock Holmes might not have fought in a pit, he would have felt uneasy in a social situation. In one scene where he's dinning with Watson and his fiancee, Mary, you see how uncomfortable he is in public places. You see how outside noises seem to disturb his neural processes. He can't block out the noise, he can't think clearly and it puts him on edge. RDJ is wonderful at displaying Holmes' brilliant mind and occasionally off putting eccentricities. Speaking of those eccentricities, the moments with the violin were a nice touch.

Now, also of considerable note was Jude Law. His Watson was absolutely spot on. He was wonderful. Nigel Bruce, God bless him, was nothing like the books. In fact, Jude Law's Watson is much closer to the book and that was a pleasant surprize. Watson was never supposed to be a bumbling old fool. Watson was supposed to be a competent retired military doctor. So, it makes sense that Holmes would have someone like Jude Law's Watson by his side. And Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have absolutely fabulous chemistry. You have to pay attention because their witty repartee is very rapid fire and very funny. When you see them arguing, it really does look like you're watching an old married couple. There is a off hand reference to them being brothers, not of blood, but of the soul. That's very true in this case. Holmes and Watson are portrayed as squabbling siblings. Can't live with each other and can't live with out.

Rachel McAdams does make a fetching Irene Adler, but her character does seem out of place in this story. I feel she was put in so that the film didn't seem like an old boys type of film. It is a very male dominated film and the Irene Adler character is supposed to add a bit of femininity. Here's my problem with her character. She's described as a master criminal in the movie. That was never the Irene Adler in the books. Yes, she bested Holmes and yes, she masqueraded in male costume and maybe Holmes was in love with her. But, in the movie, she's portrayed as a female Sherlock Holmes and that didn't sit right with me. Once again, this is a modern update of the Holmes story. The villain, Lord Blackwood, is portrayed by Mark Strong and he is very good. He has a very mellifluous voice that he uses to his advantage as Blackwood. I can't say if the black leather jacket was period to the 1880s, but it did lend a sense of malevolence to his character.

I will say that I appreciated that the art director showed London as it was in the 1890s i.e. dirty, grimy and crime infested. People should remember that the London atmosphere that produced Holmes, also produced Jack the Ripper. Of course, in some ways, you could compare Lord Blackwood to Jack the Ripper, but it isn't so neat. This is where the story does get a bit confusing and convoluted. Part of the story involves black magic and a secret society that may or may not be the Masons. The story doesn't always make sense and that's where the action compensates. I do think that Guy Ritchie did go a bit overboard with the action. He should have concentrated more on the story. In short, what the story lacked in coherency, it made up with great actions scenes and witty repartee between Holmes and Watson.

I enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed this film in spite of the weakness in the story. It's a surprizingly good take on the Holmes mythos.",1262304000,6,4896,4.557954545454545
2047271,2,B0001Z3TS4,"Director Guy Ritchie does violence to Sherlock Holmes. This movie is not awful as it is really disappointing.

So many new movies are written for a generation of people hooked on video games with a chronic inability to concentrate.  Since the intended audience is squirming around in their seats awaiting the next car/coach chase or fight scene there is no need for thought or logic. A character like Irene Adler is a friend to the Sherlock Holmes in one scene, and enemy in another, a friend later, then enemy etc. Since these viewers can't focus their attention, there is no need for a coherent plot. They won't think back to scene one - if she was Holmes friend, why did she do that then?? - because the audience, raised on violent nonsense video games doesn't care or can't remember that far back. (The same incoherent plot was in the last pathetic James Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"".)

This movie is all special effects. It turns the Sherlock Holmes character into a prize fighter, abandons all logic until a tack-on in the last five minutes. He carries a gun! In the books Watson had the gun, Sherlock usually used his brain (except in ""Hound of the Baskervilles"") . Logic thought and deduction, the hallmark of Sherlock Holmes, is all but forgotten for most of the movie. What's left is chases and fight scenes. Sherlock's bickering relationship with Watson is  like b*tchy arguing sessions between an old gay couple.

The London filthy industrial East End, is the Limehouse, (the one of the reasons Britons were called ""Limies""). Much of Limehouse/Whitechapel was destroyed by the Nazi's in WWII. Limehouse has somehow been moved miles upstream a block from the Houses of Parliament. The richest city in the world, the center of the 1880's universe, has been changed by the director into slums, docks, with filth, grime and large shipbuilding and large industry.  Not in Limehouse, but in the center of the city!

In about this historical timeframe, a brilliant but egotistical Aleister Crowley marched into the temple of occultist Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and demanded to take over and  oust the leader, McGregor  Mathers. He was tossed out on his ear. This really happened.  In this movie, behind the leaders of Parliament is a shadowy group of Egyptian/ pseudo Golden Dawn magicians peacefully running England in the background. The order is been taken over by Lord Blackwood, bent on ruling the world through fear, a character roughly modeled on Aleister Crowley, except he lacks Crowley's brains (and Crowley was never a black magician, never a satanist and never murdered anyone). Blackwood is just mean, a comic book villain psychopath who kills foes and uses stage magic and Egyptian mumbo jumbo to frighten anyone who doesn't agree with him.

The one bright spot in this garbage is Robert Downey Jr, who does the best he can with this terrible screenplay. He is convincing as the whip smart and idiosyncratic Holmes; he is conscious, he sees things everyone else misses. He gets bored without a case and shoots the Queen's initials ""VR"" in bullet holes his wall. (This is one of the few parts of the movies actually taken from Conan Doyle.)  If Downey had only been given a better script...That's why I give it 2 stars instead of one.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jeremy Brett are turning over in their graves. Avoid this Sherlock Holmes. See Avatar, another action-adventure movie, but a much better one. Rent Jeremy Brett and see the authentic Holmes.

2047272,3,B0001Z3TS4,"This was not a film I was really looking forward to; I thought the trailer looked absolutely horrible, like a dumbed-down buddy-cop movie transplanted into the Victorian age - and I'm not at all a fan of director Guy Ritchie.  So despite my appreciation for both Robert Downey Jr (Holmes) and Mark Strong (Lord Blackwood, the villain of the piece), I wasn't really sure until a week ago that I'd bother seeing it theatrically at all.  But what the heck, I love Holmes, even at his worst, so I went anyway.

So....going in with absolutely the lowest expectations possible, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  No, it wasn't a great movie, but I actually enjoyed myself for a good bit of the running time (which felt longer than it was, never a good sign at all but particularly in an action movie).  This Holmes and Watson are an action-movie buddy duo, get that straight right away.  You have to take it as a given that this won't bear too much relationship to Conan Doyle, and that the action is going to take precedence over any pretense of a meticulous or carefully worked-out plot.  The film begins with our heroes busting up an occult ritual, saving a half-naked girl from villain Blackwood's sacrifice, and it rarely pauses for reflection in it's more than two hours.

The plot's not bad - though some of the dialogue is, and the joking references and bits lifted from the stories are usually poorly placed and awkward - I guess they're supposed to be manna for the serious fans, but they seem like cynical moves often.  Essentially Holmes and Watson are about to break their partnership as Watson is about to get married, but Watson keeps getting drawn back to help Holmes in defeating the hanged but apparently still living Blackwood's plots which involve both ancient occult ceremonies and modern (too modern - the film verges on steampunk) weaponry.  Some have complained about these basic plot elements, but Holmes confronted religion and the occult and dealt with plots against the government many times in the stories.  It's the fast-action gloss on it all and the poor editing and crashing sound and overbearing music that really take one out of the 19th century, I think.

BUT...Downey and Jude Law (Dr. Watson) have an undeniable charisma, and there actually is a fair amount of deduction and detective work inserted in between the fighting and explosions.  And sometimes within the action sequences, as we see Holmes more than once analyze how best to take down an opponent, scientifically and in slow motion - and then do it exactly as planned, in trademark Ritchie fast-mo.  In fact it's the action sequences that are problematic, at least if you don't like Ritchie's fast-mo, fast-cutting style (thankfully not always in place and not as overdone here as in the other films I've seen).  The moments of conversation, the humor, and the character interactions between the two Baker Street roommates, and between Holmes and ladyfriend Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) worked pretty well.

As to Downey in particular, as he is really the reason this project got off the ground and got a significant budget and marketing, well he's great.  He's clearly doing his own thing - a physical, somewhat disreputable and ragged Holmes, which I think a case can be made for.  Holmes famously knew and cared nothing for most things in the world that didn't impact his work, and I think that an unshaven, dishevelled and unwashed Holmes works ok.  He's a man of action, but Downey always shows a penetrating, if somewhat tossed-off intellect.  He speaks very rapidly, it's as if his speech is trying to keep up with his mind and sometimes he's quite hard to understand - though the excessively loud and FX-heavy sound mix is probably as much to blame as he is.  The accent's OK I guess, but I'm not sure that matters a whole lot; as the film doesn't feel particularly Victorian why should it feel particularly British either?

So very much a mixed bag.  Certainly if you're looking for a faithful ""Sherlock Holmes"", you won't get it (though truth be told, most previous incarnations aren't all that close to Conan Doyle either); Ritchie's direction is as uninteresting and hamfisted as ever to me - he can't even compose an interesting shot as Michael Bay at least manages once in a while.  But the cast was for the most part solid and seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I had fun as long as I allowed my brain to idle.  If it's far from the best of all cinematic Holmes, it's probably not the worst either, and watching one of the greatest English-language actors under 50 today do his thing was always a pleasure.",1262131200,93,4624,4.75
2047273,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Holmes a martial artist?  That is one of the new directions the director took in the updated version that has Robert Downey Jr. as our favorite detective and Jude Law as a very tough Dr. Watson.  Sprinkle in a little Rachel McAdams as Irene, the one woman who intrigues Holmes.  Throw in CG graphics that bring 1890's London to life and we have a whole new Holmes.

A dark religious cult headed by Lord Blackstone is afoot that uses female sacrifice as one of their rituals.  Holmes bursts in on one of these attempted sacrifices and thwart Blackstone and LeStrad takes him into custody.  Three months later Blackstone is executed through hanging.  Just before he is hanged, he is visited by Holmes in prison and he tells Holmes that this is not over and three murders that Holmes will be powerless to stop will occur.

After Blackstone is pronounced dead he appears to have risen from the grave.  It is now up to Holmes and Watson to stop the three murders.  The first involves Blackstone's own father.

I generally liked this movie as I usually any adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.  The director shows Holmes at times using deduction to decide what he will do in a fight and how his opponent will react and then Holmes follows through on his deductions.  I really liked these parts of the film.  Downy is ok in the role though at times I had difficulty understanding things he said.  It is sometimes the bad thing about having a non-British person doing a British accent.

Jude Law does an excellent job in his role and he easily makes one not miss Nigel Bruce's bumbling interpretation.  If the viewer liked Johnny Depp's Sweeny Todd, you would definately like this film.",1262131200,2,1672,4.63265306122449

I saw this movie today in the theaters, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!  It left me breathless!!!  It doesn't aim to strictly follow Conan Doyle's portrayal of the characters like the Granada series did.  Nevertheless, the ""WOW!!"" factor of this movie was over the top and fantastic! I love how it digs into Holmes' psyche, and how the movie portrays the way his mind works. And Watson and Holmes' friendship/partnership was electrifying on screen.  I am praying for a sequel.  Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law did a fantastic job!",1262044800,,740,4.7637795275590555
2047275,3,B0001Z3TS4,"How was the movie?
Quite a decent period movie with brilliant sets (bridge under construction, the ship construction site etc.), good acting (mostly) and not a bad story. By itself it would classify as an easy 4 star affair.

But there is nothing Sherlocky about this movie.
If anything it was a missed opportunity to make a timeless classic character into a slightly more contemporary role in an interesting movie that would appeal to the movie going crowd of today. That is where I feel it failed.

If somebody is a Holmes fan like I am, it probably won't gel in. If you are not a Holmes fan and haven't read his stories, it won't make a difference anyway from what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created.

As an actor Robert Downey works very well. My problem is with the characterization of Holmes. In parts it is Holmes but mostly his eccentricities and brilliant thinking and deduction were lost in the movie. Only two parts that stand out in this regard are when Holmes goes to the restaurant with Dr. Watson and Mary Morstan (although the part was too short and too mumbly) and the last part when Holmes summarizes separately to the Home secretary and to Lord Blackwood how he uncovers their game (but again too mumbly). Both these parts out of a movie over 2 hours long don't do justice to the ""concept of Sherlock Holmes"".
And some of the things added to his character, like the bare fist fighting, martial arts fight scenes were, to be honest unnecessary for me.

Even if the movie was almost the same but the lead characters were called something else and the title was changed, it would still work as a decent movie worth your time and money.

One successful execution of (slightly) revamping a character that stands out in my mind is Batman. What Christopher Nolan did was to take just a decade old movie concept and revamped it, made it more modern, more edgy and vulnerable, more fun but not cartoonish but stayed true to the Bat roots. Now think of this movie like somebody makes a superman movie 20 years from now but this superman being who he is can also spin webs, drives a supermobile, wears a mask but can still run faster than a speeding bullet and has a body of steel - it might be a great movie but will not be superman movie.

As an aside, Judel Law/ Dr. Watson was fantastic. Irene Adler was again a misfit character. Any Holmes fan feels similar adulation for Ms. Adler as Holmes did - the only women to outwit him. Here Madam Adler seems more lost and in need of help.

Guy Ritchie and Lional Wigram had an opportunity to create a modern day legend of a 100 year old character. Unfortunately it is now gone for another few decades. If there is a sequel (there was a mention of Dr. Moriarty) and it stays along the lines of this movie, it will stil miss the loyal base. If it goes back to the original Holmes, it will probably alienate the crowd who liked this movie.

Anyway, watch it as an interesting and fast paced movie and it is worth the money for sure. I just wish ....",1262044800,2,2998,4.428312159709619
2047276,4,B0001Z3TS4,"This is definitely not a film for the Holmes purist, but I somehow think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would not object to this contemporary rendition of his classic detective novels.

This time, Sherlock (Robert Downey Junior) and Dr. John Watson are facing Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a murderer and member of a secret cabal of mages whose ambition is to take over England. The cabal's artifices are designed to make Lord Blackwood appear as though he has arisen from the dead. Further devices will poison the entire Parliament if they do not align themselves with the new order.  Our fearless duo is aided by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) and various others.

The film's fast-paced and takes us through a grittier more polluted London. Sherlock is not afraid to get his hands dirty and he's definitely depicted as a brilliant but dissolute individual.  Everything happens so quickly that you are really going to need to pay attention to keep up with the clues in this action packed epic.

2047277,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Sherlock Holmes has been identified by the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the most frequently used fictional characters in history.  Appearing first in the 60 stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he has subsequently went on to make hundreds (if not thousands) of appearances in novels, film, television, and radio, with the part essayed by a number of very talented actors, with Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett the most notable.  Adventures on the big screen have been slim pickings for a while (the last really notable one was 1985's ""Young Sherlock Holmes"", obviously a bit of a break with traditional formulas) as TV adaptations have been the go-to medium.  This new entry aims to jumpstart a new cinema franchise and introduce Holmes as a living character to a new generation of fans (as opposed to just being a cultural touchstone), with the assistance of talents like Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.  This has been met with understandable wariness by longtime fans, but I would say that overall the movie succeeds admirably at its goal.  Some spoilers follow.

The bare bones of the plot (summarized in innumerable places elsewhere):  Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) crack the case of a series of ritualistic murders and arrest the man responsible, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong; doing a lot of villain-work this year, and looking like a British crossbreed of Andy Garcia and Stanley Tucci).  However, even after Blackwood is hung by the neck until dead, trouble continues, and it appears that he may indeed have risen from the grave thanks to the black magic he claimed to possess.  Holmes is back on the trail of the seemingly-resurrected villain, while former acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) reenters the picture, in the employ of an anonymous stranger.  And on the domestic front, Watson is getting engaged to the nice Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) and preparing to move out of his Baker Street bachelor flat, much to Holmes' annoyance.

I would say that this film has been somewhat poorly-represented by its trailers and promotional material (not poorly served, though, if the box office returns are any measure), which plays up the action to a point that will turn off many diehards (though one imagines they'll still see it to feel the joy of bilious outrage).  While there is certainly more physicality to this production than to your average BBC adaptation, director Guy Ritchie retains the core of Holmes as a cerebral man (and, truth be told, Doyle's original knew his way around a fight, even if the author didn't spare much prose on depicting it).  Tastes change a bit, and, so long as the core of the character isn't lost, it's fine by me to show him in a few scraps.

Downey's Holmes is a brilliant/eccentric mind with addiction issues, and rather poor hygiene (I tend to think of him as being more precise, even when troubled, but whatever).  But he's always on top of things.  Saints be praised, though, for Jude Law's Watson, who will hopefully go a long way toward rescuing the character from the bumbling ghetto created by Nigel Bruce's characterization and carried on ever since.  Law gives us a strong, confident Watson who is an indispensible part of Holmes' operation, and possessed of considerable deductive prowess of his own.  The film really hangs on the Holmes/Watson interaction, and Downey and Law hit it off marvelously.  The film opens in media res (a smart move, really; it's not like anyone is unaware of who these characters are and how they work), and you get a palpable sense of two people who've been working together for a very long time.  The ladies threatening to intrude on this male-bonding exercise, McAdams and Reilly, are both fine, though the writers sometimes seem a bit unsure of what to do with Irene (they know enough about the mythos to know that Holmes isn't the romantic type, even if this is a bit more in that direction than most depictions, so this is a fairly mild case of Catwoman).  Mark Strong glowers and growls sufficiently as the villain.

While heavier on the action than your typical Holmes story, and a lot grimier in its production design (true to life, one imagines; outside of the upper class, Victorian London wasn't the cleanest of places), Ritchie and his writers retain a lot of the core Holmes story aspects.  A villain with seemingly mystical powers must be confronted, and Holmes' logical mind must inevitably pierce the veil and uncover the rational explanation behind it all (outlined in a marvelous little climactic scene).  And, as we find out, Holmes has been slowly building his case through the whole movie, but rarely letting anything on.  The film also does a pretty good job of making Holmes' end-of-film explanation visually interesting, rather than just a dull monologue.

The film ends with some quite obvious sequel setup, and given the box office numbers, it's pretty likely we'll see a ""Sherlock Holmes 2"" in a few years; I welcome it.",1261958400,4,4954,4.8818615751789975
2047278,3,B0001Z3TS4,"The film is about two Victorian Era Londoners; one is called Watson and is a doctor, the other's name is Holmes and he's a genius. They are friends. And that is all, folks.

Well, that is all this film has in common with Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Which in itself is not bad. As long as the new version provides $[...] bucks worth of entertainment, I'm all for change! However, Guy Ritchie's Holmes comes up about a dollar short. For one thing, there is very little story to this film. We learn the story mainly from quick dialogue exchanges during short breaks from fights, explosions, and chase scenes. The fights are so saturated with marshal arts moves, it makes you wander if there was a dojo on every corner of the Victorian Era London... (no, there wasn't). Consequently, Ritchie's Holmes spends more time doing high kicks and leaping out of tall buildings, then deducting. In fact, Holmes and Watson could have fallen back on successful careers as body guards! After the initial amusement wears off, well, there is not much left.

As for the story itself: for about 90% of the film we are led to believe Holmes is chasing a master of dark arts, a warlock. This makes you resist the story, since it is integral to Holmes' character to always have two feet firmly planted on the ground. You hope there is an earthly explanation for all the ""works of the devil"" our heroes encounter, but when it does come, it is already too late. By then, you have given up hope and thoroughly cursed Ritchie for ""ruining"" Holmes.

Yes, there are a few more minor problems one can mention, such as some parts of dialogue spoken incomprehensibly, choppy editing, and odd direction. Nonetheless, none of it would have made a difference if the story were still lacking. And Holmes has always been about a brilliantly clever story. It is what's missing here. No amount of kung fu hi jinx can make up for the lack of an intriguing plot. As for the film's entertainment value, it was there at points. The film was OK. A strong three star movie. Neither great, nor terrible, just ""meh"". Sometimes it's enough, even if a film does not live up to its potential.",1261958400,2,2152,4.613577023498695
2047279,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I haven't read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories in probably 25 years, although as a teenager, I read them all.  I was also an avid fan of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce versions of the stories.  (Although I'll state right now, the Rathbone films varied a great deal plot-wise from Doyle...however, the presentation of Holmes which he presented are probably the most widely accepted ""visions"" of Holmes even today.)  Regardless of the long absence from my reading schedule, I certainly remember enough to know that Holmes purists will have a difficult time with much of Guy Ritchie's unmistakably modern take on the character in SHERLOCK HOLMES.

However, if one can get past that, SHERLOCK HOLMES is a very enjoyable Holiday season entertainment.  It is NOT a great film, nor has it particularly aspired to be.  It exists to entertain exhausted family audiences looking for a break from the gluttony of Christmas-time.  It exists to be a hit that will spawn sequels.  And taken in that context, it is probably a better film than it needed to be.

The Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) & Watson (Jude Law) in this film are a much more physical bunch than we remember them.  Holmes is an excellent pugilist.  In fact, there are some excellent early scenes when Holmes is in a fist-fight and we hear his inner narrative as he puts together a logical plan for physically defeating his enemy.  It's a fairly clever way to mix the ""elementary, my dear Watson"" cerebral side of Holmes that we all know with the earthier qualities Ritchie and company want for him in this film.  On the other hand, Watson is young, dashing and quite smart himself.  This is actually nice, because so many films present Watson as a bit of a bumbling fool.  Conan Doyle did NOT present him this way...the man was a medical doctor after all.

The plot of the film IS a bit disappointing, because it feels like warmed-over DA VINCI code type stuff.  There is a secret society (not called the freemasons, but might as well be) that dabbles in science and magic and believes it can combine those to wield influence on the political world.  Naturally, one evil guy (Lord Blackwood, played by Ritchie favorite Mark Strong) has violent, nasty plants of his own to not only take over leadership of the society, but of England itself.  With everything from NATIONAL SECURITY to ANGELS & DEMONS relying on nefarious secret societies, I sure wish they could have come up with something else for SHERLOCK HOLMES.  The fun of the film is the verbal wit, the striking visual imaginings of London and many of the performances.  The writers apparently felt that a big-budget HOLMES required a James Bond villain, and to me it was actually a distraction because if felt SO very tired and unoriginal.

Rachel McAdams also makes a rather wan appearance as the one criminal (apparently a first-rate con artist) who ""got away,"" but is also the one woman who has stolen his heart.  He will actually make bad decisions because of her.  I get the idea of giving  Holmes a love interest...but the film misses the fact that Holmes & Watson are really a ""buddy team"" and that Holmes mostly loves Watson (platonically, of course).  If Downey & McAdams had generated some serious heat, perhaps it would have worked...but her character feels somewhat perfunctory, and as much as I usually like McAdams, there just isn't much for her to do here.

But the film has many strengths as well.  As I mentioned, it has a strong visual sense.  Extensive CGI is used to create sweeping vistas of a mid-19th century city.  We feel the dirt, the noise and the squalor.  And for the most part, the work is done very seamlessly and results in some moments that are quite lovely to look at.  There's a terrific scene set in a shipyard, where Holmes battles a very imposing bad guy.  They fight amongst a giant metal ship that is only partially constructed, and when all hell breaks loose, the combination of live action and CGI works very well to create a highly original climax for the scene.  Later, there is a lengthy sequence of explosions, shown in slow motion that really shows all the craftsmen at their best.  Holmes & Watson are thrown about very convincingly!  A much later scene, set on a partially completed bridge across the Thames is less successful in creating a suspension of disbelief...the scope of what they are attempting is just too big for the viewer not to think ""hey, that's all done on computer.""

And what of the core of the film, Holmes & Watson?  Well, Jude Law makes a very charming Watson.  He is exasperated with Holmes, yet clearly feels a strong bond with him and secretly enjoys their adventures, however inconvenient on his love life.  He's smart, sexy and suave.  While I don't know if Conan Doyle would ever have used ""sexy"" and ""suave"" to describe Watson, I think Ritchie's take on the character isn't actually too far off the mark.  And Downey is always a pleasure, even if his Holmes feels a little unlike the guy we know from the books.  He certainly doesn't don the deerstalker and the huge pipe.  He smokes a ""normal"" pipe and tends to costume himself in a variety of clothing.  But Downey lets us see the sharp mind that sees and analyzes every detail almost immediately.  Holmes comes across as just a tiny bit of a savant, a ""Rain Man"".  He talks to himself a great deal in a mumbly voice that he clearly can't stop.  He has difficulty caring about being socially correct.  Yet he's not a simplistic character.  He CAN care for people...he just expects them to accept him exactly as he is and understand that he can't change and wouldn't if he could.  Downey is a very smart actor, and so in many ways, this role is well suited to him.  He doesn't wear the part quite as well as he wore the role of IRON MAN, but he's still fun.

If you're looking for escapist entertainment, and understand that for this film, great ""art"" was not the goal, then I think you should be well entertained by this excellently crafted, energetic SHERLOCK HOLMES.",1261958400,,6030,4.660984848484849
2047280,5,B0001Z3TS4,"From the opening when horses seem to be galloping from the back of the theater, through the gray skies and industrial grime of the exteriors and the dinginess of most of the interiors, relieved occasionally by gorgeous jewel toned luxury, this Sherlock Holmes is grittier and much more raw then its predecessors--a Holmes for the millenium.

Robert Downey's Holmes is a brilliant brat. He borrows Watson's clothes without permission, insults Watson's fiance at their first meeting, and drives Mrs. Hudson to her wits' ends, but he's also a guy who knows his way around a boxing ring and the one you want on your side when facing doom in the form of Lord Blackwood, an executed murderer who resurfaces at the head of a black magic cult bent on world domination.

Jude Law's Watson is an understated sidekick to the flamboyant Holmes, but their relationship is more of a partnership than in typical Holmes/Watson duos. It's fun to watch the verbal sparring and exasperation which underlying affection makes sparkling rather than mean.  The supporting cast is excellent, as well. The movie plays fair with the viewer.  When Holmes explains how the crimes were carried out, we realize we saw the same clues at the same time he did. No deus ex machina here--it's all elementary.

This Sherlock Holmes is neither Jeremy Brett nor Basil Rathbone.  Viewers who expect to settle into a predictable detective yarn will be disappointed.  This Holmes is edgy, action packed and slightly uncomfortable, but more believable because of it.  It's smart and atmospheric, and well worth seeing.",1261958400,247,1576,5.011494252873563

I agree with the comments that the film is crammed with unnecessary and distracting jumpy editing; MTV is right.

I also found a third of the dialog incomprehensible and mumbled, with Robert Downey, Jr. being the worst offender. It was a pity that he happened to be the main character. I could mostly fill in the resultant blanks due to context, but it was very annoying. I grew up on BBC and American TV in New Zealand and pride myself on being able to understand pretty much any English accent, South African, or pretty much anything else. I'm not noticing any problems with my hearing or with understanding dialog in any other movies.

I didn't mind the anachronistic martial arts stuff. As others have pointed out, Guy Ritchie apparently has the Matrix 'Burly Brawl' DVD too.

The CG effects looked cheap and nasty (and not just after Avatar) and the sets dreary.

The plot was reasonable.

2047283,5,B0001Z3TS4,"I like that in this movie Holmes and Watson follow up Holmes' rally cry of ""The game's afoot"" by quoting the rest of the passage from HENRY V, from which that phrase originated. Credit where credit's due, after all. Critics and others have been slamming this flick as being too revisionist and veering away too much from A. Conan Doyle's time-honored aesthetics concerning the Great Detective. To which I say, it ain't as bad as all that and it doesn't blaspheme as much as the naysayers would claim.

I wasn't down with the trailer, no. My concern, that this Sherlock Holmes is way too robust and bare-chested and not engaged enough in cerebral work. The movie bore this out, and the dilemma for me then was to justify the slick action set pieces with my longstanding image of a staid drawing room puzzler featuring an arrogant Brit in a deerstalker cap, an Inverness cape, and puffing that meerschaum pipe. ""And what's up with the martial arts and the bare-knuckle brawling?"" complain the critics.

Director Guy Ritchie decided to go with a more physical Sherlock Holmes, and my initial gut reaction was ""What the ef?"" And then I remembered that Holmes was in fact an amateur boxer (SIGN OF THE FOUR, ""The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"") and did dabble in the martial arts discipline of ""Baritsu"" (""The Adventure of the Empty House,"" and it's actually called Bartitsu). One thing I really liked was how, even in combat, Holmes' mind keeps on working, calculating an array of debilitating blows and then flawlessly carrying them out. On the other hand, I don't recall Dr. Watson being such an eager two-fisted smiter of dudes, even if he was a war veteran. In fact, he sometimes charges into a melee ahead of Holmes.

The year 1890, and England is on the brink of a modern technological age. And yet this is also an era in which many sought guidance from the spiritual world and the supernatural. Five ritualistic murders have been committed, and Scotland Yard has got its clueless thumb up its bum. Tying in to this, Sherlock Holmes's services are hired to find a missing girl, and his investigations lead him and Watson in time to thwart the killing of a sixth victim. The perpetrator is nabbed, the identity that of the satanist Lord Blackwood, snaggletoothed and unrepentant. Blackwood is tried, convicted, and sentenced to hang. Blackwood insists that ""Death is only the beginning."" Not too long after, his tomb is found broken open, another corpse in place of his. ""The game's afoot."" (followed, of course, by the rest of King Henry's speech.)

I've read all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, as well as countless pastiches, and I'm saying that I really liked this movie. Guy Ritchie and his blokes seem to have made SHERLOCK HOLMES with an eye towards drawing in the younger, more action-oriented generation. And yet enough of the core elements are preserved to make the film relatable to me, and I'm fascinated by the changes wrought. This Watson, for instance, may not be as brilliant as the Watson in WITHOUT A CLUE (which, given, was more of a broad comedy-thriller) but here he's decisive, very competent and isn't at all subservient, more Holmes' equal than a befuddled sidekick. Watson is not without the smarts, although there's no mistaking the true brains of this partnership. Jude Law has to be the most physically imposing Dr. Watson ever onscreen.

A strength of the film is Law's chemistry with Downey, Jr. Rumor is that these two got to be really good friends on the set, and something of that shows in the film. It's fun seeing them play off each other, their interactions often funny and their bickering exchanges reeking of many shared adventures. One cutesy plot device has Watson ostensibly working on his last case with Holmes, as the good doc is about to enter happy marriage with Mary Marston. He's in the midst of moving out of 221B Baker Street, and Holmes, a bit jealous, is doing what he can to sabotage Watson's departure. I know, it all sounds a bit foofoo.

I don't think anyone can touch Jeremy Brett as THE Sherlock Holmes actor. Certainly not in ferociousness. But Robert Downey, Jr. brings a fresh interpretation, a more earthy physicality to the role, and a slovenly twitchiness, while keeping the self-absorbed, remote demeanor. And the entire time, Downey embodies a sense of prodigious intelligence. It's not your conventional Sherlock Holmes, what Downey does, but I think it works. One quality that's de-emphasized is Holmes' so-called misogyny, although it's understandable once it's learned that Irene Adler, the only adversary to best the Great Detective, is heavily featured. As ""the Woman,"" Rachel McAdams comes off as the lightweight actor here, although she's beautiful as ever. But, to me, she just doesn't ooze that presence one associates with a formidable manipulator like Irene Adler. Still, she and Downey have some nice romantic moments (I know, I know - mentioning ""romantic moments"" and ""Holmes"" in the same sentence is almost heresy).

Secret societies. A possibly dead dog. An absent ginger dwarf. A whiff of the paranormal. A plot against the British empire. A menacing villain who looks more like what Sherlock Holmes should look like, but who also looks like Andy Garcia. There's not as much attention paid to the observational sleuthing as I'd hoped, but there is that moment in which Holmes deduces off Mary Martston (to his later chagrin). The big explanation, when it comes at the end, is executed under flashy cuts and edits, and my reaction verged on the whatever.

But I really like this movie, and it's mostly because of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. The plot itself is serviceable. I guess I'm enough of a Sherlock Holmes fan to appreciate new interpretations, but not so fiercely devoted to the old school that I'd get in a super snit if someone mucks about with the mythos, especially when I find myself allowing for the changes. It's a new Sherlock Holmes, but not really... Can you deal?",1261872000,2,5974,4.855740922473013

But I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and most of the portrayals I've seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character.  In Guy Ritchie's film, as in Doyle's ""canon"", Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer, a martial artist, an iffy musician, an opera lover, a dabbler in many sciences, and a master of disguise.  Most importantly, he's an expert in logic and deduction.  He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson (Geraldine James) and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan).

The movie opens with Holmes and Watson apprehending serial killing Satanist Lord Blackwood (played broodingly by Mark Strong).  Blackwood is executed, but when he seemingly rises from the dead, the deductive duo must determine whether it's a supernatural occurrence or if there's a logical explanation.  It's exactly the type of mystery Doyle would have devised, with plenty of twists and opportunities for Holmes to show off his genius as he races to stop a plot to take over England and (gasp!) America.  Everything from the experiments Holmes performs in his Baker Street flat to his climatic revelation of the mystery on the Tower Bridge seems perfectly in line with Doyle's writing.

One of the only departures from the canon that bothered me was Sherlock's introduction to Dr. Watson's fiance, Mary Morstan, played as a delicate English rose by Kelly Reilly.  In the stories, Mary was Holmes' client in ""The Sign of Four"" before Holmes first encountered Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in ""A Scandal in Bohemia.""  Then again, the continuity of the stories was rarely important to filmmakers, or even to Sir Arthur, so I'm just nitpicking.

As a film on its own merits, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is almost perfect.  The movie's opening shot grabs you, and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles.  His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric.  Hans Zimmer's quirky score blends well with the film's tone and Downey Jr.'s off-kilter Holmes.  Meanwhile, Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool, competent sidekick.  Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops, he's the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes.  When he leaps into action, he relies on a sword-cane and a trusty revolver, while Sherlock favors a riding crop (which diehard fans will recall was his preferred method of self-defense in the canon).  Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock's classic adversary into a feisty action heroine.  All the while, another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.

Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond, he doesn't feel any less like Sherlock Holmes.  Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock's fighting as a mental exercise as much as it's a physical feat.  In the same way, though ""Sherlock Holmes"" is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie's usual films, it doesn't feel any less like Guy Ritchie.",1261872000,2,3234,5.0508474576271185
2047285,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Dropped into my nearly capacity-filled theater today and checked out Holmes, a story modernized and reimagined from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's imaginings some hundred years back.  Wow, what a movie!  But Director Guy Ritchie's version may not sit well will dyed-in-the-wool Sherlockians!

The non-stop action was really top notch.  In fact the action was a bit too non-stop.  We're introduced to a woman whom Sherlock has some ""history"" but that history is only hinted at, not explored, which I think is a weak point in the film.  Without giving too much away, Moriarity (Holmes' arch-enemy in the novels and the Rathbone films) doesn't play much of a part, though he's always in the background.

Mysticism:  The bad guy is a mystic, running a cult of blood and sacrifice, who has plans for world domination.  In fact, one of Blackstone's first acts is to survive a hanging, kill everyone in Parliment and then move on to ""take back the Colonies"".

Fighting:  Holmes is great in analyzing where to hit and what to break on someone's face!  Powers of deduction will satisfy any Holmes' fan.

Explosions and pugilism:  Yeah, there's boxing, drinking, smoking a pipe and an explosion or two.  The CGI Industrial English background and Tower Bridge are realistic but not overly done.

Watson:  He wants to move out and marry Mary, a woman that Holmes figures out just by looking at her, which earns him a face full of wine!  Watson is a smart guy, not this foil that is bounced off of from Holmes as the old movies were.  In fact, he joins in the fighting in great style.

I found the musical score fast-paced and mood inspired.

Bad points:  Not enough plot, really.  Lots of character development of the main characters and lots of loose ends are tied up in the end.  But more story would have been nicer!

A must-see for the end of 2009!",1261872000,4,1834,4.6918238993710695
2047286,5,B0001Z3TS4,"""Sherlock Holmes"" is an obvious attempt at a franchise for literature's most popular detective, who was earlier portrayed in films by Basil Rathbone and on television by Jeremy Brett. Both of these previous portrayals were more or less faithful to the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original, albeit it someone adapted in Rathbone's case since his Holmes fought Nazis.

The 2009 version, directed by popular British comic crime caper director Guy Ritchie, is definitely an updated version. Robery Downey Jr's Holmes is like the classic character in that he is a disturbed, tortured genius who is a loner except for his constant companion Dr. John Watson. He differs from the archtype by being more of a bon vivant loner. His Holmes is someone who fits easier into society when he wants to fit in, where the old Holmes will standout regardless of what he tries to do. Moreover, traditionally, Dr. Watson is a doddering, deferential sidekick whose chief attributes are his knowledge of medicine, his trusty revolver, and by being the chronicler of Holmes' cases. But Jude Law's Watson is strong and intelligent in his own right, does not suffer Holmes' eccentricities lightly, and is more than able to handle himself in a fight.

The plot, which includes a plot by a noble to take over the world, involves Holmes' female foil Irene Adler (played by Rachel McAdams) and a Freemasons-like secret society is entertaining, but the biggest mystery is whether Ritchie et al pull this adaptation off, and they do with a charm and panache that begs for more adventures. I look forward to seeing what other adventures this new Holmes/Watson have under their Victorian sleeves.",1261872000,,1669,5.0
2047287,5,B0001Z3TS4,"Best action, best lady, and best of all Holmes is not played as an idiot. Great film experience from a dedicated Sherlock Holmes fan since childhood.",1261872000,,149,4.769230769230769
2047288,4,B0001Z3TS4,"Given the idiocy of most action pictures, the wit and verve on display here is refreshing.  Ritchie also finds new ways to stage hackneyed action tropes, as per the Big Explosion that climaxes the second act of the film.  He cuts the sound, and for once we actually feel the toll the explosion takes on the main characters instead of just watching them leap toward the camera as flames rise behind them.  It's wonderfully orchestrated -- and I hate explosions.  But Ritchie's real distinction is his attention to character and subtext.  Though it's disconcerted straight male critics (who get disoriented when movies don't support their heterocentric worldview) and studio executives fearful of a homophobic public (with cause, possums), this is distinctly a love story (crossed with a screwball comedy) between Holmes and Watson, all the more winning because it's implied and not shown.  Downey, Jr. and Law have great screen chemistry.  If this episode doesn't quite levitate all the way as a pop entertainment (blame a too complex plot) I'll still bet on the successful future of franchise.",1261872000,3,1093,5.106741573033708
2047289,3,B0001Z3TS4,"I consider myself a Sherlock Holmes fan. I won't pretend I've read all the stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote or seen every episode of Granada's terrific Sherlock Holmes TV show starring Jeremy Brett. I CAN however say that Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is no retelling but an interesting re-imagining (or reboot) of the character. This is apparant in the slam-bang action-packed opening (easily the best sequence in the film) where we see the Sherlock Holmes and the police rushing to save an innocent woman from being sacrificed by a mallicious cult. Holmes uses both his brains and his brawn to foil the cult's plans letting you know this is a more action-oriented Sherlock Holmes.

Robert Downey Jr is terrific as this new Holmes, a character that's always alert and always ten steps ahead of everyone else whether it be crime scene deduction or hand-to-hand combat but falls short when it comes to understanding people (or ANYTHING outside his own brilliant mind). Mark Strong is equally good as the villain Lord Blackwood, the powerful cult leader using ""black magic"" to gain influence over his followers. Jude Law is well cast as Dr Watson, Holmes' life-long companion as is Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade (the Commissioner Gordan to Holmes' Bruce Wayne). Rachael McAdams is miscast as Irene Adler. McAdams is a good actress but she seems so out-of-place with the rest of veteran actors of the film that I just didn't buy her as Holmes' intellectually flamboyant equal.

While the characters in this movie are great, I unfortunatly can't say the same for the screenplay. The story's interesting enough, but the dialogue these characters spout is so flat (and at times inconsistant with the time period) that it's hard to feel engaged by their relationships to one another. You just don't care enough about them. Guy Ritchie has been reknowned for his sharp dialogue in his terrific crime films so I'm not sure what happened here. Can he not convey anyone unless they're a foul-mouthed gangster?

Another thing that falls flat in this film are it's action scenes. The close-quarters hand-to-hand action is great (if redundant) but when the film switches to more open/grandious locations for it's action the movie gets lame. I don't think I've ever been so bored watching a character almost sawed in two, or watching a destructive fight in a harbor while the heroes almost get crushed by a boat. Again, this might've been different if I cared a bit more about Holmes and Watson and Adler, or maybe if Guy Ritchie had a bit more experience directing high-end action sequences but as it is I couldn't get into it.

A couple things this film did succeed in was it's set designs and music. Old-London looks and sounds so gritty you'll be almost sucked into it's grime (I also love the look of Holmes's office room). The music is also exceptionally well chosen to the point I sat through the entire credits just so I could hear the entire soundtrack.

While Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is lacking for the most part it does have some interesting ideas going for it. This is supposed to be the first in a trilogy, I just hope they spruce up the dialog (and control the action a bit) for the sequel.",1261872000,,3200,4.821493624772313
2047290,4,B0001Z3TS4,"I don't like the ego Robert Downey Jr. seems to have in most TV interviews, but I can't deny that the man can act his behind off. His Sherlock Holmes is funny, smart, tough and all while keeping a very good British accent. There is just some magic behind his eyes in every scene. His chemistry with Jude Laws's Watson is the closest thing on screen between two dudes since Brokeback Mountain. Okay, they don't get it on, but you can tell they have a love (not in that way) for each other that neither can really express. Jude Law more than holds his own and even manages to steal a few moments along the way. Most of the film's humor stems from the back and forth between Holmes and Watson. Rachel McAdams is okay, but she really isn't given that much to do. Mark Strong made for a decent, yet predictable villain.

My main gripes are with the story. There's nothing really new here and it is dragged on for about 15 minutes too long. I also had trouble keeping up with some of the dialogue that seemed to be either mumbled or covered up in a thick accent. I'll have to check this one out again with subtitles when it hits Blu-ray. I'm sure I missed a lot of jokes the first time around. Guy Ritchie's directing style has been poorly received by critics in regards to Sherlock Holmes, but I didn't find it too distracting. In fact, I normally can't stand his movies, but I really ended up enjoying this one. He adds just the right amount of darkness to the material and keeps his crazy editing cuts to a minumum.

Sherlock Holmes combines a little humor, lots of action and some better acting than one would expect in a movie like this. The ending is sequel friendly and I think this new version of this iconic detective will leave people wanting more.",1261785600,,1752,4.371165644171779
2047291,3,B0001Z3TS4,"From my wife Sarah: From watching the commercials and reading reviews I understood that this would be a more modern Sherlock Holmes, designed to entertain as most current action adventure movies do. I was fine with that. In fact, the commercials and previews looked funny, witty, exciting and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the movie fell very short of that. Unfortunately they used all of the best moments for the marketing campaign.

Ultimately it was only so-so. I think part of the problem was the pacing of the movie. It seemed to drag on without ever becoming really impactful. There were moments when something would happen and it seemed like it might start to get interesting, but then it would go back to dragging. We were just never pulled in for very long. There were a LOT of fight scenes, and while I enjoy a good fight scene, they seemed to just drag after a couple minutes. There were long scenes that didn't seem to add to the story.

Another issue we had was that there were many times when we could not understand the dialogue. I guess it was a combination of a lot of mumbling combined with the accents. Or perhaps it was a technical issue. I'm a very big fan of period movies and have no problem understanding that type of accent ordinarily. In fact, I loved Robert Downey Jr. in Restoration. That was a great movie and I understood everything he said. Jude Law is completely understandable in all of his movies. For some reason it was simply hard to make out what they were saying.

We are big fans of Robert Downey Jr., and so respect him as an actor. I've watched him over the years and I always hope his movies will be a success. Jude Law is also a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films tremendously. My guess is that the issues with this film are there because of the script and direction.

I'm sure there's more I could say, but ultimately this movie just didn't entertain us.

Parents should know that there black magic was a big part of the plot.",1261785600,3,1980,4.5195530726256985
2047292,4,B0001Z3TS4,"This marks my umpteenth Sherlock Holmes movie and my first Guy Ritchie film...Firstly, let me qualify Nobody can compare to the Jeremy Brett & Basil Rathbone's  portrayal of the film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective...with that out of the way... Few American actors have undertaken the part, fewer still with such success. Downey owns the part as does his Watson, played by Jude Law. The report between the two is easily worth the price of admission. The ineffectual Inspector Lestrade and the severe Mrs. Hudson are played straight, maybe a little too flatly. Another major inclusion from Doyle's original works is Irene Adler from ""Scandal in Bohemia"" the only villain to escape the Detective...Rachel McAdams plays a tweaked version of ""the Woman"" as Holmes considered her the embodiment of her sex, and the only thing that comes close to a love interest for the original character. There is a shadowy cameo by another major character created by Doyle...but that story is for another film...apparently. Doyle wrote 60 adventures starring his famous detective, that's 56 short stories & four novels, the film contains multiple nods to this material for Holmes fans.  Like many of these stories this film has another laying theme of the occult, as it was in interest of Doyle himself, this time a criminal Watson himself has decreed deceased turn up alive and finishing his murderous spree. Ritchie's high energy pacing may be unusual for a Holmes outing, but very satisfying, the fight sequences are a blur, but like some moments of discontinuous exposition revealed by Holmes himself retroactively...even in hand-to-hand scenes the audience is privy to Holmes' lighting intellect as he evaluates his opponents, the weaknesses then the consequences of his actions...then we see one of those blur of a fight sequences satisfyingly witnessing the outcome of Holmes internal deliberations. The same goes for other reveals, following Holmes' explanations, some unseen; others follow his quick-disguises and conclusions.

The movie begins with the apparent endgame of a case to be the last with Watson and Holmes as a team. Watson is preparing to wed his beloved Mary, only mentions in the stories, this time she not only has lines, but a meeting with Watson's best friend and 221B Baker Street sometimes roommate. Downey's Holmes has the brave brilliance of the character in the text and the mad genius of Jeremy Brett's BBC Holmes, and what he adds to the role is his sometimes shirtless, slovenly charming energy. Robert Downey Jr. executed a perfect tone and an equally perfect British accent. I'm happy to add Downey to the list of actors who've played Sherlock Holmes. May Ritchie and Downey continue towards the sequel  they have laid the groundwork for in this film.

Hans Zimmer's theme for the the great detective is as catchy as one John Williams might have created with what might be a harpsichord and violin. Other music choices are wise ones the inclusion of the Road to Dublin by the Dubliners in the boxing-brawl match is inspired...and I will be buying the soundtrack CD",1261785600,3,3103,5.064579256360078
