2732209,5,B000MGBLQO,"Two years ago Warners released ""The Doris Day Collection"" which quickly became a best seller.  It contained some choice Day films from the 50's and 60's and reacquainted a lot of people with the wide-ranging talents that Doris Day possesses. There was a reason she reigned as the top box-office female star in history, a title she holds to this day. Volume 2 contains 6 more reasons why Doris Day still has that unique ability to make audiences feel warm, content, happy, and very satisfied.

Included in this collection is Day's screen debut, 1948's ""Romance on the High Seas"".  It's a gorgeous technicolor treat - a throwback to an era when movies were designed to entertain and it succeeds gloriously.  Miss Day introduces the classic song, ""It's Magic"" and while not first-billed, steals the show from Jack Carson (the first of three successive teamings), Janis Paige, S.Z. Sakall and a great cast.  It's a case of mistaken identity, but what is most memorable is the ease with which Miss Day seems to acquit herself on film.  She's a natural - funny, real, and gorgeous. There's a bit of the late Betty Hutton in her performance but ultimately she proves herself to be one of a kind.

The rest of the titles each have their high points.  ""My Dream is Yours"" has lots of grit in this variation of ""A Star is Born"" with Day's star rising and for good reason. My favorite song is her heartfelt rendition of ""I'll String Along With You"" - flawless. Other highlights include a sequence in which she and Carson team with Bugs Bunny.

""I'll See You in My Dreams"" is the wonderful bio of lyricist Gus Kahn and contains a trunkload of classic tunes sung perfectly by Day, co-star Danny Thomas and Patrice Wymore in a knockout performance. It has much more grit than the typical biography and Miss Day is exceptionally good as Kahn's wife Grace. Michael Curtiz has directed the film in black and white which seems to make it more serious than many films of this mileau.

""On Moonlight Bay"" (1951) and it's sequel 1953's ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" are like a couple of Currier and Ives pictures brought to life. Warm-hearted and filled with a score of great tunes, they lovingly capture an era that might have been or at least was in memory. Miss Day, co-star Gordon MacRae and ""family"" - Leon Ames, Rosemary DeCamp, Billy Gray and Mary Wickes, seem like a family.  Loosely based on Tarkington's ""Penrod"" tales, it had critics carping that it wasn't ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" and it isn't.  On its own terms it is just as delightful filled with charm and genuine warmth, never forced and never trite.

The weakest link in the collection is probably ""Lucky Me"", the first technicolor musical and subject to critical pans at the time of its release.

Miss Day and a fine supporting cast including Bob Cummings, Nancy Walker, Phil Silvers, Eddie Foy Jr and Martha Hyer, give it their all.  The songs may not be memorable but they are energetically rendered and there are enough chuckles sprinkled throughout to keep the film going.

One will come away from this 12 hour marathon of Doris Day films feeling extremely good, exhilirated in fact, and possibly wishing that Hollywood still made the kind of feel-good movie that Doris specialized in during her 7 years at Warners. Feeling that way in this day and age is something not to be scoffed at. If someone could bottle that indefinable quality that Doris Day possesses and share it with the world, we'd all benefit.",1174262400,71,3463,4.680395387149917

2732211,5,B000MGBLQO,"If you've ever seen 'On Moonlight Bay' and 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' then you know that this set is complete with just those two films....in my opinion at least.

The same cast from 'Moonlight' returns again in 'Silvery Moon' and the ensemble are just so fun together that you'll wish they had made a third, forth, etc. in the series!

Mary Wickes, always a hoot, is the ornery sidekick/housecleaner/maid (as usual),

Billy Gray...is hilarious as Doris' little brother, with his wild/vivid imagination.

Gordon McCrea is Doris' love interest in both films.

Those are the standouts to me...but you should watch them and see what you like best.  If you enjoy light-hearted, clean, fun, family oriented films...both of these are for you!!

Just discovered that ""The West Point Story"" is also being released on April 24th as part of the ""James Cagney Signature Collection (Vol. 2)"" similar to the way ""Storm Warning"" and ""The Winning Team"" were released in last year's ""Ronald Reagan Signature Collection"".

2732282,5,B000MGBLQO,"This collection of movies is fabulous!!!  Each shows off how professional and talented Doris Day is and always was.
  ""Romance on the High Seas"" is such a light-hearted, feel good movie.  And, Doris Day and Jack Carson are so great together.  It's a must see from the start where she shows her comedic side and, of course, every song she sings is magic, just like the song, ""It's Magic"" that she sings in the movie.
  ""On Moonlight Bay"" and the sequel, ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" stars Ms. Day and Gordon MacRae...guess I'd like to say they are a match made in heaven.  Great cast in both movies and Doris Day is such a treasure to watch.  I never would have guessed ""On Moonlight Bay"" was her first movie. Ms. Day is such a natural actress.  I can't imagine anyone not liking either one of these movies.  It's a great story and the singing is superb!
  ""Lucky Me"" is a hoot besides Ms. Day, there is Robert Cummings, Phil Silvers, Eddie Foy, Jr. and Nancy Walker.  At the beginning, Doris Day sings a song about superstition that had me in stitches plus I had never heard the song before nor even knew about this movie.  Great performances! Great Movie!
  In ""My Dream Is Yours,"" Doris Day is a singer trying to make the big time, and Jack Carson is there to give her the help.  They work so well together and I loved the part where Bugs Bunny gets into the act and Day & Carson are in costume.
  ""I'll See You In My Dreams,"" well, I remembered this movie as a small child and just loved it.  Ms. Day and Danny Thomas are terrific.  The movie is based on the life of Gus Kahn and his wife.
  In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this fabulous collection of Doris Day movies!",1317600000,,1685,4.276190476190476
2732283,4,B000MGBLQO,"Good collection of Doris Day's movies. Have most of them on VHS,but the DVD collection is much better, picture wise.",1315872000,,116,4.85
2732284,5,B000MGBLQO,"These are not the best-known of Day's spangle of films. But look at Amazon's irresistible price- less than 5 bones each, and you know you love Doris Day. So like me, why not take a chance? Here are six feature films from 1948-1955, individually packaged in a box set. If there's one thing I learned from this set, it's that I think Michael Curtiz is a great director (he directed three of the films). It's difficult to believe that Doris made her screen debut in ""Romance on the High Seas"", as in this 1948 film she already seems such an old hand, and everything one loves in her later films is already evident. Leonard Maltin gives it three stars and calls it ""Engaging Fun"". The five stars I gave this set could stand for this film alone.

Next up is ""My Dream is Yours"" from 1949, which Maltin notes is a remake of ""Twenty Million Sweethearts"" from 1935. I say it's more of the good stuff. S.Z. Sakall, for one, is excellent. The much touted animation sequence with Bugs Bunny must have cost lots of time and money to make, but it seems out of place. Not that Bugs is out of place, but it comes so late that it seems the film ought to already have ended. By that time it's all over but the shouting--or kissing.

Third is ""On Moonlight Bay"" (1951) which Maltin calls a ""folksy musical"", and which was inspired by Booth Tarkington's ""Penrod"" stories. The stories may be lively, for all I know, but this film seems to me entirely sleepy, and neither Day nor Gordon McRae seem very convincing. Day is usually very good at being murcurial, or switching moods or styles at the drop of a hat. here it seems simply contradictory. McRae starts by grousing about songs with ""moon and June"" in them. What is the title song? He's very unconvincing as a collegiate with ""modern"" views against marriage. This, and the follow-up, also named for a Warner-held song, just seem like an excuse to build a film around the title. Look how much more spark Day would bring to ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" in which she also plays a naive teen, in 1957.

The director of the third film was Roy Del Ruth, who gave us ""Thanks a Million"" in 1935 (which Maltin really likes). This fourth film, still from the Penrod tales, is directed by David Butler. Whereas the third film takes place on the eve of WWI, and ends with McRae shipping off, promising to marry Day, the fourth film, ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"", begins with his return from the war, somehow being against marriage again. Maltin gives both these films two and a half stars, but in this one notes that (Leon) Ames is wonderful as the father"" (as he was in the previous film), and that (Mary) Wickes is delightful as the family maid"" (here reprising her role, and the only one with any witty or even sardonic lines). Everyone else seems miscast.

But my biggest gripe about both these films is their portrayl of the times, which later eras dismissed as straight-laced and naive. Nevertheless, especially for well-to-do families, life was extremely light-hearted and lively. It's the era of barbershop singing (of which there is none in either picture). Disney's ""The Happiest Millionaire"" takes place in the same time period and far better captures the happy-go-lucky tenor of the times, before WWI and the angst of the moderns, who for some reason feel a duty to worry. In Britain, P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and other stories take place also in this time period, and they are some of the funniest comedies of manners ever written.

The fifth, and only black and white film is ""Ill See You in My Dreams"" (1952), in which Danny Thomas plays songwriter Gus Kahn. Maltin pans it as ""musical biography at its hokiest; a trite telling of Gus Kahn's life and times"". It was a hit with moviegoers, however, and it's easy to see why: it's jammed with Warner Bros-owned songs that were then on the radio, and most of which are still known now. I don't know if Thomas' portrayl of Kahn is very accurate, but it's interesting anyway as a tale of the agony and ecstasy of a songwriter, with Day as a music publisher, boosting Thomas (Kahn) against all odds and believing in him no matter what. If it's a fairy tale, it's a good one.

The sixth and last film, ""Lucky Me"" (1955) Maltin doesn't like either, calling it a ""bright-faced but doggedly mediocre musical"". Perhaps so, but it's got everything I like in a film. Doris with a quirky personality--here she's superstitious--lots of opportunities for broad slapstick, thanks to Sgt. Bilko-- Phil Silvers; a great leading man in Robert Cummings, who is more ""Bob-like"" here than in his TV show, ""Love That Bob"". Great directing by Jack Donohue. Not overdone like some of the later big brash comedies like ""The Glass Bottom Boat"". This is also the only widescreen, letterbox format film in the set.

Then the extras. Movie matinees used to consist of a newsreel, cartoon, and the feature, and they're all here. The newsreels are theatrical shorts about the movies, mostly from the mid-'50s. They include: ""The Screen Director"", ""Let's Sing a Song About the Moonlight"", ""Let's Sing a Sing from the Movies"", ""When the Talkies Were Young"", ""The Grass is Always Greener"", and the best: three Joe McDoakes comedy shorts: ""So You Want to Be an Actor""; ""So You Want to Learn to Dance""; and ""So You Want a Television Set"". This last involves domestic unrest, and works some dramatic moments in a comic way--the same ground ""The Honeymooners"" would mine. The six restored Looney Tunes never looked better, and include: ""Sandy Claws"", ""A Hound for Trouble"", ""Lovelorn Leghorn"", ""A Ham in a Role"", ""I Taw a Putty Tat"", and the Oscar-nominated ""From A to Z-Z-Z-Z"". (Note: some of my dates for the films are a year different than that given by Maltin, as I went by the copyright date). To sum up what I think about getting this box set, I could do no better than to quote Doris Day: Lucky me.",1310601600,,5854,4.612284069097889

HOWEVER, I know Doris is beyond all of it, and is past caring about this part of her life, but wouldn't it have been nice to have a commentary on just one film? Even if old Doris couldn't have been enticed to do it, how about a film historian or recent biographer? The other extras are nice, but if I see just ONE MORE Joe McDoakes short I honestly think I'll scream (not too loudly, but loud enough).
I would advise getting all the Day movies while available. Who knows what the future holds? And although I love Day, I am puzzled why just about all her films (good, bad, indifferent) are available, when there are rather limited titles available for actress of the golden era that had broader range or were just as iconic in their way. Loretta Young comes to mind. Lana Turner is another. Despite that, this is a great set. I only wish that a commentary or two could've been included.",1250467200,,1013,4.365079365079365

I have been a fan of Doris Day since I was a young teenager going to the movies.  This Doris Day Collection Vol. 2 includes six of Doris Day's most tuneful musicals which she performed on the big screen.
Here in this DVD collection, Doris Day, with her lilting voice and charismatic acting is once again displayed in beautiful technicolor and black and white.
""Romance on the High Seas"", her first Musical, showcased her very popular hit song"" It's Magic"" and her leading man was Jack Carson. ""My Dream Is Yours"" she again co-starred with Jack Carson. ""On Moonlight Bay"" and ""By The Light of the Silvery Moon"" had Gordon Macrae as her leading man and both singing the old popular standards of the early vintage years.  ""I'll See You in My Dreams"", a Warner Bros., formula musical biography, which features Danny Thomas, tells the life and times of songwriter, Gus Kahn.  Several delightful songs are featured in this film.  Danny Thomas, is best remembered in the TV comedy ""Make Room For Daddy"". This film is the only one in glorious black and white.  ""Lucky Me"", one of Doris Day's later musical comedies, has two talented comedians, Nancy Walker and Phil Silvers, which I'm sure will have you laughing and this is shown in widescreen and glorious technicolor.
I remember Doris Day in the fifties plugging many song hits one after another which made her a rising, popular songstress on the hit parade.  Anyone who is familiar with Doris Day's personality will not be disappointed here, and this Doris Day Collection Vol. 2.  will certainly take you back to the good old days when musicals were so popular.  This Doris Day Collection Vol. 2, is just a few of Doris Day's most endearing musicals on DVD.  Her other volumes, 1 and 3 are also available which I intend to purchase in the near future.",1216684800,,2245,5.298591549295774

2732342,5,B000MGBLQO,"As Oscar Levant famously said ""I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin."" And indeed he did, appearing in her first movie ""Romance on the High Seas."" Of course, he was referring to the ""bedroom"" comedies she made after she left Warner's. ""Pillow Talk"" (1959) with Rock Hudson is still her most popular movie despite its inane plot.
Not that ""Romance on the High Seas,"" ""My Dream Is Yours,"" and the others in this collection aren't silly; they are.  But Doris SINGS in them, and that makes all the difference. They have an innocent charm, which ""Pillow Talk"" etc. don't with their adolescent take on s.e.x.
Doris sings some great songs: ""It's Magic"" in ""Romance..."" and the title song, ""It Had To Be You,"" ""Making Whoopee"" ""My Buddy,"" ""The One I Love Belongs To Somebody Else"" in ""I'll See You in My Dreams,"" the biography of lyricist Gus Kahn and the best in the collection.
Although not as good as those in Volume 1, all the movies in Volume 2 (except ""Lucky Me"" in which Doris doesn't sing enough to offest the bad plot) are very enjoyable, particularly if you like Doris Day the singer.

2732343,5,B000MGBLQO,"I enjoyed this item very much. I like Doris Day as a movie star and I've wanted to see young Doris Day's movies for a long time. But I live in Japan and can't get such things so far. Getting this item, I can enjoy watching her movies whenever I want to. This ""Doris Day Collection, Vol. 2"" has made my dream come true!",1193702400,,318,3.984375
2732344,2,B000MGBLQO,So far the best movie of the collection is Romance on the High Seas. The other two we watched are definitely not Doris Day's best performances. We have 3 more to watch so we'll see. I highly recommend Romance on the High Seas...it's funny and Doris Day is beautiful & adorable wrapped into one.,1190419200,,294,4.462962962962963
2732345,5,B000MGBLQO,"I liked/wanted all but one of the titles in this collection. So, for me, it was a great value. Quality is very good - best I've seen.

Only one not on my list of favorites was ""Lucky Me."" It was her first Cinemascope pix and a musical. So, to each his own.",1189987200,,256,3.923076923076923
2732366,5,B000MGBLQO,Doris Day movies brighten any day and these six movies are no different.  I enjoy watching them over and over again.  The singing is always lovely and the plots are never dull.  The extras on each dvd are fun to watch also.  I look forward to watching them with my kids when they are older.,1189728000,,290,4.218181818181818
2732367,5,B000MGBLQO,My 10 year old daughter has been a Doris Day fan for the past three years.  She absolutely loves Doris Day!!!!  I gave this collection to her for her birthday this year and she just loves it.  To give your child movies that are wholesome with such a talented actress.  She sings along to the movies when she watches them.  Great collection for Doris Day fans or anyone who loves the classics or just watching a great collection of movies.,1189641600,3,438,4.425
2732368,5,B000MGBLQO,"To add to all the previous reviews, this set really showcases the phenomenal talents of Doris Day. Each dvd in this set proves that she is one of the greatest talents of our time. What I'd like to emphasize here is the extraordinary job that Warner Home Video has done remastering each one of these films. The results are georgeus and totally flawless. It proves that when the right effort is made to do this task well, the results can be spectacular...I've never seen a better quality product!",1188086400,3,494,4.625
2732369,5,B000MGBLQO,"On Moonlight Bay and By the Light of the Silvery Moon are two of our favorite Doris Day movies, but I'm happy with the rest of them too. My Dream is Yours gets a little dragged out, but still fun. If you like the early Doris Day movies you can't go wrong with this set.",1186185600,,269,3.909090909090909
2732370,5,B000MGBLQO,"If you like musicals these are the movies to watch. I am a big Doris Day fan and she never disappoints me. If only they made movies like this now - wholesome, funny, music and something the entire family can watch together. Wonderful collection!!",1184976000,,246,4.613636363636363
2732371,5,B000MGBLQO,"Yeah, more Doris Day.  The first volume was great, this is just as great.  Now if anyone wonders why Day was such a huge star and so popular, one only has to watch these ""oldies but goodies"".  ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS is her debut film and she's already ""got it"".  She's a natural from the get go.  And that voice!!!  There will never be another like her.  Even if there were, she'd be out of luck because they don't make movies like these anymore.  Good thing she was born when she was. ON MOONLIGHT BAY and BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON are wonderful.  I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is really a Danny Thomas film, but Doris adds just the right kind of luster, and again, THAT VOICE!!  I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is a great vehicle for her as well.  Only LUCKY ME is a little lame, but it has Doris and OH THAT VOICE.  I just wish Warners would have subsituted TEA FOR TWO for LUCKY ME.  Regardless, get this volume.  Now if only the rest of her films were on DVD I'd be a happy camper.  That would be TEA FOR TWO; IT'S A GREAT FEELING; APRIL IN PARIS;TUNNEL OF LOVE; WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT; BALLAD OF JOSIE; MIDNIGHT LACE and JULIE.  Come on Warners and Universal let's get with it.  While STARLIFT is fun, Doris only has a cameo in it, but why not, let's have that one too!!",1183593600,,1292,4.083665338645418
2732372,5,B000MGBLQO,"For all Doris Day fans out there, this is a ""must add"" to your collections!  By the Light of the Silvery Moon and On Moonlight Bay are great musicals somewhat the same style as Meet Me in St. Louis.  I'll See You in My Dreams is a bit more serious, but very excellent.  My favorite is probably Romance on the High Seas, which is definitely a comedy!",1183593600,,349,4.17910447761194
2732373,4,B000MGBLQO,"THE DORIS DAY COLLECTION: VOLUME 2, from Warner Home Video, has six of Miss Day's earliest and most enjoyable musical romances.  Five were filmed in a square TV ratio, while the sixth is in CinemaScope.  And five are in brand-new Technicolor, while a sixth is in B&W.

ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS (1948)--Doris' feature film debut is in eye-blinding Technicolor and set on a Caribbean cruise with mistaken identity.  Georgia Garrett (Doris) poses as Mrs. Elvira Kent on the ship, while the real Elvira (Janis Paige) stays home to spy on her maybe philandering husband.  Georgia is wooed by Jack Carson, while Mr. Kent (Don DeFore) hires someone to spy on the real Elvira, who is presumably on the same ship but isn't.  Oscar Levant is wonderful.  Michael Curtiz directed a witty script by the Epstein Brothers and I.A.L. Diamond.  Cameos include Franklin Pangborn and Grady Sutton.  Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn songs include the classic ""It's Magic"".  It must have been a hit even in 1948 because it is sung three times.  This is an absolutely wonderful movie.  Bonuses include a theatrical trailer, a musical short, and a Tweety & Sylvester short.

MY DREAM IS YOURS (1949)--Michael Curtiz directs again and Jack Carson (Doug Blake) again is the romantic male lead for Doris as singer Martha Gibson.  When arrogant singing star Lee Bowman acts like a prima donna one too many times, Doug fires him and becomes agent to Martha, who becomes a popular and likeable radio singer.  Wonderful supporting cast of pros includes S. Z. Sakall, Eve Arden, and Adolphe Menjou, with cameos by Franklin Pangborn, Edgar Kennedy, and Bugs Bunny!  Harry Warren and Sammy Cahn songs include ""My Dream is Yours"" and ""Someone Like You.""  This is another brilliant Technicolor production.  Bonuses include an Oscar-nominated drama short, a Joe McDoakes comedy short, a classic cartoon, and a theatrical trailer.

I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS (1952) caught me off-guard because it is one of Doris Day's few B&W movies.  Still, it is photographed by Ted McCord, whose credits range from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1948) to THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965).  We have Danny Thomas as song writer Gus Kahn, who apparently wrote the lyrics to literally hundreds of popular songs in the first few decades of the 20th Century, several dozen with girl friend turned wife Grace (Doris).  Among the Kahn favorites are the title song, ""I Wish I Had a Girl,"" ""Love Me or Leave Me"" (which Doris would again sing in the 1955 biographical musical drama), ""Makin' Whoopee,"" ""Pretty Baby,"" and ""It Had to Be You.""  It's an engrossing and tuneful biography, again directed by Michael Curtiz.  The two stars are well matched.  DVD bonuses include an unusually insightful drama short called ""The Screen Director"", a hilarious Foghorn Leghorn cartoon, and the theatrical trailer.

ON MOONLIGHT BAY (1951) and its sequel, BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON (1952), are Technicolor gems about small town Indiana life on either side of World War One.  They are inspired by the ""Penrod"" stories of Booth Tarkington.  Doris Day and a very young Gordon MacRae star as a romantic couple; he spends two movies trying to decide if he wants to get married, which is wild because (1) Doris is a real sweetheart of a person even as a ""grease monkey"" and tomboy, and (2) he proposes and kisses her passionately in the street at the end of BAY.  Leon Ames plays her father, virtually the same role he played in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944); Rosemary DeCamp from YANKEE DOODLE DANDY (1942) is Mom; Billy Gray is Day's pesty kid brother; and Mary Wickes is the cook who never met a tray of food she liked.  The color is drop dead gorgeous; the directors are, respectively, Roy Del Ruth and David Butler, very competent craftsman filmmakers.  Songs in BAY include ""Cuddle Up a Little Closer,"" ""It's a Long Way to Tipperary"" and ""Pack Up Your Troubles."" and the title song as the film's finale.  Full-fledged musical numbers in SILVERY MOON include ""Ain't We Got Fun,"" ""King Chanticleer"", and the title song with ice skates on Miller's Pond.  Bonuses with BAY are a vintage sing-a-long short, a Technicolor cartoon, and the theatrical trailer.  SILVERY MOON bonuses include two wonderful Joe McDoakes comedy shorts, an Oscar-nominated cartoon, and the theatrical trailer.

One of Doris Day's first films in CinemaScope, LUCKY ME (1955) has her as a superstitious woman named Candy Williams.  The unluckiest day of Candy's life turns out to be the luckiest through twists of fate.  Also starring with Miss Day are Robert Cummings, Phil Silvers, Eddie Foy Jr. and Nancy Walker.  Bright musical numbers include ""High Hopes,"" ""I Speak to the Stars,"" ""I Wanna Sing Like an Angel,"" and half a dozen more.  It's a very cheerful and colorful Technicolor and wide-screen concoction with a remastered soundtrack.  Bonuses include the nostalgic short ""When the Talkies Were Young"", an Oscar-nominated cartoon, and the theatrical trailer.

There is also a Volume One, of course.  It includes such wonderful Doris Day musical classics as THE PAJAMA GAME, CALAMITY JANE, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME, BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO, PLEASE DON""T EAT THE DAISIES, and three more slightly lesser Day movies.  If you like the Doris Day movies in Volume Two, do check out Volume One.",1181865600,18,5269,4.892897406989854

2732404,5,B000MGBLQO,"I just received this box set and popped three of the titles in to see how they looked. I was astounded at the beautiful color and crystal clear picture, especially since the last time I saw Romance on the High Seas (on TCM last November) the color was faded and the image was dull. It's clear that a lot of hard work went in to the remastering of ""Romance"", ""My Dream is Yours"" and ""Lucky Me"", especially considering that ""Lucky"" is an early Cinemascope title, which usually means grainy images, but not here. I haven't looked at the other titles in the set yet, but I imagine that they are just as beautiful. I also love the cartoons and shorts, all released in the same year as the main feature. It's a ""Night at the Movies"" like Warner Home Video used to do in the '80's. The only thing I'd like to see in future releases is trailers for other films of the same period.
