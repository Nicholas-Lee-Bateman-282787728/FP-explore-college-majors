118972,5,079079568X,"I love this film.  To me the family dynamics and infighting are very real though acting in a theatrical manner.  The acting was right on the mark throughout the film with grand performances from everyone.  However, what grabbed my attention was Burl Ives.  He was amazing in the film.  Of course I have been a Burl Ives fan since I was a child in the 1960's for both his music and his narration of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  I highly recommend the film for anyone who is looking for something other than you typical quick edit action/thriller etc.  It's a character study.

Regarding the Blu-Ray, which is the page I am entering this review on, based on the disc reviews, I don't think I'll buy it until an updated version is release which I hope will be sometime in the next couple years.

Yes, Burl Ives rocks in this film.  You love him and you hate him!",1506643200,,863,4.439490445859873
118973,5,079079568X,Paul Newman's portrayal of Brick was a stellar performance. You really felt the intense emotions of his character. I looked forward to more of his character every scene of the film. Newman's character arc was splendid. I would recommend this movie to mature audiences that appreciate the sophisticated dramatization of this adaptation of a treasured literary classic. :-),1504224000,,371,5.413793103448276

118979,3,079079568X,"Review of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a story that people like to remake, but I don't really know why. In my opinion, its not Tennessee Williams masterpiece, and the supporting characters can get on the audiences nerves pretty quickly. The only reason I can imagine why everyone wants to take a crack at it is because the original is so beloved, other actors say to themselves, I want to be Elizabeth Taylor! or I want to be Paul Newman!

If youve never seen a Tennessee Williams story, heres the skinny: Its set in the South, a key plot point is a sexual problem, theres an old world family drama, a hint of male homosexuality, and its usually all during a very hot summer. Also, the movies are based off of plays, so there will be lots of monologues. Im not dissing Tennessee Williams; I actually love many of his plays. I just wanted to let you know what to expect.

In Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, a childless married couple is on the brink of divorce. They bicker and argue, all through the wifes familys visit. If youve heard of the characters Maggie the Cat or Big Daddy, they originate from this story. Obviously, with two beautiful people in the lead roles, this movie is enjoyable to watch, and the tension between them sparks off the screen. It might not end up being your favorite old movie, but its worth a viewing.",1499644800,,1372,4.310077519379845
118980,4,079079568X,Taylor and Newman of course. But let us not forget Big Daddy Burl Ives! What a powerful performance!,1497484800,,100,4.611111111111111

118994,5,079079568X,Cat On A Hot Tin Roof was released in 1958. It starred Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the cat. A fine Tennessee Williams drama of a southern family falling apart. Fans of Elizabeth Taylor will like this the most.,1486339200,,208,4.5
118995,1,079079568X,This movie completely altered the play and in doing so completely watered down its meaning and importance in Drama.  The cast was great however...such a waste!!,1486166400,,160,5.153846153846154

119004,3,079079568X,"I don't know why people are reviewing the movie with Elizabeth Taylor on this DVD. This is a filmed TV version...no Paul Newman or Taylor.  Jessica Lange is, in my opinion, not up to the task. She just doesn't own this part...not for lack of trying. But her mannerisms especially her spread hands, are just awful. Kim Stanley, IMO is a bit over-wrought in spots but otherwise, OK. Rip Torn is the best thing in this production...blustery, loud, holding court. Tommy Lee Jones...not the best part for him but it's kind of a difficult role; not much to do except in the middle of the second act. Penny Fuller as Mae is also good. All in all...just an OK version.",1483056000,,660,4.5

119018,4,079079568X,"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play about greed, sexual frustration, lust and impotence shaking up a wealthy Southern family. Elizabeth Taylor plays Maggie, the wife of  neurotic Brick Pollitt (Paul Newman), who seems to be uncertain about his sexuality. Made in 1958 during the era of the Production Code, the film was pretty steamy. The performances still hold up, particularly those of Burl Ives as Big Daddy Pollit and Madeleine Sherwood as the always pregnant Mae Pollitt. Taylor does a fine job, too, but her constant nagging tends to be grating after a while. Newman nearly blends into the sets with an extremely low-key performance.

Director Richard Brooks makes the location a humid, suffocating Louisiana mansion  a major ingredient. Placing so many disagreeable people with their own clashing agendas together in a claustrophobic setting cant help but generate dramatic fireworks.

Though the acting, especially toward the end when tempers flare and private resentments are aired, is often overwrought, the film is an excellent showcase for Taylor in her prime. She would subsequently win an Oscar for Butterfield 8, a movie she detested; many believe it was compensation for not having received the award for her flamboyant performance in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include commentary by biographer Donald Spoto, author of  The Kindness of Strangers: The Life of Tennessee Williams, making-of featurette, and theatrical trailer.",1476835200,2,1508,5.2625

119021,5,079079568X,"The story in by Tennessee Williams and if you like Tennessee Williams you will love this film, if you do not then be prepared for another depressing tale, but very bell presented. Having said that this is an excellent film based on the story by Tennessee Williams. It has remarkable actors and Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman really deliver their best. The secondary roles are also very well presented with an outstanding performance by the veteran Burl Ives. The film is very well directed by Richard Brooks. Coming now to the blu-ray version. The picture quality is amazing for a film of its time (1958). Both the sharpness and the colours are simply outstanding. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes good cinema.",1475971200,5,723,4.838709677419355

119032,5,079079568X,"This is one of my favorite movies of all times.  Elizabeth Taylor does a fantastic job playing the role of Maggie ""the cat"" Pollitt, a married woman who is doing her best to salvage her marriage that's on the rocks.  Brick (Paul Newman) is Maggie's alcoholic, depressed, former football star husband, who is doing his best to bottle up all his feelings after the suicide of his best friend - which he suspects his wife had a part in.

Big Daddy (Burl Ives) is Brick's no-nonsense, richer than dirt, demanding father who adores his daughter-in-law, Maggie.  He ""puts up with"" - and often shuns - his wife, Big Momma (Judith Anderson) their oldest son, Gooper (Jack Carson), Gooper's snotty wife, Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) and their herd of bratty, spoiled and undisciplined kids.

The whole family has gathered together at Big Daddy's house to celebrate his birthday, and everyone there has a side agenda.
Maggie: to win back her husband, protect him from the judgement of others, prove her innocence, and keep their marital problems a secret.
Brick: to drink enough to escape reality and avoid facing his problems.
Big Daddy: to try to ""fix"" his son, avoid the rest of his family, and enjoy life to the fullest after getting the all-clear from his doctor on a cancer diagnosis.
Big Momma: (similar to Maggie) she wants to deny the problems in her marriage, keep the peace with everyone, and win the approval of her husband.
Gooper: to win over his father in an attempt to take over the family business.
Mae: to constantly berate Maggie for not bearing any children with her husband, and (like Gooper) win over her in-laws for a piece of the pie.

This movie is a classic with amazing actors.",1472688000,7,1690,4.7312925170068025

119062,5,079079568X,"In 1958 Hollywood censorship restrictions were still sufficiently all-pervasive to necessitate a toning-down of Tennessee Williams's CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1955). Most of the homosexual themes were removed, and the third act revised to include a lengthy scene of reconciliation between Brick (Paul Newman) and Big Daddy (Burl Ives). Williams so disliked the toned-down film adaptation of his play that he told people in the queue, ""This movie will set the industry back 50 years. Go home!""

Despite the author's misgivings, the homosexual element is still very much evident in Richard Brooks's and James Poe's screenplay.  Brick is full of self-loathing in the belief that he has contributed to his close friend Skipper's death, and cannot stand Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) to be anywhere near him.  While the film shows Brick and Maggie coming together at the end in sexual congress, we still doubt whether it will be a success in light of Brick's previous behavior.  The film talks of a ""close friendship"" between himself and Brick in such open terms that we cannot help but doubt that there was a sexual element to it.

Even if we accept that the film slightly bowdlerizes the source-text, we are left with a work that hits viewers with the emotional kick of a mule.  Shot in garish color that brings out the sheer awfulness of the celebrations mounted for Big Daddy's birthday by Sister Woman (Madeleine Sherwood) and her overfed offspring, the film emphasizes just how much ""mendacity"" - or the perpetual telling of lies - has destroyed this family.  The action unfolds in a series of powerful scenes involving one or two characters - Maggie and Brick, Big Daddy and Brick - where they quite literally tear the emotional heart out of one another.  Brooks favors long takes interspersed with frequent close-ups portraying the mental as well as physical strain the characters undergo.

Yet perhaps this is inevitable in a traditional Southern world where child-rearing is accepted as inevitable and love takes second place to power.  Gooper (Jack Carson) is a successful lawyer, giving him the (totally unwarranted) belief that he has an automatic right to inherit Big Daddy's estate when Big Daddy passes.  In his slate-gray suit and slicked-back hair, he looks every inch the efficient executive as opposed to the slatternly Brick, who spends much of the first of the film in his pajamas, with a crutch to help him move around.

Big Momma (Judith Anderson), although sympathetic towards Brick, encourages such beliefs with her relentless quizzing of Maggie as to why Maggie has not yet produced a child.  In light of such pressures, it's hardly surprising that Brick should have begun a homosexual relationship as a means of escape, an alternative form of love based on passion rather than duty.

Newman and Taylor's exchanges are memorable; two actors at the cusp of mega-stardom taking advantages of Williams's brilliant writing to portray two characters victimized by their surroundings.  It's not their fault that they cannot consummate their relationship: circumstances dictated their destiny.  As Big Daddy, Ives is both imperious yet vulnerable, his body quite literally succumbing to cancer, even though is mind remains dominant.

Stylistically speaking this version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF might appear somewhat theatrical, with its claustrophobi-like settings and long takes.  Yet it retains the capacity to shock viewers with its stark rawness, even though it is nearly six decades since its original release.",1446336000,2,3524,5.141856392294221

119079,4,079079568X,"Over the weekend, I attended a production of Tennessee Williams' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"".  It was the opening production of a newly renovated theatre.  The play has been selling out the house and its run has been extended. It was gratifying to find a small company offer a serious masterwork such as ""Cat"" as its opening production.

I have long been an admirer of Williams.  Some months ago, I read John Lahr's recent biography and read or reread many of Williams' works, including ""Cat"", and viewed some of the many films based on them.  I hadn't seen the famous 1958 film of ""Cat"" and didn't watch it when I was rereading Williams.  But seeing the fine production of the play moved me to watch the film on Amazon Instant Video.

The film stars Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the Cat and Burl Ives as Big Daddy. Paul Newman has the other starring role as Brick. Ives and Madeline Sherwood, who plays Sister Woman, were part of the original 1955 Broadway production.

Ives, Taylor, and Newman offer excellent performances as does the rest of the cast. The scenery and the setting enhance the film.  Some of Williams' themes, including the need for love, facing death, loneliness, and the inevitable tendency of people and family members to misunderstand one another are well-presented. The film, however, lacks the power and emotional rawness of Williams' play. The problem does not lie simply in the film's muted references to homosexuality in the relationship between Brick and his friend Skipper. The references in the play itself are more suggestive than direct. Rather the film tones down emotions and passions and the inner life, including explicatives and sexual references. It tends to become a family drama.

In the play, Williams toned down the third act at the suggestion of Elia Kazan to provide an ending with a sense of hope.  For the rest of his life, Williams was conflicted about the ending. The play is almost always performed as Williams revised it, and rightly so.  But most texts of ""Cat"" include both the original and the revised third act.  The ending of the film, which includes a lengthy tear-jerking scene between Brick and Big Daddy goes far beyond anything in Williams' final version of the play. It is maudlin and unconvincing.  If it does not go as far as spoiling the movie, it weakens it and Williams' play substantially.

Film is a different medium than live drama or than reading. The film succeeds on its own term and offers the many people who have not seen a live production of ""Cat"" or read the play the opportunity to understand something of the play and of Williams. The film is also valuable for serious admirers of Williams to see. If it is not entirely faithful to the play, it offers an interpretation and insight into it while showing how as well how the play was received into mainstream culture at the time of the film. The film is worth watching but it is not the play. Those viewers who love the film may be encouraged to explore the text of Williams' play or to see it in a live production if they have not already done so.

119082,5,079079568X,"Tennessee Williams! So many great plays, classic by any standards. If I were to start listing my favorites I would never find a comfortable place to exit so, dear reader, I will spare you that, although the temptation is fighting my resolve.

Cat's qualities that do make IT so special are not unique among productions of TW plays, but many of the the details are unique. Start with the cast, anyone who has not seen Burl Ives perform a role so great as ""Big Daddy"" owes it to themselves to see this production, but there are many more gems in the productions.

Liz Taylor and Paul Newman do not need my accolades, they are stellar and both have solid history of revealing Tennessee Williams's characters to us.  In particular I suggest Suddenly Last Summer and Sweet Bird of Youth.

My little theatre group in Meridian Mississippi staged a production of Cat during my tour at the Naval Air Station there. Since I could not act but could speak in complete sentences they put me in the role of producer on the 3 productions that commenced after I found the group; The King and I was already on stage when I found the group. Our Cat was a major hit for the season, some would say the best but there were 3 other excellent productions - King, Don't Drink the Water and Star Spangled Girl.

Instead, you have a laughably over-wrought work in which not one single character seems remotely engaging or likeable.  The conversations are ponderous and without the wit and efficiency of ""Streetcar"".  This is one meandering, heavy-handed play.

.
The original Elia Kazan Broadway production of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF had 694 performances between 3/24/55 and 11/17/56. Opening night cast included Burl Ives as Big Daddy, Ben Gazzara as Brick and Barbara Bel Geddes as Maggie.

In the Richard Brooks film version, Ives is superb reprising his role of a wealthy Southern family patriarch. He's dying of cancer but, because of the ""mendacity"" all around him, is led to believe otherwise. Newman as his alcoholic ex-gridiron star younger son Brick is equally brilliant. Taylor has never looked better than she did for Maggie 'the Cat,' the unhappily childless wife of Brick.

Carter and Sherwood as older son 'Gooper' and wife Mae are brazenly after Big Daddy's estate and he knows it. They and an uncontrollable brood of ""no-necked monsters"" are barely tolerated by the old man, who keeps hoping that Brick and Maggie will deliver a worthy heir to his plantation kingdom. Highest recommendation!

119161,5,079079568X,"An unforgettable classic and one of the very best films of the 1950s! Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is yet another iconic Tennessee Williams play brought to the screen with a fantastic group of Hollywood's best involved. The on-screen spark between Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor as frustrated lovers is fantastic while Burl Ives steals the show with his all-in performance of a dying and discontent patriarch. The actors themselves are great, but the material, Tennessee Williams' brilliantly vivid characters, gave them plenty to work with. He was truly one of the best writers ever when it came to the subjects of lying, dark secrets, rocky relationships, and family rivalry. Richard Brooks captures the tone beautifully through his lighting, framing, and pacing of the scenes while the technicolor adds a layer of reality to the melodrama. Along with A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof set the standard for dramatic filmmaking and hasn't lost a bit of its potency throughout the years.",1402358400,,996,5.006024096385542
119162,5,079079568X,"the acting is fantastic as is the script. i'm not sure why we saw this but modern movies with top stars are mostly about f/x and are so mechanistically written and programmatic that there's no point watching them, except some independent flicks. even those lack the dynamic characters where the audience is lured into participating in probing the depths of the relations between the main characters as well as highly entertained by the word play and jokes. the movie bubbles with energy and is to use an ugly word multidimensional-comic-beautiful scrpt, great characters, plot, redemption, complexity of characters--that add up to a delightful two hours. most movies you can get swept away but then feel you have wasted your time. what has happened to movies? they're just money making programs which can't hand the paradoxical natures of ordinary huiman beings. sorry for the slight rant.",1402272000,,889,5.137931034482759

Both Taylor and Newman have so much sexual chemistry that they carry the surpressed sexual tension between themselves like the screen idols they are. This is a great work of ensemble acting, with Burl Ives as Big Daddy giving a superlative performance, as the dying plantation owner and head of a family fortune. Like most Tennessee Williams plays there are many undercurrents in this story.

Elizabeth Taylor lights up the screen in the first few minutes of this film by grinding a handful of soft vanilla ice cream into the face of a repulsive, no neck monster of a child who'd lobbed a lump of it her hitting her leg.  Delightful! She presents a magnificent performance.  Paul Newman, who hops his way through the film wearing mostly silk p.j., is, as he always was, penetratingly beautiful and alluring; a master of his art.  The two of them hiss and snarl at one another for about the first 1/3 of the play - and you can tell from the film that it is a stage play -  until Burl Ives takes the stage as Big Daddy and naturally becomes the axis around which revolve the other actors.  The casting is perfect and the acting stellar.

I saw this movie on TWC a few weeks ago and really understood with hopefully greater maturity a movie which was really special.  The acting was outstanding especially by Burl Ives and when you consider the majority of his career was spent as a singer it just gives you a greater appreciation of his performance.  This Tennessee Williams play did not delve into  could not delve as deeply into some of the controversial subject matter that was written in the play especially in the 50's.  We can barely talked about it today.  The crackling dialogue and absolutely witty and wicked performances of this ensemble cast makes up for any change or alterations in the original play.

119192,4,079079568X,"This is not a cut and dry good and evil morality tale.  Further, this perhaps one of the strongest pieces of character driven narrative in cinema history.  Based on the play of the same name, written and directed by Tennessee Williams, the film originally caught heat: first from being based of a Williams play, but also the topic issues of drug and alcohol abuse among the upper class of society, possible homosexuality, racial, gender, and southern cultural stereotypes; kitsch elements from the era.  Rather than detract from the experience, the critical layers that can be discovered in this film only enrich the experience further.

The plot of the film revolves around the concept of truth and its effects when revealed and when hidden.  As such, no single character is absolutely right: every character must go through, in some sense, some form of transformation.  These revolve around accepting truth for what it was and not what others claim, or speaking it when the outcome will lead to harm or tension.  As such, truth acts as the primary motivation through the film; it discovery and results of processing it acting as the moment making moments in the film.

Do not look for the good or rotten character in this film.  Everyone does something rotten and for a solid minute you will find a reason to distrust or dislike every character who crosses the screen.  This is, in my opinion, Liz Taylor's best role.  Even though I'm not an expert on the actress, I do know that the kind of stylized southern accent she sharply drawls with could only be done by her. Combined with her legendary beauty, she is nothing if not exciting.  Paul Newman's performance is beyond par; not only putting on an effective limp for the whole of the production, but also playing his aloofness to the point of harm.  Burl Ives, known more for his voice than his acting, portrays one of the great cinematic barons, drawn in part from characters like Charles Kane (certain references are even made directing the viewer to this notion).  He is powerful and capable of being powerless, the builders of empires and the broken man.

The cinematography and editing are for a generation with a longer attention span.  While not exploring Kubriekien levels of unbroken shots, most of the film occurs in single rooms, often dealing with two peoples conversations.  Nothing especially is done with set design, although wardrobe and make does a spectacular job of establishing the visual presence of each character.  With the somewhat limited cast (excluding children and servants), no one will forget who each character is.",1392508800,,2600,4.910755148741419

119271,5,079079568X,"This movie leaves out the homosexual/bisexual ""is he or is he not"" theme but substitutes something just as powerful in a fantastic movie.  I've seen the play several times and loved it...even it's ambiguous ending (will Brick or won't he?).  However this movie adaptation switches sections of dialogue around in a wonderful way, especially Big Daddy's Act 2 mention of his and Big Mamma's trips and her subsequent buying, that it gives the entire story a really uplifting feel.  I especially loved Jack Carson's Gooper and his acting towards the end (and the direction his character takes, so unlike the play).  Big Daddy's role in Act 3 is given so much more meaning with the movie's basement scene between Ives and Newman.  Every actor is fantastic.  Switching Mae's line about Maggie not having children to one of Mae's children is even more powerful.  I honestly thought I would dislike this film for laundering the plays content but the adaptaion is masterful.  My understanding is that Tenessee Williams did this adaptation and for him to re-envision his own work in such a successful way is truly a marvel.  While I love the true adaptation of the play with Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange, this one stands on its own and it stands high.  I was especially impressed with Paul Newman's Brick.

But actually, my problem was with the script.  And not just the bowdlerization of it.  It's the play itself.  I really don't think it's Williams' masterpiece.  For some reason it failed to move me.

Maybe it was because of the lengthy basement scene...maybe it was because of the Hayes Code...I don't know what it was, but for some reason the script was missing the thread of an idea.  I actually found myself losing interest (and I NEVER do that when Paul Newman is onscreen).

That said, the actors were lovely, the settings and wardrobe were to die for, and the On Demand playback was excellent.  Worth watching, but not a masterpiece.",1314576000,,814,4.590277777777778

119302,4,079079568X,"...make this movie better than the sum of its parts.  Newman, yet again, plays the sulking alcoholic, and I never did get around to liking him much even by the end when his character shifts.  There's something antiquated and 'Leave It to Beaver"" in his manner, in his inability to move past his days of sports star, and the endless 'cup to mouth' in the first half of the play (sorry, movie).  Basically, he comes off as a spoiled child, even pretty near up to the end and in the face of his father's impending death.  I felt it was a little ridiculous.  Also the lecture he gives his father about love being more important than money.  Sorry, money is only unimportant to those who have lots of it, and even then...  Granted both are necessary, but I just found most of his attitudes kind of childish, and as such found it difficult to a) sympathize with his character, or b) truly enjoy his performance.

On the other hand, Liz was certainly a dish, and I enjoyed the father giving old Brick a good tongue lashing in an effort to get down to the truth of what ailed him.

This movie is a product of its era (1958) though it does seem to reflect the kind of discontent that would lead on to more typical 60s themes. While those are apt to be as true today as they were then, the acting and attitudes of the characters are undeniably dated.  But then, you know to expect that when you watch a movie from 50 years ago.",1313366400,,1417,4.293233082706767

119312,5,079079568X,"That's a bit of a left-handed compliment. This movie, a hugely popular adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, has lots going for it - a star-making role for Paul Newman and a memorable turn for Elizabeth Taylor as well as Burl Ives repeating his stage role as Big Daddy. Yet it falls short of being the Williams classic as presented on the stage.

Now, put that fact -- it's not the play -- out of your mind and sit back and enjoy a wonderful cast spin a great story. If they censors had had their way, it would have been put off for filming for at least a decade more. The play was just too adult for the 1950s, when the movies were still being made for audiences of all ages and all sensibilities.

That was the problem facing writer-director Richard Brooks: how to film a story with a gay theme without the gay theme. As explained in the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), the Production Code censors at the time forbid ""sexual perversion"" (that meant gay) in American movies. Indeed, just why isn't Brick sleeping with Maggie the Cat?

Well, Brooks rewrote that aspect of the play. He made it a father-son issue rather than one of sexual identity. Sure, lots of people knew what was really going on when they went to the movie - the play had been a sensation - and they accepted the movie version for what it was: a typically watered-down Hollywood treatment of adult subject matter.

Tennessee Williams didn't like that and he didn't like Taylor, whom he thought was no actress. But Williams did like getting $500,000 for the movie rights and a share of the box office from one of the biggest hits in Hollywood history at that time.

Burl Ives won the Oscar for supporting actor that year - not for Big Daddy but for playing a similarly larger-than-life father figure in the William Wyler western ""The Big Country."" A frosty Friday, indeed.

A lover of classic movies, but denied the pleasure of viewing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, I eagerly awaited the film.  The movie did not disappoint!  Tennessee Williams was a brilliant playwright and the dialogue he brought to the play crackled with raw emotion and simmering anger.  Knowing a little about Williams I was ready for his southern landscapes, misogynistic undertones, and hidden homosexual tendencies.  Cat definitely brought all of these things, but would have been nothing without the staggering performances by Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Burl Ives, and Judith Anderson.  The film has a haunting and mysterious tone that stays with it throughout the whole film.  The actions and reactions of the main characters keep the audience riveted while the screen crackles with pent up sexual energy.  The cinematography was magnificent gibing the film it's southern twang.  This film has all the stamps necessary for a classic.  Like A Streetcar Named Desire before it, it continues to dig deep into the turbulent relationships between men and women and the frailty of the human spirit.

119324,5,079079568X,"What courage it must take to play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof!  The definitive performances of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman in the 1958 Richard Brooks film has to to be intimidating to most actors.  This reviewer had avoided, until recently, watching the 1998 re-make with Tommie Lee Jones and Jessica Lange.  Although Jones is a powerful actor who can deliver a convincing hard edge overlying tender sensitivity, he could not possibly play the wounded son Brick!  Well, don't delay watching this film!  What a happy surprise to see the interpretation Jones gives of Brick!  Jones may show us one of his best works on film in this movie.  And this 1998 film has the much-appreciated bonus and honesty of including Williams' more specific sexual revelations than was permitted in the 1958 film. Rip Torn is a special treat!  He is not Burl Ives as Big Daddy, but he is Rip Torn as Big Daddy.  This fine actor gives us an exemplary re-creation of Big Daddy.  How wonderful it is that we can be thrilled by both of these movies!  Neither takes anything away from the other.

119329,4,079079568X,"The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the review

Perhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights.  Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).

That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level, like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.

""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" is a prime example of the contradiction that a radical commentator is placed in. The themes of duplicity, latent homosexuality, adultery and  dysfunctional families topped off by more than enough mendacity to sink a ship are the stuff of social drama that NEED to be addressed as outcomes in the modern capitalist cultural sphere. However, in the end nothing really gets resolved truthfully here. Old 1950's-style All-American boy Brick, the `great white hope' of the family, may or may not sober up after the `lost' of his dear friend and fellow football player, Skipper. Saucy and sexy wife Maggie (the cat) may or may not really get pregnant by Brick and save the family heritage for him, or die trying. The only certainty, despite all that above-mentioned mendacity, is that Big Daddy is going to die and that 28,000 acres of the finest land in the Delta is going to need new management, either Brick, brother Goober (along with his scheming wife and their `lovely brood' of children) or some upstart. Off of these possible outcomes, however, I would not get too worked up about the final outcome.

In the movie version, done in the 1950's as well,  which starred the recently departed excellent actor Paul Newman as Brick and a fetching Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the question of Brick's possible homosexual relationship with Skipper is far more muted than in the play. The implicit question seems to concern Brick's fading youth, his search for perfect meaning to life in Mississippi and that one's existential crisis can be eliminated by reliance on the bottle.  The relationship between the dying Big Daddy and his ever suffering wife, Big Mama, is less dastardly than in the play as well. The scheming Goober and wife and family and those `lovely' children, however, run true to form. My sense of the movie, unlike the deeper issues of the play, is that a few therapy sessions would put old Brick back on the right track. The play was far less hopeful in that regard.",1231113600,,3730,4.937799043062201
119330,5,079079568X,"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof showcases the magnificent talents of Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor; and look for Burl Ives to do a stunning performance as well. The plot moves along at a good pace and the cinematography is excellent. This is a movie with guts to it and it should be mandatory viewing for people who view film as a true art form!

When the action starts, a rather wealthy Southern family gathers ostensibly to celebrate the 65th birthday of its patriarch, Big Daddy Pollitt (Burl Ives). However, the real reason for the large family turnout is soon made very clear: Big Daddy is dying from cancer and the members of the family want to get control of his estate even before he dies. Big Daddy's son Brick (Paul Newman), an ex-football player who indulges is large dosages of self-pity and anger tantrums, plays Big Daddy's son. Big Daddy's other son, Cooper 'Gooper' Pollitt (Jack Carson) arrives at the ""festivities"" with papers drawn up to make sure he gets Big Daddy's estate instead of Brick and Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).

Tensions are high from the very beginning. Brick's marriage to Maggie is clearly on the rocks; he shuns her and treats her rather cruelly. There are numerous vague inferences to the possibility that Brick's ""friendship"" with his late friend ""Skipper"" might have been of a romantic nature; and therefore Brick might not want Maggie simply because he doesn't like women. However, that is left to the viewer's imagination because at the time men being more than friends was in violation of the Hayes Code. In addition, Gooper and his wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have enough kids to form an army and they are desperate to make sure that they, and not Brick and Maggie, inherit Big Daddy's fortune.

Questions arise almost from the start. Will Brick and Maggie ever be able to rescue their marriage--and will Brick and Big Daddy ever make peace, too? What about the fact that the family and the family doctor hiding from Big Daddy that he has terminal cancer--how will Big Daddy take this when he finds out? Will this influence Big Daddy to give his entire estate to one or the other of his two sons? Watch the film and find out answers to this and other questions!

The DVD comes with two extras of note: There is a roughly ten minute retrospective about the making of the film. It was very challenging for Elizabeth Taylor to do the film because they started shooting just before her husband Mike Todd died in a plane crash. I especially liked the comments made by Madeleine Sherwood; she brings extra light to the retrospective that the historians cannot give because she was on the set with Elizabeth Taylor and they were not. The second bonus is a commentary by Tennessee Williams historian Donald Spoto.

Cat On A Hot Tin Roof deserves to be an Amazon.com ""essential video."" This film features superb acting from Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman when they were still relatively early on in their careers. I highly recommend this film for fans of these actors and people who enjoy classic motion picture will cherish this DVD for years to come.",1230768000,,3095,4.73469387755102
119331,5,079079568X,I ordered this shortly after Paul Newman's death.  He was so georgous as was Elizabeth Taylor.  This is a great Southern story with characters you wouldn't believe could exist unless you're from the South. I know some of these people!,1229904000,,234,4.825
119332,5,079079568X,Anyone who has no desire to watch two of America's finest actors at the height of their physical beauty is nothing more than a 'no neck monster.',1229385600,,145,4.407407407407407
119333,5,079079568X,"Reviewing `The Hustler' brought to mind the fact that I have as of yet to review `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and so I decided to go ahead and get this ball rolling.  As I mentioned with `The Hustler', what impresses me most about the actor that was Paul Newman was his ability to compliment and support all of his co-stars.  Sure, he was a force and an immediate attention grabber, but instead of being greedy for the limelight he always allowed his co-stars to soak up his natural charm and charisma.  This paid off in spades, for the performances given by (especially) his leading ladies is almost always best in show.

In other words; Elizabeth Taylor is beyond marvelous in this movie.

The film tells the story of a very wealthy family, or at least a very wealthy patriarch named Harvey Pollitt, affectionately known as `Big Daddy'.  It becomes known to Harvey's sons that he is close to death and so his boys Cooper and Brick make their way to their father's estate to celebrate his birthday and quarrel over his estate.  Brick is a washed up football player who has drowned his sorrows in alcoholic and resorted to resenting his wife Maggie.  Cooper is the responsible yet resentful son; the one who always tried the hardest yet fell short of daddy's expectations.  His nagging wife Mae Flynn is determined to win over Big Daddy's heart and his money.

When word is given that Big Daddy may not be dying after all this causes a big stir in the family as tensions mount and Big Daddy himself decides to weigh in heavy on his two sons, their wives and their `issues'.

`Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (a saying that refers to the predicament Maggie feels she has found herself) is taken from a stage play, and that may be my one and only complaint with this film.  At times it carries a stiffness that only seems to come from stage-to-screen adaptations.  It is minute and sparse, but to say it isn't there would be a bold-faced-lie.  It doesn't take away much from the film, and it is not really worth mentioning, but I feel compelled to at least bring it out.

There is so much good here that the one sore spot becomes forgettable.  The script is wonderful, truly engaging and deeply sincere.  The development of relationships, especially between Maggie and Brick, is flawlessly crafted.  Cooper and Mae Flynn feel like slight clichs, I have to be honest, but they help add layers to Brick, Maggie and even Big Daddy.  There are few films that really grapple the realities of marriage with such blunt honesty, but the relationship between Brick and Maggie (""we occupy the same cage"") is so pure I felt such a deep connection.  The film broaches much more than marital relationships but approaches the subject of fatherly affection with candor and honesty.  As Brick breaks down towards the end of the film we can see how the relationship between father and son is much more important than some give heed to.

The performances by the entire cast really raise the bar here as well.  Newman and Ives are magnetic as they spar with one another, but it is Elizabeth Taylor who just dominates this film from start to finish.  Her vulnerability and unwavering devotion is just effortlessly captivating.  You bleed for her character and strive for her to find her happiness, one way or another.

Richard Brooks (who also directed the gloomier yet equally impressive `In Cold Blood') delivers a fantastic film that is very well crafted and marvelously fleshed out, giving the audience much to appreciate and adore.  If you are looking for a tense family drama then look no further, for there are few as rewarding as this one.",1228694400,5,3611,4.627943485086342

  Nevertheless, it was Paul Newman's performance that stuck with me over the years, the mushy clay that became a brick. The openning scene in which the nostalgic fool broke his leg on the high hurdles made a lasting impression. Somehow, that was me. The fast talk and the angry, penetrating looks projected the image I wanted to imitate but never could. The hansome cripple, without a shirt, swinging on the bannisters, while shouting the blistering truth to the dumb founded family below, isn't that way we would all like to think of ourselves? Then, descending to the basement with his father, he becomes the true son. He loves the old man, while brushing aside the junk, collected over a life time.

This is a classic!
We were not disappointed - our memories had not distorted the impact of the original screenplay and performances. The relevance and contemporary nature of the themes is enduring, and generates plenty of discussion and debate.

119343,5,079079568X,"Paul Newman was a true classic. In the old days, leading men were like old cars: dependable. Paul Newman did a lot of films, but Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a personal favorite of mine.

The movie opens at a wealthy plantation in Mississippi. There's a big celebration; Harvey ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt returns home to celebrate his 65th birthday. His son Brick (Paul Newman) is married to Margaret ""Maggie the Cat"" Pollitt (Elizabeth Taylor). Brick was once a college football star before he tore a leg muscle. Now, all he has are memories, a busted ankle, a drinking habit, and a crutch.

Big daddy (Burl Ives) is a big man with a ravenous appetite for food, pleasure, and fat cigars. He built up his wealth the hard way. Every scrap on his dinner table was raised on his land. He took a swamp and turned it into a pasture. But now he needs to see his son Brick. They don't speak to each other. And Big Daddy can't understand why Brick and his gorgeous wife, Margaret, don't have any kids. They've been married for three years. Margaret's a firm shapely woman and Big Daddy's not shy about his feelings. If he had been married to Margaret for three years, she'd have three kids already plus one in the oven.

Brick sulks in his room all day. He won't celebrate with the rest of the family; he won't break his neck like everybody else to see Big Daddy. He rejects Margaret's advances. They have an arrangement--she sleeps on the bed, and he sleeps on the sofa.  He doesn't want anything to do with anybody. He has his coke and bourbon to keep him company. And he has his crutch to lean on.

Lately, Big Daddy's been a bit under the weather. The family doctor told Big Daddy that he was OK; actually, Big Daddy is dying. But before he dies he will straighten out Brick. They need to get things out in the open. With death imminent, Big Daddy's passions have turned in a different direction: pleasure and making up with his son, Brick. They have a showdown. Big Daddy snatches away Brick's crutch: lies. Past lies. The lies he drowns in alcohol. An ex teammate named Skipper was the only person Brick believed in. Brick thought he could trust Skipper with anything in the world...Brick was wrong.

Richard Brooks (Key Largo, Brute Force) adapted this 1958 film from Tennessee William's play. Burl Ives holds his own with Newman. Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely delicious. See this movie.

119360,4,079079568X,"In ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" Newman is an ex-football player, trying to relive his college athletic glories... Drinking and staggering, he attempts to jump hurdles, resulting in a painful injury that has him hobbling around on crutches during most of the film...

The role was certainly another demonstration of his widening range, for Brick is in many ways the antithesis of Ben Quick (""The Long, Hot Summer""). Although he too is cynical, cold and guilt-ridden, he manifests it by becoming moody, withdrawn, introverted... In addition, whereas Ben was strong and decisive, causing and participating in events, Brick is weak and passive, largely reacting to events around him... And he's anything but ambitious: while his greedy brother and sister-in-law await Big Daddy's death so they can inherit his huge fortune and plantation, and while his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) urges him to fight for his share, he merely broods and drinks... An emotionally crippled, ""thirty-year-old boy,"" he refuses to face responsibility and truth, preferring to drown his memories in liquor...

Newman and Taylor enact striking contrasts in temperament: she is fiery, loud, animated, sensual; he is cold, quiet, immobile, dispassionate... Brick and Maggie haven't been sleeping together, and she wants him desperately, but he keeps rejecting her advances... As she talks, he replies with sarcasm, contempt and mostly indifference, speaking in a dreamy, monotonous manner, as if only half-there...

In conversations with her, as with Big Daddy (Burl Ives), he stares into space, or walks away (usually toward the liquor supply), turning his back on the other party and forcing the dialog to take place on separate planes... All of this places him in a private world, where he hides his torment and anxiety beneath a mask of detachment...

If Newman is best at enacting Brick's unspoken thoughts and emotions, he's also effective in the more spirited moments, as when he screams at Maggie or Big Daddy, to prevent them from getting at the truth he wants kept buried... But exactly what the ""truth"" is remains unclear...

In the play, Brick's fear of admitting a homosexual attachment led indirectly to his friend's death and explained his overall moodiness and passivity... But because of Hollywood's moral code, director-scriptwriter Richard Brooks had to eliminate this, and the character's motivations are considerably weakened... His hostility toward Maggie--understandable in the play--is especially confusing because it results from events that are unconvincingly outlined...

With the homosexuality cut out, Brick's dependence upon his friend is now explained by the failure of Big Daddy to provide strength and love, and this changed emphasis does make for exciting drama... The film's key scene--not in the play--is one in which Brick confronts his father with this painful truth... As they sit in a cellar disarranged with the old man's useless antiques, he tells Big Daddy that love cannot be bought... Newman moves powerfully from anguished looks to an eruption of emotion, smashing everything in sight, finally breaking down and crying: ""All I wanted was a father, not a boss ... I wanted you to love me."" Both are in pain--Big Daddy because of cancer, Brick because his crutch has (symbolically) been broken, and they need each other's he1p to get upstairs... Therefore the film ultimately becomes another statement of father-son alienation, and their coming to terms with it, as in ""The Rack"" and ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" leads the characters to a new strength (and an upbeat ending not in the play).

Despite its compromises, the film was still daring by 1958 standards, and was an enormous commercial success... It received six Oscar nominations, including one for Newman as Best Actor--his first. Newman had developed, at last, a really impressive acting ability, and a distinctive screen image...",1166745600,27,3904,5.287096774193548

There are moments when they seem to be discussing something benign like where to go on vacation instead of the life and death issues they are facing in William's classic. Cast fatigue?

119366,4,079079568X,"This screen version of Tennessee Williams' play CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF was quite a success upon its release in 1958, earning Academy Award nominations for both Elizabeth Taylor (Maggie) and Paul Newman (Brick). Maggie and Brick are childless-- sleeping together was a requirement in those days for children to be conceived; these two do not do that anymore. Brick spends most of his time drinking while Maggie pleads for him to stop, to love her, to bed her, etc. Big Daddy (Burl Ives), who is worth about ten million dollars, at 65 is dying with cancer. His other son and daughter-in-law have reproduced themselves five times (""no-necked monsters"" according to Maggie)and have another in the oven. If Brick is to inherit some of his father's money, he needs to be both sober and a father. He and Maggie are pitted against his brother and wife. Additionally there is his relationship with his father or lack thereof. Although the word wasn't catchy in 1958, there's obviously more than enough dysfunctionality to go around here.

There is also an elephant in the room bigger than Big Daddy: what really was going on between Brick and his best friend Skipper who committed suicide for unknown reasons. This adaptation of the Williams play doesn't make much sense as to their relationship. They were friends, Brick only started drinking upon Skipper's death, and now won't sleep with Maggie. Since Ms. Taylor as Maggie was at the height of her incomparable beauty in 1958, that Brick does not find her sexually attractive is difficult to comprehend, given what the audience is told. The irony of all of this is that much is made about dishonesty (""mendacity"") throughout the film. Certainly the writer here is less than forthright about what really went on between Skipper and Brick.

Mr. Williams it is said did not like this film at all. He wrote the screen play for a later version that spells out that Skipper and Brick were in love with each other but that Brick rejected such a relationship, and Skipper then committed suicide. The plot at last makes sense.

This version suffers from too much talk-- often loud talk; additionally the no-neck monsters are little more than caricatures of children. The film is saved, however, with the acting of Newman, Taylor and Ives, particularly Mr. Newman. It is also interesting to see how far movies have come in almost 50 years as to what can be discussed frankly by writers.",1154390400,13,2419,4.824096385542169

119368,5,079079568X,"Though Elia Kazan's A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE ranks as the greatest screen adaptation of Tennesee Williams' plays, CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF follows closely behind.  Like STREETCAR, CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is filled with tension, much of which arouses from the harrowing confrontations between Brick (Paul Newman) and Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).  Brick, once a great football player, is now an alcoholic.  He hangs around in his room at his family's home, refusing wife Maggie's consolation and pleas for Brick to love her again.  Brick believes that Maggie slept with Brick's best friend; when she tries to bring up the subject, Brick will hear nothing of it.  When Brick is reunited with his father, Big Daddy (Burl Ives), who is dying of cancer, he finds himself forced to confront the truths of his life while forcing his father to confront the truths of his.

As I haven't read the original stageplay, I can't vouch for this adaptation's faithfulness to the source material.  I know that Williams himself despised this adaptation to the point of urging audiences not to see it.  Despite that, Richard Brooks' CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF has gone on to become a classic, thanks largely to outstanding performances from Newman, Taylor, and Ives.  Despite Newman's cruel attitude toward Taylor, we never really think of him a jerk, perhaps because the film makes the point very early on of showing that there's still good within him after Newman's arms automatically rise up to hold Taylor before his rage takes hold of him once more.  Taylor looks more beautiful than anyone in cinematic history.  Ives' gruff performance as ""Big Daddy"" is delightful, particularly toward the end of the film.  All in all, the cast is terrific.

Due to a musicians' union strike, there is no original score in the film, only a few bits of library music.  The strike turned out to be a good thing, as the lack of music makes the more tense scenes even more powerful.  The director, Richard Brooks, does a spectacular job, comparable even to Elia Kazan's superb work on his adaptation of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.  To top it all off there's excellent color cinematography by William Daniels and taut editing by Ferris Webster.

CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is another stellar Tennesee Williams adaptation and one of the finest and most tense dramas in movie history.  If you consider yourself a movie buff it's essential viewing, and even if you're not I would highly recommend it.",1153526400,11,2444,4.80622009569378

They are supported by an equally talented cast; I particularly enjoyed Madeline Sherwood as Sister-Woman, the strident, manipulative matriarch of an ever-expanding brood of ""no-neck monsters"".

Purists will note that changes were made to the script to make the movie palatable to movie audiences of the time and to conform to the Hollywood Production Code.

The director, actors and everyone else involved in this production have nothing to be embarrassed about for this is a fine movie indeed. In fairness to the Taylor-Newman movie, because of the censorship of that repressed era, the plot does not make a lot of sense. These actors though have the advantage of working with a story that Mr. Williams had revised so that the relationship that Brick and Skipper had that keeps interfering with Brick's marriage with Maggie now makes sense. (""A pure and true thing is not normal."") Additionally Taylor and Newman are so incredibly attractive that sometimes their good looks get in the way of their acting. Here we have really stellar performances by Jessica Lange as Maggie, Tommy Lee Jones as Brick-- he's a lot better than many of the critics say-- Rip Torn as Big Daddy and Kim Stanley as Big Momma. Tommy Lee Jones does some terrific acting with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. Jessica Lange continues to demonstrate that she is one of the best actresses of her generation. She gives a beautifully nuanced performance, expressing a wide range of emotions and can go from a vulnerable, lovable kitten to a clawing cat at the turn of a fan. The scenes between Big Daddy and Brick, through excruciating, are very moving.

Few films date as badly as this one. Nor do many from that decade illustrate its afflictions more vividly than Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Pitched about 10 decibels too high so that the audience can confuse loud talk with superior acting, the result is more  annoying than thought-provoking or even, perish the thought, entertaining. For a screenplay that prides itself on honesty, what could be more ""mendacious"" than excising playwrite Williams' homosexual theme from the endless palaver, leaving the audience of that day and this pondering just what is Brick's problem. This is two hours of sound and fury that finally boils down to the tritest of messages-- boys need fatherly love. And how transparent are several of the characters, especially the luckless no-neck clan who make even a Gene Autry B-Western  appear sophisticated by comparison. Only Newman manages to come through with professional dignity intact. To think that a slew of Academy Award nominations went to this overheated gab fest proves once again that the awards are more about investments than artistic invention.

Of course, there were exceptions: Billy Wilder left behind his sarcastic irony with Sunset Boulevard in 1950  and decided to smile with Stalag 17 and Someone like it hot (curiously The Best Comedy in the Century), but Stanley Kramer, Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan , Samuel Fuller, Nicholas Ray and Richard Brooks were the most relevant social scalpels of the society along that dark decade.

Superb, complex and mature existential conflict around a woman who wants to be loved and her extremely heat and soul wounded husband, whose inner demons have him struggled swimming in alcohol; add to this hell the familiar pressure. Burl Ives gives an outstanding performance featuring the father in law of the grieved Miss Taylor.

Burl Ives is magnificent as self made multi millionaire and patriarch of a Southern plantation empire, ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt.  He has just returned home from a medical clinic where although he doesn't yet know it, is dying from terminal cancer.  His family, except for mom Ida, aware of the prognosis has descended on the palatial family mansion to celebrate Big Daddy's 65th and ostensibly final birthday.

Paul Newman, the youngest son Brick, is an alcoholic ex football star and sports announcer.  He and his wife Maggie, ""the Cat"" played by a ravishing Elizabeth Taylor make a stunning couple.  Newman however detests his wife and rejects her sexuality believing her to have had an affair with his best friend Skipper.  Feeling himself to be a failure, he drowns away his sorrow with a bottle.
He is filled with guilt as a result of the suicide of his friend and fellow footballer Skipper, refusing to come to his aid.  Both Newman and Taylor were deservedly nominated for Oscars for their portrayals.  Although Ives was equally deserving, he nonetheless won an Oscar that year for his role in ""The Big Country"".

The dim witted eldest son Gooper played by Jack Carson and his loudmouthed porcine wife Mae played by Madeleine Sherwood have arrived with five obnoxious kids in tow, to carve up the Pollitt empire upon Big Daddy's demise.  They all must break the bad news to the airheaded ""Big Momma"" Ida played nicely by Judith Anderson.

Newman, the son favored by Ives, has never gotten along with his father.  Ives, while an excellent provider has always relished in his role as the boss, never showing love to his family.  This has been all the sensitive Newman has ever craved.  In a poignant scene in the basement of the mansion, father and son are finally able to talk and reveal their innermost feelings.  Despite the revelation of Ives' doom both father and son gain new insight into each other and begin to forge a relationship anew.  Newman also rekindles affection for his attention starved wife Maggie.

They were certainly beautiful, especially Taylor who in this film is reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe's radiant beauty in The Seven Year Itch.

Their acting was not bad. In fact, it was excellent. I liked the characters and I related to them.

The problem was the script. I had seen A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams before I saw this film. I had not liked that one either. The problem with his stories is that nothing too exciting ever happens. The scripts are just character analysises. The movie is simply a random succession of events that are not exciting enough to keep one's attention for an hour and forty-eight minutes.

Maggie loves Brick deeply and won't give up on him as he has given up on himself.  She fights to the bitter end of the entangled mendacities of the whole family.  Big Daddy (Ives) owns a 28,000 acre ranch and lives with his wife Big Mama, his other son Gooper, Gooper's wife Sue, and their four children, and has returned to the ranch to celebrate his 65th birthday with the news that he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  However, it is not revealed to Big Daddy of his future until a confrontation with Brick occurs.  The technicolor film will leave you wondering if it was all a mendacity or just a cat on a hot tin roof that won't get off.  At the time this movie was released in 1958, it would have received a five star rating.  However, in today's society and the treatment of the ladies in the the film, I rated it three stars.  This film received six academy award nominations for Best Actor; Best Actress; Best Picture; Best Director; Screenplay Adaption; and Cinematography.",1090972800,,1525,4.639405204460966

  Every character has three dimensions, and every line is perfectly written and delivered. Credit is needed for the original playright(although I am aware the plot was altered to please the strict critics of the time), who along with the screenplay writers are as important as the actors.
  Speaking of actors, Liz Taylor, Burl Ives and Paul Newman were all flawless in their roles. They were human, and as a painting they were more real than reality. My opinions of the characters changed continually throughout the film. It was as if you were peeling away the skin layer by layer to find the truth. Annoyance turned into hate, hate turned into compassion.
  The most important element of this film was feelings;emotions the players have, and have to deal with. As well as how you feel about them, and their situations.",1086998400,5,904,4.837662337662338

 Has so much tension, one can't cut it with a machete... Just another very dysfunctional family, which Tennessee Williams writes so brilliantly.
You have Maggie (the cat) The only character in the extended family who is 'Normal' The only one who seems to be keeping the family from killing one another.  Liz, of course plays her beautifully, superbly, very sexy as 'The Cat'
(Brick) Paul Newman plays her husband...A drunk with many devils he needs to let out, such as why he will not sleep with Maggie, why won't he stop thinking about his foot-ball buddy who killed himself.  The viewer will wonder if his has other preferences... Because who wouldn't sleep with (The Cat)??
Big Daddy...played by Burl Ives... The GOD of the family, the one with all the money, Power, the one who's dying. (Excellent performance)
(Goober)  Brick's brother and his wife wait impatiently for Big Daddy's fortune. The wife is appalling enough to make one sick.  Continually taunting Maggie about not having children, having a bad marriage, not controlling Brick.  Her kids run around the house like little, foul animals.
This family is a disaster waiting to happen...The pressure cooker is on high, baby, and when she blows
Watch out...All hell will break loose all over the place.
They don't make um' like this anymore.

119391,3,079079568X,"It's a curious thing that Hollywood often tackled subject matter that it was forbidden to show on the screen.  The net result - a good many stage plays often had more than a bit of doctoring going on before making it to the big screen. ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" is no exception.  The original story concerns itself with Brick's homosexuality and his resulting inability to find his lovely wife even remotely attractive - at least enough to impregnate her with an heir to his father's plantation fortune.  However, homosexuality was a big NO, NO in the movies.  So instead we get Brick (Paul Newman) as a sexually frigid prig who thinks that his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) has been having an affair with his best friend, Skipper (whom we never see).  Thus the balance of power and the resulting confusions which are straightened out in the end don't seem to make much sense.  Nevertheless, ""Cat"" is a compelling piece of 50's kitsch.  Richard Brooks ably directs what's left of the plot and the relationship that he fleshes out between Big Daddy (Burl Ives) and Brick is genuinely touching. Dame Judith Anderson gives a poignant and heartbreaking performance as Big Daddy's dopey wife.
TRANSFER: YUCK! Colors are weak and not well balanced.  Flesh tones are often jaundice. There's a decidedly green tint to most indoor scenes and an overly blue tint to outdoor scenes.  Age related artifacts are everywhere! Contrast and black levels are fairly accurate, though a few darker scenes appear to be suffering from less than 'black' blacks. Edge enhancement rears its ugly head now and then and is somewhat distracting.  The audio is MONO but nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: FORGET IT!  Not a one!
BOTTOM LINE: The story already distilled - the transfer, pretty much a mess - this really isn't the way I want to remember Tennessee Williams.",1067040000,7,1830,4.833333333333333
119392,3,079079568X,"""Cat on a hot tin roof"" is a play that was filmed in an effort to customize it to the silver screen. The result is average at best; most of the cast seem like they are reciting their lines and not really living their part in the play. The only actor that gives a decent and solid performance is Burl Ives, as Harvey 'Big Daddy' Pollitt, especially when he makes his final confessions near the end and exposes his reality for what it is. That's when the viewers come to realize the true extent of the lies in the lives of the characters.
The story as a whole is a harsh examination of human nature and a study in the hypocrisy and falsehood in the society of the fifties. The picture illustrated is quite grim; people are living unsatisfying lives, married to spouses they don't love anymore, get drunk to escape reality, see no way out of their miserable existence, when money serves as the number one motivator for their actions. Have things really changes ever since? I guess it depends on the person that you are and on the choices you make as you go by.",1060905600,2,1057,4.370558375634518

It is about the trials and tribulations of a Southern family who learn that the patriarch, Big Daddy, played brilliantly by Burl Ives, is dying and how they want to stake their claim on the inheritance he will give. It concentrates on the problems in the marriage between Brick(Paul Newman:those EYES!) and Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor), the favouritism towards Brick, and Brick's alcoholism.

The film revolves around a wealthy family in the south and how they are coping with the impending death of ""Big Daddy,"" the family patriarch.

However, Paul Newman was sooo hot when he was younger. Josh Hartnett ain't got nothing on him!
Even though they didn't get along much in the film, I thought Liz and Paul looked good together...two of the best looking actors of that time! (Of course, Paul and Joanne Woodward are adorable together!)

119396,4,079079568X,"When the familial vultures hear that Big Daddy Burl Ives is dying of cancer, they flock to his southern Gothic spread for a supposed 65th birthday, and the Pollitt brood brings with it about every type of dysfunction that hadn't even been named when this scorching film version of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize play got the big screen treatment. Alcoholism, suppressed sexual yearnings, latent homosexuality, greed, ""mendacity"" and children who could be poster kids for the pro-choice lobby are all here, and a riveting cast combine to make this triumphant film a classic. Headed by a sultry Elizabeth Taylor as the sexually frustrated and angry Maggie the Cat and Paul Newman as her alcoholic and closeted gay husband, Brick, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" explores the interpersonal traumas among husband and wife and a former acquaintance, Skipper, a washed up football player who throws himself out of a window in a Chicago hotel, and the impact his suicide has on Maggie and Brick's marriage. The hint of a gay atrraction between Brick and Skipper is obvious, and Maggie's anger at the physical and emotional distance imposed by her husband is magnificently projected. At the same time, in an overpowering performance by Ives, Big Daddy has to come to terms with his own mortality while baiting the wolves with his decision about who'll get what of his filthy rich estate. In the end, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is less a snapshot of a seriously dysfunctional family at a major crossroad and more an affirmation of life, the passion for it and coming to terms with the sometimes vicious pitches life can throw. As Maggie, Elizabeth Taylor is spellbinding, and her performance is all the more credible considering the filming of the movie was interrupted by the death in a plan crash of her third husband, Mike Todd. Paul Newman, as the cynical, alcoholic and sexually ashamed Brick, unleashes a performance worthy of an Oscar, and Burl Ives is no less than commanding with an awesome screen presence. Though more than 40 years old now, this film remains a classic and deserves a spot on virtually every ""best of"" list that can be developed.",1047859200,12,2140,4.865753424657535
119397,5,079079568X,"This is a powerful film full of great acting, built on the play of one of our greatest writers: Tennessee Williams. Even if you're not from the South and it's long past the 50's, the territory he covers is still relevant: old resentments between parent and child, between husband and wife, a woman's role, the feelings that surface when someone close is about to die, insecurity, feelings of worthlessness, greed, failed dreams, new understandings.
Yet we're not that far from the 50's when patriarchy was stronger, where there was a distinct double standard and only the men in the family were privy to important decisions--where women were sometimes measured by their ability to produce children, and where so many feelings were repressed and left unsaid.
This film works despite its apparent diversion from Williams' original play in avoiding certain sexual taboos.  When watching it I could not understand the problem between Maggie and Brick and Skipper, a plot twist that takes a while to surface and isn't quite resolved, but now that I've read a few reviews here the meaning is plain. It's just another element of depth in an already deep story.
Burl Ives as Big Daddy puts on a fabulous performance as does Judith Anderson as Big Momma and Elizabeth Taylor as a beautiful Maggie.  The names, like the characters, are slightly  exaggerated for effect--an effect that works.
The film has so many wonderful lines, it's a pleasure just listening to the words--especially when delivered by such fine  actors.  A small sampling:
Big Daddy to alcoholic son Brick: ""Truth is dreams that don't come true and nobody prints your name in the paper 'til you die.""
Brick to Big Daddy (talking about Big Momma in a basement full of European artifacts): ""You gave her things, Papa, not love.""
Maggie (who's scared of losing Big Daddy's inheritance): ""Outside of hunger, the first thing I remember is shame.""
Big Daddy: ""We're through with lies and liars in this house.  Lock the door!""
And so some understandings some to pass.  The film starts slowly but crescendos into a powerful ending. I recommend this film with great pleasure.",1024272000,9,2125,4.952247191011236
119398,5,079079568X,"Tennessee William's play, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", was considered so controversial that its Broadway producers forced the playwright to alter the third act. Either in spite of or because of the changes, the play was a huge hit. Even with the changes, it had to be further watered down for Hollywood's 1958 movie version. Once more, it was a boxoffice smash. It went on to garner six Oscar nominations, including Best Actress for Elizabeth Taylor and Best Actor for Paul Newman. Despite the industry's timidity back then, the movie was a searing, powerful drama about a family in crisis. That it remains so to this day, despite massive changes in social values and mores over the years, is a credit to its brilliant cast and to its director, Richard Brooks.
Brick and Maggie [Newman and Taylor] have come to his father's big plantation in Mississippi to celebrate the old man's 65th birthday. Everyone calls him Big Daddy, and as portrayed by Burl Ives, he truly is a larger than life figure. Brick's brother, Gooper [Jack Carson], his wife, Mae [Madeleine Sherwood], and their five `little no-neck monsters"" are also there. Big Daddy has just returned from several weeks at a clinic where he was treated for cancer. He thinks he is cured, but the doctors have lied to him. He's unlikely to see his next birthday. Rivalry and intrigue abound among the siblings and their families as everyone fights over who will take over the plantation. Brick has major problems of his own. The former star athlete drinks too much, refuses the advances and affection of the gorgeous and calculating Maggie because he blames her for his best friend's suicide, and is bitter about his father, who doesn't seem to love him or anyone else. Brick is also hobbling around on crutches, having recently tripped while trying to leap a hurdle one drunken night. Through all the bickering and fighting, his mother, Big Mama [Judith Anderson], tries desperately to hold onto whatever happiness and dignity the family still possesses. But a storm of confrontations is brewing, and she's powerless to stop it.
The `shocking' element that was changed was the revelation that Brick and his friend had been lovers and that Maggie's `crime' was her attempt to eliminate her rival. This was changed to the friend's killing himself because he was weak. I think when you know this, you can easily see what is going on underneath the surface between Brick and Maggie. It also makes the characters more understandable and believable. Their constant fighting makes more sense. The story becomes about more than greed, power, money and land. It becomes about the power of the human heart.
""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is highly recommended, script changes notwithstanding.",1023408000,122,2726,4.902597402597403

It stars Elizabeth Taylor  as Maggie, rejected over and over by her alcoholic husband, Brick, played by Paul Newman.

As this film was originally a play, most of it is sharp and cutting dialogue, every line filled with tension and double meanings.  Close-ups reveal the artistry of the actors, all of whom are excellent.  I especially liked Burl Ives, whose performance called for a wide range of emotions, showing his vulnerability as well as his strength.  And as the characters battled with each other, the story, which I understand was rewritten to fall within the guidelines of 1950s censors, slowly revealed itself.  Some critics say this ruined this movie adaptation.  I can't comment on that because I though the story was great. Most of the film takes place inside a house and there's almost no physical action.

119402,3,079079568X,"Being from Mississippi, and actually born in the same town as Williams himself, I have a cultural right to be extremely picky about this film, so I must begin with two down-home criticisms. A Mississippi delta accent is a very, very specific sound, and most of the cast miss it by a mile--with Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the worst offenders of the lot. That aside, the Mississippi delta simply doesn't look like the brief bits of landscape we're allowed to see in the film, and the archetecture of the big house is also extremely unlikely for that area. So if you're actually expecting to find any sense of the region, you're out of luck. Most viewers probably won't notice these problems, but they are a drawback, for William's work is always as much about place as about character and plot, and the film's failure to accurately capture it is a diservice to both audience and creator.
That said, the big problem with CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is 1950s censorship: it simply wasn't possible to film a play about an unconciously homosexual man's inability to forgive his oversexed wife for her role in his pseudo-lover's death. As a result, the film sidesteps the entire issue and focuses on the sub-plot of just who is going to inherit Big Daddy's estate when he dies. Accents aside, the cast does quite well, with supporting players Anderson, Carson, and Sherwood particular standouts--but the end result is just so much steam without substance, well done but not particularly meaningful.",1010188800,5,1491,4.80544747081712
119403,5,079079568X,"T.Williams, shows in his composition some of the issues and problems that preoccupies the human being, problems that obstruct the perfection of existence, in my point of view. The main topic in the play is the relationship between Brick-30 years old, to his father that is dying, and obviously,when we tend to loose something-we understand the value of it, and try to make the best of what left from it.
In the end of his life, Big Daddy and Brick say all about truth, medacity, hypocrisy and life in general-with life experience of an old man, and difficulties of a young man that looking for a brighter side of his life. and aside the main topic, there also some subjects like the value of memories against material giving, and what love is really worth.
Some of the subject that exist in the text, which I find them very intresting, like the question wheather a son should fulfill father's dreams to acquire his appreciation-when Gooper,the first born son, confess to his father that he did all his father wanted his to be, and now try to admonish his rights on the rich property. Another issue, is wheather we should surrender to all the defects in the reality and in our life,to all the morbidities of, in hypocracy, the mendacity aruond us,like BigDaddy said-40 years he married to his woman in hypocracy, like material dream of his son Gooper and his wife, which make their eyes go blind to the suffer of Big Daddy, or should we go against it and try to fix it. This contrast make us to feel alienation to the world-and, to my mind, makes people to desire to steer clear from the reality, and drives them to drink alcohol and to use drugs.

119404,3,079079568X,"Whatever Williams might have said in his Memoirs (which manage to be both revealing and unreliable at the same time), it is fairly well-known that he pretty well hated this popular film version of what is arguably his most perfect masterpiece - and with some justification.  There's very little of his play left in Richard Brooks' slick adaptation.  This is certainly partly a result of the puritanism of the era - the cinema of the Fifties was in no way as liberal as the stage when it came to matters of the flesh.  But that doesn't necessarily account for the changes in plot and particularly character that Brooks made - changes that amount almost to emasculation.  Paul Newman is eminently believable as Brick; it's not his fault that the character as conceived for the screen lacks the conflicted depth and complexity of his theatrical counterpart.  Elizabeth Taylor is certainly fierce and sexy as Maggie, but what she - like the whole film - lacks is an understanding of the sensual rhythms of the dialogue; hardly surprising, I suppose, when there is so little of Williams' actual dialogue left.  The elusive richness and tantalizing ambiguity of the play have been abandoned in favor of a more straightforward, simplified, and significantly altered reading of the plot - one that transforms Williams' savage and ironic and mysterious exploration of truth and mendacity into a more conventional postwar domestic drama that may actually have more affinites with the very different work of Arthur Miller.  As it is, Brooks' version stands as a good movie in its own right.  It just also happens to be a bad adaptation of a very great play.",997056000,13,1646,4.89568345323741

But I have read and seen other Tennessee Williams plays, and I have always been impressed by how richly the  characters and conflict are drawn, and this story is no exception.  The one  thing that stands out the most for me in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is the  character of Maggie as played by Elizabeth Taylor.  She's incredibly  beautiful and sexy in her role as the frustrated Maggie, and it is one of  her greatest performances.  But she's not the only one that delivers.  Paul  Newman is excellent as her alcoholic husband Brick, Burl Ives as Big Daddy  fills the screen with a powerful performance, Judith Anderson as Big Mama  is also strong, and Madeleine Sherwood as the very fertile sister-in-law is  so good at being catty and greedy you'll hate her.  The story explores the  lies, the rivalries, and the greed that tear apart a Southern family.  The  way they talk about each other is very pointed and often humourous, but the  way they hurt each other is painful, and Williams and the screenwriters  manage to walk a fine balance between the two. This is one of the screen's  great dysfunctional families, and also one of its most memorable.",958867200,2,1259,4.556053811659193
119410,5,079079568X,"Most people cite this one as memorable because of the performances of Taylor and Newman, and while both are excellent, I think it's Burl Ives as Big Daddy who literally steals the show (he and Madeleine Sherwood, who is  also excellent, were reprising their Broadway roles).  Taylor gives what I  feel is her best performance on the heels of personal tragedy (as many film  fans know, her husband Mike Todd was killed not long before this movie in a  plane crash) -  this is probably her most subdued performance and to me,  she's always better when she keeps herself under control (as compared to,  say,  ""Reflections in a Golden Eye,"" ""Cleopatra,"" or  ""Boom!"").  Madeleine Sherwood definitely deserved an Oscar  Nomination as ""Sister Woman"" May, one of the screen's most  hideous harridans, the ""monster of fertility"" (you just want to  give this woman some birth control tablets).  It's hard for me to  concentrate on symbolism when I watch this movie - I get engulfed in some  of the humor and the general family warfare that prevails, but like all  Williams plays / films, it features a fragile Southern woman who ends up  getting trounced on (""Big Mama"" Judith Anderson) and a whole slew  of characters who are hiding things about themselves and are too scared to  face reality (I think every character could be put under this umbrella in  one way or another).  Without a doubt, my favorite Tennesee Williams drama  and the best one adapted to film (yes, I remember ""Streetcar."")",956448000,5,1485,4.824701195219124
119411,5,079079568X,"Playwright Tennessee Williams' genius and sympathy for the human condition is again evident in this brilliant, though censored, adaptation of the equally brilliant play. Incredibly, the censorship does not hurt the plot,  and the acting is so spectacular one hardly notices. The characterization  of Maggie, played to perfection by the incredibly beautiful Elizabeth  Taylor, as a ""cat on a hot tin roof"" shows Williams' sympathy for  the character, who is much, much more than a ""money-grubbing  sexpot"" as one reviewer put it. She is ""Unfulfilled Woman""  personified, denied the love she hungers for from her husband, also played  brilliantly by Paul Newman, who has turned alcoholic and cold toward her  because of his own self-hate and disgust with ""mendacity."" Her  need for love, security, and a future are contrasted with Brother-man and  Sister-woman's out-and-out greed and desire for more than they need, like  the brood of ""no-neck monsters"" they put on display ""like  animals at county fair"" to try to win the favor of irascible, dying,  and in-denial millionaire Big Daddy (Burl Ives). Big Mama (Judith Anderson)  gives a superlative performance as the faithful wife who, like Maggie, is  ever trying to coax warmth from her husband. (What's wrong with these men?)  And Madeleine Sherwood as Sister-woman is the true perfect cat of this  movie and played to feline ferocity. I actually like the ending of the  movie better than the play's--and, judging by the palpable chemistry  between Newman (who, unlike his play's character, comes off as very  heterosexual) and Taylor in the movie, well...judge for yourself whether he  preferred it too.",954460800,9,1656,5.244274809160306

Paul Newman give a focused, anguished portrayal of Brick, and Judith  Anderson is magnificent as Big Mama.

If you like these two actors 99% of the time the camera is on the two of them.
Newmans in his early 30's Taylor in her mid 20's.  Great eye candy (both of them)",1521676800,,333,3.8970588235294117
