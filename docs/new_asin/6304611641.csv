910312,5,6304611641,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time because of it's subtle message of the importance and necessity in having to honestly define yourself before you can accept love in to your life.  The restaurant scenes  are a riot. I laughed until I cried.  The depiction of how women and men  view relationships and most things differently and how people bring their  beliefs from their family of origin in to their relationships is also well  done. This is a funny, gentle, yet realistic depiction of the the types of  speed bumps everyone gets to encounter in relationships. Great food for  thought.",958780800,5,602,4.721153846153846

I'm all for corny love stories, but this one is so poorly done, so weakly directed and sappily planned, that I could  hardly keep my popcorn down.  The plot is one gigantic contrivance that  loses its charm in the first quarter of the film.  I recommend some other  movie, just about any any other movie, over this one.",956016000,2,423,4.5

This movie has a nice concept, good character development and solid chemistry between players. It is a romantic comedy but not an overly frilly one.

This is a lovely film.  Romantic and quirky, with highly enjoyable performances by Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dylan McDermott and a pre-SATC turn by Sarah Jessica Parker.  I live in Los Angeles, CA where the film takes place, and the settings feel oh, so familiar.
There are some elements that recall other favorites of mine: Frequency and Sliding Doors.  For a while, 'Til There Was You was so rarely on television that finally, I purchased it.",1220572800,3,590,6.2592592592592595

Before I accuse the other reviewers as being jealous , having never accepted their coincidences as serendipitous, I will admit that 'Til There Was You"" is as cute-zee as ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" a completely different story line, but nonetheless like this movie, fluff that is as  fun to watch -as cotton candy is good to eat. This is what being a movie buff is all about, you can't dine on the deep and the serious all day.

910497,4,6304611641,"I am a little surprised at the one star ratings.  I love movies that complete a circle, those are rare and this is one of those.  This was a really good movie.  If you like something a little different from the typical romantic comedy, this is a good choice.  It has doses of reality in it and maybe that is what some folks did not like.  I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  The main characters flaws give you more to identify with than some other romantic comedies.  In particular, the soundtrack is perfection.  Sometimes I just leave the credits on repeat to listen to the music.  It is highly enjoyable.",1178496000,5,628,4.299145299145299

910617,5,6304611641,"Gwen and Nick spend their whole lives just missing eachother.

They bump into each other (literally) when they were about 6 years old and over the next 20 years they just miss meeting eachother. There are so many times that they might of seen each other if only that by the time that they actually do meet each other going for a cigarette at a meeting for people to try to stop smoking that you want to say ""finally.""

All in all though it is a very good movie and Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn are both excellent as the older Nick and Gwen and Sarah Jessica Parker is also very good as Nicks girlfriend Francesca a washed up former television star whom everybody thinks is dead.",1103328000,15,688,4.409448818897638
910618,5,6304611641,"I thought this movie to be charming and witty.  Though it would appear to be very light, you look deeper and pay attention to how the characters roll around each other, it becomes somewhat of a fun, tangled web-much like our own lives would be seen if we could view them from a third person.  Happy and sad, it's a great flick for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  As an added bonus who knew Jeanne Tripplehorn could do slightly, slapstick humor the way she does, hats off to her.  Add tacky, tasteless and yes, tired Sarah Jessica Parker and its great!!",1063843200,6,547,4.44
910619,1,6304611641,"I actually did look forward to the release of this film due to the premise of the plot and being a sucker for a good romantic comedy. An added bonus was that Scott Winant of ""thirtysomething"" fame (my all-time favorite television show) was the director/producer. Simple plot- two people meet briefly throughout their lives on parallel courses until their lives become involved with the future of an old apartment building slated for demolition. The Fates enlighten them with the realization that they are soulmates destined to meet and fall in love. Well, I was a sucker- for going to see this movie! I can't think of another movie that got yanked out of my local cinema faster than this one was (less than a week). I can't think of another movie in recent memory that I checked my watch as many times as I did during this flick. It was more exciting to look at my watch dial than the movie screen.
While the story did have brief flashes of brillance in some of the dialog pertaining to life philosophies, they were few and far between. Dylan McDermott, always a good actor, absolutely flubs here. Sarah Jessica Parker, never one of my favorite actresses, looks so bad in this film to me that I was afraid my eyes were going to bleed... I guess I couldn't look away every time she was on the screen for that reason. Jean Tripplehorn's attempts at physical comedy left me gasping. Everytime she was hit with something or knocked down or fell, I wanted to jump into the movie and yell at the director (or call PETA) for torturing this poor woman that way. At least Jennifer Aniston and Ken Olin had the good sense to save their careers by appearing only briefly in minor supporting roles.
The self-angsting dialogue on ""thirtysomething"" worked incredibly well and bonded you to the characters. In this movie, listening to the characters bemoan their life circumstances you finally say, ""Enough is enough!"" and hope they all get hit by a bus so they stop talking. The plot flows along very disjointedly and at a very slow pace. I felt no chemistry between the two main characters, who are destined to meet and fall in love. The finale takes a sudden awkward jump a few years later when the couple are married and putting their child to bed. How the plot/premise went from ""A"" to ""B"" (how this couple fell in love and decided to make a life commitment) was left unanswered by the film and made the ending very unsatisifying, disappointing, and unbelievable.
Whoever the hair stylist was for this film should never work again. <heh heh> Mr. McDermott has a great head of hair. His greased look in this film- not a ""successful architect style"", that's for sure- terrible and very distracting! Ms. Parker's hair style?? My nightmares as a 5 year old were not as scary as this disaster on her head!
In all fairness, I will say some one good thing about this film. The cinematography is wonderful, especially around the apartment complex. You always see this dust, fuzz, or pussy willow type stuff floating in the air in the building's courtyard. I'm still trying to figure out the symbolism intended by the director of this effect. There are quite a few recognizable name actors in this film, but remember ""Mars Attacks""? The film is such a flub, it is one of those movies you will want to watch more than once because the acting and dialogue are so bad.... like a horrible car wreck with blood, gore, and screams of agony- you can't take your eyes away! (heh heh) I always put this movie on when I'm in a masochistic mood and feel the need to be punished by Hollywood.",1053129600,5,3561,4.60062893081761
910620,1,6304611641,"There are so many things wrong with this movie it is hard to know where to start.  The sub-plot where the characters are attempting to preserve the historic apartment complex is resolved in the most unsatisfying way possible.  The heroine's parents' story is also cringe worthy.  The movie seems to be both promoting and simultaneously mocking the notion of a ""one true love"" that makes everything else meaningless.  It does not pull it off and instead seems merely ridiculous.  Run if you see this movie coming!",1011484800,2,512,4.906976744186046
910621,1,6304611641,"It's no surprise that ""'Til There Was You,"" the feature film directorial debut of television director Scott Winant, ends up feeling like a  two-hour special episode of a sitcom. While the movie tries to pull off a predictable and ridiculous plot by forcing us into the lives of two people meant to fall in love more than 20 years after they initially meet, it only serves to show us just how uninvolving and dreary their lives are, until we are so starved for something, ANYTHING, to happen that we wish they would just get it on and be done with it.
It doesn't help the movie that the beginning is a mess, and as it plods on, the script does little more than add insult to injury. It opens with the lives of youngsters Gwen and Nick (played as adults by Jeanne Tripplehorn and Dylan McDermott): Gwen's mother is a controlling feminist who won't let her father finish a sentence, while Nick's father is a drunkard who won't find a decent job.
Soon, they're all grown up, with fancy jobs they never seem to work at, and lives that are less than appealing. Gwen is a ghost writer who believes that everything in life will be picture perfect once she finds the right man for her, while Nick is an architect who has trouble with commitment to just about everything. How these two people could ever share a life together is beyond me, but the movie will spend its entire proving me wrong, changing their lives in ways you won't want to bear witness to without a sedative on hand.
If this weren't enough to completely bore someone to tears, the plot hook takes almost an hour to arrive, centering around an apartment building known as La Fortuna, which is owned by former child star Francesca (Sarah Jessica Parker), who played the role of Taffy in the 60's sitcom ""On Big Happy Family"" (looks strangely akin to ""The Brady Bunch,"" only cornier). The building is the only structure standing in the way of a larger complex helmed by Nick's company; of course, Nick falls for her charms, lands her a big deal, and they fall in love, right about the same time that Gwen moves into La Fortuna and becomes acquainted with all of her neighbors.
There are forces at work in this film you would not believe, predictability topping the list. Here is a movie that virtually goes nowhere, choosing to take the weary, well-worn paths of so many romantic comedies before it that there is no plot twist or story line we don't see coming at least half an hour before it appears. Much of the movie feels slapped together, with certain scenes that have no impact on the overall plot other than to add to the already-lengthy running time. One doesn't even get the feeling that there is an attempt being made to stitch something plausible together amidst the dreck, and that's something that could give it the push it so desperately needed.
The attempts at romance and comedy are listless and unremarkable. Winant wastes no time in making Gwen out to be little more than a hopeless romantic, as well as a hopeless idiot, who is prone to running into things, losing her balance and falling into various people, causing accidents, losing her line of thought, etc. The film wastes Tripplehorn, as well as McDermott, who's character is a typical man who sees the light at the end of the tunnel, though there's not a minute of believable emotion present. Even Parker can't save the day, her sluttish blonde bimbo coming off as tawdry but evoking little humor.
For those who enjoy films with no sense, and like knowing how it will all turn out, then this movie will no doubt rank as a winner. Anyone else will find themselves drowning in one of the most insipid, ludicrous, and monotonously ongoing gab fests they've ever encountered. It's a standard, run-of-the-mill waste of talent and money; the fact of the matter is, 'til there was ""'Til There Was You,"" romantic comedies actually had a good name.",1010880000,7,3870,4.616835994194485
910622,5,6304611641,"Stories intertwine through our lives, around life events, past our passions, and a few stories themselves remind us of this. ""'Til There Was You"" makes this self-conscious storytelling into a delightful journey.
Two journeys, in fact, because it takes the title literally. Two fascinating people (writer Jeanne Tripplehorn, architect Dylan McDermott) are shown growing up and constantly seeking passion and connection in their lives, but finding no way to hold on to either. When a bit of serendipity comes along, they both are transformed: An historic and almost otherworldly Los Angeles apartment house shows magic and belonging to her, substance and commitment to him. The ironies lie in her defending it in anonymous letters, his falling in love with the letters while designing the building's replacement, the building being owned by his lover, whose book is being ghostwritten by ... but you may get the idea. The writer and the architect are woven together by ties and resonances they cannot imagine, and yet they've never even (formally) met.
It's a rich, intricate, hilarious, and wry screenplay, written by a principal writer of ""thirtysomething"" and writer/creator of ""My So-Called Life."" The acting is touching and passionate, especially when one realizes that it's two connecting love stories -- about learning to love and respect yourself, before you can find the serendipities of life. This isn't a conventional romantic comedy or drama. The couple isn't what is important here. The individuals are.
In ""The Fountainhead,"" Ayn Rand wrote: ""To say 'I love you,' one must know first how to say the 'I.'"" These characters don't know, at first, but they're open to life, and they find out, playing with and against friends, neighbors, and lovers. Their journey is what will enthrall you. The ending almost doesn't matter.

Gwen's best friend from private elementary school Debbie (Jennifer Aniston) is adored by clumsy geek nerd Dean. Surgeon Debbie and psychiatrist Dean's daughter Chelsea is the light of Gwen's life. Debbie ""you think I'm done because I have these things that I have. Like the end of a story. It's not."" Dean spends his time in his car listening to music. Debbie: I don't know why . . . . It's just the way it is when you share a life with someone. It's complicated.

Gwen fails to empathize with the struggles Debbie faces as a married working mother, and how much Debbie needs and values Gwen's friendship. Gwen is too self absorbed waiting for her life to begin. [ASIN:080214442X Waiting for Godot (Eng rev): A Tragicomedy in Two Acts] Samuel Beckett

Gwen's poetry lecturer Gregory (Ken Olin) seduces with: Oh hasten not this loving act, rapture, where self and nonself meet. My life has been awaiting you. Your footfall is my own heart's beat.

Gregory chastises Gwen: this tragic romantic fantasy you cling to is just an addiction our sick society encourages.

Gwen finds her dream of life as a poet's wife shattered by the discovery of Gregory kissing another classmate Kevin Halpern.

Smoker Angenelle (Kasi Lemmons artist daughter of a poet herself) is an architecture student trying to quit via Nicotine Anonymous.

Faustus Daukantis' nephew is Nicholas Daukantis an American architecture student of Sophia Monroe (Nina Foch), the first woman  of LA architecture. In the sprawling desert Monroe defined intimate courtyards to embrace and nurture neighbors into friends and surrogate families. As the son of an alcoholic, Nick tells Sophia: I never really believed I could amount to much. Well, until you. Sophia replies: I know what that's like. The feeling that you will never belong, that you will never be good enough. A radio in the background reports TV star Francesca Lanfield has been arrested on cocaine charges. Nick switches to The Platters singing I'm The Great Pretender.

Nick is sexually involved with a British real estate agent Suzanne (Alexa Jago). Suzanne shows Gwen an apartment then sideswipes her while talking with Nick on her cell, which shoves Gwen into rear ending Kevin.

Jonny Hassenschmidt elementary school monitor changes his name in adulthood to Jon Hass. Nicholas Daukantis' family shortens their name to Daukan in America.

Gwen, Nick and Jon Hass attend Warner Avenue Elementary school together and their lives criss-cross through college and early careers. Nonsmoker Jon Hass City Councilman considers the permit for demolition of La Fortuna for the new Murdstone Heep complex. La Fortuna is an 18 apartment property owned by control obsessed Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker) which prevents Murdstone Heep initiating construction.

Smoker Francesca Lanfield played Taffy for a decade in the popular TV series One Big Happy Family with signature line: Right, Stinky?  When the show is canceled, Francesca enrolls full time at crystal meth university. Her lover - business manager Bob (Reg Rogers) shelters her financially by investing her earnings in La Fortuna, a Sophia Monroe landmark of 18 apartments clustered around an open courtyard fountain.

Smoker Bob hires smoker Gwen to ghostwrite smoker Francesca's biography.

Francesca designates Nick as principal architect for the Murdstone Heep complex. Francesca: I enjoy bending people to my will. . . . I just wanted to help you. But nobody's allowed to do that, are they? because you don't need anything from anybody. Isn't that the story of your life?

Francesca's insight into the lies we tell ourselves as the source and motivation of behavior is piercing. But knowledge doesn't necessarily translate into changed behavior. Reading all the swimming books in the world doesn't improve swimming ability without stepping into the water and challenging fear of failure.

Harriet Keeney (Alice Drummond) an early Silent Film star resided with her mother in La Fortuna beginning in 1936. Irving a Jew first kissed Harriet while they listened to At Last. Harriet's Omaha bred mother forbade her marriage to Irving. Harriet and Irving continue to meet but not marry, even into their 80s.

Junior architect Nicholas spins fables of family wealth, private school, private Learjet, and not being allowed TV as a child. Francesca is entranced, as an actress only valued as the imaginary trophy Taffy, meeting a man who appreciates her as a unique human being is highly enjoyable.

Francesca: how long have you lived here? Nick: 2 1/2 years. Francesca: you should unpack.
Nick: it's temporary. Francesca: like insanity?

Nick: I plan to design my own place in the near future. Francesca: you can't unpack because you don't really live here. You live in this place in your mind that's so perfect it's too good for you. 'Cause who are you to deserve someplace perfect? You are this slob who can't even unpack.  I never went to college. Nick: What this place needs is a piano. Francesca: I'd buy you a piano tomorrow only you'd hate it. You would prefer to dream of a perfect piano in the future than a piano in actuality.

Francesca is intuitive intelligent and perceptive about human preference to procrastinate, to not try, rather than take a chance on trying and failing. Being rejected is deftly avoided through procrastination in relationship, in career, in life. Francesca's decades of inpatient rehabilitation offer her insight into using cigarettes, cocaine, crystal meth, spending money, self pity, seduction, manipulation to distract from self doubt loneliness insecurity, whereas Nick, like most of us, is oblivious to the sources motivating his behavior.

Compassion is not the sole province of smokers.

Explanation does not excuse harm. Victim is not synonymous with innocence; victim implies powerlessness. Second hand smoke lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers equal deaths from colon cancer each year. Disease is not the same as illness. Disease is a pathological change in physiology. Illness is perception.

Gwen rear ends old classmate Kevin Halpern who is sorting through the estate of friend Patrick who lived in La Fortuna. Gwen moves into Patrick's vacated apartment and is befriended by Harriet, Gawayne (John Hawkes) and other neighbors who share BBQ gossip and mutual support. Gwen experiences herself as not alone.

Gwen, Harriet and Mr Katz (Jack Kruschen) defend La Fortuna before the City Council, including Jon Hass who recognizes Gwen from grade school. Gwen initiates a campaign of anonymous letters to the editor in defense of the aesthetic social and emotional beauty of Sophia Monroe's intimate environment. The ""Friend of La Fortuna"" letters engage Nick's imagination, now principal architect for the Murdstone Heep complex, the opportunity of a lifetime gifted by lover Francesca. Timo Heldenfelt (Patrick Malahide) is senior architect in the firm but the client, partners Murdstone Heep and Francesca, is always right.

Timo warns Nick:  The choices we make are determined by who we are. . . . Once you start down that road, there is no turning back.

Gwen applies for Historic Landmark status for Sophia Monroe designed La Fortuna because, as Harriet points out, Louise Brooks (November 14, 1906  August 8, 1985) flapper icon slept there. Historic Landmark status is granted. The City Council votes unanimously to grant the permit to demolish La Fortuna. Nonsmoker Jon Hass' explanation for why he did not support Gwen and instead joined the unanimous vote to demolish her surrogate family's home: I don't think I've ever spoken with my neighbors. I'm too self centered and obsessed with my political career. . . . Yeah, with me, my career . . . comes first. . . yeah. . . . You're going to crucify me because I told you the truth about how I voted? about who I am? You said you believed in me. You don't even know me.

Harriet: Something has come to an end. That night Harriet dies leaving cat Cinders hungry and without a home.

Nick: my dad's a drunk so I don't speak to him, ever.  Betty Daukan (Karen Allen) Nick's mom calls and asks Nick to visit his dying father. Regret about hurting Harriet moves Nick to visit his father in hospital. Nick and his mom share old family photos of his dad's Lithuanian Uncle Faustus who looks like Nick.

Francesca is jealous of Nick's infatuation with the letters written by A Friend of La Fortuna and decides to move out. Francesa: You live in this place in your mind that's so perfect it's too good for you. . . . Who are you to deserve a place so perfect?

Francesca: I don't get it. I give you the opportunity of a lifetime. I give you myself which I swore I would never do. What did I do wrong? Nick: This is the most honest I've been in my entire life. This is when you always leave, isn't it? When things start getting hard, and you figure there's gotta be something newer easier better? I know I've done it. It's all I've always done.

The geographic cure: a different someone, new name, new government, new neighbors, new boss, new coworkers, new house, new job, new state, new country will fix what is uncomfortable inside. The lies we tell hurt mostly ourselves.

Gwen writes a book Hi I'm Your Hernia with an O Henry ending. Gwen: I like writing other people's stories, it's safer. I don't expect anything I write will change anybody's life. Gwen is fired from ghostwriting Francesa's biography. Gwen's advice to Francesca: Write it yourself. It's your story.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Literacy-Through-the-Book-Arts/dp/0435087665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Literacy Through the Book Arts</a>&nbsp;Paul Johnson

5 star writing about myth, addiction, ongoing process of recovery for human beings who are always works in progress in search of an author.

Most of us have appreciated the perfection of the universe, the animation of living things, the action of the human mind, and the power of love. These things seem to denote a dynamic life force that surges through everything around us. This force seems to direct everything harmoniously but irresistibly toward a natural, definite, useful conclusion. Is it hard to recognize in this life a power greater than ourselves?
