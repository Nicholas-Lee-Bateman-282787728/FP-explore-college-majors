7862271,3,6304090900,I thought the amount of time in Snoopy's initial tennis game was too long. My small son's response was to hit eject. But as a Peanut's fan I still like the movie's premise and lessons. And hopefully as my son gets a little older he will come to like it too and be able to watch the whole movie.,1311465600,,294,4.0

7862274,5,6304090900,"i bought this video because i remembered liking the score when i was a kid. it's the not the typical peanuts theme music and the score has held up with time; it includes irresistable use of symthesizers. the humor is typical peanuts cleverness and the animation, particularly on the characters' faces, is fine.",998956800,2,310,4.867924528301887
7862275,5,6304090900,"This Peanuts special was made in 1975, during the days of motorcross and Jimmy Connors, 1970's tennis pro and features a unique musical score from the late Vince Guaraldi.
The 1st part of this special deals with tennis.  Linus walks out on his date with Sally after she yells at the other players: ""You'd better get off the courts or my boyfriend will clobber you!"".  Snoopy plays a game and throws a temper tantrum like a true tennis pro (even if he can't play like one!).
The 2nd part deals with the sport of motorcross (which was inspired by Charles' Schulz's real-life son).  After hearing about the motorcross contest from Peppermint Patty, Charlie Brown spends his allowance on a small minibike.  Marcie plays the Master of Ceremonies (and interrupts the contestants while interviewing them!).  So it's Chuck (or Charles, as Marcie prefers to call him), Peppermint Patty, and the Masked Marvel (you know who!) competing for the prize.  But in the process, Charlie Brown and the Marvel have a minor accident!  Since Charles is out of a helmet, Linus carves Charlie Brown a new one, made from a pumpkin shell, and the race is on again!",981504000,9,1139,4.780612244897959
7862276,5,6304090900,"Remember motocross, anyone? The sports-of-choice in this Peanuts outing hint at the fact that it's over a quarter century old, and make it a nostalgic throwback for 30-somethings like me. But the humor is timeless,  and there are some classic scenes in this TV special: Snoopy doing battle  with the tennis ball auto-serve machine; Snoopy riding that same machine in  the motocross race; and Charlie Brown putt-putting to a slow victory on his  decrepit motorbike, wearing an improvised pumpkin helmet. If you like  Peanuts, you'll love this program.",953683200,2,550,5.204545454545454
