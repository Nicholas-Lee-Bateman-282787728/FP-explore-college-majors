3168230,5,B00177Y9RU,"I really enjoyed this DVD and hearing all of the stories about Elvis.  Some of them really made me laugh and others brought tears to my eye. I felt like I got an inside look into what it was like to have Elvis in your life, and I wish I could've had a chance to meet him and tell him how much I love him.  There will never be anyone like Elvis, but it's nice to have a DVD like this one that is full of stories and insights into what it was like to have him as part of your life.  I would also recommend Sonny's book.",1218758400,3,517,3.7685185185185186
3168231,5,B00177Y9RU,"How refreshing to get the inside scoop on Elvis' life.  Funny and heart-warming, Sonny West's love and respect of Elvis gives great honor to the King and makes for a most moving tribute.",1214870400,,186,4.636363636363637
3168232,5,B00177Y9RU,"It's hard to find something ""new"" about Elvis, but this personal recollection with Sonny West offers a heartwarming tribute to the ""King."" All Elvis fans need to view this DVD for never before seen photographs and stories shared by his personal bodyguard and friend. Great job!",1214524800,6,277,5.043478260869565
3168233,5,B00177Y9RU,"There are many articles, videos and such about the King, but none as close and intimate as this one.  It makes you feel like you really knew Elvis.  And the stories...........  Only question is, who is William F. Williams?  Is that a stage name?",1214524800,3,245,4.5
3168234,5,B00177Y9RU,"Any Elvis fan would enjoy this DVD, but this is a real treat for those fans who like to know some of the behind-the-scenes stuff. Sonny West's endearing stories and warm-hearted respect for Elvis set the tone for this terrific spoken tribute to an American icon. The powerful closing photo montage is set to a haunting musical performance by Johnny Cash singing the song ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". You will want to watch this DVD every August 16th as you pay your respects to ""The King"".",1214524800,12,487,4.674418604651163

8265251,4,B00177Y9RU,"Sonny tells a lot of stories about Elvis - if you have read his book ""Still taking care of business"", you know them all! I would have liked to see more pictures and home-movies with Elvis - these arre quite rare!
If you are happy seeing Sonny talking and anwering questions from a public, you will like this dvd.",1383523200,,312,4.305084745762712
8265252,4,B00177Y9RU,"I enjoyed this DVD so much. Sonny West has taken the high road and tells only funny and positive stories about Elvis. It is light hearted and funny and enjoyed the ""behind scenes"" as well. I highly recommend this DVD.
I only wish I could sit down with Sonny and talk one on one with him about the ""King."" I have so many questions.",1294704000,,330,4.171875

8265256,1,B00177Y9RU,"O.K I BOUGHT THIS DVD DUE TO THE REVIEWS.. I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEHIND THE SEEN VIDEO BUT ITS JUST SONNY WEST TALKING TO AN AUDIANCE ABOUT ELVIS.. I'M SORRY BUT I DO NOT LIKE RED OR SONNY.. SONNY IS TALKING TO PEOPLE AND IT LOOKS LIKE ITS A TALK SHOW, THERE IS NO REAL PICTURES THAT WE HAVENT SEEN, I THINK SONNY IS RUNNING OUT OF MONEY AND COULDNT DECIDED WHAT TO DO SO HE DECIDED TO DO THIS.. THERE IS A SUBJECT THAT HE TALKS ABOUT WHEN THEY BOTH GO FIRED AND THATS WHY THEY WROTE THE BOOK ELVIS WHAT HAPPEN AND TO TRY AND GET HIM TO CHANGE, FIRST OF ALL IF THEY WERE REAL FRIENDS OF ELVIS REAL FRIENDS DONT DO THAT TO PEOPLE AND THEY WERE TOO LAZY TO FIND ANOTHER JOB INSTEAD OF RELYING ON ELVIS, I'M SORRY BUT PEOPLE GET FIRED FROM THERE JOBS EVERYDAY, WHAT MAKES THEM SO SPECIAL. JUST BECASUE THEY GREW UP TOGHTHER DOESNT MEAN YOU'LL HAVE A JOB WITH THAT PERSON FOREVER.. I'M GOING TO STOP HERE CAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE THAT WERE SUPPOSE TO BE FRIEND AND LOVED ELVIS THEY TURNED THERE BACK ON HIM INCLUDING HIS FAMILY.. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOUR A REAL ELVIS FAN!!!",1222387200,5,1080,4.027906976744186
8265257,2,B00177Y9RU,"You can read most of these stories in ""Elvis, What Happened?"" That book was written 31 years ago and he is still telling the same stories. Not that I recommend that book, I don't, I don't believe but maybe half of what was in that book. The format is bad. They could have put in more pictures of Elvis while he was telling his stories or a 1 on 1 interview would have been better. Save you money on this one and buy one of Sonny's books, you'll get more info.",1220572800,4,459,4.054945054945055
