8116564,3,B000F2CALU,"Porawee is almost drowned by a drug dealer. While she recovers in a nearby hospital she is haunted and aided by a ghost, which may be from iron deficiency.

Back in 2003 when the film came out, it would have been a decent horror story as there are some lines of complexity. The film incorporates the Asian idea of disgruntle spirits which run amok if not buried properly. Yes, Porawee does carry a baby, one she doesn't want, but the abortion factor doesn't really weigh into the film outside of a sermon given by the doctor.

With all the creepy horror films such as ""Ring"" and Juon""  and all their sequels and spinoffs, places this film behind the pack.

This is part of a 6-pack of films called ""Nightmares from Asia"" Six-Disc Bloodbath.",1406851200,2,740,4.541353383458647
8116565,3,B000F2CALU,"I bought this movie because my girlfriend (who is Thai) was telling me that it's based on a true story and extremely scary. While it is based on a true story, I didn't find this film to be scary in the slightest. A good film for those who are interested in thai film and for those who don't enjoy overly scary films.",1271635200,3,316,4.112903225806452
8116566,4,B000F2CALU,"Very good movie, excellent twists and turns, good ending.
You start out hating the main character, but come to love her.

Only problem? Poor translation.
It turns a good horror movie into a comedy at times, IE: ""Don't come!"" instead of ""Go away!""
If you can stand a little unintentional humor, I definitely recommend this movie.",1234224000,3,328,4.857142857142857
8116567,3,B000F2CALU,"Thailand is getting in on the Asian horror action and is getting better at it all the time. I saw this film some time ago and can't remember a lot of details but I can say that it captured creepy quite well. The dark lighting, the hospital itself, the fact that Por is in danger from her boyfriend, all add to the atmosphere and create a nice little thriller. The film keeps you jumpy trying to guess when the next scare will be and where it will come from as it could be a murderous drug-dealing ex-boyfriend or a ghost that seems to want something from Por.
Rent it, buy it or borrow it; I think you might be pleasantly surprised!",1194307200,2,632,4.231404958677686
