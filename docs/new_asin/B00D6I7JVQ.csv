We liked that the documentary was independently made and focused on everyday people. It felt like we were actually in the sets at times. Wish there were more DVDs like this. If you're a fan of Halloween decorations and haunted houses, pick this up; you won't be disappointed.",1381708800,2,399,4.555555555555555
5775122,4,B00D6I7JVQ,"If you live anywhere near civilization, you probably already know that Halloween, for some people, is as popular as Christmas.  Some folks will go to great lengths and expense to turn their houses and property into graveyards, ghost-filled hospitals, haunted mine-shafts, and just about any other scary backdrop you can think of.  These are the people that make Halloween fun for adults.  In HALLOWEEN HOME HAUNTS, we get a closer look at a few of these `home-haunters', and we get to see firsthand how they put together their attractions.

My buddy Hayes over at Hayes Hudson's House of Horror is one of these home-haunters, although he doesn't take it to the extreme like some of the folks in this documentary.  This group of people might be called obsessive, although the results of their passion can clearly be seen in the crowds they draw.

HALLOWEEN HOME HAUNTS is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The format of the documentary is more of an interview-style than an informative piece, but it works for this film.  The result is not as intimate, but it does give a nice portrait of who these people are and the drive behind what they do.

I like how the producers highlight each attraction by doing a camera `walk-through' of each one at the end of the segment.  Set to eerie mood music, this walk-through gives the audience the experience of enjoying the attraction without actually being there.

HALLOWEEN HOME HAUNTS is an informative and entertaining look into a few major haunts that you might want to check out in-person.  I recommend this documentary for anyone who likes Halloween or wants ideas on how to spruce up their existing decorations.  The film hits store shelves next week, so give it a look.",1378771200,3,1718,4.802721088435374
5775123,2,B00D6I7JVQ,"I first sumbled onto this film by seeing a trailer on YouTube and( then later heard it on Hauntcast). The trailer looked really promising so I ordered ""Halloween Home Haunts""

I must say that I was really looking forward to this little indie film. But soon after the movie started my heart started to sink. The documentary has a host and he's in every scene during an interview. (It reminds me more of a local News Report interview than a documentary)
The interviews are sadly dull and boring due to the fact that it has really nothing to do with the hardship of setting up the haunt or the pressure to make a prop in time for the Holiday. It's just the person gloating over their Yard/Home Haunt. Then after the interview it show the haunt with no one in it. But the problem in showing to Haunt is whoever filmed the Haunts didn't keep a flow of continuity. In all of the Haunts I had no idea where props were in comparison to others. (I've seen people doing a quick run of their Haunt on YouTube that looked better than this)

The movie should have been more like ""The American Scream"" and how it shows the struggle and love of setting up the haunt for Trick-or-Treat night. And also they should have filmed the haunts with the ToTs going through the haunt not just focusing on one of the haunts and have the interviewer standing at the exit asking ""What was your favorite part? or How was it?""

I had much hope for this little Indie film but it really let me down. I'd recommend ""The American Scream"" over ""Halloween Home Haunts""",1378598400,2,1532,4.406360424028269
8589893,3,B00D6I7JVQ,"Lets be clear: You have to be pretty into this sort of stuff to consider paying around $25 for a documentary about people devising home-brew and pro haunts.

Documentaries on this sort of stuff usually fall into one of two categories: Its either a TLC cable channel-style sort of thing thats light and fluffy and often relies on editing to create any sort of tension or conflict or quirkiness, or its an indie-style documentary (something like I Am Santa Claus) that really hones in on weird and eccentric characters and becomes more a character study than a celebration of a holiday.

Well, Halloween Home Haunts is weirdly (but to some degree refreshingly) neither of these. Its formatted and looks like one of those TLC cable specials, but its much more subdued. Other than the host using an actual old school microphone to do his interviews, which does give it a rather home brew vibe, everything else actually comes across rather pro. The video quality on this Blu-ray is actually quite solid, definitely HD. It looks professionally shot; it doesnt look like someone shot it with their smartphone or something. The sound is fine; all the discussions can be heard.

This documentary is essentially just a collection of people who fix their houses up for Halloween, and/or now work on Professional haunts. For better and worse, they don't seem to be particularly remarkable or eccentric folks. They don't seem to go overboard in their decorating. There are no clips with other family members complaining about spending too much money or being too obsessed. Its literally a series of people who share sometimes interesting (and occasionally rather mundane) stories about why and how they do what they do. It the case especially of the home haunters, it literally seems likes a casual conversation youd have with them in person. You learn some interesting stuff, one or two of their stories seems a bit mundane and go on too long. Id criticize this more, but this was refreshingly subdued and real to me.

The pro haunters get asked some rather specific, nuts-and-bolts questions about how they manage and finance their operations. You almost get the sense they're being asked about more details than they care to share. But overall, its informative.

Does this warrant a 90 minute documentary and a Blu-ray release? Probably not. It seems like something youd see as a one-shot special on PBS or something. Im glad it doesnt sensationalize things in fake fashion the way some TV stuff tends to. But, while they all seem to do great work on their displays and some of what theyve cooked up is impressive, nobody in this special struck me as what would be anywhere approaching the masters of their craft. The home haunters seem like they could be your next door neighbor. The pro guys obviously do more advanced work, but even that stuff didn't strike me as groundbreaking, industry-changing stuff. Its not a dig on these folks; they're doing more than I am sitting here writing about them.

I cant really recommend paying $25 for this on Blu-ray (I got it cheaper at a local toy show/convention, but still paid near $20); it seems to be firmly more of a Netflix/Amazon Prime-caliber item. But if you're into something subdued and with some nuts and bolts conversations about haunts, and want something to get you into the mood for the season, this could fit the bill. I just think theres a very narrow group of people with both that level of interest in home haunts as well as a predilection for buying random stuff like this on Blu-ray.

Also worth noting is that, at least for me copy, this was a burned Blu-ray on BD-R media. The case and disc artwork and everything is all pro, but it is BD-R, which also makes the high price tag difficult for some folks to justify.",1475452800,,3770,4.773006134969325
8589894,2,B00D6I7JVQ,"It was kind of cheesy. Camera angles and quality wasn't what I expected. The kids and I were trying to get into the holiday spirit by watching some homes get transformed into scary haunting places. We weren't looking for a scare factor, and thank goodness because this had none. The host made weird faces as he conducts interviews. All around a bad watch.",1449100800,,355,4.650793650793651
8589895,1,B00D6I7JVQ,"I love Halloween and we do our own home haunt  but this was Awful, low quality and boring",1446768000,,89,3.9444444444444446
8589896,4,B00D6I7JVQ,Very fun to watch.... but it gave my boyfriend too many ideas ;),1446595200,,64,4.0
8589897,5,B00D6I7JVQ,"I was hesitant after one of the reviews, but we couldn't have been more fascinated with this video..it made me so excited to get started this year.
What I liked about it was some of the haunters took time to explain how they do things with lighting, fog, moss, animatronics, etc..I've never gotten more ideas from anything I've seen! I even liked that they mentioned certain businesses and websites I can go to.  I started to take notes then I remembered hey I own this, I can watch it a dozen times 
The thing I appreciated the most was after the person would intro their own haunt, the film slowly panned through the sights quietly with no talking. This just added to the spooky scenes.
We will be enjoying this for years to come and gleaning it for ideas ",1441843200,2,758,4.438848920863309

8589899,5,B00D6I7JVQ,"From the cover it does not look like some big Hollywood DVD or majorly franchised film but I checked it out anyway, Halloween being my favorite ultimate holiday month and all. The independent film takes you on a near hour and a half tour of all types of haunts. From the named ""Yard Haunters"" to the ""Pro Haunters"" this DVD is essential for anyone who has a passion for Halloween as well as gain some inspiration and ideas for your own home haunt.

The interviews go in depth as to how all their haunts started and how over the years, their small fascination turned into a large tradition. From the very first home to the last Pro Haunt, I was really intrigued and very focused as to how everything was done. Every so often I had my ""oooh"" and ""ahhhhh"" moments, this film has it all. Well worth the price, I would recomment this film for all of us crazy home haunters. Plus this film is great to watch when you have Halloween withdrawals thorughout the year, as I do ;)

I personally enjoyed the tour of each house, almost making me feel like I am there, and just seeing the amazing effects, set ups and ideas these people come up with really awes and exasperates me. Each house has had people lose control of their bladder mwahaha.",1390867200,,1232,4.399122807017544
8589900,3,B00D6I7JVQ,"The greatest day of the year is ending, but that just means we can start counting down to Halloween 2014. Were you inspired by any neighbors that went all-out with their decorations? Thinking of making your own haunted graveyard next year? If so, you need to pick up a copy of Halloween Home Haunts and see how some of the best in the country do it every year.

Creating a home haunt or yard haunt is not a decision to be made lightly. It takes a great deal of planning to do it right. The haunters interviewed by Robert Hayes on this documentary share their stories, warn against pitfalls, and discuss the pros and cons of using live actors versus animatronics. One of the best tips is to make major purchases after Halloween for next year to get the off-season discount, and build up your collection of creeps over time.

Halloween Home Haunts is a fun documentary, showing the ins and outs of making your house the highlight of the neighborhood at Halloween.",1389657600,,961,4.5491329479768785

I can't recomend it enough!
Great",1389312000,,112,4.65
8589902,4,B00D6I7JVQ,This movie may be impossibly niche but its is great if you are into halloween like i am. The pacing may drag a bit from time to time with some of the home haunts kind of being less than stellar but some of them are just fantastic to see and hear what these people go through to set it up.,1385337600,,288,3.816666666666667
