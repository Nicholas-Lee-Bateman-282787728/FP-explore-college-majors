3777067,4,B001RLW9VO,This gives you a sampling of views from beautiful scenes around the world.  Sometimes I just want a little something beautiful on the television while I am cleaning or just being.  This gives me beautiful scenery to look at while puttering around the house.,1272585600,,257,4.818181818181818
3777068,1,B001RLW9VO,"Wow HD, BluRay, but the video is nothing more than a set shot of a location. No flying around, very little sound and absolutely boring. If you wanted to find out how a rock feels, then this is your video. Don't waste your money.",1261958400,2,228,4.204545454545454
3777069,5,B001RLW9VO,"Its nothing close to ""Plantet Earth"" and for the low low price thats what i like about this! Its almost like a great screen saver for each location, venice italy looks so pretty for the first time watching any bluray or hddvd i felt like i was there!",1255132800,,250,4.229166666666667
3777070,4,B001RLW9VO,"I Love this Blu-Ray !!  Do not sit down and watch this like a regular movie, cause if you did,  you'd feel like a stoner afterward.  ...or perhaps that's your goal.
Who am I to judge LOL.  It's v-e-r-y relaxing.
I play this  disc while drinking my morning coffee, as I'm working out (inspiring and uplifting), or hanging out with the kids.  The visuals are beautiful 1080p HD!!  I noticed that the BD pop-up menu gave credit to thewindowchannel.  I visited their site and it gives you a good idea of what you can expect to see on this disc.
I docked it 1 star because the pop-up menu was a bit of a mystery until I found it by luck.  Otherwise, for the price and quality, you can't go wrong.  Cheers.",1243728000,8,700,4.234848484848484
3777071,5,B001RLW9VO,"I agree that the description is perhaps not the most informative.  It is definitely not a documentary, but more similar to Sunrise Earth.  That said, it is so much more beautiful and engaging.  It contains 16 scenes set to continuously loop (and a ""pop-up"" menu to select an individual scene to loop - imagine waterfalls, clouds, crashing waves, even a ride through the canals of Venice)  This Blu-ray is Soothing and Meditative, taking you beyond the old fireplace and aquarium discs of the past.  The footage is stunning and I found the footage used by several leading HD display manufactures at an industry trade show to demonstrate 1080p resolution and clarity.
Definitely a MUST HAVE for your next dinner party or to show off your new system.",1243296000,9,747,4.850393700787402
3777072,4,B001RLW9VO,"This is a fine introduction into the possibilities of high definition or Blu-ray TV.  It is also good to have on the large screen to lull one to sleep.  There is no plot--no dialogue--but few people, except along the canals of Venice.  But there are beautiful shots of beaches, waterfalls, etc.

In short, this is better than a great many films with actors and plots and dialogue.  It never goes beyond pretty, but that is sufficient.",1243296000,3,434,4.657894736842105
3777073,2,B001RLW9VO,"If you are expecting to be transported to the beautiful locations, meet the people, find out about their culture etc or see the destinations with good hosts..then you are in for a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!
This Blu Ray just puts a camera stationary or moving at each location & just leaves it there for a while. thats it!! no talk, barely any music..in fact Nothing but a view.
so if you must show off your new blu ray system, buy Planet Earth.
This one will be better for stores where the monitor is just left on..or maybe even some Spa",1242604800,4,533,4.393939393939394
8338252,4,B001RLW9VO,"This is a nice blu-ray that shows relaxing pictures of travel scenes. I especially like the gondola scene - the camera takes ""you"" on a ride in a gondola in Venice!

I put it on while I'm studying to have something going on that isn't too distracting, like normal TV or music is to me. I can see where it would be something nice to have on in the background during a party or meal. Overall for the price I am happy with this item.",1395360000,,430,4.0588235294117645
8338253,5,B001RLW9VO,"The issue is this: if you want a disc type Living Landscapes of Enviroments Digital sure this album is going to disappoint because the images are slow to change from one to another and has relaxing background music. But if you already know that this album contains what is almost a screensaver for your TV when you are falling asleep or just chatting with family and wants to have some background on the TV that do not interrupt as this is your disc. The images also has excellent resolution, almost reference for who likes high definition.",1394582400,,540,4.635416666666667
8338254,3,B001RLW9VO,one of the many half a dozen visual high definition Blu-ray discs that I used to test the quality when I first got my high definition TV and Blu-ray player good for relaxing and listening to and testing out your equipment visually pleasing but kind of short on the clips basically I think these things were used for what I just explained above early selling point high definition Blu-ray TV and player demonstration discs for sales displays,1386633600,,440,4.7272727272727275
8338255,5,B001RLW9VO,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  The camera sits in one spot and takes in the surrounding environment as if I was right there sitting on a chair.  I initially expected to put it on in the background and occasionally glance at it as a view going by my window, but me and my guests found it strangely hypnotic.  The soundtrack is Spa-ish, which worked well for my wife, but I usually mute the sound and put on my own mix.  For the exceptionally good price this is a must-have for bringing your HTDV to life as a background point of interest.",1330560000,,548,4.240384615384615
8338256,1,B001RLW9VO,"This DVD was a complete waste of my money.  The images are passable but not spectacular.  Any idiot could do what was done. You just place a camera on a tripod and let it run.  I really don't like not being able to ""jump"" to a particular scene.  It should have been marketed as a screensaver.  I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and cannot recommend it.",1327622400,2,364,4.454545454545454
8338257,3,B001RLW9VO,"You can watch and listen some scenes for about 4 minutes each. There are 16 scenes and some of them are good, others are boring.",1293667200,2,128,4.16
8338258,1,B001RLW9VO,This blu contains statics images from beautiful places. It cannot can be considered a real production. I waste my time and money.,1285113600,2,129,4.909090909090909
8338259,4,B001RLW9VO,"I really buy this product for its price and because I am a lover of peace. But I think can most benefit out companies that sell TV and wish to present striking images and high quality to its customers. The tracks are short and lack of movement. Some, after 1 minutes you will see the same thing. Not recommended for use in the home, whether for business as I said before.",1285113600,,371,4.23943661971831
8338260,1,B001RLW9VO,This DVD is not what I expected.  I expected the scenes to change versus just a still camera shot of one location. No panning of the camera at all. One can only stare at a sunset just so long before becoming completely and utterly bored.  Fortunately the price was low so not much of an investment to lose on something I'll probably never watch again.,1280102400,3,351,4.384615384615385
8338261,5,B001RLW9VO,"This is from the same people who produce The Window Channel, great for background, ambient scenery. Just pop this in the blu ray player and enjoy a relaxing escape. I have it on when I entertain... it's a great conversation starter. And the images are incredible. When are they going to release another disc?",1279584000,,308,4.722222222222222
