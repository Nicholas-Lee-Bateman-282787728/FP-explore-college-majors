6016452,2,B00FOLGW48,I saw this movie on the hallmark channel. I didn't like this movie at all. It wasn't very good It involved his son and trying to get together with a girl from his class and following her to the shopping mall. More than him who played a fireman . Who was supposed to invite this woman he met to the fireman ball. This didn't happen till more than half way threw the movie... It was boring and slow moving getting to the point of the movie like it appears on the dvd case...Don't waste your money.. Watch it when it comes on the hallmark channel first before making a decision to buy it or not..,1391558400,,593,4.165217391304348
6016453,2,B00FOLGW48,"This movie is just barely OK (meaning we watched the whole thing).  The acting is alright but the the script and the rest of it falls flat.  Essentially the plot is a widower fire fighter beginning to feel the stirrings of new romance.  His ""sweetheart"" starts strong then begins to waffle back and forth wondering if she should renew the relationship with her old boy friend.  Background plot is the fire fighters son beginning his puberty era first love and the child's first love antics are at times very amusing; in fact, that may be the movies strong point.

I was a little miffed when firefighter says ""damn right"" regarding a friends comment about his girl friends figure.  This added nothing to the movie and now I find myself explaining to my 4 year old why it is not OK to say ""damn right"".  I admit to being very selective about what my children watch; by my criteria not a family friendly movie.

The ending is kinda sweet, but this one is pretty weak as romance movies go.  Sorry folks, but I cannot recommend it.",1391212800,12,1026,4.5027027027027025
6016454,5,B00FOLGW48,"This is a great movie about Valentine Day and being someone's valentine with a couple of unexpected turns. If you like love stories that are a little different, you will enjoy this movie.",1391126400,,187,4.696969696969697

Watch this movie to see who Kate ends up with. Does she end up with Dan or Gavin?? Also watch this movie to see if Tyler and Rebecca's romance last.  This movie deserves more than 5 stars it deserves like 10 stars. I hope you love this movie as much as I do!!",1390608000,2,1273,4.382978723404255
6016456,5,B00FOLGW48,"How adorable is Natalie Brown?!  I've had a crush on her since her days as the Bailey's Girl and she's as charming if not more so opposite Billy Baldwin here.  With Valentine's Day just around the corner, BE MY VALENTINE couldn't be a more timely and enjoyable gift for that special someone in your life!  Your lady friend will feel like she's receiving a dozen red roses every time you sit down to watch this with her, so it's really the gift that keeps on giving!",1389225600,,465,4.383720930232558
6016457,5,B00FOLGW48,"When there is an emergency and a fire department responds to the call, does anyone expect that they may meet the love of their live? In this movie, a fire fighter who is a widower meets a woman that he will eventually fall in love with and his son will love too.

The road that the fireman and the woman florist take is paved with many challenges. You will find yourself encouraging the fireman to pursue this woman and overcome his hesitation to date and love again.

BE MY VALENTINE is a sweet story of a budding relationship which is encouraged by family and friends.

I think you will enjoy the movie.

6016477,3,B00FOLGW48,"This is a fairly standard Hallmark movie. It's the story of a widowed fireman who meets a local florist when her shop has a small fire. It seems as though most of these TV movies have a widowed fireman as the main character. This one follows the tried-and-true formula complete with the previous boyfriend who is still in the picture and the cute kid. While there is nothing terribly new here, this one is watchable. William Baldwin is one of the lesser known Baldwin brothers but he does a great job in this movie. If you are in the mood for a nice romantic comedy with a feel-good story, this is a great choice.",1434153600,2,613,4.385964912280702

When he struggles to buy flower arrangements for the stations annual Valentine's Day Firefighter's Ball, Dan enlists Kate's expertise and soon the 2 are spending lots of time getting to know each other.
