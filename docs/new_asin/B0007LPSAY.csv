8048304,5,B0007LPSAY,"This is undoubtedly recommended for Anthony Perkins film collectors like me, but will also give viewers a chance to see many fine performances in this suspense anthology series. Patricia Highsmith's works are the basis for the show. There are no cuddly characters such as Jessica Fletcher or Miss Marple, but there is plenty of sly gallows humor.",1363996800,,346,5.087719298245614
8048305,5,B0007LPSAY,"I knew nothing of Patrica Highsmith (The novels, ""Strangers on a Train"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") before seeing this series. Very similar to ""Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected"", but with a early 1990's feel, much like the Ray Bradbury series of the same period. It's well written, and peopled by many talented actors. Apparently only 12 episodes were produced. I'd love to have seen 12 more! As best as I can determine, it was produced in France, with English actors & crews. And Anthony Perkins as the Hitchcockian narrator? He's a joy! He was so capable of putting a sly twist on a phrase, and all the time with a devilish gleam in his eye. What a fantastic coup to have this talented iconic man here! He gives these well produced episodes an extra boost. I gave this series 5 stars because it achieved what it tried to do, and I really just enjoyed the hell out of them. Anyway, buy them! You can pick these shows up for next to nothing, and I can't imagine that you'll be disappointed. 5 stars from me, because it achieved it's goal. A fun, interesting, exciting series.",1350000000,,1079,4.538461538461538
