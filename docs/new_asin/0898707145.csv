174869,1,0898707145,"We love St. Therese and I bought this DVD as a gift for my son's girlfriend who chose the name Therese for her Confirmation this year.  This movie was made in 1997 in preparation for the 100th Anniversary of her death, but the music, the camera work, the pace of the film itself seem very dated already - and we found it SO dull.

There were some basic quotes and retelling of events in her life, but the quality of the sound made it difficult for everyone in our group to understand.  I have a severe hearing loss - and that along with no subtitle available - made it a TEDIOUS struggle to understand the content.

All of us felt that the very basic nature of the events chosen and the lackluster presentation - flat vocals, dull narrative -  failed to capture the true spirit of this awesome saint - the one that her mother called a ""little minx"" and who wondered ""what would become of her.""  This project needed a great narrator, someone with a lively spirit and a mature spirituality to present the material.

We were also puzzled by odd segments that seem to just be filler - a too lengthy musical segment, with picture collages spinning around (probably items from her home), photos that switch too fast and have only a tangential relationship to Therese, etc.

After investing our time we found it harder and harder to turn off, thinking we might miss the good part, but finally we did.

I'm going to donate our copy to the Church library so people can watch it for free.  Definitely NOT something we would want to watch twice. If you want to see it, try to borrow a copy.",1366416000,4,1579,4.413793103448276

174872,5,0898707145,"Having just read ""Story of a Soul"", the autobiogaphical manuscripts written by Saint Therese while at Carmel,....I was very suprised in the accuracy of this documentary!
Most of the film was shot inside Carmel which doesn't appear to have changed at all since Saint Therese was there,....many of her belongings are still there. What seem like hundreds of family photographs are used..as well as motion-picture footage from the time of her life and shortly thereafter give the viewer a very real sense of the time in which she and her sisters lived.

If you want to see when, where, and how this lovely ""Little Flower"" lived and devoted her life to Christ, you should see this film,....I'll be watching it again and again.",1275436800,19,721,4.861788617886178
174873,5,0898707145,"Prepared for the 100th anniversary of her death, this film captures her life, spirit and spirituality.  Filmed at the places asssociated with Therese Martin, known as the Little Flower, the viewer learns a great deal about her life and the experiences that were formative.  Included are archival photos as well as segments shot inside the Carmel, the cloistered convent in which she died of tuberculosis at the age of 24.  Thanks to the fact that her sister brought a camera when she, too, entered the same convent, photographs exist of Therese and the community going about their everyday tasks like setting up for Mass or doing the laundry.  Essentially, her spirituality as expressed in her landmark work THE STORY OF A SOUL suggests that not everyone is called to become a ""big"" saint like Joan of Arc, someone who would do great deeds.  We are all called to holiness, an idea affirmed at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960's.  Therese anticipated this in her little way, the idea that all of us can do smaller things in our everyday lives.  When done out of love, these acts constitute our paths to perfection.  St. Therese is one of only 4 women declared Doctors of the Church, and this film is an excellent source on information on her.",1253232000,17,1247,4.714285714285714
174874,5,0898707145,This film is very beautiful. See for yourself. I noticed no sound problems at all. I wish the foregoing reviewer had not mislead  prospective buyers about this. This is an extraordinarily well done film about this most astonishing young girl.,1203638400,13,242,5.05
174875,2,0898707145,"The sound quality was AWFUL... if there was any way to return to get a better sound I would, but the content was awesome.  It sounds like a bad tape-recording dubbed a million times to the point the voices are low and fuzzy.  Oh-well.  If you love Therese, like we do, you can bear with it and ""offer it up.""",1179619200,8,308,4.1

7795443,5,0898707145,"The ""definitive film"" documentary about Therese as the back DVD cover says.

Early on an English female voice portraying Therese says, ""I must remain little. I must become more and more so."" This made me think of St. John the Baptist's words from Scripture: ""He must increase; I must decrease."" - John 3:30

Early on, there is also some film of Therese's reliquary. I viewed this at the Therese shrine in Darien, Illinois, in October 1998. Shortly after this the older English narrator says: ""Her (St. Therese's) life shows that emotional handicaps, neuroses, various illnesses - nothing can separate people from Merciful Love. Holiness is for everybody. Ordinary daily life has become once more the place of potential holiness.""

There are a number of re-enactments (or ""dramatizations"" as the back of the DVD cover says). One shows the Little Flower walking with her father, Louis Martin, to a fishing hole, which they did quite frequently. The narrator then says Therese ""soon tired of casting her little line."" As the little, long-haired girl takes leave of her father, we next see her sitting in a field as she says: ""I preferred to sit alone on the grass doted with flowers. And even though I didn't know what meditation was, my thoughts were very deep and my soul was absorbed in real prayer. The world seemed to me a place of exile and I dreamed of Heaven.""

Then walking along a shore, little Therese says: ""The sea made an unforgettable impression on me.""

This month, October, is National Bullying Month. Maybe Therese could be a patron to the bullied (a pretty frequent occurrence at schools among the young). In speaking of Therese's 5 unhappy years at a Benedictine boarding school, the narrator says: ""Some students were jealous of her good school results and bullied her and contact with them caused her extremely sensitive nature to suffer deeply.""

Therese says of her First Communion at age 11: ""It was a kiss of love. I felt that I was loved and I also said 'I love you' and I give myself to you forever.""

Msgr. (now Bishop) Guy Gaucher says about Therese: ""Therese realized that only Jesus could fulfill her need for affection. She spent long hours before the Blessed Sacrament.""

Probably the most interesting part of the documentary to me were the moments viewers were shown Therese's actual cell in the Carmel of Lisieux, which has been preserved. A female Carmelite Religious says of the Little Flower's early days there: ""The lack of sleep and the uncongenial food ... (as well as) the cold ... she endured in silence"". The narrator says: ""She smiled at the Sisters who were most unpleasant to her. One ... constantly gave her the leftovers which nobody else wanted."" Another would unthinkingly drink all the ""apple cider"", leaving none for Therese. How often in homes does someone eat or drink all of what someone else wanted a part of? On her cell wall, probably in 1895, Therese engraved the words, ""Jesus is my only love (closer in French to ""Jesus is my unique love"")"".

A few other quotes of St. Therese one hears in this 1997 documentary of 90 minutes include: ""Charity gave me the key to my vocation. ... My vocation is love. ... What pleases God is to see that I love my littleness and my poverty and the blind hope that I have in His Mercy. ... Oh, how much good did this Holy Face do me in my life. ... Yes, I feel it. Even if I had on my conscience all the sins which could possibly be committed, I would go and throw myself into the arms of Jesus broken-hearted with repentance because I know how dearly He loves the prodigal child who returns to Him. ... [G]o to Him with trust and love.""

And then there are Therese's last words on the day of her death at 24 years, 8 months, and 28 days: ""Oh, I love Him. My God, I love you.""

I have barely scratched the surface of this excellent documentary which also includes beautiful music, many pictures of Therese from all her life, and even film of the exhumation of her casket as her process of canonization was beginning.",1506902400,2,4008,4.630985915492958
