8375022,1,B002NF1QNK,"I bought this DVD mostly for Buster's appearance in the 25-minute promotional film, ""The Home Owner."" Unfortunately, five or six minutes are missing.

The film is a promotion for John F. Long's housing development in Maryvale, a suburb of Phoenix. It follows Buster as he inspects several model homes and does include him doing some classic pratfalls. Plus, for folks who grew up in Phoenix, it shows what home development looked liked during the building boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The missing footage, as it is described in the IMDb shows Buster at a new hospital and inspecting a new golf course. There are about two seconds of Buster in scrubs that indicates where the footage is missing.

The image quality is also quite poor as this is evidently a third or fourth generation copy of what I would guess was originally a 16mm film.",1415318400,,849,4.722972972972973

Sure, even that DVD set is not perfect, but it is better and complete.

After MGM took over his contract & paired Buster in features alongside Jimmy Durante, Buster left & went over to the poverty-row studio of Educational Films to make some low budget (but still fun) comedy shorts. These show Buster making the best from what little he was given",1317427200,2,768,6.314285714285714
