2004370,5,B0001IN08U,"My 11 month old son just loves this DVD.  He watches at least 2 times a day. He can't get enough of it! I think the program is adorable. The way they put in the cameos from the actual show is very cute.  If your kid loves Sesame Street, they will love this DVD!",1098144000,4,261,3.814814814814815
2004371,5,B0001IN08U,"My 13 month old daughter can watch this video/DVD once a day and never get bored.  It's highly entertaining.  My daughter is bi-racial and lives in the city.  This video is very urban and multicultural.  My favorite is ""Do the Duck,"" but she tends to move the most to ""Eight Balls of Fur.""  She is not a good TV watcher--her attention span is usually short when viewing TV programs, but she will sit through the entire 50 minute video.",1097452800,4,435,4.455696202531645
2004372,5,B0001IN08U,"This dvd has a run time of 50 minutes whereas most others are 30 minutes. I mostly love how so many different talents come together in this dvd. There are songs by Patti La Belle, Queen Latifah, Diane Schuur, Wayne Brady, Diana Krall, & Denyce Graves. The song ""Sing"" has appearances by Vanessa Williams, The Dixie Chicks, Fran Drescher, Gloria Estefan, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, REM, Katie Couric, and more.

My 20 month old daughter loves this DVD. She's completely enthralled by it and after countless viewings, she hasn't gotten tired of it. It has lots of great songs that I can't get out of my head. She's so active while watching this video. She claps, sings, and dances all around to all of the songs. This is a must-have for toddlers.",1093564800,9,745,4.643939393939394
2004373,5,B0001IN08U,"My 17 month old son actually stops in his tracks when he hears this DVD come on.  He LOVES this DVD.  It has a great mix of characters and ""humans"".  The songs are great. A must for your collection!",1093392000,,198,4.0256410256410255
2004374,2,B0001IN08U,"I was really excited to get this - thinking that it would have some nice segments showcasing the musical artists that have appeared on S.Street. I really wanted a DVD that would be fun/nice to listen too for all of us - kids and adults. Lets face it who doesnt enjoy seeing REM or Diana Krall sing with the Muppets! My kids are singing more and more and I throught we might pick up some of the songs together.

The video has far fewer musical guest segments than I thought and the music selected just really isn't that good - especially when compared to some of the really nice pieces done on the series.  I was also disappointed with the contrived story line that takes Grover all over town - it takes up too much time and is rather boring. It just wasn't what I expected. The kids don't seem to like it very much either. Not nearly as engaging as other S. Street DVDs - doesnt consistently introduce them to rhythm and counting (as does Lets Make Music), nor does it give good exposure to music and instruments (like Peter and the Wolf). Not to take these videos too seriously, but I just don't see a reason to show this to the kids - it doesnt have great music nor does it focus on an educational aspect (alphabet, numbers, etc.). Maybe next time...",1092009600,7,1252,4.346153846153846
2004375,5,B0001IN08U,"This video is too cute; I don't know who likes it more, my two year old, me, or his Grandma!!!!!  Some times I actually catch myself singing ""la-de-da-de-da...what's the name of that song""!!!",1088553600,3,191,4.787878787878788
2004376,5,B0001IN08U,"My 17-month-old girl has been enthralled by this DVD since the very first viewing.  I have really enjoyed the celebrity clips.  Wayne Brady's ""Between"" and Queen Latifah's rap about the letter O are so cute and clever.
I also like the bonus features, which include cast interviews (funny interview clips with Grover, Elmo) and 4 classic Sesame Street shorts.
Highly recommended if your kids like Sesame Street. (And who doesn't?)",1086652800,,429,5.114285714285714
2004377,5,B0001IN08U,"My 20 month old LOVES this video!  Elmo is his favorite character and the Patti LaBelle Alphabet has been his favorite clip since he first saw it a few months ago on PBS. We have other videos and many tv channels and this is by far one of his favorites.  He loves music performed by his favorite characters.  My husband and I watch this with him.  We enjoy the great artists such as Diana Krall and Diane Shuur.  It brings back my own childhood memories of Sesame Street.  The Pinball counting clip has always been my favorite.  The characters performances are flawless, Frank Oz and Jim Henson would be proud to see their tremendous work carried on for new generations!",1084320000,4,670,4.533333333333333
2004378,4,B0001IN08U,"Although, like other Sesame Street made-for-sale products, the storyline is a little weak (Super Grover looks for the Song Everyone Can Sing,) this DVD is still great fun.  It's mostly comprised of song clips from the show, including a montage of ""Sing,""  Wayne Brady singing ""Between"" from the 2003 season, ""Operatic Lullaby"" with Denyce Graves, ""Soul Alphabet"" with Patti LaBelle, ""The Letter O"" with Queen Latifah, and ""Everybody's Song"" with Diana Krall.  Muppet clips include ""Do de Rubber Duck,"" ""Doin the Pidgeon,"" ""Eight Balls of Fur,"" and ""You Made Me Love You"" with Cookie Monster.
Performances on this DVD are terrific: it's great to see SuperGrover crashing his way through the screen again.  If not for the credits, you'd never know Frank Oz isn't a performer -  Cookie and Grover are rock-solid, just like I remember them!  They could have skipped the letters/numbers homage to West Side Story, but otherwise, it's great to see Oscar and Big Bird interact with Elmo and SuperGrover,
The extras on this DVD really made it worth buying for this vintage Sesame Street fan, though:  There are four vintage clips in their entirety: ""ABC-DEF-GHI,"" ""I Like You,"" ""Captain Vegetable,"" and, best of all, a montage of the ""Pinball Number Count""(same as the song on the 35th anniversary CD.)  I also like the cover - it opens into a board book with lyrics to several songs; a great plus if you have a preschooler!",1083628800,42,1416,4.920168067226891

2004383,3,B0001IN08U,I wouldn't buy this again.  It's a little boring and the one song they keep singing is extremely annoying.  My 1.5 yr old hardly looked at the TV the whole time it was on.,1396915200,,171,4.0
2004384,5,B0001IN08U,"If you have a handful of the other sesame street movies that have a lot of singing I would not reccomend this one because it pretty much repeats all of those songs. If you don't have any or a few of the Sesame Street movies that sing then I would suggest this one. My daughter loves to get up and dance and sing a long with it, and she is 2 1/2.",1394841600,,345,3.8055555555555554

Babysat for our two and a half year old grandson this afternoon and he was mesmorized.  Had to play again and felt a bit guilty that we were not doing the usual blocks, coloring, etc.  This is a must have!  Great music.  Not sure who was having more fun!  My husband, me or our grandson. The quality of DVD was exceptional. Some reviews of others said not.
A definite 5 star!",1383955200,,484,4.206521739130435
2004386,5,B0001IN08U,"My niece & son loved this video! I actually enjoyed it as well. Very catchy tunes to singalong to. Kind of sad that they've outgrown it. They're 10 & 6 years old now. Watched it for ""old time sake"" the other day. Hoping to have another baby & enjoy the DVD with the next one, too. Highly recommend it!! :)",1378080000,,305,4.1

2004388,5,B0001IN08U,"I might say I'm a ""connoisseur"" of Sesame Street, so admitting that this is my second favourite Sesame Street video of all time is a really big deal, but it's absolutely true! (My very favourites are the ""Sesame Street: Old School"" discs, which my kids also still love watching at 9 and 12 years old, but when they were littler, those videos didn't completely hold their attention for the whole hour because a few of the spoken segments are long.) As far as the children go, this has always been my kids' very fave of all the Sesame Street shows we've owned.
The show's 'theme' is based on one of the best classic S.S. songs ever written (if you've ever heard the 1975 album Bert & Ernie's Sing-Along... which is BRILLIANT, incidentally, you'll already have a charming sense of nostalgia towards this song). It re-enforces the budding sense of humour in a child by combining a catchy upbeat melody with lyrics that are a sort of play-on-words themselves. (""What's the Name of That Song"" IS the name of that song!)
Grover, Big Bird, and Elmo are searching the world over to find the 'one' special song that everybody should sing, and the show is then a collection of both classic song clips from the early days as well as newer ones (the ""Between"" song by Wayne Brady and ""That's the Letter 'O'"" by Queen Latifah are two great highlights taken from newer episodes). My kids always especially loved the ""Eight Balls of Fur"" clip (it made them curious to learn about Jerry Lee Lewis too!) and my 22 month-old currently sings ""Do de Duck"" every night in his bath, which he learned from this video. While there are spoken segments meant to 'link' the songs together thematically, they're not so long that any of my children ever lost interest in the show or walked away. And there are plenty of funny 'asides' for parents who are watching along with their children (it's hosted mainly by Grover, who often digresses in this manner--it's definitely included for the grown-ups' amusement).
Absolutely buy this video for your children... it's one that you'll be able to 'stand' watching over and over (you won't start hating it after a few viewings, as often happens with kids' films). From the time they became interested in TV (maybe 18 months or so) this held their attention long enough for me to do things like check my email, and we could sing along to the songs together because they're fun rather than cheap or annoying (like a lot of the songs on Barney for example). Especially for the youngest children, this is better than buying individual 'episodes' of Sesame Street (or other kids shows) because there's less dialogue to bore them... the songs keep coming, and kids are very happy about that!!!  :)",1361145600,,2705,4.6947368421052635
2004389,5,B0001IN08U,Our 2 year old loves Sesame Street and anything with Super Grover.  We have watched this video several times and it is always a hit!,1358640000,,132,4.28

2004401,5,B0001IN08U,This DVD held the attention of my 21 month old grandson all the way to the end.  My 4 1/2 year old grandson was dancing and singing the song mid-way through until the end.,1356566400,,171,4.029411764705882
2004402,5,B0001IN08U,"The songs are so catchy -- this is a great Sesame Street DVD. I love it! So when my brother had a baby, guess what his baby got? And guess which song is stuck in my brother's head for all of time? ... But what's the NAME of that song?",1353801600,,234,3.7
2004403,5,B0001IN08U,"I purchased the dvd for my grand daughter, so watched it at a friend's house and fell in love with it. She's two and it was easy for her to follow and try to sing along with the songs.  Excellent addition to her dvd collection.",1347580800,,227,4.044444444444444
2004404,4,B0001IN08U,"My daughter first saw this video when she had to go to Choc hospital Christmas of 2010. We watched it over and over again to pass the time. When I found it online, I had to get it for her and to this day it remains one of her favorite videos of all time. Who doesn't love Grover anyway? I would give 5 stars but when we first got the video, it was the wrong one, so we had to send it back and wait for the correct video. If your child loves Sesame Street, I think they will love this video.",1328832000,,490,3.8137254901960786

2004407,5,B0001IN08U,"My twin girls love this video!  I can't remember when we first introduced it.  I'm thinking around 14 months.  I remember we watched it a lot @ 20 months on a vacation.  Sure, ""What's the name of that song"" can get annoying (Thanks Oscar!)

One of my girls quickly learned the letter ""O"" from Queen Latifah's song. I really like this song myself.  Its a cute beat and the use of words is just really clever if you listen to it.  My other daughter quickly picked up on the number ""8"" from the song ""Eight Balls of Fur"".  They love to try to sing along with Patti LaBelle during the ""ABC"" song.  We also love the Opera Lullaby.  I'm not a fan of Opera music, but this is a really cute song and clever words as well.  My girls LOVE Elmo!

Sesame Street has always done a great job with mixing different aspects of people...different race/cultures, people with different handicaps, different types of music (rap,jazz,opera).

I'm really glad we got this DVD.  I would buy it again and I recommend it to other parents with little ones.  You'll be singing the songs yourself! ;)",1273017600,,1072,4.453608247422681
2004408,2,B0001IN08U,"This begins with a long ad.  They made the ad unskippable, un fastforwardable, and turned off skip to menu.

That means every time you put this in for your child,  sitting through a an ad waiting for the menu.

We like the DVD,  but we don't watch it because of the hassle.",1265155200,5,273,4.173076923076923

2004420,5,B0001IN08U,"This DVD is unbelievable!! My 18 month old daughter loves it and she's been watching it since she was 14 mos. She never gets tired of the songs and the characters. After seeing everyone singing different songs, Super Grover is on a mission to find the one song that will unite the world and so he finds Elmo and Big Bird and they go on a mission to find that one song that everybody can sing. There are so many different types of songs in this DVD from Jazz, rock, opera and r&b to even rap. They are all educational and put a light fun twist on learning and introducing young ones to different types of music. My daughter loves Patti Labelle, loves Denyce Graves and even Queen Latifah. I would recommend this DVD all over again. The skits are funny (numbers vs letters) and Super Grover, Big Bird and even Oscar (yes Oscar) are all hilarious!! Plus it has a eyeful of celebrities.... Parents be warned, you will have a hard time getting those catchy songs out of your head too..lol",1244419200,2,983,4.406593406593407

Its adorable & my daughter (2) loves it & no sings along.",1216598400,,294,3.8833333333333333
2004424,5,B0001IN08U,"My 23 month old loves Ernie's ""Do dee duck"" song so thats what I got this DVD for. However, we quickly realized that its a great collection and our daughter enjoys all the other songs. She would point to the TV and say ""La Di Da"" whenever she wanted to hear it again. After a few weeks, she has even started singing a few of the songs word for word, (including actions). The singers are awesome and Patty's ""ABC song"" is awesome.

The story line is very simple - Grover sets off to find the one song that everyone can sing and Elmo and Big Bird help in the quest. In the end, they realize that everyone can sing their own favorite song and that makes the world more interesting and fun. So there's a nice message for the kids.",1202774400,,726,4.185714285714286

My son is now 8 weeks old and we were watching Sesame Street the other day when the episode aired with Patti singing.

My 2 year old just loves this dvd, and starts singing the title song whenever he wants to watch it, which, by the way, is daily.  Or even several times a day even.  Anyway, it is a delightful combination of new Sesame Street footage and older song tidbits like Bert singing and dancing ""Doing the Pigeon"".  It starts out with Super Grover, Big Bird, and Elmo trying to find that ""one favorite song"" that the whole world can sing along, and they check with everyone along their path to find out what their favorite song is.

Some of the great songs include ""Between"" featuring Wayne Brady, the full version of ""Do De Duck"" (partial version is in the 25th anniversary DVD), and ""What's the Name of that Song?""  The only part that gets somewhat annoying is the West Side Story-like showdown between the letters and numbers, although the ""Letter Song"" is fantastic, and features most of the muppets.  There are a few songs in there that we could do without, but it is worth buying for the good songs.

2004450,5,B0001IN08U,"My 16 month old daughter can't get enough of this DVD. I play this whenever we are in the car. Her favorite is Patty LaBelle's gospel alphabet. She gets so excited and claps to the music and raises her hands in the air. I've never seen her so happy as when this song comes on. She also loves ""Eight balls of fur"" and gets excited when the keys fly off of the piano! She's owned this DVD for a couple of months now and she gets mad if I try and play a different one. I highly recommend this DVD for your little Sesame Street junkie!!! My only complaint is the song by Queen Latifa. It is awful!!! But I just skip over that one.",1120003200,,626,4.016
2004451,5,B0001IN08U,"My 3 yr old son and 1 yr old daughter loves this DVD especially Patti LaBelle's ""Soul Alphabet"" - We also have A musical Celebration, We all sing together, and Sing Yourself silly.  What's the Name of that Song is their favorite of the four :)",1117411200,,243,4.282608695652174
2004452,4,B0001IN08U,"This DVD is much better than the 25th Anniversary one.  I loved the vintage shorts.  Sony wonder and Sesame Street wonder should bring out a DVD with classic shorts for the adult fans of the show who would love to walk down memory lane.  I love the Music works wonders  in the ""for parents"" section, but my daughter has yet to warm up to it. It's great to see Gaby and Miles but I miss Snuffy, doesn't he have a song too?  I've seen Bert's doing the pigeon so many times that I can't stand it.  It's on at least 3 of my sesame street dvd's already. Most of the cast isn't there for a grand finale like on the 25th Anniversary edition. Another problem I have is  with the package.  I love that it's a book and my daughter loves to watch the pictures and flip the pages.  However the DVD often slips out  as the case doesn't close properly.  Next time I would like to have the dvd in a secure non-slip case and a nice lyric book for the kids to use.

Update 2010
I recently purchased another copy of this dvd for my daughter because I wanted the Music Makes Wonders bonus feature.  However when I did purchase the new dvd, I couldn't find that feature on the disc.  The bonus section only has the trivia, cast interview and bonus shorts.  Come on, if you do something, do it right.  I now have to search for the older edition dvd which I originally had.  I am so disapointed in this product.",1112572800,2,1389,4.181132075471698
2004453,5,B0001IN08U,"My daughter has been watching this video for about two months (since she was five months old). She loves the characters, loves the music, and generally, just loves the whole video.

Unlike  one of the posters below, we like the West-Side-story-esque argument between the letters and numbers. My daughter loves it when the letter A and the number 8 argue over whether number songs or letter songs rule. She always laughs and I swear she's tried to say either ""A"" or ""8"" (they sound the same) several times during this part of the video!

The musical segments wth Wayne Brady, Diane Shurr, Diana Krull, Queen Latifah, Denyce Graves, etc. are all excellent! And their interaction with all the furry monsters makes my daughter so happy!

The only ""drawback"" to this video is that I end up singing ""What's the Name of That Song?"" all day long for three reasons...first, it's in my head, second, it's catchy, and third, my daughter loves when I sing it, especially when she's fussy! I strongly recommend this highly entertaining video...I'm sure you and your kids will love it!",1111968000,,1071,4.804347826086956
2004454,5,B0001IN08U,My 18 mo. old son loves all the songs on here. They are very catchy and fun. It's good to have the different types of music to introduce your child to.,1110844800,,151,3.903225806451613
2004455,5,B0001IN08U,"My 14 month old daughter never gets enough of her DVD's featuring music, and this is another one she loves! I'll admit I was a little disappointed when the Dixie Chicks were only in the ""Sing a Song"" music montage for about 10 seconds (maybe less), but the Queen Latifah, Patti LaBelle, and Wayne Brady segments make up for it!! And she and I both love ""Eight Balls of Fur"" - we dance like we're crazy and laugh hysterically! This is a keeper. Definitely check out the extra sections with the ""Pinball Number Count"" (my favorite as a child), and ""Captain Vegetable"" - that one cracks us up too! Great video!!",1109289600,,608,4.486486486486487
2004456,5,B0001IN08U,"This is also one of my favorites of her DVDs because of all of the guest appearances; REM, Dixie Chicks, Katie Couric, Ben Stiller, Gloria Estefan, Vanessa Williams, Wayne Brady, Conan O'Brien and more.  The Wayne Brady segment about ""between"" is my daughter's favorite part.  She sings that song all the time. In classic Sesame Street style, this is educational and fun at the same time.",1107216000,,388,4.863636363636363
2004457,5,B0001IN08U,"My now 23 month old has loved this from day one - she sings along to all the song and even acts out the ""Between"" segment whenever she finds herself betwwen two of us!

BE SURE TO CHECK THE ""For PARENTS"" FEATURE - After several months owning this DVD I found a whole other segment about music Under the ""Music Makes Wonders"" section  It features Hoots the owl teaching Elmo about Music - Don't miss this!- I don't know why they didn't list it differently on the menu.",1105660800,3,467,4.295454545454546
2004458,5,B0001IN08U,"We have many Sesame Street videos, and I have seen them all (in parts).  This is the only video that I actually have sat down to watch the whole thing with my 2 y.o. and 5 y.o. from beginning to end.  Super Grover is very funny.  The message about accepting differences in musical styles/genres, and diversity in general, sneaks up on you.  Why does it sneak up on you--because the music is so good.  There are examples of jazz, rap, opera, rock and roll, and some Sesame Street standards.  I mean, how can you beat Diana Krall, Diane Schuur for some jazz numbers, and Denyce Graves in this hysterical opera piece, as well as Patti Labelle belting out a truly different gospel ABCs.  A take off on West Side Story between the ""Numbers"" and ""Letters"" is also very entertaining.  It comes in a nice book case with lyrics too.",1105228800,3,823,4.476510067114094
