8440219,5,B004STBF0I,"It's a classic.  If your little one loves Elmo, they are sure to love this DVD.  Plus there is a little throw back for adults from the old days of Sesame Street with Bob and Maria.",1460419200,,180,3.9722222222222223

8440221,2,B004STBF0I,somewhat boring...but may be necessary or helpful to children to learn all this...my 18 month old avoids it now...may be he would like it at a later age...,1425081600,,155,4.571428571428571
8440222,5,B004STBF0I,The kids love Elmo almost as much as Santa Claus!!!,1420675200,,51,4.2
8440223,5,B004STBF0I,"I am going to give you an honest assessment of not only this video but also on the over 50 Sesame Street videos I have purchased from amazon.
1ST SAVE MONEY GET THE AMAZON CREDIT CARD, SHIPPING COST MORE THAN THE VIDEOS AT TIMES.
2ND my grandson was a newborn and now he's 2yrs old. He's been watching sesame street since birth.
3rd don't worry if your child is scared/uninterested in any video, they will grow to love them. There is still only one video with a robot that scares him, and I put it away for awhile.
4th THE WORST VIDEO WAS SESAME STREET OLD SCHOOL volume #1 (1969-1974) anniversary combo. The picture was suppose to be color it looked like a faded black and white, the video was boring. they need to revitalize the color!!!
5th THE TOP BEST SESAME STREET VIDEOS ARE ELMO IN GROUCHLAND, BEDTIME W/ ELMO(if you have a child that won't go to sleep, this video even puts me to sleep), ELMO SAVES CHRISTMAS, BIG BIRD FOLLOW THAT BIRD. There are a few I don't have yet, not many. This doesn't mean the others weren't great but these are exceptionally well produced!!
In conclusion sesame street has the best videos and all are worth the money and they make learning fun for kids!!!!",1384905600,,1192,4.447488584474886
8440224,5,B004STBF0I,My child loves anything Elmo's world so this DVD was no exception. She watched it repeatedly for at least a week until we left it over at the babysitters....lol.,1378771200,,161,4.586206896551724
8440225,5,B004STBF0I,My daughter got this for her 5th birthday on yesterday.  She absolutely loves it .  She watched it several times since yesterday.  It is very educational.,1370995200,,154,4.846153846153846
8440226,5,B004STBF0I,"We have many of the elmo dvds, but he loves this one.  My son walks around singing the songs and so do i, bit difficult to get them out of your head.",1366934400,,149,3.65625
