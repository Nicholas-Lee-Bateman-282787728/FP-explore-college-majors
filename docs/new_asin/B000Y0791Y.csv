What really makes this dvd so special is seeing Lawrence and family performing in their prime",1226361600,2,269,4.869565217391305

Now 3 Christmas episodes are released in DVD.They are all in black and white though. The 1966 episode was originally filmed in color though it is in black and white for some reason.

3010242,5,B000Y0791Y,"Just a great trip down memory lane to Christmases of the Past. This DVD is great whether you love Lawrence Welk, OR think he's the corniest thing since tortillas. You're either going to get misty-eyed remembering how Christmases were different when you were a kid (these shows just EXUDE the feeling of the era in which they were made), or you'll sit back, slack-jawed, suspended somewhere between disbelief and uncontrollable laughter.  These shows have everything from traditional carols to the way-out Janet Lennon number, ""Outer Space Santa"", complete with flying saucer. Truly, this is probably one of the most fun Lawrence Welk video items you could possibly get. One minor thing worth emphasizing - as stated in the item description, the 1966 episode is a great ""winter"" show, but not the actual Christmas show from that year. Hopefully, THAT one will also turn up one day.",1199664000,52,880,5.027397260273973

3010320,3,B000Y0791Y,"I enjoyed watching the shows from my early childhood.  Some of the video quality was typical of what you would expect from the mid to late 50's.  The last segment wasn't actually the Christmas show, but from the week before.",1387670400,,224,4.575
3010321,5,B000Y0791Y,"We're watching a Lawrence Welk Christmas show as I type this (the 1966 show on this DVD). As so many did, our family watched the show weekly when I was a kid. Eventually we took it for granted ... it was on week after week ... year after year ... and it seemed like it would always be there anytime we were in the mood to watch again. In the meantime we moved on to pop, to rock, to country, to disco, and all the other hip and trendy music that came along.

In later years of my adult life I sometimes wondered, when I'd come across an ""old standard"" somewhere, how I mysteriously always seemed to know the words and just how the music was going to go. In recent years we stumbled across Lawrence Welk shows on PBS and I realized, ""Of course! I watched LW every week as a kid! Of course I know all the old standards!"" LOL

There were a few things you could ALWAYS count on from Lawrence Welk shows:
1. Every note would be sung on key
2. The orchestra would be flawless
3. The sets and costuming would be colorful and interesting
4. Bobbie and Barbara/Sissy would give one or two great dance performances
5. There would be a great selection of music, all performed in the spirit it was originally intended to be performed
6. The same outstanding band members and vocalists seemed to stay with him year after year. He must have been a pretty good guy to work for.

The Lawrence Welk show goes far beyond the music. Over its run it superbly documented the history of our country in music, playing music from across decades of time and in virtually every genre.

These Christmas shows are a brief but illuminating subset of their work. You'll literally never hear Christmas and seasonal music performed better than delivered by the Welk orchestra and cast. And when Norma Zimmer stepped out on the stage, you always knew you were in for a special treat. Welk's ""Champaign Lady"" could have had a great career as a singer anywhere, but was happy to grace us every week on TV. When you saw Myron Florin smile and crank up that accordion, you had no doubt that he was a genuinely nice man.

Is Lawrence Welk ""old-fashioned""? Of course he is. It's an old-fashioned that we can't afford to lose track of. It's part of the history and the soul of this country.

Enjoy.",1387584000,12,2258,4.37708830548926

The third show, recorded 8 years after the 1958 airing, was just as redundant, with the exception of it being in color, and many of the band members now donning gray hair.

3010339,4,B000Y0791Y,"Well, sure enough this is NOT the Lawrence Welk Show but the 'Plymouth' Show featuring Lawrence Welk and his company of folks.  Of course unless you are into advertising - Otherwise, this IS the Lawrence Welk Show where a singular commercial displays the GREAT BIG fins of the '59 Plymouth.

And special performers....  The Lennon Sisters and  - Surprise - Cubby O'Brien from the Mickey Mouse Club.  Now everyone knows that Bobby (the oldest of the Mouskeeters) beacme a featured dancer for the program but did we realize that Cubby was also featured?

Now lessseeeeee.....mmmmm  Janet Lennon was 12 in the first of these programs as was Cubby.  Cubby was one of only 9 mouskeeters to survive all three Mickey Mouse Club seasons - Autumns an' winters of '55 thru '58.........  So this program musta been done just AFTER the Disney contract was over.  Could THIS have been Cubby's Lawrence Welk Show Debut?

Looks like a subject for further research - Noah  8-?",1292371200,,960,4.822085889570552

3010341,2,B000Y0791Y,"Well, first off, the older shows such as these aren't quite the anachronism the show became by the time if finally went off the air.  But still, I found myself wondering why everyone had to smile so much.  I like old music--I liked it when it, and I, weren't nearly as old as we are now, when most other kids were listening to the Rolling Stones and what not.  So I'm not a Lawrence Welk fan.  Never was.  Still, if you've got parents like mine, and you're looking for something like this, you might as well tune in for as long as you can stand it.  But, I also look at it in something of an anthropological mode and my, this ain't your typical big band.  Everybody smiles like a Stepford Wife.  I can think of some really great singers, Ella Fitzgerald comes to mind, and they can manage sing a tune, even a Christmas carol and not give you the feeling they're going to haunt you through the next election.

You can't deny that this orchestra knows how to play, and you don't have to refer to the schmaltz level to admit it.  Guy Lombardo was no better, they just smiled a bit less.  There's talent in spades on this show, and the music is quite lovely (almost toxically so).  What I'd really like to see is someone tie this show into a larger picture and what it says about the cultural divide.  Lawrence Welk, even in this early stage (well before he inherited the reins of the schmaltz wagon) is quite clearly not just about the music, he related to a certain segment of the population in a way nobody else did, and they (my parents included) never forgot.  They didn't tune in for the last Benny Goodman concerts, never really bothered with the Jazz greats, and rarely tune in the documentaries of the Swing Era they lived through, but if they live in the markets where it's possible to do so, they tune in to PBS to watch Lawrence Welk.

I hate to think what that says about Public Television.",1258070400,,1899,4.339943342776204

These classic shows are a wonderful step back in time for lovers of the Welk show, or classic television as well, with great music, singing and dancing, and a tribute to the wonderful Welk family. Those who remember watching the Welk show, as I did, remember the last part of the Christmas shows, introducing the families of the entertainers.

3244739,5,B000Y0791Y,"Just a great trip down memory lane to Christmases of the Past. This DVD is great whether you love Lawrence Welk, OR think he's the corniest thing since tortillas. You're either going to get misty-eyed remembering how Christmases were different when you were a kid (these shows just EXUDE the feeling of the era in which they were made), or you'll sit back, slack-jawed, suspended somewhere between disbelief and uncontrollable laughter.  These shows have everything from traditional carols to the way-out Janet Lennon number, ""Outer Space Santa"", complete with flying saucer. Truly, this is probably one of the most fun Lawrence Welk video items you could possibly get. One minor thing worth emphasizing - as stated in the item description, the 1966 episode is a great ""winter"" show, but not the actual Christmas show from that year. Hopefully, THAT one will also turn up one day.",1199664000,52,880,5.027397260273973

3244817,3,B000Y0791Y,"I enjoyed watching the shows from my early childhood.  Some of the video quality was typical of what you would expect from the mid to late 50's.  The last segment wasn't actually the Christmas show, but from the week before.",1387670400,,224,4.575
3244818,5,B000Y0791Y,"We're watching a Lawrence Welk Christmas show as I type this (the 1966 show on this DVD). As so many did, our family watched the show weekly when I was a kid. Eventually we took it for granted ... it was on week after week ... year after year ... and it seemed like it would always be there anytime we were in the mood to watch again. In the meantime we moved on to pop, to rock, to country, to disco, and all the other hip and trendy music that came along.

In later years of my adult life I sometimes wondered, when I'd come across an ""old standard"" somewhere, how I mysteriously always seemed to know the words and just how the music was going to go. In recent years we stumbled across Lawrence Welk shows on PBS and I realized, ""Of course! I watched LW every week as a kid! Of course I know all the old standards!"" LOL

There were a few things you could ALWAYS count on from Lawrence Welk shows:
1. Every note would be sung on key
2. The orchestra would be flawless
3. The sets and costuming would be colorful and interesting
4. Bobbie and Barbara/Sissy would give one or two great dance performances
5. There would be a great selection of music, all performed in the spirit it was originally intended to be performed
6. The same outstanding band members and vocalists seemed to stay with him year after year. He must have been a pretty good guy to work for.

The Lawrence Welk show goes far beyond the music. Over its run it superbly documented the history of our country in music, playing music from across decades of time and in virtually every genre.

These Christmas shows are a brief but illuminating subset of their work. You'll literally never hear Christmas and seasonal music performed better than delivered by the Welk orchestra and cast. And when Norma Zimmer stepped out on the stage, you always knew you were in for a special treat. Welk's ""Champaign Lady"" could have had a great career as a singer anywhere, but was happy to grace us every week on TV. When you saw Myron Florin smile and crank up that accordion, you had no doubt that he was a genuinely nice man.

Is Lawrence Welk ""old-fashioned""? Of course he is. It's an old-fashioned that we can't afford to lose track of. It's part of the history and the soul of this country.

The second show simply rehashed many of the songs of the first. The third show, recorded 8 years after the 1958 airing, was just as redundant, with the exception of it being in color, and many of the band members now donning gray hair.

3244836,4,B000Y0791Y,"Well, sure enough this is NOT the Lawrence Welk Show but the 'Plymouth' Show featuring Lawrence Welk and his company of folks.  Of course unless you are into advertising - Otherwise, this IS the Lawrence Welk Show where a singular commercial displays the GREAT BIG fins of the '59 Plymouth.

And special performers....  The Lennon Sisters and  - Surprise - Cubby O'Brien from the Mickey Mouse Club.  Now everyone knows that Bobby (the oldest of the Mouskeeters) beacme a featured dancer for the program but did we realize that Cubby was also featured?

Now lessseeeeee.....mmmmm  Janet Lennon was 12 in the first of these programs as was Cubby.  Cubby was one of only 9 mouskeeters to survive all three Mickey Mouse Club seasons - Autumns an' winters of '55 thru '58.........  So this program musta been done just AFTER the Disney contract was over.  Could THIS have been Cubby's Lawrence Welk Show Debut?

3244838,2,B000Y0791Y,"Well, first off, the older shows such as these aren't quite the anachronism the show became by the time if finally went off the air.  But still, I found myself wondering why everyone had to smile so much.  I like old music--I liked it when it, and I, weren't nearly as old as we are now, when most other kids were listening to the Rolling Stones and what not.  So I'm not a Lawrence Welk fan.  Never was.  Still, if you've got parents like mine, and you're looking for something like this, you might as well tune in for as long as you can stand it.  But, I also look at it in something of an anthropological mode and my, this ain't your typical big band.  Everybody smiles like a Stepford Wife.  I can think of some really great singers, Ella Fitzgerald comes to mind, and they can manage sing a tune, even a Christmas carol and not give you the feeling they're going to haunt you through the next election.

You can't deny that this orchestra knows how to play, and you don't have to refer to the schmaltz level to admit it.  Guy Lombardo was no better, they just smiled a bit less.  There's talent in spades on this show, and the music is quite lovely (almost toxically so).  What I'd really like to see is someone tie this show into a larger picture and what it says about the cultural divide.  Lawrence Welk, even in this early stage (well before he inherited the reins of the schmaltz wagon) is quite clearly not just about the music, he related to a certain segment of the population in a way nobody else did, and they (my parents included) never forgot.  They didn't tune in for the last Benny Goodman concerts, never really bothered with the Jazz greats, and rarely tune in the documentaries of the Swing Era they lived through, but if they live in the markets where it's possible to do so, they tune in to PBS to watch Lawrence Welk.

I hate to think what that says about Public Television.",1258070400,,1899,4.339943342776204
