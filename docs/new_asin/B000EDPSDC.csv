8108550,5,B000EDPSDC,"its hard to write an actual product review for Amazon about this film because there are so many different versions around. there are two english versions-the original from the 70's and an updated one which is actually pretty entertaining that comes with one of the remastered editions. there is a copy with the original cantonese AND english dubs. the original english dub was translated from Mandarin dialect(ironic, as the film revolves around Foshan which is in the heart of Canton.) and reffers to wing chun as ""yong chon"", and so on. i received a bad bootleg-the sound cut out often and the picture was terrible. i sent for another and was quite pleased. knowing all these, I WOULD RECOMEND FINDING THE MOST RECENTLY MADE AND REMASTERED VERSION YOU CAN FIND. that said, if its your first time viewing this film, youll be in for a big treat. this is the first film about the pre ip Man history of wing Chun Gung Fu. it revolvs around ip Man's teacher, Chan Wa shun and his teacher, Leung Jan. the action is SUPERB. Sammo Hung absolutely shines in his acting, action and choreography and overall this is arguably the BEST and most fun Wing chun movie ever made.",1361145600,2,1164,4.655339805825243

8108552,5,B000EDPSDC,"I saw this flick approximately 25 years ago, and it always stuck in my mind as an amazing kung fu movie!! I was not able to find/ locate this flick,,,cuz I never could remember then name of it but I always remembered Sammo Hung as one of the main characters. I watched almost every Sammo flick just to track this movies,,,,I only succeeded in finding this movies May 02,2006,,,based on the reviews here on amazon. Even-though it's 25 years later,,,I am still impressed by this movies,,,,therefore I cannot give it nothing less than a 5 star!!",1152662400,3,542,4.65625
