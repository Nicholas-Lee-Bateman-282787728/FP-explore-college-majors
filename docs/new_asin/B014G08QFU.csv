8730605,1,B014G08QFU,"This movie is terrible, sexist and racist. There's not a likebale adult to be seen. Movie opens with a grown man fighting a teenager after exploding with road rage. Next several scenes are women working in the kitchen and nagging lazy men. Halfway through, we'd yet to see a dog.
My seven year old insisted on watching this because she likes dogs but this is not appropriate for kids. The father is lazy and mean and when he goes to a Chinese restaurant, the employees were more stereotypical than Mickey Rooney in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"". I am astounded anyone needed money this badly to embarrass themselves by appearing in this movie. I already knew Dean Cain was a FOX News contributor and as a liberal elite, I'm not a fan. He even disparages liberals in the movie. Then Screech appears in the awful Chinese restaurant scene with his hippie girlfriend and it's so cringeworthy you wonder how he's been so robbed of the last bit of his dignity. Other reviewers are right, there is French kissing and a lingerie clad scene  where the wife straddles her piece of garbage husband not to strangle him like he deserves but to massage his selfishness and repugnance away. I implore any of you with the slightest sense of taste to avoid this movie like Trump avoids paying taxes.",1483142400,,1276,4.671111111111111

8730608,1,B014G08QFU,Disgrace. Do not let your young kids watch this Christmas/santa spoiler. Absolute disgrace to not warn people and market it as a kids Christmas movie.,1482105600,,150,5.04
8730609,5,B014G08QFU,"Great for kids over 10, young families and us older folks. Like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation or a Seinfeld episode this is a film about family relationships, love and fun. If you're part of a typically ""crazy"" family you will relate to this film",1453075200,,254,4.795454545454546
8730610,1,B014G08QFU,"This looks like a typical cute family movie about a young child who wants only one thing for Christmas a dog.
  Well this movie hardly has anything to do about a dog for Christmas. Yes, the girl mentioned it a few times, as well as the parents. This is really a disturbing Christmas movie.

 In the first ten minutes, the main family get into a physical fight, using there cars over a parking spot. Soon after that, the father gets into a fight with a young man at the ice rink, including pushing and shoving each other.

 Then this one relative, Brandon, who I think is one of the main girl character's cousins, is a show off wanting to prove therios to all the other kids. Brandon thinks it is smart to show how Santa can go down the chimney! The fire department had to get him unstuck. Brandon is not reprimanded for this what so ever. He later wants to prove how Santa can eat so many cookies in one night, so the others don't think anything about encouraging him to do something else potentially dangerous.

 They grab 6 full boxes of cookies and Brandon eats so many he gets very sick. Lastly he decided he wanted to fly like Santa, so a bunch of dogs show up out of no where and Brandon ties them to his sled. You don't see what happens to Brandon, but his hat is caught in a tree.

There are other moments that more bizarre, and
not appropriate for the anyone in my opinion. Don't get it for Dean Cain either. His character was strange and really greedy.

  I will wrap this up by spoiling the ending. The girl gets the dog, which you see for 2 minutes of the entire movie, and it is a full grown husky that the audience saw at the dog park earlier. Which means the grandfather stole the dog!",1450828800,6,1700,4.245341614906832
8730611,4,B014G08QFU,"I know that when you get a lot of relatives together over the Holidays it doesn't always go as planned!  Cute story with people and circumstances that most people can relate to and get a chuckle about.
The kids seemed to laugh at the antics and the adults about what really goes on.
Fun movie for the Holidays.",1449964800,,310,4.344827586206897
8730612,5,B014G08QFU,I just watched this movie and it is a delightful Comedy.  I think it is funny and cute. I would rate it as PG.,1449792000,3,110,3.5833333333333335
8730613,4,B014G08QFU,"The kids are funny in this movie. I like the feel of the photography, it looks real, not Hollywood. The dialogue is real, and usually funny, and the actors do a great job. The overall storyline is okay, but lacks resolution. As any movie with ensemble cast, there are several subplots going on (angry British neighbor, teen boys creating mischief, one aunt turning 50, and conflict between main couple about non being appreciated), but none of these subplots get a resolution. They are just there and feel unfinished at the end of the movie.
Overall, entertaining and an easy watch.",1449446400,3,582,4.83
