8086551,5,B000BGR0V0,"this movie is what all b movies should be. i rented this movie about 2 1/2 years ago, loved it, but didn't think much of it till about 10 months ago when i wanted to watch it again, and it was nowhere to be found, plus i couldn't remember its name. thank you amazon, you helped me find this movie when no blockbuster, movie gallery, family video or IMDB could. all based on the words ""face girl woods"". i had begun to think i had imagined this movie, and i am so glad that it is real.
anyone who truly loves tacky horror movies and great slashing scenes will adore this movie. if you liked movies like ""vampire resurrection"" or ""last house on the left"" you will love this. great date movie, great movie to laugh at or drink a beer during. i honestly snorted soda through my nose the first watching of this movie. you will not be disappointed.",1278633600,,842,4.26875
8086552,3,B000BGR0V0,"This movie wasn't too bad at all.  The actors weren't awful, the cinematography was very good and the plot works.  It's a little cliche but hey, who cares?!  I thought it was well done and had that jump factor I was looking for in a slasher movie.  I thought the woman coulda been scarier looking, and the ending was a little bit too predictable.  Pop some popcorn and settle down for this decent little flick.",1201910400,,410,4.413333333333333
8086553,5,B000BGR0V0,"I was very pleasently surprised with this film. The premise is that a woman that was rendered facelss is out to find a new face from hapless victims who enter her woods. For a low budget movie I thought the execution was excellent. The movie itself kept me riveted, in suspense and occassionally obscuring my vision in the scarier scenes. The acting was plausible and effective, keeping the story flowing and engrossing.",1163030400,3,420,4.847222222222222
8086554,4,B000BGR0V0,"This really is a good movie, even if grotesque, with this crazy broad wanting to cut off the faces of pretty girls. The acting was good(defined as believable). The story is original. It would have been nice to see the ranger and the lady fly off of the 3-wheeler. The ending would have been better had either the brother or sisters' newfound love  survived. I love the low budget authenticity of this movie. A  four is a bit generous. I would actually give this movie a 3.5. There is never a dull moment. I will definately keep this one in the front of my collection of slasher flicks.",1160784000,2,585,4.407407407407407
8086555,3,B000BGR0V0,"Although the execution of this indie horror slasher is below par, its premise is unique and enough terror involved that it's passable entertainment if you're in to this sort of movie.  A family camping in the wilderness hears a strange story from the park ranger about the presence of a disfigured girl who stalks the woods looking for a pretty face to replace her own, which her crazed father sliced off because she was disfigured.  For once, the teens involved are a little empathic because they're just normal kids, not beer guzzling sex maniacs.  There's lots of blood and gore, and even though it's hard to imagine this rather lightweight crazy woman being able to kill so many people and not get caught, if you suspend credibility, you might find it engrossing, if not gross.",1137888000,5,781,4.770370370370371
8086556,1,B000BGR0V0,I paid $1.99 TO RENT THIS MOVIE AND THAT WAS $1.98 TO MUCH. The only thing positive about this movie is that it has a neat cover. This thing had to have been made on a budget less than what I paid to rent it. The so called monster is a girl with bad acne. The plot is that a family spends the night in the woods and this girl with bad acne and a bad childhood is out to do them in. I just didn't get it.,1134604800,5,403,3.590909090909091
