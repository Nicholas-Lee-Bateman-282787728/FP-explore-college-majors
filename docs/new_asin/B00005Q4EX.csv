1644762,5,B00005Q4EX,"""Before They Were WWF Superstars"" takes a look at a handful of today's WWF Superstars before they made it to the big-time.  Through a combination of interviews with the wrestlers and their family members along with home videos, personal photos and other rare footage you learn a little bit about your favorite (and non-favorite) WWF personalities long before they become fixtures on Monday and Thursday nights.  In all, it's a great ""biography"" feature delving into their past lives.  In addition to the feature, this special DVD edition contains early matches of the wrestlers as well as extended interview segments with them.  In all, it's a great video to watch for WWF fans, be they hardcore or just casual.
THE CONTENTS
These are the following WWF superstars featured in this video:
1. Kurt Angle:  Kurt and family talk about his childhood and his amateur and Olympic wrestling career.
2. ""Mighty"" Molly:  Molly discusses her gymnastics background, her love for classic cars and how she broke into the wrestling business on the indy circuit as well as WCW.
3. Bradshaw:  Bradshaw talks about his football career and the many years he spent touring through Japan, Europe, Mexico as well as the indy circuit and overcoming various injuries before making it to the WWF.

7. Steven William Regal:  It's a cool journey through England as Regal takes us on tour of his old stomping grounds recapping how he was a Carnival Hooker who'd wrestle fans out of the audience.
8. Matt and Jeff, the Hardy Boyz:  The ""Cinderella"" story of the bunch as Matt and Jeff take us through a journey of their life-long love of wrestling and how they grew up with a single-father (mom died at an early age) and how they spent YEARS wrestling locally as well as in their backyard (complete with home movies of their various characters) and as WWF TV jobbers before finally making it big.
9. Lita:  Lita recounts her childhood athletic background as well as her travels to Mexico and all her Lucha Libre buddies (including a collection of their masks), her time spent with the Hardy's in North Carolina's OMEGA promotion, and her stint in ECW before becoming a world-renowned WWF Diva.
10. Edge and Christian:  Life-long buddies Edge and Christian (and parents) take viewers on a tour of their local high school where it all began for them, recounting how they individually fell in love with the sport and their intertwined paths that led them into the WWF.
In addition to the above great profiles, the DVD also includes these special features:
1. Jackie (champ) vs. Starla Sexton (Molly):  Sunday Night Heat, 10/11/98.  GREAT action for a women's TV match from two talented performers. 4 stars.

4. RVD vs. Jeff Hardy:  WWF Raw, 5/12/97.  Lawler promo.  The Hardy's had been working as jobbers long before this, but this is a popular Jeff match.  This was part of the aborted ""ECW Invasion of the WWF"" from 1997.  Basic jobber squash for RVD.  2 stars.
5. ""Angle Family Christmas.""  WWF Raw, 12/22/00.  Popular Christmas sing-along angle featuring Kurt and family, Stephanie, Edge, Christian and Y2J Chris Jericho.
6. Angle, Edge and Christian vs. Y2J and the Dudleyz:  WWF Raw, 12/22/00.  Continuation of the promo from above.  Decent match with Kurt's family getting involved.  2 stars.
7. 1-2-3 Kid and Bob Holly (champs) vs. The Smoking Gunns:  WWF Raw, 1/3/95.  Early Billy Gunn match.  Looooong match at 15 minutes (a 15 minute match on Raw??????) with decent back and forth action.  3 stars.
8. ""Mr. Manners.""  WWF Raw, 9/18/00.  William Regal's TV re-debut where he tries to teach the crowd manners.  Y2J makes a ""guest appearance.""
9. ""Hamlet.""  WWF Raw, 9/25/00.  Regal recites Shakespeare to the masses before Stone Cold voices his opinion.
10. ""No Holds Beared.""  Extended interview with Bradshaw.
11. ""Ice Rules.""  Edge and Christian extended interview where they talk about what Lance Storm dubbed as the infamous ""Death Tour"" in Northern Canada as they drove over frozen lakes to wrestle on Indian Reservations.
12. ""Spike's Hardcore.""  Extended Spike Dudley interview.
13. ""I Told You So.""  Extended Christian interview.
14. ""50 Cents.""  Extended interview with Angle.
THE VERDICT
In all, at about a total of two hours counting the special features, this DVD is WELL worth the watch, and if you are so inclined, the addition to your DVD collection.  The interviews are well done.  Some may criticize that the talent choices are a little questionable, but the stories behind ALL the wrestlers are great to listen to.
The DVD extras are decent.  While the matches may not be blow-away ones, they are decent (the women's match) and great for nostalgia (the Smoking Gunns' match and Bradshaw match).
Overall, whether you are a casual or a diehard fan, you should enjoy this video.  If a diehard, this is definitely a video you may consider adding to your collection.  Hopefully they'll be another volume with additional stars in the future!!!

1644763,4,B00005Q4EX,"I am a huge WWF fan, have been for a long time. I always wanted to know how certain wrestlers got into ""the business"". This new DVD from the WWF answers that and a lot more.
I wasn't sure what to expect with this disc. Would it contain everything that true fans already know? I can truthfully say that it is a great buy. It has interviews with some of the great WWF wrestlers that make Monday's & Thursday's so great. The DVD also contains tons of extras, some are extended interviews and others are early RAW matches. What made the disc for me was the fact that they include a match from 1997 with Jeff Hardy VS. a then ECW contracted Rob Van Dam. That alone makes it worth the money. It doesn't hurt that Molly and Stacy Keibler are also highlighted on the DVD. Great purchase if you are a WWF fan.
I can only hope they do a volume 2 with The Rock, Triple H (show some of that Starrcade 1994 footage), and many of the main eventers.",1016928000,,934,4.165745856353591
1644764,4,B00005Q4EX,"I understand the limits of this DVD - that the WWF would like to release a new Entertainment DVD at least once a month to coincide with the latest Pay Per View DVD releases, so a stellar release is much to ask for. When I saw that only a small amount of WWF Superstars were represented, I was a tad upset, but like I said, I understand why. Hell, the disk IS like, 2 and 1/2 hours long... but hey...
With that being said, the Disk IS a good buy, with superstars the likes of Edge, Christian, Regal, Billy Gunn, Stacy Keibler, Molly Holly, Bradshaw, Spike and Kurt Angle being interviewed about their pre-WWF days, with some neat footage to boot. It has WCW footage from Keibler, Molly and Regal, and good indy footage of Edge & Christian as well. Matt, Jeff Hardy and Lita are on the disk too, but their ""time"" on the disk is mostly used footage from the previously released Hardy Boys & Lita disks.
A great note to the disks credit are the extra features, which include a 1996 Jeff Hardy vs. RVD match - a 1995 Molly vs. Jackie match and early matches of the Smoking Gunns (vs. Spark Plugg & 123 Kid!), Justin Hawk Bradshaw and some other extras. Definatelly good, as long as a follow-up (2nd volume) disk is in the works... cause it would be real cool to see a Before they were Stars with RVD, Jericho, Booker, Undertaker and the Rock just to name a few...",1016150400,,1358,4.30859375

Before They Were WWF Superstars
This is a very fun DVD if you liked WWE Confidential that came on in 2002-2004 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-WWE-Confidential-Vol-1/dp/B00007M5K7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of WWE Confidential, Vol. 1</a>. You get to hear a quick history about each one of the superstars featured in this DVD. It features a lot of clips of Mexican wrestling, OMEGA wrestling, and all your big time promotions. Some of the profiles are more interesting than others, but you'll still enjoy this DVD a lot.

You'll hear about Kurt Angle's Olympic and College day in my favorite part of this disk. Stacy Keibler will tell about how she got into WCW by winning a Nitro Girl contest. Edge and Christian will tell about their long-time friendship. They even go to their original school and visit. The kids at the school are funny and are marking out for Edge and Christian. Lita tells about her days in Mexico and shows off her collection of Mexican wrestling masks. Spike Dudley's love of wrestling is told. He tells how he played Football instead of Hockey, just so he could watch wrestling in the morning. You'll hear about Molly Holly's power lifting days and how she broke records with her lifting. You'll also hear about how she became Ms. Madness in WCW. The Hardy Boyz tell about their struggles in the beginning and how their Dad would give them a rough time about wrestling. Bradshaw and Billy Gunn also speak on how they got into wrestling. William Regal talks about his days in Blackpool, England, and how he was wrestling since age 15.
