  Of course it's not Gone-With-The-Wind five stars, or Casablanca five starts. But it is 1980's-light-silly-romantic five stars. Though it's a little past the turn of the decadeof the 80s,  it has that 80s feel to it.  Decent plot that keeps you interested. Some slapstick humor. And check out the cast.  Audrey Landers. Need I say more? Jerry Ohrbach, giving some of those Dirty Dancing expressions.  Ken Kerchival (hey, he and Audrey Landers reunite from Dallas).  And the great Tyrone Power.... Oh no, it's his SON!  His son? I didn't know!  His son does a great job playing that clichd lovable but clumsy guy who doesn't know how to get the classy girl. You can tell it's his son from the eyebrows!

  By the way, Audrey Landers does some singing in this film, and I think she's quite good. And Ohrbach could have shown Baby some fancy dance steps (instead of putting her in the corner), what a great tango he does in this film.

  Won't deliver any more spoilers here. If you're looking for a fun, easy-on-the-eyes-and-mind movie with good acting, this one fits the bill.",1508803200,,1297,4.647577092511013
7821712,4,6302139848,"Although not from that era, I've always been a fan of these types of comedies.  Frank Capra style (many shown to us at film school).  I also am an admirer of Jerry Orbach's work (I recently found out that he originated on Broadway!).  So, I gave this movie a try.  Insane and romantic.  Awesome comedic moments and timing.  There is a poignant buddy relationship between the older character (played by Orbach) and the newbie (Tyrone Power Jr.).  Audrey Landers delivers a  vulnerable performance.  The director, Nat Christian, craftily incorporated the style of comedy with a lovely romantic story-line.",1438560000,,603,5.071428571428571
