8262321,4,B0016GOOF4,"I would have given this movie 5 stars IF  a YOUNGER ACTOR had played the role of Gopi. A very good story SPOILT BY AN AGING AND UNCONVINCING rISHI KAPOOR!  Rishi Kapoor spoilt the movie. He is too FAT and OLD to play the role of a convincing young shepherd lad called Gopi. If a younger actor had played this role the movie would have been so poignant and romantic; albeit in a tragic manner. Kapoor was a very handsome man when he was younger but he is too lazy, fat and doddering to play Madhuri Dixit's star crossed lover. Sanjay Dutt was the better romantic lead for this super-beautiful actress! I wished the heroine, Sahibaan had fallen in love with Dutt's character. Dutt and Dixit have always had such tremendous chemistry! It's a pity that they have rarely been paired as a couple who experience a normal and romantic on screen relationship. Rishi Kapoor has spoilt most of the movies he has starred in during the early 90's and onwards... I loved Prem Granth but he was still not suitable for Madhuri Dixit. Kapoor should have had some pride and stopped playing the youthful male hero when he began to get fat and boring. He should have looked at other male actors who had gracefully accepted the aging process. Look at Govinda and Mithun Chakraborthy! These guys were smart enough to realize that they could no longer pass for roles and youthfull male heroes in movies. Only a few actors have aged well enough to continue with these roles. Actors like Amitabh, Rahul Roy, Aditya Pancholi and others... These men are still working hard in the gym so that they can maintain their nice bodies. They are not as lazy or indulgent and CLUELESS as Rishi Kapoor. Kapoor should have hit the gym when he started to gain weight. Additionally, Rishi is a very dissipated man who drinks too much alcohol, smokes and sees himself with rose coloured glasses when he looks in the mirror! Maybe he needs to take a sober look at himself in the mirror; even his lovely wife Neetu had told Karan Johar [ on the latter's celebrity talkk show, KOFFEE WITH KARAN. Neetu has managed to become more beautiful and dignified as she gets older. I is quite ironic that everyone thought he looked too boyish for her when they decided to get married [ even though she is NOT older than
Rishy ]. I admire Neetu a lot for how mature and lovely she has become after sppening her entire married life as a stay-at-home wife and mother. But I LOVE AND ADMIRE Madhuri Dixit! There is no other actress [even the young ones now] who can boast such UNIQUE AND SUPER SEXY MADHURI DIXIT! NOT EVEN  Ash. Rai or Bipasha Basu or Lara Or Kareena or Rani can ever be as super beautiful Madz!!!  Even Rani adores, and is awed by Madz. No other female has such a breath taking face as hers! Her smile is so splendid ... She positively GLOWS on screen! The only other actress who comes close to Madhuri is Kajol! And Madz has a jaw dropping figure too. The only Hollwood actresses who are in Madhuri's league [as beautiful] are: Catherine Zeta Jones, Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron  AND alyssa milano...  IMO only... I am sure others would have a different preference... and I respect that totally...",1214956800,,3164,4.542105263157895
