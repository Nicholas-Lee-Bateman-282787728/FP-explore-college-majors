541115,2,6303004830,"This Green Hornet serial is below average at best. The film wasn't in good condition when tranferred to tape; so, the poor quality detracted from my viewing. Whenever Hornet and Kato was in the scene, I found the ""hornet buzzing"" quite annoying after a while.  As a baby boomer, I remember the Green Hornet of the late 60's (ala Van Williams and Bruce Lee, which I found myself on more than one occaision comparing this to.  I know this isn't fair; but as a result, this one just didn't rate for me.  I stop watching it after the 4th episode.",1144454400,,542,4.4

Unfortunately, the film was no longer in good condition when tranferred to tape. This is what  detracts from the full enjoyment of the serial. Many parts appear blurred  and grainy. If the details were preserved, this product would rate 5 stars.  The next Green Hornet serial was more enjoyable to watch as the original  film appears to have been better preserved.

The Green Hornet and the Lone Ranger were originally radio shows produced by the same radio station.  Britt Reid is supposed to be the Grand Nephew of the Lone Ranger.

I liked the little gas gun and the Hornet Car, that Buzzed while it sped through the city.  Everyone, including the criminals think the Green Hornet is a bad guy.  Some of it is a bit silly, the Green Hornet uses a circular calling card that has a picture of a hornet and the words The Green Hornet.

The Green Hornet in both serials is a tough no nonsense crime fighter. He's tough as nails and comes across as a determined vigilante who won't take no for an answer. I really like his no nonsense approach.

Our family loves old classic tv and movies and this one did not disappoint. If you are not familiar with serials of the B & W era, you should be aware that there are some repetitive car scenes, but you have to remember when these came out people went to see them at the theater a week apart-not one right after the other as we now can with a DVD.

Predators rule.
But wait. Stepping through a secret panel hidden in a wall of his apartment, young Britt Reid hurries along a narrow dark passageway to a garage fronting on a dark sidestreet. Though supposedly abandoned, this garage serves as the hiding place for the sleek, super-powered Black Beauty, streamlined car of The Green Hornet.
Covering his face quickly with a mask, Reid takes the back seat.  Kato, his trusted friend and confidant, is already behind the wheel.
""Ignition"" says a computerized voice and the great car roars to life, its console lighting up dozens of different buttons, dials, and indicators. One starts a hydraulic  system that lifts a section of the garage's east wall. As the gleaming Black Beauty roars, rolls into the street and speeds away, behind it the wall lowers and settles back into place.
""Let's go, Kato!"" Reid shouts and they're on a hunt for the biggest of all game --- public enemies who are trying to destroy our America.

541769,4,6303004830,"While many serials feature scene-after-scene of fisticuffs and shoot-'em-ups, this series is unique: the Green Hornet uses a non-lethal weapon: a gas gun which shoots a puff of knockout gas in the face of the bad guy, instantly dropping him to the floor.  Occasionally, Kato, inventor and the Hornet's goggled-driver, employs the less technical chop to the back of the neck.  Of course the racketeers prefer lethal weapons. . . .

Each episode ends with a catastrophic event, putting the Green Hornet in peril; these are known as cliffhangers.  One of the charms of these old serials is the humorous resolutions to each predicament at the beginning of the following chapter.  For the Green Hornet, in nearly every case, he survives by a good luck and a dash of nonsense. . . .

For example, in one episode, the Green Hornet hides in a closet.  He hastily removes his mask and Green Hornet garb.  On a high shelf behind him is a large jar of acid.  The man, pursuing the Hornet, fires bullets through the closet door shattering the acid jar which fills the closet with a cloud of corrosive vapor. . . .

. . . .Fortunately, this closet has a window; he tosses his Green Hornet disguise out the window.  He drops to the floor just as the door opens.  The man, who opened the door, is chagrined to discover the man he was shooting at was his boss Mr. Britt Reid!  Happily, his boss stands up, no worse for wear ... and the acid fumes - no problem!  Lucky!

541771,4,6303004830,"Universal's serial, ""The Green Hornet"" was faithfully adapted from the radio program under the watchful eye of George W. Trendle, directed by Ford Beebe and Ray Taylor, and released early in 1940.

This review is of the ""old"" 2009 release, VCI's number 8555 on two discs.  Since a new Green Hornet film came out in 2011 there have been a glut of related video releases, including another from VCI, the ""75th anniversary"" edition (# 8597) containing both Green Hornet serials, but lacking the extra features of the DVD's issued in 2009.  And some digital compression techniques would be needed to fit just the serials on two discs.  VCI has also issued a ""movie"" version, their # 8598, but it is a modern edit, not even one of the ""historic"" features, so not likely to be of much interest to serial movie fans.

The story is presented as an episodic series, like the radio program but with cliffhangers at the ends of the chapters.  It starts with newspaper publisher Britt Ried (Gordon Jones), developing the masked character ""The Green Hornet"" to run down the racketeers, after a comment by his secretary, Lenore Case (Anne Nagel), that the city needs a ""modern Robin Hood.""  Reid is greatly aided by his scientifically-gifted valet, Kato (Keye Luke), who in addition to creating the world's fastest 1937 Mercury Zephyr ""The Black Beauty"" also comes up with a gas gun to stun people without harming them, a key point of the radio series being that The Green Hornet does not use weapons that kill.  Members of the crime syndicate, headed by Monroe (Cy Kendall) believe ""The Hornet"" to be another racketeer, trying to muscle in on their business.  The police also believe him to be a criminal, as does Britt Reid's bodyguard, former policeman Michael Axford (Wade Boteler).

Universal's serials were not known for spectacular special effects, and some of them are pretty tacky, though the gas gun is done quite well.  The fight scenes are decent enough if not as well-choreographed as those from Republic, but it doesn't help that during them The Green Hornet tries to talk his opponent into giving up; this may have worked on radio but seems rather silly here, and was dropped for the second Green Hornet serial.  What didn't change was The Hornet's remarkable ability to survive explosions, flooded tunnels, collapsing buildings and the like without even limping a little in the next chapter.  But that's what being a serial movie hero is all about.  Gordon Jones is well-cast as Britt Reid, acting in a manner that would not suggest his alter-ego, and using Al Hodge's voice for The Hornet is an interesting way to further disguise his identity.  Keye Luke had a long career in support roles and is effective enough in his occasional involvement in the action.  Anne Nagel as Lenore Case doesn't get to do much, except express her belief that the Green Hornet is not a gangster; Phillip Trent as reporter Jasper Jenks has a more active role.  Wade Boteler has the rather thankless task of portraying Michael Axford, intentionally annoying and not too bright, but that's how the character was in the radio show.

VCI's restoration is quite good, much improved over their earlier VHS edition, crediting Universal Studios and Universal Studios Home Video for making available original 35mm film materials.  Most of the serial has excellent image quality; sharp, with good gray scale and, perhaps the best improvement, the sound is rid of the distortion heard in their VHS edition, now clear with good high-frequency content and only a small amount of noise.  A few problems remain, one of which, from Chapter Two, is shown in the ""before and after restoration"" extra feature to have rather extreme vertical scratches and what looks like torn film pieced back together with tape.  The restored image has been ""pulled in"" to cover the damage, resulting in some dimensional instability for a few seconds, but still a good improvement.  The worst problem was in Chapter Nine, which is prefaced by a note explaining that the negative for the second reel had deteriorated, and an alternate print had to be used.  The image picks up some ""dirt"" and the gray scale isn't quite as good; there is some horizontal jitter and a little distortion in the sound, but these same defects were in VCI's VHS edition, and the DVD is still significantly better.  There are a couple brief pauses, apparently the layer-change points that were placed during the chapters instead of between them, but these are minor blemishes.  The later chapters even have the correct MPPDA certificate numbers in the opening titles, most of them easily read with the sharp image, and while some of the earlier numbers repeat, the titles are otherwise correct, the first three chapters having pictures of the main cast, the rest just the cast list.

In addition to the restoration example, the ""extras"" include an audio feature written by Clifford Weimer, a ""bio"" of George W. Trendle, and a ""photo gallery"" with 30-some still images, about half of which are from the film, the rest posters for the serial and images related to the radio program.  And illustrating how closely the serial followed The Hornet's origins are two radio episodes, ""The Parking Lot Racket"" from 31 October 1939, and ""The Highway that Graft Built"" (labeled ""The Highway that Graft Wrote"") from 3 October 1940.

While the serial is hardly a masterpiece, with many technical aspects well below what Republic was doing at the time, ""The Green Hornet"" is faithful to the original source.  VCI has provided an excellent edition, the image and sound quality make the serial itself seem better than it did in VHS releases.  The ""75th Anniversary"" edition with both serials is a bargain, but for those who already have ""The Green Hornet Srikes Again"" this 2009 edition is a good choice, especially since it includes the two radio shows.  It should be noted that VCI has lowered the price of the 2009 release, making it even more attractive than it was.",1316908800,3,5979,4.884272997032641
541772,5,6303004830,"Created by George Trendle and Fran Striker, The Green Hornet first came to popularity as a radio serial first broadcast in 1936.  The program featured Britt Reid, the youthful owner and publisher of a newspaper called The Sentinel, who dons a mask and secretly fights crime as the Green Hornet.  Reid is aided by his faithful valet Kato, who also wears a mask, and besides being an expert fighter, pilots the Hornet's superfast car, the sleek Black Beauty.

The Green Hornet typically took on `racketeers' involved in organized crime, and those who betrayed the public trust, like crooked officials or politicians.  Because of his close association with underworld figures, the Hornet was commonly thought to a criminal himself.  And since he took the law into his own hands, he was often sought after by the police.  As the radio program proceeded into the World War II years, the stories also incorporated elements promoting the war effort, and fighting espionage on the home front.

Serials were short multi-part features that were run in movie theaters, as supplements to the main feature, as enticements to return to the theater the following week.  The Green Hornet (1940) was a 13 part serial that featured Gordon Jones as Britt Reid.  The Green Hornet Strikes Again (1941) was a 15 part serial with Warren Hull as Reid.  This four disc DVD set contains the two complete serials, restored to the best condition possible.  Typically each episode runs a about 20 minutes, and begins with a summary of the story so far, and then ends with some kind of cliffhanger.  Keye Luke, known for playing one of Charlie Chan's sons, and later for appearing on the 70's TV series Kung Fu, plays Reid's valet Kato in both serials.  Kato is credited with inventing the Hornet's gas gun and customizing the Black Beauty.

The Green Hornet (1940) serial, covers the genesis of the character, and consists of a series of adventures.  Among them, the Hornet investigates builders using substandard materials, looks into shady dealings at a flying school, and battles racketeers involved in protection rackets and other shady schemes.

In The Green Hornet Strikes Agian (1941) the supporting cast returns, but Warren Hull replaces Gordon Jones as Brit Reed.  The format remains mostly the same, with the Hornet mostly battling racketeers, but the writing is generally much stronger and production values are better.  The serial opens with Reid on vacation in Honolulu, while back home at The Sentinel, the syndicate has managed to insert one of their men as Reid's replacement.  The storylines are fleshed out to feature some of the supporting characters.  Reid isn't involved in any romances, but there are more women are featured in the cast.

Unlike the 60's TV series, the Green Hornet wears a full faced mask in the serial, and has a habit of introducing himself by displaying a button with green hornet emblem.  In The Green Hornet, the voice of Al Hodge, the man who did the radio broadcasts, was dubbed in for Warren Hall when he put the Hornet's mask on.  While the Hornet's loud and distinctive manner of speaking works well on the radio, there are often times when some subtly is required, and the Hornet is hilariously shouting at the top of his voice threatening criminals or giving commands.  In The Green Hornet Returns, Gordon Jones' real voice was used as the Hornet.

In the radio program, part of Britt Reid's cover was to act kind of dumb and laid back, so he could disappear and become the Hornet, without people suspecting his secret identity.  In the serials, Reid is more crusading and is aggressively on the frontlines instead of his reporters, and doesn't worry too much about being suspected as the Hornet.  This was probably a good decision given the strong emphasis on action in the serial, where there is little time for the subtleties of character.  Given the change of Reid's personality from radio to the movies it may be unfair to say, but neither Gordon Jones nor Warren Hull seems quite ideal as Britt Reid.  Keye Luke isn't flashy, but having an Asian in an ethnic role was a plus.  Wade Boteler does a very good job of capturing the spirit of crusty Irish ex-cop Mike Axford.  Anne Nagel is also good as Reid's secretary Lenore Case, the Hornet's staunchest defender.

Coming from a completely different era, the Green Hornet of the 1940's will probably not be of much interest to those introduced to the character by the 2010 feature film starring Seth Rogan.  This set will probably be most appreciated by hardcore fans of the Green Hornet, lovers of classic movie serials, or old time radio buffs.

watch them (BOTH Serials are included -'The Green Hornet' and 'The Green Hornet Strikes Again')
so I put the afternoon on hold and started 'The Green Hornet'. I was nearly through it when my
wife came home.  She caught part of the last chapter, and wanted to see how they got to the last
chapter.  I restarted it, and I got to see it twice in one day.  It was AWESOME!!
  I waited until the next afternoon to view 'The Green Hornet Strikes Again'.  It too was AWESOME!
Busted,  she came home, during one of the final chapters, so we did the same thing.  Restart and
again, I got relive my childhood again.  Somehow life lived through the eye of a Kodak Brownie camera
is more fun than adulthood lived through the eye of a Digital Cannon Rebel.  I revel in the citizenship
of the Land of Imagi-Nation!  God's given it to us, expecting it to be used at appropriate times.
  I've treated myself to seconds and third helpings on both of the videos.  The Quality and sound are
excellent.  My only whine is having to go through the chapter closings and openings, but when I was young,
(55 to 60 years ago) the intros were necessary to re-engage the magic of the imagination of an 8 year-old
boy and restore the continuity of the story.
  ALAS, movies like these, aren't made any more.  Unrealism, unreality, sex, immoral behavior and utter
violence have all but destroyed the imagination needed to make a story live.  But if you like fun, a little,
by today's standards, 'dated special effects', and 'dated dialog', this is for you.  It's for the viewer who
would like to see life as it should be, rather than the way we've made it to be.  If you are, then you are
MY KIND OF VIEWER.  GET this and others like it, made in the same era (30's, 40's and early 50's).  Join me,
sit back and enjoy the time when HEROES were HEROES, drugs were for misfits, degenerates and gangsters, and
the bad guys ALWAYS got what they so DESPERATELY deserved.",1306454400,5,2027,4.430894308943089

541870,4,6303004830,"This classic cliffhanger is based on another classic from another,almost for-
gotten medium...""Old Time Radio"". That's the pre-sixties era of drama and
comedy shows broadcast(mostly LIVE) over network radio. The Green Hornet
came from the Detroit stable of WXYZ which included such other ""kid's ad-
venture fare as ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Sgt. Preston of the Yukon"".
All of these shows were spectacularly successful and soon made their way
to the big and small screens.
This particular serial is structured somewhat differently from most others
of the period. For one thing,every time Gordon Jones dons the Hornet's
mask,his voice morphs into that of the actor playing the role on radio at
the time(Jack McCarthy if memory serves).
It's an odd but effective device, and given the technical constraints of
dubbing at the time, the effect is dramatic as well as kind of off-putting.
Another aspect that sets this chapterplay apart is how the screenplay is
crafted so that each chapter leads into the next with nary a break in the
(almost) constant drumbeat of action,action,action.
Given the amazing speed at which these things were shot,it's more than a
little eyebrow-raising that the performances ever manage to rise above the
level of ""say your lines, hit your marks and don't bump into the Black Beauty"".
If your cliffhanger collection has a gap in it,this is the one to fill it.",1295481600,21,1381,5.034934497816594

Never mind it did,nt all those rockets and scaners or even a phone in it. It was all so very cool. Hey, what do you expect for the 1940 ,s ????  I also was surprised to see Kato use a Karate chop now and then in this one. Way before Bruce Lee was ever concieved. Very good . When I heard that a serial of the Hornet was made back in the 40,s I had to jump on it.....and I,m pleased I did.",1291680000,,863,3.9314285714285715
541872,4,6303004830,"Over the past few years, we've been swamped with a run of Super-hero and action movies that vary widely in their quality.  This generation of writers/directors, in most cases have attempted to re-imagine the characters to make more psychologically complicated to have them relate better to their audiences.  So Superman fathers a child in a one-night stand, Batman is willing to share his identity to his love and put her life in jeopardy, the Hulk's anger management issues come from parental abuse...

Let's go back to a time that was simpler.  Heroes were heroes and excited about heroing.  The most uncomfortable comment was Kato (Keye Luke) making it clear in his first lines of the first chapter that he was Korean (not Japanese) during this war-time serial.  Each 15 minute segment left you hanging for a week to see how The Green Hornet (Gordon Jones - Mike the Cop from Abbott and Costello fame) and Kato would progress to the ultimate (and only) conclusion - get the bad guys and put them away.  It really was that simple once...

VCI has done an outstanding job with this product.  I admitted to a VCI representative that I though they were simply a 'public domain knockoff' company, but, in many cases, they have produced high-quality, lovingly crafter products (look for The Green Hornet Returns and Weiss-O-Rama from their catalog, to name 2 more).  Decent print, clean transfer, liner notes - who could ask for more.

Sit back on a (series of) Saturday Afternoon(s) and spend less than half an hour to see a chapter with your kids and ask them - how the heck are they going to get out of this one???????

541963,5,6303004830,"The character of The Green Hornet first appeared on WXYZ radio, Detroit, Michigan on January 31, 1936, and was created by station program manager/co-owner George W. Trendle (who also created The Lone Ranger) and, was like that station's Lone Ranger, was primarily written by Fran Striker, during the early years of both programs. And Trendle's creation from the word go, but Striker was the one who came up with the gas gun and ""Black Beauty. ""Trendle created Britt Reid/The Green Hornet as the son of Dan Reid, the boy who called The Lone Ranger uncle.

The Green Hornet, like his legendary predecessor, fought crime wearing a mask; he carried a gas gun; he drove a fast car, ""Black Beauty"". The Hornet's sidekick was Kato, a Korean who doubled as his valet, and was a college graduate who knew all the secrets of Kung Fu, a master chemist and he could drive the ""Black Beauty"" with amazing skill. The opening-and-closing theme music, the Green Hornet opened with ""Flight of the Bumble Bee"" as it's theme music.

Universal studios acquired the rights to make two serials based on Trendle's ""Green Hornet"" character.
This one was Universal's 45th sound-era serial and they slipped it in between ""The Phantom Creeps"" and ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe."" Through thirteen chapters in this serial The Green Hornet manages to discover and eliminate a number of various criminal enterprises that are plaguing his city. Playing The Green Hornet in this version is Gordon Jones who was best known for being Mike the Cop on the Abbott and Costello show. Keye Luke plays his faithful sidekick and chauffeur Kato.

The premise here is that the various rackets are controlled by a city syndicate of twelve and the Green Hornet as himself and in his real identity of Britt Reid, millionaire publisher of a crusading newspaper the Sentinel, systematically exposes each racket in each chapter. He even has a gas gun that shoots small gas pellets and when they hit the target they merely disable. Fran Striker who created The Green Hornet also created the Lone Ranger and the Ranger's creed was always to shoot to wound. Modern technology has given the Green Hornet a weapon that will do nothing else. Watch for a surprisingly excellent cast:  Anne Nagel as Reid's secretary Lenore Case, Wade Boteler as the irrepressible Irishman Mike Axeford.  Incredible stuntman Dave Sharpe doubles for Jones in the action scenes and veteran radio performer Al Hodge provides the Hornet's voice.

Best part about this release is the liner notes.

541971,4,6303004830,"`The Green Hornet' is, overall, a pretty good serial.  Certainly it is a darn sight better than the superhero movies made since about, say, 2005, when suddenly Batman was willing to confess his true identity to a deputy DA just because he has the hots for her, or since 2006, when we learned that Superman was a dead-beat dad and a stalker (and don't get me started on the Fantastic Four or `Spider-Man 3': blech!).  `The Green Hornet' features a hero unencumbered by ridiculous modern angst and subplots, who is good in a fight, yet is only able to perform feats that actual human beings could conceivably perform.

This serial has a good plot, or rather a series of good plots, that are much more grounded in reality than most other serials.  It does not involve super-powers, magic, outer space, or super-villains.  It's about crime.  I myself enjoy the demented hallucinations of `Flash Gordon' or `Atom Man Vs. Superman' as much as the next person, but I like crime stories too.

This serial has decent fight scenes, not dazzling like `Spy Smasher,' but better than the average Columbia serial. The cliff hangers are generally good, with the average amount of `cheating' to resolve some of them.  There is a good sequence with the Hornet jumping from his car onto a moving train, and who doesn't like that?

To predict if you are going to like this serial, a lot depends on if you like the Green Hornet as a hero.  This serial is very faithful to the original radio show, even to the extent that whenever actor Gordon Jones puts on the Green Hornet mask, his voice is dubbed in by Al Hodge, who played the Hornet on radio and later went on to be the best Captain Video on TV.

I like the Green Hornet because he has a super cool gas gun to knock out crooks (the special effect for this action works well here) and has a super cool souped-up car to chase crooks.  Also, instead of wearing tights, he wears a suit and a hat, which looks a lot classier and certainly less sissy than superhero tights.

But now a word about Kato: in this version of Green Hornet, Kato is the one who invents the super cool gas gun and high powered engine that powers the super cool car.  In real life, a guy that smart would have patented those things and gotten rich from them.  Or if he gotten into the crime fighting business, he might have kept the gas gun and super motor secret so as to avoid them falling into the wrong hands, but certainly he would have invented other things and gotten rich from them.

Also, besides being a scientific genius, Kato is the one who knows martial arts.  The Green Hornet is pretty good in a fight, but a Judo expert would outfight him every time.

What I am getting at is that Kato should have been the main hero, and the Hornet should have been his sidekick.  My guess as to why the Hornet was dominant is that is something to do with the fact that Kato was not a Caucasian and Hollywood has been known to, from time to time, exhibit a little institutional racism.

To the credit of the writers, however, at least Kato was portrayed as smart, tough and valiant, rather than being a subhuman idiot or a satanic sadist (many non-caucasians were represented thusly by Hollywood at the time).  There are several instances in this serial when Kato saves the Hornet's butt.

Keye Luke, who played Kato in this and the 2nd Green Hornet serial, was a good actor who, while he never became a household name, worked steadily on a multitude of roles for about 50 years.  He played Number One Son in many Charlie Chan movies, and had small to medium-sized roles in scores of other films.  He was a constant guest star in TV shows of the 1960's, ranging from `My Three Sons' to `Star Trek.'

But my favorite role of Keye Luke's was his excellent portrayal of Master Po, the all-seeing yet blind teacher from TV's `Kung Fu.'  IMO, he was the coolest person on the show.  Strangely, the original concept for `Kung Fu' would have had Bruce Lee playing the hero.  Unfortunately some twit in Hollywood decided to hire David Carradine, who was pretty good, but still Lee would have been cooler.  Bruce Lee, of course, besides being a martial arts movie superstar, played Kato in the underrated TV version of the Green Hornet.

This video is a little blurry due to the age and decomposition of the original film stock, but it is not so bad as to distract a true movie buff, so don't be frightened by those who belly-ache about that.  Just don't pay more than $10 for this.",1202256000,3,4477,4.476600985221675
