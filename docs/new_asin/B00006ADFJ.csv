1736909,3,B00006ADFJ,"Paul & Josh are about to adopt Nikki; the son of a friend of Paul who died of cancer and willed, that Paul and Josh, a gay couple, raise her son; but her mother,(Nikkies grandmother) is challenging the will and attempting to thart the adoption and raise the boy herself.
A court in New Jersey has set a date in three days for the adoption hearing; and on his way home from work Josh witnesses a mob hit in a deli and then flees home in terror. Now the mob is after Josh and wants to rub him out so as not to rat out the hitman. Afraid to upset his partner Paul and to jeopardize the adoption of Nikki, Josh refrains from telling his partner and reporting the incident to the police. The mob send the son of the mob boss to ""silence"" Josh; a scuffle occurs in Joshes apartment and Josh pushes the assasin out the window and is killed from the fall. Now the mob boss wants revenge and has Paul kidna pped in an effort to lure Josh into an ambushed. theres a twist in the plot, and so I don't want to reveal the entire movie as not to spoil the ending, but Paul and Josh servive a shoot out and win custody of Nikki in the end.
The screenplay has potental, but didn't seem believable. this is due in part, at least, in my opnion, because it was written, produced, directed, and edited, by the same individual; and this causes a  lack of dimension.  What I did like is that Paul is an older man who is overweight and Josh is the younger good looking partner; this seemed to add more realism to the story; compared to say a couple of fit and trim hollywood pretty boys as lovers.
The movie was made in 1997; but the cinematopraphy appeared to be made from the 1970's and this distracts from the quality of this production; and the plot begs to be written in a more sophfisticated manner. The acting was good, but you get the feeling that the whole film needed a little more work; but by no means was it a failure.
The film promoters claims this as the first openly gay action adventure story. It is a genre worth developing.

Thanks for reading my review; I hope it was of some help to you.

Unlike many low budget films with an axe to grind, this movie tucked the axe into an interesting array of moderately paced action (as opposed to slow, which one might expect from an indie character-driven action movie), reasonably well crafted fight scenes (which, by necessity and perhaps good taste, relied heavily upon very slow motion and aggressive editing), and realistic, yet not boring, dialogue.  In fact, I think what held my interest was that the characters did what a fairly normal person would think of themselves as doing in similar circumstances.  One thing leads to another in a fairly acceptable way.  The limited budget was visible in the actual shots; but not to the degree that I found distracting or cheesy.  In all, I am impressed by what a great job they did on a trim budget.",1522195200,,854,4.743243243243243

7966251,4,B00006ADFJ,"Definitely good for a gay film.  The bad guys, not so great acting.  Some accents seemed a bit off.  The storyline was good and easy to follow.  Directing was mediocre.  The good guys did a great job!  Of course, how you could not like Troy Sostillio.  Damn, he's a hottie!",1472256000,,273,4.34
7966252,2,B00006ADFJ,"After reading previous reviews, I thought this movie sounded interesting, and I really wanted to like it. I knew it would be a low-budget flick, and I know what comes with the territory. It has some sound problems at times, but that's usually not a problem for me. Sadly, the enormous plot holes were almost enough to make me give up on this film after the first few minutes. The script called for some seriously unrealistic reactions by the main characters, in some very extreme situations, and they were enough to leave me shaking my head and/or rolling my eyes. There were also several long, drawn-out, contemplative scenes that could have been cut in half. After a while, I was tempted to just yell at the screen, ""We get the point already! Get on with the the movie!"" The only thing that saves this flick from complete failure is the relatively decent acting and likeability of the actors. I felt myself rooting for the characters, despite their seemingly absurd actions. I think most movie buffs would, however, feel ripped off by the unnatural behavior of the main characters that was necessary to keep the story from simply falling apart. This film will leave any  reasonable person asking the question, ""What were they thinking?"" If you really want to give this movie a shot anyway, be prepared to suspend your sense of disbelief several times before you get all the way through it.",1470787200,,1391,4.74793388429752
7966253,3,B00006ADFJ,The story seems unrealistic along with some of the character development/behavior. I did watch it to see how it ends but found myself fast forwarding because it seemed so absurd at times. Some of the parts seemed to be overacted as well.,1458604800,,237,4.666666666666667
7966254,4,B00006ADFJ,You can tell right away that this is very low budget and even though it was made in 1996 the filming techniques reminded me of movies that came out in the early 1970s. The movie kind of reminded me of the way Billy Jack movies were filmed and there was a lot of gun violence and blood.  The strange thing is that it worked for me and I liked it.,1441929600,,345,3.9285714285714284
7966255,5,B00006ADFJ,"I don't mind the silly, sassy, swishy gay characters that have populated Hollywood's TV and movie creations in the generations we have fought for 100% citizen's rights. But this film is a sign of the game change and tipping point created by an entire people coming out. This modern family and action drama puts Tarantino to shame, with its body-inclusivity and climactic shoot-em-up money scenes. Smoke 'em, girls!",1358294400,,414,5.102941176470588
7966256,2,B00006ADFJ,"The byline, ""This time the gay guy's got the gun,"" may be the only clever aspect to this movie. After watching this film I found the few reviews here on Amazon (which initially convinced me to give it a try) to be rather misleading.  In reality, this movie is just one step away from being awful.  The story line was widely implausible, and the majority of the actors were amateurish and flat.  Many of the filming angles in certain scenes were just bizarre.  The narration during the beginning and the end was merely compensation for poor story telling, and the violence (mostly unreal) seemed far out of character with the rest of the tone of the movie. The movie does depict a moment or two where the lead characters show heart, and for that reason I give it two stars.  But a successful ""gay action film"" this is not.",1327968000,3,821,4.483221476510067
