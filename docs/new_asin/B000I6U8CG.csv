8560505,1,B000I6U8CG,"What a fascinating story this would be if this video actually told it!  Instead, what the viewer gets is about five minutes of video about a guy the Lord seems to be punishing by making him do the AT--oh, and with said guy reciting verse by painful verse the words to the Amazing Grace hymn.  Nothing about planning, training, people he met along the way, adaptions for the hike, feelings, how he teamed with his dog, Orient.  Not even insights into Bill Irwin's spiritual experience along the way.  This is a corny and amateurish production.  And at just a few minutes long--about like a long music video--it felt like a rip-off, too.",1166832000,9,635,4.633928571428571
