8262217,5,B0016EB4T0,"I have Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia, Orofacial Neuropathy, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and Atypical Odontalgia.  I sometimes have Typical Trigeminal Neuralgia, such as electric pain shooting in my face. My Nerve Injuries were caused by inept dental assistant who stubbed my gum and teeth for 2 hours.  My pain has been quite intense.  This DVD focuses on the accupressure points in the face and head.  It truly gives some pain relief, and includes self-massaging technique.  If you have somebody who can massage you, he/she can follow the DVD, and you can save money in going to chiropracitcs or some other massagings. The language is in Chinese Mandarin; however there are some subtitles that you can read in English.  The sound of Chinese Language might be hard on your ears, so you might mute it and just visually follow what they are doing. Perhaps, while you're massaging or being massaged, you may play your favorite easy listening music or better relaxation.  It does not cure your orofacial neuropathy right away.  However, to calm down the pain and control the pain everyday, would definitely prevent pain's getting out of control.",1225065600,,1145,5.0855614973262036
