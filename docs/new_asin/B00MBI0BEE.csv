8671412,5,B00MBI0BEE,This is a very nice collection with a good plot and mystery to it. It really helped to have the second part to explain a lot of plot holes that didn't detract from the first story line but helped fill out the whole story even more.,1444694400,,231,4.043478260869565
8671413,4,B00MBI0BEE,"I truly love this show ever since I got it on DVD over this past summer. Veronica Taylor, ( orig. U.S. Ash Ketchum and May voices from the ""Pokemon"" anime series from 1998 to 2006, and Max from Sega Games co. from Japan, Dinosaur King"" anime show, nails her famed anime roles once again. This time as the female heroine,  Mutsuki. The characters Mito, Sabu, and Shin really make my funny bone laugh, medithoracally speaking. I'm happy that the first season was dubbed in English, though I do also wish the second season had an English dub as well. I totally recommend this TV series to anybody in pre-teen age.",1439424000,,610,4.545454545454546
