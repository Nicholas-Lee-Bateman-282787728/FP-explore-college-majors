8396111,4,B003FSTVDG,"This travelogue is about Bhutan. (No Myanmar footage at all.) Overall, it's a good glimpse of Bhutan, visually very nice, technically well done, but not quite factually correct, ascribing much of Bhutanese Buddhist actions to animist views. Theoretically, this is not true at all, though in reality, there may be some of that basis in the views of the Bhutanese people. The film also states that Nirvana is the goal of Buddhism. Most of Bhutan practices Mahayana Buddhism, which, in fact, has enlightenment as its goal, in which the practitioner vows to abstain from nirvana until all sentient beings are liberated. If one swaps the term ""liberation"" with the term ""nirvana"" in the film, it's more ""correct"", if there is such a thing in Buddhism in reality. Still, it's a nice little film, which focuses mostly on the people, a practice not happening nearly enough.",1426723200,,865,4.972413793103448
