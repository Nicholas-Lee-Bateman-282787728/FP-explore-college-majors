5890731,4,B00E51KKNC,"This is an eagerly awaited documentary about a very interesting musical legend.  I thought the movie was wonderful, but rented it via Amazon and it was very jumpy when we watched it.  I was very disappointed in the download/watching of the movie  ONLY because it is hard to watch something so musical when we had to wait for the video to stop skipping.",1377388800,,352,4.555555555555555
5890732,4,B00E51KKNC,This was an interesting look at one of my favorite musicians of all time. I would recommend it if you are a fan of The Band or of any of Levon Helm's work.,1377388800,3,155,3.727272727272727
5890733,5,B00E51KKNC,You can not help but love Levon for his work and who he is. The movie gives you a glimpse into how hard it was to be him. It some ways it is difficult to watch.  This is as real a documentary as you'll seel.  Amazing.  Worth all the money.,1376697600,11,239,3.74
5890734,5,B00E51KKNC,"A look inside the voice! You get to see a side of Levon like never before, from great concert footage to home life. A gritty chronicle of Levons last years that show you just how much a single man can change to history of music. Dont rent this title buy it, you will want to watch it over and over. Best film I have seen in years",1376524800,10,329,3.925373134328358
5890735,5,B00E51KKNC,Great. No other words. I was priviledged to attend a few rambles before Levon left us. This documentary is a great reminder of what was lost and how it should continue!,1376352000,21,168,4.451612903225806
5890736,5,B00E51KKNC,"We saw this film at SXSW in 2009?  Was really hoping it would come to a theater in Austin, TX but we'll take it whatever way we can get it!  Gives me chills just to type this review.  Levon was an awesome percussionist and had a great voice.  Thank god we got to see him in person before he passed.  If people don't know the story behind the Band, they will now!  Excellent movie! Looking forward to watching this Friday night with my husband!  Ramble on Levon!  Keep it Going!",1375315200,4,477,4.222222222222222
5890737,5,B00E51KKNC,"I can't wait to see this again and again when it releases on Amazon. I have pre-ordered it here but was lucky enough to attend a showing at Levon's barn in Woodstock earlier this year. Like the Midnight Rambles and the other shows they're still doing there, it was so moving and joyful that I know I don't remember all the details. It left me with a feeling of the fun and joy that Levon brought to his music and to the lives of so many people who were lucky enough to know him. It also gave a much deeper and more intimate look at his life, the things that guided him and the challenges he faced to live on his own terms.

Levon was blessed to have been surrounded by a lot of wonderful people who continue to love and honor him with their commitment to ""Keep it Goin'"". A lot of them appear in this film. After you see this and wish that you would have gone up to the barn to see one of his shows, browse to levonhelm.com and get yourself a ticket. The sequel to this film is performed live most Saturday nights.",1375228800,3,1014,4.121212121212121
5890738,5,B00E51KKNC,"Levon Helm lived a life in music, one that unfortunately ended too soon last year when he was 71 years old. But what a life! His career traced the entire arc of the rock and roll era, from his early years seeing Elvis, Sonny Boy and Bill Monroe as a kid in Arkansas, to his years on the road as a member of Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks, then leader of Levon And The Hawks, which became Dylan's first road band. Then The Hawks became The Band, the most respected band of the golden age of rock.

He played a decent guitar and a distinctive mandolin, but that voice! Levon was the voice of the American heartland, an iconic, craggy, lusty voice whether singing, acting and narrating, or just telling stories. And, oh yes, he was one the the very best drummers in the world. But his post-Band career, while artistically rich, left him ultimately broke, and in the late nineties cancer took his voice.

To pay the rent and medical bills, and just to play, he began hosting Midnight Rambles at his home in Woodstock, where he had a studio in his beautiful barn. Playing for a couple hundred people on Saturday nights, Levon came all the way back to the top, and along the way his voice came back. Sort of.

This beautiful and powerful documentary, filmed with Levon's full cooperation around 2008, finds him at home with his family and friends, learning of his nomination for a Grammy for his new album (he would win it, along with two more), laughing and telling stories with his friends and bandmates, and playing with some of the best musicians on the planet both in his barn and on tour. While the beautiful spirit and sheer joy of music certainly shine through here, the film is also unflinching in showing Levon struggling with a ravaged voice and being tested, rather unpleasantly, at a hospital, and making those closest to him cringe with his bitterness about the end of The Band and the subsequent demise of his dear friends Rick and Richard.

Ultimately, this film holds up in several ways. It is a gritty, effective ""fly on the wall"" style documentary; it is an interesting and instructive view of a Rock life; and if you went to a Ramble at the Barn, or just loved Levon for the national treasure he was, it will move you.

OK, I guess that's a thumbs up.",1375142400,96,2263,4.483009708737864
5890739,5,B00E51KKNC,"I saw this movie for the one weekend it was in Columbus. Even though we never met, it was great to see an old friend on the big screen. Even though I am younger than some of his albums, I still draw inspiration from him and how you need to be passionate about what you are doing. This movie is a great example of life on the road as well as dealing with personal issues that take us away from our work and love. If you want to know the man behind the music, watch this movie. #keepitgoing #play1forlevon",1375142400,5,503,4.090909090909091
5890740,5,B00E51KKNC,"If there ever was a need for something like air it would seem to Levon Helm its performing music. However, like love itself, the thing you thrive on can be a double-edged sword.  Thats kind of the gist one gets from watching I Aint In It For My Health.  Simplistically that could mean I would have simply chose another path if health was my objective.  What Levon chose was his passion for performing and creating music.  As a celebrated multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and performer hes certiainly earned his stripes.

Concentrating on the latter years of Levons life this film is not wholly celebratory.  Though surviving two of his bandmates Levon has paid a price in health as well as being in an industry known for casting aside those who were formerly on top.  Hes seen it all in a nutshell and its hardened him to which his later year health problems only compounded.  Throughout it all he did what his true calling dictated which was continue.  It certainly wasn't a smooth ride.

In watching this film you get a handle on how special The Band was when they weren't divided.  That didn't last when success finally arrived.  Like another great band, The Beatles, there might have been too much talent in one outfit to last.  The known turning point was when principal songwriter Robbie Robertson became the only recipient of writing royalties which in simpler times were spread among the various members no matter who was the primary contributor.  It could be more than that simple human emotion of jealously as most songs went through the aggression prior to the final recording?  Whatever the bottom line as who contributed what it was a divide that not even Dylan or Scorcese could mend although both contributed hugely to their legacy.

Legacy is a strange thing since in and of itself you cant make a house payment on it.  As we see in this film that was a constant problem for Levon.  With all his success he never made enough to be truly financially secure.  Thus not only did his muse keep him performing, but his monetary needs forced certain requirements upon him to keep on keeping on.  For the most part it would have been something hed likely wanted to do, only not on the sheer terms of survival.  Nonetheless we see a man of rare talent and charisma.  Even as he struggles with frailty he preservers.  The struggle definitely takes some of the unbridled joy of his youth away hough and its pretty evident.  Thankfully a man of his stature has affected many who rally to support him and he goes out with some belated adoration and support.  Simply put Levon Helm is an American Treasure to which this fine film makes clear among his trials and tribulations.  With his excellent Dirt Farmer album we were again graced with his musical genius, but one can only imagine what would have been had The Band not splintered so early in their heyday.",1486771200,,2863,4.676
5890741,5,B00E51KKNC,"I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to Levon after a Midnight Ramble years ago, having been acquainted with a member of his entourage through a Band message board. He autographed several items for me including his book and a copy of ""Jericho"". As a longtime fan I was awestruck and rendered speechless in his presence but he made it clear we were on a first name basis. All this was in addition to a fantastic performance earlier in the evening. He was in great voice that night. The stars were aligned. It was one of the greatest nights in my life.

I was so glad that this film so accurately documents his final years - the good and the bad. It is only fitting that his later recordings all won Grammy awards, even if he didn't care much for that process. A true southern gentleman to the end.

In the end Robbie got the money but Levon got the love and respect. (Not that I dislike or disrespect Robbie but I'm sure this fact is not lost on him.)",1485388800,,960,4.298342541436464

An American hero in the world of rock and roll. I am at a loss of words to describe how great this man was in Americana.
He is greatly missed to this day. Very moving. We have lost a great man.
Thank you Levon for all the great music, and movie parts, and mostly singing in one of Americas's greatest band's. He was the BAND!",1475020800,3,501,4.112244897959184

Even as his almost life long smoking habit was stealing his wonderful voice and his wonderful life he kept on living and making music the very best way that he could.  He is an inspiration to keep on doing what you love to do with the people you love, no matter what, for as long as you possibly can.  And this is a very good cautionary tale about the terrible dangers of smoking.",1470700800,,508,4.101010101010101

5890757,3,B00E51KKNC,"I couldn't wait to play this the minutes I got it for my birthday.  Levon is one of my drumming heroes.  For many Ringo was their man.  For me Levon was my Ringo.  After watching the film and processing it a bit I felt like it really missed the mark. I went from being jacked up to let down in 83 minutes.  Back of the case talks about the ""creative process"" on his comeback album.  Really the only thing I really got out of that was him and Larry Campbell working out a line to an old Hank song. Levon didn't seem to embrace the songwriting or the lyrics. It seemed all Larry Campbell. Often Levon would say a couple things and walk out or the room. It left me wondering if this is what he did in The Band? From beginning to end this film in my opinion lacked the depth I was hoping for.  I felt the film rehashed much of what we already knew about Levon. His financial situation has been well documented I am thankful they managed to keep the Barn. My biggest musical regret is not seeing a Midnight Ramble.  It really didn't dig into the mind of this great drummer/singer. He is a natural drummer, a gift to the world. He embodied honest from the roots up American music. It would have been awesome just to touch upon how he hears rhythm and creates drum parts. Drumming and singing were really what he was as a musician.  One question I would have asked is, ""Levon, what do the drums mean to you?"" This was one of the most important aspects of his life.  What I got out of this was some fun Levon stories. I also did learn that Levon really like his weed and loved to get stoned. I didn't know smoking pot was a big part of his life.  This was pretty much a constant throughout this film from growing to smoking to rolling.  I don't care and it probably helped him in the end. I started getting the waft (pardon the pun) that he was stoned pretty good throughout this film. At times I did feel like I was having a cup of coffee with an old friend. It  was nice to see and learn a bit about his past and his love of the farm . Levon expressed how he felt ripped off by Robbie. That was pretty much it on that - once again a rehashed story.  I would love to know exactly how Levon contributed to the song The Weight for example. I looked into it a bit and found many of the characters were people Levon knew and RR took those and wrote a song.  Regardless RR who still makes millions on these songs could have opened up his wallet to help those that brought his songs to life.  I guess if you are looking for a true documentary and to learn about this great singer and drummer you won't get it from Ain't In It For MY Health."" What you get is more a few days in the life  of Levon.  You get to see old  clips, most of which have been floating around for a long time.  You will see Levon and see him sing with his buddies and daughter and see him go to the doctors and get his throat scoped via his nose not once but twice. All sad and painful to watch. I felt Levon really didn't open up, reflect or possibly he didn't know how to and mostly kept up a protective mental barrier. I wish his daughter would have provided more insight and possibly busted his chops to let it all out. This film gives you a couple nuggets but not the mother-load.  There was a lot of time wasted on repeating several narratives in this film from the docs office twice, too a lot of little stories he liked to share.  Don't get me wrong they were fun to listen too and that's what he liked to do. I also felt in some parts of this that he sort of had to put on his game face and hit on a couple points that felt a bit contrived and set up when the camera was on him.  I was left confused and wanting more.  Part of me was left after watching the music credits and seeing Robbie R all over it that he was the man that actually conceived and wrote all those songs.  I'm not sure I even saw one Levon song credit?? No different then Paul McCartney  writng writing Yellow Submarine and letting Ringo sing it.  I was looking for songs written by Levon and the rest of the gang and found very few but some coowritten stuff outside after the Band.  On the other hand RR has a  lot solely credited to himself.  In a way I had the thought creep in that maybe he was simply bitter that Robbie made a shit-ton of money and he didn't. At the end of the day,  he was and, his daughter and bandmates are blessed to play music for a living utilizing much of the music written by Robbie Robertson and brought to life by Levon and the rest. YES. I do believe that they did contribute but am not sure how much. Did they write the lyrics and structure of the song?  I am confident that Levon made suggestions that we hear on Band recordings and deserved a cut. With that said, you would think that the other 4 members would have some reasonable management/lawyer back then to give them their due credit.  Those songs are what many want to hear and ultimately puts food on their table.  I would surely love to play music for a living.  Anyway, this film let me down big-time. Levon didn't let me down, the film did.  I wanted to give it five stars because it is about my drumming hero.  The content didn't really hit me in the gut like Levon's voice. I don't blame Levon. I wish more people could have convinced him to open up. I guess he was a stubborn old mule when it came down to it!  For me the best thing was seeing that big smile of his.  I am glad I got the opportunity to see him once at Red Rocks. He was obviously not well but managed to hit the crowd with that smile. That is all I needed.",1447632000,3,5561,4.085635359116022

Helm, battling financial and health issues, is captured backstage, on the bus, at the studio, and at home.  Throughout, Helm holds court as talk drifts from idle chatter and yarns (a lot of this) to jabs (also frequent) at the music business.  The film is sympathetic but it's not exactly a flattering portrait: Helm is glib when up, bitter when down, and sometimes in denial, as when he talks about bandmate Richards Manual's suicide.  All which is very sad-- I admire the music in the man (as one observer said, ""his drumming could make you cry""), but the man has the look of one who stayed too long at the party ... and wonders why he has a hangover.

5890801,4,B00E51KKNC,"Very little new information of Levon Helm was revealed. The footage of The Band was redundant. What was revealing was disappointing, mainly to hear Levon put The Band down so harshly. The problems within....the money, ""the suits"", the royalty struggles, etc are well known and unfortunate. Not many bands can keep their council the way The Dead did before Jerry passed, nonetheless The Band was one of the most vital and incredible music contributions to ever come out of American music and really are the fathers of American root music. It would have been good to hear Levon recognize this and take his award for this contribution. Levon accuses many of being sellouts, but in some ways his withdrawal and stubbornness was a sell out as well.

5890804,5,B00E51KKNC,"The story of The Band has been told many times: The Last Waltz showed how they could be themselves and still make the greatest musicians of their time shine as a back-up band, Elvis '59 tells Levon's story with Elvis', The interview on The Band Is Back about Sonny Boy Williamson, The Authorized Autobiography of The Band and his finale Love For Levon filmed at among other venues Madison Square Garden.
Listen closely and you will discover that Levon ((AKA Lavon) used to sit on the floor as Sonny Boy Williamson broadcast King Biscuit Time in Helena Arkansas across the river from Friar's Point MS as a child During his high school days he encountered the son of Mr. Jenkins, one of the captains of the Friar's Point MS/Helena AR ferry (and the father of another person who grew up in Marvell AR/Turkey Scratch AR -- Harold Jenkins who became Conway Twitty). Conway Twitty started as a rockabilly artist and waited for Levon to graduate High School to join him on the road as his drummer. Turkey Scratch (Pop. 70) was also the birthplace of Robert Lockwood Jr., Robert Johnson's stepson and only guitar student.
Levon was the only American among the members of Arkansas transplant Ronnie Hawkins' rock band which ruled Yonge Street in Toronto. Had rockabilly lasted another year, Ronnie Hawkins would likely have been its star after Elvis when into the Army.
Ironically both Robert Lockwood Jr. and Levon Helm won their first Grammies near the end of their lives.

However, as I watched this and began to enjoy some behind the scenes footage, I could not help but conclude that this video was a nuisance to him, or at least seemed it. One can tell his heart isn't really into the documentary. He is bothered by the cameras and appears like his privacy is being invaded. Some of the scenes appear to really be forced and uncomfortable. I did like it, but felt guilty because I didn't feel as though I belonged peering into his private life. There are some tough and very personal moments. Anyone who knows about Levon knows he doesn't do much he's not in agreement with. This film gives me a chill and great sense that he is doing something he doesn't want to. Under different circumstances, I'd say 4 stars, but a gut feeling I have that someone held his hand to the fire leads me to the ranking of 2 stars.

I loved the Band's music and think Levon was a fabulous drummer and superb singer. To the extent that one hopes to get to really know the person one knows only through a media filter, this film delivers a pretty straight ahead portrait of a man who was pretty straight ahead. The sense that what you saw was what he was is pretty much confirmed here.
Its a sobering unblinking look at illness, dying, perseverance and a man in some ways trying to come to terms with the vagaries of existence.
At one time the Band was one of the most popular Rock & Roll groups in the country, and imo certainly the best white band this country (or Canada) ever produced. They must have made untold millions.
Here we come upon Levon whose medical expenses have driven him to the brink of home foreclosure, (if it can happen to him, who's safe?) and one can't help but wonder how the hell that happened?
Well it apparently is all in the song publishing rights and Robbie Robertson got most of those. Levon is justifiably bitter.

5890829,4,B00E51KKNC,"""See that storm over yonder
It's gonna rain all day
But then the sun's gonna shine
Through the shadows
When I go away"". Levon Helm

Levon Helm is a name that is well known. He has become one of the most well known of 'The Band', the musical group that overtook the '60's. They split as a group, and as, Levon says in the film, ""It was all over after the second album"". There are bits and pieces of 'The Band' and their songs, but not too much is said about the group. Levon waxes about his lost comrades, and elicits some mention of Robbie Robertson, though not by name. Levon is still angry and hurt that Robertson made all the money from the groups albums with his name as the writer of the songs, all song writer royalties went to him. Levon and Robertson never made peace over this.

This film shot in 2010 film gives us a peak at Levon Helm recording a new album and talking with his old friends at his home in Woodstock, N.Y.. The film switches from Levon having procedures in the physician's office for his raspy voice, which we know now showed a cancerous throat lesion that killed him in 2012. We see him with band members, his family, his daughter, who gave birth to his grandchild during the making of this film. We also see his homestead, the farm and the farmers who run the farm. Levon talks a little about his growing up in Arkansas and working on his parent's farm, just waiting to get out.

A large portion of the film revolves around Levon's Grammy nomination for his album, 'Dirt Farmer'. He and the other members of 'The Band' were given a Career Achievement Award by the Grammy's. Levon did not want to attend, he felt the nomination for the Career Award was all business and not for his talent. His album, 'Dirt Farmer' did win a Grammy, and we see him and his family celebrating at home in Woodstock.

As the film progresses, we can see that Levon is failing, coughing a lot more, looking more anorexic, but still living his life. Several interviews with his wife and daughter reveal a little more about Levon. We see 'The Rambles', a weekly Sat night show Levon and his group produced in an old barn on his property. One way of making money and showcasing his talent, the financial burdens he faced were always on his mind.

This is a terrific film to showcase some of Levon Helm's talent, and to give us a behind the scene look at Levon, his love of music, his family and his life.

5890830,5,B00E51KKNC,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. Being a longtime fan from the beginning I've enjoyed every stage of Levon Helm's career. 'Ain't in it for my health' fills in many blanks of Levon's final years.
First, this film is not made to be loved and enjoyed by the masses but is rather a very personal look into his home life, his friends, and creating music. It is particularly interesting to view Levon and Larry Campbell at work trying to complete an unfinished Hank Williams  song. Notice it was Campbell who did the work and Levon who fleshed out the melody.
Many thanks to Kino Lorber for taking the risks for this project as I'll cherish my copy forever.",1381968000,,659,4.584745762711864

It seemed to be mostly about his failing health and the hardships endured as a result than a chronical of his music.  I just hated seeing the pain and torture Levon endured as a result of his cancer.  It would seem to me that the moments focused on in this movie would be considered private to most people of any modesty.  Since this is the only documentary I know of that focuses on Levon, I was troubled to see him portrayed this way inside of focusing on his music and the influence he had on other musicians.

5890839,3,B00E51KKNC,"The Band is probably one of the most unique collections of musicians but most of all it was a collection of eclectic personality. Yes Robbie Robertson gets to wear the egotistical devil horns in most media reviews and documentaries, but Levon Helm's got his stubbornness broadly on display. With his Celtic, grudge-holding lineage at his core, Levon's end of life could've been more joyful but he chose to righteously grasp and wrestle the demons that he felt tortured him and maybe other members of The Band. Too bad! I found his story to be very sad but it was wonderful to watch the people around him build bridges to support his musical talent. I just wish Levon Helm would have understood that life in martyrdom is a lonely place.",1379635200,4,735,4.705426356589148

5890843,5,B00E51KKNC,"This documentary accomplishes something rare in a biographical story: it is uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.  Watching Levon simultaneously struggle with illness while continuing to live and love life and create and perform beautiful music is powerfully inspiring.  Listening to the stories about the dark side of his history with The Band was heartbreaking, and the filmmaker gives us a nuanced look at how Levon deals with his legacy with pride, but also with some bitterness about the music business.  In his unguarded moments, we can see that Levon is still heartbroken over the loss of Richard Manuel and Rick Danko, and the interview sequences with Rick's widow are a brilliant juxtaposition that meshes Levon's story with the demise of The Band and the era in which they breathed rarefied air.  I thank the filmmaker for this heartwarming portrait, and I treasure this intimate record of a slice of the life - and tragic death - of a man and musician I have always admired and respected.",1378166400,42,1007,4.940828402366864

Plagued by a battle with cancer, he did not get bitter or fold, he doubled down, enlisted friends and created a musical tradition in his Rambles -- concerts staged at his barn with a coterie of music's best (un)known stars. He also shed light on the reality of a legend past shelf-life, the realities of catastrophic health issues and the realm of those who won't give in.

5890846,5,B00E51KKNC,"Nobody, however skilled, can make a decent documentary about an individual, band or indeed event, if the subject matter doesn't create a fascinating story. However in the case of Levon Helm this was surely the director's least concern - indeed it would be difficult to make a bad film about this fascinating musical maverick. But in the hands of the previously unknown Jacob Hatley - clearly a man destined for big things - the incredible story of Levon and his music is treated with finesse, skill and feeling to create possibly the best music documentary to emerge this year.

There are now 3 classic documentaries available that tell the story of The Band or members thereof and which all fans of this American institution should be sure are in pride of place in their collections.

8601308,2,B00E51KKNC,It's borning.... there is a couple of decent moment in the documentary but all in all it ain't that entertaining....

That's Show Biz..... so unless your a completest..... not recommended.,1509408000,,313,4.709090909090909
