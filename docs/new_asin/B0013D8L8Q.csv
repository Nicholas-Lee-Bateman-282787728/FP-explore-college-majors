3102925,2,B0013D8L8Q,"""Aces N' Eights"" (the title has nothing to do with the story, BTW) revives the old chestnut about the railroad forcing landowners off their property, spiced up with names like Ernest Borgnine (as the most stubborn homesteader), William Atherton (as the nasty railroad bureaucrat, naturally), Casper Van Dien and Bruce Boxleitner (both quite good as gunmen who develop consciences) and Jeff Kober (looking eerily like Denis Leary as the most bloodthirsty of Atherton's men). A minuscule budget and pedestrian direction (by Craig R. Baxley) does the film in, with poorly-staged action scenes, continuity problems, and an annoying reliance on tight close-ups.

Thank goodness the rest of the cast is just as good in this surprisingly vicious and bloody western. Jack Noseworthy has a lot of good scenes as the railroad surveyor trying to bring the Wild West into the Gilded Age (shades of Gene Hackman in Unforgiven). Casper Van Dien takes the reins as the leading man, with Jeff Kober gleefully shooting everything in sight. (Sadly, he has no sympathy for his tired stooges, who have to bury all the innocent folk he pointlessly dispatches.)

Women don't have much to do in this production, but that is the western tradition and the director doesn't want to mess with that. The giant climactic battle has a number of great surprises near the end, including a big surprise as to who gets the final shot in the battle. The title of the movie is explained by Boxleiter's character during the movie, and will be familiar to viewers of the Deadwood television series.

This is a true western in the grandest Hollywood tradition, with modern bloodshed that would make Jason Statham wilt. A great way to spend an evening, as Ernest Borgnine rides off into the sunset. (Unless he has another western in him.)",1333843200,6,1244,4.75462962962963

When the main character Luke, played by Casper Van Dein, came onto the screen, it seemed to me that all of his scenes were small and they disappeared quickly.

Stuntman/action director Craig R. Baxley helms this exciting B-movie horse opera with flaw to spare. The color photography constantly thrusts you into the thick of the gunfire and the handheld camera work lends a versimilitude to the action that enhances this oater. Casper Van Dien is actually tolerable for a change and the beard gives him a lot of maturity.  Late in the action, he puts on a poncho and vaguely resembles Clint Eastwood. Basically, Van Dien plays a gunslinger who has tried to hang up his six-gun and reform himself. Naturally, the villains compel him to strap on his hog-leg one more time.

This is story about a railroad man using force to obtain right-of-way when his ""low-ball offers are refused.  . Ernest Borgnine and some other landowners refuse to sell.  Ernest Borgnine plays what, IMHO, is his best role and is deserving of some award, but probably won't get it.  Bruce Boxleithner plays a tough gunslinger for hire. I don't know if they intentionally did his teeth that way, but it looks authentic.  It never did makes sense to me for movie stars to have bright white teeth in the movies if they were playing an adult from yesteryear.

Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, I enjoyed the movie,but then again, I watched it for free.  Recommended for fans of Ernest Borgnine, Bruce Boxleithner and westerns.

8249823,5,B0013D8L8Q,"This is an excellent western made for cable TV movie. It was originally aired on the Hallmark Movie Channel in 2007 starring Casper Van Dien, Bruce Boxleitner, and Ernest Borgnine. The movie is not rated but has plenty of action and grit. It is the equivalent of a PG-13 theatrical movie with some scenes that are too intense for young children. The story is about a railroad that is spreading across the land and the ruthless tactics used to grab land from the ranchers whose land lies in the path of the railroad. Without any law and order to be found, justice falls on the shoulders of an elderly rancher and an accomplished, but retired, gunslinger. For 87 minutes of exciting western drama and action, you will want to add ACES'n EIGHTS to your DVD movie library! I give this movie a full five star rating! It is really that good!",1473552000,,835,4.5364238410596025

8249825,5,B0013D8L8Q,"The phrase ""aces and eights"" refers to the cards that Wild Bill Hickok held in his hand when he was shot in the back.
In this film there are two old-time acquaintances, both having been gunmen, one not doing it any more. They are on the two sides of a conflict. The retired gunman, as in most westerns, is on the good side.
There is also a girl who is attracted to the good gunman and he to her but, as in most westerns, he does not want to have her marry a gunman.
The railroad wants to build track on land belonging to various frontiersmen and want to pay only a small price for the land. The local railroad man hires vicious cutthroats to force the men to sell. The cutthroats murder both men and women, as well as children and ranch hands. Ernest Borgnine - looking very old - does not want to sell. He spent decades working and improving his land. He hired the good gunman - not as a gunman but as a land worker.
Matters get out of hand and the good gunman needs to decide if he will pack his gun again, and the acquaintance needs to make decisions as well.",1464652800,2,1062,4.1352657004830915
