8644790,5,B00IRLAQ80,"Yet one more excellent resource from Apologetics Canada.

For both helping believers launch the process of asking and answering life's big questions, as well as guiding those who are searching through the murky waters of life purpose and the path(s?) to truth, I can think of no better option than the Thinking Series.

I for one will be looking forward to more from Apologetics Canada!",1408406400,,386,4.923076923076923
8644791,5,B00IRLAQ80,"Get this resource if you are a Christian pastor or teacher and are trying to help people understand why we have good reasons to believe that Christianity is true.

The vignettes that start each of the five sessions are brilliantly made and tell really captivating stories to get participants interested in the topic at hand.

I'd encourage you try this resource out. It will help thinkers believe and believers think.",1407801600,,417,4.942857142857143
8644792,5,B00IRLAQ80,"This is a great series to engage skeptics, seekers, and Christians (regardless of their level of spiritual maturity) with the truth claims of Christianity through responding to some of lives toughest questions. Andy Steiger's teaching is clear, concise, compelling and thought provoking. This video series is perfect as a launching pad into deeper discussion and exploration of these important topics. I highly recommend it for churches and individuals to use.",1407628800,,460,5.585714285714285
8644793,5,B00IRLAQ80,"I used this highly produced video series with 30 students in the apologetics classes I teach at my Bible college. I also used it at my church home group setting with a group of 10. In each setting, the groups loved it!! Each of the videos and teaching sessions clarified and reinforced key concepts I had been urging the students to embrace. It also provided a perfect transition into my lecture or discussion as it introduced the topic and got into some depth in such a short amount of time.

I especially appreciated the passion and the quality content that Andy brings to the teaching sessions. Its refreshing to have both energy and insight at once.

It is not only suitable (and strongly needed) for any type of church or youth group setting (bible college, home groups, Tuesday morning women's sessions, etc) but it is suitable for outreach efforts to the non-Christian who is willing to watch. I guarantee that if the non-Christian takes one of these home or is given the video as a gift, he will come back with his thoughts provoked and his heart a bit more open to considering reality and truth of God.

Its a perfect pre-evangelism tool for friends and even that pesky family member.

Lastly, about the quality of the short films...can't get any better. Shot on location in the Nepal for some of them really well done. They hired a professional film company to make them and they did a great job!!!",1406678400,,1408,4.62
8644794,5,B00IRLAQ80,"This is a fantastic resource for small groups or personal growth. The professional production quality with concise yet solid teaching by Andy makes The Thinking Series a must-have in anyone's video library. The free resources on the website is great for anyone who wants to host these sessions in churches, coffee shops, or elsewhere.",1406592000,,334,5.203703703703703
