7944853,1,B00005M205,"Having got this fine production of Hansel and Gretel I find it is regionally not suited to my dvd player. Plays on the computer o.k. but if you are selling to Australia, surely a dvd that was produced in Australia would be capable of being played on and LG bluray machine. Alas not. Can anything be done short of resending a copy with the correct region. one it.",1402099200,,362,4.338235294117647
7944854,4,B00005M205,"We immediately realize that this in not a traditional Hansel and Gretel, when we see Hansel playing with his yo-yo, and his stepmother in hair curlers, smoking a cigarette.

But don't let this scare you off.  It's just a performance that may be better for adults, or at least for those who enjoy non-traditional versions.  I wouldn't recommend it for small children who might be frightened by the witch's brandishing a large kitchen knife, and then there's also the witch's meat-grinder with a human hand sticking out of it.  The witch also samples some of the raw ground meat coming out of the meat grinder.  It just might bother some small kids--others might love it.

After the warning for small children, there are several good things to say about this production:

1. It's done in English, which may be preferable for folks used to hearing only the German.  It's nice to hear the witch chirp, ""Come Little Mousey;  Come and see my Housey.""

2.  The Sandman brings not only somniferous sand, but also a colorful quilt for the kids to sleep on.

3.  The Dew Fairy and her attendants are entertaining in their cute tutus and thick, Coke-bottle glasses--makes them delightfully awkward!

4.  (and this is what really makes this production worthwhile:)
  During the dream pantomime, the children's dead mother appears and (wordlessly) assures them that she loves them.  (This would be excellent for teaching kids to cope with the loss of a loved one.)  Their mother doesn't want to leave them, but an angel urges her along and she just has to leave them.  This is all synchronized just right with the heavenly music.  --an extremely good addition to the Hansel and Gretel story.

It is well-sung, and well-acted, and has some nice special effects.  If you're a bit tired of the traditional Hansel and Gretels, then this just might be the kind of ""different"" performance you'd enjoy.",1163548800,,1882,4.830721003134796
7944855,3,B00005M205,"Same beautiful music. Same words (more or less).  It's amazing how different scenery can totally change a story.

The opera opens with the children doing their homework.  When the mother walks in with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth (to the laughter of the audience), it was clear that we weren't going to be spending any time in Germany's black forest.

That was okay with me.  I was intrigued and was rather looking forward to a modern ""city version"" of Hansel and Gretel.  But I was a bit disappointed with what followed.  It wasn't a ""city version"".  I don't really know what it was.  After the opening kitchen scene I could no longer identify the setting.  It wasn't a forest.  It wasn't a city.  And with that confusion and loss of continuity my interest waned.

I've seen the Metropolitan Opera DVD dozens of times and think it is magnificent.  I think there could someday be a modern version (with a looser translation), but this one lacks clarity in its storyline.  Had I not seen the Met version and known the general story, I'm afraid this Australian Opera version would have been totally mystifying. I'm happy that the Sydney Opera House had the audacity to do this.  I only wish the production had been thought out more clearly.",1102982400,9,1246,4.646788990825688
7944856,4,B00005M205,"Clever scenic design, and a top-notch Hansel highlight this decent Australian Opera staging of the Humperdinck classic.  The dream ballet sequence veers from the tried and true by beautifully depicting the children's dead mother in a heartbreakingly lovely moment.  Those hoping for an ornate, mouth-watering gingerbread house may be disappointed, but the slice of birthday cake served up by designer Mark Thompson gets high marks from me, especially since it cleverly harkens back to the afore-mentioned dream ballet.  The costumes range from the inspired (The kooky Dew Fairy sequence) to the dreadful (The low-rent children's theatre Sandman sequence).  Elijah Moshinsky's stage direction offers up some wonderful moments, particularly for Elizabeth Campbell in the normally thankless role of Gertrude, played here by Campbell as a chain-smoking drudge.  Sadly, video director Virginia Lumsden is not on the same directorial page as Moshinsky and often misses the mark with camerawork that generally stays too tight when expanse is begged for (i.e. the final chorus).  Suzanne Johnston is absolutely perfect as Hansel - boyish and boundlessly energetic.  Feistily looking through his (her) glasses, Johnston struts surely through a role that too often comes off forced, all the while sporting an excellent mezzo.  Singing in a clear but sometimes top-heavy voice, Christine Douglas is as cute as a jiggly plum pudding as Gretel, gamely keeping up with Johnston and successfully avoiding the cliche that comes too easily when adults portray youth.  Margaret Haggart seems a tad uncomfortable as the Witch, but when she trusts her director and really commits to the character, she comes shining through, both vocally and acting-wise.  I far prefer Haggart's smug take on Rosina Daintymouth to the mugging tongue-lashing Rosalind Elias offers on the Met DVD.  Malcolm Donnelly is a nicely grizzled Peter.  The children's choir seems a tad under-rehearsed, but they are energetic and not as much the scenery they usually come off as.
Johannes Fritzsch conducts well throughout. Although I always prefer the original German, the opera here is performed in English in a good translation.
For a more traditional take on this beloved (and underrated) classic opera, you'll be happier with the Met's warhorse version. But those more familiar with the piece will find many pleasures in Moshinsky's sometimes beautiful, sometimes quirky, always intelligent directorial choices and in Johnston's superb Hansel.",1063497600,7,2501,5.5013054830287205
