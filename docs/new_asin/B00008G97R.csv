1846043,5,B00008G97R,"""Come on, lets get him!!!"" Flyin Ryan is a totally trippy film. It's about a tinny poor kid that gets a magic pair of heelies tht grant him the ability to fly. He moves to a new town and he doesn't even own a skateboard. Mean, spoiled, rich kids, who own skate boards, are always pestering him and they push him into a lake and then Ryan somehow floats 20 feet out into the lake. ""Are you having fun yet?"" Sorry if this seems confusing but ""my brain must of got a little water-logged in the lake."" Ryan and his girl paddel all the way across the biggest lake in california to buy some wheels in an old town. Also ryan flys to, and breaks into a factory to save his dog. Then he ecscapes using a rope. A black belt in karate kicks a kid in the chest, jumps over a motorcycle, and then catches a tenis ball all in a row. It was awsome! Dirk is the best bully I've ever seen in a movie. You have to watch out for the crazy aunt, shes always steling things. It's because she's poor. And also watch for Tobys' magic shirt that changes during the first chase. I am very confused about the many incoherant scenes that would randomly pop in and out. I got to go, ""I'm going to take this box upstairs.""",1057881600,9,1193,4.102564102564102
1846236,4,B00008G97R,"This movie is so hilarious precisely because it is the worst ""B movie"" I've ever seen in my life!  I picked this up b/c of a name association with a friend a few years ago at my local video rental.  Twice.  Recently I wanted to show it to my husband and kids since they share my sense of humor.  I couldn't find it to pick up anywhere.  How glad I was to find it at such a low price on Amazon.  It certainly wasn't worth anymore than a token price!  But still - I'm so glad I own it.  Oh boy - if you love to laugh at an honest attempt at movie-making gone really bad - awful acting, terrible script, can you even call the effects ""special""?!  lol  This is a movie you've just got to waste (and I do mean ""waste"") an hour and a half of your life on.  Much more fun when watching with others.  Gotta love it.",1274140800,,807,3.9135802469135803

1846238,1,B00008G97R,"I can't believe how bad this home movie was, bad acting, bad script, bad bad bad.  Whoever gave this movie 5 stars has to be related to the producer of it. I can hardly bring myself to watch the last 3/4 of the movie, it makes me want to vomit.  Even my kids think its bad, one star is being nice. I'm bummed that I spent $8 on hiring it from the video shop.",1225411200,,358,3.824324324324324
1846239,5,B00008G97R,"Flyin' Ryan is a kids movie that takes place in a small town and I liked it. The lead is a 10 year old boy ""Ryan"" who moves in with his wacky great Aunt Rita. She's a trash picker and what she brings home one day are shoes that will eventually be filled with flying magic wheels.  The bully skateboarders make life tough for Ryan but with his friend Nicki, he learns how to cope and he even rescues a stolen dog.  Flyin' Ryan is a kids' movie and my kids love it.",1147651200,,463,3.967741935483871
1846240,1,B00008G97R,"If I had not read some of the reviews I would have thought I had watched a totally different movie than has been descripted.  I laughed out of control for every bit of 10 minutes after reading some of the reviews.  My 4 year old son started laughing with me and he didn't even know why we were laughing.  Who would of ever thought a Friday night at home reading movie reviews on Amazon.com could be so fun.  Read them all - you'll see my point.  Ok now why I am writing the review.
My son appeared to like the movie however my husband and I thought it looked like a first time producer shot the film.  The plots jumped around, the acting was rather poor, and it appeared to be filmed using a home video camera.  It was enough to have to watch it once and is certainly not worth the asking price. Sorry, I don't like to give bad reviews but this one asked for it especially after I saw the price - spend your money on something better.  The laugh was worth the price though.",1133481600,2,973,4.138297872340425
1846241,5,B00008G97R,"Flyin' Ryan is great fun.  I have two young children, ages 5 and 7 and there aren't many movies I feel right about showing them.  Flyin' Ryan was fun and had a good story to tell. Yes, it is for young kids, with lots of animals, a fantasy adventure and a bully.  Andy Weiss is the lead actor and he is great. So is the bully ""Dirk"".

This movie isn't all Hollywood. The movie takes place in a small town - and it looks like a real small town.

Flyin' Ryan is an indie film for YOUNG KIDS - like Napoleon Dynamite is for teenagers.",1131062400,2,530,4.0095238095238095
1846242,5,B00008G97R,"Havin fun yet?...I sure did when i watched the emotional thriller Flyin Ryan! This could possibly be the best movie of 2000, case closed! Not only was the cinematography mind blowing but it also had an all star cast including: the talented Andy Weis, the very FINE Geneve Rupert, and my man Jacob Peterson  who played Dirk...WANT ME TO GRIND YOUR FACE IN MCGUIRE! Woooooooooo he even made me scared! All I can say is I smell a sequeal, Flyin Ryan goes Hawaiin!",1088812800,13,460,4.542168674698795

7983667,5,B00008G97R,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE FOR YOUR CHILD IT IS SO BAD but the kinda bad that keeps you and a bunch of drunk friends totally engaged the entire way through just there are so many baffling decisions.  Why is the aunt weed-whacking at night on an obvious set?  Why did they hire the whiniest child actor to play the lead role?  Who looked at these effects and was like ""yeah looks good""?  Why is anything happening in this movie? Bike reflectors can let you do that?)  Also a directors commentary EXPLAINING THE DECISIONS

100% worth the $4 i spent will have many viewings",1450224000,,565,4.384615384615385
7983668,5,B00008G97R,"What can you say about Flyin' Ryan that hasn't been said. Did director Linda Shayne know, before beginning production, that her magnum opus would propel her to the ranks of Spielberg, Tarintino, and Nolan? Did Andy Weiss, who plays Ryan, know that his spectacular performance would be loved by millions, but ignored by the Academy? Did Geneve Rupert, Ryan's love interest in the film, predict being compared to amazing actresses like Scarlett Johanssen, Angelina Jolie, and Meryl Streep? The antagonist, Dirk, easily overshadows other cinema villains like Hannibal Lector, the Joker, and that guy from Skyfall. Flyin Ryan is not a movie. Calling it that is an insult. It's a work of art. The flying effects make the special fx of Interstellar weep. The flying sequences in Flyin Ryan make Man of Steel's look like a high school production. It's a tragedy Flyin' Ryan never got the sequel it so deserves. In fact, it deserves a Marvel-esque cinematic universe. I have a few ideas for movies in the universe
Flyin Ryan 2: Age of Dirk
Flyin Ryan 3: The Winter Theo
Flyin Ryan and Nicki: Civil War
Flyin Ryan: The Force Awakens

Perhaps Disney could buy the rights to Flyin Ryan, and give the franchise the attention it deserves. 5 stars",1445385600,3,1233,4.843601895734597
7983669,5,B00008G97R,"This film, dare I say masterpiece has earned every single star in this 5 star rating.
This critically acclaimed, Oscar nominated emotional thriller will take you on the adventure of a life time. The entire 84 minutes I was glued to the TV. Ryan, the deepest soul ever captured in cinema will make you laugh, and he will make you cry. Flyin' Ryan has touched the hearts of millions, and his relatable story about being bullied will show all the poor kids out there dealing with their own Dirk, that if you believe hard enough, and you have a weird aunt to give you Heely's she found in the trash, you will literally, not metaphorically, literally fly away from your problems and everyone will like you. After seeing this film I actually bought stock in the Heely's shoe company, that's how much I believe in Flyin' Ryan and his message.

I recommend anyone feeling lost in their lives watch this film. You will find yourself in the soulful gaze of Flyin' Ryan.
And whenever you are feeling alone, look up at the stars, because Flyin' Ryan is there, and he believes in you.",1443830400,7,1071,4.549222797927461

7983675,1,B00008G97R,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Very poor acting throughout. While there is a plot, it is very amateurish in its development. The events are about as unrealistic as you can get. Don't get me wrong. The idea of a kid with flying shoes is fine with me, but the writing and direction made it seem like this was done by a couple of 10 year old kids. After destruction of private property, vandalism, and assault, nobody calls the police, only 911 to have the aunt taken to the hospital. This movie had the potential on so many levels to be so much better. Save your money and your time. Skip this one.",1313539200,,604,4.307017543859649
