7038293,4,B00UGPTP1Y,Was not as animated as I thought it would be!  I just took a college course covering Mark Twain (Sam Clements) and re-read Twain's publications and wanted to perhaps get a better understanding of his public performances.  I assume Holbrook researched Twain's speaking mannerisms as part of his preparations. I felt Holbrook helped me with more insight into his personality.  I am pleased with my purchase!

7038311,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"This recording is a true delight to listen to. It brings Hal Holbrook's greatest Impression of Mark Twain to life.  Year ago, I had the opportunity to be on board the Mississippi Queen Riverboat. A ship with a large red paddle wheel on the aft. All done up in lace carved woodwork with red and gold trim, the ship was an America dream on water. The entertainment included Hal Holbrook fresh off of his Broadway Mark Twain show. He told an evening's full of classic Mark Twain tales, gossip and jokes as only the finest Mark Twain  impressioner could. Not only was it a treat to see Hal Holbrook's impression of Mark Twain but, it was a honor to see America's timeless great storyteller come to life before us. Being on the Mississippi River Queen was icing on the cake.",1429056000,,769,4.485714285714286

7038326,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"First of all I have to admit that I love Hal Holbrook and find most of his work really compelling. I am also intrigued by the wit of Mark Twain. So a combination of Holbrook and Twain would be extremely appealing to me. The performance is wonderful! Holbrook's demeanor adds so much to the content. The wit and wisdom of Twain expressed by Holbrook almost made me believe I had been in the presence of the legendary man, had been engulfed by his cigar smoke, had heard his raspy twang from his own throat. I was mesmerized. It's a keeper.",1425513600,,538,4.39
7038327,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"When I first saw this on black and white TV back in 1966 or '67, I thought it was probably the best thing that had ever been on TV, and my feelings haven't changed.

7038331,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"Hal Holbrook is magnificent! I thought Mark Twain was in my livingroom. What a wonderful performance for Mr. Holbrook to be remembered by!
Tickets to see a performance are quite expensive and he has limited performances available since he is in his 80's.

7038356,4,B00UGPTP1Y,"Great DVD!  I saw this on TV when it was aired (and I was a young high school junior).  I loved it then, as I do now.  I then got the LP's (remember them?) of Mark Twain Tonight and More of Mark Twain tonight.  As well as I got the LP of this DVD.  When the DVD came out, I was happy that I could once again see the show and not just listen to the soundtrack.  There is only one flaw.  If you have the album of this DVD (I don't know if it's on CD), the LP has about a minute more material than the DVD.  I remember there was a commercial advertising it for TV and it showed a clip from the very beginning.  I believe that was cut from the master copy of the film and never put back in.  So, when they copied it to DVD, it was not there.  The dvd is supposed to start with him walking onto the stage (apparently being introduced) and saying, 'I hate to be introduced as one of the best authors. 'Cos they have such a bad habit og dyhing off.  Chaucer is dead, so is Milton and so is Shakespeare--and I'm not feeling too good myself lately.'  Those lines are only on the LP of this TV special.  It shows how we put sales ahead of everything else,( I guess. I just checked Amazon--it is still available on vinyl but not CD.).  All in all---well worth buying if you are a Twain fan!",1415232000,,1279,3.94140625

7038378,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"This DVD is of a performance Holbrook did on CBS.  I watched it when it was on originally and owned a video tape of it.
I liked it so much that I wanted a cleaner copy on DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD to all lovers of Twain and anyone
who is not familiar with his humorous work; the first stand up comic in America.",1395187200,,319,3.8923076923076922
7038379,5,B00UGPTP1Y,This is the original tv production.  Others available only contain selected parts.  This is the Mark Twain that you rememberer.,1395014400,,127,5.3
7038380,5,B00UGPTP1Y,Hal Holbrook brings MArk Twain alive again. I have seen Holbrook performing live as MArk Twain and he is amazing. This video captures that feeling. I now other actors including Val Kilmer have portrayed Twain but they pale in comparison.,1394668800,,237,4.95
7038381,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"If you like the work of Mark Twain and you want to be transported back to his time having an evening with him. This is a good as it gets. None of us were alive back in Mr Twain's day. If we had been, would like to think we would have found Mr Twain as Mr. Holbrook portrays Mr Twain, or rather Samuel L. Clemens, he being one if not the greatest writer/humorists of America.

Have seen Mr Holbrook on many TV shows and movies, I knew Mr Holbrook's work, but Mr Holbrook's true genius as an actor is wonderfully portrayed in his wonderful signature role as Mr Twain.  I actually saw him do this live many years ago in Phoenix. Sadly the audience didn't/wouldn't/couldn't tune in. He was masterful. Perhaps the venue was too large? Certainly wasn't a deficiency in Mr Holbrook's performance. Loved it then and now I can enjoy it for a long time to come.",1393027200,,851,4.345911949685535
7038382,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"If you're a fan of the angelically irreverent Mark Twain, there's a *very* high probability you will enjoy this. It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

7038403,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"Excellent VHS.  Makes you feel like you are actual listening to Mark Twain.  Hal Holbrook did an excellent in Mark Twain.
I like his smoking and going off.  He is better than the comedians on TV.  You need it in your collection.",1390608000,,228,4.357142857142857
7038404,5,B00UGPTP1Y,I remember watching this broadcast on television many years and laughing out loud. Mark Twain was probably this country's greatest humorist and Hal Holbrook portrays him extraordinarily convincingly. It almost as if we were allowed to go back in time and see the master at work. I was privileged to see Mr Holbrook perform live on a couple of occasions later in my life but none topped this performance.,1389830400,,403,4.855072463768116
7038405,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"Now I am a two-bit small time actor, and here is something I remembered from my youth.  Hal has here the perhaps greates one-man show ever put on film.  He changes fro an old man, to an older, to a youngster, all with a felicity and ease that is entrancing.

7038408,5,B00UGPTP1Y,I got to see Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain one night.  He was amazing.  My dad was a great Mark Twain fan and our family was introduced to him early on in our life.  So much that master said is still eerily true today.  This is timeless.,1384387200,,234,3.9148936170212765
7038409,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"I've been trying to find this program since the time I first saw it in the 60s. Holbrook does everything from a teenage boy to an old man, all presented through the character of Mark Twain.",1377475200,,189,4.277777777777778

7038414,3,B00UGPTP1Y,"Hal Holbrook is great in this.  He honors the irresistable Mark Twain with his portrayal,  Twain was extremely likeable and popular.  I also watched Ken Burns Mark Twain, which took you into Twain's life and home, and closer to Twain.",1371513600,,234,4.8

7038418,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"This program was videotaped in the late 1960s, right around the time that I actually saw Hal Holbrook as 'Mark Twain Tonight!' live at the University of New Mexico.  I thought at the time (as a fledgling theater student) that I had finally seen a first rate actor in his natural element.  The dvd is a video of the stage presentation, so it doesn't ""open up"" for scenic locales, etc., but Mr. Holbrook holds the viewers' attention with a riveting embodiment of arguably the greatest novelist, humorist, and raconteur America has ever produced.

In addition to being a famous author during his lifetime, Mark Twain was a noted humorous storyteller.  So when my group in American Association of University Women decided to present community-wide events this year, each tied to the theme of ""A Year of Lots of Laughter,"" we knew that Twain would have a central role to play.

7038458,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"I have been wanting a recording of this performance since I first saw it at age 12. It was a bravura performance by Hal Holbrook in his one man show. Excellent! I highly recommend this to any theater lover, and especially to Mark Twain fans. A wonderful performance.",1349654400,,266,4.5625
7038459,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"This performance should be required viewing for anyone wanting to become an actor. Even if you could set aside the wonderful storytelling of Twain, with its tales of morality, human dignity, anti-slavery, anti-evangelical, empowerment of women, internationalism, derision of politicians, self-deprecating humor and much more, Holbrook's performance would stand on its own as the quintessential achievement of an actor transforming live on stage into numerous historical and fictional characters.

You can see each moment of change as a subtle yet distinct metamorphosis. A white-haired man with a bushy mustache and cigar speaking directly to an audience first becomes an addlepated storyteller within the story, then an innocent young boy, a black slave, a white slave-hunter, a drunken racist father, a hawkish patriot, and even a ghost in the wind searching for her stolen golden arm.

Do not listen to those who say this 90-minute performance is boring.  It is one of the most engaging and gripping masterpieces ever captured on film, for anyone with an attention span at least as long as a paper clip.",1341619200,,1106,5.308571428571429

7038461,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"I have been teaching ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" in the classroom for thirty years.  If there is one person living or dead that I could meet, it would be Mark Twain. And this 90-minute DVD of a 1967 CBS television broadcast is as close to the real thing as you're ever going to get to experiencing Twain's lecture platform performance.

Hal Holbrook faithfully recreates Twain's look, his mannerisms, and his material. Drawing chiefly from Twain's published works, Holbrook tells of his boyhood, his experiences as a steamboat pilot, his world travels and excerpts from his greatest novel. Holbrook is an acknowledged Twain expert and Ken Burns featured him in his 2002 documentary ""Mark Twain.""

I have each of my students perform a dramatic reading from ""Huck Finn,"" and use the ""Huck & Jim"" chapter from this DVD to illustrate how it is possible to breathe life into these characters. [My only disappointment is that the ""Lynching"" chapter is not the Col. Sherburn lynching scene from ""Huck Finn."" I have a  two-cassette edition of Holbrook's performance, however, that does include this dramatic scene.]

The customers who have posted lackluster reviews need to realize that Twain was not a stand-up comedian. He was a humorist. A satirist. He chose his words carefully. (It took nearly seven years to complete ""Huck Finn,"" for crying out loud!) As Twain himself once said: ""I am not 'an' American. I am 'the' American."" This presentation gives you a glimpse of one of this country's greatest Americans.

Holbrook is 85 now and still touring, but even at the tender age of 40 he was Mark Twain incarnate. I get chills every time I watch this. It's simply amazing. There are many Twain impersonators--I even saw one this summer when I visited Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal. But no one touches Holbrook. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1329696000,2,1837,4.96742671009772

7038474,2,B00UGPTP1Y,"Disappointing. Mr. Holbrook is a great actor, but most of the disk almost put me to sleep. If Mr. Twain was as portray, I guess the folks were even more laid back than me. I am not a SNL fan or reality show fan, thus the presentations do not always have to be fast-paced or overly silly. I like good stand up and comedy in general.

Yes I realize that this was a portal/interpretation of Mr Twain Samuel Clemens], but the comedy was lacking. I have read his works [i.e. Mark Twain] and generally really enjoyed them.

Show it after you've read the chapter with ""All right, then--I'll go to hell.""  Lower-skilled students might be too put off by Holbrook's thick accent, so be aware of that, and they might not appreciate some of the routines, so you might want to pick and choose.  More intelligent students will appreciate just how wickedly funny he was, and how much he still has to say.  We ignore him at our peril.",1287014400,,562,4.752577319587629

I had just finished a book covering the last 3 years of Twain's life and was so impressed with the way Mr. Holbrook brought out the real Twain.

He didn't pull his punches, and Hal Holbrook was superb in his characterization.  Were he still alive today, Mark Twain would be more controversial than Michael Moore due to his delicate yet wicked touch and his intuitive understanding of politics and the nature of the human character.",1264809600,,440,5.0

7038482,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"Mark Twain travelled to Australia in 1895. A journalist reported ""He is in no sense a disappointment as a humorist. He starts his audience laughing in the very first sentence he utters, and for two hours keeps them in a continual roar"".

This video performance by Hal Holbrook captures what I imagine my fellow Sydney residents would have experienced 114 years ago. It is a delight to watch, not only for a glimpse into the past, but also to hear this timeless storyteller relate a philosophy completely relevant to our early 21st Century.",1232236800,,539,4.795698924731183

7038507,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"Long before Spalding Gray brought one-man performance monologues into the mainstream, 40-year-old actor Hal Holbrook perfected this wonderful stage persona as an homage to the elderly author of ""Huckleberry Finn"" and many other treasures of American literature. His resemblance to Twain is uncanny, his diction impeccable, and the commentary--all folksy wisdom and homespun anecdotes about politics and religion, women, aging, cannibals, and more --came from his long-running Broadway show. This program was a landmark in TV history, and minted Holbrook's reputation. Today it is as enlightening and entertaining as ever.",1182988800,2,621,5.911111111111111

7038509,4,B00UGPTP1Y,"Those of us old enough to have seen Holbrook do his one-man Twain show in the 1960's, and to have owned the original cast recordings ""Mark Twain Tonight"" and ""Encore: More Mark Twain Tonight"" know that this 1967 television version featured second-rate material. Yet second-rate Twain is still better than most comic/philosophical writing. (There was also an original cast recording of this show released.) Now there is a CD on Columbia Legacy called ""Mark Twain Tonight"" which combines some producer's idea of the best of each of the three older records. I would have picked some different bits if I had the task, but overall that is pretty good and well worth the money. Since this DVD is the only thing available showing Holbrook as Twain when Hal was still young, playing Mark at the age of 70, it will have to do. If you are a real Twain fan, or a real fan of one-person stage offerings, this should be in your collection...but get that CD also, before it goes out of print, for some even better material. In the TV show, the one mistake was spending too many of the 90 minutes on the more ""serious"" side of Twain---the anti-war social criticism aspect of his works. Don't sit down to watch this and expect it to be all laughs, all the time.",1158883200,15,1245,4.5625

Hal Halbrook has performed his ever changing Mark Twain stage act before he became a household name in the movies. It took a made for TV special about Mark Twain by Hal Holbrook to rekindle this nation's curiosity about him.

A lot of the things Mark Twain commented on then are just as true today. If it weren't for his having to do a stage routine to work off his owed debts, we would never have been introduced to his wit by other than the written word.",1154390400,3,620,4.336206896551724

7038524,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"In 1967 when Hal Holbrook portrayed Mark Twain in the CBS TV special, ""Mark Twain Tonight"" I thought Samuel Clemens' death had again been mistaken. Holbrook's impersonation of Twain was so real I couldn't help but think he was still amongst us. Naturally when I discovered the telecast was captured on DVD I knew I just had to see it again. And guess what? Mark Twain hasn't aged a day over 70. He still looks and sounds just as good as he did then.

Of course, if you want to play specific sections from the show, the DVD is indexed for your personal preference.

7038525,5,B00UGPTP1Y,"I was introduced to Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain Tonight in a high school English class in 1962 and have been fascinated with Holbrook and his Twain presentation ever since.  As the story goes, Holbrook took up cigar smoking to get the timber in his voice, spends three hours in make-up preparing, and has even listened to Edison recording tubes of Twain to get the voice and inflection just right.  Sit back and enjoy tales from a hundred years ago that are just as germaine today.  You'll soon be convinced that the man in front of you is actually Mark Twain!",1009843200,32,559,4.514851485148514

That Mr. Holbrook has performed Mark Twain every year since 1954, in over 2000 shows, is  nothing short of miraculous.

Hal Holbrook researched this role by looking up old newspaper accounts, letters and film  of Twain to get his characterization of Twain as accurate as possible.  The  illusion is complete. We don't credit Holbrook because he's not there- but  Mark Twain is and we are thankful.  Holbrook so masterfully weaves Twain's  tales together that we don't want him to stop and we want to return to his  parlor as often as possible.

It blew me away (though we didn't talk like that in 1967).  Ever since, I've had a blank videotape sitting atop my TV, waiting to  pirate a copy of the certain re-broadcast, whenever the industry moguls ran  out of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND reruns.  Of course, it never happened!  Instead, I  paid cash money for the 33-rpm record, and scratched my way to this or that  band for partly appreciative teen English students.  As always, the trick  to life is to keep living.  Today I blew the dust off my 30 year-old  videotape and set it aside.  My review is thirty years in the making.
