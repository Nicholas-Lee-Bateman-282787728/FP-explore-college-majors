8492874,1,B0064SVN8U,"One star for horrid picture quality, deceptive format. Blu-ray is meant for HD content. Madacy shamefully shovels SD video, poorly mastered at that, onto these discs. This is blatantly deceptive, but what would you expect from a hack company like Madacy, the last name in quality. Thanks for wasting my time and money with essentially false advertising.",1470441600,,353,5.2105263157894735

8492876,5,B0064SVN8U,I purchase this item and have been very happy with it.  I would purchase this again for myself or a family member.,1399507200,,114,4.181818181818182
8492877,5,B0064SVN8U,I have found this to be very informative. Due to its history format it is not a exciting film. The music is excellent.,1395619200,,118,4.173913043478261
8492878,1,B0064SVN8U,"If I'd realized that Madacy was behind this garbage, I'd have run the other way! As with most all of this label's releases, this is as about as interesting as listening to buns rise at the local bakery. Combine that with very poor mastering of the video content: no color correction when the alleged experts are interviewed, no sharpness correction to reflect the blu-ray format, etc. This will be donated to Goodwill, maybe a less experienced viewer will enjoy it. I certainly didn't. Madacy should be ashamed of themselves for selling this!",1362960000,8,542,4.9021739130434785
8492879,5,B0064SVN8U,"Being an Aussie with a Civil War interest this series was very informative with lot's more detail on subjects such as weapons , ammo etc than I have seen before. A worthy addition to anyones collection.",1354492800,,202,4.638888888888889
