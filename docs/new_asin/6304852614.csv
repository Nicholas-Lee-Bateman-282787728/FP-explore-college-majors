HK gangster movies prior to 97 are the real deal (many were made by the triads just to launder some cash) with criminals you can root for, and cops who just get in the way of their glory.

ALL of the Y+D movies are good, but this is the best. Scenes cut to a comic book of the movie which flips a few pages to get to the next scene. Anthony wong is at his peak with Ekin and crew seething with dangerous energy. A real HK classic!",1384905600,,580,3.9572649572649574
7878289,5,6304852614,"part 2 of the y&d series is a great wun to watch...CHICKEN played by jordan chan gives a 5 star performance!!! You have to watch part 1 in order to get the flash back in the beggining when ho nam and chicken were reminising and chicken had to flee to taiwan and brother yee tosses him ho nams rolex. The jap/taiwan girl in the movies is hot and so is SMARTY, ho nam's girl played by gigi lai. Brother FEI is cocky and hillarious,is it me or do i always see him diggin his nose in every scene??  well, smarty goes into a coma, ho nam and chicken are frame for the murder of the boss of the taiwan san luen gang. and the last scene where chicken  kills the girl responsible for all this mess( that jap/taiwan girl)..a tear falls down his cheeks, ho nam puts a ciggarets in chickens mouth, and chicken puts his sun glasses on..while everything is speechless and still. that was a scene to remember. that was GANGSTA!! mann....what the hell u waiting for???..go watch the ... movie already!!!",1050019200,,988,4.364130434782608

It has the same feel as Beast Cops, only there are no real good  guys.  A great action film.  I would definitely recommend it!",965433600,2,289,4.1454545454545455
