5567016,1,B00BAXTY8U,"Not buying it! This is not a review of the episode, it's a warning to not waste your money.  Wait! Wait until the entire series has been completed in the Blu-ray restoration. Then buy it.  Why spend twice for the same thing.

And by the way, I hope Paramount is working the on Blu-ray for DS9.  DS9 is the riches in story, characters and action of the Trek series and would look fantastic with the upgrade!",1362182400,9,406,4.302631578947368
5567017,1,B00BAXTY8U,"First of all this is not a review of the show or the series.  Both are great.  What this is about is the double dipping that we are being asked to put up with as Paramount releases this two episode arc with special features that will not be included in the Season 3 or 4 Blu-ray sets.  Read the write-ups on tvshowsondvd.com.  Most of us true fans have already purchased this series one or two times before (VHS and DVD) and now we are looking forward to the Blu-ray's (and don't get me wrong the video upgrade is worth it).  I however am extremly upset that now Paramount want's us to buy this two episode Blu-ray on top of the season 3 and 4 sets so we can see the new extras they have created.  You will not get me on this one.

Haven't we given enough money.  Please add the extras on the Season 3 or 4 set and don't make us buy both.",1361750400,11,838,4.036363636363636
5567018,5,B00BAXTY8U,Cannot wait to get my hands on it. Already pre-ordered the blu-ray and season three. Also looking forward to seeing Yesterday's Enterprise.,1361318400,3,139,5.363636363636363
5567019,4,B00BAXTY8U,"This was one of the greatest episodes of The Next Generation, but the ending always spoiled it for me...
1st off, why would a ""sleep mode"" cause a feedback loop that would blow up the cube, that's quite insane and ...even if it did make sense, it was an unfulfilled ending (however spectacular), like having the villain commit suicide.
...The Borg destroyed a colony, and THIS cube slaughtered the fleet at WOLF 359...
...here they were, having deactivated the Borg ships weapons and shields, for now...
...they could not think to take the cube back for research, so it had to be destroyed
...up to this point in the series, WORF had been beaten up by everyone, frail women, children, a bush, I don't think he ever won a fight (that changed later in the series where he became a real kick-butt).
...the Enterprise had been overpowered, outsmarted and beaten by the Borg on both previous encounters.
...the kick-butt satisfying ending I wanted to see was:
away team returns,
we hear: ""Borg weapons and shields powering up, Captain...""
Picard looks at Riker with a concerned stern nod
Riker steps towards WORF ordering: ""WORF, fire at will"" and joins him at the weapons console ""Let's take care of this once and for all..."" as they proceed to carve up the cube with a variety of phasers, and vaporize it with torpedoes.
...Worf smiles during the destruction, finally getting his big victory
...with the cube in pieces, Riker steps away from the console, however Worf continues to fire weapons as if possessed
...we see the crew turn to watch Worf as we hear ""phaser banks overheating, Captain...(still alternating between space and bridge shots)
...Picard pauses, letting WORF get off a few more shots, as Worf finally realizes everyone is standing, staring at him.
...Worf straightens up, gets rid of the smile and delivers a dry punch line, like ""Borg cube disabled, Captain...""
...the Enterprise, it's crew and the Federation getting a little revenge for all the senseless death and destruction THAT cube caused.
...and an amazing light show of weapons fire that we never saw before on TNG (much more-so then Yesterday's Enterprise)
I figured that they couldn't afford an ending like that back then, that it was cheaper to just explode the cube, then to orchestrate a series of weapons fire and destruction.
HOWEVER, now as they remaster the series they COULD HAVE given us an alternate ending like this, since they had to redo the FX for HD anyway.
---
This should be included in both season 3 and season 4 boxed sets as a bonus disk so that you have both the episode, and the movie.
---
Never understood the logic when they were remastering the Classic series where they insisted on keeping the FX scenes the same (short) length as they were in the original?!?  What a selling point it would have been to not only see all the FX redone, but expanded upon so that a battle included long ship closeups and full battles.  And when cut for syndication, they could have cut out the extra FX along with the customary 7 minutes, so that they remained unique to the HD DVD releases.",1360886400,11,3077,4.7388059701492535
5567020,5,B00BAXTY8U,If there was ever a doubt that continuing the trek was misguided the strength of these two episodes firmly showed there was plenty of dilithium crystals left in the tank. For those of us that have already spent the hundreds of dollars on the DVDs ponying up for the blu rays may not be a slam dunk. Truth be told I can only think of a few episodes that I truly need on blu ray. These two are at the top of the list. Q Who is the other. So thank you thank you for putting these out as a set in blu ray. I can't wait to view what I deem to be the best of any of the Star Trek canon on blu ray! The pacing and strong story line along with an ensemble cast hitting their stride in each of their respective roles makes for an hour and half of adventure that few other science fiction epics can rival to this very day.

But whereas I LOVE this 2 parter seamlessly edited into one show.....the aspect of ending part 1 into 2 loses the excitement, with the build up music to Riker saying ""FIRE!""  To the crescendo of music leaving you wanting to know if Picard is killed?  The 2 parter merged into one shows loses the pacing, but after that moment, it is nice to see the entire episode in a block.

5567108,5,B00BAXTY8U,"I won't give a detailed review of the content, as many reviewers on Amazon.com and the internet have already done that. What I will say:

- Video was scanned from the original film and digitally cleaned up; this results in the cleanest, brightest and most visually stimulating version of the episodes yet. I own copies of these episodes on DVD; the difference in video quality is night and day.

One note: there are three seconds of lost film footage in 'part 1', but they have simply inserted upconverted standard definition content so that no part of the story would be lost. I did not notice when watching (on a 70 inch HDTV).

- The sound is simply amazing. 7.1 lossless DTS Master Audio, and a 2.0 Stereo soundtrack (with Dolby compression). Subtitles are available, but you will never use them unless you are hard of hearing, deaf, or need to watch at very low volumes.

Dialog is strong and clear, special effects punchy. Scenes with big explosions will ROCK your dwelling given a subwoofer.

- There is a new special feature, 29+ minutes in length that was not included with the ST:TNG Seasons 3 or 4 sets.

While some see this as double-dipping, I prefer to see this as the studio funding something new for the fans. I purchased this disc at $11.99 (amazon.ca), and could not be happier.

For those who don't know, the movie is presented with the original 4:3 aspect ratio - this means that there are black bars to the left and right of the video. I applaud this decision; this show was shot and produced at a time when widescreen TV content just wasn't done. The studio opted to focus on quality of the shots and special effects, and not on cropping video or re-framing just to full the screen.

I strongly recommend this product, even if you already own it in another format.

Get this NOW. You will not regret it.",1398211200,,1825,4.556574923547401
5567109,3,B00BAXTY8U,"The dvd is seamless, which certainly improves the viewing experience. What does not improve the viewing is the 1.33 full screen format. In this day of ""widescreen everything"", it is inexcusable to use a pan & scan format. What is really annoying is the vertical bar on each side of the frame. If your tv allows screen size adjustment, they can be removed; if not......?

5567110,5,B00BAXTY8U,"Everything about this blu ray disc episode is wonderful.  I don't have anything bad to say about it.

There's one caveat.  I did not like the ""seamless"" transition from part one to part two.  I think there's something lost with the dramatism that comes from the part one ending where Riker gives the order to fire.

There is only one minor editing issue I sort of have, and it's where they splice the episodes together (end of Part I/start of Part II).

All that drama has diminished after repeated viewings of that episode, but how I felt is still tangible.  This Blue-Ray has taken that sense of wonder away.

5567166,5,B00BAXTY8U,"Star Trek: The Next Generation The Best of Both Worlds Blu-Ray is part of the 25th anniversary celebration of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This special edition of the classic 2 part cliffhanger episode of Season 3 & the start of Season 4 is absolutely one of TNG's finest episodes. This Blu-Ray edition has incredible audio depth & breathtaking visual fidelity. The production team restored & enhanced the episode from the original negative the episodes was shot on. All new special effects were digitally composited & redone to hold up in full 1080p HD. The content is filmed in the 4:3 aspect ratio due to the limitations of U.S. television in the late 1980's.

I was fortunate enough to see this feature film at my local movie theater. I viewed all of the special features including the making featurette called ""Regeneration: Engaging the Borg"". It has much of the cast including Elizabeth Dennehy, Patrick Stewart, Rick Sternbach, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton, Ira Steven Behr, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, & many more. There's a hilarious gag reel that will absolutely have you cracking up as the actors flub their lines. There's even an audio commentary track with Director Cliff Bole, ""Lt Commander Shelby"" actress Elizabeth Dennehy and Mike & Denise Okuda. Last but certainly not least, there's the actual presentation. All of the content pretty much sold the Blu-Ray release.

The feature film which is a re-editing of the two episodes recut to be a continuous feature film is absolutely exquisite. The colors have much more depth. The backgrounds are very legible. You can see the lighting changes from the original episode vs the Blu-Ray release. Mistakes made in the original episodes were corrected. All of the visual & special effects have been completely redone by Mike & Denise Okuda. The painstaking work that was done absolutely shows as everything pops out. The soundtrack as conducted by Ron Jones absolutely sets the pacing & the tension for this dramatic episode.

If you are a Star Trek: The Next Generation fan? This is an absolute no brainer. If you are new to Star Trek, this is absolutely one of the best episodes of The Next Generation. I would at least watch a few of the first, second, & third season episodes before coming to Best of Both Worlds. This film/episodes is a very pivotal turning point for the character of Jean-Luc Picard. The Best of Both World absolutely HAS to be in your Next Generation must see list. It has great acting, a solidly strong first part & a credible enough 2nd part. In 1990, the ending came off as a little weak. However, in 2013 where the anti-sec movement has become a legitimate threat in our time, the ending has a renewed, fresh, & relevant conclusion 25 years later.",1369958400,,2739,4.848290598290598

5567173,5,B00BAXTY8U,"These episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation are two of the best Star Trek episodes of all time, possibly two hours of the best television sci-fi ever. The acting is very good and the plot is extraordinary when compared both to other episodes of the show and to the general quality of other television drama and sci-fi programs at that time. For people who don't want to purchase entire seasons of the show, this is a good option as it provides a very popular story arch with some nice extra features all on one disc.

  Running approximately 85 minutes, this is a combination of the Season 3 Finale and the Season 4 Premiere. It dramatically heightens the sense of risk and danger in the show compared to many preceding story arcs. The plot pits the crew of the Enterprise against the Borg, the infamous cybernetic collective, who proceed to attempt the destruction of the Federation by assimilating Captain Picard and using his knowledge of Starfleet tactics and technology against them. The acting is generally better than usual for the show, as the cast seem to really bring to life an Enterprise brought to its knees. Especially impressive is the evolving relationship between First Officer Commander Riker and Borg specialist Lt. Commander Shelby. Not only does this near perfect moment in Star Trek history entertain in a big way, but it also sets up many (then) future ST storylines.

  The video on this disc is greatly improved compared to the original broadcast version. Of course, being an early 90s TV show, it is in 1:33:1 but the cleanup job for the Blu-Ray release has it looking exquisitely sharp. The sound is sharp too in its new re-mastered 7.1 stereo surround. The extras are also nice for being a budget release of a TV show. There are a few short features that give extra context to the show and provide interesting facts presented by the cast and production crew. For the low price, this is a great buy for anyone who loves these episodes and who doesn't want to buy two seasons of the show to own them. I give it five stars and would give more if I could.",1368576000,5,2084,4.634146341463414

5567187,4,B00BAXTY8U,"The theatrical cuts of TNG's two-parters have been floating around for awhile, sourced from a collection that was released in the UK but never in the United States.  I was very excited to hear that finally we were going to get at least one of them with a stand-alone BD release of The Best of Both Worlds.  Included on this disc are the two parts of the marquee storyline that featured Captain Picard being abducted by the Borg.  Both parts have been edited together into a single feature-length episode and watching the story in this manner is fantastic.  While some trivial bits of recap are lost, as we already have the episodes in their original format on home media (and can expect the original cut of Part II on the Season 4 BD) it doesn't feel like a double-dip.

I would have liked to see some more special features.  The commentary is nice but a more full-fledged ""movie"" treatment with deleted scenes, etc. would have been pretty cool.  The absence of Season 4, Episode 2: ""Family"" is also felt as it was very much a coda or conclusion to The Best of Both Worlds.  I'll have to remain content with my DVD copy of that episode until we get Season 4 of TNG on BD in a few months.

The restoration work that has been done on the TNG BDs has been outstanding and it is great to see that The Best of Both Worlds has been treated with the same quality that the full season releases are.  If you haven't seen TNG on BD yet, the visual clarity of this disc will blow you away.  Sometimes this is amazing, other times it lets you see all to easily the challenges of doing a complex science fiction show in the late 80s/early 90s.  Overall though, I'm glad to have this disc in my collection and I will probably turn to it over the season releases (which as a nuisance have the episodes on two different discs in two different boxes) when I feel like watching The Best of Both Worlds in the future.

Highly recommended for both casual collectors who enjoy the occasional episode and appreciate Best-of Collections and serious collectors who will enjoy seeing the theatrical cut of these two landmark episodes.",1368316800,,2109,4.4751958224543085
5567188,3,B00BAXTY8U,"I was really excited for this two episode set. I have already owned this episode in dozens of other ways(VHS,DVD,digital). The episode has been remastered in a way that makes watching this feel like I'm watching it again for the first time. The sound has never been better. The colors are vibrant and give the enterprise crew more life then ever seen in any transfer of this type. For a show well over 20 years old, the team behind this blu ray have done their best work when it comes to picture and audio.
Unfortunately that's about it. Other then a commentary track, a short blooper reel, and two original commercials (both can easily found on YouTube,these are just SD transfers) the disc lacks what could have been a good amount of extras. While there is a documentary which lasts about thirty mins it just doesn't cut it. The important things a fan is looking for like original TNG commentary, extensive interviews (they only have maybe 5-6 mins of actually TNG cast interviews) are left out. The absence of Wil Wheaton is extremely unfortunate as well.
Even with its faults on special features I still recommend this set for any fan however it's overpriced and I would definitely recommend waiting till its less then $10",1368316800,2,1226,4.706976744186046
5567189,4,B00BAXTY8U,"I purchased this and watched it last night.

PROS:

The Best of Both Worlds on blu-ray for the first time ever.
Restored and 1080p, looks better than original broadcast. The color, contrast, clarity, all looks amazing.
Great Dolby Digital sound.
Engaging the Borg special feature which includes interviews with all the major actors from the episode.
Gag Reel.

CONS:

They made an edit to the cliff hanger ending and spliced part 1 and 2 together. That was my favorite part of the episode and they should not have tampered with that iconic moment of television history. Ron Jones composed music named ""Captain Borg"" for the scene where Riker says, ""Mr. Worf, Fire!"" and it is cut short, reducing the impact and drama of the scene. It would have been much better if they let it fade to black, music finishes and then start the second half. They could have kept the ""To be continued"" or removed it, but let the music finish. In the special features, Seth MacFarlane said the reason he hired Ron Jones for Family Guy was because of his music in this episode. I would have preferred if they offered a ""seamless"" and ""original"" version on the disc, so at least we could choose what we want.

Overall, I'm happy to own this and don't regret buying it. For those of us that can't afford to spend $130 on each season to get both episodes, this is a great bargain at $16.",1368230400,,1362,4.542857142857143

I do miss the thrill of seeing ""To Be Continued"" after the above line is spoken but that is my only complaint with this version. The extra features are really a fan's dream come true. Most of the actors talk about the 2 episodes and it must of been filmed recently. The gag reel is hilarious.

5567196,4,B00BAXTY8U,"(note - my copy has not yet arrived; I saw a friend's blu-ray.)

We all know the story so I'll cut to the chase:

1.  The editing to combine both parts means a loss of ""to be continued"", a recap, and some music.  Much to my surprise, while the editing was very competently done, the big epic ""TO BE CONTINUED"" was missed...
2.  Film restoration quality is top-notch, as is the sound - the editing of both is virtually seamless, and the audio isn't overly loud or underly quiet either
3.  Three seconds of a minor reaction shot (in pt 2) had to be upsampled because the original film element was not found (3 seconds lost from this episode combined with 2 seconds from some season 1 story equates to 5 seconds of footage lost -- from an archive containing over 25000 reels of film is quite a ratio of lost:total)
4.  The original tv promos are included and are nice to see
5.  Loved the blooper real
6.  Liked the documentary with the cast.  Elizabeth Dennehy's input is great, surprising at times, and - as the 2-part story shows - did an amazing job as Lt Shelby

The blooper reel and special features make this an okay purchase.  I think it's been put out just for those of us who do not want to wait until late-July to see part 2 to get to see the whole kit'n'kaboodle now.  Which is nice, since:
(a) it's quicker to get this disc than to fetch disc 6 of season 3 followed by disc 1 of season 4
(b) casual fans who don't want to buy every season set can just get this story and watch it whole
(c) it's a very special episode (had to find another reason)

Fans who want every little extra will doubtlessly purchase.  More casual fans might want the whole series but not pay for these sorts of double-dips.  The extras are good, but they don't hold enough merit to be ""must have"".  Less casual viewers, though, that prefer special stories rather than buying entire seasons might find this set worth buying.  If they didn't care for season 3, which would be amazing since most of season 3 holds up amazingly well.

Definitely 4 stars, but not worth more than $14.99 for sure.",1367539200,3,2075,4.329015544041451
5567197,5,B00BAXTY8U,"After reading some of the other reviews and comments I too am tired of the ignorant ""complaints"" about the TNG BRD releases being somehow ""inferior"" or inherently ""bad"" because they are in 4:3 aspect ratio with the ""pillar bars"" present on 16:9 TV/Monitors. Although I appreciate that the vast public has largely been educated as to the crime that was ""Pan and Scan"" which was applied to theatrical movies which were shot in wide formats to make them fill 4:3 TVs for home video in the past, as the title states if you think this is a problem with ST:TNG (or ST:TOS for that matter) you don't know what you're talking about. If you have the Season 1 BRD set there is a short but very concise featurette that explains all the reasons why the show cannot be presented in 16:9 format. I highly recommend that you watch this featurette, it's freely available on youtube here: [...] (if the link is broken or isn't displayed just search ""Why TNG BluRay is 4:3"" on YouTube and you'll find it).

In any case:
1) In 1987 nobody knew that 16:9 would become the preferred format for high-definition television broadcasts in less than 15 years; nor that 16:9 would become the dominant format for home televisions. TVs in 1987 were all 4:3 aspect and had a lower effective resolution than your smartphone today probably does.

2) Although the show is shot on 16:9 film all the shots were composed for a 4:3 matte, at the time the producers had no reasonable requirement or expectation that it should ever be composed for 16:9 (see point 1). Therefore crew and equipment is often visible in many shots outside the 4:3 matte. The film itself in these areas was not handled as carefully as the composed shot and often has excessive grain and scratches from handling because again, there was never the assumption that those parts of the film would ever be used in the final broadcast.

3) From point #2 the only other viable option would have been to ""push in"" or ""zoom into"" the clean 4:3 shots and loose visual information at the top and bottom of the shot; effectively re-imagining the visual composition of each episode. CBS refused to do this as it violated one of their prime directives that this was a restoration and not anything else. Also many Blu-Ray players and HDTV monitors have zoom functions that allow you to do this yourself. I know on my Oppo BDP-83 Blu-Ray player I can set it to ""full"" zoom operation where it will take a 4:3 image with pillars and push into it so that the pillars are eliminated and the upper and lower portions of the 4:3 image are cropped. Also some TVs allow you to stretch a 4:3 image out to 16:9 with a kind of ""fish bowl"" type of effect (which I personally find generally horrible). Thus, seeing as how I can ruin the shot myself there was no reason for CBS to force it onto us by doing it permanently. Again they chose to give us a restored version for which they should have all our gratitude for preserving this program as it was originally conceived (unlike other science fiction producers that may or may not make movies about wars in the stars and refuse to provide proper restorations of their original products).

4) Furthermore many of the composite shots which used models were cropped to a 4:3 composition. This is dramatically demonstrated in the aforementioned featurette where a CBS technician shows us footage for the season 1 episode ""10101001"" where the Enterprise D is shown docking at a federation Space Dock, the film elements for the Space Dock were reused from the Star Trek III motion picture. Although they had full 16:9 shots for those scenes since ST:III was shot for a wide aspect, the composites of the Enterprise D model were cropped to 4:3 (this is visually demonstrated by playing the 4:3 composite over the 16:9 background shot). Meaning that they would have either had to recreate the Big-D in full CGI and rebuild the scene or use the original model shot and leave it as a 4:3 scene (or push into the scene as described in point #3). The point is moot however when the rest of the episode could not have been ""made into"" 16:9 anyway because of 1, 2, & 3. This was apparently endemic to most if not all of the composite scenes.

Now having said all this, the fact that ALL of the TNG HD restorations will be carefully preserved in their original format, meaning among other things a 4:3 aspect ratio, should not dissuade you in the least from your purchase of the feature cut of Best of Both Worlds or any of the TNG BluRay products. In fact it should enhance your buying decision knowing you are getting the best possible version of the show in this generation of technology, at least where the film scan restoration is concerned.

Possibly the only reason not get this BoBW BRD is if you plan to get both the complete seasons 3 and 4 and cannot see ""double dipping"" to have it twice (effectively). However if you're not interested in buying the full seasons, but are a fan of this particular episode and really want to own it, then CBS has made it easy for you to save money and buy just this outside the season sets if that makes you all warm and fuzzy. Besides BoBW as a ""feature"" is arguably ""better than"" a couple of the TNG theatrical features...but that is a debate for another place and time.",1367539200,153,5263,4.546413502109704

5567199,5,B00BAXTY8U,"This Blu-ray is phenomenal, but it could be just a bit better.  CBS opted for forego the original lossless stereo mix with this release (just as they have done with the Season releases).  It's forgivable, but only because the 7.1 mix isn't terrible and the DD stereo mix is still better than the original broadcast.  The picture quality is very good - obviously the best it's ever looked - but CBS could have used a larger disc to allow for a higher bit rate.  If you are going to buy Seasons 3 and 4 anyway, then I can't recommend this unless the bonus content and special case cover are a must-have.

5567203,5,B00BAXTY8U,"I have noticed a number of individuals have criticized that this appears in 4:3 aspect ratio, but the reality is that back in 1990 the original masters were shot way like virtually every other TV show of the time.  The ATSC standard that prescribed a 16:9 ratio for TV broadcast was still a good 5 years away so there wasn't much rationale at the time for shooting the masters that way either.  One can obviously force the original image into a 16:9 aspect ratio if the black bars bother one, but it wouldn't add anything to the image.  I don't see that the critical reviews about the aspect ratio seem appropriate criticism.

A few observations that I made over 20 years after originally watching the show on broadcast TV.  Compared to watching this episode on Netflix or the original broadcasts the visual quality is noticeably better as is true with all of the Bluray episodes of TNG.  It is easy to forgot how grainy the originals broadcasts are by comparison.  The graveyard scene at Wolf 359 looks somewhat unimpressive compared to watching the battle in DS9's pilot where we see the actual battle occurring.  The sound track for this episode is one of the most dramatic for any of the TNG episodes and certainly adds tension to the episode.  While I obviously know how it ends the tension of the music still makes it a nail biting episode and has still aged surprisingly well.  Unlike some of the original series episodes where one needs to look at them through a lens of the time, most TNG episodes feel surprisingly modern effects wise considering the age and that this was network TV.  There is supposedly 3 seconds of footage that were upconverted from the SD content, but I didn't actually notice it.  I might notice it on a rewatching of the episode at a later date.

  There are a few things that looking back seem a bit odd like Geordi rolling under the isolation door that is so high that it was no where close to the floor yet, but most of the acting is pretty solid for the show.  Commander Shelby provides a good foil for Riker.  The destruction of the Borg Cube at the end has been remastered with better visual effects although the story line of the episode is obviously the strong point of the show.  Since both episodes are brought together to don't get the dreaded ""to be continued"" at the end of part I.  Some people thing that this scene adds drama, but I don't find it that bothersome insofar as that it slows down the action to have the preview of what happened last season.

The making of the episode feature is about half an hour with appearances by Seth MacFarlane, Patrick Stewart, Elizabeth Dennehey, and the production staff.  I think it adds a bit to the episode that I wasn't familiar with so there is quite a bit here beyond simply the episode itself.

I have yet to watch the episode with the audio commentary so I can't comment on the value of the audio commentary by Elizabeth Dennehey, Cliff Bole, & Mike/Denise Okuda.

Obviously pricing on this will vary over time, but a season of ~26 episodes nearly 13 times as many episodes has a list price only 4 times more than the list price for this special box set so it is a bit expensive per episode.  For perspective at the time of this review I could order Star Trek First Contact for less money.  The mini documentary of the making of Best of Both Worlds is about 30 minutes so between that and the two episodes together you are paying for ~2 hours of content.  If you find the commentary tracks and the the mini-documentary interesting it is a decent deal as BoBW is widely considered the Magnum Opus of the entire series and arguably the best 2 part episode from any of the Star Trek series.  With the exception of the First Contact film this is the TNG cast at its' best imho so while it isn't cheap relative to the season box sets I think it is still worth it.  If you were going to buy Season 3 and Season 4 anyway this might be questionable as you would get the HD remaster between the two season sets sans the special features specific to this box set, but Season 4 wouldn't be available on Bluray for several months after the release of this box set.

This isn't directly relevant to this disc set, but I preordered the disc ahead of time and Amazon shipped it on 4/28 and it arrived on 4/29 a day before the official release date.",1367280000,3,4329,4.444303797468354
5567214,5,B00BAXTY8U,"I don't remember a whole lot from 1990 -- I was five when these episodes debuted -- but upon watching the reruns, it still stands the test of time as the best that Star Trek has to offer. The first time that any of the five series ended a season with a cliffhanger, the wonder and excitement have wanting to know how the second part -- and fourth season premiere episode -- would end as we counted the days down during the summer of '90. It's still hard to believe how the cast has aged and how different production values were for TV back then. Yet, you don't think about that as a viewer, you just watch and enjoy the story and the emotion that goes along with it.

The best part about this release, now that's turned into a movie, is that when you finish watching, you can switch to the Star Trek: First Contact Blu-ray disc and watch it as 'The Best of Both Worlds, Part 3', since that film plays as the conclusion to this classic two-parter. Definitely picking this up tomorrow and watching this again and again.",1367193600,4,1017,4.324607329842932
5567215,1,B00BAXTY8U,"Hey Trek Fans, Ask yourself this question. If part II of this great Next Generation story had already been remastered for Blu Ray why was it not included in the Season 3 Next Generation set?
Because they want you all to run out and spend extra money to get Part II when of course it will be included in a few months when the season four set is released on Blu Ray. Now I am sure there are some people who did not want to buy an entire season of Next Generation to get this story and for them buying this makes sense. But for the vast majority of Trek Fans upgrading to Blu Ray this is just another CBS/Paramount money grab. Not even any extra features that would make this worth buying.",1367193600,3,686,4.165413533834586
5567216,5,B00BAXTY8U,I was one of the ones at the cinema who saw this on April 25th. It was nice to see the work they had done to clean up the picture...but they did not change the aspect ratio. It was in the original 4X3 aspect ratio you would have seen it in in 1990 on the air. That being said...when you look at the gag reel after seeing the digital magic they did to this feature...you will not believe your eyes. No more grainy scenes...the audio was mind-numbing and saw no tearing of the picture like I have seen on other TV shows and movies converted to HD. The digital clean up of this is amazing. Another thing you will be amazed when you watch the bonus features on this is how long ago this was aired and how much older the surviving cast looks. At least with this HD version...we will always be able to see every one of these actors in their prime. Myself...it makes me feel that much older to know this was shot almost 25 years ago and I remember seeing this in first run in 1990.,1367107200,18,974,4.131578947368421

5567218,4,B00BAXTY8U,"BOBW was the best Borg episode, and one of the best STAR TREK of all time. Love the show, BUT why put these in a format with black bars on the side. I know widesceen movies and TV shows do it to preserve the theatrical look of the movie, and I know this was a TV show that was made for Square TVs. However, with modern ways of remastering and editing, I would have prefered the Full Screen, or letterbox. I got a 40"" TV, and would like to watch shows on the whole thing. I have the Next Phase Bluray, and it looks good, but I was dissapointed by the bars, but it looks great.
Great story, but why the black bars??",1365292800,,613,3.991869918699187
5567219,3,B00BAXTY8U,"Ok, this is the most spectacular Trek story ever written in my opinion and I was thrilled to see a blu ray release on the horizon.  I have given this release a 3 star rating because of the edit into a feature length presentation by Paramount.  Even though we all know the outcome of the story,  the cliffhanger ending to part one is one of the greatest cliffhanger endings ever.  Why oh why would Paramount ruin that???  Bad idea guys!  I was all set to hit the ""buy"" button but because of the edit this blu ray will not be finding it's way into my dvd library.",1365206400,4,561,4.196261682242991
5567220,5,B00BAXTY8U,"As a rule, I hate studio double dipping, but I don't consider this an example. I loved STTNG, but I don't like every episode & don't really want all the seasons. If my favorite cliff-hangers (like 'Best of Both Worlds' and 'All Good Things...') are available, I'd rather buy them than the whole season.

If you want the entire season, don't buy this (it would be a waste of money for you). But if, like me, you have a few episodes you really love, get these ""movies"". I have all the movies, and this will go right next to them. It would be nice if they added one or two episodes leading up to the main feature, though.",1365033600,13,618,4.237288135593221

Well, I got THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS for the extras, and that and the low prices on these made me order all the rest a day later!
I love em. And I love the full movie-like experience. And the quality of sound and visual is rich and satisfying. But even more than that, I love the care, joy, and info with which the makers have infused the extras! The docs are great and in old all cast members, which is rare even in some huge movies, and the commentary tracks, which I rarely get excited enough to even try, are so enveloping and informative, they give a deeper level of enjoyment. I can't believe these were made and with such care--so luckily they did so just before the bottom dropped out of the physical media industry.
For the price they've fallen to now, it's really an easy decision to get em. I'm so glad I did!",1503187200,,1045,4.309644670050761
