8372879,2,B002LFPBOW,"Y'all are truly tripping to think this is a fitting tribute DVD to Officially stamp this a worthy documentary. The quality alone boggles my mind cuz with all the doe and connections and tech today, the video quality looks real low grade VHS when if you see how far they cover, HD 1080p was and is in true effect by this time. I got a Canon 1080p camcorder I could have shot way better for next to nothin'. It really takes away from the respect that should be given this brother even from an independantly produced forum. Some of the info and the clarity of it was crucial when showing his real parents together or his son Lil Dirty Bastard. This should have been a label driven DVD with MTV respect on it and it was a real disappointment for me as I believed the hype on the cover saying it was the Official doc on my man. Im waiting on the next mans vision then cuz this was garbage sunn... Even with The RZA, Mef, Rae, Ghost and The GZA on it, I give this a 1 1/2 out of 10... Because they should have formed together and put they loot up and produced this proper..",1409961600,,1067,4.159420289855072
8372880,5,B002LFPBOW,"This was a pretty good documentary of ODB, it was real sad the way he had gone out even before he had gone out. The prison system messed him up bad. A tragic loss to an icon. But I am glad to have this documentary in my possession.",1375056000,4,231,3.8333333333333335

8372882,5,B002LFPBOW,"This was worth every dollar.  If you are a die hard Wu Fan you must purchase this DVD.  This shows you a side of the god that the media did not want you to see.  I really beleive ODB's every word about the corrupt government.(Not going to get into all that...)  But anyway, very well put together and very detailed.  SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!! Wu 4-Life!!  ODB RIP!!!",1270684800,6,369,4.6
