8347973,5,B001Y8DJXC,This movie chronicles the beginning of the Portland Trail Blazers to their first round draft pick in 2007.  I have seen this movie many times and I can tell you that it really moves me when I do.  What makes this movie really special is the way the director tells the story from the fans and players point of view.  It seems as though you are having a conversation with the people being interviewed. I highly recommend this movie if you have not already seen it.,1291593600,3,462,4.348837209302325
