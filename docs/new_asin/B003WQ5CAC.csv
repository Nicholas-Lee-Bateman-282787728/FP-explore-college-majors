8407469,4,B003WQ5CAC,"There are many memorable moments in wrestling, TNA does its best to try and cover these ground breaking, awe inspiring moments with this DVD and for the most part it gets the job done.

It opens with a brief history of TNA wrestling, showing some highlights from the early days up to the current day (at least up to the point of the DVD release). It is broken up into 6 long, long chapters, so skipping a chapter means you'll miss a lot of moments (which is the only bad part of this DVD in my opinion).

Chapter 1: The Hogan Era

-October '09: Hulk Hogan Joins TNA at Madison Square Garden: TNA president Dixie Carter talks about how big of a moment it was to sign Hulk Hogan, parts of the press conference are shown with Hogan in his usual cliched but inspiring form. Its a good segment.

-January '10: Hulk Hogan debuts in the Impact Zone: The crowd does go nuts for Hogan and he's again typical Hulk but it was a landmark moment for TNA. Nice promo by Hogan hyping TNA.

-February '10: Hogan Gives Abyss His Hall of Fame Ring: Abyss talks about how it was a very unforgetable moment in his career. Pretty goofy yet cool speech by Hogan to Abyss.

-March '10-Abyss & Hulk Hogan vs. AJ Styles & Ric Flair: The only full match shown on here, kinda makes sense as it was Hogan's only official TNA match (at least up to this point). Typical but fun pre-match promo by Hogan to start off. After a few minutes Sting appears and attacks Abyss and Hogan. The match happens again and its a basic tag match with Hogan and Flair battling for a few minutes, both Hogan and Flair bleed, Flair much worse though. This was more about re-establishing Abyss as he had been kinda misused for a few months, as Abyss hits the Black Hole Slam on Styles for the win. 7/10 for the match.

-Lockdown '10-Team Hogan vs. Team Flair: Highlights are shown from the Lethal Lockdown main event, not much of note.

Chapter 2: Champions Galore

-Kurt Angle Becomes The TNA Champion at Slammiversary '07: Kurt talks about how much of an honor it was to become the first TNA Heavyweight Champion. A few highlights are shown of the King of the Mountain Match where he won.

-Knockout Gauntlet at Bound for Glory '07: Angelina Love, Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne talk about how great the Knockouts Division is in TNA. The last minute of the Knockout Gauntlet is shown with Gail Kim becoming the first ever TNA Knockout's Champion.

-AJ Styles Becomes TNA's First Grand Slam Champion: Highlights are shown of AJ winning the then Legends (now TV) Title from Booker T.

-Sarita and Taylor Wilde Winning The First Ever Knockouts Tag Team Titles: Wilde and Sarita offer a few comments, then the finish is shown from the match at No Surrender.

-Team 3D's 23rd Tag Title Reign: Highlights from the Full Metal Mayhem match at BFG '09, which is worth watching in its entirety if you get the chance.

-Sting's Winning Streak at Bound For Glory: There's a short interview with Sting that was shown at Bound For Glory '09 hyping his match against AJ Styles.

-Madison Rayne Becoming Knockouts Champion at Lockdown '10: Madison talks about how it was great to prove her doubters wrong and make it to the top of womens wrestling. The last 2 minutes of the Knockouts tag match is shown, where Madison wins.

-Motorcity Machine Guns Winning Their First Tag Team Titles at Victory Road '10: Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin discuss how great it felt to win the tag titles after working so hard for so long. The last few minutes of the match are shown, which are really good. Makes me wish the whole match was on here.

Chapter 3: Big Matches and Moments Revisted

-Slammiversary '07: Road Warrior & Rick Steiner vs. Team 3D: Only a couple of minutes shown with Team 3D hitting the 3D on Rick Steiner to retain their tag titles.

-No Surrender '07: Jay Lethal vs. Kurt Angle: Both Angle and Lethal comment on how they both had good chemistry in the ring. The final few seconds are shown with Lethal reversing the ankle lock into a victory roll to win the X-Division title. This was called the biggest upset in TNA history and rightfully so.

-Monster's Ball, Bound For Glory '09: Beer Money vs. Team 3D vs. L.A.X. vs. Matt Morgan & Abyss: A couple of minutes are shown mainly with Team 3D double chokeslamming Abyss off the stage through a flaming table. Abyss is on fire and it takes the ringside crew a couple of attempts to put the fire out.

-Empty Arena Match, Impact: Sting vs. Kurt Angle: Just highlights of the match, and not too many at that. It was a good match though.

-King of the Mountain Match, Slammiversary '09: This is just the last minute or so where Samoa Joe turned heel helping Kurt Angle win the TNA title again.

-Triple Threat Match, Turning Point '09: Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles: These 3 had one of the greatest matches 4 years prior at TNA's Unbreakable '05 for the X-Division title. This time it was for the heavyweight title and only the last couple of minutes are shown, with AJ retaining his title. This was a fantastic match though.

Chapter 4: Memorable Debuts and Returns

-Booker T at Genesis '07: His entrance is shown, pretty good crowd reaction for Booker.

-TNA's Switch to High Definition TV: Dixie Carter and Jeff Jarrett talk about how rewarding it was to make the switch while in a new venue. The intro for the first HD Impact is shown.

-Tara, Impact, May of '09: Nice promo by Angelina Love firing Kip James, before Tara makes her debut. Much to the shock of the crowd and The Beautiful People, Tara then proceeds to beat up all three women.

-Taz, Impact, July of '09: Taz cuts a promo and hypes TNA, also talks about how Samoa Joe reminded him of himself.

-Ric Flair, Impact, January of '10: Just him pulling up in a limo, the crowd and people nearby were shocked.

-Mr. Anderson, Genesis '10: As you could tell from the crowd's reaction they loved him the moment his music hit. Classic Anderson here with his pre-match promo.

Chapter 5: Wild and Memorable Times At TNA High

-TNA Wrestlings U.K. Tour Attendance Record in '09: Dixie Carter and Jeff Jarrett talks about how rabid the fans are overseas especially in the U.K. Jeff talks about how the fans have been good to him.

-The Wild Backstage Riot, Impact August of '09: Douglas Williams, Brother Ray and Brutus Magnus comment on how chaotic it was. This involved World Elite, The Main Event Mafia and various TNA Talent. This was one moment I wish was shown in complete form as this was a fantastic and well done wild brawl.

-AJ Styles Beats Sting at Bound For Glory '09: The last moments are shown with AJ hitting a top rope splash and ending Sting's 3 year winning streak at TNA'a biggest PPV.

-Mike Tenay Interviews TNA President Dixie Carter, Impact December of '09: Dixie talks about not being a fan of herself being on camera but she felt it was the right thing to do at this time. Its an ok interview but to me Dixie just looks uncomfortable on camera.

-Rise of the Main Event Mafia: Nash, Angle talk about how they wanted to make a statement and establish themselves. A cheesy video package is shown talking about how the Main Event Mafia is the best collection of champions ever in wrestling.

-Ric Flair Aligns With AJ Styles in January of '10: Good classic Flair promo where he say AJ will become the next Nature Boy. Ric then tells a story about being in a hotel with Dixie Carter the night he signed with TNA. Good heel AJ here as he talks about how he's never felt like his ability is good enough for the company.

-""The Pope"" Becomes Number 1 Contender at Against All Odds '10: They show clips of all three matches Pope had to win to become the number 1 contender. Having seen all the matches I can say he earned it.

-Mick Foley Shaving Eric Bischoff's Hair on Impact in March of '10: Heel Bischoff is the best as he just runs down Foley and Jarrett. Nice segment where Foley uses Socko on Eric then shaves his head. The reactions of Bischoff are priceless.

-The Reuniting of ""The Band"" in March of '10: The Band is TNA's NWO faction, with Scott Hall and Syxx Pac. There are some clips shown of Nash & Eric Young vs. Hall & Pac at Destination X, where Nash turns heel on Young, thus joining The Band. Boy does Hall look out of shape.

-Jeff Jarrett Hitting Eric Bischoff with a Guitar on Impact in March of '10: Jarrett talks about how gratifying it was to do it and how fans said it made them feel good to see Bischoff get smashed with the guitar. It is a pretty hard shot and the crowd goes nuts.

-Mick Foley Gets Fired From TNA in March of '10: Clips are shown where Jarrett beats Foley with the stroke thus ending Foley's TNA career (for a few months that is).

-James Storm Spits Fire in Jeff Hardy's Face on Impact in April of '10: Storm talks about how he made his mark on Hardy when he blew a fireball in Jeff's face. Looked pretty brutal.

-Ric Flair Forms Fortune: Flair cuts a promo saying the Four Horseman are being reformed, calling them Fortune. We get a trip down memory lane as Ric compares each man to a member of the horsemen, I personally loved his comment to Desmond Wolfe comparing him to Lex Luger. Nothing against Wolfe, Flair was just right with what he said about Luger.

-TNA's Brooklyn House Show in '10: Jarrett talks about how a lot of people worked hard and the attendance and the fans made it all worth it. We are then treated to a commercial with footage from the house show.

-Ric Flair vs. Jay Lethal, Woooo Off on Impact in July of '10: Flair says Lethal is a good guy and a good talent. Lethal says he was way nervous trying to out do the man himself. Jay's impression of Flair is dead on to the point where if you close your eyes you would think it was Flair talking. This was easily one of the best TNA moments ever also one of the funniest.

-Dixie Carter Invities EV. 2.0 to the Impact Zone, Impact in July of '10: This was a good segment where it felt less planned and more of just let the wrestlers make the story happen. The crowd loved it all as it was just another wild brawl with ECW Originals and TNA Talent going at it.

Chapter 6: Top 10 TNA Greatest Moments As Voted By The Fans

#10-Desmond Wolfe vs. Kurt Angle at Turning Point '09: This was a great match, course only clips are shown.

#9-RVD's Debut on Impact in March of '10: They show how he beat Sting his first night in the company. Pretty good reaction by the crowd.

#6-Dixie Carter and Tommy Dreamer Announce the Harcore Justice PPV: Dixie says it was about giving the fans and the ECW Originals one last stand, a chance to say goodbye and go out the way they wanted to. Nice promo by Dreamer, seemed like he really cared when he said it to the crowd.

#4-Samoa Joe vs. Kurt Angle, Lockdown '08: Clips are shown of the match, it wasn't a bad match but it was more MMA based and that should only be in MMA, not pro wrestling. Joe wins his first TNA Heavyweight title.

This is better put together than their previous Greatest Moments DVD, though I do wish it was 2 Discs so some complete matches could've been shown. Its worth picking up though.",1306972800,2,12350,4.393154892496709
8407470,3,B003WQ5CAC,"TNA Wrestling has been around for over 8 years now & within that period of a time, various moments have been created that stood out over the test of time for one reason or another.  Around late 2006, TNA recapped their top 50 moments up to that point but so many more have happened since then that TNA decided to put out another set highlighting some of their greatest moments from recent years.

The DVD is split into different categories with the moments being shown in various ways either as highlight packages, the final moments of a match, or the complete moment when it comes to such things as a promo.

Styles TNA Title victory at No Surrender '09.

While any ""greatest moments"" list will always be up for debate, the one moment TNA left out that I think should have definitely been mentioned was Kurt Angle's TNA debut as that happened after the cutoff from the last DVD. Past that, this was a nice presentation to showcase TNA wrestling & I thought was put together better than their previous ""Top 50 Moments"" as this didn't have repeat moments or as many ""fillers"" so it's something I would recommend for a viewing but if your looking for just matches instead of highlights then it's something I would pass on.",1296691200,,4701,4.721951219512195
8407471,3,B003WQ5CAC,"I bought this expecting to be let down...a lot.  However, to my surprise, I wasn't that disappointed.  By no means is this DvD a great one though.  It feels very slapped together, unlike the TNA 50 moments (which was great) or the best of 2007 and even 2009.

One gripe I have about this DvD is that the chapters are bunched up in fours...meaning once you skip one chapter, you'll be skipping several scenes.  For example there is a best title wins category.  If I wanted to skip the Knockouts title match to get to the Motor City Machine Guns' tag title win, I would end skipping the whole thing and move on to the best matches category...Very inconvenient.

Contents don't include much other than more Hulk Hogan moments from his debut, to the giving Abyss his ring, his match with Abyss agains Styles and Flair (full match, unfortunately), and then the lockdown match in 2010.

Then there are the best of the title wins
-Gail Kim becomes first knockouts champ
-Madison Rayne becomes knockouts champ
-Angle wins all the titles
-Aj becomes first triple crown champ
-Aj becomes TNA champ
-Angle becomes TNA champ
-Samoa Joe becomes TNA Champ
-MCG become tag champs for the first time
 (matches no in their entirety, if you have the best of 2007 or 2009 then you've seen these matches already)

Best matches (if you have the best of 2009 then you've seen them all)  These matches on this DvD are not in their entirety, which is a shame because I heard the MCG vs Beer Money match as Victory Road 2010 was awesome.  They only show the last five minutes of most of the matches in this dvd....(except Hogan's tag match on impact).
AJ vs Daniels vs Styles (not in entirety)
Angle vs Anderson-Lockdown (not in entirety)
+ other matches on the 2009 and 2007 dvd

Other moments-Fireball to Hardy's face
  -Foley shaves Bishoff
  -Jarrett hits Bishoff with his guitar
  -Sting turns heel

Best Debuts- Booker T
  Mick Foley
  Jeff Hardy
  RVD
  Ken Anderson
  Tara  (no particular order, just trying to recall from memory)

I bought this DvD because I don't cable and I've been a TNA fan since day one.  I like to keep a history of the TNA brand.  I don't recommend this DVD if you already have best of the 2007 and 2009 and if you don't care for the Hogan era.",1289865600,,2252,4.506203473945409
8407472,1,B003WQ5CAC,Id really like to get this dvd but since TNA doesnt see fit to release a content list other than a short list thats on the back of the box how do they expect anyone to spend money on it?I won't buy it until i know what is on it. Im still mad i bought the 50 greatest moments dvd only to find they're were no complete matches at all and very few complete segments. TNAs dvds have become as lame as they're weekly shows they make it sound great then when you watch you feel cheated and wonder why you just wasted the time and money to sit through it. And now here it is the day of the release and still no one has any idea whats on it and plus for me amazon is the only place i can get any other wrestling dvds other than wwes since in my area our best buy and walmart rarely if ever carry tna dvds(cant blame them with TNAs track record of lousy sales)but really TNA give the fans an idea of what they're buying because no one has any faith in you other than a few loyalists(o and i am in no way shape or form a WWE loyalist)im a disgruntled wrestling fan and im tired of these kinds of practices,1287446400,,1095,3.936936936936937
