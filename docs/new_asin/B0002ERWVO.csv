8027284,5,B0002ERWVO,"Yay! The Rugrats all grown up!

Unfortunately this show wasn't on as long as I'd hoped when i was a kid. I remember wishing i could get a glimpse of what they'd be like older when i was a child watching the original Rugrats.

Anyway, its a great (and cheap) buy for kids and adults alike!",1389139200,,288,4.125
8027285,4,B0002ERWVO,"I own a good number of the ""All Grown Up"" series, but I like this one probably the best, just because of the mix of episodes. There's the title episode, but the other three are what makes me like this series. ""Thief Encounter"" makes me laugh and laugh, especially because it keeps you guessing. Truth and Consequences and Tweenage Tycoons are good to. Yeah, this show can get a little lesson happy (""and what have we learned today?"") but still, there are worse... a lot worse... ways to spend 22 minutes than watching an episode of AGU.",1154304000,3,536,4.536082474226804
8027286,5,B0002ERWVO,"Finally, Angelica isn't so evil anymore. I couldn't stand her as a 3 year old. I'm felt just like Mo'Nique (From UPN's The Parkers) stated in her platinum comedy series dvd ""They need to stab her, she's evil"". It is great to see her matured after a decade of being an evil 3 year old.",1099440000,2,284,4.181818181818182
