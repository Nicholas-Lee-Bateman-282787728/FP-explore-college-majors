1057213,1,6305652139,"...is a pretty decent horror movie, sadly writer/director Lynn Drzick can't untangle the mess of plotlines to find it.
Someone (or thing????) is tearing people apart in the woods outside of a small town. A hard drinking firefighter, his marriage on the rocks, and a buddy go hunting in the woods, for what is not made clear, and discover a strange shrine and/or grave. Thinking that it might be the grave of one of the areas countless missing children the two dig it up. What they find are the skeletal remains of some strange beast.
A nasty sounding roar rips out of the woods and the two not so great white hunters wisely beat feet out of there.
The hard drinking firefighter's marriage goes down the tubes and something begins leaving body parts in his yard.
What became clear was that this movie was shot in segments (i.e. whenever money was scraped together) and the scenes were written between shoots. Nothing in the latter half of the movie fits together very well, if at all. The twists and turns of the needlessly ""complex"" store are more the result of sloppy writing than anything else. The answers to just what is going on isn't really worth sitting through and the monster dog suit is pretty wretched. This movie is for only the most die hard bad movie fans out there. You have been warned.",982886400,3,1302,4.592274678111588
1057214,1,6305652139,"I just rented this movie and watched it with some friends.  What it says  on the cover and the general idea make it sound like it just might be worth  watching once.  We laughed through this whole movie, which was supposed to  be scary.  Everything in it is just begging to be cracked on.  From the  VERY bad acting to the inappropriate scenes, to the really stupid looking  monsters.  The story has huge holes.  Scenes that just don't fit in with  the storyline at all.  The only way I can recommend this is if you want to  sit around with some friends and laugh at a REALLY BAD movie.  It is  entertaining in that respect but only that.  Cannibal gerbils and devil  dogs?  LOL!!

1057216,1,6305652139,"This is possibly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting,  and I use that term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this film was not  consigned to B movie hell for all eternity. What could have been a good  idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget, poor sound and effects and  actors who probably earned their wings in children's television, and poor  children's television at that. With one scene reminiscent of ""Pet  Sematary"" and two nicely designed monsters, this could have been a  winner. Unfortunately, cliches abound and hamfisted direction causes the  film to be overlong in places, e.g. the first thirty minutes do nothing to  advance the plot and could be a mockumentary about a small town fire  department. Much more could have been made of the monsters and their  background but it was all passed over in a ten second flashback which had  to be explained ten minutes later. If you want to see how to ruin a horror  film, study this one very closely. In fact, it is so bad that people should  buy it for that reason alone. Especially note how the final scene looks as  if it was knocked up in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this movie on  every levels. The overall impression is that someone was given a below  average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no  budget whatsoever. With a formula like that, it just had to be doomed.",966124800,,1462,4.622568093385214
1057217,1,6305652139,"...and not in a good way either. What starts out as a promising title and idea for a film - a couple of guys go ""in the woods"" on a hunting trip and discover a grave of a horned creature - progresses rather badly.  The acting is very subpar to begin with, and the production values are  worse that what it tries to imitate - the Blair Witch project. Now, when a  film tries to be cutting-edge with a documentary style approach like Blair  Witch attempted, it can meet with some success.  This film is a rather  cheesy attempt to feed off some of the success of the Blair Witch. It's not  scary, and not worthy of even a first viewing - I can't believe I've wasted  my time watching it in it's entirety, but I had to see if it could redeem  itself somehow. Alas, it could not. The characterizations, the creature  makeup, and the plot are all some of the worst I have seen - almost  laughable...but it tries to be a serious scary movie and fails badly.  Now  some ""scary"" movies are actually funny, and I like those, but  this was just horribly made on so many levels.  To give you an  example, the two guys come upon the creature grave, decide to dig it up,  then see the horned skull, get scared and begin to run away... but then  (this is sooooo bad), smoke starts to pour out from the skull - bright BLUE  smoke like some one had put a colored smoke bomb under it (hey, that's  probably how they did the effect). That's when I began to know how  ""horrible"" this flick would be.  I can only give one star  for the attempt to make a scary movie about what can happen ""in the  woods"" as it was all a dismal disappointment.  Heck, even I could have  made this a scarier movie, based upon my real camping experiences.  The  movie's motto ""Venegence is Eternal"" is true if only the director  is forced to watch this movie eternally.",964483200,6,1829,4.2507288629737605
7892673,1,6305652139,"This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The creature looks fake, the actors are not even a little convincing. It is awful. If I could give at a negative star rating I would. Do not buy this movie. It is garbage.",1494633600,,220,4.0227272727272725
7892674,1,6305652139,"The story centers around Alex (DJ Perry) who is a fireman in the troubled town of Portage. The town is bothered by a random killer. Alex adds to his personal troubles by opting to drink after work at the ""Double Vision"" bar, an apropos name that boasts cute twin bartenders (Carrie Ann and Lesley Nagy). His wife Helen, (Aimee Tenaglia) who manages a pet store, doesn't appreciate him drinking. Alex goes poaching with his fire chief Wayne (Jim Greulich) and they eventually dig up a cursed skull. The town is now besieged by its second rubber masked killer.

Filmed in the scenic surrounding area of Kalamazoo, Michigan. The credits were plain and simple. The soundtrack wasn't half bad. Now for the bad news. The masks used on the killer predator creatures were fake looking. The jaws never moved. The acting, script, and dialouge were bad. It got so hokey at times I thought I was watching a faith based film. And what was that whole thing with the cannibal hamsters?

7892675,1,6305652139,"In the Woods (Lynn Drzick, 1999)

I was going to start off this review talking about it being the rare film where one can truly judge its quality by the first scene. (And don't worry, I will still get to that hilarious first scene.) But then I thought about it, and I realized that we actually do this all the time. I don't know how many people watch the first scene of a movie and decide consciously whether they should go on with it or not; as someone who has only left nine films (out of about three thousand, to date) unfinished with no intention of ever watching the rest of them, perhaps I'm willing to sit through a great deal more abuse than most. Be that as it may, whether you do it on a regular basis (and consciously) or not, when you see the first scene of In the Woods, you will find yourself wondering whether you should continue watching this in the hope that it may, eventually, get better. Let me set your mind at rest: it doesn't.

As we open, a team of firefighters is trying to put out a house fire. A woman and her baby succumb to the flames. Alex Kerwood (ubiquitous low-budget horror actor DJ Perry, recently in The Stalker Within and Blood Ties), who it seems has never managed to not save anyone from a house fire before, loses it. This is obviously supposed to be an emotionally charged scene, but I defy you to not burst out laughing while watching this. The overacting is so bad that it's funnier than about ninety-nine percent of comedy celluloid released so far this century. It is almost singularly awful. It begs you to turn this movie off. But perhaps you are like me, and once you've sat yourself down, you're in for the duration. So you see Alex going out to a bar with the other firefighters, then going home and getting into a fight with his wife Helen (Asylum of Terror's Aimee Tenaglia, very very attractive in a non-Hollywood sort of way, but can't act herself out of a parking ticket), after which the fire chief, Wayne (Jim Greulich in his only feature appearance; he is probably best-known as a voice actor in the videogame Mech Commander), takes him out for a day's hunting and a good talking-to. (Wayne, of course, understands the stresses the job can put on martial life.) While they're out in the woods where no one goes, they stumble across a homemade, hastily-erected grave. Wayne immediately makes the connection to a local serial killer, and wants to dig it up to see if he can find any evidence. Alex isn't so sure, but he goes along. The two of them uncover a canvas sack containing a horned animal skull. After which something begins chasing them. And doesn't stop.

The best way I can illustrate the incompetence Drzick (who also wrote the script) brings to the table in her only feature is to focus on that serial killer subplot I mentioned briefly. First off, it would have made sense to add the introduction of the serial killer subplot after the creature shows up, if you wanted the audience to be red-herringed into thinking the creature is the killer, as a number of things in the script seemed to be pointing to. (One notes, in passing, that the ""ancient"" skull--which we later find out is at most a couple of hundred years old--is discovered in a grave that looks as if it were dug just before filming. Which I have little doubt it was.) I should also mention, also in passing, that the one glimmer of hope I had for this movie came in the news report, which the firefighters see while in the bar mentioned above. With the addition of a second vehicle and a newscaster, the shot's blocked exactly like the closing scene of Jon Jost's Last Chants for a Slow Dance, as in ""way too exact to be coincidence"", and I figured anyone influenced by Jost can't be all bad. How wrong I was. In any case, the serial killer subplot exists for the sole purpose of throwing a couple of red herrings into the works, as I alluded to above. But then, I think, Drzick realized she had a serial-killer subplot on her hands, and didn't know what to do with it. As if the film were not already ridiculous enough, featuring a monster that looks for all the world like a Yorkie wearing a Megalon mask (you know, <em>Godzilla vs. Megalon</em>? Oh, come on, you're not THAT young...). So we have to have a scene, entirely unrelated to anything else, where the serial killer is identified. It's almost as funny as the first scene. It was certainly not intended that way. And in case you actually watch this turkey, I'm not going to spoil the ""how we catch the serial killer"" surprise. I will tell you, however, the entire special effects budget for the scene was approximately $2.98, because I know how much that particular gag item cost in 1998. (""Gag item"" as in ""you could buy it from the Archie McPhee catalog."")

This is awful from front to back. The only reason I could possibly see anyone actually wanting to watch it is because it is almost guaranteed to induce heavy drinking. I'm amazed it's not in regular rotation on Syfy. (half)",1307664000,,4978,4.485115766262403

7892678,3,6305652139,"There definitely are some woods you should avoid to visit and this film is one of them. If you like unbelievable, incredible, absolutely irrational and absurd stories, you will like this one. If you feel somewhat squirmy about bodyparts being eaten by a three-horned hairy monster, you'd better go to a fastfood restaurant and have a cheese-vegetarian-burger. You will have good reasons to consider the FBI is not better than the local police nor the local fire department. And you will also be quite satisfied by the fact that all men only think of getting drunk on watery American beer - nothing to compare with Belgian or English real ale - and that all sensible women should stay away from them. Hamsters are even a good alternative, even if they turn cannibalistic. But if you feel afraid at any time, it wil be because you have ingurgitated too much of a consciousness-distorting fluid that your wife would like you to drop forever. How right she must be !
