6253088,1,B00I80NVTQ,"A number of really talented people make appearances in the wretchedly unfunny teen sex comedy Behaving Badly; so many that you wonder if a producer has incriminating photos stashed somewhere. Not that there are a lot of expectations for a film so obscure even Selena Gomez's fans don't know it exists, and likely won't have a kind word to say about it even if they do. It's the kind of film where one can sense writer/director Tim Garrick throwing in every half-assed idea he can think of in hopes something works, but when nothing does turning up the raunch is his only fall-back plan.

Nat Wolff, who was excellent as a blind cancer victim in The Fault in Our Stars, must've been blind to agree to this humorless farce that wants to be outrageous and risque but comes up limp. Wolff plays Rick, and in the opening moments we get close-up of his crotch followed by the admission he has somehow contracted crabs. Yep, that's the level of moronic humor that is quickly established and becomes the standard throughout a painful 96 minutes. So what's Rick's deal? He's supposedly a virgin but that's not really a big deal because every hot piece of tail is throwing it his way. That includes his best friend's frisky mom (Elisabeth Shue), a smokin' drug-addled lawyer (Heather Graham), and random prostitutes. His mother (Mary Louise Parker) is a raging drunk, but she also appears as some sort of dominatrix-clad guardian angel. What that's all about is unclear and pointless to the ""plot"" anyway.

But for all the sex Rick can get he really has eyes for one girl, the saintly Nina (Gomez) who he has had a thing for all his life. She's the model of goodie two-shoes perfection and wholesomeness, certainly too nice for an awkward sex fiend like Rick. Of course she takes a liking to him, anyway, even as he gets neck deep in trouble with the local Mafia. Why's the Mafia in this? You got me. But then again there's not much explanation for Jason Lee appearing as a priest of suspect morals, or Dylan McDermott as a sex-crazed strip club owner. Notice a theme here? Sexual perversion has never seemed so tame, and as Garrick piles on one ""outrageous"" situation after another it only gets more desperate.

Not helping matters is a completely uninspiring performance by Wolff, and it's hard to tell if he's just bored or terribly miscast. Ultimately it doesn't matter, does it? He actually makes things considerably worse and every scene he's at the center of more painful than the last. Gomez is kind of fun in a squeaky clean misplaced Disney starlet sort of way (kind of like Spring Breakers), but that seems to be the only role she's capable of playing. And I have to admit getting a chuckle from Shue's endless flaunting of her rack, reminding me of her unsung performance in the trashy crime flick, Palmetto. But those are hardly enough reason to suffer through a movie this lazy and lacking in any laughs.  Those who don't run away screaming from Behaving Badly after 10 minutes will spot a brief cameo by Justin Bieber. What drags him into a movie like this? It was shot more than two years ago back when he and Gomez were still a tabloid item. Can't imagine why this has been sitting on the shelf for so long...",1406851200,,3216,4.626970227670753

6253091,2,B00I80NVTQ,"The funniest part of this movie was seeing the Justin Bieber cameo of him being escorted in jail with his head down in shame.  I honestly only rented this movie to see what type of movies Selena Gomez is taking on these days.  Let's see, how does one politely describe just another bad teen movie?  Well, to sum them up in a nutshell, they're all the same - really bad.  I don't find humor in alcoholism in any way, shape or form.  Mary-Louise Parker is adorable, but she should have passed on the role of the main actor's alcoholic Mom.  Selena needs to take on more serious roles if she wants her fans to take her seriously.  The title of this movie is appropriate as everyone behaved badly, although there were some funny scenes. Lots of drugs, nudity, implied sex, inappropriate relations with the ones who are supposed to be the role models for the younger cast, adults behaving badly, etc, etc...  I would say if you must, just rent it, but the price is the same on Amazon Instant Video as a purchase - go figure.",1405555200,3,1019,4.411764705882353
6253092,4,B00I80NVTQ,"This is a slightly better than normal teen-age sex comedy due to the all-star cast, but it is still a teen sex comedy. The film centers around Rick Stevens (Nat Wolff) student of the William Henry Harrison High School. GO HAMSTERS! He is infatuated by pudgy Nina Pennington (Selena Gomez) and on a bet needs to bed her by Arbor Day. Nina is a religious girl who likes Satanic music and wants to be a priest.

Rick's mom (Mary-Louise Parker) goes to rehab drunk. His dad (Cary Elwes) stays away. His sister (Ashley Rickards) is a stripper who wants to go to Stanford. Through a number of circumstances both Rick and the movie go on a Bender (Elisabeth Shue) as the production takes advantage of the MILF craze.

The humor is over the top, crude, and at times funny too. In fact it tries too hard to be funny which is perhaps its downfall as it doesn't engage the audience into thinking. Good film for those who like sex romps.

6253128,3,B00I80NVTQ,"Behaving Badly is story about an 18 year old senior (give or take a year) whose mother is a drunk, his father is someone who comes and goes as he pleases (from their lives) his sister is a stripper working her way to get into college and his brother is a closet case. His best friend is a dweeb, but not as much of a sweeb as the mobsters son at school who places a bet with him that he cannot get the girl he likes within a few weeks.

Ok, so the plot sounds like you've seen it before... but then again why watch American Pie if it's something like Animal House and Porky's right? Each film has a simmilar premise but each of them are there own separate entity.  However what I see a lot of, especially on IMDB is slamming this movie just because Selena Gomez is in it. Those people have pre-judged a film before seeing it, or went in wanting to hate it anyway. So make your own desicion on if this movie sounds appealing or not, and not influenced by people who follow celebrity gossip B.S too much and need a green mushroom from Super Mario.

The comedic tone of the film is OK, it balances well between a small bit of shock comedy to darker comedy, but not the gross out kind of way. The main character whoever he is does his role fine. Even tho he's not a super hunk, he's basically the under dog, but it's not something the movie is aimed at telling the story of, as it's more like a guy who likes a girl, lies about things to get the girl, then those lies come back at him tenfold. His love interest is played by Gomez, who the only thing I found off putting by the whole thing is even tho Selena was 18 or 19 here, she looked like a 14 year old still. She plays a dorky-goodie-two-shoes role, which is apparently not what she played in other movies, so I've been reading a lot of people complain because... well, it seems they don't understand what acting does and must be die hard fans of Liam Neeson who seems to play the same character in every film they do. Makes me wonder how good Indiana Jones was if Harrison Ford had have played it as Han Solo?

Elizabeth Shue carries this movie, she plays a hot horny MILF who seduces the main character, and she also happens to be his best friends mother. She does play it exceptionally well tho, and is one of her best performances in years. Maybe not award winning, but certainly a well played character who delivers some great memorable lines in the film. Also Heather Graham comes into the mix later as a lawyer and that big guy who squints with a deep voice plays the school principal in a small comic relief role not needed for the film at all, but none the less not feeling completely out of place either. A few actors play multiple roles, and some of it gets a bit incestual, but thats all for comedic purposes for a laugh, and not meant to be anything else but for comedic value to make the audience react in laughter or being grossed out.... or both!

Overall, it's worthy of seeing once. It's not something I could watch again, but it wasn't boring from start to finish and Elizabeth Shue is worth the watch as she really does carry this film and is whom makes the best character and lines. Also just keep in mind what I said about Selena Gomez slammers.... I didn't even know who she was till my wife mentioned who she was, so I didn't go in with any pre-notion of her, so did not judge her for something she did outside of this film.",1430697600,4,3400,4.224615384615385

6253137,2,B00I80NVTQ,"Enthusiastic but not particularly funny sex comedy about an unlikable dweeb named Rick Stevens (Nat Wolff doing a very poor job of trying to channel Ferris Beuller era Matthew Broderick) who has the hots for goody two shoes classmate Nina Pennington (Selena Gomez) and makes an ill-advised thousand dollar bet with a classmate/mobster's son that he can get into her pants within two weeks.  Rick is a virgin with no game and Nina is an unapproachable no sex before marriage type so the bet literally makes no sense on any possible level.

Rick's mother (Mary Louise-Parker) is an alcoholic who is always passed out or slurring her words.  His best friend's randy mom (Elisabeth Shue) starts having sex with him (well at least the virgin part of Rick's problems is taken care of) which is a bad idea for an assortment of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that her husband owns a gun store and is the jealous type.  To pad out things there are an assortment of supporting characters--Rick's sister Kristen is a stripper who is trying to get into Stanford although at no point does the movie ever allow her to be smart; Rick does odd jobs for her sleazy boss, strip club owner Jimmy Leach (Dylan McDermott--not a natural comedy performer but he definitely makes the effort); there's also something strange about the priest (Jason Lee, underutilized) who hit his parked car at a funeral and doesn't want the police involved.  To add a bit more bad behavior to the mix Rick happens across his dad and his best friend's dad in a hotel room with an underage hooker and takes pictures for blackmail purposes and also finds photographs that indicate the principal is spying on underage high school girls in the locker room--plus there are some Lithuanian gangsters.

While everything is played very broadly with the tone of farce virtually nothing is funny and the various plot strands and outrageous characters never come together in a way that is clever or satisfying.  Mary-Louise Parker and Elisabeth Shue are both wildly over qualified for this material but they deserve credit for their willingness to sacrifice their dignity so completely in pursuit of elusive laughs.  Selena Gomez is adorable but not funny, although she does get to play pretty much the only character who gets out of this thing with her dignity completely intact.  Heather Graham turns up for a couple scenes as a lawyer and is actually amusing, which is pretty shocking under the circumstances.  The Gary Busey outtakes over the end credits are much funnier than anything in the movie.

Behaving Badly's soundtrack is filled with 1980's songs by groups like The Cure, New Order and INXS even though the movie doesn't take place in the 1980's--I'm not sure of the reason for that but at least the soundtrack doesn't suck.",1423008000,4,2799,4.822546972860125
