8325085,5,B000FJ59A2,"The definitive Hyde, Fredric March portrays the cruel character that no other actor has been able to capture. Buy it if you can handle intense horror of this R.L.Stevenson masterpiece.",1524614400,,184,5.166666666666667
8325086,4,B000FJ59A2,"Although I'm happy to now own this movie as a single disk and the film quality is clear, I'm hoping this gem will be lovingly restored and released on Blu-ray - please!  My prior copy is from the flipper disk:1932/1941 versions. Prompt delivery - thank you.",1523750400,,257,4.586956521739131
8325087,5,B000FJ59A2,"Thank you, Warner Archives, for finally giving this neglected film the attention it deserves!  Released during Universals glorious monster era, this classic version of Stevensons tale of dual personalities and unchecked impulses has all the typical Universal flare - the grand sets and costumes, the love story, the familiar studio backlot, and of course, a monster!  Though the movie was a raging success when it was released, it didn't reach the iconic status of its peers Frankenstein, Dracula, or the Mummy, but it should never have been forgotten by the rest of the studios stable of horrors.  This edition includes a clear, crisp picture to see those still-impressive transformation effects, solid audio, and even 17 minutes of restored footage originally censored back in 1932 for its sexual suggestiveness.  Dont miss the opportunity to add this Warner Archives edition to your collection of Universal Monsters!",1522972800,,919,5.361111111111111
8325088,5,B000FJ59A2,I seem to like this version more than most reviewers here. I saw the Ted Turner channel and the quality seemed fine to me. You need to allow that this was made in 1932 so you must allow that the special affects of today are not there.  Generally. I believe it was well done.,1521244800,,274,4.074074074074074
8325089,2,B000FJ59A2,"The low price and eye-catching cover art are, per usual, all this Alpha Video release has going for it. Picture quality is typically dismal; musical accompaniment, typically slapdash.

For a superior presentation of both of these titles, I recommend the somewhat more expensive but reasonably priced ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Collection,"" a three-disc set from Grapevine Video that also includes a decent transfer of the John Barrymore version plus a lot of other goodies from the 1910s-1950s.",1508976000,,492,5.3076923076923075

8325092,1,B000FJ59A2,"Talk about a worthless cheapie! The picture quality is a multi-generation copy that has all detail washed out. Faces are a white blob. I believe Blackhawk films had good-quality 8mm versions of these at one time. Too bad this cheapie video didn't even try to get a decent print. For a true horror film buff, it  might be worth enduring to add these to your list but if you're a cinema buff, there's not enough picture quality to appreciate the effort. Let's hope a firm like Criterion someday decides to bring these out in a worthwhile version. Avoid this one.",1339804800,6,560,4.6
8325093,3,B000FJ59A2,These are the only available prints of two rare and interesting movies: too bad they are in such a terrible condition! For specialists only.,1332028800,4,140,4.875
8325094,1,B000FJ59A2,"this dvd contains both the rare prints of the 1911 and 1920's version with sheldon lewis in both roles!! unfountunetly,alpha video used prints so blurry and soft.that they are impossible to watch!! i have a dvd-r copy,from a grey market dealer,that is a hundred times beter looking and sharper print of of the sheldon lewis version! it can be found on [...]!! as for the 1911 version,blackhawk films has a razor sharp print of it in their library!! they sold 8mm,super8 and 16mm prints for years thru the 1960's and into the early 80's!! any of their prints would look better than this trash!! pass it up and try to find both films somewhere else!!",1280793600,10,648,4.643478260869565
