2667941,4,B000JBXHZK,"The movie was pretty good considering that it's a documentary about a non-famous musician.

My favorite part is towards the end of the movie when Kiefer does the countdown to 2006 in a venue called ""White Trash Fast Food"" in Berlin. The fireworks are going off and Rocco is playing and Kiefer announced the New Year. How cool would it have been to ring in the new year with Kiefer Sutherland? I'd be excstatic! Just watching it on TV eleven months later makes me grin.

Of course, the famous tree climbing incident, which I've seen a gazillion times on youtube, is included in the movie.

They travelled on regular airplanes, stayed in cheapest hotels, travelled in taxis (vs limos). Kiefer seemed so down-to-Earth.

And he actually got a ""I Trust You to Kill Me"" tatoo in Icelandic ruins (sp?) on his arm. How cool is this guy?",1163203200,3,828,4.612244897959184
2667989,5,B000JBXHZK,"I really like this DVD. It can be a little disappointing seeing Kiefer Sutherland running amok and crazy but this film tells it like it is. It is about his foray into the music production business and focuses alot on one of his potential stars. I never realized that he partied so heavily. Heavy drinking and smoking and trying to act like a rock star. Still, if you are a Kiefer Sutherland fan like I am - it is worth having.",1320451200,,426,4.271604938271605
2667990,5,B000JBXHZK,I am not only a huge Kiefer Sutherland fan but also a Rocco DeLuca fan.  This is a great behind the scenes documentary.  I love that it shows the real Kiefer.  I will watch this over and over.,1243296000,,192,4.0
2667991,5,B000JBXHZK,"I actually picked this DVD up at the local video store.  I saw Keifer on the cover and being the 24 fan that I am I read the description on the back of the DVD and thought ""Why not"", so I rented it.  I was impressed by this documentary.  I thought it was cool seeing Keifer drunk; he's hilarious.  If there was one person in the world I would like to spend the day with, it would be him.  But, the main attraction in my oppinion is definitely Rocco Deluca & The Burden.  I love their southern fried sound!  I probably never would have heard of them if I hadn't taken a chance on this DVD.  I love Rocco's unique voice.  The band member's are great at what they do.  I eventually bought this DVD because I liked it so much.  I would love to see them live.  Overall I definitely believe this is worth 5 stars.",1205107200,,807,4.070063694267516
2667992,2,B000JBXHZK,"i don't think it was worth the $20 i paid for it. I was under the impression it was more about kiefer than the band he was promoting, so i was wrong there.",1202342400,,155,3.727272727272727
2667993,5,B000JBXHZK,the doc is excellent and the music is of course rocca de luca and the burden; even the music that is not performed live is their music. i'm predicting right now in 2007 that this band will be the next led zeppelin of this century.,1198972800,,230,4.133333333333334
2667994,5,B000JBXHZK,"Highly recommend this documentary to anyone who's a fan of the band or even just curious about their music.  Although I would've prefered seeing more of the band/less of Keifer (though he does provide many laughs), it's a great documentary of a band struggling to get their name out there.  And after seeing the band, live in concert, myself, I think this DVD should be in everyone's collection!  Go see Rocco Deluca and the Burden!",1189036800,,432,4.733333333333333
2667995,4,B000JBXHZK,"This movie was a fun and intimate look at Keifer Sutherland's music label's first band: Rocco DeLucca and the Burden as they toured Europe for the first time.  It was a lot of fun to watch, and the music was great.",1188345600,,214,4.219512195121951
2667996,5,B000JBXHZK,"This movie is great, you feel you are traveling with Kiefer Sutherland and the band all the way there and back.

Kiefer's ability to seem so reachable is awesome.
The band has such a tremendous talent,
it seems you are experiencing the beginning of an incredible future
for this guys. Rocco DeLuca and The Burden totally rock.

This movie is a most have. Not only because is such
an intimate time with Kiefer Sutherland, but it gives you an insight
in what is like to be a rock band, if only for a few minutes at a time...

Great movie/documentary/video...loved it!!",1183420800,4,566,4.584158415841584
2667997,5,B000JBXHZK,"This is a very nice documentary film. It shows work, dream, music, friendship and funny things happening as the days goes.

I like it very much!",1179273600,2,144,4.538461538461538
2667998,5,B000JBXHZK,"It's too bad more bands/managers don't take the time to make these music documentary films. There is definitely a market for them. This one was presented perfectly. I purchased it prior to the bands CD, so I hadn't heard the astounding range of Rocco Delucca's voice. What an amazing vocalist! This DVD is well worth it simply for that experience. Kiefer drinks and smokes much too much, but the DVD reveals a very personable side of him.",1178928000,2,438,4.701298701298701
2668046,5,B000JBXHZK,"This documentary gave me a view of life for a new band trying to make it. It is also a big name actor ""Kiefer Sutherland"" letting viewers in on his life in an amazingly personal way. I loved the band and their music. I thought the DVD was entertaining, funny and touching.",1176163200,,272,4.25
2668047,5,B000JBXHZK,"For me this is ultimately about Kiefer. A grown man who has tremendous success but at this point in his life seems very sad and lonely. Still looking for his father's love and approval. Still looking for something more meaningful. Having been a hugh fan of Kiefer's for years and having watched his career highs and lows over the last 20+ years, most of the intimate conversations with Kiefer in this documentary brought me to tears.
It is well worth seeing. The band is great and you can easily see how Kiefer became such a big fan. I can't help but feel he was trying to live out a boyhood fantasy (of being a rock star) that didn't turn out as he hoped it would.",1174435200,8,665,4.328
2668048,5,B000JBXHZK,"I absolutely loved this rock-u - it had me laughing for quite a while and made me a huge fan of Rocco Deluca & the Burden.  They're a legit band - I'm driving three and a half hours to see them open up for someone next month.  It takes you through the normal trials of an up-and-coming group (well, as normal as you can be with Kiefer Sutherland as your tour manager), the pub parties afterwards and then on to the hotel antics.  Plus, there's a random person in a pink rabbit costume - come on, what's not to love about that?

A bonus from this film was that, after a decade and a half of fearing Kiefer Sutherland for his role in The Lost Boys (my older brother forced me to watch it as a youngster and I was afraid of the dark for years to come), I can finally watch 24 without freaking out!  It's basically his antics and whole-hearted efforts to get the band out there that make this movie worthwhile, but that's no slight to the Rocco and the boys.  If you're a fan of theirs, you'll definitely enjoy all the live sets they show - they're phenomenal (no matter if people actually show up and dig the music or not).  I wish they would release a soundtrack to this movie using the live sets from the venues.

The only downside about it was the annoying filmmaker/directer, Manu Boyer (sp?).  Some of his questions were just...random and didn't make a whole lot of sense/put people on the spot.  I think that's reflected in some of the band members' and Kiefer Sutherland's responses because there are times when it's just so stilted it makes you cringe.  Other than that, it's top quality and was a worthwhile purchase, but I got it when it was first released (I caught it on VH1 and had to have it for myself), so it was a little more pricey.  The cost should've gone down by now, though, so I would highly recommend it.",1173312000,2,1825,4.304093567251462
2668049,5,B000JBXHZK,"this is a absolute ""must have dvd"". i love kiefer and i love rocco. buy it !!!!!",1171929600,,80,3.764705882352941
2668050,5,B000JBXHZK,"Listen closely to Mr. Kiefer Sutherland's words and to what he does not speak outright.  Watch his facial expressions.  He tries hard to hide pain bubbling within him.  With personal screen/TV success, Mr. K. Sutherland's inner turmoil has subsided, but will remain with him until he draws his last breath.  Yes, if you care to, you will see this in ""I trust You to Kill Me"".

Kiefer tries to stay in the background wherever he and 'the band' go. Excellent band musicians, but, Mr. K. Sutherland has endeared himself to fans worldwide, not just by his ability and developed skills,  but by who he is inside his heart and spirit.  The band leader/vocal seems to resent Kiefer's fan adulation.

When Kiefer accidentally hurts himself as a child, Kiefer's father laughs.  For a long time afterward, Kiefer deliberately hurts himself, hoping to entice 'accepting' laughter from his father.  Ending credits notes the band fired Kiefer Sutherland.  I have news for the band - and it isn't good.

Kiefer will shine on, well past his sunset and he'll carry his Icelandic tattoo, 'I trust you to kill me', to the end.",1171843200,,1108,4.804232804232805
2668051,4,B000JBXHZK,"A little more drugs or drinking or hot chicks in the cheap hotel rooms would have been nice, but it's interesting to see that a BIG Hollywood star can have a heart and try to help the little guys while helping himself. A worthwhile flick about helping a band tour overseas. Other, related flicks; DIG, 24 Hour Party People, Overnight, Some Kind of Monster.",1169251200,2,356,4.578125
2668052,5,B000JBXHZK,"My hubby and I saw this movie when it debuted in New York City. And then we actually drove 14 hours to see it a second time in Atlanta, Ga.  We were absolutely blown away by the band and the music.  I'm not a huge fan of rock music, perse, but I LOVE this group.  We saw them in concert in Atlanta and then again in Baltimore in November.  We had the honor of meeting Rocco and Kiefer and found they're every bit as ""down to earth"" as they portray on the film.

The film gives you a glimpse of the personal side of each of them.  You get the history of how the band got going...and then you see them in action.  It doesn't hide behind any glitz.  You see the triumphs and frustrations.  But that makes them tangible to all of us who wish we had the courage to follow our dreams like they did.  Yes, Kiefer isn't the perfect band manager, but he tries hard and so loves and believes in this band that you fall in love with them alongside of him.  His enthusiasm is contagious.

A funny and touching story, following the band -- and their self-admittedly underprepared manager -- across the ocean on their first journey.  VERY well done!!",1167782400,9,1136,4.227906976744186
2668053,5,B000JBXHZK,"I first saw this documentary at the beginning of 2006, on British TV.

Not being a particularly big Kiefer fan (beyond Lost Boys or Flat-liners) I was intrigued by the band ""Rocco DeLuca and the Burden"".

It persuaded me to buy the album, which I loved. I then had the great honor of watching them play in Oxford (UK) in Sept. And I have just seen Rocco play solo acoustic in London (17th Dec).

This documentary is a great introduction to a great band and a great artist, one who is likely to remain on the music scene for many, many years to come.

I would recommend it to any who love live music, love a great voice, and love a good film.",1166486400,3,641,4.186991869918699
2668054,5,B000JBXHZK,"I saw this documentary when it appeared on VH1, amazingly shown with *no* commercials.  I taped it and have watched it several times since.  I think it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen of an ""unknown"" band trying to make its mark on the music industry.

I disagree with the reviewer who intimated that it was mostly about Kiefer.  It was probably half about Kiefer and his enthusiasm for promoting this ""new"" band that he's crazy over, and half about the band itself.  We see fascinating glimpses of the band practicing at Ironworks, Kiefer's recording studio, and there are enough interviews, interspersed throughout the film, of Rocco (the lead singer/lead guitarist/head guru of the band) to get a feel for him as a person.  My take:  he is one very intense guy:  multi-layered, charismatic, and angst-ridden.

Kiefer is amusing throughout and it's touching to see his devotion to getting this band he believes in off the ground.  At one point in the documentary, in Dublin, Kiefer goes out on the street offering free tickets to strangers, just so that the band's gig that night will be filled.  Wotta guy!  Also, Kiefer is quite charming during the moments in the film when he reflects upon himself, and most self-disparigingly I might add.  You get a feel for this actor as a person, just as you get a feel for the band Rocco Deluca & The Burden -- just enough to fascinate you and leave you wanting to know more.

I also disagree with the reviewer who intimated that Kiefer was drunk throughout the documentary.  I saw only a few instances when Kiefer was drunk, and it was when the band and its entourage were ""partying"" after the gigs -- which to me seems an appropriate time to be drunk, if ever there was one.

I recently heard one of the band's songs played on our local modern rock station, and I was thrilled to see that they *are* starting to make some headway; maybe(?) as a result of this film being shown on VH1.  I'd certainly never heard of them before and I've since bought their CD and it's fantastic.  So, the film won one new fan for the band and I'm sure others besides; which I'm sure was the motivation behind Kiefer's involvement in the documentary -- *not* to promote himself.  He hardly needs it, with the great success of 24.

On a side note, the documentary is also an absolute feast for the eyes.  There are many shots of the landscape of Eastern Europe that the band travels through on this tour that are simply haunting.  Between the images and the subject, there's not a single dull moment in this documentary.  Highly recommended.
