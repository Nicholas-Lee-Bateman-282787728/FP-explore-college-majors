718770,5,6303853110,This work out program has been excellent for my weight loss needs. It has great moves and great music. The work out is always fun and modivating! I  do this work out video 5 times a week for the past 3 weeks and have lost 6  Ilbs!  I encourage anyone with 45 minutes of their time a day to try it  out! It really does work! It works if your work it!,966643200,27,349,3.8055555555555554
718771,5,6303853110,I have used this video consistently over 1 year and find that it continues to be a good fat-burning workout because she concentrates on the big muscles of the lower legs. Easy to learn the steps in just a few viewings.  I consider this a safe video--low chance for injury. Gets you going.,939772800,10,288,4.433962264150943

7853896,2,6303853110,"I am a 71-yr-old woman, wanting to find an exercise video to use regularly.  This video is a bit too intense for me.  Also,  she doesn't give instructions as well as I would like them.",1351728000,,184,4.2
7853897,1,6303853110,"I was really disappointed with this video. This is so fast I can't even keep up with it. Maybe they need to say that this is not a beginners workout, even though it is Low Impact. I will not be purchasing any other Weight Watchers Workout videos.",1308182400,,246,4.25531914893617
7853898,2,6303853110,"I bought this video to help me lower my high blood pressure... think it raised it! I found the video very hard to follow. In the middle of a routine, the instuctor shouts CHANGE for a 1 step variation that threw me totally off for a significant chunk of the routine. I ended up making up my own routine to go with the music. Think I'll stick with Margaret Richards & Jane Fonda.",1111881600,3,378,4.191780821917808
7853899,5,6303853110,I bought this video last year and been using it since. It's a good workout and you really sweat.,1090195200,,96,4.105263157894737
7853900,5,6303853110,"this is an excellent workout tape.  i came across this video because i have begun a workout regimen.  this was one of the 20 videos i checked out from the library that was so worthwhile that after several weeks of using it, i purchased it and still love it.  it has dance moves that are challenging and fun but not too hard.
it is not one of those too short 20 minute videos, but it isn't as long as 45 minutes either.  i'd say about 37 minutes total.  when using this, you can make the movements larger or smaller to adjust the intensity. i am seeing a difference in my body already (with some help from disciplined eating habits). i love it and am looking for more like it.  i'd say buy it.  i am so glad i did!",1044144000,19,713,4.086330935251799
7853901,4,6303853110,"This low impact aerobics VHS tape is a terrific workout for beginners. It has ""rating"" buttons periodically where you answer a question on a scale and find out how you are doing. I liked that feature, and I liked the pleasantness of the instructor. The only problem is that at first, when you are doing it for the first few times, it goes way too fast and she doesn't show the moves in slow motion, which would be really helpful. Still, this is why VHS  has a rewind button - so feel free to rewind until you are familiar with the steps, then enjoy a really good work out. You will work up a sweat but won't be in pain - a good starter tape.",1024444800,9,641,4.128
