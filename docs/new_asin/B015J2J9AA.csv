8733751,5,B015J2J9AA,"This was a very funny movie. I'm a big fan of Ritesh and he didn't disappoint. Pulkit, who plays his nemesis/best friend was really really enjoyable. He was really good. Going to have to look for other movies he's been in. What was really nice was learning that Jacqueline Fernandez was in the movie. I love her.

Story line - this is about the stupidity of religious violence so best viewed as a satire as the political and social and religious points made are quite sharp. I love that they included a non-religious person (Jacqueline). I laughed quite a lot at little jokes. At one point kids are bringing in religious dignitaries to a conference and the boy assigned to the Pope and a priest refuses to hold their hands, because - you know.

I like that this heady topic was treated as a comedy because I think sometimes that's the only way for people to get the message. When I was done, my immediate thought was - I need to get some of my secular friends who work with people around the world fighting religious terrorism to watch this movie.",1489363200,,1047,4.476439790575916
