8201975,5,B000NQPU60,"This is an excellent collection of rare and little-seen video clips by The Moody Blues in thier best, early years. I ordered one from a Marketplace Seller here expecting it to play in my USA dvd player. No dice. This is a PAL format region 0 dvd encoded for dvd players in Europe.
Fortunately, I just happen to own a region-free dvd player as well, so no worries. If I didn't, I'd be out of luck. I did some research on this elusive dvd title and found out that only Holland was able to release this collection of videos, some kind of ""rights"" issue. Holland DID NOT make any NTSC copies for export to the USA or any other non-PAL format countries. Period. Evidently the Moodies finally squashed this release, because it swiftly went out of print. Make no mistake - this is destined to become quite a collector's item in years to come since I'm sure not that many were made before it was deleted.
Just make sure you can play non-USA dvds on your dvd player or computer before you buy.",1242000000,6,984,4.382513661202186
