7029298,5,B00U6QUXK0,Can't wait for the next season.,1465257600,,31,4.333333333333333
7029299,5,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent series .. Looking forward to availability of another season,1458691200,,69,6.0
7029300,5,B00U6QUXK0,"This series was fantastic! From the story lines to the acting, set design and production, we binged watched this and thoroughly enjoyed. I was so taken taken in that I checked YouTube to find out more about the actors and their other work (all very talented). I understand there is a second series and I'm hoping upon hope that Amazon adds it to their instant video library.",1457568000,,374,4.597014925373134
7029301,4,B00U6QUXK0,Nice to be able to watch a Danish film with English subtitles. The story line is interesting and keeps the viewer tuned in to what will happen next!,1456617600,,148,4.321428571428571
7029302,4,B00U6QUXK0,"Great story well told
Lear to read fast!",1455580800,,40,4.125
7029303,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Phenominal series, one of the best ever made. Can't  wait till the newer series come.",1454198400,,85,4.666666666666667
7029304,5,B00U6QUXK0,"I read the reviews on this site and was intrigued. It does not disappoint. The characters are complex and flawed and one's view of them changes constantly as does the relationship between almost all of the pairs of the characters changes....... as a result of the original action taken by Veronika weaves its way into the fabric of this family, creating and unraveling (and churning up secrets and choices). The twists so far (I'm at the end of series one) do not feel contrived but they do feel plausible in a family where so much is below the surface. I enjoy the Danish cadences and the rhythms of the language as well. The opening credits are wonderful. The actor who plays Robert is devastatingly handsome. All the characters seem developed, complex, and human. I read somewhere that the series creator wanted to stop the series before it started to get stale. Great plan! But- that has not happened- please give us the next season!",1451260800,3,937,4.719512195121951
7029305,5,B00U6QUXK0,A Danish gem! I love Danish television!,1449187200,,39,4.714285714285714
7029306,5,B00U6QUXK0,We enjoyed the first season.  Other reviewers said that the next season is not as good.  Enjoy the first season.,1449100800,,112,4.55
7029307,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Watching Season 2 now-- this series is excellent. The acting is first rate-can't decide which I like better, The Legacy or Borgen (both Danish
series available through Amazon). Episode I watched last night had me on the edge of my seat. Thrilling! As a first generation American of
Danish descent I am finding my Danish language skills improving--the English subtitles are better than most (although the subtitles seem to
add the 'f' word more than it is spoken-so some translation could be improved)",1448150400,2,500,5.036144578313253
7029308,5,B00U6QUXK0,"I will try to make this short........I'm Danish, living in the US and have watched all the series to come out of Denmark......The Legacy is really my favourite. Amazing acting, very true to the Danish psyche, yet entirely translateable....fascinating plot, catchy embiance. A family drama we can on some level all relate to.... So entirely worth watching! Danish television at it's best! And that's saying a lot these days....",1446508800,5,426,5.188405797101449
7029309,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Apparenty the Danes know how to do good tv. The first Danish series I watched was Borgen (excellent! don't miss!), then the original Swedish/Danish version of The Bridge (another don't miss!) and now The Legacy. Can't wait for Season 2!",1446336000,,236,4.925
7029310,5,B00U6QUXK0,A five star dysfunctional family.,1446076800,,33,5.8
7029311,5,B00U6QUXK0,"This series had me breathless from the first episode and it didn't ever let up. The death, in the pilot episode, of a renowned artist launches the series, and brings her four children together. They struggle to deal with her legacy and estate, while centrifugal forces tear them apart. The sibling relationships are gritty, vivid and heart breaking.  I love the moody acting, production, and sets, but most of all I am thrilled with the scripts, which are fast paced, surprising, and always evolving as they drive the tale ever closer to the knife edge of tragedy. Each character seems to reveal a different aspect of the strange darkness in the northern European psyche.",1443744000,6,671,4.885964912280702
7029312,4,B00U6QUXK0,"Consistent with Danish dramas, this has all of the elements: fine acting and directing, excellent quality of production, sound and taut wring.
Jealousy and envy begin to destroy a family.",1443139200,,187,5.266666666666667
7029313,5,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent drama.,1441843200,,16,7.5
7029314,5,B00U6QUXK0,"I want season 2 of this, I loved this...wonderful acting",1441584000,,56,4.7
7029315,4,B00U6QUXK0,"Terrific show,  start is a bit slow but characters are fascinating and engaging.  Definitely worth a watch. Hope Season 2 is available to stream soon.",1441584000,,150,4.96
7029316,5,B00U6QUXK0,Another excellent program from Denmark...a must see!,1441584000,,52,6.571428571428571
7029317,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Great Danish drama...Watch the first two episodes before you decide. I was hooked.
Great writing, pretty great acting also...the twists and turns never end but do not get ridiculous.
The only CON....worst dressed bunch on tv..but the story and acting make up for it.",1441411200,,266,5.068181818181818
7029318,5,B00U6QUXK0,Intelligently written and acted.  Excellent drama.,1441152000,,50,7.333333333333333
7029319,4,B00U6QUXK0,Another good Danish TV drama series! Unusual story about an atypical family dealing with inheritance issues. At first I wondered how this plot could be extended to include multiple episodes but the numerous twists and turns in this series answered that question. A truly interesting TV series.,1441065600,3,293,5.25531914893617
7029320,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Getting into yet another northern european mood - Danish this time. Really enjoyed this, although have had to watch a few episodes more than once. Must really pay attention with subtitles.  Loved the shifting prospective on the legacy itself.",1440979200,,242,5.205128205128205
7029321,5,B00U6QUXK0,Can't wait for Season 2.,1440892800,,24,4.0

7029326,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Great start! Episode one reminds me of a soap opera with great acting, beautiful sceneries, and complicated characters just like you and me.",1439251200,,140,5.130434782608695
7029327,5,B00U6QUXK0,Gripping. Realistic. Unsentimental.,1439164800,,35,11.0
7029328,5,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent series.  Intriguing characters and story line.,1439078400,,56,7.0
7029329,2,B00U6QUXK0,Boring. Couldn't finish this movie.,1438992000,,35,6.2
7029330,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Great series--really enjoyed.  Characters are well developed.  You like them in spite of there wrong-headed ness, their obsessions--but maybe because of them.  When will series 2 come to Amazon?",1438473600,,194,5.620689655172414
7029331,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Loved it!  Being adopted myself, this story definitely captures the complexities of meeting your bio family for the first time.",1438300800,,127,5.35
7029332,4,B00U6QUXK0,"If I were able to do so, I'd increase my rating to 4.5.  Very good, though not quite a 5.",1438214400,,89,3.45
7029333,3,B00U6QUXK0,Another from the Borgen crew. The writing isn't up to Borgen standards.,1437782400,,71,5.0
7029334,5,B00U6QUXK0,"I saw the last episode of the first season on TV late one night .  That was all I needed to get hooked.
Great story, beautiful characters, setting, language, etc. A MUST watch!",1437523200,,176,4.333333333333333
7029335,5,B00U6QUXK0,I can't wait for the next season.,1437436800,,33,3.857142857142857
7029336,5,B00U6QUXK0,This is a great show! wonderful plot and acting. Can't wait for season 2 to be released.,1437177600,,88,4.235294117647059
7029337,5,B00U6QUXK0,This is good not great but well worth the money for us. It's hard to find one like the Bridge or The Killing but this one has kept us interested and waiting to see what happens next.,1436832000,,182,3.945945945945946
7029338,4,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent acting but the plot is naive in some places.,1436745600,,54,4.5
7029339,2,B00U6QUXK0,"Did not care for the main character.  She really didn't seem to have many redeeming qualities.  Anyway, we only watched one episode; that was enough.",1436400000,,149,4.92
7029340,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Exceptional writing and acting, and a fascinating insight into contemporary Danish society.  I just read that the Danes are rated ""the happiest people on earth"" but certainly not these characters who have, to put it mildly, ""issues"" -- some of their late mother's making and many of their own.",1436400000,,293,4.979591836734694
7029341,5,B00U6QUXK0,"I really enjoyed watching this series. The first episode was not as good as the subsequent ones, which makes sense since the mystery takes some time to fully develop and then for the viewer to solve. The dynamics between members of the immediate and extended families and others is really fascinating.",1435968000,,301,4.921568627450981
7029342,5,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent,1435968000,,9,9.0
7029343,5,B00U6QUXK0,I would like to see more similar shows on Amazon.,1435276800,,49,4.0
7029344,5,B00U6QUXK0,"If you liked Borgen and the original Danish versions of The Killing and The Bridge, you'll enjoy this.  However, filled as it is with subtle observations about class, this series doesn't have the binge-inducing lure of those others.  It's much less about what happens next than watching how the characters interact. Oddly, the creators say they were influenced by Downton Abbey, but The Legacy is contemporary and completely free of the cliches that drive that silly guilty-pleasure show.  Still, it is essentially a really, really good, really, really intelligent, and really, really nuanced soap-opera.  Sounds like an oxymoron, but true!  The acting is fantastic, and it is always gorgeous to look at; I hope further seasons follow.",1435276800,8,735,5.247863247863248
7029345,5,B00U6QUXK0,Very good,1434585600,,9,4.0
7029346,4,B00U6QUXK0,"At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this series but it grew on me after several episodes.  The complexities (or should I say complexes) of the characters and their motives became interesting and made me want to see the next episode.  I was intrigued by the contrasts between the cool, modern interiors of some living spaces and the chaos and dilapidated condition of others.  It was also interesting to see cool and reserved characters set out to get drunk in order to free their emotions and disinhibit their behavior.  I guess the famously broadminded Scandinavians have trouble acting on their impulses without a glass in hand.  I am glad there is a second series because the last episode left a lot of loose ends.  I will definitely buy Season 2.",1434585600,10,757,4.654135338345864
7029347,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Another,  really amazing film coming from Denmark !  I am just going to hope that there is another episode and that this was not ""The End"" .......!?  I suppose one can 'imagine' different scenarios - how this might have continued,  did Emil really NOT get out of jail in Thailand?  I  will hope that Amazon has the next
Episode = of The Legacy,  coming soon !
Am I the only one that feels that the acting is just - amazing ?  I forget that they ARE actors,  they....are all
just so incredibly good.",1434326400,2,498,4.268817204301075
8704525,5,B00U6QUXK0,I watched Season 1-3 and loved it!,1511654400,,34,4.0
8704526,5,B00U6QUXK0,I really enjoyed this. Lots of plot twists. Engaging characters. Great family drama. No action or police procedural if that is what you are looking for - just dysfunctional family drama. I don't know why I can't find Season 2 - it has been out for awhile.  Hopefully Amazon will stream it soon.,1503273600,,294,4.547169811320755
8704527,4,B00U6QUXK0,"Read a review of this show and purchased this on my Amazon Prime.  The reviewer enjoyed this show more than the Bridge so I was really expecting something exciting.  It was OK, but seemed more like the soap opera genre than thriller.  I did watch until the end of season 1 . I did not purchase season 2.",1497225600,,303,4.189655172413793
8704528,2,B00U6QUXK0,Found it boring.,1489708800,,16,4.666666666666667
8704529,5,B00U6QUXK0,"Superb! We enjoyed the Legacy from start to finish and cannot wait to watch season 2! Incredibly well acted and even in translation, the dialogues come through as being well written. Now where is the second season????",1487980800,,217,4.891891891891892
8704530,5,B00U6QUXK0,Excellent series. Where's season 2?!,1486166400,,36,6.4

8704532,5,B00U6QUXK0,Fabulous. When can I stream season 2- can't wait?,1470700800,,49,4.555555555555555
