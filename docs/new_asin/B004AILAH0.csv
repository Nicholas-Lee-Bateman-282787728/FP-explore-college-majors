8420361,5,B004AILAH0,"I saw this movie at its premiere a while back and though I am sure it changed a little bit it was hilarious. I laughed so much my stomach was sore (bonus ab work I guess). Mulroney is amazing as a washed up pop star running her own small business and being, at best, a mediocre mother or roommate to her daughter. Schraft is hilarious as her ex-husband and, well, you'll see. Full of cameos from all kinds of comedic greats, cult heroes and recognizable faces I couldn't recommend this more to anyone who likes a comedy that is, how do you put this...dark?",1299283200,,556,4.355769230769231
8420362,5,B004AILAH0,"An ace mockumentary, it's dark, colourful, twisted, touching, eccentric, outrageous and extremely funny. And the sountrack is absolutely brilliant - great tunes, wild lyrics. So buy the dvd and the cd. There's not much out there that can guarantee to add a little bit of light to life, but for all it's depravity, Sunny and Share Love You is one such thing....",1299024000,,360,4.82258064516129
8420363,5,B004AILAH0,"This film pushes the envelope, then tears it up into confetti and dances around on the scraps.  The two lead actors (Michele Mulroney and Micah Schraft) are sexy, smart, funny and crazy and they can really sing (apparently they wrote the script and the music as well).  It is full of songs that are lyrically dark and twisted, but musically catchy, melodic and fun.  The story takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns and features some brilliant, surprise appearances by recognizable actors like Chris Parnell (formerly of SNL), Matt Malloy (In The Company of Men, Six Feet Under), Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show, Napoleon Dynamite) and the always-amazing, Stephen Root (NewsRadio, Office Space, True Blood).  The fact that these, talented, established actors appear in such a small, low-budget film should give you an idea of the quality of the material and the magnetism of the two stars.  I highly recommend that you let Sunny and Share Love You...just try not to get any on you.",1298419200,,989,4.8982035928143715
8420364,5,B004AILAH0,"I first saw this film at a screening in Los Angeles and was blown away.
So often low-budget indies falter, either from a lack of story, bad
acting, or chaotic production.

Sunny & Share Love you is a rare exception. It is so clearly the bold
and un-censored vision of its co-creators, Michele Mulroney & Micah
Schraft (who are also the film's stars and the writers of the dozen or
so songs that make up the hysterical, hummable, and sad soundtrack. It
sort of redefines emo in a sick AND inventive way. Who knew this was
possible?)

Now to the nitty gritty. The writing is wild, inventive, dark, gross,
funny, sad, demented, surprising, and seems to actually have something
to say about love, friendship, family, and art. A tall order for a
mocumentary. But it scores. Big time.

By the DVD.  And BUY the soundtrack:  Sex Lies & Preschool.  Pop it onto your iTunes and you'll find yourself infectiously singing outrageous lyrics to catchy tunes like Pumpkin Man.  A song about a man who attracts kiddies at Halloween by wearing a pumpkin costume...

""It's just your luck.  It's just your luck.  He comes over to ask you, if you needed a blowpop to suck.  Why does he wear that orange mask?  Satisfy that sweet tooth, with a bite-size Baby Ruth.  You can have a gummy bear.  If you flash your underwear...""

I'm singing it right now!",1292025600,,1332,4.584745762711864
