Still have yet to watch the other 2. This movie pack is perfect for a girls movie night.",1453680000,,257,3.690909090909091

6258732,5,B00ID75XF4,All four DVDs are on separate discs just all packaged into one case. A great deal for four hilarious romantic comedies!!,1438387200,,120,4.761904761904762
6258733,5,B00ID75XF4,"here's the deal, i wanted to own ""What's Your Number"", because, Chris Evans. So i go on Amazon and see if i can watch it free, included with prime. i can't, so i check out how much it would be to own it digitally, it was like twelve bucks...that seemed steep for a few years old rom-com. i could rent it digitally through amazon, but then it's like four bucks and i only have it for like two days, and c'mon, it's chris evans, i'll want to watch it more than that. i could buy the dvd of just that movie for about five bucks, which i guess is ok, but then i came across this. for only eight bucks, i get four movies, at least 3 of which i'll definitely watch over and over (i'm not a huge fan of ""What Happens in Vegas"" but i can see it being a nice diversion on occasion). FOUR cute, sweet, silly movies for less than the price of one. even if you only want one of these movies, it makes sense to buy this, because chances are you'll like at least one of the other ones too. it's less than the price of a movie ticket, for four movies. if you are looking to buy one of these movies, i suggest just getting this instead of just one.",1434585600,4,1132,3.9911894273127753
6258734,4,B00ID75XF4,"I bought this for Bride Wars, the other movies were just a bonus. Not the most original movies-pretty predictable- but they're good romantic comedies to watch when you want something light.",1428019200,,189,5.129032258064516

8641044,4,B00ID75XF4,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning. The 27 Dresses / Bride Wars / What Happens in Vegas / What's Your Number Quadruple Feature was a must have in our collection, especially for $13. This was an unbeatable price for 4 classic wedding themed movies. Individually, these movies would have cost a total of almost $30. All 4 of these titles were great to put on and watch while working on our guest list or seating chart. They are all light hearted, laugh out loud funny, romantic comedies. This would make a great gift for any newly engaged couple or a wishing well gift at a bridal shower. I definitely recommend this collection for any soon to be married couple.

My opinion is 100% my own - good or bad. I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the ""helpful"" button!",1475712000,3,1015,4.486486486486487
