One of the biggest errors appeared in the second disc when presidents from the state of Ohio were being discussed. The narrator said that three presidents from Ohio died in office when there were actually four (Harrison, Garfield, McKinley and Harding). Also, one of the supposed three that died in office was said to be Rutherford B. Hayes. Actually, Hayes died years after leaving office, so I thought this was a pretty gross inaccuracy.

Despite this, the series is still very well put together. It's both entertaining and informative!",1453766400,,715,4.958333333333333

8526414,5,B0089PZC0G,This dvd set is great for my 7th grade geography class. It came with the first season of how the states got their shapes and was a great deal. I would recommend this anywhere from grades 6-9.,1397520000,,191,4.1891891891891895
