8171564,5,B000MRMEV4,"I love Patricia Rozema's work, no matter what she directs or writes. I rented this movie about 20 years ago from the old Scarecrow Video store in Wallingford, near Seattle.  It was an impulsive pick, and a lucky one. Although I only saw it that once, this movie has never left me. I was as impressed by it as I was by Rozema's ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing"" and ""When Night Falls."" Beautiful films, appropriate for LGBT audiences and everyone else.",1402876800,2,451,4.567901234567901
