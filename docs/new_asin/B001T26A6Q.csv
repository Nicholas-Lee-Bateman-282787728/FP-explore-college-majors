8340360,4,B001T26A6Q,"The story of Don Quixote de la Mancha is very old, and often re-told. There's even a musical version: The Man of la Mancha. Both broadway and film. The movie is available as a video and the soundtrack of the stage version is also out on CD with Richard Kiley singing the Don.
THIS film, with Feodor Chaliapin is a classic. Chaliapin was as famous an opera star as it was possible to be in his day. He does a great job in this early movie as the famous Don. Originally also duplicated in French, and once available on VHS with both language versions. This one is English only. With music by an equally famous French composer, this is a must-have for lovers of classic movies.",1241740800,,674,4.357142857142857
