8327632,3,B001NOQ8GW,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the release, so average: 3 stars

The ""Equator"" series is a wonderfully filmed, written and narrated nature series. In quality is matches, if not surpasses, the later and much more hyped ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" series's. Unfortunately, the producers and/or distributors did not market it as successfully. As to the DVD releases, they also made a few blunders:

1. the cover of these DVDs are too gaudy, it makes one think of them as cheap children films. But they are not; they are professionally made nature shows.
2. they did not release them as a box set. In fact, it is very hard to find all the DVDs in the same series.

There are:
1) Power of an Ocean: The Galapagos and Palmyra ...
2) Battle for the Light: The rainforests of South East Asia ...
3) Rivers of the Sun: The mighty Amazon River ...
4) Paradox of the Andes: In Ecuador the equatorial sun ...
5) Reef of Riches: tropical jungle and on the coral reef ...
6) Challenge of Change > the Great Rift Valley ...

One day I will add all of these to my collection.

Note to Discovery: please release a box set of Bluray DVDs!",1292025600,2,1119,4.360576923076923
8327633,3,B001NOQ8GW,"Picture quality well below average at places. Disc has two main subjects: Palmyra atoll in the pacific and Galapagos Islands. The coconut crab sequence (Palmyra atoll) very nice, but the Galapagos sequences dissappointing, especially if you have already watched ""Galapagos"" with Tilda Swinton. Disc not recommended on account of the really bad picture quality at places.",1247443200,11,370,5.625
8327634,1,B001NOQ8GW,"""Equator"" is an entertaining six-part series that aired on television (HD Theater) several times since 2006. It's being released on individual DVD's at $20 a pop, making this by far the most expensive nature series ever offered on amazon.com.

This ridiculous packaging policy is an affront to purchasers. My advice is to wait and buy the entire set for a reasonable price when it shows up on ebay or through amazon's resale vendors.",1231286400,6,433,4.931506849315069
