5909349,5,B00EECWCCE,"In the Hyperbole of Oppenheimer creating the mathematical proof of Atomic Weapons, the Protagonist in this film shows the struggle between doing what is Right and doing what is Right for your Country. Even faced with a certain dilemma, between Money, Fame, Ivory Tower Life, Extortion and losing everything but remaining grounded to humanity....he still must choose.

In this very interesting tale of the Man and Machine, would you be able to see the ""Bigger Picture""?

This is a MUST Watch movie, even if you don't understand the Mathematics in this movie (although I do, and it helps some), you will still understand the struggle, and end up rooting for the Protagonist even without the usual blood and hand to hand combat in most movies today!!",1401494400,38,747,4.920634920634921

5909355,5,B00EECWCCE,"Four top American mathematicians gather in a room upon completion of their solution to the heretofore impossible solution to the P vs NP problem, specifically that P = NP. An addendum has been added to the solution that one mathematician, a Fields Medalist named Tim Horton, sees as a breach of contract. The government spokesman offers each $10 million to approve the concluding document. Horton objects to the addendum, insisting their names be removed as authors to avoid scapegoating; further he wants the proof of P = NP to be awarded and assigned to the four mathematicians present who developed it. The government man states any modification to the contract constitutes a breach, and all funding will be immediately removed. At a seeming impasse, Horton states that he neglected to complete the proof, and without its completion, he can make it fail on a global scale. Those present do not believe him.",1515283200,,909,4.9868421052631575
5909356,4,B00EECWCCE,"Very good! _Travelling Salesman_ is an interesting movie, shot on low budget. It asks the characters to consider whether P is equal to NP. The characters' P problem is whether to sign away their super-algorithm; their NP problem is whether they have enough time to consider and verify the implications of their decision.

_Travelling Salesman_  takes its name from one type of ""P versus NP"" problem. One remarkable aspect of the traveling salesman problem in ""P versus NP"" form is that some people can solve the problem in polynomial time whereas an algorithm cannot. (See the end of the movie.)

It's the rare kind of movie that tries to show an abstract topic through a flesh-and-blood confrontation. Though not as perfect as _Copenhagen_, this movie keeps interest and grapples with the moral consequences of pure innovation. The scriptwriters stack the deck a bit, by making the NSA seem too thuggish and the mathematicians too pure.

Not to worry. Even if a computer crypto-superkey were invented, the world would not crash and burn. Information-theoretic security systems exist which can not be ""solved"" even if the ""codebreaker"" has unlimited computational time. For example, there's the old-fashioned, Cold War ""one-time pad,"" which is, as far as anyone knows, quantum computer-proof.",1515024000,,1292,5.2270531400966185

It does belabor the central point of the movie, that the world basically runs on computers in modern days, a bit though. Nonetheless, the film draws you in, once you get settled into the rhythm of it, and you can't help but wonder what is going to happen to the main character at the end.
But, the ending. Oh, the ending. Perhaps it was just a final... attempt... to cram in one last topical reference and allude to the mythology that hovers around the, unfortunate, conspiratorial nonsense that is sometimes attributed to the intersection of higher knowledge and government. Or perhaps it was just a cheap thrill for the target audience. In any case, it was not done well and detracts from this otherwise well crafted story.

This type of thing can be done very well (for instance, watch ""The Man from Earth"") but the writer and director of this film did not do it well. I'm sorry, but most of it is boring.

5909383,5,B00EECWCCE,"Wow!!! What an unusual and intelligent movie. If you hold a degree in a STEM field (I hold a B.S., M.S., and Ph. D.), you simply MUST see this movie. If you do, I think you'll agree with me that as an example of the science fiction genre, this movie is a horse of a different color.

What I liked best about this movie was what made it most unusual: the excellent and BELIEVABLE depiction of the technical people, the four mathematicians. The way the mathematician characters talked, the way they looked, their mannerisms, etc. were BELIEVABLE. I don't know how the producers of this movie accomplished this feat, while in every other sci-fi or sci-fact movie I've ever seen the science characters smelled phony.(Sorry, Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" did not look, talk, or behave like any mathematician I've ever known.) That's not to say that the actors in this movie weren't a bit ""over the top"" -- the actors did cross the line into caricature at times. But that's OK in my book. It's the difference between watching a documentary and watching a dramatic depiction. The actors in a drama always need to ratchet it up a little vis--vis real life.

SPOILER ALERT: Stop reading now if you want to avoid the plot spoilers below.

As much as I want to congratulate the producers for daring to make such a wonderful, highbrow movie about a highly technical subject, I do have to point out a glaring error that was (apparently) an attempt to be cinematic rather than realistic. Much of the movie revolves around what appears to be a classified discussion THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN A SCIF. (The work under discussion was portrayed as Top Secret/SCI.)  The room portrayed in the movie had a large picture window, which means, of course, it could not have been a SCIF. Moreover, no real SCIF would contain an ""oddjob"" character (whose role, I guess, was to look threatening) sitting in the room near the door and apparently having no technical relationship to the project under discussion.

Other realism failures included:

1. The Horton character is supposedly world famous, yet his university does not even provide him a private office(!!!???)

2. Horton was inappropriately and unrealistically chatty about his Top Secret/SCI project with his office mate, the latter evidently not read into the project. Moreover, mention of the project outside the SCIF would have been taboo anyway, even if the office mate had been read into the project.

3. At the end of the movie, Horton apparently triggers Armageddon by typing a few lines into his computer (via a dumb 1980s-vintage ASCII terminal interface -- I guess that was more cinematic than something modern). With this sequence, the movie veers at the end into standard sci-fi Hollywoodism. But hey, the previous 98% of the movie was way outside the standard sci-fi genre, and 98% is a pretty high proportion.",1483315200,,2866,4.83469387755102

5909388,3,B00EECWCCE,"Probably worth watching at least once if you're a computer scientist, mathematician, or something similar, as it addresses what is commonly accepted to be the most important unsolved problem in computer science, but this movie definitely is NOT for the layperson. Furthermore, even though I, a CS student, found it interesting, I still realize that the movie could've been far better.

5909396,1,B00EECWCCE,"I'm a computer scientist, and I like thought-provoking movies with big ideas. From the description, it sure sounded like this was going to be right up my alley. The implications of proving P=NP would indeed be vast ones, certain almost every aspect of our lives and our societies.

But you don't get many of those implications in this movie. You barely get an explanation of what the problem is, much less the classic example from which this movie gets its title.
(SPOILERS follow!)
What you get is four mathematicians/computer scientists in a room. For an interminable while, they argue about the ""addendum"" to their report, glower at each other, and argue cryptically about the work and their professional rivalries. Then the government representative, looking like Rob Lowe, finally shows up, and the rest of the movie the mathematicians argue some more, mostly with him but also between themselves. The same points are hammered on repeatedly, and they are not the far-reaching conjectures I was expecting, but instead boil down to this: the government wants to keep these results private, and the mathematicians are worried that they will use it to break Chinese cryptography. I kept waiting for more, but that's about the extent of the implications that are pondered: the government would render its enemies' computer systems completely transparent, and could do bad things with that power.
Oh, and the mathematicians are concerned that the much-discussed addendum (which discusses practical implications, while the main body of the paper is just the abstract mathematical results) could be used to make scapegoats of them, should the results turn out bad.
That's it, aside from some flashbacks, the most boring parts of a lecture (like the introduction of the speaker!), and an ending that (thankfully) takes places out of the meeting room and features one of the only two characters who not aren't entirely annoying, who wraps up the problem in exactly the manner he threatened to earlier in the film.

If you can suspend the need to know exactly what it is and can accept the explanation just simply at face value of what it means, i.e. it's significance is (some calculations or problems can be done in even ""infinite"" time) you will do much better and likely enjoy the issues, if not be frightened by the implications.

5909401,1,B00EECWCCE,"I was not expecting anything going into this, and I certainly was not disappointed in my expectations.  Admittedly I was hoping for something a little more ""exciting"" -  say on the order of watching a dog chase it's tail, or even a cat chasing a laser dot - but I didn't really expect anything.  This might have been more thrilling if we could have just watched someone paint the walls and then quietly observed the paint as it dried.

But there was action: a presumed student brought a paper into the office, a mysterious figure tightened a screw against the lead character's head (but only in his imagination).  There was unresolved intrigue: was the guard the mysterious ""enforcer""?  What is ""P""? What is ""NP""? And how does anything about this film relate to the title?

It has pretty much always been my perception that mathematicians - and especially theoretical mathematicians - are engaged in the pursuit of mental self-gratification and therefore produce a suspected product, i.e. nothing.  Therefore if these people are actually paid anything at all it is a gross over-payment.

While my above statement may seem harsh, I am only considering the problems of the world that could be solved by brilliant minds but go unsolved in favor of finding ""solutions"" to problems that only they pose.  I have no patience with people who tout themselves as being geniuses yet can not prove that by their deeds.  If they are so smart, why are we still destroying our atmosphere with fossil fuels?  Why have we unleashed the power of the atom to create waste that cannot be recycled?  Why are there still deserts when the planet has ample water?  Why are we searching the stars for intelligent life while ignoring the many forms of intelligent life surrounding us on our own planet?  Are we hoping to carry on a multi-generational conversation with mathematicians on other planets possibly in galaxies that are lifetimes away?

5909413,1,B00EECWCCE,"I'm still waiting for a good math movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind/dp/B00ENYKLIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind</a>&nbsp;was half math, tops, and its story and emotional progress came from the schizophrenia and recovery, not the math.

On the bright side, ""Travelling Salesman"" wants to make a moral argument between four ""mathematicians"" into something worth watching. Points for earnestness and ambition. And, the movie correctly asserts that proving P = NP would create a mathematical revolution that would upend many parts of modern life. It even kinda-sorta explains what P and NP are, so that's nice. It's not 100% wrong.

That's about all for the bright side.

With apologies to other reviewers who were impressed with the movie's math chops -- the movie is, on the whole, mathematically out to lunch. It's at least 98% wrong. It asks us to believe that after years of collaborating on research, these four top-tier mathematicians would prepare a comprehensive paper on their findings without ever once pausing to discuss the implications of their (allegedly) apocalyptic breakthrough? Yes, the movie tries to address this oddity, but its explanation not only doesn't hold water -- it is absurd. The conceit behind 95% of the screen time is preposterous.

Furthermore, the claimed apocalypse wouldn't be truly apocalyptic -- just highly, highly inconvenient. Even if P were proved to be a subset of NP, it wouldn't ruin all forms of cryptography, just those that use asymmetric keys. I won't explain the difference here, but suffice to say: while the movie is right to suggest that P = NP would make most of today's security obsolete (emphasis on ""most"" and ""today's""), it wouldn't wipe out all future alternatives. For example, ""one-time pad ciphers"" are provably secure, now and forever. Mathematicians at this level (and most well-trained undergraduates, for that matter) would realize this. Timothy Lanzone, the movie's director and co-writer? Not so much.

Math aside, the movie-as-movie is equally flawed. The dialog is stilted; interruptions and cryptic* academic oneupmanship pass for drama. The cinematography is proficient but heavy handed: how many closeups of a loudly ticking clock are necessary, really? (If your answer is fewer than nine, look elsewhere.) The four ""mathematicians"" have actor-quality hair, the government heavy has movie-star hair and jawline, and the security thug has a mullet and a twitchy sneer. The shots around the science-y conference room tables are washed so monotonously gray-blue that at one point, the glimpse of a pale manila folder in the G-man's portfolio seems like a splash of springtime color.

Let us not even begin to speak of the culturally-ignorant-if-not-backward politics of a movie about the morality of genius-level science which doesn't have a single character who is female, non-white, or even speaks English with a non-American accent. The Bechdel Index of this movie is, apparently and appropriately, one divided by zero.

How thoroughly non-technical is this movie? Even though the movie has all-American accents, its title uses the British spelling instead of the American one-L spelling, i.e., ""traveling."" If you're not a mathematician, that mistake might not bother you.

Still into science-y flicks?

Case in point, the current popularity of the idea that we are the villians for the atomic bombs in WW2.  Never mind it probably saved around a million lives after, but it's like Japan was just sitting minding their own business and we decided to test a weapon on them. Google Japanese atrocities in ww2 and see what they were doing to Chinese civilians. They were slaughtering and raping by the millions. Oh yeah, THEY STARTED the war with us.

5909449,5,B00EECWCCE,"TSalesman mirrors almost exactly the moral/ethical questions being secretly debated at Los Alamos (Manhattan Project) as the project was nearing its goalthat of detonating a nuclear fueled, chain reaction explosion. At the time, most of the physicists understood the implications of what they were creating. In fact, even Teller knew when he wrote his letter to President Roosevelt that kicked the whole thing into high gear, what the implications were. Remember, the scientists did not ask the US to build a bomb. Instead, they suggested that one was, in fact, possible to build and that the Germans might be trying to build one (though no one knew how to build one with contemporary technology). The idea seems to have come to the military minds in Britain and the US that if one were really possible, then they must have it and have it first! The scientists were brought along out of necessity and they all willingly joined in the effort to get one to the test stage at least.

In this movie, a great reference is made to the Manhattan project and outlines what happened to the leading scientist in charge of the project and perhaps, more than anyone else was responsible for its successful construction.. Oppenheimer was crucified by the very government he helped save. One must ask Why?. The answer to that question is keenly answered in this film by the Government Agent who so clearly and directly threatens Dr. Horton, his career and his family.

I actually expected the Mysterious Man quietly sitting and observing, to suddenly, quick step forward and simply shoot one of the scientists right through the head as an example of how important this was to the government. Or, for the film to end with all the scientists arrested by goons that storm into the room, place them in cuffs and black bags over their heads and march them off to some obscure lifetime incarceration. Thats how sinister the all powerful government types have become. I think Ed Snowden (who the film obliquely referred to) is damn lucky to be alive today.

Overall, I think just about anyone can understand there was something created that was terribly important to the government and that there was a highly sinister force at work to keep them and their remarkable accomplishment a secret forever. You do not need to hold a PhD to understand the conflict here.  Also, it was refreshing to watch a whole movie with out some ridiculous heroic females interjecting themselves into the plot with twin machine guns blazing away.",1461888000,4,2504,4.857142857142857

5909458,4,B00EECWCCE,"This is definitely a movie aimed more at the intellectual who can appreciate a good conversation. It will introduce you to the mathematical concept of P = NP as it pertains to computer science, which poses the question of whether a problem that a computer can check quickly for correctness can also be solved just as quickly.

The movie plays out under the notion that the answer to that question is yes, P does equal NP which means that quickly verifiable problems can also be quickly solved. It provides an interesting perspective on a topic that you'll probably have no one to talk about with since it's really requires a bit of knowledge of both math and computers to understand why P vs NP is a significant problem.

My personal opinion is that as far as binary computers go P does not equal NP, and hashing functions like MD5 and SHA provide a simple ""proof"" of this. You can generate a unique hash (string of alphanumeric characters) of this entire review text, and that hash string will always end up the same when the unchanged text is hashed.

If P did equal NP, then knowing the hash string would allow a person to reconstruct the original data that generated the hash. This is not possible to do, at least not with a linear/binary computer, because a hash is a unique identifier of data but it offers no specifics as to what the original data actually was.",1460678400,2,1368,4.5528455284552845

But I'm over 30 minutes into it, and so far the TOPIC of the movie hasn't been discussed yet.  There's been lots of discussion about what the characters should discuss.  There's been discussion about an""addendum,"" but neither the ""addendum"" itself nor what it is an addendum of have been discussed.  There's been discussion about one of the meeting attendees being late.  There's been discussions about the ""great implications"" -- of something.  There's even been a fascinating discussion about how the meeting attendees will be paid.  (Paid for what?  Research into what?)  Oh, and the word ""nondeterministic"" has been tossed out a few times, which must mean that this is a Really Great Movie.

It's rather like a movie about striptease, in which the stripper never reveals anything, and in fact the stripper never shows up -- at least not in the first 30 minutes of the movie.  Instead there are endless discussions about the stripper's costume, her compensation, and her tardiness.  Sound interesting?

Going out on a limb here, but one might think that a movie about an ""important"" math concept might actually explain WHAT THE CONCEPT IS at some point in the first half hour.  But in this case one would be mistaken.

For many years I thought that the book Moby Dick, with its endless digressions on tar, ropes, and harpoon heads, was the most boring text ever written.  That was before I saw this movie.  This movie's script could be used as anesthesia before surgical procedures, except that the boredom it induces might prove fatal.  The prospective viewer might consider taking up smoking in order to give himself something useful to do while this movie drags its limp ""nondeterministic"" carcass across his TV screen.

But really, this was fascinating to watch. The meeting's group dynamics alone made this movie worth my time.

My background is in psychology, education, and IT. Although I'm not particularly advanced on the IT security side of it, a quick read on Wikipedia about the basic nature of the P vs NP dilemma gave me the foundational knowledge required to understand the crux of the issue addressed in the movie...the ""why this is an issue"" part.

I also enjoyed the creative logic, the way the main character's thoughts would step away from the problem and see it from a larger perspective in order to solve the problem by making it irrelevant.

All the shaky camera shots gave the movie an interesting feel, but also was distracting at times. And I would have enjoyed being given a little more insight on the mathematics behind the P vs NP issue, but that might have made the movie too challenging for a Saturday night of chilling on Amazon Prime.

Overall, I'm glad I watched it. I can see, however, that this movie requires a rather specific audience. The characters' vocabulary is sophisticated and even, in my opinion, titillating--their conversations flowed in a natural fashion with a realistic feel, and the script shows a lot of confidence in the audience to follow the train of thought, both challenging us on moral issues and amusing us with unusual connections of ideas.

The cinematography and direction was an exercise in acute affectation, which just ends up being distracting. Overuse of hand-held shooting to make something feel more artistic is the refuge of the film school amateur, and the shot of the fence was meaningless art house goonery.

The story was generally boring to the point of being exhausting, just watching a bunch of scientists argue the ethical aspects of their grand discovery. I would've like to have seen it 50-50 with flashback scenes from each of their actual work toward the discovery, and the B stories that went along with that. There were no side arcs, which made the whole thing lack robustness.

The mathematicians' discovery was to be the single most important since someone first struck fire, and disappointingly everyone involved was male and white. In fact, I believe the entire cast was. How ironic to make a film with such a strong social message, and to so thoroughly miss the mark on such an obvious social issue. Representation is important.

And I'm not entirely sure what the ending meant, but  without dropping any spoilers  I didn't buy it. I didn't buy the protagonist's motivations, nor his ultimate actions, especially considering the inevitable repurcussions.

Just know that the result of the work done on the problem is unchecked and ubiquitous power, and that the group of mathematicians at the center of the debate are struggling with what that implies.

5909550,1,B00EECWCCE,"The plot of this movie:  four guys hired by the NSA have discovered a super-duper hacking algorithm against which
there is no defense,  and the NSA wants to keep it secret and use it for their own purposes, bribing and threatening the four guys
in a long conversation.  These ""scientists"" communicate like junior high school students, using profanities and shouting.
They compare their work to the Manhattan project and worry if they'll be blamed later if it's put to an evil use.
We are supposed to believe that the super-duper hacking algorithm depends on a positive solution to P=NP,  and
the audience is not much enlightened about that problem,  but it doesn't matter as the plot really doesn't depend on it at all.
That is, the mention of P=NP is completely gratuitous and irrelevant to the plot.  It won't matter whether you understand that problem or not.
The movie will be equally bad either way.  The script is juvenile and pointless.  The acting is bland;  such emotion as the actors
valiantly try to project is not believable, given the unbelievable nature of the script, and the utterly unconvincing dialog.  Nor does
the script writer deserve all the blame;  the directing and cinematography are also hopelessly flawed.  The director has watched too
much film noir.  The subtitles declare ""ominous music""  at least a third of the time the movie is playing,  yet nothing ever happens,  except
one bad dream in which a guy with a Japanese mask on applies a torture device to someone's head.  Otherwise it's talking heads the whole time.
The director thought it appropriate to show some of the talking heads jerking about quite a bit as if it were hard to focus;  and many are in
black and white or bluish shades,  perhaps to make it seem ""ominous"".  If my kid made this film in a junior high school cinema class  I would applaud at the performance,  I guess,  but if adults made this film, it's time for a career change.",1448236800,,1931,4.7155688622754495

The dialogue charges forward at an exciting pace for much of the movie. Unfortunately, the execution of this piece of filmmaking suffers from less-than-optimal editing and muddy characterization. The third act resolution hinges on the main characters expressing their motivations for why they are doing what they do. But those motivations don't quite clearly follow from their previous arguments and viewpoints. Some of the dialogue is repetitive and too dry--even for a science thriller. And the editing causes the film to have a slow beginning that may utterly confuse and bewilder some audience members to the point where they turn off the show before it gets to the good parts.

Despite this, the movie is quite enjoyable if you are into ""smart thrillers"" as one reviewer described it, and willing to sit through the first 20 minutes. The filmmakers (brothers I guess?) clearly know how to escalate the stakes and keep the willing viewer hooked. And they have some very cool ideas here, like the scene about searching the desert for a coin.

5909640,3,B00EECWCCE,"This film is an immensely enjoyable treatment of a topic that is well-known to students of mathematics and physical science. As mentioned by other reviewers, the topic deals with societal implications if humans could solve difficult problems in an almost arbitrarily easy way. Think back to junior high school and the quadratic equation. If someone gives you two roots of a second-order polynomial equation, then you can substitute these roots into the equation and verify the solution easily. Now imagine that you could find the roots just as easily as you could verify them, and that this same idea applied to harder problems such as finding how to decipher codes and resolve any problem that can be solved by an *algorithmic* approach.

You don't need mathematics to enjoy this film. Just think of it as follows:

  1) It's like a secret agent movie where the agents have found a ""secret formula"" that could be used for good and bad because it could make it
  hard to keep any information hidden or protected - military deployment plans, banking transfers, other research results, names of people in
  witness protection plans...

  2) If we removed the inability to conceal information, then would this produce a more adversarial world?

  3) If one group of researchers could make information almost impossible to conceal, what would they do with this ability?

So it's kind of like a spy movie where the secret agents are trying to get a ""secret formula"" that will give their country or sponsors a big advantage, except that in this case the ""secret formula"" is a weapon that gives the possessors ""x-ray eyes"".

Like in a secret agent movie, you *do* have to suspend some disbelief here. The question ""P = NP?"" remains an open question in mathematics, but an affirmative answer to the question does *NOT* give the secret to deciphering and other problems unless the proof is a ""constructive"" proof - that is, the proof shows the answer to P = NP? and *also* tells you how to build the applications that allow you to solve the problems you are interested in. In this film, they indicate that they have done that: they not only show that P = NP, they also have applied the result to problems that would be important to industry and government. The suspension of (some) disbelief is required because many researchers in computational complexity believe that N does not equal NP - that is, it is NOT true that problems that can easily be verified can be solved with about as much effort (informally stated, all apologies to professional mathematicians :)).

In all, a good secret agent flick about what ""big brother"" might be doing to you some day! And it's great to have a spy film that has a higher word density than gunshot density! :)

One final word...if you like stories that deal with the possibility that ""machines/computers will become self-aware and subjugate Mankind"", then you will probably like this. You could see themes of this film as a possible way to battle the machines, or as a warning that the machines will be able to control our world easier than Artificial Intelligence researchers fear! :)

Enjoy the film.

5909642,5,B00EECWCCE,"Alright, I am gonna do a little review, just to raise one counterpoint to the repeated claims that this film has a prerequisite.

I am not a software developer, nor am I a mathematician. I just have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and have dabbled in C, C++, java (sorry), and I read an odd little book on the ML language for fun (it really wasn't all that fun).

I am certain that I enjoyed the story a little more because I have a little background in Linear Algebra (because: proofs), and coding (because: determinism).

However, all the traditional aspects of film performance still hold up in my opinion.
The writing is smart and as far as I can tell accurate.
The dialog and every actor's timing is excellent.
Editing, shot framing, and sound are all good.
Some of the extended monologues are some of the best I have seen, ever.
Everyone in this film can hold the camera for a super long time without dropping the moment. Especially Mr. Barclay.

So, after all that, my point is this: You may or may not have a clue what P versus NP means. However, if you are just a fan of watching really well done dramatic dialog, you are going to enjoy this film.",1441411200,10,1160,4.431924882629108

The discussion between the 4 mathematicians and the government's liason was the most interesting part but was only a small part of the movie. What destroys the movie is the ending which is childish. Would you sell out your family, friends and future to destroy something that could keep the world balanced? That a genius would be that stupid and ignorant of the fact that if they could solve the problem then why could not the other side also solve the problem?

The whole thing is shot in monochrome, to emphasize the gravitas. And gravitas there is.. aplenty.

How evil is the government?

I had no idea what this P vs. NP thing was all about so I googled it.........ha ha ha, it started going on about quadratic and linear whatever and all kinds of high minded stuff meant for the realm of the hyper intelligent.

I decided to watch this anyway since it was free and obviously something of more worth than the usual B horror insanity I generally kill time with; and with no expectations of comprehending or even appreciating any of this.

I still don't know what this algorithm or whatever it is all about but it seems to me that this P vs NP thing is irrelevant.

The film follows an old formulae that was popular about 25 - 30 years back wherein brilliant scientists make an extraordinary breakthrough that will benefit humanity blah blah blah, and then the govt. steps in and claims it for their own because the Pentagon footed all the bills.
And then the noble academicians fight tooth and nail to preserve the integrity of their discovery and keep it out of the ands of big bad govt. and the audience cheers. The film ""Brainstorm"" comes to mind.

The producers have been only partially successfully in applying this premise as the foundation for this movie and breathing new insights and perspectives in light of present day post 9-11 realities; but then they stumble by suggesting that the one dissenting scientist might actually be able to outdo the teams work in a game of one up-manship and ""live off the grid"" after he has performed an unthinkable act.
Here, the logic of the script conveniently breaks down in order to achieve the so-called ""happy ending"" for the naive geek ""Matrix"" crowd, even after the director has gone through great pains to convey the futility of the rogue scientist's ambitions.

In doing so the film has also compromised it's own artistic merit which is a shame because for awhile it was getting quite interesting; the dialogue is superlative.",1429488000,2,1976,4.68299711815562

This movie has a group of four mathematicians who have made a crucial discovery and are debating what should be done about it with a government agent. Very tense, very melodramatic. It's a bit confusing, they are never clear about what exactly they've discovered but it is clear that whatever it is is incredibly powerful.

In this movie the shaky cam is emblematic of the problems with the film's whole approach to its subject.  It is trying too hard to convince you that it's a realistic depiction of the issues it discusses so that the thing comes off more like someone made an afterschool special using a bad TED talk as an outline.

5909856,3,B00EECWCCE,"The premise was a good idea.  Two stars are for the movie and an additional one is for the premise.  Basically, the US government gathers up 4 mathematicians asks them to solve the Traveling Salesman problem, or more generally try to find a way to convert NP problems into P problems so that rather than taking all the world's computers 500 years to solve, the problem can be solved by a single computer in a reasonable amount of time.  This is a real unsolved problem in Computer Science: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem

So, fascinating, right?  How does the movie play out?  The 4 men sit around the table waiting for the official to arrive so they can discuss their findings, but he's late, so they supposedly begin doing the final analysis before he arrives. The discussions give the appearance of intelligent conversation going on by having everyone say things we often hear in intelligent arguments. ""We can take all the premises put forth as given.""  ""I disagree.  We can not. They might seem established but it's worthwhile to question them."" Some really stupid things happen, like they're supposed to be in a Top Secret area but one guy takes out his cellphone is told by his colleague that he can't have that in the room.  Duh... You would have been told to leave that before you entered the area and the fact you revealed you had it would've lead to confiscation of the phone, etc.
Then the government official comes in and gives everyone compensation that is pretty droolworthy, spend a solid hour having a dumb argument over how their findings are going to be used -- the premise is good, so the findings that they made would in real life be nearly as valuable as they say they are in the movie -- and the government official essentially saying that they agreed beforehand that their findings would belong to the government.  (Once again, duh.  Unless you actually make prior explicit agreement with your employer, you can assume you're not allowed to make anything you've created outside available outside of the entity.  Many businesses and the government will actually have that in the contract you signed when you were hired.)

Spoilers beyond this point:
The mathematician with the best haircut reveals he has a way to ""shut down"" all their prior work and that it has not been included with the work they submitted.  He becomes a vigilante and carries out his threat to put a stop all the work they've created.  Then a mysterious masked figure comes into his house and kills him in a very painful way.

Point of the whole movie:  Mathematics is noble and all findings should be shared with the World.  It's a moral obligation.  Also, Uncle Sam is evil and thinks it's funny that you were picked on as a little kid.",1423872000,2,2758,4.768421052631579

5909862,3,B00EECWCCE,"There are several ways one might critique this film.  From a technical viewpoint, I agree with some of the one-star reviewers that the camera work stinks.  It is obviously low-budget.  The sets are common, I'm still not sure of the significance of having most of the film set near a train track. Perhaps a symbol of technology that is eventually lost, shut down in the techno-collapse, freeing the protagonist to walk unafraid down the railroad tracks without fear of being run over by a train?  It is a stretch.

From a premise standpoint, I thought the film pretty good.  Exploring the implications of solving an NP Complete problem, theoretically solving them all, is certainly a good use for science fiction.  (Or, Math fiction if that's a separate genre.)  I think that the film could have had a little more action.  Building suspense in such a slow manner makes most people want to abandon the film.  Expecting an audience to invest the kind of work that it takes to understand the issues, then not rewarding them with a consistent fast-paced plot is not very respectful.  It tends to leave one feeling that their time has been wasted.  It almost justifies the complaint of many that math is boring.

The one physical action sequence that was included makes no sense.  It has no consequences and we see a replay of the scene in which it disappears.  What's the point of that?

So, this is not top-shelf science fiction like Interstellar, that's what I'd call 5 stars.  Neither is it 2nd tier science fiction, like the Tommy Knockers.  No, this is definitely third-tier, that's why I gave it 3 stars.",1422835200,,1605,4.7328519855595665
5909863,1,B00EECWCCE,"This entire movie is silly because the""NP might also be P"" problem isn't a Game Changer.  That fact is, many have written heuristic programs that can get with within a couple of percent of optimum for a real world NP hard problem.  Once you're within a couple of percent, most of the time in the real world, it's PLENTY good enough.  And if it's not, you can then eliminate the results that are outliers and far outside the range of possibility to decrease the next result set and use an NP solver to get there in far less than O(n!) time.  (There are certain no-go combinations that can simply be thrown out.) NP problems that might take 20 year of CPU time can be condensed into a few minutes, or even seconds because most of the potential junk answers (and sectional junk path / node combinations) are excluded before the second pass.  Math people spend too much time thinking about elegance, and often overlook the obvious.",1422662400,2,927,4.5602409638554215
5909864,2,B00EECWCCE,"For all the math technical terms they name dropped (almost for no reason at times) this movie was just commentary about government appropriation of academic research.  It can be applied to any field you like, its the same general idea.

That itself wasn't too bad from a theoretical discussion, but as the movie continues onward the direct takes the discussion from the theoretical perspective to just outright silliness (I'll avoid spoilers but there's symbolism near the end of the film that would have caused me to stop watching if they had shown it much earlier).  I get that some films are made to illustrate a personal opinion but the film starts off as marketing itself that it would be a discussion not ""one stance is obviously right the others are not"".

From a visual perspective I found the other scenes (outside of the boardroom) to be completely insignificant and just distract us from the fact its 5 people sitting at a table talking for 80 minutes.  Which again, would be ok, but it feels as if the director panicked at the end that his film would be ""too boring"" so had to add in other scenes elsewhere to give some kind of ""excitement"" to the film.  In essence, it felt like someone told him to add an addendum to the film because 55 minutes of just sitting at the glass table wasn't going to fly.  If there was studio pressure I'd understand it, but I doubt Fretboard Pictures is exerting the kind of influence to make this movie ""more mainstream"" that say Disney would.

For a pseudo-mathematics movie (in the same scope that Pi was) it holds its own (but there are very few in that category) and addresses the issue of create control of research, but ultimately this movie falls short as it tries to extend beyond the discussion portion to making its ""point"".  I expect to see further things from Timothy Lanzone as his films have had some traction, but I expect he will look back at this in his career and look at this as a learning project rather than one of his masterpieces.",1422576000,,1998,4.57422969187675
5909865,5,B00EECWCCE,"I absolutely LOVED THIS movie!!!  Initially the setting seems to be a poorly filmed conference. The speaker comes out and says they're having technical difficulties. Then it cuts to a room where the majority of the movie is set. Initially there are 5 men in the room who have been highly paid to work on a government project. When they come together they discuss an addendum which has been added to their original body of work, and the implications of the addendum, or whether they can be sure of the implications if any, and why they all weren't read in on this addendum.

Because these are all incredibly intelligent men, there's hardly enough space in the room for all the egos, and there are a lot of insults thrown around about who knows what, and whether anyone could possibly know what the future implications might be. It becomes clear that perhaps some are smarter than others, two definitely have more conscience and perhaps see the project for what it truly is.

Then another man joins the group, someone from the government, who's there to illicit signatures from these men. He pulls out the contracts, tells them they've been paid 22 million dollars, and for that they're expected to sign the normal confidentiality agreement, a non-disclosure agreement, etc...  The men start toying with him, and because he's not nearly their level of intelligence, he becomes very easily frustrated and angry. He's no fool, he just can't match wits with these men. They ask all sorts of questions regarding the moral implications of the project -- things they didn't feel they signed on for -- such as the using the work of other people but not giving them credit. Removing their names from the project -- so they'll have confidentiality. And more importantly, wondering exactly how the government intends to use their work -- for betterment or I'll.
After the mtg one of the men -- the one I thought was probably the most intelligent, was in his home, and started to run some code -- which he'd ill used to in the mtg. I have NO idea what it was but I'd like to know - everything seemed to go dark after it executed-- so I guess it wasn't good.

5909869,5,B00EECWCCE,"Wow! What a thought-provoking movie! As interesting as the ramifications of a P vs NP solution would be, I found the ethical and moral implications utterly profound. It reminded me of Jacob Bronowski's famous series of lectures at MIT (available in book form at Amazon) titled ""Science and Human Values"".

It also reminds me of the all-star movie ""Sneakers"" (Robert Redford, Dan Akyroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnel, River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier) where computer expert Martin Bishop (Redford) is faced with a similar dilemma whether or not to hand over a one-of-a-kind revolutionary microprocessor to our government that can overcome any encrypted security system, seemingly in real time.

Travelling Salesman has my highest recommendation and I think everyone should see it. If you are not a math wiz, please don't let its subject scare you away---the dialog does a fairly good job of describing in simple terms what the implications of a solution to this long-standing problem will mean. This is not the kind of movie to fret over the details of technology---it's very much a ""big picture"" kind of movie that asks us to take the long view and think about the outcome of our actions.

If you have trouble understanding the plot, see the aforementioned movie ""Sneakers"" because it deals with a very similar problem in a fun, exciting way. The real value of Travelling Salesman is in the moral issues that it raises. Such as: What is the responsibility and duty of the inventors of a technology that can not only do great good but also great harm? And: Does their responsibility to mankind supersede their political responsibility? Excellent, excellent movie!!!",1421452800,57,1661,5.076923076923077

The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science first posed by a letter by Godel in 1956, then introduced officially by Steven Cook in 1971 and has been a subject of controversy for all engineering and math disciplines since. As far as the video is concerned, if you are truly looking for pure knowledge about a very interesting subject, (especially students of ALL engineering disciplines, physics and mathematics) I recommend this one highly. However, I must warn the viewer that much of this video is taken from lectures and presentations by world renowned mathematicians and physicists and to the average lay person, the material will be very dry and boring. But if you want to LEARN SOMETHING, it will be possible because, for the most part, the speakers have toned their lectures down technically to a very comprehensible level so that all you have to do is LISTEN CAREFULLY without interruption to understand the principles being discussed there. If you're not willing to do that and go in with the wrong attitude, it's just going to be a boring, university style lecture series that yields little of value for you. However, you have an opportunity to take away the knowledge of controversy that is yet on-going and will most likely never be answered in our lifetime. I think the time is worth it!

I have agreed for years with the saying that ""A good story is a good story"", and this is one of those. If this were made with a higher budget and more recognizable actors, it would not be any better than this film is now - indeed, those higher production values might just detract from the experience.

If indeed the problem ""P=NP"" can be solved, the implications may or may not be devastating, but as allegory, that premise works just fine in the context of the story.

The problem with governments and people is they ""repeat"" history making the same stupid mistakes over and over again and again (no matter what technology is available). This movie is ""flawed"" in the same way as some recent Hollywood movies and major network TV shows which create these political films making America's past actions as BAD; leaving out the FACTS!

Go to Japan in 2014; they still ""value"" the sick ideology of Hitler; which is weird concerning none of them are blond with blue eyes ""genetically"" speaking. It's actually ""scary"". Just because we have the Internet and we are now supposedly ""global"" doesn't mean things have changed....in most cases...""nothing"" has changed.

This film is somewhat similar because it involves the solving of a computer science math problem called P vs NP (and no, P=NP does not mean P equals NP, it means P vs NP, look it up) which if solved could be used to break all of the encryption techniques currently used by browsers, banks, other corporations, government etc, and not just the US, but the whole world.  In other words, No More Secrets.

Don't get me wrong.  It is a very interesting and enthralling film.  It drew me in and kept me captivated.  But the film is strange, it starts with four mathematicians and a mystery guy sitting in a chair at one side of the room.  They're waiting on a representative from the DOD or NSA.  The mystery guy is never explained.  There are flashbacks that seem to have no real context when shown, but they do make a sort of sense at the end.  And the ending is very strange as well as the last mathematician is apparently letting loose a virus that supposed to shut the entire world down and return us to the dark ages.

The scenes in the meeting room, the discussions of the implications of solving the P vs NP problem, the ethics raised in the rather heated discussions with the government man, these are very well done and give the film a polished look.  The genuine emotion in those scenes is riveting.  But, the other scenes are less real, more like something seen on SyFy channel than a film released to theaters.

5909951,3,B00EECWCCE,"Not a mathematician so I won't pretend to address the deeply complex scientific issues involved or the ramifications of those issues. I can, however, address the ethical dilemmas underlying the central conflict of the film and remark on the purely cinematic aspects.

For one thing, the central character, the Fields Prize-winning mathematician whose name escapes me, poses a false dilemma in that he explicitly claims that mathematics is, of itself, transcendent; that is, its universality makes it above nation-states, above geopolitics, in a very real sense (according to him and presumably the filmmakers), the property of everyone. It isn't. Mathematics is like every other realm of human endeavor, and that which results from it or applied by it can be either a tool or a weapon.

Another thing: Robert Oppenheimer's famous agonizing over the consequences of the research done at Los Alamos and elsewhere was used as a parallel to the struggle with which the mathematicians in this movie were engaged, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were presented in the film as irredeemably morally wrong without question, in a way that would brook no argument. It should be pointed out that those bombings saved at least a million American lives and many more millions of Japanese lives. Those bombs ended the war.

I grew up during the Cold War and clearly remember the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, they of the famous Doomsday Clock. They were Oppenheimer's children in all but the physical sense: equally fearful of the fruits of their work and equally hyperbolic in the very public way they decried the military uses of their research. Preening moral pretension gets tiresome.

Another tiresome old trope? The slick but shadowy government guy who always shows up in movies like this, complete with menacing henchman and not-so-subtle threats.  To all filmmakers everywhere: retire this guy, please. And his henchman.

Hated the ending, by the way. Hated it. The guy who plays the moral center of the film takes a course of action that...oh, wait: that's the ending and I don't want to give it away.

So what's to like about this film? The fact that it thoughtfully, earnestly attempts to deal with serious ethical questions. Not enough of that going around.",1403136000,21,2273,5.07774798927614

This proof is a potential weapon more powerful, in the modern world,  than a hydrogen bomb. It can bypass any security system of any computer network on the planet, and these four men have cracked it and now the NSA have come for the final debriefing.

The movie is set mostly in one conference room and it documents the meeting of the four mathematicians and the NSA agent. There are no chases, no gun battles, no clichd computer hackers, no one dimensional villains. All of the fireworks are in the mind, the fundamental questions raised by the film make for riveting viewing.  It may be way too slow for some viewers, if you let the film take you on the cerebral ride, you won't be disappointed.  With all of the excesses of the NSA exposed in recent news reports, this movie couldn't be more topical.
