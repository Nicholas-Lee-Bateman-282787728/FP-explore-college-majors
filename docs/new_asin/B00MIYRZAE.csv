6583469,5,B00MIYRZAE,"Not a bad follow on to the prior ""Westworld"" and ""Futureworld"" classic sifi movies. Of course, it's all on a low cost TV series budget with old-school ""b-movie"" non CGI effects. Some will find this series somewhat boring or lacking in punch. For those that love the old school stuff for what it is, this should be part of your collection. Too bad the series was canceled. One wonders where it could have gone...  Maybe this series would be a good candidate for a reboot production (all puns intended).",1447372800,13,501,4.629213483146067

6583475,4,B00MIYRZAE,"After enduring decades of murky bootlegs, at long last the short-lived BEYOND WESTWORLD (1980) arrives on DVD!  The picture and sound quality of this MOD-DVD release is FANTASTIC!

BEYOND WESTWORLD; developed for television by Lou Shaw - based on ""Westworld"" (1973), created by Michael Crichton and its theatrical sequel ""Futureworld"" (1976).
Starring Jim McMullan as John Moore; James Wainwright as Simon Quaid; Connie Sellecca (""The Greatest American Hero"") as Pamela Williams and William Jordan (""Project: UFO"") as Professor Joseph Oppenheimer.
EPISODES:
1) WESTWORLD DESTROYED (03/05/80) - Guest Stars: Judith Chapman (""Galactica: 1980"" - The Return of Starbuck), Morgan Paull (""Blade Runner"") - Note: Connie Sellecca does not appear in the pilot.
2) MY BROTHER'S KEEPER (03/12/80) - Guest Stars: Jeff Cooper, Christopher Connelly (""The Martian Chronicles""), Denny Miller (""Wagon Train""), Jack Carter, Bobby Van.
3) SOUND OF TERROR (03/19/80) - Guest Stars: Ronee Blakley (""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), Rene Auberjonois (""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine""), Dirk Blocker (""Black Sheep Squadron"").
4) THE LION - Unaired by CBS - Guest Stars: Michael Cole (""The Mod Squad""), Christine Belford (""Outlaws""), Michael Pataki (""The Amazing Spider-Man"").

BEYOND WESTWORLD is a fun, sadly short-lived TV series with a premise that has some similarities to the famous Fembots seen in both THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and THE BIONIC WOMAN.  The series had potential but devastatingly low ratings led to an early cancellation, leaving 2 episodes unaired.  It's also interesting that Connie Sellecca would play a character - also named ""Pam"" - only one year later on THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO.  TRIVIA: Connie Sellecca and Jim McMullan co-starred in the 1979 TV movie ""She's Dressed to Kill"" - check it out on YouTube.com!  :-)

Thank you Warner Archive for releasing this all-but forgotten blast from the past on DVD!!!  Keep 'em coming!!!  Please release on DVD ""THE PHOENIX"", ""VENGEANCE UNLIMITED"", ""THE FANTASTIC JOURNEY"", ""THE FUGITIVE"" (2000-01), ""SOMETHING IS OUT THERE"" and ""PROJECT: UFO""!",1407456000,32,2322,5.460893854748603

6583477,1,B00MIYRZAE,"Don't buy this its sooooo bad.  Clich villain with two corny protagonists who foil bad guy's plans for world domination in the last second every time.  characters unlikeable.  plot is moronic.  execution is worse.

I took the liberty of writing the review in binary for the androids who are considering watching this.

6583482,5,B00MIYRZAE,Good fun 80's show. The series is a fine example of tv sci fi in the 80s and 90s. Connie Sellaca would go on to be the love interes to The Greatest American Hero. The rest of the cast went into the unknown. This is a DVR and is pricey for just 5 episodes.,1455667200,6,255,3.740740740740741
6583483,3,B00MIYRZAE,"Just  finished watching ""Beyond Westworld - The Complete Series"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Beyond Westworld"" was a short lived series which first aired in 1980.  Although five episodes were produced, only three actually made it on the air.
Attempting to build upon the mythos established in ""Westworld"" and ""Futureworld,"" ""Beyond Westworld"" centered among the activities of former Delos chief scientist Simon Quaid who was now bent on world domination and controlling humanity by putting robots in control.
So the basic plot of each of the five episodes revolved around some scheme of Quaid's to advance his agenda and Delos Security Chief Jon Moore arriving on the scene with special agent Pam Williams arriving on the scene to figure out what was going on and stop Quaid.
Interestingly enough, in the pilot episode, ""Westworld Destroyed,"" the character of Laura Garvey is introduced and she is assigned to work with Moore.  There are hints, or red herrings, that Garvey is a robot, who independent of Delos and Quaid, is self-aware and has her own agenda, which includes stopping Quaid.  Gravey politely declines all offers of food and drink, and she is not injured in an attempt to kill her and Moore.
Gravey sadly only appeared in the first episode before the character of Pam Williams came aboard.
I suspect that Gravey came to close to Isaac Asimov's robots and that's why she was replaced.  Hollywood hates copyright infringement lawsuits - just ask Harlan Ellison.
The five episodes in this series are:  ""Westworld Destroyed,"" ""My Brother's Keeper,"" ""Sound of Terror,"" ""The Lion,"" and ""Takeover.""  Only ""Westworld Destroyed"" with its hint of a robot with her own agenda is a truly stand out episode in this series.
Fans of the original ""Westworld"" and ""Futureworld"" movies will be disappointed with this series.  Yet, it does offer some interesting cameos - George Takei [Sulu] as a robot neurosurgeon who implants a mind control device in a police commissioner; and Russell Johnson [The Professor] as one of Quaid's robot henchmen for two episodes.
Not a great television series.
Recommended only for die-hard fans of the Westworld-verse.
Two Stars.",1455494400,9,2162,5.139601139601139

6583485,2,B00MIYRZAE,"I saw the first of these and could not watch any more. While the special effects ere cheesy and the clothing and styling was, well, dated, that was to be expected and could have been forgiven if it told a good story. This show did not. There were plot holes that I could have driven a truck through. Come on guys, a 15-year old could have pointed out lots of ways to improve this one.

The only reason I got two stars is because it followed up on the rather fun ""Westworld"" --- there was some fun follow up on that movie.",1449964800,,521,4.107843137254902

8672707,5,B00MIYRZAE,I loved this 30 yrs ago and the who show is here. My only regret is I thought it lasted longer than it did. Its good for what it is but you can watch the whole thing in a day.,1511049600,,175,3.4
8672708,3,B00MIYRZAE,"The original Westworld was creative for its time, and as such holds up as decent classic cinema. It's sequel Futureworld took a stupid premise and made it interesting by investing the audience in its characters and James Bond feel.
Which leaves Beyond Westworld. A Westworld property by way of name-drops only, Beyond Westworld is a show about a special unit looking for androids trying to take over the world for a disgruntled ex-employee supee-genius villain. What's worse is it's not very good at all. The production values alone are bad enough and the episodic feel of the only five (5!) ~48 minute episodes squanders any potential the show might have had.
And worse, it retcons the events of the original movie from being a case of machines gaining sentience and turning on man, to being a simple case of sabotage.
The DVD release is from a different master than the single episode that appeared on the Blu-ray of the movie, showing slightly smaller black bars on the sides of the image. The audio is 2.0 mono and, unlike the Blu-ray there's no subtitles or Closed Caption options. Stick with the pro gallery movie or the new TV reboot.

WOW, does not resemble West World in the slightest.  Terrible show that is amazing it ever was even made.  The first episode references West World and from then on its a bizarre sci fi, with no ""West"" at all.  I couldn't finish.  The dvd played well and it was a good product.  Should a rented it!!!",1496102400,,450,4.0
