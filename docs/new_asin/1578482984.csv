196613,5,1578482984,"I'm not usually one to watch a ""love story"" movie, but I was really touched by this one. I thought the kids in the movie did a excellent job of acting, and held their own with seasoned actors Ralph Macchio, Rachel Ticotin, and Diane Ladd. The ending of the movie was sad, happy, and emotional all rolled into one. Old and young alike should enjoy watching this movie. I also loved the theme song which was played through out the movie and during the credits at the end. Wish I could find it on a CD somewhere along with the words, if there are any.",1185408000,2,548,4.228571428571429
196614,5,1578482984,"Why haven't we heard more about this movie?  I wanted it to go on forever.  It's touching, heartwarming, a fantastic story, and a great twist at the end!  Ralph Macchio is brilliant and  Diane Ladd is great as the grandmother.  If you ever want to just sit back for a couple of hours and take refuge from the outside world and just feel good, then watching this film would be the way to do it. If you want to feel emotion like never before, then this is the movie to watch.  I'm still crying, not from sadness...but the tender tears of joy that this film induced.  This is a movie for all ages.",1111795200,12,594,4.20353982300885

196616,5,1578482984,This was really a heartwarming story about a boys first crush. The kids in this film are so cute. This is a video you could watch with the whole family. Ralph Macchio was perfect as the ghost who helps the boy win the heart of the girl he likes.,971568000,2,245,4.020408163265306

7799255,5,1578482984,"It is one of those films which may be viewed from several different vantage points and nonetheless be much appreciated from wherever one might be standing.  Wonderful performances of those not so much acting parts, but becoming the characters in the story.  Ralph Macchio and Diane Ladd have found the key to our hearts in this masterpiece that has flown, as often is the case, totally under, or more aptly, over the cinematic radar.  Do watch this film quietly, by yourself, or with some person or others you love, and deepen your perspective of what Love is, or better said, should be.  And if you manage to view this entire film without shedding one tear, then you have much more reserve and self-control than I.  Well done and bravo!",1395446400,,737,4.682170542635659

7799257,5,1578482984,"Ralph Macchio was truly unforgettable in this movie.  I always enjoyed him in the ""Karate Kid"" movies and ""My Cousin Vinny"", but ""Forever Together"" truly showed Mr. Macchio as a versatile actor.  Diane Ladd was funny and touching...10 stars as far as I'm concerned.",1228521600,,265,5.0
7799258,2,1578482984,"My family and I really liked this movie,for the simple fact that there was no profanity in it. However, there was one part in the movie in the older couple's romance where the young stud was dancing with an old lady that creeped us out a little. Plus the little boy and girls relationship was a little far-fetched but,  other than these two flaws it was a cute movie and was well worth the price.",1222128000,,396,4.28

7799261,5,1578482984,"I recently purched this movie used, and until I did so, I had never heard of. ""Forever Together"" or ""Can't Be Heaven"", whichever you choose to call the film, is about young Danny who finds himself having feelings for his best friend, Julie, altbough he can't find a way to express himself.

The film warmed my heart. A young Michelle Tratchtenberg plays the secondary main character beautifully, and  watch her understanding of Danny slowly unfold, is simply charming. The characters so kind hearted, that I think this is a film that can be watched over and over again.

(I tend to have trouble spelling Michelle's last name.)",1187222400,4,626,4.831775700934579
