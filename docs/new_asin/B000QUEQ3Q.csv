2842878,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"My jiu-jitsu/kickboxing instructor insisted we watch 1-10.  ""This is why jiu-jitsu is so important.""  You will see when fighters with certain disciplines go to the ground, they loose.  You'll see boxers fight jiu-jitsu, ninjitsu fight wrestlers, etc.  Very educational for you new MMA junkies and guys who are just learning how to fight.  Might want to reconsider starting your formal Karate lessons after watching these.",1193961600,3,421,5.415384615384616

However, the learning points and how the Gracies captured America are all there. I purchased them for a class and had it expedited. It arrived three days late. It was not amazon's fault but one of the UPS driver's incompetence. UPS did re-emburse some of the cost, but I would not recommend you purchase this item at an expedited rate.",1391040000,,434,4.723684210526316
2842967,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"This timeless classic beats any of today's silly ""no holds barred"" action shows.  Royce Gracie and company = the real deal.

100% Recommendation for any true MMA fan. This is how UFC got started, to prove to the world that BJJ is the top martial art in the world.",1379203200,,268,4.38
2843030,5,B000QUEQ3Q,Perfectly new DvD's of the good ol' days of minimal rules UFC. Before it was MMA and people showed up with their own style and generally bad cardio. The shipping was insanely quick too.,1362096000,,185,4.470588235294118
2843031,4,B000QUEQ3Q,Started by Rorion Gracie the UFC was put together to showcase Gracie Jiu-jitsu and its effectiveness against other styles. Brings back memories... good action but the commentary was almost comical.,1352332800,,197,5.6
2843032,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"If you are a big fan of the UFC this is a must have. It is the first 4 events. In this collection you will see legends such as Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, Kimo, and Dan Severn. There is some very exciting fights in this collection and it is a must have.",1341446400,,253,3.8846153846153846
2843033,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"Longtime UFC fans have no excuse for not buying this set. You get UFC 1-4 in this box set with all the televised matches as well as some retrospective interviews adding insight to the managerial side of the early UFC and some of the fighters. These early UFC matches also feature some of the most legendary fighters such as Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, and Dan Severn.

However, this collection isn't for everyone, hence the 4 star rating. Those of you who only discovered the UFC in the 2000s or later will barely recognize these events as the sport they love. A majority of the matches were highly chaotic and unbalanced. While watching Royce Gracie and Keith Hackney fight each other will likely be entertaining to a modern UFC fan, they would probably find it boring to see Gracie fight Ron Van Cleef in a disapointing one sided match.

The brutality of early UFC may also turn some modern fans off. As brutal as recent UFC fight may seem, they are rather tame and controlled compared to the nearly anything goes mentality of these early UFC events. Kicking grounded opponents, rabbit punches, punches to the groin, and knees to the head were all legal and frequently done.

Also note that these early UFC fighters did not train in what is considered to be the MMA fighting style common over the past few years. This meant that few fighters had a strong ground game and often flopped around on the ground when taken off of their feet.

If you are an old time fan of UFC, then stop reading and buy this set. If you are a newer fan, then it is probably worth checking out anyway, but don't expect the mixed martial arts you're familiar with.",1329350400,6,1642,4.555932203389831
2843034,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"The beginning of what is now known as ""MMA."" Awesome no holds-barred fights-""before there were rules."" This is a must have for anyone into MMA. Great fights that show why you must incorporate grappling into your MMA arsenal in order to be successful. Royce Gracie was incredible-taking down much larger and stronger men utilizing ""Gracie Jijitsu."" A great set of DVD's. Very high quality resolution. I recommend this DVD set.",1318636800,,425,5.085714285714285

2843087,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"This is where it all began. If you want to learn the history of some of the UFC legends, this is good source. It is a bit more brutal than UFC now but it will give you a greater appreciation of what made the legends of UFC who they are.",1252713600,,236,3.74
2843088,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"Nice collection for a reasonable price.
Watching again, I now know what made that old myth about ""95% of fights going to the ground"" so popular. It was repeated a number of times by the commentators!
That should be ""95% of arrests"" not fights.",1245974400,,243,4.545454545454546
2843089,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"Ah, the early days of the UFC.  Rorion Gracie wanted to live the American dream so the Gracie's used their connections to get the UFC started to promote the Gracie's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Were certain people chosen over others for entry?  Was Royce protected?  Many arguments can be laid out but lets ignore those.

This is the sport in it's early days (as far as the United States scene is concerned) where traditional martial arts were still the way.  Fighters practicing one discipline and trying to prove it's worth.  Eventually more and more rules would be enforced and the Gracie's would leave thinking the rules were too much.

Simply put, if you appreciate MMA and it's history, you can do no wrong picking these up.  If you enjoy a spectacle you will also enjoy these.  Otherwise you might just want to rent.",1237248000,3,817,4.690140845070423
2843090,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"I only got into MMA a few years ago so I bought this to see what it was all about back in the 90s.  The commentary is cheesey, the color commentators constantly got info wrong and wtf... Jim Brown? come on what was Gracie and partners thinking.  Just watching the Tuli/Gordeau fight gives you an idea of what it was all about when it started.",1231718400,2,342,4.246153846153846
2843091,4,B000QUEQ3Q,the old UFC was quite a bit different than the current UFC.  I think these matches are much more interesting to watch.,1219968000,4,118,4.363636363636363
2843092,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"The BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of realistic fighting, diversity and excitment. It shows fighters from many disciplines such as jiu-jitsu, wrestling, karate, tae-kwondo, kick boxing, sumo, etc. The fighters are the cream of their groups.

The fighting scenes look realistic, exciting and scaring too when somebody got seriously hurt.

This showed that in real life, fighter with good submission skills usually win in a non-armed fighting. This DVD is a must-have for action fans.

I bought it from Walmart for only 26 dollars. I can't go wrong with that.",1216339200,,562,5.021505376344086
2843093,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"I still remember when I first purchased UFC 3 on VHS in the 90's. It was so fresh, underground, and controversial. There were allot fewer rules and no weight classes, and the fighters were masters of their own disciplines. I liked seeing a master of jiu jitsu face off against a master of kickboxing. Today nobody really has a single discipline (they are all mixed martial artist). That is really the huge difference that you will see. The old tournaments featured men, who had dedicated their life to their craft and were true masters of their discipline. Case in point, Royce Gracie is better at Jiu Jitsu than any current MMA fighter, but he also isn't as well rounded as todays fighters, who are well versed in multiple fighting styles.

I also liked how these original tournaments addressed age old questions, such as which fighting discipline is the best, or can a David really beat a Goliath? I also like the classic way the tournament was run. 8 fighters began and winning fighters would advance to the next round to face each other until only one man was left standing as champion.

Yes, I agree that today's fighters are probably better than the ones you will see in these old tournaments, but these guys laid the ground work.",1210204800,22,1236,4.665137614678899
2843094,5,B000QUEQ3Q,Any fan of the UFC will want this product to see just how it was back in the day when the UFC was on its way to making the word Octagon a normally-used word. This is history and is essential viewing to appreciate today's UFC and the excellent duo of Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan - not to mention Big John McCarthy.,1206489600,,313,4.064516129032258
2843095,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"By todays standard, these guys will all seem pretty primative. But, back in the day, everyone thought that karate chop man would take down the world. So now we have a better understanding of fighting and it is much more evolved, thanks to the Gracie family who started the UFC to share their fighting style with the world. Buy this, enjoy it, and in turn, you will appreciate the skill of the fighters today.",1203033600,5,408,4.527027027027027

Its great to get this because you get to see how the sport evovles over time, for the better or for the worse, it is up to you to decide. I would recommend going to ebay to buy UFC 1-30, that is what I did becasue UFC only released 1-8 of the UFC classics series.",1201478400,11,419,3.772727272727273

8197663,5,B000QUEQ3Q,"This is the set that real original UFC fans have been looking for. These are the bouts where the fighters were randomly matched, and the winners fought the winners of the other matches. Fighters fought 2 to 3 times each during the event, with little time in between each fight to recuperate. The very first UFC event is here complete, some of the other events start after the preliminary bouts, which I don't think aired originally. The quality of these dvd's isn't the greatest, as I believe they were originally taped cheaply, with no idea of how big the UFC was to become. This a great set to watch with friends, especially before a modern UFC event night.",1474070400,2,659,4.593220338983051
8197664,4,B000QUEQ3Q,"It was fine. The filming on 1 thru 3 was average. 4 was much better. If you're a UFC fan, you'll like it. (At least an older UFC fan will.)",1461456000,,139,3.6666666666666665

8197666,3,B000QUEQ3Q,"To no real fault of its own, I was kind of disappointed with this.  When I first watched this many years ago, it was so groundbreaking. The knockouts and bloodshed were unlike anything we had ever seen. To watch them now, as a student of the art, it's almost painful. Most technique goes right out of the window after the first punch lands. The majority of the fights end within a minute or two. Even royce looks unimpressive compared to the bjj you can see today (blasphemy, I know).  But it is kinda cool to reminisce about how the sport got started and who doesnt want to see a 600 lb sumo wrestler catch a roundhouse to the face?",1456099200,2,633,4.310924369747899
