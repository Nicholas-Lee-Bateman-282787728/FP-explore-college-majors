1825639,3,B000083C4O,"I'd like to start by saying that Lady Ninja, also known as Kunoichi, was a decent film for it's genre.
This film is actually based on a series of Ninja stories from Japan and is way down on the list in the order.  However it is it's own film and can be viewed as an individual story.  The story centers around 7 Kunoichi (female ninja in Japanese) who under the supervision of Jyubei Yagyuu (a samurai)try to get revenge for their slain buddist nun sisters.  The nuns are ruthlessly killed by a Japanese Lord who enjoys the company of women a little too much.  In fact he has a habbit of kiddnapping brides on their wedding nights and keeping them for his own little private harem.
Throughout the film the 7 ninja battle against the Lords Henchmen.  Some of whom have magical capabilities. (such as pulling eyes out which become one eyed assasins and another who can poison you by touching you)  The Kunoichi also have some tricks up their sleves which the girls learn to unlock during the film.  There are several confrontations throughout the film where the ninjas kill the henchmen one by one.  Also, some of the girls don't make it to the end.  I won't say anymore, so as not to spoil it for you.
The lead ninja is played by Yuko Moriyama.  She is the one who really shines in this film with her strong screen presence and solid performace.  The film does offer some B movie special effects which come across well in the film, and a cartoonish ammount of gore.  I will point out however, that this is in NO way a child's film.  The situations and violence would not be appropriate for kids.  Also, a couple of the ninja women use strange attacks (one with her breasts and another with her hind end) The action is fast and uses a lot of wire work.  Not many grounded swordplay or martial arts sequences though.  The film has a very fantstical aire about it, more like Jet Li's Legend of the Swordsmen or Swordsmen II.
The release company on this film is Tokyo Shock, and they offer both the original Japanese language track, and an English dubbed track. (which is pretty much garbage)  Tokyo Shock has a ways to go in their dubbing department.  Other features include some interviews with cast and crew in Japanese (subtitled in English) and the film trailer.
This film may not be in everyone's taste, so if you're a Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fan, this may be a littel over the top for you.  However, it does have some nice cinematography, some nice surprises in the special effects department, and lots of cute ninja girls running around so it got a 3 in my book.
This is definately a rent it before you buy it film.  I did buy it before renting, and plan to watch it occasionally, but it's not going to be frequently played in my DVD player.  It's not that kind of film.",1068768000,8,2779,4.441814595660749
1825640,4,B000083C4O,"My wife and I put this on last night and let me tell you...It rocks!  Fast paced action and lots of samurai blood and guts abound in this Tokyo effort from Hitoshi Ozawa from Takashi Miike's ""Dead or Alive.""  My best recommendation of this movie would be to fans of recent Samurai picks, Miike, Troma and...Well, I think you get the idea.",1054166400,4,338,4.435483870967742
7978765,4,B000083C4O,"War lord bad. Hori women in convent good. Battle includes demons, flying ninjas. concubines in an anachronistic setting with guns and plastic goggles. The Ninja women develop special ninja powers when they are faced with a crisis. My favorite was the ""nipple shock wave"" a technique I haven't seen since ""Flesh Gordon"" and the power pasties. The odd power was ""the echo"" which allowed a Ninja to absorb a thrown energy ball into her crotch and then regurgitate it out the mouth. My understanding is the Tijuana Ninjas simply shoot it back out the same orifice, can catch as many as three and shoot them out in the same order they caught them.  I wonder if there is a patch so Tifa can perform the ""Nipple shock wave.""

The written subtitles did not in any way match the spoken English slang. This is a campy film reminding me at times of a spaghetti western. Clearly not for everyone.

Guide: No f-words. No sex. Young Japanese women nudity.",1461542400,,941,4.622754491017964

7978767,3,B000083C4O,"Well...
it's low budget but looks like a real movie not some amature cam movie.
the women are hot, very nude, silly anime like powers

ninja powers from their ... mmm ... feminin parts and so on

a lot of blood and nudity and fun.
it's a fun movie to watch and very entertaining",1348099200,,278,4.12962962962963
7978768,2,B000083C4O,"I must admit, I got this dvd knowing what to expect.  It is wonderfully bad.  I saw a preview as part of another dvd I own.  As soon as I saw it, I thought 'this is going to be horrible, but I have to have it.'  The preview showed the cartoony movements and effects, and over the top, for no apparent reason, costumes.  With all this, and the colors used, I kept thinking 'live action anime.'  The movie revealed even more nonsense.  And it was just what I expected.

The previews with the DVD have the producer proclaiming 'this is the B movie of all B movies.'  I think he hit his target.  This movie isn't cleverly written enough to make it to cult status, so just take it as the indulgence it is.  Think 'what if Evil Dead was done as women ninjas, with a similar budget, but not as good a script' and you have Kunoichi.

Get if you want something different, and like cheese (bad, smelly cheese).  Don't even fathom paying top dollar though.  Go to a marketplace vendor and pay for it used.",1194566400,3,994,4.245989304812834
7978769,1,B000083C4O,"""Lady Ninja,"" is one of those films where you're almost too embarrassed to admit that you watched, let alone purchased. However, to spare the rest of you such a horrible mess of a film; I am ready to fess up to this one. I bought this film at a great bargain price a few years ago. Yet, before I bought it, I remembered looking at the back of the DVD cover and thinking that this was not going to be a good film. But, I bought it anyway. I should have heeded my own inner advice. If there are any of you out there who like ninja/samurai films--stay away from this one. However, there are some lessons to be learned from this film. First, if you should see this film in your video store, pass if by quickly---lest you unintentionally rent it. Second, if you notice this film in the bargain 'For Sale' bin---pass the bin quickly lest you think you're getting a great bargain. And finally, should you be given this film in the mail by the studios to give a review on it---promptly take it out of its case, and using a steel wire brush, scrape vigorously with all your might. This way any temptation to play the film be will gone forever.

Yes, it's that bad a film. This mess of a film stars Yukio Moriyama, and director Hitoshi Ozawa. The film itself is based on the novel by Futaro Yamada [wonder how he felt?] The films narrative takes place in feudal Japan, where there is an evil lord by the name of Akinaru Katou (Ryuushi Mizukami). As the leader of the Aizu prefecture, where the setting of the film takes place, he has an insatiable appetite for pretty young girls. Anyway, to make a long story of a terrible film short; a massacre occurred which left seven daughters of the Hori clan as survivors, and as a result, these daughters were left behind in Edo. The daughters want to avenge the deaths of those in their clan, by destroying Akinaru Katou and his minions. These 7 daughters have a power so incredibly silly it defies description. The film introduces the viewer to the [incredibly bad] sword master Jubei Yagyu (Hitoshi Ozawa) His scenes are not only incredibly lame, but his acting was atrocious. This film ranks right up there with some of the worst ninja/samurai films I have ever seen. [And I have seen plenty]

Moreover, the story gets sillier, as the daughters of the Hori clan discover that they have INCREDIBLE powers. However, these powers are laughable at most. Plus, I am not sure whether amazon would allow descriptions of some of their powers, as they would probably be deleted with the usual [ellipses], therefore I will not go into them. Let's just say that this power emanates from the female anatomy. Suffice it to say that the acting is horrible beyond description. Further, the special effects are just plain bad. How BAD you ask? Well, for starters, we see chopped off heads and arms of the bad guys which looked incredibly fake. And when these limbs are chopped off it looks so silly, you either want to laugh, or stop the film [The latter would be preferable] You might know the type I am writing about, where a limb is severed and you see blood shooting out like a fire hose for about 45 seconds to a minute. The late Director Ed Wood may have made some bad movies in his time, but with the budget and costumes they had in this film, there was no excuse for it in this particular flick. This is just a bad film all the way around. Therefore, I do not recommend this film. Having viewed it twice now, I know I will NEVER have to see it again.",1192492800,,3478,4.4243369734789395
7978770,4,B000083C4O,"The plot IS  strange,but the action and cute chics make up for it. I think  this movie is a middle tier in terms of building a martial art movie collections. You should eventually watch it,rent or perhaps a cheap copy for sale. Not a bad movie,not a good movie but it is entertaining. Definitely Japanese! Dont let the bad reviews ruin this one...it is a fun to wacth(costumes:A+) fantasy filled movie that has some actualities concerning ninjitsu philosophy. The problem with most people reviewing ninja movies is most ninja movies are going to suck! Movie makers seldom bring dignity and respect to the ninja-spy character/plot as they do for the samurai-warrior. You won't feel bad for wacthing it and you shouldnt hate yourself for buying it,but don't pay over 10 dollars for it!",1173139200,,783,4.879699248120301
7978771,5,B000083C4O,"Just when we thought Gogo Yubari from ""Kill Bill"" was the hottest Japanese star ever!  But you ain't seen nothin' yet.  When you watch ""Lady Ninja,"" you will see why.  You will see why the girls in this movie are hotter!  Believe me.  There are other Japanese stars out there that are just as hot as Gogo.  The ""Lady Ninja"" DVD is a perfect example!",1140998400,,349,4.292307692307692
7978772,1,B000083C4O,"I tried to explain the premise to this movie (revengeful nuns train to be ninjas at Hogwarts School of Karate), and all of my friends thought I was practicing pitching ridiculous movies to soften up execs for the real movie ideas.  I was struck by the absurdity, the juxtaposition of near contstant female bare chests with male blood squirts.  If you were auditioning for this film, they would ask you to show your boobies (if you were a girl) or show your most graphic death face (for dudes).  What I don't get is why add so much naked girls?  They were so abundant that the women who didn't undress looked out of place! The political intrigue and ninja fighting would have been enough to carry this film, without the bouncy bits.

And the magical powers they all got!  Hoo boy, what a mess!  I will note that the less attractive girls had to do the stupidest ninja naked magic, like they were willing to do anything for a bigger role, unlike the really pretty girls who might show a little chest, but that's all.

Worse, the movie was made in 2000!!  Do you know how hard it was to make such a crappy ninja movie in 2000?!  It was nearly impossible, but this one combines ludicrous plot lines (the shogunate will fall if the evil twin of a master Buddhist priest dies, who are in symbiosis with each other), useless nudity (the evil lord captures youg brides to turn them into sex slaves...in his dungeon...what, no clean rooms in the house?!), inexplicable magical ninja powers (peep the girl who absorbs power bolts into her funny parts and then barfs them back at the enemy)and some of the worst over-acting ever filmed in ANY language (the evil lord literally screams his way throught the movie:  he must have been paid based on the decibel level)!  Hats off to the director and his favorite whiskey, 'cause nobody wrote this thing sober!

The only reason to watch this movie is to be able to lie to your friends about how great it is, and get them to buy it:  no reason for us to be the only knuckleheads who watched this drivel.  I can only hope that there will be a sequel!!",1116460800,6,2083,4.45910290237467
7978773,2,B000083C4O,"Ok, where should I begin?

This isn't meant to be a CTHD, Hero, or HoFD.  It's an inexpensive and guilty pleasure.  That's about it.  Everything about this film is over the top.  And I suspect it's meant to be.

The initial plot was actually pretty good.  Buddhist nuns seeking revenge.  OK, I can deal.  They become ninjas.  Cool.

The problem is that this was a bad combo of anime and live-action.  The shout out their attacks like in Sailor Moon.  And said attacks needed some better work.  As it is, it looks like a 20 year old geek came up with them:

Ninja Magic Red Phoenix: she learns it while making love

Ninja Magic Nipple Shockwave: Lightning comes from her nipples (the CGI even looks like Sailor Mars' ""Burning Mandala""!!!)

Ninja Magic Hair Storm: was better in ""Bride with White Hair""

Ninja Magic Returning Echo: Absorbs energy between her legs and spits it back out.

Ninja Magic Hatching Corpse: two die, and get their final energy attack.

The final attack is one absorbs all the ""ninja essences"" of her comrades and creates a sword.  Wow.

This was bad hentai.  I gave it two stars for the potential.  But the effects were horrid, the action was cartoonish at best (and bad cartoons at that!), and overall I'm glad I didn't pay to see this...  I will say that the bloodshed and spurts certainly inspired Tarantino's ""Kill Bill""  Now I know why I prefer Chinese cinema over Japanese cinema...",1111363200,7,1412,4.615384615384615
7978774,3,B000083C4O,"First off this is definitely not for every one.  The special effects are done in the old school forms.  While it's not the special effects we are normally subjected too, it is a good film.  This movie brings to mind the original Godzilla movies, for while they weren't the greatest out there, they are classics",1107561600,2,310,4.6
