168892,5,0800198840,"I don't know who reviewed this movie for Amazon, but they obviously have not been in love in a very long time. This movie is an ultimate favourite of mine. The characters are very believable, especially for people in love,  and Michael Landes role as a gay man trying to tell his father that he is  gay is not cliched, it is life!
Dream for an Insomniac is one of my  favourite movies because of its believable characters and situations that  can be easily related to life. I love the way they put quotations into the  movie and have the movie set in a coffee house, because i think that would  be my ideal life - surrounded by friends and having good  conversations.
If you are looking for a good romantic movie to see on a  date, see Dream for an Insomniac!",926899200,,759,4.295774647887324

168894,5,0800198840,"If I had to pick a movie that best described my life story, I would have to say Dream for an Insomniac.  It was a witty, thoughtful, intense, and captivating movie about dreams.  We all have them and some of us settle for  less than we had imagined.  Skye and Astin have defineate chemistry in this  movie and they allow the audience to believe in fate, destiny, and the  pursuit of happiness.  I have already seen this movie three times and will  defineately see it again.  I honestly don't do that either!!!",920505600,,509,4.445652173913044
168895,5,0800198840,"I really liked this movie despite some negative reviews I read recenty about it. Yes, MAYBE the characters were not fully develloped, and MAYBE the actors were not used to their optimum...But you have to love the way in  which this movie takes you to a far away, and Yet existing land of  dreams. The actors transmitted the message of the movie in such an amazing  simple and direct way. Ione skye was (in my opinion) superb and her  character (plus her great looks) was very attractive. Even though Aniston's  part was not a big one, but it sure was her best so far (excluding the  series friends of course).It's a movie about dreams and hopes. It's a movie  about love and friendship. And most importantly, its great to finally see a  movie where the actors make the actions instead of 3D computerised special  effects. Original and Great, Dream for an Insomniac is in my opinion A Must  See!!!",914544000,,896,4.578616352201258

Do these people watch the movies they review at all??  She is an aspiring actress, and as such, she is perhaps overly dramatic and prone to overly contrived speeches.  But, aren't all aspiring actresses (professional or merely by lifestyle) that way?  And don't our friends love us anyway?  Are we not entitled to love?

Mackenzie Austin (David) is likeable enough, and for a while displays some strength of character by sticking with his girlfriend, but of course by the end of the movie he falls for Frankie, though god knows why, as she does not show a single redeeming character trait in the whole movie. You could just picture them 5 years later, and her heading for the door because ""the passion is gone"".

168921,5,0800198840,"I've seen this movie countless times, and it keeps getting better every time I watch it. This is a very underrated romantic comedy. Intelligent as hell. Tons of chemistry between Mackenzie Astin and Ione Skye, the two main characters. Great supporting role by Michael Landes, who plays Ione Skye's cousin in the film. And Jennifer Aniston is great, too, as the ditzy best friend of Frankie (Ione Skye).

The first 15 minutes or so of this film are in black and white, and then it switches to color, very creatively I must say. The story is just fantastic. Any movie that quotes stuff always gets my attention... some of the references made in the film via quotes are Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Morrissey, Jim Morrison/The Doors, Kurt Cobain, and legendary philosophers like Aristotle and stuff. Brilliant screenwriting by Tiffanie Debartolo. I wish she'd make more films!

Ione Skye fans should also check out Gas Food Lodging.... yet another insanely underrated film.

I'll end this review by saying Dream For An Insomniac is a dream come true for a hopeless romantic (including me). It's released on DVD now (finally), and it's cheap.

If you have a heart, if you're remotely romantic in any way, buy this film. ""Chick flicks"" are not just for women. Straight guys dig 'em, too.",1016841600,5,1283,4.844748858447488
168922,5,0800198840,"""Dream for an Insomniac"" is an incredible movie that I truly didn't think I would enjoy.  When I first saw it, I thought it was going nowhere, but it turned out to be one of my favorite movies ever (second only to ""Gone With the Wind."")
I know a lot of people think this movie in unrealistic and fails where other Gen X movies succeeded.  My note to them is that this movie isn't a typical Hollywood romantic comedy, which is why it was done independently.  You have to acknowledge and respect Tiffani DeBartolo (writer and director) for her wonderful sense of language.  I realize some people do not talk like Frankie, David, Allison, Roberto, and Juice, but that is not the point.  Enjoy this movie for the lessons in life and love it has to offer.  There are so many lines from this movie that have become my mottos.
""Anything less than mad, passionate, extraordinary love is a waste of time.  There are too many mediocre things in life to deal with and love shouldn't be one of them.""
""I either get what I want or I change my mind.""
Please just give this movie a chance.  I know not everyone will like it, but don't knock it until you see it.",1006992000,16,1146,4.347417840375587
168923,1,0800198840,"I picked up this movie because it was on my local rental store's Picks shelf.  I had never heard of it before, and I had never read a review.
It was AWFUL.  I only watched it until the end because my friend and I were enjoying ourselves by cruelly insulting the main characters.
Frankie is entirely self-absorbed and pretentious.  The love interest is a boring wuss.  The friends are entertaining and are obviously more talented then the Couple, but they have to take a backseat to these idiots.  The acting (for the main couple) is weak and stiff.
Also, way too much quirkiness.  You know, the little habits and goofy details that writers stick in to make their characters seem cute and genuine.  Frankie quotes Nietzshe!  The gang dances to Sinatra in the coffeehouse!  They giggle over who's homosexual!
Of course, the whole idea that the leading lady's life is dull and colorless till she gets a boyfriend is idiotic.

Just another lame Generation X clone of Reality Bites.  Skip this one, and see a movie which stars people with an ounce of charisma or talent.",1006560000,2,1065,4.672043010752688
168924,3,0800198840,"This movie definitely caught me by surprise! At first glance, it seems to be another comedic no-brainer about twenty-somethings doing nothing all day in a coffee shop and complaining about it. Instead, the viewer is kept on her toes with the quickly delivered quotes from classic authors, rock legends, and familiar actors - all concerning love and its mysterious effects and twists. Mackenzie Astin is an immediately likable character and very boy-next-door. He seems an unlikely match for Ione Skye, who is an ironic mix of cynic, romantic, and dreamer. Her occasional original sayings and quips are not only food for thought, but executed perfectly. They are what makes the movie. Somewhat predictable, and most likely a ""chick-flick"", the movies is still not your typical romantic comedy. It gives the reader something to think about without getting bogged down in needless melodrama or caught up in competing with itself for witty one-liners. Something for the hopeful romantic (and insomniac!) in us all.",997574400,,1010,5.2407407407407405

Frankie and David's love of quotes was one of the things i just loved about the movie.  The whole principal of the movie I love as well though.  It is a love story, kind of traditional, but not really.  Love it Love it Love it.  Oh and a really specail bonus is that David reads Frankie some of Dr. Suess's sleep book to put her to sleep.

(  Pardon me, but Ione Skye, with a few more pounds, would look a lot like  Monica Lewinski.) The script and production is excellent and if you want a  ""sweet"" ending, you've got.

I would have given in 0 stars but the ratings  here only went as low as 1.",941760000,5,251,4.837209302325581
168943,5,0800198840,"What can I say about this movie other than I loved it.  The acting was natural.  Mackenzie Astin as Ione Skye's love interest reminded me of someone I used to be infatuated with, only in the movie I could vicariously  live through Frankie (Ione Skye) and get into his heart.  Skye's classic  beauty and grace was refreshing.  This movie absolutely took my breath  away.  Its the only film that makes me smile every time I watch it.",934416000,,431,4.5064935064935066

The acting of Skye is clunky is you let it bother you, but just pretend it's okay and the story goes okay too.",1433721600,,209,4.648648648648648
