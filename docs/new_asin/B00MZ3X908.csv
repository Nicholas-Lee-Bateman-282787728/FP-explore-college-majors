6604771,5,B00MZ3X908,"This was like 6 mini Queen's Blade movies.  The quality was that high.  I really enjoyed this series, and it helps add to the argument that Queen's Blade is one of the best ecchi action series of all time.  Loved it!",1420848000,,216,4.219512195121951

6604777,3,B00MZ3X908,no where near as good as the regular stories.  This 6 ep.  is what happens with everybody after queens blade ended before rebellion but alot of the story is boring more then anything.  They could have done a bit more then give everybody or team one episode of what happening.  They kind of do half of it is the maid's meeting up with goo girl and menace.  But the first 2 even the next 3 could have more action in them or something.  The last episode is ok.  Seems they could have done a move or something out of the middle 3 and been done with it with a little about the other 3.  That would have made it alot better.,1418342400,,618,4.049586776859504

6604780,5,B00MZ3X908,"The continuation of Queen's Blade and more fan service resumes in this OVA collection. This bridges the gap between the original Queen's Blade series and the newer QB Rebellion. It is not necessary to watch Rebellion before watching this anime, but it is highly recommended to watch the original series because the viewer would have no idea who the characters are, and what they are trying to accomplish. It is notable that this part of the series does look better than the two TV series. Since this is an OVA collection, it was not released for TV, but rather for DVD/Blu-Ray instead, which explains the higher quality for this show.

Each episode focuses on a specific group of characters, and some characters like Irma (assassin) and Risty (bandit) are completely absent. Airi (the maid) and Melona (bunny girl) are in half of the episodes, so if you are a fan of either girl, you will enjoy this collection. Characters like Cattelya (blacksmith,) Ymir (dwarf,) and Claudette (main character's elder sister) do not get very much time in this series at all. Fans of the series (you know who you are) will enjoy this series. There is no shortage of scenes of blatant fan service and nudity, just like the other two series. This really is not the best starting point for a new viewer to the series, but it looks better than the rest, and I feel that the action scenes are handled better. We also get to see a darker version of Naneal (the angel,) which Is kind of cool.

The original English dub for Queen's Blade is back again for better or worse. This 6 episode series is split into 3 episodes per DVD disc, and I believe that all 6 episodes are on 1 Blu-Ray disc. There are no special features to speak of besides trailers and textless closing credits.",1415318400,36,1755,4.603833865814696

6604784,5,B00MZ3X908,"I have no problem with beautifully animated women, in fact this video was every thing sexy, entertaining and suspenseful to watch. I believe this Queen's Blade series is only good, it is the same plot just differently made, so I must admit it was enjoyable. I may have to really consider buying them all.",1444867200,,304,4.648148148148148

6604786,4,B00MZ3X908,"I'm more than a little amazed this went so out-of-print so quickly, given that it's easily one of the best soft(-ish) core guilty pleasure shows of the decade.  Great character acting, nifty world building and an actual *story* -- and somehow they managed to show it on TV (though with some edits, which this Blu-Ray release thankfully lacks).  Here you'll get the first ""season"", with so-called ""Queen's Blade 2: The Evil Eye"" (which for some reason is far more readily available) to continue it.  Evidence strongly suggests they were originally meant to be one unified release, since the discs in this set are labeled ""Queen's Blade Collection 1-2"" and the ones in The Evil Eye are actually labeled ""Queen's Blade Collection 3-4"".

This might not be the next philosophical cornerstone title, but the original books are popular and acclaimed adult artists and animators brought their work to motion with flair and quite a bit of love in evidence.  Quite worth the watch.",1444176000,,971,4.969135802469136

6604789,1,B00MZ3X908,Not very much action and the storyline was boring.  I know this was after the tournament but I was hoping for new challengers for the central characters.  Queen's Blade Rebellion was much better.  Don't waste your time or money on this unless you want a little fan service with very few fighting scenes.,1439769600,,303,4.679245283018868

6604791,5,B00MZ3X908,"Finally some things are being explained. I wished Beautiful Warriors and the next OVA collection- which I forgot the name but it also fills in a lot of gaps, were in circulation before the Rebellion Series. Both this OVA set and the next one will answer a lot of questions I know I had when I watched the Rebellion series. But I still don't understand how Claudette became queen. Was it after Lana servered her 4 years or since she likes to wander, did Lana give up the thrown to Claudette since she felt she was better suited? SMH IDK.",1434412800,,536,4.37

The 1 disc Bluray version is a great complementary to the Queen's Blade TV series. I put this disc and one of the Seasons in a 3 disc case to save Room.

This OVA has lots of Fan service, in English and Japanese, sub in English.
If your collecting this series you might want to add this ova set to your collection.",1422489600,3,487,4.293478260869565
6604800,4,B00MZ3X908,"Queen's Blade Beautiful Warriors is the bridge between the original series and Rebellion. The best way to describe BW is a mid-quel, a sequel show that takes place between two other stories. The anime is 6 episodes featuring the ladies of the original series. Fans who were upset that Rebellion had so few of the original series characters will be glad to see their favorite lady warriors return.

Each episode is focused on different characters as none of these episodes are connected kind off. The only two characters that are featured prominently in more than one episode are the scythe-wielder maid with the disappearing clothes and the bunny girl with the jello-body. Still just about every major character has her own part of an individual episode, so your favorite warrior will be there in at least one episode.

As usual with QB, the question is: How much nudity is there? There is plenty for you ecchi-fans so you can breathe easy. Let's be honest: the only real reason QB became popular was because of the liberal use of nudity. If you are a QB fan, you have already bought this or have at least pondered buying this. IF you loved the original series, you will enjoy this. There is some foreshadowing for the sequel series: QB Rebellion, but none of those new warriors appear at all.

I loved the original series, but felt that Rebellion was a step backward, still BW was a good return to form for the series. It is only 6 episodes, so don't expect an entire series worth of content. For what it is though QB: Beautiful Warriors is more of what made the first series a big hit and there is nothing wrong with sticking with what works. The only real flaw besides its length is that watching the original series is required to enjoy this release. If you are a new fan looking to get into Queen's Blade, please start with the original series, as BW does nothing to help you catch up.

In the end, Queen's Blade: Beautiful Warriors is a good buy for fans of the classic series despite the lack of a central plot. The ladies are back and the ecchi content is plentiful. If you were unsure on this, rest assured that QB:BW is a show worth owing for any QB fan.

Pros: The original cast of ladies are back.
The show has plenty of humor, sexy situations, and all the typical QB fun.
It is fairly priced for a new anime release.

Cons: There is no real central plot.
New fans will be lost without seeing the original series.
The lack of any real disc Extras except trailers which is sad because the little OVA episodes from the original series were just fun to watch. Watch the trailer for So I cant play H, as it is awesome.

Overall:
QB:BW is worth at least a watch for fans of the series. There is nothing wrong with the series at all, and you getting a quality ecchi anime for a fair price.",1422230400,6,2795,4.447265625
8675396,5,B00MZ3X908,"Yeah it's Queen's Blade so buy it! Certainly better than Rebellion geez what were they thinking with that one...Stick with the original cast and you can't go wrong. Noah is so hot and deserves her own anime as does Echidna. Sadly Claudette & Shizuka (who is dead) aren't in this but the angel Nanael who i found utterly annoying in season 1 & 2 is actually given a pretty good story where she turns evil and destroys the swamp witches castle. Each of the girls gets their own little story in a self contained episode, it's not as sexually charged as season 1 and 2 but the fan service is of course still present and appreciated. There's so much spin off series they could do with Queen's Blade it's a shame they aren't exploring that. It looks like they are doing some sort of redux now with new character art for classic characters not sure if it's going to be ""new"" or just a season 1 & 2 redux but any Queen's Blade is good Queen's Blade so we'll see.",1526947200,,954,4.305555555555555
