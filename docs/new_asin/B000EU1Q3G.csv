8114365,5,B000EU1Q3G,"These shows take me back to when I was a kid.  The time when Television was
much more simple, clean, and fun.  I was a time when you could watch TV,and
not feel offended. To me George Reeves did a great job of acting. I loved
most all of the shows even though their are much alike in many ways. It's
an original series when Superman was what he was suppose to be not like some warped series they have today.",1238198400,,407,4.012345679012346

8114370,5,B000EU1Q3G,"This is a superb set.  The transfers are wonderful with great quality both picture and sound.  The commentaries, especially the ones by Noel Neill and Jack Larson are so enjoyable.  Hearing them remember different episodes and actors/characters is so much fun.  Their commentary seems so heartfelt and sincere.  Many of the episodes hold up even today, and others give us a glimpse back into life during the late 50's.  For anyone who grew up with George Reeves Superman, you won't want to miss this.",1153612800,10,500,4.892857142857143
