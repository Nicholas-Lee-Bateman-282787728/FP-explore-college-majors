The producer up-rezzed every single frame of the original 1972 videotape footage and has made it worthy of a big screen release.

8260119,5,B0015VIPUU,"This is a super rare document of the early 70s concert tours by Leon Russell that were released on the Leon Live album.  This video was impossible to find when it first was released, and continues to be hard to come by and quite valuable.  If you have a chance to get a copy, do so. It is possibly one of the best Leon Russell filmed performances and the only place to find film of this period in his career.  It is yet to be released on DVD.",1393977600,4,442,4.0
