2865033,1,B000REWYQ2,"Incredible.  DVD manufacturer has taken this Soviet documentary consisting of newsreel footage shot in 1946, in the only available film format of 1.35:1 ratio, and stretched it out to Cinemascope width and letterboxed it!!!  Evidently, they think this will work better on the new widescreen TVs than setting the set's picture option to 4:3.  It doesn't.  And none of the other screen options take it any better; they just enlarge it and make the misery greater.  For the picture on the DVD itself has been stretched, and stretched it will remain, or just be stretched moreso.  Everyone is short and fat; Goering is even fatter.  Plus there is some sort of a processing glitch that makes the picture jerk to a stop for a nanosecond every regular second, tho the soundtrack moves seamlessly along.  Soundtrack is also scratchy, FWIW.

Back it goes to Amazon in tomorrow's mail.  We'll try the other guy's ""on-demand DVD-r"" version and hope he's not using this one as his source; and will let you know.

PS - The film itself is concise and attention holding, the narrative reflecting the Soviet sentiment toward the Nazis and their take on the important points of the trial.  Too bad this distributor had to wreck it with the technological revisionism.",1277856000,19,1249,4.867298578199052

2865036,2,B000REWYQ2,"This movie's only a little over an hour long, but I swear it took a day to watch it. That's because the unnamed British narrator (who sounds like Kim Philby's twin) is so into his work as a Soviet propagandist, it's simply mind-boggling.

This Soviet 'documentary' (and I use that term VERY loosely) was made in the USSR and distributed to the US via a KGB movie outlet. Stalin's speechwriter apparently created the script, which is so ham-handed you feel like you're being slugged with a cast iron frying pan with every other breathless, exaggerated, fictional sentence.

Just about the only thing here that isn't padded with Soviet propaganda is the fact that Nazis were tried at Nuremberg.

If you know anything, and I mean anything, about the Soviet history - particularly Stalin's history - in WW2,  you'll be stopping this movie like I did. It's freaking unbelievable, the amount of utter BS! Nowhere does Kim Philby, errr, the narrator, mention that little Soviet-Nazi non-aggression pact. No mention of how Stalin, with his ally Adolf, marched into Poland and split it into pieces.

The most jaw dropping part is the breathless, naked hate against the Nazis, in almost every instance, could've been directed at Stalin himself. One example out of dozens: footage from Bylerussia, before the war. The narrator dramatically says, over pictures of pretty girls in Byelorussian dress and cornflower hair wreaths, ""Where are these girls now? [The Nazis] snatched them off the street. Families, children disappeared!"" Uh yeah, and so did any number of ethnic groups across the whole of the conquered Soviet territories during Stalin's various terror campaigns.. Somebody was filling up that enormous Siberian gulag - maybe the girl with the cornflower wreath?

This is worth two starts, simply for the blatant amount of Soviet BS and for some of the newsreel footage (you can skip over the parts where they hang on the various Nuremberg Nazis, with comments like, 'Look at that face! The fact of a murderer!' I kept waiting for the dastardly villain to jump out and twirl his black handlebar moustache, that's how antiquated and scenery-chewing this narration is.)

Make NO mistake: the Nazis were evil beyond compare. Until you remember that their first ally was the Soviet dictator who helped murder millions on his own dime.",1462665600,,2328,5.031168831168831

2865040,3,B000REWYQ2,"Interesting as a historical document, this USSR-produced, 1948 documentary is principally a bill of particulars against the Nazis. The Russians tended to be even more pissed off at the Germans than we were; after all, Germany never invaded North America, and it has been argued that, in eastern Europe at least, it was the Russians who really won the war. The degree of vituperative rhetoric is actually somewhat amusing. A very different perspective on the Nuremberg trials than you get on the History Channel.",1436400000,,511,5.095238095238095

2865060,4,B000REWYQ2,"""Leaders"" can not use the excuse of war to justify horrific crimes against other human beings. I think this documentary is good for everyone to see to try to understand how so many followed an insane leader with insane beliefs.  Do you think the accused ever realized the horrors they committed? I was not sure as I watched their faces as their sentences to death by hanging were announced. At least there were some good Germans who risked their lives to  attempt to assassinate Hitler. There were 20 attempts, even by his own soldiers, which unfortunately failed. Extremism is dangerous in any country.",1388275200,,603,4.844660194174757
2865061,2,B000REWYQ2,"One must realize that the Nuremberg Trials were the first time that those in power had been held accountable for 'crimes against humanity.'  The overly dramatic rhetoric might be excused because of the timeline. Note that the USSR seems to dominate the trial and perhaps recognize that the inhabitants as well as the military had suffered the most brutal acts. As with many of the documentaries, the original footage has been edited to include as much information as possible in a short time span. The information is reasonably accurate and again, this reflects the prevailing attitude during this time. For those who want a relative simplified overview or an introduction, this might be of interest. There is graphic footage that is intended to convey the atrocities committed (as ordered) by those in command of the Nazi regime.

A thought: What would have been the outcome of trials for atrocities committed by Stalin and the communist regime during the same timeline?

2865062,1,B000REWYQ2,"I don't claim to be a Nazi or anything like that, but I thought that the men who stood trial were not given a fair trial. A fair and just trial is one element that makes the USA stand apart from any other nation. Our constitution guarantees a trial by an unbiased jury. That did not take place in Nuremberg. The trial should have taken place in somewhere like Switzerland. It was a neutral territory. In my opinion these men did not get a fair or a just trial. What they faced rather than Justice was a biased lynch mob.",1386288000,,520,4.21
2865063,3,B000REWYQ2,"It is truly amazing how separate the ""USSR and the allies were."" It is worded like that through the documentary. I am really surprised this was in English. I would have still gave it a better rating if it did not seem so hurried. I think this film is from a very Russian point of view, which I respect, it just needs to be like 30 minutes longer to make it educational.",1379980800,,369,4.138888888888889
2865064,4,B000REWYQ2,I believe this film chronicle of the Nuremberg Trials must have been filmed and produced by the Soviet Union.  It is the Soviet's viewpoint of the atrocities of the Nazi war criminals.  A British narrator has been dubbed into the film.  Many documentary films on the Nuremberg Trials have been produced.  This one provides another perspective from the viewpoint of Russia which suffered inhumane atrocities from the Nazi army.  I recommend watching this chronicle if you have an interest understanding the historical significance of these war crime trials.,1377475200,,556,5.2727272727272725
2865065,3,B000REWYQ2,Although I liked how it was put in original filming. I found that it could of been a little more detailed :),1373328000,,108,3.9545454545454546
2865066,2,B000REWYQ2,"I know (and accept) this DVD was transferred from old reel films from the 1940's. I didn't expect the video quality to be clear, but I didn't think it would be this bad. There are pixelations and the picture appears to jump or shift, and not the usual jumpiness kind from old films, either. I don't know what it is, except that the transfer process must be of very poor quality.

So then I was hoping that the content would at least make the DVD worthwhile to watch. It wasn't. That the documentary has a Soviet slant is given, seeing how it came from old USSR archives. Charges against the Nazis were shown written in Russian. Soviet judges and prosecutors were given center stage. I suppose there's nothing wrong with that. But this is pure propaganda: Stalinesque in style and substance. The Nazis were caricatures of who they were, with not a single attempt to present only the facts. They were Nazis and enough should be gleaned from that. The snarling, overwrought narration makes the Nazis' evil deeds seem exaggerated (though those deeds certainly could not be exaggerated).

I don't recommend this DVD and I gave it two stars only because of its minor historical value. If you are a collector of old Soviet propaganda films, for example, then this DVD is for you. It is useless otherwise if you want to see the Nuremberg Trial for what it was. And that is, in the elegant words of Justice Jackson, the Allies ""flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law... .""

2865067,5,B000REWYQ2,"NUREMBERG TRIALS was produced in the USSR and released seven months after the first trial's conclusion. In the dock were the most prominent survivors of the Third Reich. Among them, former Reichsmarschall Hermann Gring, Deputy Fhrer Rudolf Hess, Wehrmacht Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, governor of Occupied Poland Hans Frank, Kriegsmarine leader Karl Dnitz, Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, highest surviving SS chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Head of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Wilhelm Keitel, former German chancellor Franz von Papen, Minister of Foreign Affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop, Minister of the Eastern Occupied Territories Alfred Rosenberg, race-baiting publisher of weekly newspaper 'Der Strmer' Julius Streicher and architect and friend of Der Fhrer, Albert Speer. We are given brief bios of all defendants.

As expected, this Soviet documentary often details events of the 1941 invasion of Russia. We see prisoners, stolen livestock, scenes of Leningrad in flames, the widespead destruction of that city, and captured German film of building detonations. Worst are death camp ovens, heaps of corpses, bags of hair, mountains of gold teeth and dentures, untold thousands of stolen rings and jewelry, soap made from bodies, tanned human skin, and skeleton-like survivors of the camps.

At film's opening, Josef Goebbels is shown soon after his suicide and at its conclusion, many of the just-hung defendants, several with agonized expressions on their bloodied faces as they lie on the floor with ropes still around their necks. These graphic moments appear in no other Nuremberg documentary that I'm familiar with.

Although generally good, some footage in NUREMBERG TRIALS looks very dark. An unnamed British narrator also provides translations of Russian, French and German participants. It's a must-see for all who are interested in WWII history. Highest recommendation.
