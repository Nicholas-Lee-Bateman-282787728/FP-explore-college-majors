The profanity doesn't offend me, but the 'bleeping' censorship does. Just about every word they say is 'bleeped' by the darn T.V. censors. But if this video is really uncensored, then I'll surely be buying it. The Osbournes is funny, crude, and moving at times. Ozzy might be old, but he's still cool. I don't care for his music too much, but The Osbournes are pretty cool.",1041379200,,499,4.434782608695652
7939222,5,B00005JLBV,"When I heard of The Osbournes I never really wanted to watch it but i saw a rerun of an episode a couple of days ago and now i'm head over heels with the show.  I've bought all kinds of merchandise of them now too. I'm also know a BIG fan of Ozzy and his music, i've bought almost all his CD's now and the DVD of his concert in Budokan.  I absolutely can't wait for the second season and the VHS/DVD of the first season!  My prayers are also with Sharon in fighting her cancer.  Sharon your awsome!!",1035331200,4,499,4.01010101010101
7939223,5,B00005JLBV,"Like everyone else, I was in hysterics when I first watched The Osbournes. When I saw the show advertised I honestly thought I would never watch it. However I was flicking through the music channels and came on to MTV just after the show started. From that moment on I was hooked and taped every episode !!! Now I'm a huge fan of the whole family and would LOVE to spend a week with them because they are fantastic! Let's hope they go ahead and bring them to VHS and DVD! .......... ROCK AND ROLL!",1032048000,5,497,4.242105263157895
7939224,5,B00005JLBV,"I absolutely love this show! Have watched the reruns over and over, never get tired of them. They just have to make a video tape with all of the first 10 episodes on it, uncensored, of course. The whole family just cracks me up, especially Ozzy. Would love to spend a week with them at their house. I don't think I would ever quit laughing.",1029369600,4,340,4.246153846153846
7939225,4,B00005JLBV,I would love to see more on this most intresting family.  Deep down there is a liitle bit of them in all of our own families.  It is just funnier seeing someone else going through life rather than our selfs.,1027123200,,207,4.15
