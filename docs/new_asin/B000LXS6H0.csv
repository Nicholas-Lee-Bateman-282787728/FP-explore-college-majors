2717578,5,B000LXS6H0,"I saw the first one a few years back.  I wasn't blown away by it, but thought it was a decent movie (a lot better than The Departed).  After all the buzz generated by The Departed, I had to revisit Infernal Affairs and its sequels.  Again, I thought Infernal Affairs is a good but not great movie after watching it the second time.  Infernal Affairs 2 is a better movie in my opinion since it develop the relationships that was missing in the first one.  Although the stars (Andy Lau and Tony Leung) weren't in it, Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang proves why they're two of the best actors in Hong Kong.  Finally, Infernal Affairs 3 is just a masterpiece.  Not so much a great movie on its own, but it binded and sealed the trilogy as my favorite trilogy of all-time perfectly with its use of flashbacks.  Check out all 3.  You won't be disappointed.",1170201600,15,845,4.365384615384615
2717656,5,B000LXS6H0,"One of the best cop movie I saw in my life!
Much better than the american version (the departed) and much profound story.",1365120000,,121,4.304347826086956
2717657,5,B000LXS6H0,"This is quite possibly one of my favorite crime drama's and in my opinion stands at a level far above the departed even though I loved that as well. This move stands as proof that a great trilogy (that not just reuses little gags from the movies before) that can add new twists and turns trough all three parts is possible to make. I think the only way to by this is in the box set because these three movies belong together. If you have seen the departed I definitely recommend you by this, not just for the film work, the music, and the perfectly casted Andy Lau, Tong Leung,  and Anthony Wong. But also because I really don't think you have the right to even say that you liked the departed, let alone say it was the best movie you have ever seen if you do not watch these first. Get over the fact that movies from other country's are subbed, these movies bring a set of flare and style to their genre that I have yet to see put into any movies from America, and I'm a screenwriter so I should know.",1228348800,2,1002,4.164948453608248
2717658,4,B000LXS6H0,"I love the series.  But the spoken languages are English and Cantonese, no Thai as it is advertised on Amazon!  Anyway, still great series.",1202947200,2,139,4.75
2717659,5,B000LXS6H0,"I am a huge fan of foreign movies and as of late been renting several Asian movies.  The Infernal Affairs Trilogy is my favorite!  Way before the hoopla of ""The Departed"", this movie has stood out amongst alot of Asian viewers as a 5 star! Andy Lau, star, director and writer leads a team of undercover and dirty cop characters twisting and turning in the police force.  Who is good and who is bad, that's what keeps you hanging in your seat till the very end.

Anyone who likes cop thrillers, and a cast of characters that keep you guessing should pick up this trilogy.  Highly entertaining!",1176163200,4,592,4.4953271028037385

2717661,5,B000LXS6H0,"""The Infernal Affairs"" is a very interesting movie. I like it better than ""The Departed."" Got the whole set within 2 days after purchase. Thanks Amazon for the great service!!",1175472000,5,175,4.866666666666666

2717663,4,B000LXS6H0,"Part 1 is a winner!  Martin Scorsese released the American version and won an Academy award.  What higher acclaim is there for this Hong Kong original movie?  The scipt takes the ""corrupt cop"" story to a whole other

level. Anthony Wong, Tony Leung and Andy Lau once again give outstanding performaces with a dramtic unexpected ending as only Hong Kong directors

seems to employ.

Part 2 is an interesting prequel. 2 young actors take the roles created by Andy Lau and Tony Leung and the movie weaves an interesting background

story.  Part 3 is sluggish, filmed simplty to establish a trilogy.",1174262400,7,595,4.821782178217822
2717664,5,B000LXS6H0,"China strikes again -- this time with Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs 1-3,"" an absolutely first-class piece of work that shows up Scorsese's rip-off, ""The Departed,"" as empty trash.",1174176000,5,179,5.428571428571429
2717665,5,B000LXS6H0,I always like watching the inspiration of something that has been Americanized and this is no exception. If your a fan of the movie The Departed make sure you pick up this 3 disc dvd set. They took alot from these movies and picked it up twisted it mixed it up and turned it into a crime drama set in Boston. This being set in China makes this one of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong. I highly recommend you watch these movies.,1174176000,3,435,4.069767441860465
2717666,4,B000LXS6H0,"Guess I wasn't supposed to sit thru all 3 all at once. But I was trying to

get a sense of continuance. And I got it. But I do feel a sense of

saturation. But one day I will watch them individually or maybe there will

be a chronological edition like The Godfather I, II & III. One thing I hope will never happen, The Departed II. Ahhhhhhh!",1173571200,,341,3.985294117647059
2717667,5,B000LXS6H0,"Finally, one of the greatest series in Hong Kong cinema has made it to our neck of the woods. I've been waiting awhile for an American distributor to pick this up and give it the proper treatment. Over a year ago I saw the series for sale in NYC (chinatown), and for some odd reason, passed it up. I thought I would have to make the trip back to East coast to get it, but thanks to Dragon Dynasty (and the fact that ""the Departed"" did so well), I've finally got it. It's sad that the ""Infernal Affairs"" series had to get the ""Hollywood"" treatment of a big-star remake just to get noticed, but oh well, better late than never, right?

This is an amazing series that showcases some of the best talent that Hong Kong cinema has to offer. Wiether it be from it's directors, Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, or it's amazing cast, that includes Andy Lau (Fulltime Killer), Tony Leung (Hard Boiled), Francis Ng (the Mission), Eric Tsang (Gen-X Cops), Leon Lai (Seven Swords) and Anthony Wong (Time and Tide), just to name a few. It's a definate must have for all us fans of Asain cinema. Or a for those of you not familiar to this side of the film world, it would definatly make a great introduction to it.

With the original, and it's superior prequel and mind-bending sequel, this trilogy will take you much deeper into the mythology of the characters and it's story, than the American remake even came close to. So, for all you fans of ""the Departed"", check this out and see how it all began (and truly ends).",1173312000,8,1497,4.381294964028777
2717668,5,B000LXS6H0,This set was incredible years ago when I watched it in the order it supposed to be watched.  It is sort of like Star Wars going backwards but it also makes lateral moves as well.  I am not sure how the order is on these DVDs but the original one jumped around a lot.  I bought the original DVDs in the order that they came out and had them imported from Hong Kong years ago and it is one of the best movies I have seen coming out of Hong Kong in a long time.  I do not want to compare the departed because it is sort of a joke to copy a movie then not acknowledge it.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good crime/suspense/thinker film.,1173312000,15,660,3.9696969696969697
2717669,5,B000LXS6H0,"My husband and I watched this movie on one of Direct TV channels.  The film was English Subbed and not Dubbed (as all films should be).  We enjoyed the film very much because there are a lot of surprises.  A year after we heard about Martin Scorsese's new film, The Departed.  As soon as we realized it was a remake of Infernal Affairs, we had to go watch it in the theater.  As much as I'm a huge fan of Martin Scorsese, I didn't like the alternate ending.  It was too Hollywood.  We enjoyed Infernal Affairs because the ending was very unexpected.  I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as we did.",1173312000,3,602,4.219298245614035
2717670,5,B000LXS6H0,"After you watching this ""The infernal affairs trilogy"", ""The departed"" will become a joke. And you will feel that Martin just wants to make some money by adapting this IA Series, the topest selling moive in Asia. And accidentally ""The departed"" got Oscar best picture. He even couldn't believe by himself! (It's true.)

The great thing about the IA is the screenplay and ""The departed"" totally adapts the idea. The directing of the ""The Departed"" is really nothing special!

The IA Series is not only a cop movie, it is also a movie about love and family. You have to see it! It is one of the greatest movie, like Godfather, you haven't seen in these years!",1172534400,7,657,4.6068376068376065
2717671,2,B000LXS6H0,"This is not so much a review of the movies(which are great) than the shipping.  I ordered this set on the 15th of Feb and it still has not shipped.  Estimated delivery says March 17th.  I usually ignore the estimate because Amazon has been good in the past at quickly delivery items, even if they set a long estimated delivery date.

Going over a week without shipping, when you show the item in stock is unacceptable.  Next time I will shop elsewhere for items I want to receive within a month.",1172188800,3,495,4.395604395604396
2717672,4,B000LXS6H0,"Great to see the ""Infernal Affairs"" series getting some attention in the States, but it's a big disappointment that the first (and best) film in this set is the same Miramax disc that came out a few years ago. Exactly. The DVD looks good enough, but a bit flat. No doubt the images could have been vastly improved: with all that metal and glass and the high-tech toys you'd think the visuals would sparkle. The other titles are welcome upgrades, however.

As for ""The Departed,"" just consider them different movies. I prefer ""Internal Affairs"" because of its originality and the surprise factor, but your mileage may vary.",1171843200,40,622,4.813084112149533
2717673,5,B000LXS6H0,"You are doing yourself a great disservice if you ignore the Infernal Affairs trilogy in lieu of The Departed, which valiantly attempts to combine the trilogy.  The IA movies masterfully weave together a great story about a triad boss and the cop(s) trying to bring him down.  It's well acted and filmed. In the trilogy the story is allowed to unfold in the span of a few years allowing the characters to develop and not be 1 dimensional.

IA and IA2 are definitely more thrilling and action packed on the level of the old Eastwood, McQueen, Bronson movies, meaning no one has superpowers, no one flies, and there's no CG work.  It does have a very good cast led by Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. IA3 has a little less action and shows the other side of some scenes.  It's a little slower to start, but it grows to a satisfying end.",1171584000,18,834,4.3896103896103895
2717674,5,B000LXS6H0,"So on the same day The Departed hits shelves American audiences finally recieve the original Hong Kong trilogy on DVD. So is it worth the purchase. Definitely in my opinion but don't watch it if you're interested in seeing The Departed. I like Scorsese's adaptation good enough (not enough to call it best picture of the year which it will probably walk away with {at which point does he credit the original filmmakers with his first oscar}) but watching this series before hand it took away some of the suprises that were relevant in that film.

So how are these films not compared to their American counterpart? Well the first one hits all the right notes as suprisingly slick an intelligent thriller. I don't get all of the religious ideas that the filmmakers used in writing the script but you can't deny the power of the filmmaking and writing put forth. Theres a nice back and forth and when the suprises that ruined The Departed they are rather well timed for the perfect emotional payoff. The acting is great, and I didn't even mind the comic relief from Chapman To as one of the gangsters. And to bolster the acting writing that makes the characters deeper than they'd be in a lesser film. I will also say the darker ending in which things don't go as planned for the hero also gets higher marks in my book.

Infernal Affairs II is a prequel that was made directly after the original showing how the policeman was recruited to be a mole and spy on his uncle, a mobster trying to hide his doings and avenge the murder of his father by Mob boss Sam and the soon to be police mole Ming. Theres was a lot that I loved in this film making me overlook the faults, mainly that it went on a little too long and could be overly dramatic at times. Joining the cast for this outing Carina Lau is great as wife of mob boss Sam who's the secret love of Ming and in love with Anthony Wong. And Francis Ng is just excellent as the villain of the film. This was the first film I noticed him in and I've been a fan ever since in films like The Mission or Exiled.

Infernal Affairs III. I won't say much about this one as doing so would spoil events in part one. Just to say it involves a character surviving from the first one who's deceit is driving him slowly insane. Again this film goes on too long and was melodramatic in places, but the writing was so good and the characters so interesting that in my opinion this little craveat didn't bother me as much as it would others. Excellent additions to the cast include Leon Lai as a shadowy cop who might be another triad mole, and Hero's Chen Dao Ming playing a mainland gangster who in flashbacks was scene to be setting up business with Eric Tsangs Sam and in the present is seen as shadow character whose motivations aren't known.

Anyway to wrap this up as I feel I've gone into ramble mode. This is a real good series that entertained the hell out of me. I haven't seen The Dragon Dynasty release, but everything here is good enough to warrant a look from fans of the Scorsese film are fans of Hong Kong films in general.",1171238400,22,3071,4.354275741710297
2717675,5,B000LXS6H0,"It's a shame that certain films only gain the attention they deserve once remade into the English language.  There is nothing gained (and quite a bit lost) by remaking these films for an English-speaking audience.  Everything you need is here (tension, drama, intrigue).  What a pleasure it is to see superior quality films finally get their due.",1171152000,15,346,5.035087719298246

8165269,5,B000LXS6H0,If you have seen The Departed by Martin Scorcese then you have seen the first of the Infernal Affairs and may not want to purchase the box set.  There are some minor differences between those two movies but most of the major plot points and twists are the same.  The second movie is more of a prequel than a sequel but most of the main characters are in this movie even if they are younger( and played by younger actors).  The third movie is the direct sequel to the first Infernal Affairs and I think the weakest.  It seems to be more of an acting showcase for Andy Lau than anything else.,1427155200,,590,4.241071428571429

8165271,5,B000LXS6H0,"Infernal Affairs Trilogy is a series of films - Infernal Affairs I,II and III - that tells the story of a police officer who infiltrates the Triads and a police officer secretly working for the same gang. The first film tells their battle and the personal struggles they both undergo as they try to fulfill their duties secretly. The second film is about their days as young people. The third film narrates the spiritual battle and psychological struggles during the transformation of a Triad member into becoming a real policeman. This is a must own trilogy especially those who enjoyed the series immensely.",1410307200,,609,4.922330097087379
8165272,1,B000LXS6H0,"I don't know why this series got so many great reviews via Amazon posts.  It is pretty awful; poor and confusing plot, just terrible acting and the whole series is disjointed and very hard to follow and keep the bad and good guys separate - one would need to use a score card.",1404345600,,276,4.2075471698113205

8165274,4,B000LXS6H0,"I'm not always okay with watching foreign language films with subtitles but I don't think the dubbed one they show on cable tv is worth watching.

The original English subtitles are okay in my opinion.

I watched this standing at a film festival having no idea what I would be seeing and found myself instantly terrified.

Part One is excellent.  It's a nonstop beating to the brain.  There are so many messages in Part One.

Part Two which was explained heavily in the press before its release is about how venal and callow the youth are who join the triad are - but there's an unspoken message - how is it possible integrity-wise for the son of the triad to want to join the force.  If you were true police, really honorable, you don't go near them if you aren't clean and cleared.  You don't glom on.

Part Thee surprisingly is awesome because I was never a fan of Leon Lai but I was for this film and haven't seen him in anything since.  I loved that in some death fantasy (funereal blue cords abound in this film as if we were in some Mulholland Drive type of dream), the hero of Part One is validated by Mainland and higher up Hong Kong police.

But given Part Two's origin story of the ""hero""  this could just be the grandiose fantasy of some scion of crime wanting something that doesnt belong to him.  In any case, Leon Lai's character in Part Three is very satisfying.

Certain things, preferences, loyalties, prejudices don't belong to the prodigals.",1402012800,,1461,4.484848484848484
