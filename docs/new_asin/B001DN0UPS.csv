8294197,5,B001DN0UPS,"One of my favorite series. The box art is great, the silver really pops among my other dvds and games.",1389139200,,102,4.15
8294198,5,B001DN0UPS,"All i can say is that this is a great anime/manga. I'm not sure what the person was talking about when they was saying that the manga is different from the anime (hell most of the manga i read were different from the anime). This is just one of the best storyline i've seen in awhile. I'm still reading/watching naruto (and it's my favorite), but Claymore is so cool I can't help but watch. I hate the fact that I have to wait every month to read a new Claymore Manga though (that really blows). Great anime/manga!",1244073600,,514,4.309278350515464
8294199,5,B001DN0UPS,"I'll admit im not a big fan of the bloodier Anime. Which this one contains a lot of.

But the story is actually so compelling I totally over look the blood.

Great main story, good build up and great plot twists.

I wouldn't compaire this to Lodoss as this seems way more ""adult"" then the Lodoss series. I would more compare this to the anime Berzerk. A good story about brotherhood (or I should say sisterhood).",1236988800,,412,4.394736842105263
8294200,5,B001DN0UPS,"I agree with what an earlier review stated about this being as awesome as ROLW.  I used to be an avid anime watcher. But somewhere along the line I lost interest in them. Claymore revived that interest. This is a serious anime. The way I like em. No joking and silly plots. They get to the point. Awesome story, artwork and lets not forget the soundtrack. The only thing that people wouldn't like is the fact that it ends. Whereas the manga continues {even now}

Personally I see that as a good thing. Seeing as though the manga isn't finished, we'd of been subject to FILLER had this anime continued. I can't watch Naruto or Bleach for that very reason.  Gimme the good stuff or nothing at all I say.  Claymore does that. It follows the manga 100 % until the last few episodes where they change it in order to wrap it up. I don't see anything wrong with stopping while you're ahead. Go on too long people {like myself} get bored and quit caring. Some people just need closure, I'm glad SOME animes still believe in that.",1225670400,9,1021,4.386243386243386
8294201,5,B001DN0UPS,"""Claymore"" is one of the best anime series of 2008, if not the best.

The plot starts off simple--humans coexist with dangerous, deadly beasts known as Yoma. They are the most powerful beings on the planet, and can turn other people into Yoma. The only way in which humans have been able to defeat the Yoma is through hired help from Claymores, female exterminators who are half-human, half-Yoma.

Raki's family was killed by Yoma, but Raki is lucky to meet the Claymore who helps him, named Clare. Although she is somewhat nonchalant about Raki, she helps kill the Yoma responsible for murdering his parents. Clare leaves, but the villagers kick Raki out, in fear of being attacked by Raki. After all, Raki did make contact with the Yoma, so he could kill the other villagers.

Although Raki passes out in a sandstorm, Clare comes to rescue him. After a difficult battle with a Yoma, Raki befriends Clare. Raki then learns everything about Claymores.

Only the Claymore warrior's human side keeps them from turning into a Yoma. And Clare is very fortunate to have Raki to help her. Even though I've never seen a guy cry as much as Raki, he becomes her emotional support.

Thus, ""Claymore"" becomes a fascinating series, in which females are actually the more powerful and independent beings. Raki actually becomes the caretaker for Clare, cooking for her and making sure that she is okay. I feel weird stating this, but ""Claymore"" is really an incredible series for the new millenium, in which the male characters must actually help the powerful, dominating females. The gender roles are switched in this anime, making for a more engaging look at how the gender roles have changed in recent years.

Even though Raki cries just as much as Shinji Ikari in ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" he makes for an intriguing character. He cares greatly for Clare, who has to stay unemotional in her duty as a Claymore.

Clare is even more fascinating. She is the unemotional warrior who chose to take the path of a warrior, killing Yoma. Whenever her Yoma side becomes too dominating, she goes out of control, and even asks Raki to kill her when her adrenaline level reaches an uncontrollable level. Thankfully, Raki is able to embrace and give her the love she needs.

It's an incredibly earth-shattering fantasy, and a drama that reaches such an incredibly high level. It's definitely my current favorite of 2008, and it deserves a lot more attention than it's gotten so far.",1225411200,,2460,4.826603325415677
8294202,5,B001DN0UPS,"Yes, I get goose bumps thinking about it finally being encoded into MPG on a disc.

I have the fansubs on my hard drive from a couple years back...

but now it finally got licensed here in america!

I won't even bother listening to the dub, but hey, if that is what you want....

The manga rips on this anime of course, but any true anime fan has to agree that chicks killing monsters with swords, well, that is about as good as it gets.",1222300800,4,437,4.105882352941176
8294203,1,B001DN0UPS,"As a warning to those who haven't seen this series yet or read the manga, DONT read the manga if you want to actually like this anime.

I have seen the entire series, and if you read the manga you'll realize just how much this anime got royally screwed in the end of it.

Also if you pay attention the quality in the artistry slowly drops as the anime progresses. Towards the end it was almost unbearable.

This was by far the biggest DISAPOINTMENTS of an anime I've ever come across. If you like the anime and want to keep it that way again I say DONT read the manga. It will leave you 100% pissed off with the direction the anime went and is now leaving the story. About the last 5 or so episodes the story COMPLETELY changes from what it's supposed to be. And what they made it when compared to how the story REALLY goes pales in comparison.

For those of us who did read the manga you know what I'm talking about already. This anime had the potential to become my favorite, but by the end only left me upset.

On a side note I can't wait for the next manga to come out! Story is getting nuts!!!",1222041600,3,1098,4.136150234741784
8294204,4,B001DN0UPS,"To tell u the truth i didn't really like this anime at the biggining, I even stoped watching it after the first couple of episodes, the reason was there was this one kid in there that annoyed me like crazy. But I went back because of boredom and as I watched I started to understand that kid a bit more and he didn't annoy me as much and the show was pretty good too. It has some great women warriors in there with some great fight scenes. I'm difinately gonna buy this series when it is released in english, I just hope the english dub is good. or at least decent. I started reading the Manga as well and it's pretty good, it continues where the anime stops.",1218326400,4,659,4.15625
8294205,5,B001DN0UPS,"Finally, one of the best Fantasy Series since ""Record of Lodoss War""  comes to DVD in the western hemisphere.
I know the series allready but nothing could keep me from ordering this the minute I saw it on preorder!
If you love Fantasy Anime with a side heart breaking love Story, this is the Anime you should own!
Trust me, you'll love it!",1217808000,12,339,4.380952380952381
