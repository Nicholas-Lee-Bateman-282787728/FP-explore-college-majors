Should be re-mastered.",1399507200,,129,4.375
8091928,5,B000BT96KK,"I highly recommend this DVD ... What a wonderful show, it is a shame that the Hollywood of today is no longer able to produce such fine quality entertainment ...
The audio on this DVD is excellent ... The video quality, once one realizes the age of the shows, is very good ... People we need to remember that they were not recording shows in 1080p High-Def/Blu-Ray 50+ years ago ... Again once you deal with that fact, the overall quality of the video is very good ... This disc is hosted by the late Ronald Reagan and comes from the 1956 season of ""General Electric Theater"" which ran from 1953 - 1962 ... Titles of the 4 shows you get are are below:
* Summer Promise: w/ Joan Fontaine
* Easter Gift: w/ MacDonald Carey
* Estaban's Legacy: w/ Ricardo Montalban
* The Hat w/ Roses: w/ Gisele Mackenzie
Now, this disc produced/manufactured by Alpha Home Entertainment ... and I have read numerous reviews criticizing the quality of their products, along with this disc I have now purchased 3 classic/vintage television shows all 3 from Alpha Home Entertainment ... They do a fine job and produce a quality product for a very reasonable cost ... I applaud them for their quality 5 ***** Thanks ...",1294704000,5,1195,4.537037037037037
