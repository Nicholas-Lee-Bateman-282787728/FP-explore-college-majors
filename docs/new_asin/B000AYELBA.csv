2397273,4,B000AYELBA,"The DVD set offers a good variety of shorter (15min) and longer (40min) sessions. Definitely a good buy for the money.

Some of require equipment such as blocks, belts and chairs.",1162425600,5,179,4.774193548387097
2397274,2,B000AYELBA,"I disagree that the is the best of Rodney Yee....and despite the description here, none of these DVDs is for beginners. I bought this set because I LOVE Rodney Yee's Power Yoga Total Body as well as the yoga practise on Body Target ABS. He's very good at reminding about breathing and prompting you on how to move through the poses. This exists in a limited way on Stength Building Yoga and Power Yoga Strength but not on Energy Balance Yoga. Since it's impossible to look at the TV and do the practise, I find it very helpful to have prompts. This set really disappoints in this respect.

Stength Building Yoga says that it's chapter marked for the sequences but it's only marked for the two primary segments. There is no way to move between the numbered sequences in those segments. Although the cover depects Yee outdoors on a beach, the actual practise takes in a studio that is dark and not too attractive. The first segment is fairly standard - sun salutes and standing poses. He names the poses, and mentions breathing but doesn't always tell you how to move into the pose. The second segment is inversions - there is more instruction here but this is in no way for beginners.

On Energy Balance Yoga, there is little instruction for how to move from pose to pose or how to get into the poses and no prompts for proper breathing. He just names poses, sometimes using names that are inconsistant with the pose names used on his other DVDs (side stretch instead of extended right angle pose for instance).

Power Yoga Strength says it's for beginners in the title and there is more instuction about how to move into the poses, but not enough for a beginner to move into very challenging arm balances like pendulum or crane.

Quite frankly all three feel like older practises that have been repackaged as a ""Best of"" set. One of my complaints about the Yoga DVDs I've bought from GAIAM is that the creation dates are missing - there isn't any way to track when a practise might have been recorded. Teachers evolve and improve over time and it would be nice to know whether a given release is older or newer. GAIAM tends to obscure this info....

If you're intermediate/advanced and don't require the prompts - then this set might be ok. If not, I'd try one of Yee's other DVDs.",1161388800,59,2281,4.54014598540146
8080587,5,B000AYELBA,This not a beginner program BUT it is great to use to take your practice for beginner to intermediate.  It is challenging but not impossible.  There are poses I can do and those that I have to work on.  That is why it is called Yoga practice!  I definitely have noticed an improvement in my form from practicing with these DVD's as Rodney Yee has perfect form!,1420848000,,360,4.3283582089552235
8080588,3,B000AYELBA,"I want a yoga class not crashing waves and lovely scenery.  I want something I can follow, in some places he rushes thru so fast I can't keep up.  Pretty much goes for all of his tapes.  You want an opinion, well there you have it.",1387756800,,231,3.9782608695652173
8080589,4,B000AYELBA,"This is a typical Gaiam collection of re-packaged workouts.  This DVD might be a good value for you depending on your specific needs.  I've broken down each of the three included routines below.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-Strength/dp/B00062DKOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga - Strength</a>
The DVD version of this was released in 2004, although the original VHS may have been released even earlier.  Yee moves VERY quickly through this 25-minute vinyasa flow practice.  In particular, he transitions through the sun salutation series so fast that even those familiar with the poses in the series (which is a MUST) will have some trouble keeping up with Yee's pace. MANY downward facing dogs are included, as Yee frequently returns to this posture as a resting pose between more challenging moves. Once he gets to the arm balances, Yee moves a bit more slowly, allowing time to get into more strenuous postures such as Pendulum and Crow and to hold these poses briefly.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strength-Building-Yoga/dp/B00008G76Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strength Building Yoga</a>
My favorite of the re-releases on this DVD, this is actually two practices.  The first routine begins with 16 minutes of vinaysa flows followed by 20 minutes of beginning inversion work. The second practice (about 26 minutes) also starts with vinyasa flows, including balance work, and continues on the floor for more challenging postures, including boat, pendulum, and crane pose.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Energy-Balance-Yoga/dp/B00008G76U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Energy Balance Yoga</a>
This routine was originally released on VHS as ""Yoga Practice for Energy"" back in 2000, and the production values have suffered in translation.  It contains five segments that are meant to be used throughout the day:  Awakening, is 9 minutes of mostly floor stretches; Centering, 7 minutes of standing poses; Creativity (15 minutes), a faster, flowing segment of standing poses and backbends; Reflection, 11 minutes of seated forward bends; and Surrender, final relaxation (4 minutes).

I certainly would not call this the ""Best of"" Rodney Yee:  these practices are showing their age somewhat, and some of his more recent DVDs are certainly better.  However, as noted above, this set might be worthwhile depending on your needs.",1361059200,4,2460,6.116279069767442
8080590,5,B000AYELBA,I really love Yee's Yoga DVDs. This collection is a good challenge & it gives you three different choices so you don't get bored. When my yoga studio closed I bought a small library of Yoga DVD's. These are some of my favorites.,1303862400,,228,4.325581395348837
8080591,5,B000AYELBA,"It is difficult to choose which video is Rodney's best.  I think Gaiam packaged these videos as his ""best"" power yoga routines because they show Rodney's range of helping beginners through advanced.  The three DVD's in this set are Energy Balance Yoga, Power Yoga Strength, and Strength Building Yoga.  As you can guess from the titles, the purpose of the DVDs are to build power, energy, and strength.  There are still a few moves I can't do (like the upper body move where you are sitting in cross legged position with weight entirely resting on arms), but it gives me something towards which to work.)  Don't let my description of this move fool you that you can't do the pracitces.  There are certainly moves that a beginner can easily do. However, there is a reason the word ""Beginner"" is not in the title.  It helps to know at least a little about yoga.  I think this is a great set to push yourself to your next level of practice.",1271548800,,937,4.502958579881657
8080592,1,B000AYELBA,"While doing the P90X I found that I was really enjoying Yoga days, anxious to do & learn more Yoga I purchased this set. The Vinyasa DVD takes forever to start, spending a really long time watching Rodney practice Yoga, when it finally does start the workout is so broken up into little bits that getting a good workout is a lost cause. The Power Yoga DVD is a little better, but the workout is so short it's hardly worth it. I briefly glanced at the third DVD and got so frustrated trying to find the actual workout segments I turned it off. Quite honestly Tony Horton may not be a Yoga Guru, but his Yoga workout leaves this sad set in the dust! I'm really sorry that I purchased it!",1248912000,3,685,4.236641221374046
8080593,5,B000AYELBA,"I'm an advanced beginner, and I've been practicing for about 4 months very actively (almost every day). I think this set was the second item I bought to get me going, and, although it was sheer luck, I don't think I could have chosen better.

There are some challenging poses here, no doubt. But I like that he sprinkles them in. It gives me something to work toward. The first time I saw the Crane posture, I laughed and thought to myself, yeah, maybe I'll try that in a year or two. But, after chipping away at it steadily, I can stay up for 5 full breaths (thank you, thank you, no applause needed). ""Simple arm balance"" is a completely different story. I have a looonnngg way to go on that one. But, again, I'll keep at it.

There are 3 DVDs here: Strength Building Yoga, Energy Balance Yoga, and Power Yoga: Strength. I have to be honest, I've gotten nothing at all out of the Energy Balance DVD, but the other two more than make up for it. (Hey, even if you take Energy Balance out, you're only paying about $14/dvd, and you get the strap - that's not a bad bargain.)

And I do think these DVDs are for beginners, especially since I was a completel beginner when I started: I was totally inflexible, had a lot of lower back pain, and my endurance was tragic. The first few weeks were simply embarrassing, no doubt about it. I couldn't do a lot of the poses - my downward dog looked like a croquet hoop. But you do what you can, rest and recover, and try again. And whattaya know, you get better. And the workout gets easier. It's still not easy, but it's easier.

The two ""strength"" dvds are excellent workouts, and they leave me wasted in a great way. I'm improved a lot over the past 4 months thanks to these workouts and the excellent instruction that voices-over through the workouts.

I've actually given 3 of these boxed sets as gifts, so that should tell you something. And the feedback from those I've given them to is also excellent. So really, if you have nothing else in your arsenal and want to start practicing yoga, this is a very safe bet.

The only reason I say in my title that this isn't actually Rodney's best, is that there's another of his DVDs, a bit more advanced than these, that I think is much better than the ""Energy Balance"" DVD included here. It's called ""Power Yoga: Total Body."" It's about a full hour, and an amazing workout. It's so tough that, at this stage in my development, I don't let myself do it more than twice a week or so, because I'm afraid I might push too hard and end up in traction. But, if that DVD were in this set, I definitely think we'd have his greatest hits.

Also, and this is important if you're a beginner, this set comes with a strap, which is great. But, definitely get yourself a block - they only cost 10 bucks, and although you might only need it for a month or two, during that month you will be very glad you have it!

Namaste!",1227484800,8,2898,4.304587155963302
8080594,4,B000AYELBA,"Let me start with this: I don't bend.  Have never been able to.  I started doing Rodney Yee's Yoga for Athletes when injuries sidelined me from the races I competed in.  I thought maybe some increased flexibility might prevent me from getting injured again.  I love that DVD: slow-paced, good instruction, easy flow and you stay in poses for a while (I've estimated about 20 or 30 seconds, but I've never actually timed it) so you end up feeling your muscles stretch out.  Eventually, I got to a point where I wanted to make yoga a regular part of my workouts to keep me that flexible.

I bought this set thinking ""it's yoga and it's Rodney Yee, so it probably still focuses on all the stuff my first DVD focused on.""  I was wrong.  These are definitely strength workouts (duh...""power"").  I don't notice flexibility increasing near as much as I notice sore muscles that I never knew existed (and also a puddle of sweat on the mat that never occured before).

That said-I love it.  It's much faster paced than what I'm used to, which required adjustment.  Sometimes I have to pause or rewind, so I can practice poses more (or get out of a pose as I have yet to be able to step to a lunge from downward dog).  This doesn't bother me too much as I feel the ""flow"" aspect of the sequences will come with time after I've learned how to breathe without toppling during half-moon pose.  It may, however, bother people who don't like doing yoga with the remote nearby.

I didn't buy this set looking to build strength, but I have certainly  managed to do that in the month I've used them (about 3 times a week).  My friends have noticed that my arms have turned from ""no definition"" to ""rock"". They are quite impressed with my results despite being startled when I cheered at being able to maintain crane pose for four seconds before my arms gave out (mind you this is a huge improvement from the unintentional somersaults I was doing across my living room the first few times I tried).  I'm still searching for a good long workout that focuses on flexibility, but I would definitely recommend this set to someone who has some experience with yoga that is looking for some good strengthening workouts.",1223683200,10,2194,4.525380710659898
8080595,5,B000AYELBA,"These are some great videos. They are easy to follow which is great for a beginner like myself and yet, they are challenging enough that I will not have to replace them anytime soon. Overall great product",1188259200,,204,4.54054054054054
8080596,5,B000AYELBA,"Of course you aren't going to be as good at Yoga as Rodney Yee! But, I found that I can practice the poses to the best of my ability and slowly my flexability is improving. I like that he shows me the highest level, as it inspires me to achieve that strength and ability. Although, it would be helpful to purchase additional instruction if you are totally new to yoga. I really like how he connects the movements to personal awareness and innerpeace. I find his choreography to be very beautiful as well. One drawback is that I can see is that he often repeats some stances so my arms are real tired and it could get boring I suspect, but it hasn't yet for me.",1174348800,9,660,4.246031746031746
