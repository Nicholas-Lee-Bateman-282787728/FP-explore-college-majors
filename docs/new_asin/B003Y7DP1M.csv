4227870,5,B003Y7DP1M,"There are not enough adjectives to express my total and complete excitement about this DVD/CD of All I Ever Wanted by the Airborne Toxic Event!

The film captures so much of the magic of this Unique performance at the world class Disney Hall!  We were there that evening and I promise that this will delight you again and again as it has all of us!

The CD quality is Crisp and Clear and Beautiful....  offering all the songs performed that night.  17 in all...

I just can't wait for their new album which is coming out sometime in Jan 2011!  In the meantime, you will be blown away by this film and CD!!!!!

You will find yourself dancing, humming, singing, laughing, crying and smiling!!!! I guess you can tell that I Loved, Loved, Loved this!!",1285459200,,747,4.481481481481482
4227871,5,B003Y7DP1M,Love Airborne and I can't stop playing the CD.  This band is quality and I believe timeless.,1285372800,,92,4.411764705882353
4227872,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I really liked the debut album from The Airborne Toxic Event; I loved the deluxe edition; this new record is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  I ordered the DVD and CD directly from the band's web site and received it a few hours ago, so I have it before most customers.  Let me admit that I have not watched the DVD yet, but the CD is worth every penny of the purchase in and of itself.  The production quality is great and the arrangements with the symphonic elements are superb.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next studio album, hoping that it is in the same vein as this live CD.  The use of orchestral instruments together with the band is absolutely amazing.",1284681600,2,648,4.4576271186440675
4227873,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I had only heard a few of The Airborne Toxic Event's songs before the night I attended the LA premiere of the film, All I Ever Wanted.  I left the theater wanting to own every song they've ever done and beg them to write more!  This is a beautiful documentary, featuring rehearsals, interviews and the concert.  It showcases this amazing and talented band not to mention incredible guest artists including The Calder Quartet, a high school marching band and more!  Beautifully shot, you not only get a sense of who this band is a group, but who each member in the band is as a person and how special this night was to everyone who was a part of it- including the audience.  What I would have given to be in the audience in the gorgeous Disney Concert Hall that night!  The production team of Wheelhouse Creative caught lightning in a bottle and we're lucky enough to get to enjoy it.  Enjoy the heck out of it.  I can't wait to get my copy!!",1283904000,2,941,4.367816091954023
4227874,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I love the Airborne Toxic Event, and have for years now. They are a wonderful band, and a great example for my 13 year old daughter, who wants to be a musician when she grows up.

That being said, this DVD/CD set is a must have! It gives great ""behind the scenes"" footage, along with the live concert footage. I was at that concert, and the DVD gives the same feeling the concert did. If you missed the concert, don't miss this DVD. If you attended the concert, you'll want to buy the DVD to show to your friends and family.

I ordered my DVD from the bands website, and I was really excited when it arrived on September 4th. Buy it! I promise you won't regret it!",1283731200,4,664,4.1796875
4227875,5,B003Y7DP1M,"Short and to the point: Loved it. Great. The documentary/concert covers The Airborne Toxic Event's great live performances on a very special show and takes fans behind the scenes for a more intimate look at the band and their preparation for this one of a kind concert. Interesting way of getting to know the members and their charm. Great audio quality and sharp picture (Note: all the documentary portions of the film are in black and white, performances are in color... gives a special ""lively"" effect to the beautiful music on sometimes painfully honest subjects). The concert itself eatures a nice selection of TATE songs plus a couple covers. A must have for any fan. If you were not fortunate enough to attend the event you NEED to see this. TATE at its finest. Much respect and appreciation for the band after watching this. The special features add a little value with some short clips of the band, some commentary, and an extra song from the conert not included in the film portion. Do notice the blu-ray version does not include the Audio CD that comes bundled with the Deluxe DVD version(get both!... or at least the Deluxe CD).",1283472000,3,1140,4.733668341708543

4227882,5,B003Y7DP1M,I normally don't like watching rockumentaries (except Spinal Tap of course) but this one was great and the music is really good. So nice to see musicians who write their own songs and actually know how to play an instrument.,1400630400,,224,4.625
4227883,5,B003Y7DP1M,Having both a DVD (get to see/know ATE) for home and a CD for the car makes this a double win.  There are a couple of great songs here I haven't heard elsewhere.,1388448000,,161,3.878787878787879
4227884,5,B003Y7DP1M,Truely stunning - breathtaking - exhausting to think that someone could write such an amazing piece of art! I completely and total agree with Mr Haley when he states that it is unimaginable that they could top Sometime Around Midnight - but they did! I only wish the radio stations would wake up and start pounding out ATE mainstream - been a very long time since a bad has moved me like this! Enjoy - it is a real treat!,1371686400,,421,4.275
4227885,5,B003Y7DP1M,"TATE gets a 5 star rating for their music. The DVD gets a 3 star rating for the possible issue with the sound. I'll keep the DVD, however I think there needs to be better quality control.",1368403200,,187,4.081081081081081
4227886,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I don't know what I'd expected from this Disney concert but I was very pleasantly surprised. Very enjoyable, especially getting all the background on the creative process. Highly recommend this to any fan of TATE.",1367539200,,213,5.114285714285714
4227887,5,B003Y7DP1M,Outstanding video and audio quality.  Fantastic songs. You can really get a feel for the band's personality and how much they care about what they are doing.,1363305600,,157,4.814814814814815
4227888,5,B003Y7DP1M,"Everything was perfect. Got the DVD fast, ordered it, had it maybe 3 or 4 days later, absolutely nothing wrong with it. Very happy with the service.",1356220800,,148,4.518518518518518
4227889,3,B003Y7DP1M,"I'm a huge Airborne fan, so I picked this up to add to my collection, as there are a few tracks on here that aren't on their normal albums.

A few notes:

1 - I'm not sure if I just got a bad copy, but the Blu-Ray would not play in my PS3 when I clicked ""play"" - it would just enter a loop, playing the same 1-2 minute track, and showing the same images, until I bailed back out to PS3 main menu.  I was able to make it play by going to the scene selection, and starting with the first chapter.

2 - Be aware that unlike the DVD version, this version does not come with an audio disc - so if you were hoping to easily get the tracks onto an mp3 player/iPod, you won't really be able to.  I stupidly assumed that if the DVD version came with an audio CD, this would too - whoops; should've read the description.

Other than those complains, the Blu-Ray was awesome.  Airborne puts on a great show, even recorded.",1331510400,2,911,4.027777777777778
4227890,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I first saw this DVD on VH1 and loved the fact that it was a very special night for ATE. I was not a fan of Nor even heard  much of their music prior to seeing the show. But I soon turned into a fan because of that one night. I am a huge fan of live music and love the being in the moment vibe. This was a DVD/CD combo so I again thought it was very well done. I really enjoy the fact that this seems to be the way a lot of musicians release live DVD's Now. Adele's ""live at Royal Albert Hall"" and the Rolling Stones ""Some Girls Live in Texas"" both come this way and its worth the little extra you pay IMHO. If you are like me and love Live Music you will not be let down!",1324080000,,672,3.699300699300699
4227891,4,B003Y7DP1M,"I really enjoy watching this film. The filmmakers did a good job capturing the personality of the band. Camera angles during the concert were good; very simple without any music video-like effects. I recently saw The Airborne Toxic Event live at a free show sponsored by a Philadelphia local radio station. I think it's awesome that a band with this amount of success still does small gigs like these. ""All I Ever Wanted"" demonstrates that they can put on a fantastic concert hall-type show, but they can also put on an awesome rock concert. I took off a star because on the blu-ray version there is a glitch in the play button where it freezes up and you have to restart the player. I have to start the film by selecting the first scene from scene selections. I don't know if every copy is like this, but I have a friend who also owns the blu-ray version and he has the same problem. Well worth the money, I've seen this documentary about 10 times and I still enjoy watching it. Great filmmaking, great personalities, and great music!",1314576000,,1035,4.540106951871658
4227892,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I'm not a music expert. But I do know good music when I hear it. The talent this group of musicians
have is unbelievable. One evening while channel surfing, I heard this wonderfully different music. I stopped and gave a listen. I was truly enjoying this music. I'm a 60's and 70's music lover. And I'm not to impressed by the music out today. But Airborn Toxic Event is music I am sharing with my generation of music lovers. I'll be watching these guys.",1308182400,,453,4.404761904761905
4227893,3,B003Y7DP1M,"Blu Ray:  I looked very forward to this and it is great with the exception of the audio mixing and editing decisions.  Why on Earth do they run the interviews with mostly only  the center channel and volume  levels much higher than the music concert sections (maybe a equalization change also)?  I was forced to consistently turn the audio levels down each time they dived into dialog.  That took much away from the overall pleasure of the disc!  Too bad!  I believe it was also shot mostly with digital SLR video cameras, certainly not the hi-def experience it could and should have been.  I also thought the selection of clips and angles was rough and showed focus racking which was rather crude.  Am I glad to have this, yes.  It should have been more professionally edited and post produced however, and that stays with it, too bad!  TATE deserves better than this.  Great performance with some wobbly post and capture decision making.  It is a shame it wasn't better than this.  I love this band and wanted this to be more perfect, like their music.
Later:  I re-watched this again and I believe it was shot using digital still cameras in HD video mode at 24 frames per second (movie frame speed), causing some jerkiness when played back rather than the normal 30 fps.  Unless you are able to set up your equipment to 24 fps, you MAY experience the same problem.  It still is worth having, just not as much.
NOTE:  This review is on the Blu Ray disc, not the DVD!  Most reviews are for the DVD, which may not contain these technical problems.
This unfortunately does not also contain the CD which the DVD deluxe set does contain, bummer!",1293753600,3,1642,4.558219178082192
4227894,5,B003Y7DP1M,It was great to hear such a great album and remember seeing the band live all over again. My wife and I loved it!,1293235200,,113,3.75
4227895,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I've been waiting for a new CD from The Airborne Toxic Event ever since i purchased their first one.  I saw ""All I Ever Wanted""  and snatched it up.  I am very happy with it...i love the live versions.  Still waiting for a new one though...I love this group!",1291680000,,258,4.204081632653061
4227896,5,B003Y7DP1M,"Although happiness may be overrated, the mutual happiness of the young female singers, the high school marching band, The Airborne Toxic Event and their audience, and what they all experienced on December 4th, 2009, was decidedly not overrated. It was so clearly a peak collaborative moment that will stay with those children, their families, as well as the band for a lifetime. Meaningful. ""All I Ever Wanted"" appears to be making these types of meaningful connections with people and clearly the band was a resounding success in accomplishing this. I was moved to tears when the Latina girls started singing back-up, ""I swear, I swear.""

What I loved most about the Disney Hall video, above and beyond the wonderful rock and roll, was how it celebrated Mikel Jollet and the band's desire to share the warmth, excitement, energy, and passion of their work with the East Los Angeles community to obvious benefit and delight of all parties.",1291075200,2,939,4.980891719745223
4227897,5,B003Y7DP1M,"Rock and Roll and Classical Music are sworn opposites, but their sexual chemistry is so strong that they usually wind up hooking up - a lot. TATE is a young band, and usually orchestral albums are embraced by bloated arena bands much later in their life cycle (Metallica, Kiss, Guns & Roses, etc.), but lately indie kids like The Decemberists are jumping on the bandwagon, so heck, why not TATE.

The DVD
Much like The White Stripes' Under The Northern Lights, this film plays as much like a documentary on the band and the event of planning this unusual concert as it does being a concert film. It's a wonderful introduction to the members of the band who have yet to be thrust into celebrity. The focus is on the music. And blissfully, every time the doc cuts to a song, it plays it all the way through.

The CD
Much like Foo Fighters' Skin & Bones and Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, the sound is so crisp and intimate, it plays like a high fidelity studio album. Here, we find TATE's stellar debut re-imagined and expanded. New songs (Duet being the concert's highlight) and covers (The Ramones) are introduced, as are string quartets, a children's choir and a marching band (think Fleetwood Mac's Tusk for the new century). A pure joy to listen through - enough treasure to hold us off until the new album drops in 2011.",1287619200,3,1327,4.548117154811716
4227898,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I bought this dvd at a live show, which was just as amazing. They are on tour with the Calder Quartet right now and I had to have a recorded version of their songs with the Calder Quartet. I can't say enough good things about this dvd or the band. I would recommend this album to anyone.",1287100800,,287,4.052631578947368
4227899,5,B003Y7DP1M,"Let me provide a little context. I am an old guy, in my early 60s. I grew up with rock and have never lost my passion for it. For decades my favorite band was Yes. A number of years ago they were deposed by Mike Scott and the Waterboys. The Flower Kings had some time in the spotlight and there were probably others, like Brian Wilson and eels that hovered at or near the top. Earlier this year however I became completely besotted by Matt Bellamy and Muse. Their live CDs were incredible. I thought there would be some stability at the top of my list, but it was not to be.

I have been a big fan of Airborne since their first CD came out. I happen to regard Sometime Around Midnight as one of the top five or so songs ever put together.

Then along came this DVD. The first thing that jumps out at me about it is that the title song, All I Ever Wanted, is fully the equal of Midnight, something I never considered possible. It is poetic, gargantuan, fragile and has perhaps the greatest buildup of grandeur and passion from start to finish that I have ever heard in my life.

This DVD left me crying. It is so extraordinary, not just for the wonderful music played absolutely perfectly, but for the insight into the folks in the band. The more I learn about Mikell Jollett, the more I regard him as one of the most brilliant folks on earth. Have you ever read any of his writing? He's a magnificent writer who kind of reminds me of David Foster Wallace. He was well along writing his first novel, aided by a healthy advance from a major publishing house, when his personal life just collapsed and he decided to switch to music. In a way, their first CD can be viewed as a soundtrack for a novel, which would be a first. Mikell is very new to music, which is hard to believe. He brings a brilliant melodic sense, a great gift for lyrics, a magnificent and powerful voice, an incredibly emotional presentation and one of the greatest smiles on earth. Check out the moment when the grade school choir gets their first ovation from the audience and Mikell turns back to look at them with this amazing smile. They all seem like marvelous people and their musicianship is breathtaking, especially if you consider the Calder Quartet to be a real part of the group, which I do.

To my ears and eyes this is the most powerful and wonderful music DVD I have ever seen. It would serve as a perfect introduction to the band, which is now, I must admit, my favorite in all the world. I beg everyone reading this to check this out. YouTube has a clip up from the DVD of the band doing All I Ever Wanted. If you can resist that overwhelming piece of music, you should watch it again.

I will stop now. Enjoy.",1286668800,68,2695,4.297244094488189
4227900,5,B003Y7DP1M,"So I bought this cd/dvd set when I saw the band on concert in chicago, and I gotta say I have watched the entire DVD more than once. I just can't get enough of this band, and can't wait for their next album.  I even got to meet the guys after the show and got their autograph on the dvd cover.

4227904,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I'm a massive (and one of the first) Airborne Toxic Event fans and I must say this dvd is them at their best. I've seen them live, but that performance was not nearly as impressive as this one. The old favorites from the ""Let's Not Die"" demo and the first album are there as always, but the new songs and covers are supurb. Every time I hear ""The Book of Love"" and ""Duet"" I get a little teary-eyed. That having been said, I feel like the dvd (or at least my edition) is missing a song or something because the Mexican folk dancers are only in the encore and they don't even dance, even though the pictures in the album art and the trailer have them actually dancing and performing. Makes me wonder if there was some sort of error...",1285891200,,732,4.235714285714286
4227905,5,B003Y7DP1M,"I just finished watching the Blu Ray and I'm totally blown away.

TATE are known not only for their music, but for their devoted fans as well. Anyone watching this film will come away with a better understanding of both. The performance in this unique venue for a rock show is a testament to the musicianship of this group of talented artists. They fill the stage and the auditorium.

But the film is about more than the music. TATE's fans are so devoted because Mikel, Anna, Steven, Darren, and Noah are genuine reluctant rock stars. They are the underdogs who won the big game, who love every minute of their fame not for the adulation but because they can share their joy. They smile while they perform.  They bring the local high school marching band and children's choir on-stage with them. They appreciate that the audience has come to see them, because they can hardly believe it themselves.

I saw TATE live in Boston in April, 2009. This film captures the same energy and the same connection between the band and the audience that I felt at the show.  If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan, you will be won over.",1285632000,6,1147,4.521739130434782
