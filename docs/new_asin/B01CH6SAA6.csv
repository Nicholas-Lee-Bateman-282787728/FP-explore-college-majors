7682822,5,B01CH6SAA6,I own this movie. This was a purchase for a friend. One of the best biblical movies ever made. Very captivating and well acted.,1476144000,,127,4.333333333333333
7682823,5,B01CH6SAA6,"Outstanding film, the most accurate Scriptural portrayal of this engrossing, historical story that I have seen. Yes, there are sexual suggestions and violence, because that's what really happened. The story would lose its fidelity to true facts as the depth of its lessons without them.  But the portrayal is in good taste, and both the cinematography and acting are outstanding. The superb performances are what you would expect from Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau, and Paul Mercurio played a fine role as Joseph.",1475884800,3,514,5.192771084337349

7682825,1,B01CH6SAA6,"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies. This is an okay movie. I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives. The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people. My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

Potiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis. The scene does not show sexual parts of course, but her hand goes down pretty deep. She invites him to sleep with her a few times.

There are several extremely offensive references to women, like ""they talk to much"" or ""they gossip.""

Again, the movie is okay and the sex scenes did not offend me. My problem is that the movie is not rated and it should be at least PG13. I wish I had not watched that movie with my two daughters. I am upset.",1471564800,8,1284,4.343096234309623

7682829,5,B01CH6SAA6,Great movie and so true to the Bible. Our High School Sunday School class studied Genesis and now have been watching Joseph after 2 others.

7682845,5,B01CH6SAA6,"I read the Bible often and so know the stories in it well.  This DVD of ""Joseph"" was done very well!  It wasn't ""Hollywood"" as so many of the Biblical stories can be.  It followed the story well, and Joseph, Potipher and the Pharoah acted out the parts really well.  I'm trying to find more Biblical stories that actually follow the Bible and aren't ""Hollywood"", and I haven't yet found any others - EXCEPT for the Gospel of Luke.  That is an exact narration of Luke from the Bible with actors ""behind"" the narration.  These actors actually look Jewish or Middle Eastern - not European!  And you can hear them speaking Aramaic behind the narration.  I liked it a lot!",1521331200,,667,4.5
7682846,5,B01CH6SAA6,This is one of our all time favorite Bible movies.  Well done and very moving (especially when he confronts his brothers who sold him).  Wonderful movie!,1520985600,,153,4.846153846153846

7682850,4,B01CH6SAA6,"I was thinking these straight to DVD videos were going to have bad acting. I was pleasantly surprised. Good acting and it mostly stuck to the Bible...even though it did take some ""dramatic license"" from time-to-time.",1516665600,,216,5.027777777777778
7682851,5,B01CH6SAA6,"I hesitated between this movie and the old one for a few days, but ended up picking this one.  I got it and watched it that week and I was so surprised!  It was just about accurate and I really liked that they showed Joseph's life as a young boy,  what he went through with his brothers..which was portrayed well and the people he served as a slave.  It was graphic due to knives and blood.  Leslie Ann Warren who played the part of Potifar's wife, well I did not particularly care that they chose her for the role because she was very sexual and honestly,  I wish they'd picked someone else, but that is Hollywood.  All of those things happened in the Bible , you just don't see the pictures.  I liked most all of the movie because it teaches about Betrayal, Jealousy, Love, and Forgiveness and we can all learn from the stories in the Bible and apply them to our lives, and use the way they handled their situations as tools for ourselves when we go through something.  I also liked the man who played Jacob who served the God of Israel and the people who played his sons, wives, and daughter.  It was just good and I would recommend it, just watch it before you let your kids under 13 watch. Once the parents or parent watches it, they will know if they will want their kids to watch.",1516406400,3,1287,4.2592592592592595

7682854,5,B01CH6SAA6,"I watched this when I was young and a lot of it went over my head, for obvious reasons, but it stuck in my head and it's the movie I come to when I'm in the mood for a retelling of Joseph. Another classic! The cast, acting, soundtrack were all superb!",1514332800,,251,3.9411764705882355
7682855,5,B01CH6SAA6,"This is a close-to-original Bible story with great acting. The quality of the production is excellent. The final scene is, of course, poignant. A friend of mine had a forgiveness breakthrough toward a family member after watching this movie.",1513814400,4,241,5.205128205128205

7682870,5,B01CH6SAA6,"This is my second copy. I wore out the first one. Not only is it the direct story of Joseph but of his brothers, like Judah. It goes into depth of Judah and his sons and their wifes and the consequences he suffers because of what happened to Joseph. It is like 3 hours long and no time wasted. I cannot find anything that takes away from the accuracy of the Bible and would ruin the movie. AWESOME",1496793600,,397,4.102564102564102

7682874,5,B01CH6SAA6,"I love this movie about Joseph. Yes poetic license, but it tells the story of Joseph how it could have easily happened, giving a good idea of what it must have been like to be him. Well played out.
