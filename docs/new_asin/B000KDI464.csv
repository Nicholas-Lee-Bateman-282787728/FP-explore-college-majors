8155690,4,B000KDI464,"This loose adaptation of Willa Cather's 1906 McClure's magazine piece first aired on PBS's ""American Short Story"" series in 1980. The program's host, Henry Fonda was clearly in declining health here.

SYNOPSIS--
Paul is a starry-eyed youth from suburban Pittsburgh who questions what's already been determined for him by parental and societal expectations. A totally unmotivated student, Paul often spends his evenings in the company of those he finds glamorous-- actors. He's chronically late for school and falls asleep in class. When his uncaring recitivism brings a suspension from high school, Paul's father insists that he take a pre-arranged job.

To this point Paul's perceived existence has been gray and oppressive-- a busy offiice environment is saddest of all.

Given 2K to deposit in employer Denny & Carson's bank account, the thrill seeker absconds with their funds. Paul rides the train to NYC, buys a Brooks Brothers suit and takes a suite of rooms at the Waldorf Astoria. An elegant but unsustainable upper class Gilded Age lifestyle lies in stark contrast to the reality of Paul's troubled world, and dire consequences of his embezzlement clearly foreshadow a tragic denouement.

Eric Roberts is outstanding as Paul; also interesting is Tom Stewart's ""hale fellow well-met"" Yalie who invites him to indulge in some cat house recreation. This invitation is declined when Paul spots his father at the hotel's front desk. Hasty flight from responsibility ends alongside a rural Pennsylvania rail track.
