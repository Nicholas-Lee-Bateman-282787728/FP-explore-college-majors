8381294,5,B002UJIY5M,"Very interesting, I cannot say anything bad about it. I wish It was longer and there was more! Very educational about tribes and their way of life. Great if you are interested in anthropology.",1329004800,,192,4.676470588235294
8381295,5,B002UJIY5M,"I saw this on Netflix and ordered it as a holiday gift for a doctor friend. It's absolutely fascinating; my only disappointment being that there are only four episodes, I was kind of hoping it was to be a continuing series.
Not that these two might make it through an entire series; what another reviewer mentioned about them playing Russian Roulette with these exotic medicines is quite true. I couldn't believe some of the stuff they tried.
That said, as someone who has lived in Asia I think its wonderful to see medical professionals exploring other countries/cultures contributions to medicine instead of dismissing them out of hand for western cures.
This series is both informative and entertaining - and, as an added bonus, the twin doctors ""Chris"" and ""Xand"" are good looking guys with attractive accents.",1326412800,,814,4.992647058823529
8381296,5,B002UJIY5M,"had seen the broadcast once before in the Danish TV, but could not buy it here in Denmark. So ordered it here on Amazon, and it
received 4 weeks early than what I had expected. super good service. And I love watching it",1300060800,,219,4.116279069767442
8381297,5,B002UJIY5M,"The twinbrothers and doctors Chris and Alexander Van Tulleken want to find out, whether western medicine can learn
anything from the healing methods of tribal people.
In 4 stunning episodes they travel to some of the remotest places on Earth (including arctic Russia and the Kongo Basin in Africa) and live with the natives of these regions.

It seems that the brothers have a passion for Russian Roulette. Their experiments involve drinking a semi poisonous drug used by South American Indians in order to hallucinate. They submit themselves to rituals in Malaysia and India
in which their cheeks and tongues are pierced with metal skewers to see whether you can overcome pain by putting yourselve into a state of trance. The outcomes of some of these experiments are sometimes shocking, sometimes hilarious.

You see how the Baiaka pygmies in Africa deal with diseases, and learn how the inhabitants of Nepal(near Tibet) use plants to treat severe injuries. The twins live with the Chukchi,the indigenous peoples of arctic Russia and see how their diet of fish and sea mammals lowers the risk of heart disease. In the peruvian rainforests they are introduced into the beliefs of the Ashaninka Indians and the use of drugs by shamans to fall into a trance or cure people from parasites.

Medicine Men go wild is both medically informative and highly entertaining. This is a must for everyone who liked programmes with Steve Irvine, Bear Grylls or Ray Mears.",1297209600,2,1458,4.991769547325103
8381298,5,B002UJIY5M,"Discovery's nature settings are outstanding in photography. They are producing nature shows that surpass others in there boldness & beauty. You feel yourself traveling with them to places that are simply breath taking and at times so dangerous they could literary take your breath away.
 In Medicine Men Go Wild your going into some places where few outsiders have tread. Your going with two enterprising inquiring young identical twin doctors, educated at Oxford and practicing in London. They are literary going native. They will set up shelter(with native help) built from natural surroundings, eat native foods to survive, use their medicines, and observe. It remended me of Man vs Wild in some of the ways you have to use whats available to eke out a day by day existence.
 There are four episodes:
 1)The Hot Zone- where they treck into the tropical forrest of Central Africa w/ pygmies and experience their foods, medicines, & witness almost exactly how diseases jump from animals to humans. This is the birthplace of some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind. There are scenes here where you wonder how can these doctors actually take the chances they do. One will be the control and step outside the experiment, while his identical twin takes the bullet. Then in another episode they reverse roles. A sort of identical twins Russian Roulette w/nature's wheel spinning either snake eyes, pasadena, surprises, or simply questionable unknowns.
 2) World of Pain- where they treck to Malaysia, India, & Tibet. At the beginning of this episode you wonder???, surely you jest!!! Your not going to subject your twin to that! Yes! Of course, it's done bravely for the the sake of  medicine/science.
 3)Healthiest Hearts- where they treck into Eastern Siberia in northern Russia next to the Artic Sea. Here there is no agriculture or cultivated vegatables, just fat, fish. & sea mammals for food. One brother subsists on that diet only, while the other lives only on processed foods from a nereby local source. They compare their cholesterol levels later & make some surprising discovies.
 4)Jungle Tripping- where they treck into the Peruvian Amazon jungles & examine toxic hallucinogens in medicine. Again, one brother guinea pigs into a local drug rehab that is using toxic hallucinogens as cures with an inhouse pharmaceutical garden of about fifty plants. The psychedelic side effects cause many levels of emotional & psychological tramas. This purging helps w/addictions & psychological problems. Outside rehab, they go deep into the rain forrest to seek local villages and their medicines. They find out that many legendary shamans have been killled by the Shinning Path. But there are still a few left and they find one who begins to show the doctors the ways of the ancestors.
 A very informative & entertaining series.",1268179200,6,2834,5.105831533477322
