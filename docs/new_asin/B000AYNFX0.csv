8081043,5,B000AYNFX0,"Enjoyed this when it aired on ITV in 1994 and again on these dvds.  Superb acting from John Hannah (New Street Law, McCallum); Susannah Harker (House of Cards) and Sir Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective) and a political-newspaper story full of twists keep one interested throughout.  I'm surprised it's not better known.",1428969600,2,323,5.1923076923076925
8081044,5,B000AYNFX0,"It is a good program, but I only bought it because I'm actually in it, I'm the kidnapper with the moustache and the mac on.",1388448000,,123,3.96
8081045,3,B000AYNFX0,I like to watch political based movies. Michael Gambon is great as usual. Supporting cast is so so. The plot was interesting but nothing really new . Not interesting enough for a second watching.  House of Cards Trilogy....now that's something I have watched several times and probably will again.,1380153600,,297,5.061224489795919
8081046,5,B000AYNFX0,"For a three and a half hour drama, I was rivited. It is very British but it is topic as today's headlines

In the age of TMZ and cameras everything, this political thriller about a high ranking government official (Micheal Gambon) trying to hide his private life. His daughter (Susannah Harker) leaks his affair to the press and her boyfriend (John Hannah) being a memmber of the press. So where does the press stop and a private matter begin?

It is good piece of filmmaking. I wish an American production company would take note of this production

8081047,5,B000AYNFX0,"I was gripped by this all the way through. The acting is outstanding and the storyline never lapses into clich&eacute;, with plenty of plot twists to keep the viewer gripped. I was particularly impressed by the writing of Susannah Harker's character - a woman in a TV series that feels like a three-dimensional human being and not just a projection of a male fantasy, but all the characters are complex in the way they are written and portrayed. As well as the three leads - who are all excellent - there is equally impressive support from the likes of Connie Booth, Keith Allen, and Alexis Denisof.",1182902400,20,599,4.660377358490566
8081048,4,B000AYNFX0,"Because I liked all the actors in this, I bought it (pardon the pun) on blind faith, which the acting and story line more than justified.  The plot was realistic  The characters behaved as real human beings would -- sometimes venal, sometimes heroic.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and thought it well worth the price.",1182384000,21,314,4.777777777777778
