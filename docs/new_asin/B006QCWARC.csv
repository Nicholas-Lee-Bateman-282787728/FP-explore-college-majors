8502981,4,B006QCWARC,"The kids (ages 13 and 11) liked the film...watched without also playing on another electronic device.  I, the adult also enjoyed the film.  The movie is about a barbar who has difficulty supporting his family financially as a barbar after a new barbar comes to the area with a shop that has air conditioning.  When a movie star comes to the area to shoot a movie, many in the town learn that the barbar is a friend of the movie star.  The barbar is accosted by the towns people to have an audience with the movie star.  We rate the movie ""G"", no swearing, violence (just some hitting), kissing: etc.  The kids usually prefer much singing and dancing as seen in many Bollywood films, this film has about two dance scenes; the kids liked the film anyway.  We watched with English subtitles, the film is in Malayalam.  We enjoyed listening to the Malayalam and the music track; also the many scenes we hope and assume were from Kerala.  Typical Indian film length of about 3 hours.",1364256000,,978,4.511363636363637
