8233777,5,B000YQFY2E,"I came across a review of this DVD another DVD by Aruna called Dancer's Arms on a bellydance website called The Gilded Serpent.  I was intrigued and ordered both DVDs directly from Aruna.  (We communicated through email, and she came across as very friendly and energetic.

There is not a lot of bellydance content on this DVD, but, it is geared toward helping you get your body in shape for dancing.  It's broken down into sections (legs, core, arms, back and shoulders, etc) and completely works each section.  By slowing down the movements, Aruna helps us to get a deeper, more thourough work out.  There is also a section with light weights. Aruna is a former bodybuilder, so her body is in excellent shape.  There is a strength to her posture and carriage that speaks to that background.  I felt I could trust her to guide me safely through this workout.  Plus, if I really work at it, maybe I can have a body sort of like hers!

Her personality really shines here, and she come across as humorous, upbeat, and friendly.  She uses a voiceover during the workout, which allowed her to comment on the action.  Once, when she was positioning herself for an exercise, she stumbled a bit.  Her face looked startled and the voiceover went ""Whoops!"", but she kept right on going.  It was a very real and funny moment, and I'm glad she allowed it to be seen.

Overall, a very good purchase. A thourough, challenging and fun workout.",1265241600,2,1429,4.592885375494071
