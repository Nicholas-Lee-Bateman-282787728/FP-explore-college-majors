THIS IS THE ARMY
Adapted from Irving Berlin's Broadway production similarly titled This Is the Army, the big screen version employs Jerry Jones (George Murphy) as an entertainer in a show called Yip Yip Yaphank, which is performed entirely by soldiers during World War I. In an unfortunate turn of events, Jerry is wounded in battle, and his dance career is sadly cut short. Wanting to remain in show business, he turns to producing. Then when the U.S. becomes involved in World War II, Jerry decides to put on his own all-soldier revue entitled This Is the Army.

A highlight of the film is an appearance by Irving Berlin himself, singing his version of ""Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning"" and an all-star cast including guests Kate Smith, who sings ""God Bless America,"" and boxing great Joe Louis. Another notable fact about This Is the Army is that all of the box-office and stage production proceeds were donated to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.

SANTA FE TRAIL
Ronald Reagan, Errol Flynn, and Olivia De Havilland headline this thrilling Western, which recounts the legend of infamous abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey), and the heated battle leading to a final showdown with the U.S. Army at Harper's Ferry, Virginiaa bloody encounter that marked the pages of history and changed the course of America forever.

Although Brown's crusade to free slaves is admirable, his methods of doing so are deplorable, and therefore, he must be stopped. Appointed for the job are two young Cavalry officersGeorge Armstrong Custer (Ronald Reagan) and Jeb Stuart (Errol Flynn)friends who share affection for the lovely Kit Carson Holliday (Olivia De Havilland).

The young men are given the risky mission of capturing Brown just days before graduation from West Point as punishment for fighting with fellow classmates. They are consequently sent to Fort Leavenworth (otherwise known as ""bloody Kansas territory"") where John Brown and his gun-slinging cronies have holed up. What ensues at Leavenworth is a treacherous game of cat-and-mouse, resulting in a violent standoff at Harper's Ferry just on the cusp of the Civil War.
