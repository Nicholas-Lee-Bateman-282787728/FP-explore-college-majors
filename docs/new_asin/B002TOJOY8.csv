3985072,5,B002TOJOY8,"The most insightful, all-round treatment of the subject in existence, including the never before discussed international dimension that points to possibly pervasive exploitation and violent abuse of Asian women to feed the trade in their hair. Nobody before now had ever brought that dimension to the public. In this documentary, Rock betters the very best of Michael Moore without the pedantry and with a lot of humor. An A+ work for a first time director.",1265673600,20,457,5.1066666666666665

3985074,1,B002TOJOY8,"I'm disappointed. I thought ""Good Hair"" would be a little more in depth towards real African American cultural issues such as black class structure based on the texture of our hair, Bantu nose and lips, skin tones, and status based on a ""I got Indian Blood in me"", post Jim Crow Black Americans.  To do this documentary in its chosen format was exploitive in itself of our own people.  Why did he not put his wife or girlfriend in the documentary?  He put his daughters in the film because as a father, and at their young delicate age, he obviously has control for what they do now but not his wife or girlfriend.  I'm still trying to figure out why other than to squeeze a few dollars out of something so irrelevant as how a person wears his or her hair knowing it only further instigate stereotype of our people, in particular, black women.  It subliminally agonize the deadly sins of vanity, greed, jealousy, impatience, ignorance, and arrogance.  I would like to think that Black people would collectively consider education as the first and foremost goal to attainment of a better life in current endeavors and guiding a course for future success and desires for our descendents.  Even though blacks appear to spend a lot on their personal grooming for image effect it has been that way since the glory days of Egypt and Northeast Africa.  We have maybe, without proper education of our heritage, forgotten that we set the trends and establish the current fads.  We are not victims concerning this issue because we have the right of choice.  So what if a black woman wears a weave, use perm crme and rollers, or a wig, the most important issue of her presence are the processes of her thoughts and actions as a human being.  I'm sure many of us should spend less time in the mirror and focus more on concerning household and community matters but we have been programmed by media images that have the effect of confusing our most critical priorities.

Chris Rock please utilized your celebrity status of influence to something more enlightening if you're going to do a documentary.  Hollywood is hard these days and I know its work, and we all need work, but there are a number of worthy topics open to documentation that you could have chosen that can be humorous, entertaining, but most important - informative.  Now you have become another entertainer who has sold his soul at the expense of his own.  Just because you were able to convince Angela Mayo and a few other celebrity status individuals to be interviewed on film it still doesn't validate your reasoning.  I'm sure those who were involved are second guessing being a part of that project now.  My challenge to you and any other celebrity who have the means:

DOCUMENTARY THIS

How black crime and criminals affect the local economics of white America.  For every black that turns to crime, they hire 1000 white police officers or more, they hire more Judges, Lawyers, Courts, Corrections Employees, Staff and Prison Guards, Construction Builders of Inmate Facilities, Shrinks, Private and Government Security Firms, Parole Officers, Prison labor for corporate farms, not to mention the amounts of money spent on the logistics of such a grand scheme.  I could go on and on.  We are only 12 percent of America's population which is just enough to keep business going for another hundred years.  We have become a product just as we were before the so called emancipation.  The black mans ignorance, illegal vice, and envious desires for the white mans material status still puts food on the table for a lot of white Americans.  I'm sure if you crunch the numbers you will find out that crime is one of the largest domestic sources of stable employment for whites that no one take stats of.  You have never heard of any employees working in these career fields getting laid off, even during the hardest of economic times.  The will get rid of a military service personnel on a mass scale, but cops?  Never! If you read this review you'll think about it the next time you get a ticket from a cop and have to pay a fine.  Every time one of us do something stupid enough to be incarcerated or fined, remember, we just helped that Cop put food on the table and pay for his for his new pick-up truck, harvesting us, liked market produce.

What happened to those Black Slave Owners of Black Slaves after the civil war in America?

DOCUMENTARY THIS

Why do so many black Americans (mostly males), who mainly populate and dwell in the largest cities in America buy an over priced, four-wheel drive, gas guzzling, off the road-all terrain vehicle that's mainly used in daily city traffic.  It's clearly not economically practical. Why?

DOCUMENTARY THIS

Why President Abe Lincoln is questionable as a great American Hero?

DOCUMENTARY THIS

Why, during the Spanish America War a large group of Buffalo Soldiers defected to the Philippines once they got there from their deployment? Why?

DOCUMENTARY THIS

Why out of all the great film that Denzel Washington and Halle Berry starred in they won Academy Award Oscars for their worst portrayals.  Denzel playing a corrupt, drug dealing, psychopathic, abusive cop and Halle playing a white man's nasty skank irresponsible vice infected slut whore. When clearly Mr Washington's role in ""Glory"", and Ms Berry's role as ""Dorothy Dandridge"", very much warranted such honors?  Why?

DOCUMENTARY THIS

Who was the Great King Negus?

These are some issues worthy of Documentary especially if it's based on blacks as a people and target audience collectively as a group.  It could also turnout to be a great and very profitable movie.  If not, at lease it would be based on something factual, significant, and informative.

When Cris rock wrote and published ""Rock This"" it showed me he was extremely witty and intelligent with potential to do great things within the American media forum, but for now, well, don't waste your money on this crap.

Oh Yeah!  For those Blacks claiming ""Indian Blood"" to explain a reason for the quality of their hair and skin tones you need to know the American Indians hated our guts just like they do today and want nothing to do with us.  Very few of them mixed.  The DNA facts says the American Indian has your African blood in him.  Little do Americans know that there are black Africans with every texture of hair, every shade of skin, and every color of eyes, even certain shades of blue, natural and all real.  I'm Ethiopian.  I have been to Africa and seen it myself.  In fact, if I could swap out the blacks of Addis Abba with the Blacks of Atlanta everyone would pretty much look the same, except for the clothing, and there are no American Indians in Ethiopia!",1259020800,32,6717,4.738156761412576
3985075,3,B002TOJOY8,"Did we really need another documentary showing us how black people are still stigmatized by slavery? NO. However, this is a Chris Rock documentary. It has just enough charm and wit to make it enjoyable. Good Hair is basically a documentary about how blacks have been brainwashed into believing that the straight European hair is good hair and that our natural hair is bad. We created an entire industy on trying to look more like Whitey. LOL You see all these beautiful celebrities talking about there hair weaves. These woman pay thousands of dollars so they can walk around with this so called ""Good Hair."" Every black person can relate to this movie. I can't even count all the times i was told as a child that i had ""Nappy Hair."" Like it was some kind of a disease. This movie really makes fun of how silly we are as a society. However, I don't think it will have any lasting impact. In the future women will still be putting all that fake hair and relaxers in there heads in the pursuit of happiness.",1257724800,34,1005,4.467391304347826
3985076,4,B002TOJOY8,"Comedian Chris Rock takes a look at the lengths some people in the African-American community, especially women, go to for ""good hair"". Near the beginning and end of the movie Rock visits the Bronner Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia, a huge trade convention for the manufacturers of black hair products. Here he highlights four stylists competing for the title of champion platform performer, an elaborate stage show featuring music, dance, costumes and, of course, hairstyling. In between Rock discusses all the time and money spent using relaxer and getting weaves as well as the possible psychological and cultural reasons behind this obsession with hair.

Rock's take on the subject seems to be that it is more important what's in your head than on your head. But it also recognizes the pressures placed on black women to fit in with society's beauty standards and understands why these women forsake their natural hair for perms and extensions. The film delves into serious subjects but maintains a funny and playful tone throughout. I certainly found myself laughing more than I did at the usual Hollywood comedy. And I even left the theater feeling a little smarter about a topic I knew almost nothing about. One of the better documentaries of the year.",1256342400,71,1257,5.014354066985646
3985083,3,B002TOJOY8,"Great Topic, but too Broad a Subject to be Properly Documented in such a Short Film. The Information given here is nothing New, basically what You may have Read in any of tje many Books on Sale or Noted First Hand.
 If the Origin Topic had stayed on Point, then maybe it would have been a better Film. Cris Rock IS Entertaining, and He is really interested in the Hair Trade based on the experiences His very Young Daughters are experiencing and why African Americam Women are ( in the Film's POV) almost Insanely Vain about their Hair to the point of Spending Coin that should be prioritized in a more important area of their Budget, and the Huge amount of Money that is Pumped into a part of the Beauty Industry that makes Billions...Yes Billions from Us, but is only represented by only 3-5% of African American Businessmen.
We are Literally kept out of the Huge Financial Loop when it's obvious that if We were to stop Patronizing their Businesses, the (Asian/Indian) Markets would wither up and fly away!

We are truly Slaves to Our Hair due to Insecurities that weren't fully Addressed  or resolved in the Film.",1510963200,,1117,4.603015075376884

3985086,1,B002TOJOY8,I hated this movie. It portrayed black women as shallow and undesirable only furthering our already low self esteem. I can't believe people actually liked this and thought this was informative. It just felt insulting and disgusting to me. If you really want to know how black women feel watch dark skinned girls on netflix. Although it is not specifically about hair it addresses this issue in a tasteful manner rather than this garbage. I wish chris rock didn't bother since he just set black people back a couple years,1504483200,,520,4.788888888888889

3985100,2,B002TOJOY8,"I had such high hopes for this movie.  I envisioned it being filled with numerous messages and depictions of beautiful natural black hair that would be inspiring not only to Chris Rocks own daughters but to the daughters of many.  However, my hopes were completely dashed.  This film discussed the issue of the negative messages that black women and girls receive about their hair, but it did absolutely nothing to combat them.  In fact, because the primary focus of the movie was on products and contests for manipulating black hair, sadly, he seemed to confirm negative stereotypes about black hair, i.e., the subtext was that black hair is only beautiful when its heavily processed and far from its natural state.  In fact, I don't recall a single image of a black woman with natural hair in all its beauty.  Such a disappointment!  Black hair is naturally beautiful, and I really wish that Chris Rock showed that instead of an expo of hair products and a hair contest.",1486166400,,972,4.7844311377245505

3985250,5,B002TOJOY8,"I really like this movie because it shows how many black women feel about their hair, the lengths that are gone to in order to get one's hair a certain way, and how much is spent trying to have it a certain way. There's one scene where Chris Rock talks to a hairstylists about a certain sew-in, and my boyfriend and I almost fell on the floor when the price was mentioned. $1000-$3000 for some weave!?

The movie also delves into the history of black hair on a business and cultural level. The audience also gets to see the Bronner Brothers Hair Show, which is an international event dedicated hair care and networking. Rock also visit India, where most of human weave comes from. It was interesting to get a different cultures perspective on hair extensions. There's also multiple famous people like who speak about their experiences with black hair.

The film doesn't pass judgment on how black women wear their hair. The film basically ends with, ""Do you boo...but be conscious of what you're doing."" However, the film does recognize that many black women feel pressure to wear their hair a certain way, and do certain things to their hair in order to be acceptable.",1426118400,2,1169,4.669902912621359

3985254,5,B002TOJOY8,"""Is that gal gonna be high maintenance?"" This seemed to be a key question posed by the fellows in a lively barbershop when comedian Chris Rock (""Everybody Hates Chris"") asked them for some candid observations about dating black women. They all agreed that their sex lives have been sorely impacted by the ""Hands Off!"" aspect of dating a woman with a weave; one went so far as to name the actual date (in 1987!) when he last had a worry-free date.

The jaw-dropping particulars I learned about what constitutes ""Good Hair"" and what it costs in time, money and social dues was only part of this entertaining and insightful documentary. For example, most of the hair used in weaves is from India. On average, each Indian woman has her head shaved three times in her lifetime. One ""religion"" encourages people to bargain their hair against some aspect of their lives. If things work out for them, they go to a ""Tonsure"" temple and pay off their debt with their hair! These temples, in turn, sell the hair to Europe and the United States. Revenues for that religion are second only to those of the Vatican!

There is never a moment when Chris Rock isn't engaged, curious and wryly entertaining. We are as incredulous as he when we learn of the billions of dollars spent each year on hair and hair products. He represents all of us as he reels from information about the toxic chemicals used by black people to ""relax"" their hair (some are toddlers of FOUR). He questions the economics of a $1,000+ hairdo when the rent is past due. He laughs at the absurdity of black hair being ""Bad Hair,"" but acknowledges the power of marketing and peer pressure.

We were with him 100 percent when he went home to his two darling girls and kissed what he called, their ""nappy little heads."" He reassured them that he loved what was inside their heads and didn't really care what was on the outside.

I am encouraged to see clear-eyed and entertaining documentaries that question what constitutes ""Beauty."" Kudos to fellows like Chris Rock and Darryl Roberts (""America The Beautiful"") who care enough to see the problems (please see the alphabetized link on my JayFlix.net Home Page) and who try to shine some light on them.",1425513600,,2205,4.675257731958763

3985319,5,B002TOJOY8,"Fascinating and informative.  Chris Rock is, as always, wonderful, and I especially loved see the interview with Maya Angelou!  The scene where Rock is trying to sell an Afro wig to a Korean wig buyer is priceless. I kinda felt guilty laughing, but I'm certain it was meant to be comedy. Prior to this film I knew nothing about the hair black market in India, so this opened my eyes to yet another form of greedy exploitation.  I'd heard of the legendary Bronner Bros. show, and it was fun to be able to see some of the craziness. Also, it was delightful to see Chris Rock with his precious daughters. Even women who are all too familiar with the culture of black hair will learn and probably be shocked when Chris Rock interviews the Chinese and Korean beauty shop suppliers, and visits the sweatshops in India.

The documentary deliberately focuses on black women because it's made by a black guy who has a black grandma, a black mama, a black wife, and black daughters.

For me, one of the things that contributes most to the comedy parts of the documentary, is that none of the people in the film are playing characters that are supposed to be ""stereotypes""; they are all just being themselves. One reviewer here named specific stereotypes and I laughed so hard. That ""down white hair dresser"" is the elite Atlanta stylist, Jason Griggers, and the ""gay flamoyant"" guy is celebrity hairstylist Derek J (The Real Housewives of Atlanta), and he's basically an icon. The slick stylist doing deals with the giggly Indian hair smuggler selling human hair out of a suitcase, is Elgin Charles, who has a famous salon on Santa Monica Blvd. in Beverly Hills. (In real life, to his credit, he has relatively fair pricing within the wanton world of weaves).

I didn't think the scenes about relaxers were ""judgmental"" toward the women who make them, or even toward the manufacturers. Rock shows positives and negatives, I think. And I didn't feel people were being ""mocked"" as much as they were displayed for an audience through the eyes of a comedian. No, white women weren't mocked for having injected ""botox in their face and fat in their lips"",(as one reviewer wrote) but that scene where Griggers gets both is absolutely making fun of the bizarre white guy having the procedures done...when Griggers says ""Right now I'm not feeling as beautiful as I expected to feel""...It's impossible not to laugh.

One thing that I found that was not funny, but upsetting, was showing the everyday, hard working women paying steep sums for hair that might have been literally stolen off the heads of some Indian women. I think this is the most important part of the film. It seems incredibly off-balance that the women in India are  ""sacrificing"" their hair, only to have it taken and sold for sums of which they can't even conceive.  Their temple is as rich as the Vatican?  Because of selling human hair? I would love to know what this temple gives back to the population that is its goldmine hair-farm. It sure doesn't look like much.

I think Rock was being responsible by showing concern at the age of the children getting the ""creamy crack"" treatment, and he was obviously appalled when he saw the Indian baby getting her tiny head forcibly shaved so somebody could make a wig.

Rather than judge or mock I think Chris is urging people to think about what they do to themselves, and why they do it. I think he cares about his audience, and he wants us to know, for example, that sodium hydroxide can be nasty stuff if it's used the wrong way or in excess amounts. He wants people to examine the reasons for burned scalps, hair loss, singed skin, and even baldness, or for paying thousands of dollars for hair that's manually had bugs pulled out of it in Indian slums, to determine whethor or not they are programmed responses that might be outdated.

I agree that it's a shame the Natural Movement was not highlighted more, not only because showing natural hair helps little black girls to see how beautiful it is, but also because it would have been excellent marketing for incredible companies like Kinky Curly, Curl Junkie, Oyin Handmade, Camille Rose, Wonder Curls, and so many others that are being built in response to the needs of the community.

The scenes with Maya Angelou are treasures, and her perplexity over hair styling methods was both adorable and inspiring. Over all, even if Chris Rock did not seem to be supporting black women's choices for their hair, Rev. Al Sharpton expelled any such thoughts that might arise in the minds of viewers when he proclaimed the African-ness of both relaxers and 'fros, as only he can do... After he finished, I swear I heard a loud, communal Amen, in my head.

3985330,3,B002TOJOY8,"I am really struggling with this movie.  It's entertaining and funny, but so many blanket statements made.  ""Black women don't like their hair touched during sex""-ORLY?????  ""Black women don't swim""  ORLY????  Even reading these comments, ""WOW I had no idea black women went through so much!""  You still have no idea, this is not what ALL black women go through.  And it bugs me the judgement about women who wear relaxers, is there that same judgement about white women who change their hair texture or inject botox into their face and fat into their lips???  It also bothered me that he didn't even touch on the natural hair industry, the products that are being made by black people such as Oyin, Carol's Daughter, et al, and the women who choose not to wear weaves or chemicals in their hair.

The entire hair industry thing is interesting, especially since a lot of the products reportedly made by black people are the things that damage our hair, keep us bald and damage our skin and self esteem.  Watching that woman perm her granddaughter's hair was heartbreaking, hearing the woman who is a school teacher spend $1000 on a weave was unreal, or the other woman who was spending a mortgage on someone else's hair and looked so unhealthy and could barely string together an educated sentence.

Could have done without the ridiculous hair show.  Stereotypes everywhere, the down white hairdresser, the gay flamboyant-UGH

One thing I am hoping to come out of this is the realization of how much money (black women especially) give to big business so they can look like the ideal woman.  And I do like the last thing Chris Rock said, how he will tell his daughters that all that matters is what's inside their heads and not what's on top.  YES",1405641600,5,1747,4.7006578947368425

One of the earliest documentaries,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nanook-of-the-North/dp/0878070249/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nanook of the North</a>, did this with respect to the Inuit people (entertainingly if not factually), and one of the first ""modern"" documentaries,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garlic-Is-As-Good-As-Ten-Mothers/dp/6302449332/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garlic Is As Good As Ten Mothers</a>, was a great introduction to the Gilroy Garlic Festival, that most people outside of Central California had probably never heard of.

""Good Hair"" is in the same category. As a white man, despite having dated many black women, I never lived with one, and had never really thought much about their hair. I guess I assumed that it just came out however it looked, automatically. This movie showed me that I had been a real ignoramus in this area. Rock talks to men, women, salon owners, manufacturers, and suppliers, all the way back to the women in India who sell their hair for this purpose. I was especially struck by one man who commented that he could tell when a woman was out of his financial league, just by her hair style.

This is up there with the best examples of the documentarian's art. After seeing it, I now notice more of one aspect of the world around me. I certainly have a better understanding of what some of the women I work with are going through.

Rock also shows himself to be an excellent documentarian, in that he integrates the different aspects of the hair industry seamlessly, and keeps the action moving. Also, even though he is on screen a lot, he stays out of his subjects' way, and doesn't inject much of his own views, other than a sense of wonder.

There are even celebrity interviews which make this more provocative.  He travels to India to witness a religious event where they get most of the extensions women buy.

3985368,5,B002TOJOY8,I originally bought it because I love Chris Rock - but it's much deeper than I expected.  The concept of pain for beauty has been around for a long time - but Chris Rock did an excellent job of keeping it entertaining as well as informative.

3985372,5,B002TOJOY8,"I learned a lot about a topic I knew nothing about-trends for black women hair styling.  If I had a critique, I would have liked to have heard more about women who choose natural styling-and how difficult that is.  I thought Chris Rock was very respectful and did a wonderful job interviewing.  He was not at all judge mental-just presented the facts and asked different people involved in the hair styling of black women's hair-black women, hair stylists, product manufacturers , people involved in the sale and purchase of weaves/human hair used for weaves.  He injected just the right amount of humor to make his points and keep it interesting.",1390694400,,647,4.8545454545454545

(Very funny) Anyway, they were discussing why Chris Rock did this documentary; his daughter questioned why she did not have ""good hair"".  Not being African-American I was not quite sure what was meant by that so I talked about it with my neighbour and she wanted to see it too. I was glad as she could explain more fully some things for me.  Chris Rock did a remarkable job of exploring the many facets of this beauty business and its cultural implications.",1388966400,2,534,4.541666666666667
3985380,4,B002TOJOY8,The reason I rated it at 4 stars is because it was a comedic documentary. .and it didn't have as serious as a tone that I thought it might.  But overall it was a great time watching it.,1388966400,,185,3.8684210526315788
3985381,4,B002TOJOY8,Saw this years ago and wanted my mother to see it.  It was an eye-opener and re-enforced my decision to go natural.  There is something tragic about listening to people reject themselves and subsequently judge others based on that self rejection.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to take a step back to notice the 'forest' and not just the 'trees'.,1388966400,2,353,4.661290322580645

3985396,4,B002TOJOY8,"Film interesting except Chris Rock appeared to have been living under a ""Rock"" his whole life. He didn't show me anything I didn't already know.

No idea how/why I've always known that ""good hair"" & being ""high yellow"" were/are considered positive attributes.  Too many movies - too much reading how our ""founding fathers"" owned mistresses fitting that description?

I'm white, but still have an understanding of some of the hoops women have to jump thru in this world.  True I don't have to concern myself w/hair, but we all are supposed to have a good figure.  You get to be curvy - I get to look like a little boy.

Makes me sad the human race has ""standards"" for beauty.

Read up on Thomas Jefferson & Sally

A little story of mine.  My best friend - we'd gone to high school together - was Mexican.  Never thought of her as being different from me.  She spoke Spanish once & I was way taken back.  Sounds ignorant, but never considered it.  Realized one day she only dated white men - no matter how cruel they treated her...",1383436800,,1029,4.467741935483871

3985398,5,B002TOJOY8,This documentary should be viewed by every woman of color that allowed society to give them a false sense that weave and chemically altered hair is what beauty is. No only is this false sense of beauty harmful to thier physical health but their mental as well. This documentary takes it a step further and examines their economic foolishness of $600 hair. It would be awesome if this money stayed in our community.,1382572800,2,414,4.684931506849315
3985399,1,B002TOJOY8,didn't realize an documentary instead of movie so gave 1 star! A lot of celebrities but not what expected disappointed of course when expecting a movie!!!,1382400000,,154,4.961538461538462
3985400,4,B002TOJOY8,"I learned a lot watching this documentary...a lot of (us) black women are brain-washed thinking we need to throw a chemical on our heads as soon as we feel our ROOTS coming in. Or that we need a chemical to look beautiful...I think it is all in our heads because I have natural hair and I work in a professional work setting and I do not get judged or treated differently... let me tell you ""they"" don't care...just don't over do it...

I couldn't believe the Indian Hair our sisters buy is sacrificed!!! or stolen!!! Know whats in your head!! It may be real but come on how can you live with that on your head?? I say love who you are and if you are discriminated at work, there's a chain of command for that...eeoc :)

Anyway loved the dvd... I learned a lot and even some hair stylists",1382313600,2,788,4.246666666666667

Despite using ""permastraight"" in my teen years to straighten my ""white"" frizz, and the recollection of my best friend telling me in low tones ""it's what the black people use,"" I learned much.  I believe this is an important understanding because until one walks in another's shoes, one will never fully understand , or have sufficient understanding to respect the other.",1381968000,,537,5.022471910112359

3985407,4,B002TOJOY8,"incredibly funny - I can say it's one film that changed my life. Who knew hair was such huge business?  No doubt Rock focuses on the African-American community, but what I hear is that a huge number of celeb women of all stripes spend their million son Good Hair.

3985409,4,B002TOJOY8,"I'm white. I think natural African hair can be beautiful, whether in a neat afro, or in braids or in locs. I liked this movie, although it was a bit depressing. The ladies with straightened hair telling their natural hair sporting colleague that they didn't think her hair was professional made me want to bang my head on my desk--the thing was, I thought her short natural 'fro' was more professional than their straightened hair which looked fake and artificial to me. I think a lot of white people first interact seriously with blacks in college, and a lot of college professors keep their hair natural. For that reason I think some of us associate natural black hair with educational attainment.

I wished this movie had shown more natural hair at the end and all the different options for it, and I wished they showed how beautiful it can be. Even a simple ponytail on a black woman can look like an elegant bun, depending on her hair type. Anyway, still good, and I would highly recommend it.",1377302400,2,998,4.606741573033708

Thank goodness I've graduated, I never have to touch relaxer again.... and according to this film, that is a very good thing.

3985438,5,B002TOJOY8,"Excellent movie, a must see. I recommend this movie, is not a comedy, is not a political inspired movie. Is a movie about common sense. Nice documentary !",1366675200,,154,4.535714285714286
3985439,4,B002TOJOY8,I gave this DVD as a gift to my friend who is African American. I had seen it and she wanted to see it because I told her the premise and that it was very very funny. After she saw it she told me she learned a lot from the DVD about her own hair. She told me she was interested in being a stylist which I had no idea about and she learned from this movie as well as it being very funny. I didn't anticipate that would be the case I just saw it as a very funny movie about African American woman and their hair.,1366588800,,510,3.7314814814814814
3985440,5,B002TOJOY8,Chris Rock is great in this dvd.  Not only is this dvd funny it is very educational.  you learn how and where hair is made into wigs and weaves.  Also you learn about relaxers.  Great dvd.  A must have for all hair dressers.  Quick shipment and packaging.  Seller is awesome!,1365811200,,275,4.38
3985441,5,B002TOJOY8,Chris Rock is hilarious in this documentary on the lengths black women go through with thier hair. He also delivers great information on the chemicals used and how blacks own very little of the industry.,1365811200,,203,4.828571428571428
3985442,5,B002TOJOY8,"As an African American woman who has just recently embraced her natural hair, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Some have charged that the film is exploitive of the issues surrounding Afro textured hair. Yet, I found Rock's attempt to understand and address his teary-eyed daughter's sorrow at not having ""good"" hair entertaining, informative, and endearing. There's a reason Chris Rock is my favorite theologian.",1365724800,3,412,5.453125

3985447,5,B002TOJOY8,"I am a Caucasian female with crazy curly frizzy hair aka ""bad hair"" so it was very interesting to see this movie about the pursuit of ""good hair"" and the lengths some women will go to get it. I have shed many tears, damaged my hair sometimes beyond repair, spent many many hours straightening and staying away from water of any kind, and constantly been pressured from many people to ""fix"" my hair so it would be ""normal"". I feel, just from what my African American friends say, and from watching this film, that it is a more difficult battle for women of color. But I understand completely with the point of views and pressures explained in the movie, although it was sad to see so much money, time, and self esteem, from us in pursuit of ""good hair"", be wasted to just be like models in magazines (I do love fashion magazines, by the way, they all look beautiful so I'm not trying to bash). I'm glad Chris Rock brought some of this to light, and it inspired me to love and embrace my crazy curls so I can truly be me!",1364428800,2,1019,4.284974093264249

3985451,3,B002TOJOY8,This Good hair DVD was very funny. I think Chris Rock did a good job in expalaining how black women feel and maintain their hair or should I say not their hair. I had no idea black women went to such lenght to have shall we say good hair. What an eye opener,1363132800,,257,3.8679245283018866

3985453,5,B002TOJOY8,This was funny and educational all in one.  A most see!!! Only Chris Rock could pull off a movie about African American hair.  It really made me question some of the products I use.  It was worth the purchase.,1361923200,,209,4.3076923076923075

I suppose I just don't understand the need to have someone else's HAIR sewn or (ew!) GLUED into and on my hair and scalp. Vanity has a tremendous price and I feel for the women that want a wig for hair loss caused by disease, but, healthy women who spend their last dime to put someone else's hair on themselves and forego feeding their family or paying a bill????

The length some persons would go, to wear someone else's hair, and not make use of their own repeatedly or just for fashion really reveals insecurities.

His travels to India, and exploration of the hair product and weave industry were excellent and informative.  I enjoyed the cameo interviews with Ice-T, and especially Maya Angelou, who's brief commentary stole the show.

While I generally liked the movie, the last comment left a really bad taste in my mouth.

An important contribution to the conversation about black hair culture's impact on black women.",1356048000,,536,5.126436781609195

3985496,3,B002TOJOY8,"As a white person, I found this film really informative and a window into a world I knew nothing about.  I was shocked at how caustic and toxic the sodium hydroxide is that's used to relax black hair.  The experiment with the chicken breast and soda can was alarming, to say the least.  It's easy for me to say because I don't have these hair issues, but HOW could anyone expose themselves and especially their tiny children to these dangerous chemicals over and over and over again across a lifetime?  My own hairdresser told me that cosmetologists have one of the highest rates of Alzheimer's disease because they inhale these dangerous fumes year after year.  What's it doing to the customer?!  It seems like weaving is the way to go, if you prefer the straight look but good Lord; it's like taking out a small mortgage just to pay for it.

I wanted to see interviews with women who had NATURAL hair.  There weren't any.  It seems strange to parade all these women with weaves and relaxed hair across the screen and not give equal time to the natural ladies.  The film showed us what's bad about relaxers and weaves but faild to show what's good about staying natural.

I also felt the film was too long.  It could easily have been shortened by 1/2 hour by eliminating all the unnecessary business about the hairstyling competition at the Atlanta hair show.  Who cares about that?  This dialogue is supposed to be about relaxed vs. natural hair.  I don't care who wins a hairstyling contest.  Those bits seemed tacked on to lengthen the film when all it did was cause those parts to drag.  It wasn't as good or as funny as I thought it would be coming from Chris Rock, but it's a solid B-.",1347580800,6,1692,4.495081967213115

3985499,5,B002TOJOY8,"Chris Rock is fantastic as the host and author of this documentary.  He does an excellent job showing all sides of the issue, and his research into the source of human hair used for weaves will certainly enlighten many.  It seems quite exploitative that the temple in India sells the hair with none of the money going to the poverty-stricken  people who supply the hair - really eye opening.  Before I saw this film, I would have assumed that women in India were able to sell their hair for profit, giving them a way to supplement their family income -- the involvement of the temple in selling the hair without their knowledge was a suprise.  The video also highlighted the artistry that goes into black hairstyles -- as well as the expense and time.  Really a fine film, would love to see more of Chris as a documentary host (PBS?) in the future, as well as comedic performances.",1345593600,3,881,4.544303797468355
3985500,5,B002TOJOY8,"In the past week, a 16-year-old African American became the 2012 Olympic women's all-around gymnastics champion.  This is an amazing feat for anyone, especially one so young. And while some of the press seemed to focus on her hair, how it should have been ""done"" before she went out to charm the world, her smile and the smiles of her teammates and little girls everywhere didn't really care.  So it was purely by chance I came across this wonderful film, which focused on an issue so many don't know about, or understand, or realize is so important.  Good Hair takes us around the world, from Atlanta, to Los Angeles, to India, and presents a humorous and very honest look at the attainment of a ""crowning glory"" - and complete with occasional agony - in the world of hair for many women.  Sprinkled with interviews by the likes of Ice-T, Maya Angelou, Raven-Simone, Nia Peebles, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and many others, Chris Rock explores a world of toxic chemicals concocted to create that ""ideal"" look, the racial economic chasm of who really is behind this multi-billion dollar industry, and the excitement of over the top and the over stylized ""do"" at a convention for champions of the black female hairstyling world. With the impetus of wanting to explain to his two young daughters what ""Good Hair"" really is, Mr. Rock has shown America a peek into a world where sacrifice in the name of ""Good Hair"" begins at tender young ages, and affects aspects of life from relationships to financial gains and losses.  So to all those who feel a 16-year-old should focus more on her hair...watch this and remember that sometimes there is more to life than that good hair.",1344038400,19,1667,4.714776632302406

3985503,2,B002TOJOY8,"This 'documentary' is a passable introduction to black hair culture, but I found it to have a quite biased and shallow take on what is actually a very deep and complex subject. Chris mainly concentrates on women (and men) who use relaxers and weaves, his commentary on these subjects is often derogatory in nature, and he barely -- if at all -- mentions the notable amount of black women who wear natural hair, braids, dreads, etc. resulting in a very narrow perspective. Rock blatantly ignores anyone who does not contribute to his thesis: Natural black hair is not considered 'good hair'. Minus one star.

There is also far too much (somewhat boring) footage of a hair show in Atlanta that very loosely relates to the documentary topic. Minus one star.

What really rubbed me the wrong way about ""Good Hair"" was that Rock makes no mention of the fact that MILLIONS of women of all races and income chemically alter and change their hair with dyes, irons, relaxers, straighteners,  blow-dryers, bleach, rollers, extensions, etc. It is simply part of being a modern woman. Rock chides black women for using ""dangerous"" chemicals to change their hair and ""look white"", when the truth is that most women use some type of hazardous tool to seriously alter their hair -- whether it be the hydrogen peroxide in bleach, 300 degree flat irons or a bit of hair relaxer. When used in a careful way these products can have stunning results. There is nothing wrong with using lab-tested chemicals with common sense and caution if that is a personal choice. Minus one star.

It is good to talk about these issues, and the documentary is worth a watch if it is a topic of personal interest, but take it with a grain of salt. I kept hoping Chris would show some more positive clips of people who loved and enjoyed their natural hair -- I never saw it.

Two stars for bigotry. If I showed this to a friend who knew nothing about black hair culture, they would leave with the wrong idea.",1342310400,8,1971,4.636103151862464

I rented this movie because my daughter is Hispanic/African American. Everyone LOVES her hair, except for her so I wanted her to see what other women go through to ""feel beautiful.""  We were both shocked at the amount of money women spend on hair treatments.  More shocking was how much damage the chemical in perm solution can cause.

I had heard this was a documentary with him talking to people about having black hair, the qualities of black hair.

Since it has Chris Rock in it, and since he produced it, I expected it to be funny. But it's completely straight. He's an excellent interviewer!

But... it is about hair. As in, hair salons. Hair styles. Hair fashion. My boys were looking at me like, you thought we'd like THIS on movie night?

There isn't anything wrong with it, but it wasn't terribly compelling in the first half hour, which is how long we watched it before turning it off, putting it back in the Netflix envelope, and turning on Comedy Central to watch Aziz Ansari's hilarious standup special.

Chris rock gets to the heart of hair. Specifically the hair of black women, and the products, and the high dollar industry behind the do's. Exposed in creative and entertaining Chris Rock style humor,  the topic itself isn't all that amusing. Kind of horrifying actually. Rock participates in this documentary because he has two little girls of his own. His focus is on them and how societal pressure is going to affect them as they grow into awareness of what constitutes good or bad hair. Rock explores chemical relaxation, weaves, and natural hair, past and present. I did not know where weave hair comes from and was shocked at what Chris discovered. I shared the horror of the scientist who met with Chris to discuss the main ingredient in chemical relaxers. I believe the scientist's comment was along the lines of ""Why would anyone put that in their hair?"" I also stared wide-eyed at the annual hair product convention and the contest.

Whew. As a white girl I am never going to complain about a bad hair day again, seriously. If you are looking for an entertaining documentary, this one fits the bill.

3985514,5,B002TOJOY8,"Speaking as someone who grew up around people from many different backgrounds, and being born in the early 1980s, I saw all kinds of hairstyles and fashions come and go. I remember, distinctly, looking at some of the pretty, young girls in my classes and on the school bus, who had beaded braids, cornrows and slightly combed out afros. Since I didn't have that texture of hair, I honestly couldn't relate to stories of hair being processed, braided out or woven with tracks, extensions and wigs.

Chris Rock takes a look at the industry, culture, criticism and, ultimately, the danger of processing ""good hair"" (AKA hair inspired by Asian and European hair texture). We see that the main ingredient in hair relaxers (ammonium thioglycolate) has enough concentrated poison to cause permanent lung damage and melt a soda can (first, turning it to a translucent shade, then, transparent and finally, melting it). Plus, we travel with him to hair salons and barber shops, as he speaks to hairdressers and barbers, and hop on an airplane to India, to find out the route/roots of the industry. Much of the hair we see, that is created into wigs, weaves, and track pieces comes from Asia - specifically, India. In India, young and old women, alike, have their heads ceremonially shaved, at least twice in their lifetimes, give it as a sacrifice, never seeing a penny of the proceeds that hair dealers take to collect thousands of dollars, back in the United States. Without giving away too many subplots or spoilers, we also catch a glimpse of a national hair show that takes place, annually, in Atlanta, Georgia - where hair experts come from various cities to compete against each other, like athletes, in a series of presentations of supermodel proportions - costumes, themes, etc.

Chris Rock's humor comes fast and furiously, his interviews with celebrities like Ice T, Nina Long, and Sarah Jones, are engaging and insightful - as folks recount straightening stories, in their youth. We also learn the challenges of hair - especially, when it comes to social situations and dating. This is a great introduction to a culture I really didn't have much knowledge of.

I'm from the south so maybe that's why the stereotypes made me laugh and think ""wow that's true"" instead of cringe but it was a good movie. Several topics should have been talked about deeper and not just touched on but Chris did have a point to make and he made it. Although a lot of people say this movie offended them and it shouldn't have been made, I don't think it was made for the well informed. I think this movie was made to tell others the lengths that black women go through in order to ""tame"" their hair. It's about the money spent, the time taken, and the hoops that black women make themselves and their children go through in order to achieve the unachieveable perfection and win the battle with their hair. The movie does go a little deeper towards the ""weave"" section in detailing where 100% Indian hair comes from (some of it of course, probably not all of it) and it made a friend of mine who was thinking about getting said hair think twice and reevaluate her decision.

Albeit the language and sometimes grude humor it was a great film and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about the black hair care industry.,1311206400,,394,4.8088235294117645
3985524,5,B002TOJOY8,"Although so many people have written about this very interesting and often amusing documentary, I just had to write a review of my own to let you know my thoughts about it. First off, I am embarrassed to admit that I was unaware that black women put themselves through so much inconvenience, expense and even physical pain to have ""good hair,"" which, in essence, means losing the ""Afro"" look to have hair like a white woman's so they can get jobs and be more accepted. I was amazed to discover that in the African-American community many women and even some men pay thousands and thousands of dollars to purchase--sometimes on lay-away plans--hair extensions attached onto their shortened natural hair often using clips or get perms and other hair styles that use sodium hydroxide which can easily burn the skin on their heads and cause them great physical pain indeed. To demonstrate just how dangerous sodium hydroxide truly is, Chris Rock, the host of this documentary, examines the effects of sodium hydroxide on aluminum cans--after just a few hours of being dipped into a vial of sodium hydroxide the can is almost entirely disintegrated--and sodium hydroxide is what many black women and some black men put into their hair to make it wavy, straighter, ""whiter,"" or anything unlike the ""Afro"" look.

The film begins with Chris Rock telling us how surprised he was when his very young daughter walked into their home and asked him why she didn't have ""good hair."" Although he clearly sends the right message (he narrates as well as interviews) that what's in a person's head is more important than their hair, the film examines this issue well beyond this one statement.

There are two particularly interesting segments in this documentary that are well worth mentioning. Chris Rock visited the Bronner Brothers Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia to see the multi-billion dollar industry that has been created because so many African-American women want to have hair like Farah Fawcett. Many of the companies who present their hair products at the show were started by black people but have been bought up by Asians. There is also footage from a hair competition in which hairdressers have to put on an elaborate display involving creativity and originality to demonstrate that they really and truly know how to make a black woman's hair look anything but natural. There's a lot to laugh at here and indeed all through the film; but the unfortunate message that black women don't feel good about their natural appearance comes through loud and clear. There is great pressure on them to have hair that is straight or wavy--and they don't want their men touching their hair, not even during intimate moments!

Chris Rock also travelled to India for another segment of this film. I learned how women in India consider hair to be ""a vanity;"" and so they have their heads shaved during a religious ritual called ""tonsure."" The hair is then processed and sent to countries like America--where it is sold at high prices to women and sometimes men in either beauty parlors or barber shops. There is good interview footage with Chris Rock interviewing an Indian man who owns a company there that processes human hair for export. Indeed, India's biggest export is human hair!

Other interesting interviews Chris Rock has are with famous people including the great poet Maya Angelou; actress Kerry Washington; Reverend Al Sharpton; the rappers Salt-N-Pepa; Nia Long and more. Maya Angelou states that hair ""is a woman's glory;"" and apparently black women want the ""glory"" of the white woman's hair. Chris Rock also interviews everyday people for their thoughts on the subject; he talks with women in beauty parlors and men in barber shops and what they have to say about weaves, extensions and perms for black women or men are very interesting!

Overall, this documentary takes a most serious topic and uses some humor to make it enjoyable without heavy social commentary. The relative lack of social commentary may disappoint some people, but if you really look and listen to all those interviews there's more social commentary than what initially meets the eye. I hope the day will come when black women don't feel such pressure to have hair like a white woman's hair--they should be proud of their natural beauty and heritage. I recommend this documentary for anyone interested in African-American culture; and it's a real eye-opener for white people like me who were previously unaware of the scope of this issue.",1306108800,3,4506,4.955026455026455

Black women endure the potential of physical injury from the chemicals used to straighten their hair, hours upon hours of treatment in order to achieve the precise look they desire, and costs well into the thousands--yes thousands--of dollars to purchase a weave.

3985539,3,B002TOJOY8,"I think Chris Rock was ingenious to do this documentary and it was well done.

It seems like half the movie was devoted to the professional hair competition.  The whole hair industry has professional hair competitions and the hair can get pretty wild .  Albeit that the Bronner black hair competition Chris covered seemed beyond wild .  But I felt that the movie would have been more interesting if they had concentrated more on everyday women and everyday hair struggles.

the movie shows how much black women suffer to get ""good hair"" and how difficult it is to live with the various weaves etc.... and the huge financial investments women make to look pretty.

There is some discussion about why black women want to have straight hair and why they aren't happy with their natural hair.... it made me wonder if  a black woman can get a date with a black man if she doesnt straighten her hair ?  Are the women with the chemical treatments considered more beautiful by black men than women with natural hair ?

Chris Rock could have included even more about ALL women and what we go through for beautiful hair -- my blonde girlfriends pay $400 for their highlights, white women undergo all sorts of  hair straightening too ( Chelsea Clinton, Nicole Kidman for example), brazillian keratin defrizzing treatment is $400 ...fighting with our hair never ends!  Why cant what God gave us be considered good enough ?

3985541,5,B002TOJOY8,"Comedian Chris Rock keeps his comedy low key for most of this documentary, playing the interested interviewer, listening more than talking. He mentions his two young daughters who still have natural hairstyles, but are beginning to notice that smooth straight hair is the ideal. Rock acknowledges that they will feel pressure to relax their hair and while he doesn't seem too crazy about it, he realizes it's only a matter of time.

But now he's curious. Why is straight hair ""good"" hair? What's involved in straightening hair? Are there alternatives?

To find out, he goes to the major black hair care product convention, which takes place twice a year in Atlanta. He finds that black hair is big business, controlled mainly by major corporations such as Revlon, but there are also some smaller companies, some black-owned, most not.

The most revealing bit of information is that the vast amount of hair that is used for hair weaves, another popular method of getting straight hair, comes from India. While in India, Rock learns from one hair dealer that the hair is so valuable that Indian women are at risk of having their long hair snipped off in dark movie theaters.

It would have been interesting to find out a little more of the history of black hair styles, to find out when it became practically mandatory for black women to straighten. There's a poignant interview in which a group of high school girls, all but one with straightened hair, talk about the necessity of having smooth hair for getting a job. The girls acknowledge the cuteness of the one girl's natural style, then declare that they would never hire someone who had such an unprofessional look, such a disregard for her own appearance.

Too much time was devoted to the competition at the hair convention, which is a staged extravaganza with dancing and costumes and very little hair styling, oddly enough.

Good Hair is a thoughtful and entertaining documentary, which is about black hair, but could easily apply to the lengths many women (and increasingly, men) of all ethnicities go to to look good. Many of us spend more time and money than we can afford on beauty regimens. We apply dangerous chemicals to our bodies in the pursuit of beauty.

3985547,5,B002TOJOY8,"Having no sisters and being a white guy who grew up in an all-white town, when it comes to African American women and how much their hair means to them, my experience brings up the rear.

The first notion of how American black women may value appearance more than other females in the U.S.A. came to me when I saw the Spike Lee 1980s movie SCHOOL DAZE, where African American college girls with permanents belittle fellow sisters who leave their hair natural, derisively referring to the curly locks as ""nappy.""  Two decades later, actor Chris Rock's documentary GOOD HAIR straightens out the rest of it for me.

His pre-school daughter's interest in what she calls ""good hair"" - as opposed to what naturally grows on her head - starts Chris Rock's journey into dangerous hair-straightening chemicals and expensive hair weaves.  GOOD HAIR features Rock's interviews with black women and men, famous and unknown, explaining their need to avoid the naturally curly look.  News to this white guy is the celebrity status of black hair designers and a hair convention where stylists compete for prizes using elaborately staged demonstrations, including choreography that matters as much as the haircut.

How far do African American women go for straight hair?  To India, where Chris Rock watches as Indian people cut off their hair for religious purposes and Americans import it, because those straight locks become weaves religiously worn by black women.

See GOOD HAIR.  Being African American, of course Chris Rock grew up knowing how much it means for black women to uncurl their tresses and add to it with straight hair they didn't grow themselves.  But having daughters bumps his interest from passive to active, and the result is this engrossing and often funny (well, it's Chris Rock hosting) documentary.  I have a daughter, too, and worry her emphasis on appearance could cross from healthy to obsessive.  Chris Rock holds back from saying the words, but if the women we see in GOOD HAIR aren't in the latter category, it's only by a hair.",1273363200,13,2044,4.944444444444445

However, the Atlanta Hair Show segment was a bit out of place; it could've been its own movie (if it already hasn't been done).  There have not been many movies that I've fallen asleep on, but this was one of them.  I would not recommend this as a Netflix rental, because you'd waste the time in shipping before your next title.

I for one wish that more time would have been spent on mens hair styles; specifically balding and combating razor bumps.  But hey, I knew going in that the movie was geared to ladies and their crowns.

Black businesses did have a stronger presence  (we are told), but they  SOLD OUT to white-owned Revlon and Asian-owned businesses.
The fact that black entrepreneurs made (in some cases) fortunes in selling is ignored, and the fact that white-owned businesses have established a dominant presence is seen as OPPRESSIVE and RACIST. This absurd logic is pandered as intelligent observation (?)

Chris just eats it up, and that kind of stupidity and race-baiting is a sorry and bitter backdrop to an otherwise interesting piece of modern Americana.",1270771200,,792,5.32
3985551,4,B002TOJOY8,"ORIGINAL REVIEW April 9 2010: Chris Rock took an ordinary subject and brought it to life.  You have to give him credit for the work and research he did.  It will no doubt cause me to look at an African-American woman's hair different.  Chris keeps the subject alive by examining alarming truths about the issue.  I would have to agree with another review regarding content.  It didn't have as much comedy as expected.  Some may find the information demeaning, especially those who are intimate with the subject.  If you already know about weaves and relaxers please acknowledge Chris' efforts to bring awareness to some of the more painful points of the topic.
UPDATE June 28 2010: it's been three months since I watched this movie and I still look at an African lady's hair differently.  I'm always wondering how much they paid for the doo. LOL",1270771200,,845,4.739726027397261
3985552,5,B002TOJOY8,"Chris Rock is brilliant!  He lured me into buying Good Hair because he said he wanted to do something for Black people and I think he said he wanted to do something funny.  At least I assumed it would be funny because Chris Rock is a comedian.  Good Hair is a documentary on the absolute dangers of long-term use of perms.  He also makes it very clear that Black people have been brainwashed to believe our hair is ""bad.""  It's one thing for others to believe that but woefully sad when we believe it and try to appear as others!  He points out the inordinate amount of money women are willing to pay to change their ""natural"" look.  Finally, Rock shows that it is especially sad to get kids started with so-called kiddy perms.  Good Hair is a brilliant work!",1269907200,,759,4.371428571428571
3985553,3,B002TOJOY8,"A daughter inquires of her father ""why don't I have good hair?"" The father cannot believe what he has heard and sets out to get some answers of his own. What he encounters is surprising, outrageous and fascinating.

He travels from Los Angeles to New York to Atlanta and India to find out why black culture deems European and Asian style hair to be more desirable than any other. Along the way he uncovers the purported reason's and issues that drive this belief. Our father gets to the truth through a series of 'stranger than fiction' observations and inquisitive humor, that only Chris Rock can masterfully employ.

Along the way we pass through an intricate world of weaves, religious sacrifice and competitive fires on par with prize fighting. It's a nine billion dollar annual business, that is only marginally controlled by the community it serves. Yet, it is also a profession that enables it's hard working professionals throughout the US to live the American dream.

Throughout the film, Mr. Rock virtually leaves no stone unturned to understand why his daughter should have to question her own head of hair. There are many explanations and justifications that are both zany and sad, but it all comes down to each individuals interpretation of what constitutes beauty.

My money is on the great Paul Mooney, who splashed a bit of humor on his sad but true realization:

""If your hair's relaxed, white people are relaxed -
If your hair is nappy,they're not happy.""",1269820800,,1473,4.876
3985554,4,B002TOJOY8,"Wow, I'll never look at black women's hair the same way again!  For that matter, I guess I never really looked at their hair in the first place until I saw this movie.  Now I'm noticing it acutely, and I feel like a veil has been lifted.  That's largely because, in this documentary expos, Chris Rock nicely balances seriousness and humor to reveal the lengths American black women go to in order to straighten their hair with relaxers and augment it with weaves.

The result is hair which emulates that of white women, and the underlying motive, whether conscious or not, may be a desire for status.  While that may sound like a stretch, it's consistent with the observation that lighter skin color currently has higher status in just about all societies around the world.  But, regardless, the bottom line is that these kinds of hair modifications are currently the norm among American black women, with ""natural"" hair thus being the exception.

I understand that some black women are angry that Chris Rock made this movie, and I can appreciate that feeling.  After all, if they're trying to look good according to current fashion norms, they don't need people focusing on how they achieved that result and thus undermining the whole effect.  But on the other hand, it's also important to know that a large category of people feel pressured to alter their appearance, arguably somewhat radically, rather than being able to be comfortable with their natural appearance.  Moreover, I don't think that this movie degrades black women or diminishes their percieved beauty.  On the contrary, I'm personally finding my appreciation for the beauty of black women to be enhanced, regardless of what they do (or don't do) to their hair.  Maybe it has something to do with becoming aware of the care that black women give to their appearance, and thereby becoming appreciative of that?

In any case, I found this movie to be both entertaining and very eye-opening, and I recommend it to people interested in discovering a facet of American culture which they may have previously been totally oblivious to (like me).",1269561600,4,2107,4.901408450704225

3985556,2,B002TOJOY8,"Very disappointed with this movie and the way Chris Rock handled the topic. I won't get into all the reasons why this movie nauseated me, (thank God I didn't pay to see it). Anyway, as an African American woman, I found this movie degrading, and even racist. African American women are not the only women that do things to enhance or change their physical appearance. In particular, many Caucasian American women wear extensions (weave), all the time, and also dye their hair blonde and dye their children's hair blonde (similar to chemical relaxing treatments that African American, Asian, and Latina women use to straighten their hair). I just felt as if the movie was attacking and belittling African American women, had no educational value, and to top it off wasn't even funny. It shouldn't even be classified as a documentary, because that is not what this film is, and I was personally offended by it.",1269043200,8,908,4.864516129032258

3985558,3,B002TOJOY8,"Though I have never been a condious racist, the review cannot be made without some seemly racist remarks being included.  To those who are offended by what follows, I apologize.

Every white person should watch this movie.  Like me, they may find it devoid of humor, but fascinating as a window on the existance of a world that otherwise would remain hidden from them.  After watching this movie I was dumbfounded.  The existance of an almost universal commitment by American black women for a major portion of their disposable income and time (no matter their social-economic strata) is exposed in detail that will add to underscoring the differences that exist below the surface that are accepted/tollerated by most black women.  When I look at a black woman's hair how, I appreciate all she does and the commitment they make to fashion.  When the movie was over, slackjawed, I said, ""I never knew that.""  I now actively observe a black women's hair when I see her as I tended to pretty much ignore it all my life before.  I feel that I how have another window into trying to understand that there exist differences that are totally invisable but still affect people.

While the lack of ""funny"" disappointed me as a Chris Rock fan, I am glad to have seen this movie. It took me to somewhere I was unlikely to go otherwise and taught me about people who impact on my life and helped me to be more empathetic and understanding.",1268438400,7,1427,4.649402390438247
3985559,4,B002TOJOY8,"Chris Rock does a great job of narrating this light-hearted documentary on the topic of black women's hair and the efforts to style it.  As a white male, I really had no idea about this subject.  The most shocking revelations are that black women pay upwards of $1,000 to get a weave!  Also, this is portrayed as fairly common and done by women of all income levels.  The fact that the hair is REAL human hair taken from Indian people who shave it off in a religious rite is even more astonishing.

The black hair industry appears to be very lucrative.  Yet, the chemicals used to ""relax"" the hair are shown as dangerous to the skin and can even cause serious health issues.

Chris Rock keeps probing at the issues and points out that all of the effort is because black women perceive straight, relaxed hair as ""good.""  Nature black hair that is not straightened or relaxed is ""bad.""

At a minimum, I think most people will learn a few things from the documentary and enjoy the comedic aspects of the film.",1267747200,4,1006,4.483516483516484

3985561,5,B002TOJOY8,"I've been attending Sundance since 1990. Living in Salt Lake and having this festival right in my backyard ( Park City ) is a blessing beyond any and all. If you love film, Sundance is Heaven.
Being a cinephile ( and sometimes actor ), I do my best to attend at least 18-20 screenings each year ( often up to 25 plus panels and all the incredible music at the ASCAP music cafe, etc, etc...) That being said, each year I pick a film or two that I feel my wife will enjoy and we can attend together. She's not quite the hardcore I am and a couple of films a year is about her `quota'. In '09 ( 2010 being this past festival ) that film was ""Good Hair"". We saw it at a screening in Salt Lake - I rarely come down from Park City for SLC screenings for fear the director won't consider the screening ""important"" enough to merit a Q & A, One of the main reasons Sundance is so wonderful, is this rare chance to interact with the filmmakers - The venue was The Rose Wagner Theater, a wonderful 'legit' theatrical performance house w/ full stage, and beautiful ""ambience"".
I know that I've already rambled on and on and haven't even mentioned the film, but the reason will become apparent shortly ( we all hope...).
The film was all I'd hoped it would be. The documentary section of the Festival has always been the strongest ( in both my own and founder Robert Redfords opinion ), and Good Hair was true to form. The catalyst for the story, Rock's daughters question about why she doesn't have ""...good hair..."" sets Rock on a journey across America, that includes a number of mostly interesting and humorous interviews ( I'm sure Rock called in a lot of favors to get some of the names and personalities who open up and tell us their ""hair"" stories ), as well as background and some historical context. I don't think Rock was out to make a dead serious, socio-anthropologic, academic study of Black people in America ( though, in some part he succeeds to this end anyway, though more inadvertently than purposefully ), I think his aim was more a semi-serious, semi funny 'chin scratching' rumination on something that had been going on around him most , if not all of his life, a big ""Hmmmmmmm?"" that his beautiful daughters questions had set off in head.
To this end we are treated to some hilarious stories about the nature of current black culture as it relates to the self image of black women in America, what they have to do to try and maintain that image, be it self imposed or imposed by the media and generations of brainwashing. Additionally we find out what black MEN think about when it comes to "" the black hair culture "". Making ""good hair"" ( for black women ) is EXPENSIVE and there is a lot of talk surrounding how black men are `forced' to support their women and their unfailing need to obtain and maintain "" Good Hair"". Especially entertaining is the "" Barbershop Men "". A hilarious peek in and conversation w/ da boys at the local barbershop, just too funny.
I was surprised when we were told to stick around for a Q & A with not only the director but with Chris Rock himself. I have to say after my many years attending Sundance Q & A's, Mr. Rock elevated this one to the top 5 of all time. He spent at least 45 minutes ( there was no screening following ""Hair. so we had as much time as Chris was willing to give ). Rock was very informative, gracious, both self effacing and totally confident, as well as pretty amazed that he was just about ""...the onliest black man in the building... "" which was almost the case ( a few then vocal 'bro's & sisters yelled and raised their hands, but... Salt Lake City is a pretty damn 'whitewashed"" town, to be sure. None the Less Rock regaled the appreciative audience at length, and fielded any question whether it regarded the film or not ( most did, to the audiences credit ). At turns sidesplittingly funny, appreciative and informative, Rock made a pretty damn good film screening into an unforgettable evening of film and fun. I only wish that their had been cameras to record the event and this was included in the DVD / Blu Ray extra's. This would have made the entire package even 'mo better. I wish everyone could have been there to see Chris Rock 'shine' in this special moment for a film made more special to me by Chris Rocks visit to Salt Lake CIty.
