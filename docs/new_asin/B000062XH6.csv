1685017,5,B000062XH6,"I think that this movie is 1 of the best movies I have ever seen. I went and rented the movie the day it came out and bought the DVD the following weekend. This movie has my favorite actress, Domonique Swain in it. I had been really anticipating for the release of this movie as well as other by her including ""Happy Campers"", ""The Smokers"", and ""New Best Friend."" Dominique and the rest of the cast are all tallented and hopefully she'll keep making movies that I enjoy like this 1.",1028592000,,483,4.318681318681318
1685018,4,B000062XH6,"THIS MOVIE SHOWS US A REALISTIC LOOK AT THE HATES OF SOCIETY AND WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR US TO FIT IN.
DOMINIQUE SWAIN PORTRAYS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS FILM WITH CHARM AND SOPHISTICATION. AS BEAUTIFUL AS I HAVE EVER SEEN HER, SHE SHINES IN THIS FILM.
THE SUBJECT MATTER IS GEARED TOWARDS TEENS, BUT IT HAS A POSITIVE MESSAGE BEHIND IT.  IT IS AS FOLLOWS:
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE TO REALIZE WHO OUR TRUE FRIENDS ARE.
I HOLD DOMINIQUE SWAIN IN HIGH REGARD AS MY FAVORITE ACTRESS AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN MOVIES TODAY!

1685019,1,B000062XH6,"The premise of the movie sounded pretty interesting. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I decided to give it a chance, even when it got boring. It's not that I have a problem with kids on drugs and having sex, it's that I have seen this movie before, and it's called ""Bully."" (Not only because of the repeated actors and actresses, Bijou Phillips and Brad Renfro, but because of the repeated subject matter) Plus, if that was the kind of movie it was going to be, that would have been fine, but it was almost as if it was trying to be deep with the internal monologue of the main character. Yuck. Be what you are. The writing was bad and completely unrealistic....
I just felt like the characters weren't developed enough, and if the scene actually started to produce something good, it never went anywhere. Blah. The End",1027641600,10,814,4.54421768707483

DRUGS, SEX, VIOLENCE, THESE DAYS THAT IS WHAT TEENS GROW UP IN.  IT'S SAD, BUT TRUE!  THIS MOVIE PORTRAYS SOMETHING THAT COULD VERY WELL HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. THE DRUG ADDICTION OF ALL THE TEENS IS WHAT GOT ME, I MEAN THIS MOVIE HIT IT RIGHT ON THE NAIL.  PARENTS JUST DON'T WANT TO FACE THE FACTS THAT DRUGS ARE ON THE RISE AND THIS IS VERY MUCH AN ANIT-DRUG MOVIE.

1685021,1,B000062XH6,"The title of this review says it all.  I rented this because I picked up the wrong tape in the store and watched it because I had nothing else to do.  What a mistake!  The characters are simplistic, the plot twisted and confusing (but not in a cool way, more of a ""I don't know how to write a screenplay"" way), and the relationships nonsensical and unrealistic.  It was excruciatingly long, pretensious, and melodramatic.  The few funny moments are almost camp, and the acting is sub-par at best.  Please save yourself the money and avoid this movie like the plague.",1020902400,6,566,4.61
1685022,1,B000062XH6,"This movie was a waste of my time and money. Everyone hyped it up to be the next ""KIDS"" and it didn't even come close. Bijou Phillips appears in the movie for like a total of 10mins. Good performance from her though. I guess Renfro enjoys playing dopey roles. Mischa Barton was disappointing. She's a great actress but not in this film. Swain needs to get some good roles instead of playing love-sick girls who mope around all the time. The ending of the movie makes no sense and doesn't even fit the storyline. If you're looking for a similiar but better film, try the drama ""Kids"" or the comedy ""Coming Soon"".",1019606400,2,611,4.464285714285714
1685023,4,B000062XH6,"Tart is a film that deals with real teen issues: family, prejudice, first love, sex, drugs, sexual identity. It doesn't take the easy road but goes to some pretty dark places. The story unravels in an interesting way. It takes it's time and allows you to get to know the characters. The cinematography is beautiful and captures New York city at it's best. The performances are solid, especially Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips. It's for adults just as much as it's for teenagers. This is one teen film that won't insult your intelligence.",1019260800,3,537,4.78494623655914
1685024,4,B000062XH6,"Once again Dominique Swain graces herself in this strange film that revolves around snobby private school brats.  The movie is neither heavy nor deep, rather just a dark story well executed by most of the cast.  It is that rare film that starts at the end and slowly works its way back, and everything makes sense.  I guess this film is shocking, to American standards, it touches on some subjects the typical teen films have never approached-it is definitely not for the sheltered.  I enjoyed watching it and will undoubtedly watch it again.  The version I have is the one released in Hong Kong, hopefully the American release will have better features.  The film moves at a decent pace, never too slow nor too fast, and is overall entertaining.",1013990400,5,746,4.744186046511628

1685043,1,B000062XH6,"I really wanted to like this seeing as I like brad renfo I like mischa Barton and bijou Phillips. But the acting was bad excpecislly mischa. This movie looked like they filmed it for maybe 500 dollars. The plot was stupid and random. If you want a teen drama movie watch 13 or lords of dogtown, havoc, bully, kids. Those are all good movies with kids doing drugs,having sex and partying. This movie was a jumbled mess. I honesty dot know why brad renfo always plays the drugged out loser and bijou is always the slutty girl who your suppose to feel sorry for?

1685071,2,B000062XH6,"In my opinion, The main reason for watching this is to see Lacy Chabert. She smoked in Mean Girls, which is what lead me to this Film. Seeing the Names Dominique Swain (Pumpkin and Lolita, of which I have seen both and own the latter) and Melanie Griffith made me think perhaps it would be a keeper, as it was compared to Mean Girls With Lindsay Lohan. In mean Girls, Lacy still delivers the punch and smokes Lindsay as for as 'hotness'.

But no the film was little more than a Reprisal of Lolita, with the poor parts of Mean Girls for a plot and not even the good Graces of or sweetness of Mean Girls. Of all the characters played, the only two who were not two dimensional like a cardboard silhouette script was Lacy and Melanie. Melanie did another 'alcoholic mother being abused by the family'. Dominique is her normal two dimensional self, sliding around moral points that should be shipwrecks, not flips of the pages on the script. In the end, you really don't feel sorry for anyone, at all.

But Lacy is smoking hot, and totally believable if a bit shallow, but still tries to do right, you get the happiness is real in her family. If you get it cheap enough, it might be worth a watching or two For Lacy, Best Viewed while making in another until Lacy shows up.",1330819200,,1269,4.372881355932203

1685075,2,B000062XH6,"The only reason I rented this to start with was on the count of Dominique Swain. I knew ahead of time about all the bad reviews & negative feedback, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway.

NO..It is definitely not even in the margin of the best 200 Films you've ever seen, but it isn't THAT horrible. I thought Swain did very well in it. All of her actions in the film seemed real and justified. I agree some parts throughout the core of the movie made no sense, and made you wonder ""Why was that even in there, or that doesn't even relate to anything in the story"". But, there were a couple of good moments...the beginning & the end. (You will understand what I mean, if you've watched this film). I won't give it more than 1 and a half stars/2 stars, but I won't say watching this was a complete waste.

(As for the other actors-Melanie Griffiths part was almost merely a cameo, Mischa Barton did Ok, Lacey Chabert was her usual self, and Bijou Phillips was fair...But this definitely was one of Brad Renfro's worst.)",1130889600,3,1019,4.329842931937173
1685076,2,B000062XH6,"""Tart"" is a good illustration of the old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"".  Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that never goes anywhere.  ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.

Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer.  Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of Swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of  the ""Alice in Wonderland"" sculpture.  The symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film.

It is even possible that Waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic ""Metropolitan"" and the camp classic ""Cruel Intentions"" both of which also dealt with the Manhattan upper class.  There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes.  The former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations.  ""Tart"" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction.  First there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased Swain into the garbage chute.  Then there is the whole bit about her father being Jewish (played to the same extreme as Joel Grey dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in ""Cabaret"").

In her other films Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears (insert scenery chewing here) but in ""Tart"" she actually shows an ability to restrain herself.  This is the best performance of her career.  It also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in ""Girl"" to hulking lumpy-faced in ""Pumpkin"".  This transformation was about half-complete by the time she made ""Tart""; so go the ravages of time.

Mischa Barton (""Sixth Sense's"" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles.  The rest of the cast is simply horrible, although some of the blame for this should go to Waye's script and direction.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1127088000,7,2558,4.976470588235294
1685077,4,B000062XH6,"Straight to the point. . . .there are a lot of mixed reviews here, but I would say that this movie is a really good film. Now, i'm in to the quirky, eye-catching, think you can't stomach what is going on with this film kinda movies that have young up and coming actors/actresses in it. Bijou Philips can always be spotted in most of the films, that's how you know it might fit the mold. Anyway, if you aren't into the crazy larry clark films such as ""Kids"" and ""Bully"", or any movies such as that, then this probably won't interest you a bit. Oh, and to that reviewer at the top. . . Megzi i believe their name was. . . .Mischa Barton who is great in the film, she doesn't throw on a fake english accent in the movie. . . she really is from London. . . do your research first!",1124755200,8,776,4.045454545454546
1685078,1,B000062XH6,"For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story.  I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal.  Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story.  I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me.  After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.  I just didn't care.  That is not a good sign.  The characters were bland.  When I say bland, I literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate.  The story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism.  Now, I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective.  The casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy.  You knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces.  These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne.

What immediately pulled me away from this story?  It was mainly the characters.  I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself.  Director Larry Clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character.  Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored.  I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why.  It was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive.  He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite.  Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown.  Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film.  While I am on the subject ... nobody showcased the best of their abilities.  What is going on with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost.  Rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act.  Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in.  Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.

My biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film.  Nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together.  There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed.  The robberies, the teenage ""angst and woe"", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random Kids in the Hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together.  With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape.  Family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers.  Wayne did not complete the task at hand.

While I hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film I am left with little choice.  With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any ""good"" behind Tart.  This was a film I had heard nothing about, and after viewing it I can see why.  All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart.  It is hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this film.  While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm.  While most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in Tart you can credit nothing.  From the opening sequence until the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal.  No consistency, no strength.

Overall, this film is a waste of your time.  If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film.  While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch.  It was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up.  Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life.  Avoid at all costs!

1685079,1,B000062XH6,"From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the ""fun, crazy"" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill. Stay away.",1123286400,,863,4.647058823529412
1685087,4,B000062XH6,"I bought this movie at a video store for $2.00 where they were giving away movies for free that didn't sell well. I had wanted to see this movie for a while but I never got around to it. Today I decided what the heck, I'll buy it, it was cheaper to buy it than it was to rent it. So anyway I was expecting a movie with a lot of sex, drugs, and an 'American Pie' type dialogue to boot. What I got was way different. There's hardly any sex (except for one scene from far away, where you can hardly see anything) and the movie was much more serious instead of cheesy (unlike the cover art leads you to believe). A lot have people have complained about a lack of a plot. The plot is there, it's just more drawn out. The movie was very realistic, basically it could have been a biography of any teenage girl's life. It doesn't end happily like most teen movies end, in fact it ends kinda sad but yet in the same sense it says, ""life goes on keep plugging at it"". I thought it was something any teenage girl could relate to. There aren't a lot of big stars in this movie, the biggest star today would be Mischa Barton who puts on a fake English accent. Anyway, I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews. Yes, the cover art and the movie title makes the movie appear to be some kind of soft-core porno but it's completely different. So never judge a movie by its cover and give it a chance. It's more about relating to it, than being entertained.",1121299200,31,1446,4.167857142857143

I wish the concept was saved for good actors and a good script who could've made the movie really hit home.  It is a movie people can relate to, and it is good in a satirical sense - but if the creators were not trying to make a satire, wow it sucks more than i thought.
