7842780,5,6303183999,This movie was dope because my man Ron Brice stole the show....he actually can rap and the lyrics are hardcore just the way I like my HipHop...Real.  The other dude was cool....Fresh Prince like....cute....but Ron reminds me of a darker version of Rakim....the master.,1473033600,,268,5.090909090909091
7842781,4,6303183999,"Love this movie. Don't know why it isn't bigger. King is one of those rappers, seems a combination of LL Cool J, Will Smith and Flava Flav ... and I the dark brooding one, like nobody in the rap game. The combination of the two is exciting to watch. Try this.",1375660800,,259,4.098039215686274

7842783,5,6303183999,"its a great movie if you grew up in the ERA, it is what it is and ppl are expecting too much.",1166918400,,93,3.272727272727273
7842784,5,6303183999,"I fell in love with Ron Brice when I witness him play this role.

He has charisma just as he does in his' other roles. ''I realize that certain viewers don't own the depth to appreciate this film,simply because they can't relate''! Reality isn't always pretty, it has a Grotesque side as well! A Synopsis of this film is simply about a college student who uses RAP as a pawn in order to exscape true responsibility! As a result he falls in the path of a Die Hard Rapper/drug-addict...Rich is caught up in the Hype of what he thinks RAP can bring. What Rich finds out is that ''all that glitters isn't gold''.",1116806400,2,608,4.380530973451328
7842785,2,6303183999,it doesn't know weather it want's to make rap out to be a useless outlet or praise it.plus the idea of a record ceo being right about the arguement he had with the rappers was laughable.maybe they was trying to be un biased buy telling his side of the story.but it camed off as a anti rap movie.oh and lets not start on the suburban middle aged white women who said there music was garbage?.and then offered them coffee.like she gives a [darn] about them making good or bad quality rap.,1015632000,2,486,4.351648351648351
