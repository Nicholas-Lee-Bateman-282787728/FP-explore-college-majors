7154544,5,B00WUKI0NW,"The best reason to watch this version is to see the marvelous principals, Natalia Osipova and Matthew Golding. Their technical perfection and dramatic energy truly dazzle. No problem there. What about the rest? There have been many, many versions of Swan Lake and there really is no practical ""original"" Swan Lake so it is just a waste of time to wonder about it and, believe me, except for historical interest, you would not want to see the 1895 performance(as if you could go back in time); by today's standards, it would be laughable. This version is set in the time of Tchaikovsky, the late nineteenth century, which automatically makes it one of the more unusual versions. But that setting is fine with me.  As a result, though, there was a very crazy costume choice. In the third act, the first dance is the dance of the six princesses. They wear traditional dresses with bustles. Bustles are fine for social dancing but if you are going to go full out ballet, you don't want to wear a bustle. The sight of six dancers jumping high with bustles banging in the rear is one of the most bizarre sights I have ever seen in classical ballet! I don't blame the dancers, they pulled it off wonderfully, I blame Yolanda Sonnabend, the ballet's designer. I could also nitpick the fact that the dance of the four signets could have been more precise. But I won't nitpick. I should also add that the entire cast really danced well. It is not my favorite version; for example, one of my favorite ballet moments in all ballet, the Swan Lake solo male adagio, is left out. There is also nothing terribly noteworthy here(other than the great principals), no dancing by Rothbart, no unusual solo inclusions. I also didn't like the fact that the hunting party, especially Benno, was too involved with the swans at the beginning act two. Benno even moves among them as they take their positions. This takes away some of the mystery. Benno should have suspicions but no direct knowledge, although this does vary among various stagings. I could have deducted a star or two, but I felt this was still a great staging and worth watching. So, for those who have seen most every Swan Lake version, this one is worth it for the principals, and for those new to the ballet, you will enjoy this and won't be bothered by the stuff that bothers us old hands! There are also some nice interviews and rehearsal scenes as special features.",1436486400,8,2413,4.63785046728972
7154545,4,B00WUKI0NW,"A fine DVD of a lovely performance of SWAN LAKE, originally aired 'live in cinemas' in March 2015. The short and uncurvy Natalia Osipova may not be the most poetic Swan Queen Odette but she dazzles with her 32 fouetts and brilliant double attitude turns as the Black Swan Odile. As the Prince, Matthew Golding is a fine partner and powerful soloist, is somewhat hammy in his acting. Those who saw the live cinemascast will notice that the solos of the two Act 2 Pas de Trois ladies have been redone, to fix noticeable errors; they now dance perfectly! Special kudos to Laura Morera and Ricardo Cervera is Ashton's Neapolitan Dance in the ballroom act. The corps de ballet of swans is exquisite, including the line of students as baby cygnets among the adult swans. This version is the closest one can see on DVD to the landmark 1895 St Petersburg version by Petipa & Ivanov, to Tchaikovsky's score as reworked by the Tsar 's conductor R. Drigo.",1435881600,13,944,4.625
7154546,5,B00WUKI0NW,"Words can't describe how impressive this performance is. The partnership between Matthew and Natalia is fantastic and fueled with so much passion. Their height and technique match very well. The orchestra play Tchaikovsky's music with energy and grace -- one of the best versions I've heard. The most amazing moments include the time between 00:49:00 and 1:08:00, and the black swan pas de deux, variations and coda in Act III -- lots of stunning jumps and fouettes!",1435795200,8,466,5.064935064935065
7154547,5,B00WUKI0NW,"Natalia Osipova is the greatest ballerina of our time.  Matthew Golding, not as well known, turns out to be a perfect Siegfried for her in this Royal Ballet production.  She is a deeply moving Odette, courageous yet vulnerable.  He is a truly noble dancer, supportive and appealing.  In the Black Swan pas de deux, she is brilliantly icy, saving her smiles for her evil father Rothbart, and Siegfried is the all-too-understandable victim.  Her brilliant 32 fouettes are much remarked upon; less immediately noticeable is her long unsupported attitude en pointe. Her acceptance of him in Act III after his betrayal is deeply moving, and on the whole this is the best Swan Lake to be seen in a very long time.",1435449600,2,707,4.809917355371901
7154548,5,B00WUKI0NW,"I was lucky enough to catch this production when it was first staged. Despite some minor changes, it remains a gold standard production in my view.

Utterly disagree with the reviewer (except the remark about Von Rothbart as the cuddly duck - he gets better treatment in the ABT's version!). To be fair, the RB's Swan Lake needs to be seen live (indeed I saw some of the very first performances way back when) and the whole production shines. Some of the look and feel of the thing doesn't transfer so well to DVD, it has to be said.

Russian productions leave me cold. No mime (the prince aimlessly swings Odette around). I think - if done well, the famous 'my mother cried a lake of tears' sequence is amongst the most moving moments in Act 2 - or of any ballet - and most ballerinas are denied the chance to do it justice (Osipova, to her credit, includes it in her interpretation - unlike Makarova when she danced with the RB years ago). I recall RB's Fiona Chadwick performing the mime so exquisitely - everyone remarked on it afterwards. The Russians, meantime, have denied generations of dancers this opportunity. Instead, we get dull, indifferent, blank-faced ballerinas (tall, skinny, cookie-cutter clones with little or no personality).

A scholar recently concluded that the RB's version is the closest to the 1895 version (despite some of the changes)  - NOT any of the Russian offerings - he'd obviously done his homework. Having watched the various productions, I would recommend RB or ABT versions.

Whatever your view, get it for Osipova (I recommend her Giselle, too). She is worth the price, alone.",1434844800,9,1616,4.777777777777778
7154549,3,B00WUKI0NW,"Anyone looking for the finest video of the world's favorite ballet will not find it in this second high definition release from the Royal Ballet - in spite of ballet superstars Natalia Osipova and Matthew Golding.

A perfect Swan Lake is not just dependent on the brilliance of the two principals.  The other soloists must be superb, the precision of the swan maidens flawless, then there are the sets, costumes and the lighting which play an important part.  However, a truly memorable Swan Lake will ultimately depend on the choreographer and the conductor.

Unlike other ballet scores including Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker, Tchaikovsky composed his first ballet in symphonic form, without the demands and dictates of any choreographer.  No ballet score has equaled it before or since: Boris Gruzin's conducting is solid, dependable, but when interpreted by Valerie Gergiev it is magic - as the introduction reaches its climax you feel chills running up your spine.

Swan Lake's first performance at the Bolshoi in 1877 was a failure.  A restructured version at the Mariinsky in 1895 was a rousing success and ever since, choreographers around the world have felt at liberty to add/adapt/change the original Petipa/Ivanov choreography as they have seen fit (although most retain well-known set pieces).  The current Mariinsky version is the one that has remained the most faithful to what is generally considered to be the standard version - it is very different from Ashton's emasculated offering preferred by Britain's Royal Ballet.

Act 1 in the Covent Garden production relies heavily on opulent costumes, mime and some pretty dancing.  In the Mariinsky version, within minutes of the curtain rising audiences are treated to some spectacular, virile dancing, the momentum never lagging throughout the scene.  In the next scene, by the lakeside, the London version is lovely.  The Saint Petersburg version is breathtaking.

The choreography is the major fault here.  In the accompanying interview, producer Anthony Dowell claims to have made the men appear more natural to avoid the ""cringe factor"" - the wife who drags her husband, screaming, to the ballet.  Those same husbands are going to run from this performance screaming ""Never again!""

Forty-nine minutes into the ballet the Prince, who has danced only once (briefly), lifts the crouching Swan Queen to begin the famous pas de deux - but has been reduced to little more than a prop.  Only in the third act audiences get a glimpse of Dowling's prowess.  In Russian and ABT productions Rothbart dances.  Here, smothered in a weird costume of feathers and furs, this piece of flummery merely mimes.  Instead of personifying evil, Rothbart comes across as a cuddly, fluffy duck.

Setting the ballet in 1895 Imperial Russia works well, the sets in Acts 1 and 3 sumptuous with a sensational conclusion to Act 3.  However, the sets are simply too dark and the lighting insufficient to show off the dancers.  Costumes are fabulous, but dressing male dancers in dark costumes against dark backgrounds is an unbelievable gaff.  When Golding makes his first appearance, it is usual for audiences to applaud an artist of his stature, instead he is treated to silence.  All that can be seen is an unrecognizable pale face and his hands.

Dark costumes and dark backgrounds mar Act 3: for the Czardas, purple and black costumes against a purple/black background, dark green and black outfits against a similar dark background in the Mazurka.  Except for some camera close-ups, most of the time only faces and hands can be seen.  And please, please, please, for the real wow factor bring back the original tutus for the swan maidens...

The pretty, effeminate British productions of such great classics as Bayadere and Swan Lake seem to be staged for women who don't approve of men and for men who are not attracted to women.  If the English experienced the Russian versions of these ballets they might realize what they have been missing and wives would not have to drag their husbands, screaming, to the ballet.

Disenchanted with the previous Royal Ballet offering of Swan Lake, I purchased this latest release solely because of Osipova.  As Odette/Odile she merits every superlative that has been lavished on her.  If Osipova returned to the Mariinsky (or the Bolshoi) we might at long last be rewarded with the perfect Swan Lake.",1434153600,18,4386,5.072524407252441

7154551,5,B00WUKI0NW,"I also have both recordings, this one and the one with Marianela Nunez, and I think they are both wonderful. But I agree with Energeticus, I also liked Marianela Nunez better, specially as Odile. She puts on a smile throughout her interpretation of Odile that is , not only seductive but rather malicious. Perfect!
As for that comment about Anglo-Saxon flair for dramatic interpretation, the fact is that there is nothing Anglo-Saxon about Ms. Nunez. She is not only Argentinian, but has a very Spanish last name, as well as a very Spanish first name.",1457654400,,551,4.810526315789474

7154554,5,B00WUKI0NW,"Got this for Christmas and I absolutely love it!

I'll start with the stars: Natalia Osipova as Odette/Odile is astounding and beautiful. The Bolshoi missed out when they didn't cast her in this role during her time with them. Her Odette is fragile, harrowing, and sublime, with beautiful lines and swan-like movement. Her Odile is wicked, playful, and sizzling - I liked her Black Swan just a tad bit more than her White Swan. Matthew Golding as Siegfried...I liked him in the role as the drama continued to unfold. His reaction about marriage to Elizabeth McGorian's Queen is wonderful, he truly seemed to be telling her, ""WHY must I get married, Mom? I'm not in love with anyone yet!"" He was clearly besotted by Osipova as the Black Swan and their pas de deux in Act 3 was gorgeous and dramatic. Gary Avis as Rothbart was outstanding and his acting sent chills down to my spine.

Elizabeth McGorian's Queen was regal and sublime; I could definitely see her different emotions as the ballet went on, from being disappointed at Siegfried for not wanting any of the princesses at the ball to her terror and misery at seeing him run off at the end of Act 3.

The corps as the swans were graceful and, with Osipova as their Queen, a close-knit sisterhood. The Act 3 national dances were vibrant and danced very well, I admired them all. The pas de trois in Act 1 (performed by Francesca Hayward, Alexander Campbell, and Yuhui Choe) was beautiful too; I especially liked Hayward and saw her dancing as very lush. I hope she becomes a principal with the company!

The only quibble I have is some of the acting and costumes could be improved or simply removed. Parts of the ballet have appeared shallow since the creation of this Swan Lake (by former dancer Anthony Dowell) for the Royal Ballet and I understand that that is why the company is having a new production done for them. Still, I'd like some of the costumes, sets, and especially the dancing to remain the same. Hopefully, this new production will showcase the company at its best.",1451520000,,2038,4.637119113573407
7154555,5,B00WUKI0NW,"I did not like the Nunez/Soares performance from a couple of years ago but this one was great.  I loved both the leads.  Osipova is amazing in both roles and I really am enjoying Golding as a dancer.  I still find the egg shaped mirror in the ballroom to be annoying and some of the costumes in the attendees of the ball sort of make me think of the ones in Phantom.  Over all though I liked this performance a lot.  And, like at least one other person commented, I was delighted that Ospiova was able to do the appropriate mime at the lake.  I have always loved the Makarova/Dowell version BUT watching Dowell work so hard on his part while Makarova does not respond is, to say the least, difficult.  It is such a shame that the Soviets did indeed deny generations of ballerinas the ability to ""tell the story"".",1448064000,2,812,4.337748344370861
7154556,5,B00WUKI0NW,"New and beautiful interpretation by the ROYAL BALLET an the extraordinary PRINCIPAL danceurs duet , OSIPOVA is with out doubt, a one of a class ballerina, ... I have and other BLURAY / SWAN LAKE with the Mariinsky St. Petersburg with Uliana Lopatkina, art critics acknowledge she has dedicated herself to the perfection and interpretation of this master piece and being that and extraordinary interpratation it is very hard to say wich is better.
 It is a magnificent clasical reproduced in the magic of BLURAY, definition and sound are superb, the lavish costumes and wardrobe that the play required according to the recreation of the time this ballet was composed are appreciated in full detail.",1446854400,,697,5.060869565217391
7154557,5,B00WUKI0NW,"For the last few years, the Royal Ballet Covent Garden has been putting on a new production of Swan Lake, directed by Anthony Dowell, featuring 19th century Russian costumes and dcor.  This theme seems to be a tribute to the general time and place of the composition of the ballet by Tchaikovsky.  There are two recordings of this on disc, both available in Blu-ray: the first with Marianela Nunez and Thiago Soares; the second and newer with Natalia Osipova and Matthew Golding.  The Russian ambience is very sumptuous and rather dark...appropriate to the tragic story.  Some reviewers have complained of Siegfried's dark costume, against the dark set.  However, I have no problem with this and find that I can see his outlines -- and the compositions Siegfried's body makes with Odette/Odile's -- just fine.  The suppression of Siegfried's wonderful solo at the beginning of Act 2 of the classic Makarova/Dowell version is more of a problem for me...but far from a deal breaker, since these two newer versions generally have fewer flaws than all the many other ones I own copies of or have seen either recorded or live.
So now the question is which of the two is the better.  I saw the Nunez version first and was quite taken not only with her dancing but also with her acting.  She gives meaning to every single one of her moves and gestures.  You always know what she's thinking and how she is feeling.  This seems to be a triumph of the Anglo-Saxon preference for dramatic vividness as opposed to the Russian tendency to focus far more on the dancing than on acting.  Since the former is what I prefer, I found Nunez to be the ultimate Odette/Odile because she combined consummate dancing with seemingly unprecedented attention to meaning and gesture.
...But then I just recently purchased and watched the Osipova version.  At first, I couldn't help noticing that she seemed more distant and that her acting was much more muted.  However, by the end of the performance, and after going back and watching the Nunez version, I found that I was, quite surprisingly, even more affected by this performance than by the other.  Don't get me wrong, I love them both, and having them both in my private library is a must.  But there are certain rather subtle factors that make me put Osipova slightly higher.  First of all, she is, quite unbelievably, an even greater dancer than Nunez.  Yeah, this is rather like comparing Bugattis and Lamborghinis...but I really think now that Osipova wins because of her utter, unmatched mastery of the balletic art.  Her DANCING told me what she was thinking and feeling...so I really didn't need her to act so much.  What a surprise!  Actually, her subtler playing of the role made her end up seeming more vulnerable in the end...and the whole ballet more like a fairy tale.  Watching the newer version made me feel more as though I were witnessing the highest imaginable level of art.  There were other factors that contributed to this.  The music direction in the second version, under Boris Gruzin, was just a bit more sensitive, never rushing anything...except for the fact that Gruzin speeded up Odile's 32 fouettes in the third act because Osipova apparently has no limits!  Also, the camerawork in the second version is a bit better, with more poignant close-ups at just the right time.  Finally, though both are available on blu-ray, the second version was made in better HD.  Ballet is a visual art, so what can I say?  The HD image is so crisp that it almost looks like 3D.
So, in conclusion, get both...but if, for some strange reason, you only want one, then go for Osivopa.",1444867200,36,3622,4.762820512820513
7154558,5,B00WUKI0NW,"This is a beautiful production and well worth having, to see again and again. It was shown ""live in HD"" at the local movie theatre in the spring, but I missed it because I had a prior commitment, so I'm very happy to have this on a DVD. Thanks!",1439164800,,244,4.0

8714372,3,B00WUKI0NW,"When I buy a DVD and it turns out to be disappointing, I donate it to the local library.  The same with this DVD.  Why? The stage design is quite annoying:  too  busy, distracting and it virtually overwhelms the dancers and the dancing. Apparently, the designer did not have the dancers in mind, only 'a' stage design. Moreover, it bears no relationship to the ""fairy"" tale being told. Its profound psychological implications also are lost.
It seems that when a stage designer's imagination fails, the problem is solved by setting the action at another time and place.  Sometimes it works.  Here it doesn't.",1510963200,,607,4.844660194174757

8714375,1,B00WUKI0NW,"One good thing that can be said for this, is that it could have been worst. The blurb says the sets were inspired by fabregy, and inspired is hardly the word; more accurate would be ""abomination of."" The sets for the first three acts look like a broken down gothic cathedral that has been abandoned for five centuries. The set for the fourth act could have been from a cheap horror film from the '30s. Colors in general are very dark to black.

If these were the only problems I wouldn't complain but this is just the start. The worst is that the corps are in long, thick skirts so no line from legs, torso and arms interacting. It's just a blob. Then the style of the lead ballerina is to soften the line. So arms and body don't snap into position. All movements are soft and blurred. The SF ballet is doing the same with their swan lake. Fred Astaire said ballet is ""too stiff.""

15 years ago a ballet instructor said that the art is dying and this production is a clear document of this. The market for classical music is 2% so it looks like ballet is just following the same path to death. A music professor said that if it weren't for the top 5% income tax bracket the opera houses would be empty. So what little that has survived the aping of the culture has turned back into aristocratic culture. It's only a matter of time before they storm the Bastille. But they probably won't have to as we're avidly commiting suicide on the altars of multiculturalism. Don't waste your money on the blu ray.",1491868800,3,1502,4.360714285714286
8714376,2,B00WUKI0NW,"I am giving this Anthony Dowell directed production a two star rating for the following reasons:

The tempo was too slow in many passages making the dances tediously boring. The only commendable aspect of the orchestra was the Prologue.

The choreography was sloppy, dull, and not impressive throughout. There was way too much mime.  When I want to watch this much mime I will watch Marcel Marceau.  I want to see the story told in dancing.  Surely, this was not the intent of Petipa nor Mariinsky.  For the absolute best choreography I've seen is Rudolph Nureyev's interpretation.  If you are looking for a top rate Swan Lake with great choeography check out the Vienna State Ballet, Vienna, Austria 2014 production. Manuel Legris is the Ballet Director.  Conducted by Alexander Ingram. The choeography is by Rudolph Nureyev, after Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov.  The two real ballet superstars are Olga Esina (Odette/Odile) and Vladimir Shishov (Prince Siegfried). Both are superb actors and dancers.

The sets in this Royal Ballet Covent Garden production of Swan Lake, directed by Anthony Dowell, were a total fiasco.  Set and Props took up so much space the dancers did not have enough room to carry out their routines.  The dark sets were something one would expect from a Dracula movie, morbid and cluttered. The performances were very weak as a result.

The stilted, over dramatic movements of Matthew Golding is what I would expect in an old B-rated silent movie. A lack of expression was prevalent in the characters.  Matthew Golding should take acting lesson.  Most of the time he looked spaced out.  When he finally did dance, his dancing was dull.  The only time he showed any appropriate facial expression was in the final part of the final scene of the Ballet.

In this production Rothbart was comically tacky.  His costume was  ridiculous.  All he does is run around flapping his feathery arm.  When he is transformed in Act Three, he could adequately be described as a Thug in leotards.  He does not dance.  The best Rothbart for Act Three of any production can be found in the American Ballet Theatre production (Washington, D.C. 2005). Marcelo Gomes is wickedly phenomenal.  Gomes sets the standard for any dancer in this role. However, the Green Goblin Rothbart (Isaac Stappus) is absolutely ridiculous in this production.

Quite unlike Anthony Dowell's statement that this production would take away the ""cringe factor,"" I cringed nearly through the whole thing and I am a ballet fan. This is one production I would not dare allow my hockey/playing son-in-laws to watch.  They would cringe themselves out the door laughing hysterically.

My advise is for you to find another Swan Lake to purchase.  There are several good ones to be found.  Do not waste your time nor money on this one.",1483574400,2,2806,4.933760683760684
