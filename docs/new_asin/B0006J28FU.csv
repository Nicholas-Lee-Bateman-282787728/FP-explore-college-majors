8041758,3,B0006J28FU,"Playhouse is a horror-comedy that works a whole lot better as a comedy than as a horror movie. It's about people being murdered in a haunted playhouse. The inept detective on the case is absolutely hilarious and pretty much makes the movie worth sitting through. The horror elements didn't really do much for me, to be honest. Most of the deaths are off-screen and it's never really scary. See it for the detective.",1292716800,,415,4.698630136986301

8041762,5,B0006J28FU,"Playhouse is a great example of the wonder of small budget films...it possesses an ability to keep you entertained with it's perfect mix of witt and gore. The acting was just as commendable! All of the actors, from leads all the way to that boy making out with the girl in the woods kept you engaged in the plot and ready for the next laugh or scream. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who enjoys a good thrill or a giggle. Go buy it...you won't be disappointed.",1109894400,2,467,4.318181818181818
