3517232,5,B001CQONNQ,This TV series is one of the best.  The productions were always well done.  Excellent actors and story-lines.  Would recommend.,1227571200,,127,5.25
3517233,5,B001CQONNQ,JAG was one of the best shows on TV and I still miss seeing it after 3 years.  It was a good tribute to our service men and women and showed them as normal human beings doing a difficult job that put their life on the line.  It also had its humorous moments in addition to the drama.  I have all 7 seasons released so far and love watching the shows again.  For some reason a person never tires of watching them over and over again.  Not many shows have that kind of appeal.,1226361600,,474,4.0
3517234,5,B001CQONNQ,"You won't be disappointed with this season. If you haven't seen the previous series...WATCH THEM! You'll be addicted immediately.
Very well made and all the actors are top notch.
I was in the Navy and know for a fact that they had a Navy liason working with the shows cast/crew for authentication.
Buy all the seasons. Worth every penney!",1225670400,3,338,4.745762711864407
3517235,5,B001CQONNQ,"I'm preordered for season 7. It's really funny how these shows that we love so much and collect all start out by getting thrown out of the line up after a few episodes, just to find us all begging for their return. I am very frugal about what I collect as far as DVD's go. Jag is the ONLY TV series that I've collected so far. I don't hesitate to buy the next season as soon as it comes out. And now I'm pre - ordering ! I'm hooked. I loved the show when it was on TV, and now I'll have all of the season's whenever they get them finished. I know I'll be watching these DVD's as long as my DVD player works and I can see and hear - LOL.",1223337600,,636,3.789473684210526
3517236,5,B001CQONNQ,"I have watched Jag on TV after it finished its run as a series, and I regret not watching it when it was being made. I love the series. I later found out at the end of the run, that Trevor Goddard who played Mic Brumby may have died. Is that so? What happened to the man? He was such a man you loved to dislike at times, but such a good actor. I appreciated how the Navy is portrayed in this series, as well as the justice system in the program. Thankyou for this. I would like to see the seasons 7 through 10 speeded up as well. Could you share what ever happened to  John M. Jackson and the rest of the crew and what they are doing today? Thanks...

  Alfred  S.",1221091200,,664,3.925373134328358

3517238,5,B001CQONNQ,"I never used to watch TV in the morning until I happened to see JAG and have been a faithful ""watcher"" since. Unfortunately because of my work I have missed a lot of episodes. I have 1 to 5 series but I wish they would release all of them so I can have them all- in one package. I think it is the best put together drama- the cast is excellent and they all seem to be perfect for their roles, all attuned to each other. Altho my main hero is David Elliott, everyone is integral to the quality of each episode, superbly written and acted. I have not seen a more handsome and well put together man in years. Inspite of the fact that I was never in the military, I feel that it is very accurate in its depiction of the conditions in the real JAG. It is a drama that takes itself seriously- and rightly so.",1218758400,14,802,4.050314465408805
3517239,5,B001CQONNQ,I am anxious to order seasons 7-10 and wish that production could be speeded up on these DVD sets. JAG has been an inspiration to me and has fostered a great deal of patriotism.  Please rush the production schedule as much as possible.,1218240000,18,235,4.465116279069767

3517335,4,B001CQONNQ,"I did not see these when they were on TV, so I am watching them in retrospect to see how the series led to NCIS.  The writing doesn't quite measure up to that of NCIS, but the use of characters' backstories to move the action forward keeps one watching for the details.",1399507200,,269,4.173076923076923
3517336,4,B001CQONNQ,"I like all the episodes of this show/I guess it is in part due to seeing men & women in uniform as well as watching Elliot, Bell,  and Jackson perfect their craft so as to make their roles so believable to me.

3517344,5,B001CQONNQ,I always enjoy JAG episodes. The courtroom scenes are challenging and often have surprise outcomes. The war scenes are heart rending but help me see what our armed forces go through.,1391299200,,182,4.903225806451613
3517345,5,B001CQONNQ,"One of the most infuriating aspects of DVDs is when the making of them doesn't let you skip the opening and go to the start of the episode.  You only need to see so many of the opening name and scenes that repeated each week of the series, when watching episode after episode.  Additionally, they have an all play, so you don't have to go back to the menu each time,scroll down the list to the next episode in sequence and select it - you can watch one, it ends, the beginning comes on, you hit skip and into the next episode you are - delightful.  Besides this is a series worth watching and re-watching and sometimes insightful to how the legal system does and does not work.",1388534400,,677,4.2734375

Mac's engagement to Brumby comes to an abrupt end and that's just the first part of this excellent season.  Each of the actor's has settled into their roles and are all believable.  The military part of the show is true to life.  The uniforms and medals are correct and the military courtesies are also portrayed well.  This has always been one of my favorite series as are its spinoffs (NCIS and NCIS: LA). If you like courtroom and military drama then this is a must haves.  It certainly is for me.

I find it is the only thing on TV that holds my interest, episode after episode. I missed having the Admiral show up for the finale. He should have been there. I enjoy all of the characters and their interaction with each other.  The actors are all terrific, especially David James Elliot and Catherine Bell.  They have a great chemistry.  I also like Bud because he is funny and lends a good comic relief sometimes. Someone should put a bug in the ear of the Bellisario Productions to (at the very least) make a movie showing what the characters are doing now. The show has been over for 6 years so it's about time they do a follow-up using the original actors.  JAG should be brought back!!.",1311033600,,819,4.397350993377484

Starting with Mac's marriage to Brumby being indefinitely postponed and ending with a hi-jacked Russian sub ready to launch an attack against the US, the seventh season is full of action and clashes in and out of the courtroom. However, you can't help but wonder if Mac and Harm wouldn't be better off getting hitched to each other! Bud sees active service, with Harriet getting more and more worried about his safety. Espionage plays a major part in some episodes, with the main heroes functioning more as unofficial agents than lawyers. On the whole, it's good, clean fun, with lots of smart-aleck one-liners, mostly on the part of Admiral Chegwidden and Mac!",1229817600,,745,4.920634920634921

I had never seen one preview for the show in my limited TV viewing, so I did not know that this was an ongoing series.  In any event Season 7 of JAG is the classic JAG when all the characters were still likeable.  This is a show that can be watched by every member of the family without any embarassment.  Some episodes get preachy at times, but I love the fact that there was never any over-the-top violence, just real-life exaggerated stories about the military and lawyers doing things they would never do in real life.  But that's entertainment.  I don't think I could stomach a lawyer reality show.  That would be boring to tears.

(Example: ""CORAL SEA"" shown as a supercarrier - the calling an aircraft carrier the Seahawk - there are plenty of good names of current and former carriers they can use.

The character development is rich and new characters introduced into this season are compelling and not merely outwardly attractive.  JAG's line-up are believable and endearing.  What I like about this show is how basically decent and ennobling the characters are. You feel better not worse for having spent time with them.  The series touches on issues of prejudice, the use of torture in interrogating suspected terrorists, all without pandering to our baser instincts while acknowledging they are there.  I have found nothing that disappoints in this 7th season and I'm certain that anyone who is a fan doesn't need this review to buy the set.",1229040000,2,824,5.066666666666666
