8403771,4,B003RHZ6DY,"""How does one live when one stops living?"" is the question Norman asks. Landscape, dialogues, emotions...all represent 'bleak'. A tightly held emotional roller coaster where the low end of emotions are picturised very un-dramatically. 3 stories run side by side with audience left to wonder what they might be connected with. I found the movie interesting in the beginning but kind of dreary in the middle and then rushed to the end. But it is haunting...the music, the shots of London...might watch it again after few days only for that!
Life goes on...is the feeling one gets at the end when the river flows and the crowd walks on the bridge.",1433030400,,644,4.8108108108108105
8403772,3,B003RHZ6DY,"I don`t know why this movie garnered all the raves it received.  I found it rather tedious.  Perhaps in it`s day it was considered great but not by me today. I`m a big John Barry fan with many, many of his soundtracks including this one, but I don`t think this is one of the better ones so I won`t rave about it either.",1347494400,,319,4.0476190476190474
8403773,5,B003RHZ6DY,"I will not include plot spoilers but I will add that this requires a second viewing a few days later. Unfairly lobbed into the ""Kitchen Sink Realism"" shelf of British cinema, ""Four In The Morning"" is so much more. Stunning John Barry score and shots of the Thames in the days of yesteryear when it was a very busy working, commuting and shipping hub. If you are on the fence about seeing this don't be; this is an amazing film by one of the UK's greatest directors. Anthony Simmons who also did ""The Optimists"" and ""Black Joy"" has made some of the only REAL films about TRUE Londoners currently available.",1331683200,8,605,4.509090909090909
8403774,4,B003RHZ6DY,"West One Film Producers presents Best of the British Classics ""FOUR IN THE MORNING"" (1965) (90 min/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered & restored) --- First of all, a haunting score by John Barry, who has always come up with classic melodies and themes for film --- Though the script is a little on the dreary side, can become over taxing for viewing --- Three separate stories are inclusive with this film which makes for an intriguing view  --- But the actors pull this off and the drama is full steam ahead --- There are excellent British ""Kitchen-Sink"" films out there and this ranks high among them.
