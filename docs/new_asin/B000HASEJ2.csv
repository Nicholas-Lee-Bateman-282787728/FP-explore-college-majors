8137923,5,B000HASEJ2,"this is one of her best DVD's ever, bought it back in 2008, wore out the disk and wanted to replace it. I'm extremely disgruntled that it now ranges in price on Amazon for $48.00 - $200.00 and something. This feels like betrayal. I refuse to re-purchase from these robbers.  I'm highly disapointed and hope to find my mom's version she has on VHS, and pay to convert it to a DVD.  - super bummed.",1406160000,,396,4.266666666666667

8137925,5,B000HASEJ2,I probably own 20 or so of Sansone's DVDs. I change workouts weekly. This one is a shortcut so I am able to use it often. Thank you Seller.,1341878400,,139,3.8275862068965516
8137926,5,B000HASEJ2,"I have been using Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's for about 3 months. Over a 6 month period, I have lost 35 pounds. I carry most of my weight around my middle and was looking for exercises to help target this area. I think this workout is excellent. It has an easy 4 minute walking warm-up and then about 20-25 min of ab/back concentration. I have always felt that I had NO abdominal strength. After doing the walking, I must have started to build some core strength as I was able to do this entire workout the first time. Even though I could do it the first time, it has remained challenging and I do it about three times a week. I can finally suck in my stomach because there are some muscles underneath the fat that I still have to lose. I agree with another reviewer that you must do cardio/fat burning exercises to see real results. I do not tire as easily now that I have built some core strength. I definitely recommend this video - Leslie is very soothing and encouraging and the one-on-one is refreshing. Good luck!",1245628800,3,1023,4.389473684210526
8137927,4,B000HASEJ2,"While I agree with a previous reviewer than this is NOT the most intense of ab workouts it nonetheless is a very good one. Some of the exercises are better than others. For instance, the ""scissors"" can be felt very deeply in the abdominal muscles. The tape starts with a good four to five minute walking warmup then proceeds on to a series of exercises both for the frontal abs and for the opposing muscles in the back. I consider Leslie Sansone being very astute in acknowleging that along with abs the back muscles need to be worked out. This she has an edge over many other exercise instructors who ONLY stress working out the abs.  Good job Leslie Sansone!",1242345600,5,660,4.5
8137928,2,B000HASEJ2,"I love Leslie, but I was dissappointed with this workout. I didn't feel like I did much of anything. Perhaps I need something more intense because this definitely is not intense. But it is nice if you are beginner or just a quick, easy workout.

She does a little walking warm-up then does a series of ab exercises. It is about 30 minutes long. She says to start out by using it 2-3 times a week. I am fairly confident that you can do this one every day if you have done any exercise before.

It was recommended to do this workout after any other aerobic exercise to make it more effective. I just don't have the time to exercise every day for an hour and half or whatever. Also keep in mind that for effective weight loss, you should not just do abs, but do total body conditioning and aerobic exercises. You cannot target areas and expect effective weight loss.",1221436800,3,863,4.354037267080745
8137929,5,B000HASEJ2,"this is a great dvd if you want to fix your abs. it's hard & painful, but with good results!",1202428800,2,92,3.65
8137930,5,B000HASEJ2,"A great Ab workout by Leslie. She begins with a gentle 4 to 5 minute walk for warming up, then the remaining 25 minutes fly by working out your abs then ends with some exercises and stretches for your lower back and torso.",1176681600,14,222,4.186046511627907
