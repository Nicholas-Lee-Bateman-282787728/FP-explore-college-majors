8287023,3,B001CDFXWO,"Nice dance grooves, good music, decent choreography. You can't really follow the choreography, however, because of the horrid camera action. The camera zooms in on the dancers' faces just as they are showing a new move, then as soon as you finally see their bodies move, the camera zooms in on the feet, or flies over their heads. Ridiculous! I couldn't follow the flamenco section at all because of this. The camera literally never stays put for more then a 30 seconds. Also, it's one of those videos shot in a warehouse garage. Ugly lighting. The dancers are pretty awesome, especially Gloria. I hope she can afford to be in a better quality exercise video.",1415404800,,659,4.739130434782608
