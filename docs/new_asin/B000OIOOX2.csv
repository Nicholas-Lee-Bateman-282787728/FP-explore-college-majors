2796947,5,B000OIOOX2,"First off, let me start off by typing the titles of the episodes included in this DVD, just in case you didn't know what they were yet:

212. Village of Vengeance (Part IV)
213. Village of Vengeance (Part V)
214. Name of the Game
215. The Dark One Cometh (Part I)
216. The Dark One Cometh (Part II)
217. The Dark One Cometh (Part III)
218. The Dark One Cometh (Part IV)
219. In the Name of the Pharaoh
220. The Final Journey
221. The Final Duel (Part I)
222. The Final Duel (Part II)
223. The Final Duel (Part III)
224. The Final Duel (Part IV)

So, this DVD concludes the Yu-Gi-Oh! television series with an outstanding series finale.  The bad thing about this is that it is the end, and after watching all 224 episodes of this show - you're left wanting for more (especially after you see the last five episodes).  Basically, the Egyptian Arc ends in the episode ""IN THE NAME OF THE PHARAOH.""  To give kind of a quick synopsis of what happens up to that point: the Pharaoh continues his battle with Bakura, Zorc The Dark One is (in fact) resurrected, Kaiba joins their little adventure, Master Akhenaden turns more evil than he already was, the Pharaoh's name is or is not revealed (I don`t want to spoil it!), and the Blue Eyes plays an important part in the ending.  Then, after the everyone escapes the past...there is one more task left to be accomplished.  Yugi must defeat the Pharaoh in a duel in order to set the Pharaoh's spirit free.  If Yugi looses, the Pharaoh is trapped within the Millennium Puzzle for another 5,000 years.  But if Yugi wins, the Pharaoh will leave them all for ever.  Like stated before, the ending of Yu-Gi-Oh! will make you cry because it is very sad indeed, but it's definitely worth watching if you've purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Gi-Oh-Season-5-Dawn-of-the-Duel-Part-1/dp/B000MTOM94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu-Gi-Oh - Season 5 - Dawn of the Duel - Part 1</a>&nbsp;and all the other DVDs of this anime.  I thought all these episodes were very well written and the story itself was amazing.  When you see Pegasus in ""THE FINAL JOURNEY"" and you actually hears what he says, you get that feeling that everything is about to end and that the series was not rushed at all, but was instead all leading up to this moment since the beginning.  Though it is sad, it's a definite must-see - no doubts about that!  The only regret is that, like another customer pointed out in another review, the ending was cut short by like a minute.  In the Japanese version, you see what a lot of characters were doing at the end  (during the credits, of course).  Anyway, all in all, this is a beautiful conclusion to the Yu-Gi-Oh! show and I recommend buying it!  BUT WE WARNED: IT IS SAD!  I AM NOT EXAGGERATING!",1199491200,9,2791,4.717525773195876
2796948,5,B000OIOOX2,"Having been a long time fan of the anime Yu-Gi-Oh, I was thrilled with the final series of episodes.  Masterfully written and performed with the same emotions as the Japanese originals, I was greatly impressed.  I recommend this to any fan.",1199145600,9,240,4.829268292682927
2796949,5,B000OIOOX2,"I am a 26 year old female whom ABSOLUTELY LOVES Yu-Gi-Oh! but actually,it is my roommate and myself whom are die-hard fans/collectors...
my roommate likes Marik Ishtar,Kaiba,and Pegasus while I mainly like Pharaoh Atem/Yami Yugi,Yugi Muto,Ryou AKA Bakura,(""Ryou"" is his name in the Japanese version as ""Bakura"" is the name of Yami Bakura AKA the
Evil Bakura in the Japanese version!)and Yami Bakura also known as
The Evil Spirit Of The Ring.
  Anyways,I've seen the last few episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! as I have it in the Japanese version because I have a friend who has burned a copy of EVERY Yu-Gi-Oh! episode EVER MADE although a handful of them are in Japanese text and English subtitles,though.  I also had the ENTIRE first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX burned as well+ALL the un-Americanized Yu-Gi-Oh! episodes...YES,THE VERY ORIGINAL ONES!
  However,Yu-Gi-Oh! fans of all ages should have a box of Kleenex ready once the FINAL outcome of the entire Yu-Gi-Oh! series has been fulfilled...PHEW!  WE ALL THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER END!  It's unfortunate that the entire Yu-Gi-Oh! series ended the way it did since we ALL didn't want to cry towards the end but what happened was bound to happen sooner or later...perhaps I've said too much...oh well!  I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of this one!  Thanks So Much+Peace Out!

8185351,5,B000OIOOX2,"Welcome to the Final chapter of the popular YuGiOh series. The end is near for the Pharaoh & his friends. The storyline is loaded with some of the best action ever witnessed within the entire YuGiOh anime series. The plot is very epic & fast paced to cover all of the storyline before the conclusion.
The voice acting is well done. The dialogue is very urgent & fits well with the anime's level of urgency. Enough said.
Highly recommend this to the fans of the YuGiOh anime series.

8185352,5,B000OIOOX2,"Yu-Gi-Oh! tells the tale of Yugi Mutou, a shorter-than-average high school student who was given the fragmented pieces of an ancient Egyptian artifact, the Millennium Puzzle, by his grandfather. Upon reassembling the Puzzle, he is possessed by another personality who is later revealed to be the spirit of a 3,000-year-old Pharaoh (5,000-years-old in the English anime) called Atem, with no memory of his own time. As the story goes on, the two of them (together with Yugi's friends), try to find the secret of the Pharaoh's lost memories and his name, with the Duel Monsters card game being an ever prevalent backdrop or plot device.

This dvd is for season 5. Season 5 was split into 3 parts.
  1. Grand Championship/episodes 185-198
  2. Capsule Monsters(SPECIAL)/Not tv series episodes but take place between Grand Championship and Dawn of the Duel
  3. Dawn of the Duel/episodes 199-224

Dawn of the Duel is also split into 2 parts.
  Part 1. Millennium World
  Part 2. Ceremonial Battle

Millenium World Plot
  With three God Cards in his possession, Yami Yugi (Dark Yugi in the original Japanese, ""yami"" being the Japanese word for ""darkness"") is ready to find all his lost memories. However, he's in for more than he bargains for when he is thrust into the World of Memory, an alternate reality inside the Millennium Puzzle based on the events that occurred in Egypt 5,000 years ago (3,000 years ago in the Japanese anime). There, the Pharaoh must relive the last days of his previous life, fighting his old enemies and reuniting with his old friends. But his new friends have not forgotten about him, and Yugi and his friends travel inside the Millennium Puzzle to find the World of Memory and help the Pharaoh recover all his memories. However, Yami Bakura (Dark Bakura in the Japanese anime) plans on using the information gained in the World of Memory to gain the powers of the Millennium Items and reawaken an ancient evil that has remained dormant for the past 5,000 years.

Ceremonial Battle Plot
  Pharaoh Atem has obtained all seven millennium items, acquired all three Egyptian God Cards, defeated Zorc Necrophades in the Memory World, and has found out all about his past, including his name. Now, the pharaoh can quietly leave the mortal world, and join his faithful priests in the afterlife. However, the doorway to the afterlife can only be opened if the pharaoh is defeated in a duel. Yugi takes on the challenge, dueling Atem to let him go. Even though Atem would very much want to go to the afterlife, he has a good pride in his skills, and will never let anybody beat him easily. Another reason is because Atem wants to see if Yugi is independent and can win a duel without his help. However, Atem is defeated by Yugi and proceeds to enter the afterlife, much to his new friends' dismay.

This dvd continues and finishes the Millenium World plot(where the last dvd left off) and continues with the Ceremonial Battle plot in it's entirety. This dvd is also the EDITED ENGLISH DUBB version. This dvd has some of the best voice casting,story and picture+audio quality I've seen for 1990's anime that's been put and REMASTERED on Region 1 dvd.

This is a SUPER SPECIAL AWESOME series in my opinion and I rate it 5/5 stars.
Unfortunatly,This title has been discontinued. I suggest you get this series if you can find it.",1249430400,3,3341,4.7874564459930316
