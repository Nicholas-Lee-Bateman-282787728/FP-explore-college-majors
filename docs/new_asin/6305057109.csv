7882280,3,6305057109,"This is a nice, touristy, video of Oatman, Arizona; once a famous gold mining town in western Arizona and now a tourist attraction on the road that was once U.S.  66. That section of the old highway is considered an attraction in itself  as it winds and twists through the Black Mountains. Regrettably, this video mentions the road very briefly early on and doesn't mention it again. I suspect the makers of this video were trying to cash in on the ""Route 66"" angle. In any event, they really don't deliver on anything ""66"".  If you're interested in the  road itself, like I am, this really isn't your video. ""Down Route  66"" should be dropped from the title to give a more accurate  description.",941673600,5,696,4.57258064516129
