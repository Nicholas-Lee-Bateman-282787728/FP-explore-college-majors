404895,5,6301982746,"This film is different from the other sequels, which makes it one of the best in the series.  Directed by the director of the original Rocky, ROCKY V goes back to its oscar-winning roots.  It takes place right after the fight with Drago where Rocky comes home not feeling quite right after the bout.  At the airport, he's confronted by a Don King-type person who continuously wants to see him fight.  Later, it seemed that Paulie (Burt Young) had screwed up some papers with the Balboa's accountant thereby bankrupting them.  And Rocky finds out he suffered severe brain trauma and is unable to fight.  Rocky and his family are forced to live back in Philadelphia.  There Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, and up and coming boxer who he agrees to manage only so he can get the thrill he had before he was forced to retire.  Tommy Gunn later gets corrupted by that Don King type and ditches Rocky.  In the midst of all this, Rocky starts to lose his family, especially his son(Sage Stallone, his real-life son) After Gunn gets the heavyweight title, he is bitterly hated for abandoning Rocky and not truly getting the title from Rocky.  So he confronts Rocky in a blind rage and ends up fighting him in a street fight.  Guess who wins?  It is a great end to the series with strong performances by Stallone, Shire, Morrisson, and even Stallone's son a little bit.  The score by Conti is mediocore with rap ensembles and some familar Rocky tunes.  The ending street fight has a remix theme of several memorable themes throughout the series.  But in the end, the Elton John song ""Measure of a Man"" makes this movie what it is.  It is played over the credits and black and white photos throughout the series, ending in the final shot of the Rocky statue at the top of those famous stairs.  It's very conclusive.  Speaking of shots, the choreography itself is done spectacularly, especially in the street fight when a whole bunch of images flash before Rocky's eyes that motivate him to fight Tommy Gunn.  A great movie that is much better than a lot of people say it is.",995587200,,2055,4.565573770491803
404896,3,6301982746,"Confused? Well, the movie itself was very well written. If you've watched the ROCKY series and truly understood it, then V's story makes sense in a linear way. The character of Rocky Balboa has come full circle, from bum to star to bum. Rocky's older now, and the boxing game is much different. After losing his riches to a crooked accountant, losing brain cells to years of repeated beatings (most notably by Ivan Drago in IV), and losing respect by a Don King-like promoter, Rocky feels every bit the loser he did back in the original ROCKY. He tries to continue living his boxing career vicariously through a new protege, with disastrous results. And although his boxing career is over, Rocky still proves he is the best there is at what he does (ala Wolverine) by returning to his street-fighting roots. Without giving away the ending of the movie, the point is that Rocky has his family, and the rest of life's troubles mean nothing when up against that fact.
So it was a well-written movie, but I personally didn't care for it all that much. Right off the bat, I hate it when the good guys get screwed. I don't mind seeing Rocky beat up, for whatever reason, but it really gets to me that after five films, he winds up in the gutter again, despite it being done realistically. Also, the soundtrack to the movie sucked big time. Rap music? For Pete's sake, what happened to ""Eye of the Tiger""? What happened to Vince DiCola? And the climactic street fight wasn't corepgraphed well, I thought. It went on too long, and Rocky took beatings in thew wrong parts. When you hear that triumphant Rocky theme start to play (even if only fort a few seconds), you expect that fight to be over a few seconds later. Instead, every time it looked like Rocky won, his opponent kept jumping up like the killer in a slasher flick. And call me a sap, but I prefer an ending where the hero wins big, rather than just survives.
So, while not a great ending, it is at least a definite and plausible ending. ROCKY V may be the worst of the series, but it's still ok, and worth a viewing at least once for closure's sake. Go ahead and get the collection, you'll get 3 great movies, and two okay ones.
Fun fact: in a ""rare"" display of Hollywood nepotism, we find that Stallone's son can actually act. Although I will never figure out how that character manages to age so quickly. In III, he looked about 7. IV took place the day after, and he looked to be about 10. V took place soon after IV, and now he's about 14.

404980,2,6301982746,"Review and thoughts on Rocky V (and the Rocky franchise).

I wasn't really sure how many stars to rate this movie.

I ended up giving Rocky V a two star, but in some ways, it may deserve a three star; it depends on how or what one is specifically critiquing with this movie.

I don't own a copy of this film (I do own a copy of Part 1), but Ive seen parts 1 through Rocky Balboa (part 6) on cable television in the last few months (fall of 2017), so I have in fact seen part V.

A lot of Rocky fans despise this particular entry in the Rocky series. I do not.

Before I address the arguable mess that is part 5, a few words about part 4.

----- ROCKY IV -----

I actually believe that Rocky IV (part 4) is the weakest link in the Rocky film franchise, not, as many fans argue, part 5.

I am stunned at the many fans who think IV is a work of merit but who spit on part V.

Rocky parts 1 and 2 were solid, with part 1 being excellent.

Part 3 was middling- to- fair, though the bad guy (Clubber Lang) was a little on the cartoonish side and it was with part 3 that the descent in quality for Rocky films began, as far as I am concerned.

By part 4, things have gone so far off the reservation with the Rocky movies, I don't feel as though Im watching a Rocky movie.

Oh yes, the Rocky Balboa character is in the movie, hes in part IV (4), but it feels like Rocky is in it by mistake.

In Rocky 4, Rocky ends up fighting a large Soviet boxer named Drago in the U.S.S.R.

Its not so much that this movie, Rocky IV, is a dated relic of the Cold War that bothers me, or that its obviously pushing American patriotism to an absurd degree, that bothers me (these are complaints I've seen raised a few times by other movie reviewers).

I don't even mind seeing Apollo Creed dance to James Brown's Living in America.

There is just some hard- to- define quality to this film, part 4, that makes it too jokey, cartoony for a Rocky movie

And I don't mean the aformentioned James Brown segment, and so on. Theres something else going on here with Part 4 that is amiss, and it's hard to pin down.

This movie, part 4, is fine as an entertaining vehicle, its okay as mindless fun to pass away two hours on a rainy afternoon, but it just does not read as a Rocky movie to me.

Part 4 is miles away in tone from Rocky part 1, which really bothers me, because part 1 should have set the gold standard for any sequels (though honestly, I wish Stallone had stopped at part 1, or at least part 2).

Even part 2 was more grounded in reality, and part 3 (sans the Clubber Lang character) was not that far off from reality.

But something really jumped off the rails with part 4, and its hard to define.

---- ROCKY V ----

I think part 5 was an attempted course correction.

Id like to think Stallone, or whomever is responsible for these Rocky movies, finally realized how bizarre and out of place part 4 was to the series, and tried to get back to Rockys roots with part 5.

Was part 5 entirely successful? No, by no means.

But at least part 5 is an attempt to get back to gritty reality and tone of Part 1 and away from the 'Saturday Morning Cartoon' feel of part IV.

Some of the story ideas or concepts behind part 5 were interesting or solid  they were only executed poorly.

---- STREET FIGHT Vs. RING -----

Some Rocky fans complain that this film did not end with an in the ring boxing match between Rocky and a bad guy.

Instead, we were treated to a street fight between Rocky and his former protg in the film, Tommy Gunn. (The Gunn character turns into a villain of sorts through the course of the movie.)

I can kind of see how replacing a ring fight with a street fight was annoying for some fans, but it did not completely bother me.

Honestly, by part 5, having sat through four previous movies where every single one had a ring fight, I was ready to see a variation here and there on the tried and true Rocky movie formula.

At this stage, Rocky really was not supposed to be a professional boxer any way, so he had to avoid the ring:

Rockys wife Adrian asked him to quit boxing in part five after brain scans by the doctor showed he had some brain damage.

Adrian, his wife, asked him to retire from boxing, because she loved him  she was concerned for him  she didn't ask  him to quit because she was whiny or a naggy kill-joy, as so many reviewers have complained in various Rocky movie reviews.

----- LOSS OF WEALTH -----

As to the fans who complain that by part 5 that Rocky lost all his money, his mansion, and his sports cars: well, no kidding. That was meant to be a feature, not a bug.

 That Rocky fell from his previous status as a rich guy was part of the very point the movie was making: that looks, health, career, and money don't always last, or they can be lost.

Another point the Rocky movies have made in about every film is that victory in life is not always tantamount to career, riches, and literally beating up another person.

In the course of this film, part V, Rockys son, Rocky Jr., feels estranged from his father, but by the end, theyve made up. That is a type of victory.

Not all victories in life involve gaining lots of money, fame, or sports cars. And thats fine.

--- ADRIAN: MORE IMPORTANT TO ROCKY THAN MONEY ----

The real treasures and riches in Rockys life are his son and his wife, Adrian.

As you will see if you watch Part 6 (entitled Rocky Balboa, which was released around 2006), Rockys wife, Adrian, eventually dies in her early 50s from cancer, and Rocky spends much of part 6 missing her.

Rocky visits Adrians grave-site regularly. He names a restaurant he owns after her.

Rocky clearly misses Adrian, and part 6 really drives home the point that the Rocky movies were, all along, really at its heart a love story  the Rocky movies were not predominantly an underdog story, a rags to riches story, or a boxing story, but a love story.

------- NEEDS MORE ADRIAN -----

One of my complaints of Rocky movies from part 3 to 5 is that the Adrian character somewhat fades from view.

Adrian may get a token scene in most Rocky movies, but she is in the background far too much, which is very odd, given how so very central she is to Rocky, his motivation, his happiness, and his psyche  and this is really emphasized in parts 2, 6, and strongly implied in part 1.

At any rate, money and fame are not all that matters to Rocky, so I don't see why Rocky fans complain so much about Rocky having to start over at square one in part 5.

One does not see Rocky moping around in part 6 missing his car, former mansion, fame or sports cars  its his wife who has passed away that he misses.

By part 6, Rockys relationship with his now-adult son, Robert Jr (aka Rocky Jr) is once more strained (the son eventually moves out of state in part 7, Creed). That his relationship with his son is strained bothers Rocky in part 6.

The Rocky sequels needed more scenes with Adrian, or Rocky interacting with Adrian.

I think it was a mistake on Stallone's part to lessen the Adrian character's presence in most of the sequels.

Adrian at least seemed to get a bit more on-screen time in part 5, but it was still amiss, in my view, because she didn't get great dialog.

In part 5, Adrian just mostly advised Rocky to be more involved with their son. I'm not sure how the Adrian scenes could have been improved in part 5, but they needed something more pr something better.

The Rocky character spent more time in part 5 focusing on boxing in general or on the Tommy Gunn character specifically, while the movie itself had a lot of scenes showing us Robert Jr (Rocky's son) being bullied at school.

----- VICTORY TAKES MANY FORMS -----

One point that part 5 (and other Rocky movies make) is that victory in life can come in many forms.

Victory does not always look like obtaining wealth, mansions, fame, and diamond rings.

Another message these movies convey is that fighting can come in many forms.

Fighting can mean fighting losing a relationship, fighting grief, fighting loneliness, or fighting cancer.

The boxing in the Rocky movies has always been an analogy for the game of life.

Fighting in life does not have to mean literally fighting a boxer with ones fists in a ring.
I am amazed at the number of Rocky fans (many of whom are probably over the age of 35 or 40 at this point, as of 2017, they are old enough to know better) who don't seem to grasp these concepts.

Such fans are overly literal, and demand to see Rocky in a ring beating up some guy in boxing gloves  but boxing is actually incidental to what the Rocky films are about at its heart.

--- BUSINESS IN THE FRONT, PARTY IN THE BACK ---

As to small details that annoyed me with Rocky part 5: Tommy the boxing guys mullet.

His blond mullet. So distracting.

Im not opposed that Stallone had a sub-plot involving his son, Rocky Jr, in this film, but I don't think it was carried out well.

Some fans quibble with the age of the son  at the end of part IV, the son was probably around 8 years old, but at the start of part V, he magically and mysteriously appears to be around 12.

(Part V is supposed to start right after part IV.)

Yes, that age leap is somewhat annoying or strange, but Im willing to put details like that aside to enjoy a movie.

As far as having a son sub-plot in the film:

Yes, fine, show us how Rockys son felt neglected by his dad  but the kid was a bit on the whiny, bratty side in the process of his teenage rebellion and angst, so the son character was annoying to watch through much of the film, and in another trivial detail that annoyed me: the ear ring the son wore.

Towards the end of the film, the kid, in an act of rebellion, started to wear what looked like one of his mothers dangling ear rings shed wear with an evening gown.

I hated that ear ring. I loathed that ear ring. It was also distracting.

The mullet on Tommy Gunn and the ear ring on the son needed to go.

------ ROCKY V SOUND TRACK -------

I don't care for most of the music sound track of Rocky V.

 I believe Rocky V is supposed to be set some time around 1985 or 1986, and yet, its obvious the film was released in the early 1990s (as it in fact it was), because by the late 1980s, rap music was making in-roads all over M-tv and in television commercials.

In the mid-1980s, (when part V is supposed to take place?),  however, rap music was not quite so prevalent.

It wouldve been more appropriate to have a sound track of mid-1980s hard rock, pop, or synth pop going on for Rocky V, such as works by Ratt, Billy Idol, The Police, Heart, Bon Jovi, George Michael, or Pat Benatar (or even more Survivor), or whatever other bands and singers were around in the mid-1980s  not rap music.

------ CLOTHING -----

Another minor quibble of mine with part 5 (and with some of the earlier sequels):

In parts 1  2, Rocky usually wore Levis jeans, t-shirts, converse sneakers, and maybe a hat with a leather jacket, but, by part 3, when hes a multi-millionaire, not only has he moved into a mansion, but hes now dressing like a preppy.

I can see the character wearing nice suits and such in public, to the ceremony where the city honors him with a statue, but, in the privacy of his own home? No.

Even in the privacy of his own home, Rocky is shown in part 3, and I think 4, strolling around in dress shirts under sweaters, wearing dockers slacks, and dress shoes.

By part 5, theres a scene, where, after Rocky has auctioned off his belongings because his brother in law Paulie lost all of Rockys money, he goes to the attic of the mansion to open an old box containing his old hat and leather jacket, which he takes to wearing again.

I find it somewhat implausible that a guy from a modest background such as Rocky who grew up on the streets would suddenly take to, in private, wearing dressy clothes - just because he now has millions.

I think it wouldve been more true for the character had he always worn the leather jacket (and t-shirts) around the big house, not stuffed it all away in a box in the attic until he lost that big house.

--- PART 5 FLAWED MOVIE BUT NOT AS BAD AS PART 4 ----

Rocky V is, in places, cheesy, but, it stands head and shoulders above Rocky IV in terms of character development.

Rocky V is not without its issues, but it at least tries to more faithfully represent the original Rocky movie in tone or character, which is what I am interested in concerning Rocky movies.

Ill take character development over pure spectacle (such as shown in Part IV) any day.

----- WHICH ROCKY MOVIES TO BUY OR WATCH -----

If youve never seen any of the Rocky movies, Id advise definitely seeing part 1, part 2, part 6, and maybe part 3.

Part 6, (the title for that is Rocky Balboa), is sad in tone, largely because Rocky is still dealing with missing Adrian and he seems lonely, but it is a quality Rocky sequel.

Feel free to skip Rocky parts 4 and 5 if you want to.

Ive not yet seen part 7 (entitled Creed), but most reviews say Creed is excellent, and the Rocky character is in part 7. Ive read there is supposed to be a Creed 2 in the works.

I suppose that Rocky V is ""skip-able"" if you choose to forgo it, but while part 5 has problems, I don't think its quite as bad as the fan boys of Rocky IV say it is.

I enjoy the Rocky franchise and do find it inspirational or uplifting most of the time and well worth a look, especially parts 1, 2, and 6.",1509062400,,13388,4.233832807570978

405439,1,6301982746,"Like any story worth telling in a series, both plausibility and continuity in character portrayal must be in check. Rocky V profoundly falls on it's face here from a script that Stallone himself has stated was admittedly sloppy and a project done for the paycheck - It glaringly shows.

Rocky V starts out with the first of many character inconsistencies. When Rocky leaves for Russia in part IV his son is no more than seven or eight. When Rocky returns in part V, his son has astoundingly grown to be a 15 or 16 year old! A lazy and reckless casting choice that completely discards continuity that was always closely followed in prior sequels, (especially where the story picks directly from the previous film).

Then the worst of all plot points is concocted -  Rocky loses his fortune from the dealings of a nameless, faceless attorney that is handled impossibly by...drum roll... Paulie? That's ridiculous. First of all, it completely falls out of continuity with the plot points from the previous film. In Rocky IV, Rocky and Paulie depart for Russia leaving Adrian behind. So from that standpoint alone, there is no reason for a power of attorney to be authorized since one of the primary owners are still residing there. Second, there is ABSOLUTE ZERO rationale that Rocky or Adrian would give Paulie legal say in a Power of Attorney arrangement given his instability depicted throughout the series. Rocky didn't even give him a job as a corner man until Rocky III. In addition, even if we didn't have those story and character inconsistencies, there is no legal precedent that even permits Paulie to have that responsibility to offer to an attorney since both Rocky and Adrian are of sound mind. So the legal plausibility is out the window.

And you know I've heard allot of people talk about how common it is for boxers of noted acclaim to lose their fortunes, like many popular athletes. That's true. The problem here is the writers didn't give Rocky a remotely believable scenario to dignify the character or his legion of fans who watched him climb the ladder and get to that position in a deserved way. So to take him down so quickly without a reason that even made sense was incredibly insulting. In truth, this was just a cheap and quickly written plot device because they wanted to ""reset"" the character since the original director, John Avildsen, was at the helm again...another gimmick.

If all of that was not disastrous enough, then we have Stallone offering one of the worst performances of his career in this role. To emote some form of ""brain damage"", Stallone makes the horrible decision to somehow walk back Rocky's dialect to a quality that borders on near parody of his character. Ladies and gentleman, this is not what brain damage looks like...unless you're the script writer. Then we might have a debatable subject here.

I would get into the rest of the film, but by this point, the story implausibilities, character inconsistencies, and general disconnect of what has come before in the series is so dreadfully violated, the remaining train wreck of a story involving Tommy Gunn is not remotely enough to redeem or otherwise reverse course on a series of impossibly bad decisions in the creation of this installment.

In closing, I would like to say the ONLY redeeming value in this film's existence is that Stallone WISELY backed off killing his character, which in turn paid him untold dividends later in life when he had to fight and scream to get one last installment made to redeem the series (and his career). So if allowing Rocky V to exist so that Rocky Balboa could be made, I will accept the film on that basis. But it's not because this film was any good. It's just that Stallone had to fall completely on his face before he understood how important this character truly was to people. He took those lessons and came back to make what is arguably one of the best installments in the series. That ultimately is the sad truth and legacy of Rocky V.",1471737600,3,3990,4.740634005763689

405531,5,6301982746,"Sylvester Stallone is, if anything, a writer of film plays worth considering. He may not be the best actor, sure, but he cornered the character of Rocky like no one else could and throws knockout performances each time he dons the trademark role that made him famous the world over. ROCKY V doesn't have the sensationalism of the fourth entry (or a syrupy climactic speech that makes you slide a hand over your eyes in recoil), but it does have a sad, sobering, but not truly depressing story--not truly depressing because, like Rocky says in the fourth one, we can't change who we are. Rocky started with small pay and big struggles, and so he ends up back in that same role. Clearly he couldn't handle the fame and fortune. It's depressing to see anyone take a financial fall, but Rocky is a survivor. ROCKY V returns Stallone to the role of the dramatist, and puts director Avildsen back into the director's chair. In many ways, ROCKY V contains the most positive message of all the Rocky movies, namely that money isn't everything, and that if you dummy up a little (like Rocky) to the reality of what it is that you've lost you can get by just fine. Mickey wasn't wealthy, and neither is Paulie or Adrian.
Apparently, the original script was a bit different, and the studio decisions to change it up showed real panic on the behalf of the studio, who feared that the ROCKY series was about ready to punch itself out. Stallone claims to have made the picture out of ""greed"" (the rhetoric in the late 80's was that ""greed is good,"" don't you know) but after viewing the film I can't help but feel that he was trying to return himself to the role of the respected Hollywood screenwriter. Critics have been unfair and unkind towards the film, but it is very engrossing and does return the ROCKY narrative to its roots and to its (supposed) conclusion. I have not yet viewed the film CREED, but I do have to say that ROCKY BALBOA, while I didn't dislike it per se, was almost absolutely pointless. By the time 1994 or 1995 rolled around, I think we had made peace with the fact that the ROCKY films had already climaxed. But apparently Stallone was working tirelessly behind the scenes on a continuation of the story for many years thereafter, and it wasn't until he found a producer who would hear him out that he finally managed to get Balboa back up and swinging again. But without Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, and especially the great Burgess Meredith, the ROCKY films just don't have the same heart, and that's a great shame indeed. ROCKY V has many great elements in it that the critics overlooked--the performance of Sage Stallone as Rocky's son (imagine that), the narrative interest generated by Rocky's dramatic personal and financial decline (and his ""brain damage""--which was intended to defer people from going headlong into boxing, since it really does smart), and especially the ostentatious performance of Richard Grant as George Washington Duke, whose Don King parody gives this film its true center, believe it or not. ROCKY V is downbeat drama, because we are watching a fall rather than a climb (Tommy's rise, for me, indicates more about Rocky's fall from life's true ambitions more so than it does the ""rise"" of some no account street punk, who plays the swine before Rocky's pearls). The fight choreography by wrestler Terry Funk is also pretty intense in Rocky's climactic street fight.
Considering the tragic and premature (heart attack) death of Stallone's son Sage Moonblood back in the summer of 2012, the really depressing part of ROCKY V is the rather shocking lack of extra content on the Blu-Ray disc. Why no audio commentary by Stallone discussing the box office receipts and the film's ultimate reception by critics and the public? Why no commentary by a historian? Since Tommy Morrison's bizarre death not long after (well, thirteen years, but still), one would think that ROCKY V would generate enough interest amongst fans to warrant a solid commentary track. A making of with interview footage would be better, though, since the original ROCKY movie has recently been released with some pretty neat extras about the making of the original movie. Though Stallone is limited as an actor, his heart is always in the right place. Still, this movie lost many fans of the series with its somber story, but these fans seemed to have forgotten that the original was a drama and not an action picture. The Blu-Ray has decent picture and sound, but it's not quite fantastic. It really needed restoration, but obviously the Blu-Ray company didn't want to put this kind of effort into this release. Maybe someday... When I was a kid watching this, it was pretty inspirational, and it remains an enjoyable story today--and, sadly, storytelling is just not what the American movies are good at anymore (partially because there are so few playwrights interested in working on movies any longer). This movie is your ruler when it comes to gauging the measure of a man. A-",1459987200,,4992,4.772254335260116

I know Sly wanted to make the most realistic Rocky yet and he succeded. You actually believe Tommy is his son and the street fights look more real and more action packed than in any other Rocky movie ever made. My mom and I both liked the family themes as well. This movie has Rocky trying to bond with Tommy while also trying to pay the bills and take care of his wife. ADRIAN!! Lol! That's right! Rocky has to pay the bills! He's not rich any more and Apollo isn't there to help him. That part is disappointing, it would have been nice to bring back Karl Weathers for this movie but I guess he wanted too much money. Oh well, that just leaves more room for new characters that you care about more. Some of them are at the ending, where Sly (as Rocky) overcomes his brain damage to fight his prodigy in an alley and finally knock him out after the two of them hit each other with trash cans and get rammed into a brick wall. After that Sly walks up to the bad guy who says ""Touch me and I'll sue."" Then he laughs and says it again. ""Touch me and I'll sue."" And Sly touches him all right. He punches right in the face!

I really don't get why Stallone wrote a Rocky movie that mainly consist in bringing Rocky the worst luck ever. I heard rumours that Stallone only wrote Rocky 5 because he just wanted to be through with Rocky. I also understand that Rocky 6 was made because Stallone though that Rocky 5 was way to depressing to be the conclusion.

I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 because the last scenes of the movie were pretty memorable, from the press scene with Tommy Gunn and Duke to the final street fight scene.

I saw Rocky V recently and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I first saw it in 1990. In fact I considered Rocky V the perfect ending for the Rocky saga. The next chapter, Rocky Balboa, was ok, but for me it was mostly nostalgia and it didn't generate any emotions in me. But Rocky V Wow! That movie hit all my emotions.
Rocky V broke the formula. Our hero loses all his money and has to go back to the neiborhood. Ashamed and humilliated.
Of course he is traumatized! Doctors told him he had brain damage and he couldn't fight his way out of this problem. He was on denial and he wanted to get it all back.
So when Tommy Gun shows up, he sees an oportunity. An oportunity that was stolen by the Duke. At the end of the movie, Rocky didn't get what he wanted. He failed. It is rare to see an American movie where the hero fails.
Rocky didn't get what he wanted, he got what he needed. Personal respect. By beating Tommy Gun on that amazing street fight Rocky became again the peoples champion.
Here is where Rocky V makes a perfect loop with the first Rocky movie. In that film it is established that Rockys motivation to fight Apollo is not money or to be the champion of the world. He just wanted to go the distance with Creed to prove to himself the he wasn't another bumb from the neiborhood. It is a personal victory. In fact, when the fight ends Rocky tells Apollo he doesnt need a rematch.
In Rocky V Adrian establishes that the difference between Rocky and Tommy is that Rocky always fought with his heart. Money and the championship were secundary. Passion drove Rocky through his carrier. But Tommy was hungry for money, the title and glamour.
The Duke said it perfect: Hey Rock, you have more class than him!
This are the main reasons why I love Rocky V.",1437609600,2,1780,4.238235294117647

Everything  goes  smoothly  for  a while.  Tommy  explains  to  Rocky  &  his  family  how  Tommy's  father  use  to  beat  on  him  &  his  mother.  &  that  he  never  really  thought  about  fighting  anyone  else  except  his  dad.  All  I  see  now  when  I  get  in  the  ring  is  him.  Some  people  will  say  that's  one  way  to  get  rid  of  your  hatred  or  a  troubled  past,  &  try  to  amount  to  something.  Rocky  also  had  good  advice  for  his  son  when  he  escorted  him  to  school,  Don't  mess  with  nobody's  girlfriend,  simply  another  word  for  staying  out  of  trouble.  &  a  couple  of  bullies  didn't  like  him  too  much  because  he's  Rocky  Bal Boa's  son.  &  they  take  away  his  lunch  money  &  jacket.  Then  he  eventually  whips  one  of  the  bullies,  then  they  become  friends  with  Rocky Jr.  He  &  his  dad  start  drifting  apart,  &  he  starts  to  doubt  that  his  dads  got  time  for  him  anymore.
Tommy  gets  to  be  a  good  fighter  &  is  getting  put  on  magazine  covers,  but  not  yet  making  any  serious  money  which  he  gets  upset  about.  Duke  sees  a  perfect  opportunity  to  screw  Rocky  Bal Boa  in  the  worst  way,  &  steals  Tommy  from  Rocky.  Tommy  begins  to  listen  to  Duke  more  than  Rocky.  He  did  get  side winded  by  Duke,  What  bothered  me  a  little  bit,  is  why  is  that  Tommy  Gunn  didn't  see  that  Duke  was  taking  him  down  the  wrong  path?  Meanwhile  Rocky Junior  has  turned  his  back  on  his  dad  &  is  smarting  off  &  stuff.  Rocky  is  a  good  father  &  is  very  patient.  He's  not  the  hollering  type  or  nothing.  His  wife  finally  tells  Rocky  to  forget  about  Tommy,  if  theirs  something  you  want  to  pass  on  pass  it  on  to  your  son.  So  he  does  not  continue  to  go  in  the  wrong  direction.  &  it  would  have  gotten  to  the  point  where  it  was  too  late,  or  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  change  him.  Rocky  finally  sets  things  straight  with  him.

Duke  tells  Tommy Gunn  after  he  gets  mocked  by  the  people  after  his  fight  with  Kane  theirs  a  way  to  get  the  respect  you  deserve.  You  must  fight  Rocky  Bal Boa,  his  mentor!  Young  lion  against  old  lion!  Duke  gives  Tommy  a  20'000  dollar  advance  a  new  car,  &  a  fake  girlfriend,
Soon  Rocky  &  Tommy  are  fighting  it  out  in  the  street.  Where  they  fight  with  no  gloves  bare fisted!!
Rocky  wins  though  holding  onto  his  position  as  champion,  showing  everybody  that  his  reign  as  champion  will  never  die!  When  you  join  forces  with  someone  like  Duke  your  only  a  paper  champion,
Let  me  just  put  it  this  way,  you  get  isolated  from  getting  to  the  top  the  right  way.  By  the  way  I  like  the  reruns  through  the  other  Rocky  movies.  I  didn't  think  there  was  ever  going  to  be  another  sequel.  People  I  think  I'd  skip  Rocky  6  entitled  Rocky  Boa  if  I  were  you!
At  the  end  Rocky  repays  Duke  for  what  he  did  steeling  Tommy  Gunn  &  turning  him  against  him,  Duke  gets  the  tar  knocked  out  of  him,  Sue  me  for  what  Rocky  says?  That  right  there  is  worth  a  good  laugh!  Thanks  to  Adrian's  advice  Rocky  was  too  smart  for  Duke!",1431561600,,4943,4.168734491315137

406196,4,6301982746,"I looked in every local movie store near my home address, but it barely turns up everywhere unlike the other films in the ""Rocky"" series. I was glad to be able to find it here on amazon. I've heard people say that it's not exactly the BEST film in the ""Rocky"" series, but to me, it wasn't good, but not bad. It was alright. It had a few good points in the film, such as the scenes with Mickey Goldmill saying ""GET UP, you son of a gun. 'Cause Mickey loves you, and I realize that a street fight was what made ""Rocky V"" unusual, compared o the other films, but if you think about it, there was already a long line of fight scenes that took place in a boxing ring, so with that in mind, I thought one street fight out in the intersection of Adrian's pet shop, the ""Lucky Seven"" tavern, ad Mighty Mick's boxing gym would make a good conclusion to the long series of fights. Not to mention having the street fight take place at night. Of course this WAS before ""Rocky Balboa"" in 2006. Don't get me wrong, I DID say that most people say that the street fight was an unusual thing, and that was why people hated the film. But again, aside from the ""son getting neglected by his father"" subplot, this film wasn't that bad. I actually received an average kind of entertainment from it.

406287,2,6301982746,"Rocky V has Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago. After their fortune being squandered by their accountant,Rocky and his family find themselves moving back to Philadelphia as a working class family and finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey. Resisting big money offered to him to fight in the ring, Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn. Added to that story is the tension in the relationship between Rocky and his son,Rocky Jr.

A lot of Rocky fans just hated this film. Even Sylvester Stallone disowns this film. It just lost the underdog theme which has kept the Rocky saga afloat for so many years. The fact that the Balboas return to their old Philadelphia neighborhood is the only thing new in this film. Although it tries to recapture the original Rocky spirit with this,it failed in its purpose miserably. The concept of Rocky as a boxing coach and mentor simply fails as many fans would rather see him fight inside the ring against a formidable opponent rather than become a trainer. Obviously,the street fight between him and Tommy Gunn just does not simply work as it looked out of place. The only thing I could say is good thing that Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI)  was released to make up for a worthwhile conclusion of the saga.",1408147200,,1362,4.670833333333333

For those who don't know , the Tommy character in this movie is the actual professional boxer Tommy Morrison and the stories mentioned by him are true. He was on his way to becoming a legend and had a brutal left hook that many pro boxers lamented. His heavy partying and loose morals took a toll on his boxing and soon left him with HIV forcing his withdrawal from boxing at a young age. Later in life he tried to make a comeback( denying his AIDS) but soon died at age 44 I believe.

This begins in Moscow, Rocky fights a Soviet boxer. [The continuation from the last movie.] No holds barred? Rocky wins again. [Was ths a surprise?] Adrienne talks to him. Rocky just wants to go home. His son greets him. Rumors about complications? Doctors say boxing should be banned. Rocky agrees, doctors should stay out of the ring! Will Rocky retire? Has he changed? Rocky Racoon? What about that Power of Attorney given to his accountant? All the money is gone! [Bad investments?] Who is to blame? The doctors diagnose irreversible brain damage. He cant be licensed in any state. [Note the two warnings in these scenes.] Rockys estate is auctioned off, what will it net? Rocky visits Mighty Micks gymnasium and remembers the past. Rocky moves back to his old neighborhood. Welcome back! G. W. Duke calls Adrienne about a chance; he is refused. His son goes to school. A promoter talks about another fight. Hes done fighting!

Rockys son Robert has trouble in school. Does the new boxer use a head gear? Is he too aggressive? Tommy Gunn wants another chance. Rockys son wants to learn how to box to defend himself. [A lesson here, even when two against one.] You have to learn how to control fear, says Rocky. Robert is robbed again. [Note the barbed wire on top of that brick wall, like in East Berlin.] Rocky manages Tommy, his advice works. Tommy advances, Robert practices and applies his knowledge in the real world. Tommy keeps on winning. He fights in Las Vegas and wins. That promoter talks to Tommy about a new deal. Robert is growing up. Or is it jealousy? G. W. Duke brings Tommy home, then he leaves. Watching the parade go by?

Tommy will sign a contract to get a title shot. Rocky is disappointed. Is he losing his family? When did Robert start smoking? Tommy gets his promised fight in Las Vegas and wins. An upset victory? Gunn thanks Duke, not Rocky. Who is disappointed? Reporters criticize this fight. Are they justified? Or is this just a way to sell newspapers? Duke advises Tommy to challenge Rocky for another fight. [Will this sell a lot of tickets and exploit these boxers?] Gunn challenges Rocky to a fight in public. [Note the presence of the camera.] Rocky still has what it takes. But Gunn isn't through yet. One more round. It goes on until one man cant stand. Sue me for what? The crowd cheers Rocky and Robert run up the stairs to that Philadelphia museum. [Is this the end of the series?]

The original Rocky was like a morality play for America battered by the Ford recession. This movie is like the retrospection of a man past middle age; he realized he reached a plateau. His best is in the past. This is a good story that tells about the fight business. Are young boxers built up to encourage fans and bettors only to soon burn out? They say there are no fixed fights anymore. Is that because boxing is dying out (like many movie theaters or minor league sports)?",1401753600,,2925,4.597701149425287

406407,3,6301982746,"Note: I saw this film in HD via XFinity On Demand.

Written around 3 years after ROCKY IV, ROCKY V picks up immediately after the triumphant fourth film. Unfortunately, it staggers like a sottish man in several spots, notably in the training/fight/climax sequences. This sequel barely felt like a true ROCKY film in the music department, with the crap rap noise that tries very lamely to pass itself off as 'music' instead of the true music by Bill Conti/Vince DiCola that is an integral part of the franchise.

Since Mr. Avlidsen released a Director's Cut of the film online about 14 years ago, I have a feeling that this sequel was taken over by the studio and re-edited against Mr. Avlidsen's wishes. I feel that, had Mr. Stallone directed the movie, it would have come out a real winner, like the other five movies in the franchise. The Director's Cut includes several scenes that do not appear in the theatrical cut, including a scene with Little Marie, who is now a whore, as Rocky predicted she would end up if she kept on hanging with the wrong sort of people, in the first film, a beautiful love scene between Rocky and Adrian, with music from the first film, music from the fourth film is used during the training/fight/training montages (some of which are fully fleshed out scenes in the Director's Cut), and most importantly, music from the first film intercut with Rocky remembering his fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T.) and seeing a hallucination of Mickey during the climax. I personally think that if some things from the theatrical cut had been combined with the Director's Cut, it would have been a much better film instead of the mixed bag it turned out to be.

The Director's Cut of the film is available for viewing on YouTube. See both versions, and decide for yourself which one is better.",1394928000,2,1811,4.688679245283019
406408,2,6301982746,"I went into this knowing most consider this to be the worst Rocky and ultimatly they were proven right. This movie did have good intentions showing us the reverse of the previous movies where Rocky is insiperational to other characters instead of them motivating him. Also the storyline between Rocky and his son was a good idea, helped since it actually was Stallone's son.

However this movie possess many flaws. The continuity between it and previous movies is wrong in some areas, Rocky going into bankruptcy was pretty contrived, I didn't really feel sorry for Rocky (but I did for everyone else close to him), the villains of the movie felt stupid and the final fight didn't not feel intense at all.

406539,5,6301982746,"The concept of ""Rocky V"" is the real life tale of many celebrities and athletes. This movie has fared bad reviews, and critics look at it negative since it departed from the Rocky III/IV storylines of ""war in the ring"", but it's a reality type of film. How many times do we see a sports athlete or movie stars go from rags to riches than rags again? We see it often especially in American Football. This film displayed the honesty of this reality. Instead of Rocky riding off into the sunset as a super rich near-action figure boxing hero, Rocky finds that bad decisions and management, his now inability to participate in his sport, and his lack of education outside of his sport has put him (now broke) back onto the same streets he came from with only the South Philadelphia house his brother-in-law kept from their street living days. We also see Rocky return to his roots where his ""true"" friends welcome him home and don't abandoned him now the money is gone. Rocky III and IV went more action hero (ie Rocky taking on an Uber-Drago in Rocky IV), and Rocky V brought it back into the reality of where Rocky I and II left off. Tommy Gunn the up and comer whom Rocky takes under his wing, only to have Gunn betray Rocky when the money and fame start coming in (for Gunn) is another element you see in real life and sports. I like the final fight as it takes the fight out of the ring and into the street showing that street smarts is just as important as ring (or book) smarts. For me it's Rocky I, Rocky II, and Rocky V that are my three favorites that I watch. I usually skip Rocky III and Rocky IV as they got a little more 80s action figurish and the ""heart of the underdog"" tone was semi-gone although they are still great films. Don't shy away from this film because the story line is different or because it faces reality that hits a lot of fallen sports stars. This should be the film that every wild spending new football stars must watch as it speaks a tone of ""be careful or you'll end up back in the gutter that you started in"". As for the complaints about rap music in this film instead of ""Eye of the Tiger"" or ""Gonna Fly Now"". The soundtrack music was fitting the music of this films time period (1989-1991) and very much appropiate. Just like we found disco in Rocky I and II (You Take My Heart Away by Shirley Bassey in Rocky I, and All of My Life by Shirley Bassey in Rocky II both late 1970s disco songs), and the 1980s rock music found in Rocky III and IV, rap fits fine with Rocky V and its more of a workout ""get tough"" type rap music like ""Go For It"" by Joey B. Ellis . You must watch Rocky I and II with full attention to understand the meaning of Rocky V. The reality of life is that sometimes when all is said and done, we end up back where we started from, no matter how much we gain and than lose in between it all. Don't miss out on Rocky V!

I have loved the Rocky movies since I was a child, so when the fifth came out I remember being excited to see it... And I hated it!  Fast-forward twenty-ish years (oh dear, am I that old?) and I owned five of the six Rocky movies and loved them, LOVED them, but still refused to even watch Rocky V, let alone add it to my collection.  My husband, who'd never seen any of them until I made him watch them, wanted to give it a chance so he could at least know the complete storyline.  I am SO HAPPY I listened to him and gave it another chance.  This movie explored the relationship between Rocky and his son, and parallel to that, Rocky and his new protoge, who started to take the place of Rocky's son in his heart.  How sad is that??  Watching it again, the things that bothered me so much the first time (Rocky's climactic fight taking place in the street instead of the ring, and, stupidly enough, the music.  Can I blame it on my youth?) mattered not at all because I felt the heart of the man fighting for his self-respect.

406710,5,6301982746,"Stallone has made a career of writing movies with terrible dialogue and blunt transitions, but this may be his finest work.  Love clichs, this movie has them in spades.  Don King caricature check, soulless temptress who lures naive protagonist into an antagonist role check, rebellious teen check, reluctant hero check.  As referenced by the title of this review, I find that this movie is so awful that it transcends drama/action and moves into comedy.

Spoiler alert, I'm going to reveal plot lines to give examples of the awesomeness of the movie, nay film. Nuance does not exist in the fifth installment of the Rocky series as evidenced by the 15 minutes of the film where he goes from humbled and broke family man to teacher who is also a neglecting father back to a simpleton who listens to his wife.  There's a point at which Rocky's head is ringing because of brain trauma suffered from years of boxing which Adrian soothes them by putting a coat on him.  What?!  Quit paying your neurologist and head over to the nearest department store everybody.  My absolute favorite aspect of the movie is that Stallone/Rocky calls his son in the movie (and in real life) ""kid"" the entire picture except when in a heated exchange where the kid walks out on him, he calls him Adrian.  I of course, watched through to the credits to see that the kid's name was Rocky Jr.  Calling the kid Jr. Through the film was too tall an order?  Sprinkle in a soundtrack with '80s songs and an auto-fellatio scene at the end that is shot at the scene of the Rocky statue in Philly and you've got one terribly awesome movie.",1351036800,,1605,4.5964912280701755
406711,5,6301982746,"Going into my first viewing of this film a while back, I had relatively low expectations for the film. I would have been happy with it had it been completely bland and average. Yet what I found was a compelling chapter in the history of Rocky. Now, I will admit, it is easily the black sheep of the six Rocky films and I can completely understand why some people didn't enjoy it as much as the other entries. Yet to me, this was a mandatory bridge between Rocky IV and Balboa (the highly acclaimed final film of the series) even though at the time of filming, Sly thought V would be the final story told. Not only does it guide us through the aftermaths of the most brutal Rocky fight ever against the roided machine of a man Ivan Drago but it gives us glimpses into the mind of a man who's slowly moving past his prime physically but not mentally or emotionally. In fact, most of the fighting in this film is between Rocky and himself and doesn't need a training montage or a smack talking opponent with 24 pack abs to make it compelling.

Stallone clearly wanted to bring this film full circle and try to connect it with the original. After Rocky returns home from Russia with a few less brain cells that were beaten out of him by Drago, he finds that his brother-in-law made some bone headed financial decisions and they've now lost most of their fortune. This forces Rocky, his wife and young son to move back to his original stomping grounds in Philly. It's an unpleasant change of scenery most notable for Rocky's kid (who managed to age about half a decade in six weeks but we'll get back to that later.) and this, along with Rocks own insecurity and his budding relationship with a now apprentice Tommy Gunns, this all leads to the deterioration of the Balboa home. An alienated son, and a wife (albeit a little unsupportive at times) who fears her husband will lose all he has left, to recapture something he can never hold again. At the center of all of this, the new apprentice, the loss of money, the family breaking, the pain of losing his mentor Mick and his former rival turned best friend Apollo Creed is Rockys fear. The fear that he can't give up fighting, or support his family, the fear for his health his intelligence and sanity. The fear that he's being completely consumed by the losses that he has had to face. That right there is what I believe to be the staple of the film. FEAR. As Stallone explains during a scene, either you control your fear and it allows you to take yourself to the next level, or it consumes you and you burn down everything in your life. As the film continues, we see how both Rocky and Tommy each have to deal with the issue of fear and which side each one of them comes down on.

Again, i'd like to give a disclaimer, this is not your average Rocky film. There is no smooth and smack talking opponent. No tank of a man who killed someone Rocky cared about and now he must destroy him for it. The build-up we would normally find is non existence and instead of the confrontation between opponents having a slow build, like a forest fire destroying acres of land slowly. It's like a brutal house fire, starting unexpectedly and devouring everything in its path before turning to smoke among the ashes. Also, Sly and co. manage to ""trim the fat"" that slightly plagued certain aspects of III & IV (two films I love dearly. You will not find any of the oddball and sometimes unnecessary charm that appeared in those two films. You will find no overplayed soundtracks, used solely to play long winded montage scenes of Rocky running on the beach in slow motion. Nor is there a robot butler. In fact i still scratch my head at that aspect of Rocky IV. As I said before, Sly wanted to take us back in time to the first two films, especially the first. People were losing faith in Rocky as he wallowed through the slums of his hometown and that's what this film again is able to portray in the series. A lot of the grit of the series returns, while simultaneously trying to pull the series in a new direction, the reaction seems mixed, even by Stallone himself but I think it was a turning point in the franchise, as i look back and see all the pieces.

When I hear people complain about the direction of the film, or anything of that nature my first response is always the same, ""What do you expect?"" I love Rocky IV and watch it religiously and I will stand by the idea that the Rocky V. Ivan fight was the most brutal in the history of the series. Those two men beat the piss out of each other in a barbaric nature. Did you expect Rocky to just pick himself up and move on like nothing ever happened? The first five minutes of this film really show the post Drago fight with incredible honesty and dignity. Even though Rocky won, it nearly killed him. So to have this film have been another high profile fight with a towering opponent would have been too much for me. At the very least in this film the cast and crew still show love for the series by trying to push it into a new direction.

NOW, to finally address some negatives that people don't seem to really care for much in the series. The kid managed to grow quite a bit while the family was in Russia, eh? Maybe my love of the film helps brush off this odd aspect of the film but I figure that Stallone really wanted his son involved in the film and personally I can't blame the guy for wanting that. It doesn't hurt that father/son relationships play such a big role in the film, be it Rock and the kid or Tommy and his abusive father. So being that he was probably writing this script and thinking about his own son, why not have his own son in the actual film? i know it's not much of a defense but it's all I got and I did knock off 0.5 from my final score because of it. Also, the action is a little lacking compared to other films, there's not the major triumphant of the first two films or the horrible circumstances Rock must overcome like in III and IV but that's not what this film is about. The film is about Rocky and himself he doesn't need to fight the guy at the beginning because he has nothing to prove and the reason he fights at the end is for himself, not money, fame or anybody else. Which finally brings me to the final fight, no it was not in front of thousands of screaming fans in a packed arena. It's in an alley, it's on the streets with only people built from the same concrete as Rock, it's a huge metaphor for the entire film and is a huge plus, not a major negative for me.

Lastly but obviously not least, the greatest aspect of this film for me is the flashbacks of Mick and how they keep Rocky alive throughout. The man really was Rocky's guardian angel because at every turn in the film, when he's down or about to be beaten, he goes back to thoughts of his mentor and the advice he gave him and it gives him that final push. It brings them full circle and shows the beauty of the father/son relationship that they had formed. It proved that Tommy was broken and he broke off something that could have been great for the sake of money and people who didn't really care about. He went down the road Rocky promised him he shouldn't go down and it would lead him to down a dark path.

In conclusion, this film has heart in every possible aspect and it shows Rocky overcoming his biggest obstacle, his own fear and self doubt. I implore you, regardless if you're a longtime fan of Rocky or a first time viewer. Watch this film with an open mind and I can guarantee you will find something to love.",1346544000,,7533,4.297677691766362

This forces him to go back to the beginning and basically come back from nothing to the point he wants to be at.

Eventually, the boxer that Rocky took a shine to turned and him and his son was able to overcome his adversity as well, but now the son is upset with his father as he feels abandoned by his dad when he really needed his father there.

And while i am defending Rocky V,i have to say Balboa really capped the series on a high note. In my opinion every Rocky is a great Rocky this one included.",1331510400,6,894,4.114285714285714

12/05: Rocky V is a nice resurgence back to the top form of Rocky series. It is mostly due to the reason of John G. Avildsen taking up the helm of directing instead of Sylvester Stallone. One touching scene is shown between Rocky and Mickey in the old gym. The acting is much improved this time with an excellent supporting role of George Washington Duke, a Don King wanna-be, played by Richard Gant. What I like about this fifth part is how Stallone was able to make Rocky to go back to his old roots, act the usual Rocky, and bring some new issues rather than play the same tired formula. The street fight adds a new dimension for the series, making Rocky as a street-fighter. Moreover, John G. Avildsen is able to bring more intensity, not found in the past two movies, in the issues between Rocky and Tommy and at the same time with his family than into the motivation build-up prior to big fights. It is a nice acting job by Tommy Morrison. I really enjoy this movie a lot better than the 3rd and 4th parts, although failing to meet the standards of Rocky II, let alone the very first movie.

7/11: For a while, I've always thought Rocky V to be the black sheep of the series. It just doesn't quite fit in. After seeing it again, I appreciate it more, and it is a nice break from the same cliched plot. A lot of people has noticed the dramatic change in the son, especially in puberty growth, but I actually like Sage much more than the cartoon unrelated boy from previous part. He looks and plays the part well. The best performance among the cast is obviously Richard Gant who plays the Don King clone. One thing to like about the film is the skillful editing. And another was the recapture of the old Rocky acting style by Sylvester Stallone. That is sorely missed in the past two films. He is really good in it. Anyway, I am looking more forward to the final part since it is obviously one of the best films of the series. I am raising the rating of the film from `6' to `7'.",1311811200,,2020,4.299212598425197

Of all the parts in the Rocky films this is probably the most depressing.  Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad movie.

406812,5,6301982746,"I've been extremely skeptical to rewatch Rocky 5.  The reason being, everyone says it's nowhere near as good as the previous four.  I originally watched this film when it first came out, but haven't had a chance to rewatch it until now (actually I didn't have any desire to see it again until now).

Well, I'm an adult now, and I can appreciate films a lot better than I did 20 years ago, so approaching this film with an open mind, the million dollar question is, how does Rocky 5 stand up to the previous Rocky classics?  Honestly, it's almost on the same level of quality and storytelling.

The ONLY negative thing I can find with Rocky 5 is that the fight scene that takes place at the end has almost entirely NO build-up whatsoever.  It just happens rather suddenly, and as quickly as it comes, it's over with.  *This* is probably the only disappointing moment in the entire movie, but the rest of the film does a brilliant job focusing on Rocky training a new guy, and dealing with family issues as well.

Actually his son puts on a great acting performance by starting off like a nerd who doesn't even know how to defend himself when a couple young boys give him a hard time by punching him and stealing his things, then becoming smarter and stronger through lots of training and eventually coming back to kick some school bully behind!

The majority of the film however, deals with a young kid from Oklahoma visiting Philadelphia that seems to be in dire need of needing immediate training to become a boxer, and is very insistent on Rocky being his trainer.

With Rocky's help, the kid elevates all the way to the top of the division... but as he continues winning and winning, he develops an arrogant attitude, hangs around the wrong people, and eventually this leads to a final showdown with Rocky himself.

I honestly thoroughly enjoy Rocky 5, and I recommend everyone watch it.  Don't be surprised if you end up loving it just as much as the rest of the Rocky films.",1269648000,4,1979,4.52808988764045

406883,3,6301982746,"I believe I was Sage Stallone's age when Rocky V first came out. I've seen all the Rocky films and I am a big Stallone fan. I know the history of Rocky and seeing all the Rocky movies I think I can fairly say that critics and fans are bias against this installment.

The claim is that Rocky V was unrealistic and a let down as a film ending. If you ask me the Rocky movies should have stopped at Rocky 2 or at Rocky because it went downhill each sequel. Rocky 2 was BORING. Rocky 3 was fairly entertaining and Rocky 4 stunk to high heaven. Stallone acted like he was bored in Rocky 4! Rocky V is a decent sequel compared to the others. It's no worse than 3 or 4 so it makes you wonder why people hate on it so much.

Some say it's not true to the story of Rocky. Bullcrap. Rocky V pissed folks off because it took Rocky back to the beginning. People loved the ""rags to riches"" angle and that's why Rocky became such a success. He was the underdog who always won. I admired Rocky V because it was the only time Rocky seemed to remember where he came from after making it big. In Rocky 3 and 4 Rocky didn't even act like he knew what the streets were, let alone that he'd grown up there. There was no evidence of the original Rocky in either of those sequels. Maybe Stallone made part five to instill some reality back in the character because the Rocky in 3 and 4 acted nothing like the original Rocky. He not only became more educated but he acted like a totally different person with no common sense.

People complained about the rap music. Hello it was 1990!  Eye of the Tiger will forever be one of Rocky's known songs but why someone would expect Eye of the Tiger to be the theme of a film from 1990 (an entirely different era than when Survivor made the song) is beyond me and ridiculous! The Rocky films have been made over a period of thirty years! The rap music and other changes in Rocky V were true to what was happening then. In 1990 rap music ruled the charts and that's just how it was. But why such a big deal about the damn music? I think it's another evidence of people nickpicking because they weren't happy with this installment. Tough.

As for the street fight thing, it didn't matter to me because it was still entertaining. Rocky V was interesting and lacked the dull moments of Rocky 4, which in my opinion was the worst, silliest and most boring of the Rocky movies! Maybe it's the fact that 5 was supposed to be the end that got folks so riled up but either way, this film isn't as horrible as some claim. Most of the negativity comes from the disappointment from people who didn't like how Stallone ended things. Well not only is there Rocky Balboa but Stallone's contemplating making a seven so those folks should now be happy. I think he should have quit at the first Rocky. Even though I've enjoyed some of the sequels, they were never as good as the first.

Of course Rocky V is far from perfect. Stallone goes too far with ""the past"". The part where Rocky starts wearing the same clothes as he did in the first film was silly. I don't think he could have still worn the same clothes in 1990 that he wore in 1976. I also don't think he would have kept those clothes all that time. Who keeps clothes that long? Also the part about Adrienne and her glasses was silly too. Why would she keep glasses from all those years and then didn't even remember she had? And why did she stop wearing her glasses in the first place? She wore them in the first Rocky then all of a sudden never put them back on. I also don't think they needed to go back to the same area they used to live. Just because they were broke doesn't mean they would go back to the old neighborhood. I think Rocky would have been way too embarrassed to go back there after what happened to him. Adrienne talks about going back to work at the pet store??? You mean to say that pet store would still be around? It was too bad they never gave Adrienne a life outside of Rocky. This woman has been married to this man for decades at this point and she has never learned to do anything other than work at the pet store? Please. It also made no sense that Rocky and Adrienne put up with Paulie after what he did. Another silly thing was that Rocky had started acting like a Harvard graduate when he was rich and famous then all of a sudden when he's broke again he's dumb as a brick again? WTF?

I recommend Rocky V if you can accept that people and things change and grow with age. It's not perfect but no movie is. With each era came a different Rocky movie and a different Rocky so people can't expect time to stand still. Each film was supposed to be different. My main complaint was that Rocky V didn't have Apollo Creed who died in 4 which was stupid! Carl Weathers was Rocky's best nemesis and I think Rocky V would have rocked if Apollo and Rocky had to step back into the ring and battle each other. So much for wishful thinking.

Meredith Burgess didn't die until 1997 so why he was killed off in Rocky 3 I have no idea! The lost of Mickey and Apollo is when Rocky should have ended forever.",1262390400,,5084,4.201844262295082

Stallone's real life son is a terrible actor and is one of the reasons this film is the worst in the series. Overall the formula keeps you watching and the film is entertaining if you don't think about it too long.

The DVD transfer on my edition is OK, but there is room for improvement.

406892,4,6301982746,"I love Rocky 5 and I'm not afraid to admit it!  This movie has been dumped on for years by critics and fans, but I feel that's all rather harsh.  It may not be the best film, but it's nowhere near as bad as it's reputation makes it out to be.  When you talk to someone about the Rocky series, people always tend to like them all ""except for Part 5, that was stupid"".  So where did all this hatred come from?  Could be a number of things, but I think it has a lot to do with the number 5.  When you get to the point of having a 5 slapped on after the film's title, it's usually not a good thing.  Part 5s are reserved for Friday The 13s, Nightmare On Elm Streets and Police Academys, not Rocky movies.  I think the film may have been conceived as a joke before many folks even saw it, especially since Rocky 4, while an entertaining movie, started delving into the ridiculous.  And I think most people went into this film while in the mindset of, ""this is a bad movie"".  Maybe it just wasn't the right time and people weren't wanting another Rocky film.
But when you think about it, it's actually a good movie, kind of a downer, but life can certainly be a downer, even in Rockyland.  It's a little more down to earth.  Rocky loses his money and is forced to move back to his old neighborhood.  Brain damage from the fight with Drago has now made it so he can't fight anymore, yet he's constantly harassed by boxing promoter George Washington Duke(a thinly disguised portrayal of Don King) to make a big comeback in a fight with the #1 contender.  Adrian returns to her old job and Rocky reopens Mickey's gym.  Young boxer Tommy Gunn befriends Rocky looking for his big shot at becoming a pro.  Rocky agrees to manage and train him, thus shunning his son who is trying hard to adjust to this different lifestyle.  Family conflicts galore!!  Then the slimy Duke, still trying to get Rocky into the ring, gets his claws into Tommy.  Tommy gets a taste of money and success and soon becomes sick of being referred to as Rocky's ""robot"", and decides to earn his respect by pushing Rocky to fight.  Of course we all know that it all ends in a cool street brawl.
This film strayed from the formula of the last two films.  It now put Rocky in the role of Mickey training a hungry young boxer like he once was.  Rocky acts more like Rocky in this film.  We all noticed that after part 2, Rocky's personality changed.  He wasn't the childlike, slightly punchy and lovable dope anymore, but seemed like the kind of character Stallone played a lot of in the 80s.  It's nice to see Rocky in his old clothes and hat acting like Rocky(he even starts smoking again!), even if it doesn't really make sense why he went from upper class hoity toity back to how he was before.
One flaw I certainly found in this film was the character of Tommy Gunn, or maybe it's real life boxer Tommy Morrison's performance.  You're supposed to like him in the beginning and view him as a kind of second generation Rocky, but you never like the guy.  I certainly didn't anyhow.  He never comes across as a very likable or sympathetic character, even when telling a sob story about an abusive father.  Gunn's a necessary character to the story, but a lousy one(but again, that could just be Morrison's performance).
Often(always)overlooked is the performance of Richard Gant who plays the evil G. W. Duke.  This guy has got the fast talking, hustling schtick of Don King down awesomely.  He's easily one of the best aspects of the movie.  When ever I see Gant in other films, I immediately think, ""Hey!  It's Duke!""
I tend to hear people whine about Rocky's son, played by Sly's real life son, Sage Stallone.  A lot of folks think he's annoying, but I don't have a problem with him.  Sage grew up to start the company Grindhouse Releasing.  So look at it this way, Sage is the reason we have Cannibal Holocaust on DVD here in the states, so I think the entire U.S. should owe a debt of gratitude.
So in the end I'm basically saying that Rocky 5 has always been unfairly labeled as a dreadful film.  I never said it was a great film(I just said I loved it), but if you feel particularly ballsy, you might want to catch it again.  You might...just might...be surprised.",1232841600,3,4231,4.376923076923077

But his comfortable retirement is likewise cut short when the accountant Paulie hired absconds with all their money, and they have to move back to the old neighborhood. A slick fight promoter nags him to return to the ring, and he resists, but sees a way to recover some of his glory when a young boxer asks Rocky to train him.

Rocky gets so caught up in the training that he neglects his family, and his son gets in trouble, and then everything is solved by a quick father/son chat and a fistfight outside a bar.

Mostly, it was boring. The beginning of the movie was just flashback after flashback of the previous movies, interspersed with repeated nagging from the promoter and incessant reminders that if he fights, he'll die. Adrian was her usual annoying, whiny self, and Paulie was more useless than ever. The son (who was several years older than he was in the previous movie--presumably because he's played by Sage Stallone) was unrealistic.

There was quite a lot of unrealized potential in the movie. If some of those interminable flashbacks from the first half and training montages from the second had been cut, there might have been time to develop a more realistic conflict resolution with the son, and a more meaningful climax to the movie than a fistfight.

If it weren't for the fact that Rocky I-IV are so stupendous (with Rocky IV being simply one of the best action movies of all time), this could have really hurt Sylvester Stallone's career.

Rocky IV left us with the champ just getting through the fight of his life against Russian behemoth with hammers for fists and enough chemical enhancements to drop a horse.  Not only that, but Rocky was taking on a cold-war powerhouse, an entire country, and communism as a whole.  He was crazy-busy.  It's a good thing he signed over power of attorney to Paulie for all those pesky multi-million dollar financial details.

Meanwhile, Adrian never double-checked the finances on her gravy train - because she was too busy harping at Rocky - and lets Paulie squander the Balboa fortune faster than MC Hammer could have.  Soon Rocky has moved back into the slums of Philly, can't fight because of a brain tumor - which is not shocking at all considering his fighting style, and has been relegated to training an up-and-coming boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrisson) in Mickey's old gym.  During the training, Rocky treats Tommy like a surrogate son while neglecting his own son.  Speaking of his son, this is one of my biggest problems with Rocky V.

In Rocky IV he was like six years old, a believer in Santa and the Easter Bunny, but just a few days later in Rocky V he's damn-near growing a mustache.  Either there is a huge plot hole, or the kid's part werewolf.

Exactly how long was Rocky in Russia?

Much like her son, Adrian (Talia Shire) is also a horrible character.  She once again seems to hate the fact that Rocky is a boxer, telling him that he can't win, that he's washed up, that he's going to die - just like she has done in seemingly every previous Rocky movie.  She sure doesn't seem to be bothered by the furs, the fancy cars, the means to buy someone a robot, the jewelry, her ginormous house, or her plastic surgery throughout the years.

She's yet again the Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, the Zander Barcalow from Starship Troopers - the character who doesn't help the movie's plot, and creates forced sexual drama or a love triangle where it is not needed or wanted.  In fact, I think we can all blame Adrian's character for creating the ""pointless love interest in an otherwise great sports movie""-niche.  She essentially caused Barbara Hershey in Hoosiers, Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham, and Barbara Hershey in The Natural.

406972,1,6301982746,"Commonly know as the worst of the Rocky movies (a statement I don't disagree with), ROCKY V shows Rocky broke, brain damaged, and right back to where he started, just another bum around the neighborhood.

One thing that is notable about the film is this is the only ROCKY movie that is rated PG-13. All the others are PG. There are two sections involving nudity. The first instant is we get a really gratitious shot of Stallone standing naked in the shower, and unfortunately we see his ass (who needs to see that???). The second instance is a naked picture that Rocky's boy draws of a French lady with extremely large (so large they're a lot more scary than they are sexy) breasts.

On coming back from Russia after his fight with Russian opponent Drago, a boxing promoter (clearly modeled after real life promoter Don King, of Mike Tyson fame) tries to set up a fight between Rocky and his own fighter. Rocky, however, declines, as he is having health issues. He goes to see the doctor with Adrian, and it is disclosed he has brain damage.

Rocky and Adrian go back to their mansion, but due to financial indiscretion of Paulie, who gave power of attorney to Rocky's accountant, they lose everything, and are forced to go back to the streets of Philly with their son (played by Stallone's real life son Sage Stallone). Their son is having a hard time adjusting, and Rocky makes a big deal out of keeping the relationship with his son alive and well.

Along the way, Rocky meets a fighter named Tommy Gunn, played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison. He starts training him, and Tommy gets a few victories. However, Tommy is not happy as he is not getting any money, so the boxing promoter moves in and essentially buys Tommy out. The boxing promoter's sole agenda is to get Rocky back in the ring, and tries using Tommy against Rocky. By this time Rocky's son is mad because he thinks Rocky hasn't paid him any attention. Rocky renews his relationship with his son.

Tommy Gunn shows up at a local bar, wanting to fight Rocky in the ring and Rocky declining. Ultimately, the movie's climax fight is actually a street brawl, and a rather bad street brawl out that.

As far as its relationship to the other films, this is the most disappointing of them all. You watch Rocky in the first four films as he becomes successful and a great boxer. Then ROCKY V has Rocky lose everything he has gained in the first four films, and he's right back to where he started - out on the streets, broke. This plotline totally invalidates the spirit of the first four ROCKY films. Now, it's understandable people lose their property thru bad financial decisions, etc, but it's absolutely heartbreaking to see Rocky thrust back to the very place he had risen above. Almost makes you wonder why the hell you went thru the other four films if Rocky starts out just where he began at.
As far as the power of attorney bit, Rocky in the first four films is pretty street-smart when it comes to money, and wouldn't legally Rocky or Adrian have to sign off on those forms and not just Paulie? Though people may think the accountant was corrupt, he was actually trying not to steal their money but double it in a deal that ultimately fell through, but that's neither here nor there. Still, I find it hard to believe Rocky wouldn't have more control over his finances than that, though people with a lot of wealth due need financial assistance (just look at Willie Nelson who had IRS troubles because his accountants didn't pay his taxes for years at a time).

One thing I will say positive about the film is Rocky's attitude toward the boxing promoter. He warns Tommy Gunn not to take up with the promoter, because the promoter is corrupt and cares only about making money, not about him as a person. Given Rocky's career as a boxer, I think Stallone could have incorporated this plotline into a very good Rocky movie. Unfortunately, this ain't it.

Another rather controversial move on Stallone's part was to do a street-fight at the end. While there's nothing wrong with a street-fight, given the climax of the last four films were all ring fights, still it is very disappointing to see Rocky not in the ring. It deviates too far from the format for a large proportion of the Rocky fanbase.

Ironically enough, while it is the worst entry in the franchise, for my money it has the single best line in the entire series. It's when he is having his flashbacks with Mickey, and Mickey yells ""Get up, you son of a bitch, cause Mickey loves ya!"" Favorite line out of all six films without a doubt. It perfectly defines Mickey's character, and is a very fun quote to pull out from time to time.

One good thing about ROCKY V, though, is it's the real reason why we got ROCKY BALBOA, which is a great way to end the series. Stallone acknowledges V as the worst, and says it didn't end the series on an emotional high note, and he didn't want to leave Rocky like that. Thank God, because ROCKY BALBOA is so much better than V, and a great way to end the series. Strangely enough he dropped the brain damage story in BALBOA. Stallone said the brain damage in ROCKY V, while present, was not as extensive as the doctors' thought. He did not go for a second opinion, and deferred to his wife to quit fighting. However, as the years passed he would be given a clean bill of health.

While it is the worst Rocky movie, it's still entertaining. The other five films are much better, but this one is still a somewhat enjoyable film. Just don't go in expecting much.",1193270400,8,5525,4.515
407071,2,6301982746,"If you never watched any Rocky movies, I suggest you watch them.
Keep in mind, you can very much get away with skipping this one.
You are probably best off watching Rocky 1 thru 4 and then Rocky Balboa in order to maintain any reedeeming qualities that this series may have.

Rocky 5 brings to our attention (with mostly sub-par acting) the corruptness that is involved in boxing. Mostof us were already aware of this. Rocky 5 also tries to tell us of a story of family sticking together through rough times. It's a noble story but again done with sub-par acting.

For die-hard Rocky fans, you may as well own this one just to complete the collection. But unlike the other Rocky movies, don't watch it for any other reason but just for the hell of it because you're bored and looking to kill an hour an a half of time.

Even Sly Stallone admits that he's a little embarrassed by Rocky 5, and is one of the reasons why he wrote Rocky Balboa. And he definitely did a great job at reedeeming this story and character with Rocky Balboa",1185062400,3,1031,4.387434554973822

407073,3,6301982746,"I sat up late last night watching this movie and I have to agree with most that this was the weakest of the Rocky movies in terms of plot and plausibility. The Rocky of the first four movies, who despite his lack of education and slow exterior, is far from stupid and rather shrewd in reading people (except maybe his brother in law Paulie). In this movie, Rocky makes departures from character that brain damage can't explain. It's hard to believe that Rock wouldn't see through a violent upstart like Tommy, trust alcoholic Paulie to be in charge of his finances at all in the first place, or be that distant from his son (though of course he doesn't realize he is at all in his zeal to develop his own version of Mini-Me). And that street fight was just corny.

However, what saved this movie for me was the interaction between Rocky and ""the kid"" because it was played by a real life father and son. Sly and Sage didn't have to act those scenes-those tender shows of affection (mostly on Rocky's part), and Rocky's heartfelt plea to assure his son of his wish to keep the ""home team"" intact, were absolutely genuine, and made the movie worthwhile to me (of course, I love sappy stuff like that).

Certain parts in the film actually are pretty good but they just don't go together very well. While none of the sequels equal the original Rocky (with the exception of Rocky Balboa), all of them seem to have a flow to them that this one kind of lacked. In fact, when I view this film, I rarely look at the whole thing. Most of the time, I forward it to the end with the streetfight which is probably the best part in the whole film! If you notice, the new Rocky barely mentions Rocky V except for the phrase ""Home Team"" when he was talking to his son! That's how lowly regarded this film is.

I can only recommend this film to die-hard Rocky fans or to those that want the whole story. Otherwise, I'd say skip this one and get the new one along with the first four films.",1174953600,4,947,4.141304347826087

407076,3,6301982746,"Rocky 5 has Sylvester Stallone coming back from Russia with a bad concussion after his fight with Drago. His head must be so bad that he doesn't notice that his son is like 12 or 13 now instead of 8 yrs old like he was when he left him in part 4 to go to Russia lol. Rocky has to retire since he suffered some brain damage. They can't afford their big house anymore and have to move back to the streets where Rocky grew up. Meanwhile I'm sure they could've got good money for Paulie's big talking robot maid that Rocky bought Paulie in Rocky 4 lol. After Rocky revisits Mick's old gym, he decides to be a train people there. A young boxer named Tommy Gunn persues Rocky to be his new manager. Rocky is against it at first but decides to eventually.

  Rocky gets so close to him that he doesn't notice that he's ignoring his own son and that he's not happy. Which starts to hurt their relationship. Since Rocky never actually boxes in this one, the movie is a little more forgettable than the others. This movie is more in tune with the original style of the first movie than it's like the flashy and cartoonish ""but entertaining Rocky 4"".

  It's more about Rocky's struggle after boxing and how hard it is for him to not actually be in the ring himself. When managing Tommy, he basically sees himself in the kid but Paulie warns him that he's not anything like him. Especially after Tommy starts to listen to a sleazy promoter instead of Rocky. He believes he's ready for a title and that Rocky is holding him back. The promoter gets in his head so much that he's soon picking a fight with Rocky but don't expect an actual boxing match betwen the two. But  Rocky getting pumped up by picturing Mick telling him to get off his butt makes the fight scene entertaining anyway.

407078,4,6301982746,"While many reviewers trash this film, I take a different tact.  Rocky returns from Russia with apparent brain damage, and his wife Adrian forbids him to fight professionally.  Compounding their problems, they have lost all their money through a blunder by brother Paulie, and they have to move back into the old rough tough neighborhood of hard knocks.

Rocky V is a story of family.  How will the family pull together to survive this setback?  Rocky has a pre-teen son and although he loves him like a precious gem, the Rock is distracted from his son and his relationship with him, when another fighter, Tommy Gun, (Tommy Morrison) asks Balboa to train and manage him.  So Tommy Gun becomes Rocky's surrogate son and Rocky sees himself in Tommy Gun and pours all of his energy and love into developing Tommy Gun while neglecting the emotional needs of his own son.  There is also tension between Adrain and Rocky, as she sees Rocky neglecting his family for one last shot of fame thorugh Tommy Gun.  The scenes with Adrian are realistic and passionite, and I admire her (acting) ability to stand up to her famous husband to set his straight.  She is the moral compass in his life.  Witout Adrian, Rocky would be adrift at see without a rudder.

Abruptly, Tommy Gun is lured away from Rocky's teaching and guidance by a ""Don King-like"" charcter.  Gun wins the championship and does not find his fans pleased with him, as they resent him for abandoning the man who got him to the top - Rocky Balboa.  So, unrealistically, Tommy Gun initiates a street brawl with Balboa outside the neighborhood bar.  It is a fight to the finish.  Rocky settles his differences with Tommy Gun in a protracted physical battle.

Some highlights of the film are when Rocky goes back to Mick's gym and we view a flashback of Mick training Rocky for the Apollo Creed bout and telling Rocky how much he means to him.  It is a touching scene, and Burgess Meridith is excellent in showing his passion and love for Rocky.  Dittos with the scene where Adrian confronts Rocky on the street after Tommy Gun abandones him, and chastises him for losing his family for his devotion to Tommy Gun. Finally, I loved the scene where Rocky goes down to the street corner to reestablish his relationship with his estranged son.  It is touching and realistic, and shows the tender heart of Rocky that we have all come to love.

As the movie closes, we are treated to scenes of all the previous Rocky movies, from the very beginning to the end.  From this visual reviewal, it is apparent that this was to be the last Rocky movie.  And it could have ended here on a satisfactory note, as all the key issues in the film have been resolved.  However, Stallone's career did not take off as expected after he had put Rocky to rest, so in 2006, he released the final (final) Rocky movie, which by the way is a treat to watch too.

I recommend Rocky 5 as a highly entertaining movie that captures the heart of the character of Rocky and his evolving relationships with his beloved Adrian and his son.

407080,5,6301982746,This was a great rocky movie. It brought the true realities of a successful boxer that had previously encountered fame then went through the present harshness of financial troubles. It also deals with a boxer that has a strong desire to fight for a reason to support his family but cannot because of his severe brain damage injuries sustained by Ivan Drago. It also deals with the aspect of family and how they play an integral part of Rocky. Especially the relationship with his wife and son. I personally feel that their support throughout the last fight with Tommy Gunn helped Rocky on an emotional level to bring back his fighting spirit against Tommy Gunn. Tommy gunn's character also shows how the aspects of greed also affect a boxer's lust for greed. The previous Rocky films did not touch base with the inner realities of a boxer and as a result were mainly based on the 'standard train and fight for a purpose' formula. I felt that this was a great rocky and is a sequal that should not be ignored by any means.,1166659200,2,1021,4.554347826086956
407140,3,6301982746,"Despite still being enjoyable, there was a general feeling among critics and the public back in the late 80's that the last couple of ""Rocky"" movies had gotten a little too cartoonish, broad, and simplistic (especially ""Rocky IV"").  So Sylvester Stallone enlisted the aid of original ""Rocky"" director John G. Avildsen to help bring the series back down to earth with 1990's ""Rocky V"".  The results are generally positive, though bringing subtlety back to the ""Rocky"" series was kind of like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  That is, some of the little storylines and themes, though character based and well acted, STILL felt a little simple and broad.  For example, Rocky has to learn that he shouldn't put all his attention and emotions behind the new fighter he is training, to the exclusion of his son, who needs his attention more.  This is a nice lesson, but an obvious one.

But numerous small touches of the non-obvious variety abound.  I liked how Rocky Jr. was falling prey to a bully until his father showed him how to defend himself.  Seeing Rocky Jr. knocking the bully down was admittedly satisfying but still predictable and obvious, but a couple of scenes later it was nice to see the bully sitting with Rocky Jr. watching TV in the Balboa living room.  It was a subtle grace note, not pounded home with obvious dialogue, showing how kids are often better than adults at getting past feuds and fights and becoming friends.  There were several little touches like this throughout the film.

In many ways ""Rocky V"" is an awkward, gawky type of film, what with its dragging itself kicking and screaming back to a more subtle form of storytelling after Rocky effectively brought down communism in the previous installment.  It attempts to keep the big, inspirational tone of the last couple of movies while simultaneously trying to bring back the intimacy of the first two films, and the fit isn't always perfect.  So I can understand those who don't particularly like the movie.  But I don't understand those who actively hate it.  While not a complete success, ""Rocky V"" is- to this ""Rocky"" fan, at least- always interesting and entertaining.",1164153600,,2172,4.832432432432433

407143,5,6301982746,"To start off, this is a very underrated film. I'm a huge fan of the Rocky films. It's actually one of the better Rocky movies in my opinion. Just because it doesn't have a boxing match or it's ""weak"" and Rocky is broke doesn't mean it is a horrible movie. It's beautiful. It's bittersweet. It's original. People go broke, they get sick, stuff happens, that's life.

Rocky returns home from Russia only to find he has brain damage inflicted on him in the ring by the Ivan Drago. Rocky then discovers that his fortune is gone thanks to Adrian's brother Paulie, who has been squandered by their incompetent accountant. Rocky is forced to sell everything and the family is left broke.

Despite all this, Rocky reluctantly goes back to Philadelphia to start over since medical condition prevents him from boxing. The changes prove to be difficult to Robert(Rocky's son) who quickly becomes involved with a bad crowd, and encounters a bully. Financially desperate, Rocky is tempted to re-enter the ring when shady promoter George Washington Duke offers him a huge amount of money to defend his title. Duke is a very irritating and pushy character. Adrian proves to have the brains in this film as well as in the Balboa clan. She insists that Rocky not risk his life by returning to the ring. Rocky's financial future looks bleak, until he Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, who idolizes Rocky and begs Rocky to train him. Rocky reopens Mickey's gym and begins to train Tommy. The two become good friends, like brothers almost, which puts a strain on Rocky's relationship with his son. He relives his memories through Tommy and becomes alive again while losing himself and his family in the process.

After Tommy the ""Machine Gun"" wins his first few matches, he starts becoming arrogant. George Washington Duke notices Tommy and Tommy leaves Rocky for Duke. In the end Rocky cannot compete with the money, women, and high-priced prizes being offered to Tommy by Duke. The events lead to a nasty confrontation between the two. The street fight in the end is classic. It's very entertaining.

The poignant scenes with Mickey makes Rocky an even more original and loveable character. They distinguish his character. Those moments in the film brought tears to my eyes.

This story is beautiful and Rocky is still a loveable and memorable character.

The movie has some humor to it too. Uncle Paulie is still a funny guy. One part that made me giggle was when Rocky told Adrian ""I can't wait to get you upstairs and violate you like a parking meter"".

I mean, how can you not laugh? It's funny.

This story also shows the true meaning of family. What really touched me is the love that Rocky still has for Adrian.

There are some flaws in the movie though. Rocky, Adrian, and Robert have all noticeably aged and Rocky has gone back to his mumbling ways. You got to turn up the volume a bit more to understand what Rocky is saying. Oh well. It's still good.

407145,5,6301982746,"After seeing this movie, I was somewhat surprised that it is commonly referred to as the worst chapter in the ""Rocky"" saga. In many ways, it is actually the most profound and memorable one. I know director John Avildsen (director of the original ""Rocky"") was reluctant to retake his position as director, but he really outdid himself in this final chapter. The movie starts with a brief recap of Rocky's fight in the Soviet Union. (The end of ""Rocky IV."") As many times before, Rocky enjoys the roaring crowds. However, he learns that this time it came with a horrible price. (Serious brain damage) When Rocky and his crew return home, they encounter the shifty George Washington Duke. (Kind of a fast talking businessman in the field.) He wants Rocky to accept a challenge from a younger boxer named Union Cane. But Rocky's injuries will not allow him to do so. A previous reviewer put it quite well when he said that: ""Throughout the series, we have all heard that Rocky needs to stop fighting before. But somehow, (probably through John Avildsen's directing), we get the impression that this time, it's the real thing."" I grant that it is outside plausibility how all of a sudden Rocky and his family have lost their fortune. (One annoying flaw) Well moving on, Director John Avildsen created a beautiful scene when Rocky reopens the gym and has the flashback with Mickey. (This will eventually distinguish Rocky's character.) Soon afterwards, Rocky and Tommy Gun meet. Their relationship starts nice enough, though Tommy does reveal a character flaw. (Learning to fight by punching his drunk father.) Rocky decides to train Tommy to fight in his place. Rocky now finds himself in Mickey's position. (Good.) It isn't long before Rocky pushes Tommy Gun almost to the top. This is when things start to go bad. Duke realizes that if he can't get Rocky to fight, he can probably get Rocky's new student to fight. After a not so long 'eventually,' Tommy forgets about loyalty and starts to think more of the fame and rewards. It is tempting for us to despise Tommy for this. However, we are probably hypocrites if we do. At one or more points in our lives, we were most certainly guilty of this. Despite defeating the current champion, Tommy Gun realizes that many people dislike him for abandoning Rocky. So now, Tommy decides that taking down his mentor and friend is the way to get the reputation and fame that he wants so much. (Once we start gaining, we never have enough. Another sad human flaw.) Again, we may be repulsed by this shameful act, but we probably all have 'bitten the hand that fed us' for our own selfish purposes. This leads to a bitter confrontation between Tommy Gun and the mentor that was so kind to him. In all honesty, this was really an ideal concluding chapter. Rather than just seeing Rocky in the ring AGAIN, we see him reflect moral values despite his brain damage. (Nice paradox) We also get to see him train someone; And where the final confrontation is concerned, rather than Rocky fighting an opponent we just want him to beat, there is the tragic old mentor vs the young student who showed promise. How different is this from the Obi Wan Kenobi vs Anakin scenario? (One might actually wonder if the people who made ""Star Wars III"" took a look at this movie.) And if we are a little sad that this fight had to take place, we should be. It's a sad reality that the protege or side kick often starts loyal and dedicated, but eventually he wants more for himself, and will eventually care more about his own advancement and be willing to betray his trainer if need be.

407147,4,6301982746,"5 years after the dreadful but watchable Rocky IV, Stallone returned to the big screen but not the ring for another Rocky sequel.

In Rocky V, Rocky returns from the brutal fight with Ivan Drago to discover that he's being diagnosed with brain damage. With the now annoying nagging of Adrian, Rocky decides to retire once and for all. To make matters worse for the poor old slugger, he goes bankrupt after his accountant runs off with his fortunes.

Rocky returns to the streets of Philly where he takes over Mickey's old gym. There he meets a young Oklahoma fighter named Tommy Gunn. Rocky sees a conviction in the kid and decides to take him into his home and train him to become the next champ.

Cut to the chase, a loud mouthed boxing promoter named Duke, played by Richard Gant, who is a carbon copy of Don king but without the hairdo, lures young Tommy with cash and fortune and a chance at the title, something he failed to do with the stubborn and honest Rocky. Duke has plans however, and that is to bring Rocky back into the ring and the way to do that is to turn his protege against him for a fight of a lifetime (Old lion against Young lion).

The movie focuses on the corruption of the boxing commission, and Rocky's family problems: Rocky's preoccupation with Tommy leaves his son Rocky Jr, played by Stallone's real life son Sage, having to learn how to cope with street life alone, causing a near family breakup.

The movie succeeds in bringing back the grit and realism of the original Rocky thanks to the return of John G. Avildsen to the director's seat, something that Stallone disregarded in Rocky IV.

407148,4,6301982746,"This film is bashed mercilously, all while the sell out that is number IV is celebrated?

Actually, while I still consider this movie superior to the forth, it is admittedly inferior to the first three. It should actually be rated ""3 1/2 stars.""

What makes this movie better than number 4?

The storyline is better thought out. It again focuses on psychological themes. Balboa is brain damaged and ripped off by his accountant.  Rocky and his family now have to start over in the same neighborhood he originally escaped. Being well into his 40s (or near 50?), the boxer is too old and too injured to fight. He can train fighters, however, and he reopens Mickey's gym and makes a go of it.

An ambitious brawler named ""Tommy Gunn"" wants a manager, and Rocky sees a potential for success once again.

Unfortunately, Rocky starts to neglect his family. His poor son is being bullied, and needs to ""toughen up"" on his own. His Dad is completely preoccupied with Tommy.

Tommy is actually a ""Judas,"" and sells out to a corrupt promoter that's a crude characterature of Don King.

Rocky's Judas needs to ""escape Rocky's shadow,"" and is convinced by the promoter to defeat his old mentor in the ring. Instead of falling into the trap, Rocky is provocated into brawling with Tommy in the street.

Again, Balboa finds his self respect ... and lives happily ever after with his family.

Why is this movie WEAKER than the first three?

The tacky ""rap music,"" complete with the overused chant ""go for it!""

The manic, shaking, abrupt editing style of the fighting.... designed to make it ""more dramatic."" It just becomes annoying.

The same weakness Rocky 4 had... this aging fighter would have little chance against the young and powerful brute. But they make up for this discrepancy in part by having the old man utilize ""street fighting"" moves. And instead of the brain damaged man getting slugged in the head repeatedly, it would had been more logical to have Rocky move, dodge and defend better... ala ""Rocky 3.""

This movie recaptures some of the heart that made Rocky a franchise, but it admittedly fails to live up to the first three.

407149,1,6301982746,"Okay, where to start... In my Rocky collection (I didn't bother to buy the 5-disc set) I have 1 (of course) 4 and...that's it. Anyone who says that the first Rocky was inferior to any of its sequels is cracked. You can't touch it. In part 1, Stallone WAS Rocky. In the sequels, Rocky was just a character he played, each one being worse as they progressed. Rocky in the original movie was a very charming character in his own ""dumb"" way, even when he was breaking guys' thumbs. You were able to sympathize with him and his struggles. A truly genuine performance by Stallone. In part 2, Stallone tries to re-capture this character but comes up short. He does more ""acting"" than ""being"". The movie also moves way to quickly as it is jam-packed with too much story. Part 3. C'mon Stallone. Mickey should've died in part 2 and be out of his misery by this point. I bought 4, not because of its ""superior"" acting, (scoff) or its believeability, (ha!) but because of the Rocky sequels I think it's the only one that holds my attention... Only if I skip through the boring parts. Okay, part 5. First, did'ja ever notice as the Rocky's progressed, Rocky got a little less ""dumb""? He must have been cured buy money, because now that he has returned to being broke, all of a sudden he's dumb again. Maybe it's the brain damage, maybe it's an attempt to re-capture his character. Either way it doesn't work. Of the few things I did like was Rocky's conversation with Mickey, which I found particularly touching. This should have been his only appearance. The one at the end was embarassing. Tommy Gunn. Annoying. 'Nuff said. ""The Duke"", just as bad. Rocky's son, (in real life as well) should be given an Oscar for the movie's only believeable character, and then be shot for being a little ****. No wait, Talia Shire does a good job, but should have shot herself for even thinking of being in this movie. I guess it was either that or McDonalds. Would you like fries with that?

407222,2,6301982746,"First off I am a huge fan of the Rocky series but cannot find any reason to like this movie despite several attempts at watching it.  The basic story is that while Rocky is away, bringing down communism, his corrupt accountant has squandered all of Rocky's fortune.  He was able to do this because Paully convinced Rocky to sign a power of attorney.

Rocky is unable to continue fighting because he has developed brain trauma.  He is also unable to do commercials because people have been looking into his past affiliation with low level mob figures.

Rocky returns to the Mickey's Gym which is now owned in his son's name.  There a young hopeful boxer, Tommy Gunn, gets Rocky to be his manager.  Rocky starts devoting his energies to train Tommy and also continue fighting vicariously through him.  During all this Rocky has been neglecting his own son and is being taunted by a shameless promoter known as the Duke (striking resemblance to Don King).

It all plays out in the end with Rocky fighting his new protege and regaining the love and trust of his son.

This wouldn't have been too bad of a storyline but it has way too many holes.  How long was Rocky in Russia for?  His son ages around 10 years while he is gone.  I would feel a little distant from my dad too.  Rocky was always a bit punchy but when would he have ever listened to Paully for financial advice.  He most certainly would have deferred to Adrian on this.  Secondly the accountant would have needed Adrian's signature on everything.  Adrian would have certainly started a college fund and trust for her son that no power of attorney would have been able to touch.  Americans love Rocky and would have rallied around him no matter his past.  Even Mike Tyson still draws interest and Rocky is a saint compared to him.
How can Rocky lose his house to back taxes?  He would have easily been able to raise the funds from selling the gym and Paully's house.  Why is every good fighter white and every bad fighter black?  Certainly there would have been considerable residuals from previous marketing campaigns Rocky did, remember all the merchandise and commercials from Rocky III?

This movie just does not work for me.  It was reported that Rocky II was written in 30 hours.  I think this was written in 30 minutes.  I had the entire Rocky set given to me as a gift.  I sold this copy at the used movie store, still sealed, for $2 and felt I was more than fairly treated.",1124928000,37,2442,4.5159817351598175
407223,4,6301982746,"I just bought the ""Rocky-box-edition"" (including all the five movies) and to be honest I didn't expect much. I bought it first of all because of the masterpiece of the first movie, a moving and oscar-worthy performance of the entire cast. The chemistry is to be touched between the actors, and ""Rocky"" has to be one of the best movies of the 70's. It's not mindless action, it's far more drama than it is action -and it has a fantastic story to tell. It contains more documentary than it dwells on sentimentality, and still the character-development is so overwhelming. Rocky Balboa, the boxer with a heart of gold -and he's a character you'd have a heart of stone not to like. I'm lost for words here, but let's put it this way; This movie (including its' five followers, perhaps with Rocky 4 as an exception..?) is unlike anything else Sylvester Stallone has ever done. And I think it's sad the way Stallone has wasted his talent on shallow-action-movies in the later years of his carrier. ""Rocky"" is the main proof of that Stallone is far more than muscles, this is a movie to take serious, and yes, it's deep.

Back to this final Rocky (so far). It was something moral and far overdone about Rock 4, however entertaining it somehow crossed the line where the previous movies had managed to be ""the real thing"". As in realistic to some level. And they perfectly matched eachother. Rocky 4 was Van Damme-material, which could have been ok if it hadn't been for that it didn't fit in anywhere in the Rocky-collection. Now that it's made I'm glad it's added to the box, but it's the weakest of the five. It doesn't contain the same inspirating storytelling, and unlike the others (including the fifth) it's in the typicall ""sequel""-category. However entertaining it may be as mentioned. It contains good music as a plus.

Well, let's try again; With the same director of Rocky (the first) behind the wheels the spirit is back. Rocky is back! You might as well've skipped the fourth. It again gives a perspective of the chynical sports-business, and the subject is betrayal. And also the bound of family, and the things that really matters in life. All amazingly done, and the saga is somehow completed -without a final match in the ring which could have been too silly. The balance between reality and entertainment is back, and the movie is a joy to watch.

Incredible for a number five!

(Correction; Rocky 3 is the weakest of the five, I hadn't seen it before I wrote this review a couple of days ago, and now that it's done - I must say I didn't think it could be worse than Rocky 4, but I am sorry to say it is. Skip 3 and 4 and you have an impressive triology, I'm still glad I bought the box set.)",1120262400,,2704,4.534836065573771

This is a little depressing though and goes kind of far when Rocky has to sell almost everything he has.  George Washington Duke try's to be the Don King of boxing in this film and is a little annoying.  Once you decide  that's just the way the director wanted to go then you will see that this movie is and should be accepted to the Rocky saga.  Tommy Morrison, the guy who plays Tommy Gunn, really boxed for a little while in his real life and was pretty good.  I think they made the best decision by not having the fight between Rocky and Tommy in a ring and having it on the streets.  Rocky put on a show for his old neighborhood and wasn't trying to inpress anybody,  he was just fighting for his pride there.  It sure is a little creepy when he has those flashbacks of Apollo Creed dying and Mickey screaming and talking to him but it was a nice touch.  You must get this movie to complete the Rocky saga.

""Well, come get it.""

- Tommy Gunn tries to get out from under Rocky's shadow, but, Rocky has a Christmas gift in the form of an ass whoopin' in ""Rocky V""

Formulaic third sequel that seems like a walk down memory lane than actually trying to tell a story.

After the events in ""Rocky IV"", the Rock, with Adrian, Paulie and Duke return home to find out that while they were in Russia, the family's attorney has skipped town with all of Rocky's money (Paulie had mistakenly signed power of attorney over to him before leaving).

Now broke and all of their belongings being auctioned off to pay for tax evasion, the good times come to a close, as Rocky finds out the only thing he owns, finacially, is the gym that Mickey gave to Rocky Jr. in his will. Rocky & the Balboa family move back into the old Phillie neighborhood that they fought their out of all those years ago.

Things get grim when Rocky finds out he has irreversible brain damage, meaning that one more fight could kill him.

Whats even worse is a scruplous fight promoter, George Washington Duke, hounding Rocky trying to get him back into the ring, for a mighty payday no matter what the cost to Rocky's life.

A small glimmer of hope for Rocky turns up in the form of Tommy Gunn, a promising young fighter who is a big fan of ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky decides to take the young fighter under his wing and train him much the same way Mickey trained him. But, as Tommy gets better & heads up to the top of the rankings, fans & the media nickname Tommy, ""Rocky's Shadow"", a nickname that Tommy doesn't take kindly to.

Whats worse is that George Washington Duke is slowly moving in and steering Tommy into his direction, enticing the kid with money, cars, women, etc. Things that Rocky couldn't give the kid. Tommy signs a contract, practically ditching Rocky.

But, the one thing Tommy doesn't have, & wants more than anything else, is respect and Tommy has none of it. Its up to Rocky to teach the kid a lesson & know his role.

""Rocky V"" is easily the weakest link in the saga. It trys to capture the spirit of the earlier films, but, somehow doesn't quite grasp it. The problem here is in the first 2 films viewers watched Rocky as a hungry fighter going the distance, twice, and beating the odds, while, in this film it just seems like a been there, done that attitude blankets the film.

It does suck to see Rocky lose it all & move back into a place that he thought he would never have to go back to.

The fight at the end is o.k., at best (again, I would rate it dead last in the saga, as far as the fights go). When I first realized this was the big fight of the movie, it really was a dissapointment (no training montage?! no ""eye of the tiger""!?!)

""Rocky V"" is a decent enough movie, but, I always thought the saga should've gone out with a bang, than a whimper.

As for ""Rocky VI"", its highly likely that it will ever hit the big screen (""V"" was released 15 years ago). There is a script treatment that is worth checking out in Stallone's own magazine titled ""Sly"".

In the script an aging Rocky realizes that nothing lasts forever. Its been roughly five years since the death of Adrian, Paulie finally gets a girlfriend and moves in with her, Rocky Jr. has grown up & become a busy businessman & for the first time in a long while Rocky is all alone. But, when the current heavyweight champ is dissed on a ESPN style cableshow, in which a daily feature has a current sportstar going up against a sportslegend of the same sport (its all CGI & computer enhanced), in this case, he went up against Rocky & lost badly, he calls Rocky out of retirement to see if he still has The Eye Of The Tiger.

It has a good street fight at the end between rocky and tommy and is a good way to end the series.

There is very little boxing in this movie and it just might be Sly's worst performance ever. This series seemed to follow a regressive pattern.

407229,2,6301982746,"I have to give it up for Rocky V.  It's one of the best bad movies ever made.

The original Rocky was a likeable enough film, inspired by a real nobody who went the distance with Ali and lived to tell about it.

After the success of Rocky, Stallone got real moviemaking power and went to work building one of the more lucrative and shameless franchises in Hollywood history.  Every button was pushed, every last drop was milked from the formula, and then some.

While Rocky would have died after Rocky II (if not after the original beating), he somehow lived to survive the train wreck beating of Rocky IV, where 'the Russian' (played by a Swede) pounds Rocky into hamburger and still loses.

Rocky V picks up right after Rocky IV.  The Rock has brain damage (finally), and before you know it, he's broke and moves back to his old South Philly neighborhood with wife Adrian, his young son, and professional waste of life Paulie, who gave Rocky's millions to a shady accountant.

The result is a work of genius.  Not only is it bad, but it's entirely watchable.  Stallone has that unique ability to disregard his own absurdity and take it to the next level.  It's something that Steven Seagal, for example, tried to do, with some success.  Rocky was his creation, so it's entirely understandable that he would do his best to destroy that creation, and then some, all the while believing he was making a quality film.  While he once claimed that Rocky IV was the final Rocky film, he is now obsessed with making Rocky VI.

As well he should.  Rocky V has our meathead hero training a new kid, played by Tommy the Duke Morrison.  Eventually, the Duke, or the Gunn, whatever his name is, is tempted by a shady promoter who is obviously Don King, and Rocky then has to play the role of Micky and Apollo, his previous mentors.  Oddly enough, the director is John G. Avildsen, who made the original Rocky film before Stallone's ego hijacked the franchise for years.

There are plenty of cliches, plenty of brain-damanged wisdom, plenty of shameless flashbacks (so we can work in Micky and Duke, though Apollo had more shame than to appear, it seems) and of course, another end-bout, this one in the street as Rocky takes another beating but still manages to win, his brain now reduced to a brittled peanut, his body somehow still in one piece.

The Rocky sequels have all been ridiculous ego trips for Stallone, but they've all been shamelessly entertaining, if completely, insanely unrealistic.  Rocky, remember, never learned how to block, and his head appears to be made of iron, literally.  Stallone has made a science out of making moronic, violent films.

I can't commend Stallone enough for this one.  I don't see where else the series can go.  Perhaps Rocky can return for one more movie, now bound to a wheelchair, drooling as he imagines what might have happened had he lost to Apollo, Mr T, or Drago, who all have ripe cameo potential.",1110240000,5,2939,4.640232108317215
407230,5,6301982746,"Somewhere in the Rocky series, the character of Rocky Balboa changed from a real character into some sort of a quasi-superhero.  In Rocky IV, although the theme of Rocky being the underdog was still in-tact, it suddenly was Rocky against the Russian (Ivan Drago).  Lost in the shuffle was a story with some depth.  Lost was the outstanding character development - that was particularly strong in the first two Rocky movies.  In fact, more or less - a good chunk of Rocky IV was more of a music video.  When I heard that Rocky V was going to take Rocky back to Philadelphia a broke and down and out fighter, I was disappointed. After watching the movie, I realized that Sylvester Stallone corrected a good number of the problems I saw with Rocky IV and actually created a very good story that would be a perfect way to wrap-up the Rocky series.

Here is the story:  After defeating Ivan Drago in Moscow, Rocky returns home to two problems:  1) He is Broke - he left Power of Attorney to a crooked lawyer, who never paid his taxes and made poor investments;  2)  He has health problems:  The years of all of the beatings have damaged his brain - therefore he cannot fight.  Broke and no longer able to fight, the Balboas go bankrupt and basically move back to Inner City Philadelphia.  Rocky still has the old Gym that was his old manager Mickey's and begins to train fighters.  A crooked fight promoter (Don King-like promoter) named George Washington Duke  is trying to lure him for a big fight and Adrian clearly doesn't want him to do this.  Along the way, comes a young Midwestern fighter named Tommy Gunn (played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison).  Tommy becomes Rocky's protege and Rocky guides him to contention.  While training Tommy, Rocky is ignoring his family - mostly his son (played by Stallone's son Sage Stallone).  Eventually Duke gets to Tommy and convinces him to turn on Rocky.  This leads to a dramatic and exciting street fight confrontation between the two.

While the first four movies focused on the theme of the underdog, Rocky V takes a different tact.  The theme seems to be scams and deceptions.  This is prevalent throughout the movie.  This is seen when Rocky loses his money,  Duke trying to lure Rocky into the ring,  Rocky's son getting picked on at school, and Tommy turning on him.

There is some great character development and performances in the movie.  I do feel that Adrian's character doesn't really grow that much in the movie, but I was impressed by Tommy and Rocky Jr (called Robert) in this movie.  Both Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone deliver great performances.  Tommy grows as a character - from a shy, but cocky kid from Oklahoma to the ""turn"" as a bad guy who becomes the World Champion.  We see how Rocky Jr. starts out as ""the rich kid"", but eventually is able to hold his own in a tough school.  But perhaps the surprise of the movie is good ol' Paulie - Rocky's Brother in Law.  In Rocky IV, Paulie still had his sense of humor, but had been relegated to the role of cantankerous curmudgeon.  Throughout the Rocky movies, Rocky always looked out and helped out Paulie.  In Rocky V, Paulie will still be a cantankerous curmudgeon whom Rocky looks out for - but there is a major change.  Toward the end of the movie, Paulie stands up for Rocky.  This happens when Tommy turns on Rocky.  It's Paulie who turns around and reminds Tommy how much Rocky sacrificed for Tommy and stands up to the young kid - very emotional stuff.  Also Richard Gant's performance as Duke is very believable.

I like how they fold Burgess Meredith back into the movie.  Although Mickey died in Rocky III, he comes back in Rocky V through some dream sequences.

The movie contains plenty of real caemos.  Most noteable are Philadelphia TV Sports personality ""Big Al"" Meltzer and Philadelphia Columnist and Radio Host, Stan Hochman.  Also in the movie are real-life Boxing analysts - Stu Nahan and Al Bernstein.  Real-life referees Lou Filllipo and Frank Cappucino are refs in the movie.

One problem that I felt plagued the Rocky series since Rocky II has been Sylvester Stallone over-choreographing the Boxing sequences.  Clearly by Rocky IV, the Boxing sequences were completely unrealistic.  In Rocky V, while there are still some Boxing sequences with Tommy Gunn that are still over-choreographed, Rocky Balboa is not going to get in the ring in this movie at all.  A predictable thing would have been to end with a Boxing match between Rocky and Tommy - and as I watched this movie, that is where I felt it was heading.  However, what happens instead is a Philadelphia Street fight.  While Stallone over-choreographed the Boxing matches, the Street Fight is great.  I found it incredibly exciting and it proved to be the perfect ending.

Rocky movies have always had great music - from Bill Conti, to Survivor, to Vince DiCola - it was passionate.  I think Rocky V's music is the weakest of the series as it tended to go more toward rap/street music.  But I also think the music is better used in this movie - instead of as a music video like in Rocky IV, it compliments the movie.  This is very evident when you listen to the music during the Street fight.  However, I think the use of Elton John's ""The Measure of a Man"" as the song in the closing credits is perfect.  It provides the perfect theme to end the movie as well as the Rocky series.  You will also see a montage of clips from all the movies.

Overall, while not the award winning caliber of the original, I still enjoy this movie.  It is one of my favorites in the Rocky series.  It deserves a chance, despite the negative reviews.  Highly recommended.",1110067200,8,5651,4.617085427135678
407271,3,6301982746,"I though after the greatest victory of Rocky's life against Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, it should have all ended there with Rocky Balboa on top as the greatest fighter of all time. Also I felt that the last photo of Rocky at the end of Rocky IV with the American flag behind him was the monumental way to end the story as it represented the picture to remember Rocky by. To some extent I can see how there would need to be a Rocky V, but the way this movie came out wasn't the Rocky V I was imagining.

After returning from Russia after his greatest triumph, Rocky returns to American realizes his millions has been stolen by his theif accountant. Rocky now has now been diagnosed with permanent brain damage from all those years of fighting (Ivan Drago a big reason). Rocky, Adrian, Rocky Jr (Sage Stallone) and Paulie are left broke and must return to the old low-rent neighborhood where they started out in Philadelphia. The only thing that Rocky can do now is take  over Mickey's Gym that was left to him in 1982 when Mickey died.

Returning to Philadelphia, Rocky discovers a hungry young fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison). Rocky decides to manage Tommy and turn him into a the number-one contender. Along the way, Rocky now begins to neglect his family more and more causing more resentment by Rocky Jr against his father. After Tommy becomes the top contender, he betrays Rocky and decides to go with a unscrupolous promoter, Mr. George Washington Duke. Now that Tommy has become the new heavyweight champion, the fans and the press hound him for betraying Rocky. Duke convinces Tommy that to get respect, he must fight Rocky.

I have to say, the final fight between Rocky and Tommy was pretty good due to the fact that it was a street fight this time. Rocky proves once again that even with brain damage, he can still finish on top.

This movie had an okay plot, and the fight was good. But I do strongly feel that as a major Rocky fan, the series should have ended after Rocky IV or Rocky V should have been a lot better. In my opinion this was a shamless way to end four great movies. In a way the circle was completed in the process from bum to star to bum all over again.

407274,5,6301982746,"Sage Stallone is natural and great.

Sylvester Stallone began to show that HE WAS THE WILL SMITH OF HIS ERA.  What did he do in Rocky series?  He was just showing an autographic series of his own story in the fighting for a seat of the big screen acting.

Misfortunes in his personal life was well seamed with his then focused and concerted efforts of winning his son to his side, whom was left alone most of the time to seek out own ways to earn a position in his own life.  Who also was in a dire need of knowing that a father as powerful as Sylvester Stallone was not going to leave him alone not paying attention to his growing.

Lightly touched issue, like many of Sylvester Stallone's personal life points, like facing son after dividing and separating in real life, is rewardedly completed by Sylvester Stasllone's complacent smile dotted on the stage where Rocky Balboa statue was erected where Museum of Art stands always at Philadelphia.

Tommy Gunn, might be a symbol of many who have taken a portion of Sylvester Stallone's life, love, and training in his own path to successes, turned his back against Sylvester STallone to swallow him.  A star as geat as Sylvester Stallone let him do it as he did in many occasions of his life.  Earning big $ returns seems to have made Sylvester Stallone unnecessarily humble and ready to receive any humiliations.  What a clown, when one chose to be a male actor?  What a clown's life lay around him?  One would wonder until when would this abuse cease?

It is nice in movie that Sylvester Stallone did not get swallowed by Tommy Gunns, but returned suredly and safely to the protection of his own child and his own wife--thanks to Paulie, that wife was often on the brinks of becoming financially, and perhaps emotionally drained.",1100131200,,1781,4.598101265822785

The last time I saw the dvd on sale,it only had the trailer as a special feature. I would like for Stallone to include the film featurettes,photo galleries,the tv interviews Stallone and his son,Sage Stallone gave for the press,the tv ad campaigns,cast interviews,and everyones'favorite:deleted scenes with and without commentary,including the alleged death of Rocky scene that was reportedly shot and later shelved.

The first four films were ensconsed within the first fourness of a trilogy, whereas this baby is free as a bird.  When we appreciate that Rocky and Raging Bull set out the ropes for the boxing movie, how then are we to believe - tolerate - this fight procedure without a heavy yawn, a bored reach for the remote, an effort at opening our eyes when all we gawp at are stereotypes of hero/villain idolatory that our generation thought were done with. rocky!",1092960000,3,614,4.482142857142857
407278,5,6301982746,"While I'm not sure this was the closing Rocky film, I believe it should be. And that said, I must point out that this is not intended to be like the other Rocky films.  This was a movie about real life; a movie about our relationships with the people who have surrounded us all of our lives - and this film does a great job of making us think about such things.
After Rocky returns from Russia, and his kid has aged like five years in a month, he learns that his attorney has stolen all of his money...drats, it's back to the hood for the now brain-damaged boxer (imagine that).  Rocky's only possession is Mick's old gym, and it is outside that gym that Rocky meets Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison - I think is his real name).  Rocky trains him and gets him some big name fights, but has trouble moving fast enough for the immature Tommy Gunn, who decides to hook up with a Don King-like promoter.
I'm not telling you anymore...you have to buy the film!
Sorry.

I thought it was great though, he actually remains retired but ends up in a street fight with the kid he makes into a contender.

407362,5,6301982746,"When I first saw this film at the age of 6, I really didn't know what to make of it, even though I am a die-hard Stallone/Rocky fan. But being a huge fan, there really is no way I can give this a bad review.
I will admit the film does seem out of place a little bit. In the previous movies, Rocky speaks with great grammar most of the time, now he is back to his bumbling terrible grammar ways again. But of course that could have been the result of taking one too many hits to the head in the previous movie.
I can see where other Rocky fans would dislike this movie because Rocky doesn't go back into the ring and it doesn't have the vintage Rocky story to it. Plus the soundtrack just seemed out place the majority of the time.
But let's face it, when one is watching this film, you can easily tell that it is a movie about the hardships of boxing. The other four movies were mainly perspective on one's hardships in life from a bum to champion of the world. None of them seem to have captured the true hardships of boxing itself as a career. I won't go into much detail about that, but you get the picture.
The street fight is entertaining and the movie itself serves its purpose.",1080518400,2,1184,4.1521739130434785

407364,3,6301982746,"Rocky V, the fifth series of Rocky series, in 1990, ended up proving that you can't get back the gist of what the earlier Rocky series had.
The street of Philadelphia where Rocky was born and bred still is there. However, the time has changed that much even the same place looks different. Rocky Balboa donning his favorite hat when he was the unknown fighter in Philadelphia looks a bit out of place. The storyline is shaky as Rocky Balboa the retired former champion might have been like. He meets a young man and teaches everything he had to the Tommy Gunn. After Tommy betrays Rocky, there will be an unexpected street-fighting scene that caused uproar from Rocky fans. I can have no clues to what the coming Rocky movie will be like. I give this movie three stars because of nostalgia you can find from this movie particularly ol' Micky. (He surely got old).",1079222400,,863,4.574193548387097
407365,1,6301982746,"Forget the other ""Rocky"" films that came before this one. This movie is simply horrible. I am a huge ""Rocky"" fan, but this sequel attempts to reach and it reaches too far. It's obvious that the script intended for Rocky to end-up a street-fighter, which is in no way in character with Rocky in any of the previous films. Not to compare it with the other films, but you have to know where Rocky is coming from, and it's not from the street-fighting realm. He's a trained, yet sloppy, loser-fighter in the clubs of Philadelphia of the mid-1970's. If he ever fought in the streets, there's never any indication that he did so before. That's how this film reaches by rewriting the Rocky character, which is just not acceptable after four films have already been made about his life. Rocky is a fascinating Everyman, but a dirty, low-class, blood-thirsty street-fighter he is not. The film tries to make him seem glorious for returning to his roots after overcoming them, which is what makes the Rocky saga so amazing in the first place. Rocky V is based on a totally different character which is not Rocky Balboa, but a cheap imposter. Save your money and just be concerned with Rocky's I thru IV. And, be leary of Stallone's future sixth installment of the ""Rocky"" series...it can't possibly recover from this disaster! (Although, I'd like to be proven wrong.)",1076457600,3,1357,4.729957805907173
407366,5,6301982746,People who don't like this don't get it.....They are either into all action no story and this is a perfect movie. It shows the true world of boxing for once how young fighters get all the chance all the glory and then when all life is sucked out are thrown to the gutter to die. As said people who hate it don't understand that TO WIN HE HAD TO GO BACK TO WHERE HE STARTED go back to the streets where he had no need of the title the money the fame because all the people loved him and knew he was the THE TRUE CHAMP. Now ROCKY IV that would have been a bad endding so over the top i love the film but come on Russia cheering for Rocky lol what a joke great movie but so glade 5 was made to tie it all up and go out the way ROCKY should have.,1070236800,2,742,3.7628205128205128
407367,4,6301982746,"I remember seeing Rocky V as an 8 year old kid, and was disapointed with it.  Until a few months ago when I viewed it again, I felt this way until wathcing it late at night, and concentrated on Rocky V as a totally seperate movie from the previous four.  When doing it this way, Rocky V is not a half bad film.  It certainly doesn't have that feel good spirit the other four had.  There isn't much to be happy about, and we don't get to see Rockky have a motivational training sequence.  There also is no Apollo Creed which instnatly kills off the pace of this film.  However, Rocky V I feel ranks right up with the first one when it comes to acting.
  It isn't so much Stallone who improves, but somehow, he convinces you his brain is damaged.  But it's the new comers to this movie which actually make it such a well acted movie.  Richard Gant plays the scum bag Don King impersonator George Washington Duke and he does the role well.  Give him Don King's hair, and you have a Don King.  Ex Pro Boxer Tommy Morrison acts pretty darn well for his one and only movie.  He carried himself like a seasoned veteran in this film, but the one who really steals the show is Stallone's son Sage.  The fact that Rocky's son ages from 5-14 in about 2 years worth of time between Rocky 3 and 5, Sage Stallone like Morrison carried himself like he had done many movies.  You really see the transition from a snobby yet kindhearted richkid, to intimidated to his new environment, to being a punk in the poorhouse, to a kid learning to adjust in the end.  He plays it perfectly.  Why Sage's career didn't take off I don't know.  His only other role was a supporting role in another Stallone movie ""Daylight"".  I hear it's his choice, but I'm not sure.
  In the end, is this the worst of the 5 Rocky's?  I feel the 2nd was.  Rocky 4 and 3 had a lot more action than this one, but if you are looking to actually watch a movie where good acting dominated it, and not the action, watch Rocky 1, and 5.
  As a little side note, if nothing else, watch this movie for the credits. Elton John performs what I feel to be his best song.  ""The Measure of a Man""  That song is just incredible, and almost brings a tear to my eye when I see it with the little Rocky montage they have for the credits.  All in all a very good movie",1025568000,,2304,4.163265306122449

Money, fame, being somebody of high class, and in this one, they turn him back down to the virtual bum he was in the first one! And yet in this one, he isn't even the fighter, how stupid! I'm surprised they didn't just call it 'Tommy'. Afterall, Tommy Gunn is the star here. And what was really dumb was that not even in the end did they show him getting back on his feet financially. They just leave everybody clueless as to what happened to his finances. Did he get his financial problem worked out? Is he still the victim of Pauly's stupid mistake? Rocky's goal AND Adrian's goal was for him to get a nice place, money, ect. Other than being champion, that was the whole other goal.
And in that street fight at the end, it wasn't even announced if he'd get any money for that fight with Tommy. This movie just leaves you high and dry and to what happenes to him financially and just seeing him lose everything like that was depressing!

Tommy Gunn really comes out of nowhere and Rocky takes him under his wing without really knowing him. It's hard to buy any of it really and the dialogue overall is pretty poor.
