671143,4,6303515894,I've always been a fan of Paul Walker and this is certainly my new best PW movie!  It helps if you like thrillers too because the plot keeps you engaged the whole way and their are lots of unexpected twits and turns and the action is first class as well. It's nice to see South Africa as a location and this movie has a great look to it. This is a  strong recommend for anybody who likes Paul Walker and thrillers.,1366848000,,414,4.098765432098766
671144,3,6303515894,"Paul Walker plays an American traveler Michael, who has just arrived at Johannesburg, South Africa, to meet his ex-wife Angelica for the first time in five years. At the airport he rents a car, but Michael notices something is wrong with the vehicle he is driving. Someone has left a cellphone in the glove box, with a strange message sent to it. Michael, whose only wish is to meet Angelica, is in for some more unwanted surprises including a gun.

Just as in ""Rear Window,"" in which Hitchcock's camera (almost entirely) stays in a James Stewart's apartment, in writer / director Mukunda Michael Dewil's sophomore work ""Vehicle 19"" the camera stays in Paul Walker's car for almost every single shot. This is certainly an interesting gimmick, but the novelty soon wears off. The method starts to look forced as the film unfolds, especially during the car chase sequence.

The film works most effectively when showing the streets of Johannesburg seen from someone lost in a foreign city. Perhaps the derivative thriller could have used its locations more effectively with more twists on the storyline. As it is, ""Vehicle 19"" remains a so-so action, entertaining but forgettable.",1366416000,4,1177,5.0
671145,2,6303515894,"Michael Woods (Paul Walker) is an America on parole in South Africa wanting to visit his wife or ex-wife at the embassy. He picks up vehicle 19 at the rental place and it is clearly not for him. This leads him into a battle with crooked police as the vehicle contains things to implicate them in illegal activity.

This film takes place in the car, and not just just bits and pieces of it, I mean all of it. Paul Walker in the car talking on the cell phone. Paul Walker in the car driving on the wrong side of the street. Paul Walker in the car talking to people outside. Paul Walker in the car being chased by the police. Paul Walker being pulled over. Paul Walker in the car being shot at. Paul Walker in the car going through a car wash. Paul Walker in the car while it is getting painted...seriously. Paul Walker is on the screen so much George Clooney wants to change agents. The plot grew boring with no twists.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1365897600,,960,4.269230769230769
671146,4,6303515894,"I've known of the Little Rascals AKA Our Gang comedies/Spanky and Our Gang for as long as I can remember, but as far as I know, I had never seen any until a friend lent me several tapes a few months ago. I found them charming and entertaining. That said, there is a great fluctuation in quality from show to show. VCR #19 contains one of the very best, ""Our Gang Follies of 1936,"" the old ""let's put on a show"" shtick. The series included several of these, and this is the best I've seen. A few ringers, professional kid entertainers, are always included, but it's the work of the regulars, particularly crooner Alfalfa and impresario Spanky, that makes them fun. This tape also includes ""Shrimps for a Day,"" one of many plots in which the gang battles, and inevitably triumphs over, a mean adult. If you're a hard core fan, one of the DVD packages is probably your best bet. If you'd like to just check out a few selections, these 4-episode video tapes are a great low-cost way to find out what all the fuss is about.",1306281600,,1018,4.391534391534392

671474,1,6303515894,"I just saw this movie lately and just couldn't understand for the life of me why Paul Walker would be in something this ghastly.  This movie has no hook or appeal of any kind.  It's an interesting irony how Paul Walker can be in this, there's a promise of action, there's car chases promised, you might expect it to be something light a Fast & Furious movie; well guess again.  Don't me wrong loved Paul Walker and all and this review is not intended to slam Paul in any way.

All that happens is a parole breaker named Michael Woods(Paul Walker) is in Johannesburg for some reason.  He goes to a car rental place and gets the wrong car.  He soon finds a gun and a beautiful captive named Rachel Shabangu.  Michael(Walker) is receiving calls on his cell from some mysterious cop while he's trying to save his wife's life.

The plot here is not at all clear as to wtf is going on.  The pace to this movie is too unacceptably slow. The script is reprehensible and totally beneath Paul all together.  There's some very annoying camera shakes.  A couple of times the camera doesn't even show exactly what happened in some scenes.  There's no one else famous in this film other than the late great Paul Walker.  There are no interesting characters.  It's not clear as to what Paul Walker is even doing in Johannesburg in the first place.  What trouble his wife is in is not clear in the slightest.  You never exactly see her face either.  Their aren't even remotely enough action scenes to make this movie worth anything.  The budget is so embarrassingly low that the action scenes look so unbelievably fake.  There a only 2 action scenes in this movie.  There are no cool stunts or cool explosions.  Rachel is not used in this movie enough to make that character poignant enough.

All in all, this movie really sucks!  It's slow, boring, has very few characters in it and what characters it does have are one-dimensional bores, the script is awful, the plot is incomprehensible, the action is minimal, there's no humor, there's no nudity, the budget is too small, the ending doesn't make much sense and isn't conclusive enough, the motivations of the characters is never clear once, the shaky camera and overt pans are intolerable,  above all this movie so damn flat that the title isn't even explained.  What's the significance of the vehicle being number 19.  This movie is a total trainwreck and I don't understand what would make the late Paul Walker want to be in it in the first place.  I don't often find fault in something that Paul Walker is in but this turkey was just completely unnecessary.
R.I.P.  Paul Walker 9-12-73 to 11-30-13.  Fast and Furious Paul will be missed but he'll never be forgotten.",1465776000,,2707,4.604602510460251

671478,4,6303515894,"I have to say that I have mixed opinion about the overall picture and the quality of the movie and story.  For some of the movie it was slow and it seemed to be only a driving movie (and there was a considerable amount of that) and that is not bad, but it has to be supported by a good plot and acting.

It had some ups and downs during the movie and points where the main character was in trouble.  This can make the story exciting and keep your interest.

In the end, the story had a conclusion that was appropriate and made it worth while to have been watching it.",1463616000,,567,4.035714285714286

671670,4,6303515894,"Paul Walker appeared in some 32 movies and several TV shows before his untimely death.  Of those, Im proud to say this is the first one Ive ever watched [I think hes most well known for several of the Fast & Furious films, which I avoided like bubonic plague].

This film is set in Johannesburg South Africa and Walker plays the part of the American citizen Michael Woods, recently released from prison after serving time for some kind of hit & run accident, trying to visit his ex-wife at the American embassy and rekindle the flame.  He is assigned the wrong vehicle at the Hertz rental agency at the airport [notice the inconspicuous brand placement] and by virtue of that he becomes sucked into a life & death struggle between the police and the chief prosecutor over an international sex-trafficking operation.

Yes, theres plenty of car-chase scenes, although most of them are filmed from inside his car, making it impossible to really see how close the vehicle comes to obstacles, how fast it is moving and so on.  Mostly you see a blur of action through the side windows and some hectic scenes out the front.  Whatever this mini-van is I want it for my next vehicle, because it appears stronger than a Mercedesno, stronger than a Sherman tank.  But enough of cheap shots at the story.  Perhaps this is the only move in which he had the lead role-I'm not sure.  The plot gives the action emotional meaning, and whatever trashy movies he appeared in in the past, I think he had real talent.  There are plenty of close-up scenes on his face in which he cannot fake his way out of acting just through action.  And he acted well.  The first half was fast-paced and engaging.  About half-way through, the pace of directing seemed to slow down for reasons a bit unclear, but that was not his fault as the actor.  Overall I really enjoyed this movie.  It was engaging, but easy to follow.  There is no nudity and very little of even swearwords.  Also there's almost no visible blood, though some violence is depicted.  This is somewhat family friendly for an R-rated movie and Im surprised that it didn't rate PG-13, though some directors seem deliberately to aim for an R rating just as a promotion too.  This film is worth watching.
Well-done, Paul.",1435622400,3,2251,4.624685138539043

It is a thin story and mostly predictable, but moves along pretty well for a film where the guy never leaves the vehicle. Everything is pieced together from phone conversations, radio reports. No flashback scenes to fill in the background. It's all in the now and you have to figure out the where, when and why by inference and interpolation. It is filled with slightly disorienting chase scenes of right hand drive cars and roads.

Paul works extremely well with the other actors/actresses, and I really liked the plot/storyline of the movie.  It's something that I would watch over and over again.

There are times when one or more of the actors' faces are halved since we're essentially looking at a zoomed portion of the original picture rather than the entire original frame.

673241,2,6303515894,"Writer/director Mukunda Michael Dewil gives us yet another boilerplate story who main character is a car chase. Set in Johannesburg South Africa the place may be different but the plot is threadbare. The whole film would have been better if the lead character Michael Woods (portrayed by the hunky Paul Walker) had been allowed to take off his shirt to show the better part of his talent which has been misused in this boring little drama. The remainder of the cast (with the possible exception of Naima McLean and Gys de Villiers is misused or unremarkable.

For those who wish to see a plot out line, the following my provide that information: Michael (Paul Walker) is an ex-con breaking his parole conditions to visit the ex-wife he hasn't seen in 5 years. Hes late and a power outage at the airport rental company mixes up his booking. Driving now, he hears a phone beep but not his phone -a phone inside the rental cars glove compartment. Someone probably left it by mistake. Stuck in traffic now, Michael, scratching around under the car seat, feels something - a gun, the kind of gun you kill people with. The phone rings and Michael is meant to acknowledge receipt of the message. Michael tries to mumble out some explanation that its not his phone, but a rental mix-up. The phone goes dead. The phone rings again. The voice is friendlier now, explaining he got the wrong car: it was meant for an undercover policeman. Michael is relieved hes not in trouble. The detective gives Michael directions to drop off the Minivan and get another vehicle. Michael gets lost, the minivan gets stuck on a bumpy dirt road. Michael struggles to get the vehicle out of a ditch, having to really give it some gas. The minivan pops out of the ditch. But as it does, the back seat flips forward -- something rolling out of the trunk! A woman, bound and gagged. He pulls off her gag. Weak but with enough awareness to see Michael is no threat, she tells him shes been kidnapped, shes got to testify in a major corruption trial. Without her testimony the prosecution has no case. And car chase goes on and on and on.

For those unable to find anything else on the On Demand channels, this will pass the time  but it is definitely headed for obscurity. Grady Harp, November 13",1383955200,2,2264,4.5851851851851855

I did some research and apparently, there are wolves in South Africa, check out [...]  Anyway, good job Paul Walker since you are also the producer of this film.",1374710400,,692,4.4523809523809526
673399,1,6303515894,"I'm a real fan of Paul Walker, but this movie was a disaster from the get go! I'm even surprised that Paul decided to take on this role! He's fabulous in all the Fast & The Furious films! This one was slow and just dragged on to the point I ended up taking a 45 minute nap! For anyone to claim this movie is action packed and a thriller is sheer nonsense! Not recommended!",1374624000,6,372,4.04054054054054
673400,4,6303515894,I was hesitant to purchase this movie because it got so many bad reviews online here. The one review that made me think I should purchase it was because they compared it to the transporter and that was a good film. I went and looked up the trailer and watched it and it looked good. There was a review on here where they said the trailer was good but the film was not. Anyway I purchased it because I like paul walker and I like action movies and the trailer and comparison to transporter all looked good. I must say the movie was good. It kept your attention all the way through it moved and progressed well and was your normal action movie. It may of not had big action but that is because it was a low budget shot in africa film. But the story was good. Paul walker just got out of jail and went to africa to get back with his girlfriend who works at the U.S. embassy there. At the airport there is a mix up with his rental car. As he is driving a phone that is not his beeps with a message on it. He finds the phone and ignores the message. As he is driving and trying to eat a snack and drink he drops his snack and reaches down to get it and finds a gun under the seat. He decides to abandon the car at a junkyard and walk. As he is leaving the car the phone rings and he is told that there was a mix up with the car and that the police where doing a sting operation at the airport and that is why the phone and gun where in it and if he brings the car to a warehouse they will give him another rental and he can go on his way. Well being a american in africa he gets lost on the way to the warehouse and gets the car stuck. Upon trying to free the car up he hits a few bumps and a girl tied up falls out of the boot into the backseat. Not wanting anything more to do with this he opts to just walk away but the girl tells him she found evidence that the chief of police is running a human trafficking ring and they kidnapped her to kill her and keep the evidence from being turned over to the government. So the phone rings again and he is told they will kill his girlfriend if he does not co-operate. He calls the embassy to make sure his girlfriend stays inside but is told she is on her way out to meet someone. He speeds to the embassy and stops the bad guys from getting her and must now get the girl and her evidence to the courthouse in order to save his life and his girlfriends and the kidnapped girl. From here the plot has twist and turns that I will not spoil for you. Is this film the fast and furious? NO. Because it was not a million dollar spectacular it was a low budget film. So yes it does have scaled down action and chases but in my opinion it was a enjoyable and watchable film and I would watch it again and show it to other friends and people on my regular movie nights in the neighborhood. I wanted to write my opinion because not everyone likes the same thing but people should think before writing a review and give a honest opinion before damming a film for no reason at all. Some of these reviewers that hate so much should try to get some funds and a bankable star and make a movie themselves and see how great theirs comes out before damming someone who did just that.,1374537600,50,3206,3.9875583203732505
673609,1,6303515894,"I rented this because I had never seen a Paul Walker movie I didn't like, thanks to Vehicle 19 I can't say that anymore.
As someone else pointed out, the sheer stupidity of the lead character pretty much ruins the whole story. The picture on the cover of the DVD is guy who appears way more competent then that loser in the flick. Thanks to this movie I don't expect to ever rent one that costs more than $4.00 in the future.",1374364800,2,425,4.195121951219512
673610,5,6303515894,Very tight little thriller this. Paul Walker is much better than I though he would be and South Africa looks freaking freaky. Overall a good time had by all.,1374278400,,157,4.448275862068965
673611,1,6303515894,"RipNRiva is right, this guy is just stupid. Everybody knows you wipe the gun down and throw it in the nearest body of water. But that was just the beginning of the stupid that this guy displayed. Godawful!",1374105600,,205,4.421052631578948
673612,1,6303515894,"Im a huge paul walker fan, but this movie baffled me. There are some spoilers ahead but I'm not giving up the plot, The first sign that made me instantly hate this film was the stupidity of the character. When he rents his car and finds a gun in it, after being a recently released convict and alcoholic, wouldn't your first choice be to wipe it down and throw it away? Not here, ill keep it as well as answer random cell phone. It just disappoints me that he was in this film. I had nothing to watch on tv with my dad, so we rented this, and it was a waste of time and money. No enjoyment at all! Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1373328000,,620,4.090163934426229
673613,2,6303515894,"I agree with the previous review that the film was boring. I fell asleep, something I don't usually do while there's a lot of noise going on, but since my sister moved in I've gotten used to it, sort of. However, my sister said it's too political. I don't know where she got this; with her that probably means it's pro-Obama, but in the first thirty minutes or so that I saw before nodding off I have to say that I didn't see this coming.",1373068800,,438,4.1647058823529415
673614,2,6303515894,"I wish that I had read the Amazon reviews for this before paying money for it. On paper the title and plot premise sounded very promising, but the film fails to live up to its potential. The film starts with a car chase then moves into a flashback to show the events that lead up to that moment. I have seen this sort of plot device used really effectively in films, particularly when there are odd elements that precede the flashback that the flashback later explains. However here it really does not add anything - we see the flashback, then the car chase again, and then the conclusion. Not sure what the point of doing it that way is. As other reviewers have pointed out the plot really does not hang together, and the actions of Michael Woods (played by Paul Walker) a damaged ex-con often don't make much sense. The fact that he clearly has a troubled background and seems to have anger management problems, could have made this work, but his problems are underplayed and his response to the situation fairly hard to believe. The whole incident of picking up the wrong car could have set up the whole film, perhaps showing how the mix-up occurs, or the he reaction when it is discovered, but as done, lacks any impact. The fact that it is 'Vehicle 19' is not emphasised and it seems strange to call the film this after such an inconsequential part of the plot. The villains are invisible (just voices on a phone) until the end which again I think decreased the impact. I did like the conclusion to some extent where the reactions of the people in the final showdown did have some suspense, but still not great. This story really has potential to have been a great film but this is not it.",1371945600,7,1694,4.467741935483871
673615,2,6303515894,Interesting story but it had tons of bad acting and boring.  I would only watch this if it was free.,1371686400,5,100,4.0
673616,2,6303515894,"""There was a mix-up. That car was meant to be picked up by one of our undercover police officers."" Michael Woods (Walker) flies to South Africa to see his girlfriend that he hasn't seen in a long time. When he gets to the airport there is a problem with the rental car agency and he grabs another car just to get to his girl as fast as he can. While driving he receives a call from a stranger telling him the car was not meant for him. When he finds a woman in the trunk with a secret that can take down the entire police force Michael is forced into a situation he is not used to. I have to admit that I am not a Paul Walker fan at all so remember that in this review. For the plot and idea of this the movie was pretty slow moving. Do not expect a Fast & Furious type movie. This is more like the Transporter, but slower. The entire movie, except for the first few minutes takes place entirely in a car. Normally that doesn't bother me, but this just didn't have enough action to keep me interested in the one shot. Overall, to me Paul Walker was neither fast nor furious in this, and neither was the movie. I give it a C+.",1371600000,,1125,4.026785714285714
673617,1,6303515894,"Low budget, crappy movie with ""pocket change"" budget.
Paul Walker, shame on you. What is your excuse to play in this crappy movie? Gotta pay your bills? WTF, man? Where is your pride for what you do?

Complete dissapointment. Boooooooooo!",1371081600,3,238,4.95
673618,2,6303515894,"I saw the trailer for Vehicle 19 back near the beginning of the year, and it made me think that it might be alright.  A guy in a different country has a screw up at the rental car place, netting him a mini-van with a hunted hostage in the back of it.  Paul Walker isn't the best actor in the world, but he's surprised me before (Running Scared), so I thought I'd give it a chance.

It's very, very mediocre.  It has the desire to look like a big budget movie, but it's clear that whatever money they had was spent on Walker and one particular car chase scene.  It's 'Phone Booth' like in it's setting (one man in a car the entire time), but it's still very, very boring.  Walker just isn't given enough to work with.

I wouldn't say that this is a terrible flick, but it's really not worth your time with all of the good movies coming out right now.
