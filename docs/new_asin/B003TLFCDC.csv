8405217,3,B003TLFCDC,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>), as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with the same review title used throughout.

REVIEW OF THIS 2008 PRODUCTION OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND . . .
Well, I guess if you were looking to make an argument that Alice in Wonderland cannot be converted to an opera this production might serve as an example. I'm not going to actually make that argument, but this was a tough Alice rendering to sit through for this non-opera buff (I've only seen a couple of operas; Cos fan tutte and The Marriage of Figaro). I actually quite like the opera I've experienced so far, but I haven't tuned in quite enough to really fully appreciate it. So I'm thinking this may be more a production suited to opera buffs who would like to see a rendering of the Alice story in a familiar medium, than for Alice in Wonderland buffs wishing to see the story play out in musical form. In fact, between this Alice opera and the other listed on Amazon from Unsuk Chin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unsuk-Chin-Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B0015XHQYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unsuk Chin:  Alice in Wonderland</a>), if I could only see one of them I would likely choose Unsuk, despite its flaws. There's simply more to appeal to the eye as well as the ear. Fortunately we need not make such a choice, and this performance does have its strong points.

The creator of this opera, Peter Westergaard, chose to forgo the use of an orchestra in his production, choosing instead to use almost solely the actors voices, supplemented only by an English hand bell and a few other sound effects. The result is that what you are listening to a great deal of the time are the high pitched soprano voices of the principal singers, which at times is quite pleasing, but at other times abrasive to my uninitiated ears. Some of the opera is simply spoken, and I actually found that quite pleasing. I think the decision to not employ an orchestra may have been the factor that left folks like me a little tuned out. An instrumental accompaniment would have added balance to the overall sound.

Having said all that there are definitely some things to like here. The opera is set on a single stage and uses hardly any props. Fewer than any production I've seen. But they did something quite interesting to make up for it. They used a rear projection screen to paint the scene behind the actors. When Alice (played by ? year old Jennifer Winn) is in the hall of doors looking for a way out, the screen shows one side of the hallway with all the doors. When Alice imbibes the potion on the table (the table itself is also part of the two-dimensional backdrop), the image on the screen is magnified, giving the impression she is shrinking, When Alice needs to grow in size the projector shrinks the image, making her appear larger than normal. This touch was unique and effective.

The other plus for this production is that they actually follow the book. So rare! I believe they enacted every major passage from Alice in Wonderland; the outing with her sister, falling down the rabbit hole, the hall of doors, the pool of tears, the caucus race, the rabbit's house, the pigeon and serpent and egg passage (rarely presented), the Duchess's house, the encounter with the Cheshire cat, the tea party, back to the hall of doors to get to the garden, the painting of the roses, the croquet game, the gryphon and the mock turtle, the lobster quadrille, and the tart trial. And much of the dialog was sung or spoken verbatim from the book. Nice going folks!

For some reason they swapped genders on the red king and queen. Puzzling. A male played the queen. A female the king. I have absolutely no idea why, but I guess Mr. Westergaard might tell us it had something to do with the tonality of the voices he was looking to express in those two curmudgeons.

That's all I can tell you, except turn on the subtitles!
