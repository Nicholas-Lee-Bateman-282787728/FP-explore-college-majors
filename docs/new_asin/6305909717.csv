  I remember  when I was little (80s) I saw a movie that had a guy that was part bat and flew around  with bay wings but it wasn't  Batman,  finally this is it . This is what I remember.",1522454400,,221,3.595744680851064
7899648,4,6305909717,"Back in the 70s director Eddie Romero made a number of horror films in his native country of the Philippines. They had a few things in common other than the location they were shot. They were all incredibly low budget movies. Almost all of them starred John Ashley as their leading man.  Most played on double bills at drive-ins across the country. And some of them were actually pretty good.

One of those movies was TWILIGHT PEOPLE. I can remember the first time I saw this movie. It was the opening film at the drive-in nearby that showed before the main feature THE DEVILS RAIN back in 1975. For some reason I either didn't have my license yet or a car and my friend, his mom and his aunt and I all went to see these two. I remember thinking it wasn't a bad movie. Since then Ive had the chance to watch it, more often than not on some obscure Roku channel and not in the best shape. So when I heard VCI was going to release the film on blu-ray I was excited to hear it.

Heavy duty plots were never the greatest in these films. This time around adventurer Matt Farrell (Ashley) is taken captive on the high seas by a group of henchmen led by Steinman (Jan Merlin), a pure blooded Nazi Aryan if there ever was one. In charge of kidnapping is Neva Gordon (Pat Woodell).

Farrell is taken to a remote island in the Pacific where Steinman and Gordon march him to a castle while a watchful unseen presence keeps an eye on them from the jungle. Farrell is now the guest of mad scientist Dr. Gordon (Charles Macaulay), the father of Neva. He has plans for Farrell which cant be good but he doesnt provide details, merely talking about how he will make history and that he is the perfect specimen. Steinman would rather Farrell attempt an escape so he could hunt him down, his favorite past time.

Farrell begins to investigate whats happening on the island and soon discovers that Dr. Gordon is creating a new species of man, a hybrid crossing various animals with human beings. An equal opportunist Dr. Gordon has transformed men and women both. On a side note and of particular interest is the fact that Ayesa the Panther Woman is played by none other than Pam Grier who later went on to fame in a number of higher profile films as well as several Blaxploitation films.

It doesnt take long for Neva to fall in love with Farrell and attempt to stop her father from his plans to use him in his experiments. She drugs Steinman, releases Farrell from the cage he was placed in as well as the other hybrids and they head out to escape. When Steinman wakes hes glad for the opportunity he wanted all along, to track down and kill a worthy opponent.

Made in 1972 the movie didn't have access to the CGI created monsters it would have had today. Instead it relies on practical effects and full on special effects make-up for each creature. Doing so on a miniscule budget you would think the end results would reek but in fact they're actually pretty good. Some are better than others. The standout is that of the bat-man hybrid, a full grown man with wings attached between his arms and body. Hes shown flying towards the end of the film and it actually looks fairly decent.

As I said before the script was never the biggest item worked on with these films. That being said they don't fall over the Ed Wood cliff and at least sound like conversations real people might actually have. Ashley does a fine job here though most of his role is to simply play the part of a handsome hero. Woodell is attractive and makes her part believable as well. And Merlin as Steinman is particularly villainous as he threatens Ashley.

The movie was made for just $150,000 and there is little doubt that it made its cost back and more. It played on double and triple bills at drive-ins for years. The fact I saw it my first time three years after it was released shows that. But the film really doesnt have as low budget a feel about it as you would expect. Yes its a bit cheezy at times but its a fun movie as well.

VCI has released the film before but this is the first time Ive seen it released in blu-ray format. Theyre known for these forgotten treasures of the past and theyve done well with this one. The picture is the cleanest Ive seen and the sound well maintained. This version has been remastered to a 2K version from the original 35mm negative in widescreen. Theyre including several nice extras as well here with a full commentary track with film historian Toby Roan, a near hour long interview with director Eddie Romero and the original theatrical trailer.

This is not the cream of the crop in horror movies but it never claims to be. What it does claim to be is a nice little horror film, a PG rated romp with a little bit of blood and a lot of ingenuity. For me after all these years I found it to still be an entertaining movie that I know Ill probably go back and watch again. Leave your expectations at the door and my guess is youll have fun with it as well.",1522281600,,4960,4.362946912242687
7899649,2,6305909717,"Twilight People is a 1972 Filipino science fiction monster movie focusing on Matt Farrell (John Ashley), who is kidnapped from the sea while skin diving and taken to the ominous lair of Dr. Gordon (Charles Macaulay) where he is to become part of the doctors diabolical experiment to create a race of super people. Gordon believes the only way to save mankind is to splice serious animal cells with those of a human to create a new species. The crazed doctor has so far only managed to create hideous creatures.

For an action picture, its slow going at first, as theres an unnecessary overabundance of talky exposition. The film shifts into action mode when Farrell and several of Gordons experiments escape, a group of mercenaries hot on their trail to bring them back, dead or alive.

The film is an amalgam of The Island of Lost Souls and The Most Dangerous Game, but lacks the quality of either of those classics. Made on a minuscule budget, this drive-in flick is entertaining for perhaps all the wrong reasons. The make-up for the creatures is unconvincing, acting is sub par, and the lackluster effects wouldnt fool a child, yet the movie is entertaining specifically because of the movies obvious flaws.

Ashley starred in a slew of Beach Party movies in the 1960s and then turned to producing exploitation movies in the Philippines. Pam Grier appears as Panther Woman Ayesha, howling like a wounded tiger. She has no dialogue here, but would go on to star in a number of blaxploitation films of the 1970s, such as Foxy Brown and Coffy.

Bonus materials on the new Blu-ray release, remastered in 2K from the 35-millimeter negative, include full commentary, video interview with director Eddie Romero, original theatrical trailer, and original TV spots.",1522022400,,1760,4.895973154362416
7899650,3,6305909717,"Sort of like ""Island of Dr. Moreau"". A very low budget ""B"" movie (Make that a ""B-"" movie), so bad that it is actually fun to watch. This film will definitely not scare you, but it is interesting to watch just to see how inane it can get. And very rudimentary make -up for the ""monsters:. So, I kind of recommend it, if you are in the mood to see a horror film that is kind of stupid and funny, but does not intend to be stupid and funny. Pam Greer is in it, as one of the creatures. I don't understand her motivation in this film (I won't elaborate, but you won't understand it either). The bat-guy (again, I won't elaborate) really does make this a ""must-see"" movie, though.",1513468800,2,675,4.2

7899655,5,6305909717,"I first saw this at a drive-in double feature when i was all of 6 years old. Seeing it again I now realize what a bad movie it is, but so what? I still love it! How could I not. An antelope-man, wolf-woman, ape-man, panther-woman & bat-man escape from their mad scientist creator with the help of his own daughter & he-man & former beach bum John Ashley. Pam Grier sexes it up as the panther-woman while the antelope & she-wolf begin their own tender romance. (Imagine the off-spring!) We even get to see the bat-man fly! Plus a surprise human hybrid shows up near the end! (Hint, she probably worries a lot about termites) Yes it's bad & cheap & cheesy. But you know what? Watching it made me feel six years old again.",1245283200,6,719,4.333333333333333
7899656,5,6305909717,Man do I need to buy this!!  I remember a goat-man and a panther woman(played by Pam Grier) and the ending of a bat like man flying with his bat wings.  I have not seen this since I was 7 yrs.old and for all I know this could be AWFUL!!!  But my memory tells me I loved it hence the five stars.  I will be ordering this from Amazon soon for its nice to relive the good times,1237680000,4,374,3.7564102564102564
