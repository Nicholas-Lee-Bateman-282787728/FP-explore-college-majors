What's to like about _any_ sequel to THE BLOB? Simply put, it's much better than the (overrated?) original. More blob for your buck! Lots of familiar faces from '70s TV (including an unbilled Bud Cort of HAROLD & MAUDE fame), an amusing musical score, and plenty of action during the bowling alley finale.
Is it Oscar material? Certainly not -- but it's good clean cheesy fun! Goes together well with an advocado sandwich and some brownies (see the movie and you'll understand).  :)",971568000,3,661,4.798245614035087

1359091,2,B00004W193,"BOTTOM LINE: An ""inside joke"" film that goes for laughs... and fails most of the time. Interesting footnote in horror cinema history, but will likely be a turn off for both Blob purists and mainstream monster movie fans. It does look & sound pretty good on this Blu-ray release though, for whatever that's worth. Personally, I'd rather watch the original with Steve McQueen, or the surprisingly decent '88 remake than this silly sequel. 2 STARS

THE STORY: A piece of the original Blob is accidentally thawed out and the film's cast is routinely devoured.

THOUGHTS: Some decent F/X & occasional inventive camera work are sucker punched by painfully unfunny comedy treatment of the concept, which really kills any momentum the film has. Also, the script is unbelievably bad, even for a low buck horror flick. Not really even fun on a ""so bad it's good"" level. Curious viewers are advised to either rent or stream rather than buy, unless you are a masochist or a diehard fan of this strange sequel.

THE BLU-RAY: Good news for the fans of BEWARE/SON OF THE BLOB. The transfer is pretty strong and there are some decent bonus features that up the value of the film somewhat. Video & audio are strong and the video portion sports a mostly crisp picture. Sound is clean, clear and level. Bonus includes an audio commentary, photo galleries and an alternative main title sequence that is EXACTLY the same except that the title is changed to ""SON OF THE BLOB"" instead of ""BEWARE THE BLOB.""",1486771200,5,1483,4.762645914396887

1359095,5,B00004W193,"Such a hokie and fun movie, fondly remembered from my drive in movie days.  It begins with a cute little kitten bouncing through the grass and the flowers and for an animal lover like myself, I'm thinking, ""Not the kitten!""  The kitten is the best part of this movie.  An ignorant man brings home a thermos clearly marked ""Keep Frozen"" and it gets left out on a kitchen counter.  Of course, the Blob takes over once again.  Teenagers today will probably enjoy the lame script, the hairstyles and the clothing of the 70's.  Those of us from the 70's and 60's will think, what happened to fun horror films?",1481155200,4,604,4.495412844036697

1359097,5,B00004W193,"I am probably the only guy out there who loves this movie. Was it awesome? No. But it's fun to watch for what it is: A film that doesn't take itself too seriously. I remember watching this as a kid and being scared. I have no idea why. The scariest scene is when the blob crawls up the legs of Chester's wife. And the ending when part of the Blob unthaws and creeps down its former self and hits the sheriffs foot and he looks at the camera and says, ""What?!?"" The End?

Does that mean The Blob evolved? We will never know. There was evidently a sequel in the works and in pre-production but it never saw the light of day. Most likely because the movie was not well received.

I just ordered the Blu-Ray and I am looking forward to seeing the film as it was originally intended. The release to DVD back in 2000 was still very dark. You can't see the Ape-Suited guy get eaten when his dune buggy runs into it. I'm sure the commentary is quite interesting. Anyone associated with this films who is still alive barely speak about it when asked.

I will post another review after I watch it.",1477612800,3,1087,4.241545893719807

1359100,1,B00004W193,"Unwatchable.  The original ""Blob"" with Steve McQueen was corny, often stupid, the ""teenagers"" were a joke, the little kid was the absolute worst, and yet you could watch it as a sort of joke, like B-movie at a drive-in -- with enough popcorn and soda (or beer), you could at least sort of enjoy it.  But this 1972 version should be buried in a pit so deep it can never get out.  Not even Joel and the bots could help this abomination.  The acting (I hate to call it that) was on a sort of afternoon TV for kids level.  The characters were like something out of an episode of ""The Brady Bunch.""  The story (I hate to call it that) was absurd.  Even the ""blob"" was ridiculous.  Once in a while you see something on a restaurant menu that looks like it might at least be decent and you think, what the heck, I'll try it, and it turns out to be inedible, you almost throw up.  That's this movie.  Inedible, unwatchable.  I rarely do this, but I tossed it in the trash where it belongs.  I'm forced to give it one star on this site, but trust me, it's about minus 100.",1474329600,2,1063,4.1568627450980395
1359101,3,B00004W193,"In the annals of horror sequel history, 1972's Beware! The Blob (or Son of Blob as it was originally titled) had a reputation as one of the goofiest afterthoughts ever.  Directed by Larry Hagman (I Dream of Jeannie, Dallas) with an eclectic cast of Malibu neighbors and friends, the film is a largely improvised series of sketch comedy situations pitting the hippie generation up against aging authority figures while a surviving piece of the Blob feeds on them both indiscriminately.  As a follow-up to the Steve McQueen original, it's an amateurish mess.  As a piece of post-Easy Rider trash cinema, it's a treasure.

Thawed out by a worker who brings a sample home from the Alaskan pipeline, the Blob begins its all-you-can-eat buffet by snacking on houseflies and kittens before working its way up to human-size portions.  Artists Lisa and Bobby (Gwynne Gilford and Robert Walker, Jr.) barely escape being gobbled up themselves and spend the rest of the movie trying to convince authorities - and their hippie friends - that the threat is real.  Meanwhile, the Blob travels through sewers and drains until trapping nearly the whole town inside the local bowling alley / ice rink combo in a repeat performance of the original's movie theater finale.

With as many almost-famous actors as a '70s disaster movie (Godfrey Cambridge, Burgess Meredith, Cindy Williams, Gerrit Graham, Sid Haig, Carol Lynley, Dick Van Patten and Larry Hagman himself as a mentally impaired handyman), Beware! The Blob is notable just for how many cameos it can stuff into 90-minutes.  And behind the camera, cinematographer Dean Cundey (Halloween, Back the Future, Jurassic Park) got his start as a second unit cameraman in charge special effects.  But somehow all that talent doesn't translate into what you might expect.

From the opening credits, which play out endlessly over a kitten frolicking in a sun-dappled meadow, it's clear that Beware! The Blob was either filmed under the influence of controlled substances or only meant to be watched while enjoying them.  Probably both.  Hagman's camerawork almost defies description; out-of-focus, poorly lit and frequently invading the actor's personal space to the point of distraction.  While the actors themselves (particularly Cambridge and Marlene Clark in the opening scene) are allowed to improvise apocalyptically unfunny situations that stretch even the most masochistic bad-movie fan's patience.

But as the Blob gains weight, the movie gains momentum; even managing to impress with some creative special effects photography.  Lisa and Bobby's close shave inside a pick-up truck is shot with unexpected skill and the big bowling alley massacre uses a clever ""Blob-cam"" that rolls over unsuspecting victims.  All of this uses technology the 1958 version used better (fans would have to wait for the 1988 remake to see some truly updated Blob effects), but creating a convincing menace didn't seem to be at the top of Hagman's agenda.  Beware! The Blob is an underfunded lark made by an actor who never directed another feature film (it was re-issued in the 80's with the tagline ""The film J.R. shot"" to capitalize on the Dallas connection).  With that frame of mind, some snacks and a prescription for medical marijuana, a good time will be had by all.

Kino Lorber's remastered Blu-ray looks unexpectedly terrific, bearing all the scars of an early '70s low-budget quickie, but largely blemish-free all the same.  Extras include an alternate title sequence (with the Son of Blob font), trailer gallery and an essential audio commentary from Richard Harland Smith who covers every actor, anecdote and camera angle with equal enthusiasm but still acknowledges the overall ridiculousness of the film he's charged with discussing.",1472342400,,3767,5.225913621262459

1359110,5,B00004W193,"Like so many before me, I watched ol' Steve battle the big, gooey monster when I was five.  It was 1985, it was a late-nite creature feature, and the family and I settled down to watch it together.  I was fine throughout the movie, really.

Then, when I went to bed later, I could have sworn---could have SWORN---that I saw it oozing silently out of my toy box in the dark.  That was the exact point in my childhood when the inexplicable phobia that every kid gets sooner or later popped up.  Thus went the next several years as I made slight, but to me completely necessary, changes to my routine.  Sleeping with the light on.  Showering while I stared at the air vent the whole time.  And then, 1988 rolled around, with its whole new level of special effects, and, well, let's just say that I was more than happy to wait until I was eighteen before watching that one.

Which is why, really, that I was so shocked to learn years later that there had been a sequel, a direct sequel, to the original.  It didn't ease my mind much that it was labelled as a ""comedy""---after all, what's so funny about watching people get dissolved?  I mean Jesus, did nobody learn what Kevin Dillon had to go through??

That's why I was also immensely pleased with ""Beware the Blob.""  Yes, its dated 70's brand of comedy rolls eyes now, but the special effects---and by extension, the horror---certainly does not.  Unless you're one of those special effects snobs, in which case you wouldn't care anyway.

What that amounts to is this, in short: there is a LOT more blob in this movie, comparable to the 1988 movie, and by extension much more creativity and gooey carnage.  Not gory, mind you, but it is still far more graphic than the original, sometimes surprisingly so.  And a pleasant side effect of that is the characters actually switch from the goofy 70's groovy mindset to the holy-crap-did-that-actually-just-happen-we-need-to-move-now mentality.  This blob means business, folks.  It eats a lot of people---young, old, invalid, male, female, chickens, horses, annoying scout leaders, hippies, squares, fluffy little dogs, cute little kitties, all are fair game.  It corners people.  It surprises people.  Its arrival is preceded by an eerie, shrill note underscored by a pulsing throb that instantly transforms the tone of the scene.  This is not the raging, squealing bully from 1988.  This is a silent, deadly killer.  It'll get you in broad daylight, if it has to...better watch your legs in the tall grass.  And, happily, it makes these appearances with clockwork regularity, moving the film along at a nice pace that belies its lower-budget feel.

Until, of course, it gets too big to give a damn about stealth.  Then, we get to see how big it really is, and not by mere implication like in the first movie.  By the climax, when the stoners are scared spitless (or dead) and the cops are being devoured, we actually switch from rooting for the crimson goo to the handful of unlikely heroes  because they've stopped being annoying.

If you wanted to hate this film, you would because of its screwball comedic elements, in which case I wouldn't blame you.  If I dislike anything about it, it's because that same comedy creates such a discordant tonal shift between the comedy and the horror.  But really, I can overlook that, because in the end, the horror of The Blob is timeless and knows no decade, despite the best efforts of the 70's to make it otherwise.",1418256000,7,3454,4.722408026755853
1359111,4,B00004W193,"As with any sequel, this can easily be said to have a great number of scenes and events that are predictable. But then again, what else can one expect? Still, I think that this movie was definitely not made in vain. Not that it was supposed to be able to match up with the original, but it still has that proper sense of creepiness that any horror movie should have.

A pipeline worker returns from the arctic with a piece of the blob that was frozen at the end of the previous film. It thaws out, therefore releasing the fragment which then goes on to consume mass quantities, regenerating itself to gigantic proportions in the process. As with the first movie, it is a young couple who struggle to convince everyone of the danger, and, as anyone can predictably guess, the blob meets its fate when it is frozen, this time, at a skating rink. As predictable as all of this may be, it is still entertaining to watch, and still gives off the proper sense of creepiness and tension in the air.

All in all, this movie is every bit as much of a masterpiece as the original, predictable or not. If you enjoyed the original, then there is no reason not to give this one a try.",1416355200,4,1171,4.342465753424658

1359115,5,B00004W193,"There are 2 different versions of this DVD.  One with an Image Entertainment opening logo on it and one with an RJE Entertainment logo that leads into a different Image Entertainment logo.  The disc label is different.  Image's is gray while RJE's is black.  The Image release came in a cheap cardboard case, like early Warner Brothers DVD releases.  RJE's is in a standard plastic DVD case.  Otherwise, the 2 DVD's contents are the same.  Same menus, same movie content.

The downside to this DVD release is all you get is the movie.  Nothing else.

The movie itself I find to be quite enjoyable.  It's just as good as The Blob and in some ways is better.  The Blob itself is a much better prop this time around.  The sequel makes the titular monster blood red, as if it has absorbed the blood of its victims.  The music is very good.  Like The Blob, Beware!  The Blob has a great opening title theme.  No lyrics, but some really good stings of music.  This movie is loaded with stars that Larry Hagman was able to convince (Some might say trick.) into being in the movie.  An added bonus for me is a cameo by my favorite actor, Burgess Meredith.

The finale of this movie is superior to The Blob.  The location is much larger, being set in a bowling alley with an adjoining rink.  It allows for more freedom of movement than the confined movie theater and diner of the previous movie.  This sequel even allows for a little ""stunt"" work.  It even give the opportunity for the Blob to be a little more active as it is climbing some ropes.  While it's never actually shown going up the ropes, just sticking on them, it still gives an impression that the Blob is moving.

If you like The Blob, you should like its sequel.  If you like the sequel, then, this DVD unfortunately doesn't give you any extras, not even a film trailer.  However, it does give you the movie in a decent enough presentation.  The DVD is single layer, so the video could have been better as a double layer release.

1359118,4,B00004W193,"Roger Corman once mentioned in an interview something to the effect that when he looked in on the filming of a comedy, he knew everything was all right if the cast and crew were joking and laughing and having a good time. In his experience, that energy would translate to the screen and the picture would be funny and enjoyable.

Although Corman did not produce this particular picture, ""Beware! The Blob"" looks to me to be exemplary of this kind of thinking. The cast was obviously enjoying the experience of making the film, and we, the audience, get the benefit. A certain sense of giddy frivolity is evident.

This movie is not a work of genius.  It's not trying to be serious at all; this is a cinematic Slurpee or a hot-dog for the mind.  It is not for the stodgy or inflexible viewer.  It's for the viewer who wants to relax for a little while and have a few laffs!  It's a horror comedy made in the early 70's--you should know what to expect and what not to expect.

I would say this sequel to the (excellent) ""The Blob"" is played half-seriously, and that's why I find it so strange and refreshing. Sometimes it's a raucous farce. Sometimes it's straight horror. And oddly enough for a 70's film, it seems to know when it is being one or the other, and keeps true to whatever it is at that moment. It's not nearly as badly made as many of its detractors claim.

Watch it for the pea soup-thick 70's atmosphere. You'll feel as if you've entered another world. Watch it for the inventive low-budget special effects. A few shots look pretty nice even today. Watch it for the scene with the bald would-be victim guy in the bathtub, who throws the phone through the window when he sees the gelatinous menace oozing under his bathroom door, and who is then seen running starkers through the streets, shouting, while funny music plays. ""Beware! The Blob"" is extremely goofy, exciting, brightly-colored fun stuff. It is extremely representative of the era in which it was made.

1359121,2,B00004W193,"This completely unnecessary sequel has all of the trappings of a lame made-for-TV B-movie with none of the same campy fun of the original. The last remaining specimen of the gooey monstrosity is released by a clumsy researcher in her suburban home, where The Blob begins to consume everything around it as it reconstitutes into its former size! In order to achieve this effect, the filmmakers apparently had to buy out all of the remaining Jell-O molds in town, since the creature is no more convincing than the giggly dessert gone mad. As the plot meanders around aimlessly in the wake of the creature's destructive path, the audience is left guessing who it is exactly that they are supposed to be following, since the film cycles through no less than three sets of lead characters before settling on two incompetent teens. Using stock characters, empty dialog, and a regurgitated plot in order to resuscitate the creature fails to breath new life in to the series, and BEWARE proves to be an utter failure within the opening moments of the film.

1359122,3,B00004W193,"For diehard SciFi fans only. I saw ""The Blob"" when it was new, fresh and really scary. Loved the re-make, but never saw this sequel to the original. Kind of a period hoot, but those with serious expectations for plot, character or good production values will be disappointed. Fun to watch, see the very period costumes, and marvel at how much of a movie you can make with so little in the way of cast, sets, talent, and special effects. A must-see for blob fans, a pass for others.

Reeaders need to understand that my standards for these kinds of movies are very permissive - I also like ""Caltiki the Immortal Monster"", ""X the Unknown"" and ""Night of the Blood Beast"", all alternative blobby kind of monster flicks of questionable cinematic value.

Now that I've seen it, it will probably languish in obscurity until one of my descendents unearths it from wherever old DVDs end up.",1256688000,,881,4.641025641025641

1359124,2,B00004W193,"Beware! The Blob (Larry Hagman, 1972)

I was jaded very, very early. I used to boast to my grade-school pals that I could eat ham sandwiches while watching The Exorcist. (Remember, kiddies, when I was in grade school, The Exorcist was still in theaters.) Movies just don't scare me. With, that is, a few notable, and mostly entirely unjustifiable, exceptions. Beware! The Blob is one of those. I didn't sleep voluntarily for months after I first saw this movie on the Friday late-night creature feature. To this day, I have no idea what it was that scared the tar out of me so badly thirty years ago. Now it's a whole other story; Dick van Patten's acting is a large part of it, to be sure.

The story: a geologist (Godfrey Cambridge, best remembered these days as Gravedigger Jones) brings back a sample from above the arctic circle (funny, I thought they took the beast the other way in the Steve McQueen movie...). Through various bits of forgetfulness, the sample is left to thaw on the counter, and the blob gets out to wreak havoc on another small town. Lisa Clark (Satan's School for Girls' Gwynne Gilford) stops in to see Chester just as the blob is devouring him, having already finished off his family, and goes screaming to her boyfriend Bobby (Easy Rider's Robert Walker) and the cops, neither of whom believe there's a big one-celled eating machine on the loose until, of course, it's entirely too late.

Now, I will start off by saying that, yes, this is an entirely awful movie. Technically, there is not a single redeeming quality about it. The acting sucks. The directing sucks. The lighting sucks. The special effects suck. The sets suck, which is pretty impressive given the number of location shots. The entire movie sucks, well and truly. But that is part of its considerable charm, for it pushes through the envelope of suck and achieves that cheesy greatness that so few films manage. Dick van Patten's obsessive Scoutmaster is pure comic gold. A couple of hobos who end up being lunchmeat for the blob are played by (director) Larry Hagman and an uncredited Burgess Meredith. Carol Lynley, Shelley Berman, Bud Cort, Byron Keith, Randy Stonehill (yes, that Randy Stonehill, playing a pot-crazed free-love-type guitarist), Gerrit Graham... it's as much fun playing spot-the-cameo as it is trying to figure out how badly the next scene is going to mangle the fifties monster-movie tropes it never even attempts to break out of.

I grant you, you have to have a certain special sense of humor to really grasp the greatness of Beware! The Blob. If, however, you recognize Night of the Lepus as the timeless piece of filmmaking it truly is, then I cannot recommend Beware! The Blob highly enough for your refined palate. An absolute keeper. **",1199318400,9,2761,4.794117647058823

1359127,2,B00004W193,"Though advertised on the back of the box art as a ""sequel"" to the 1958 film The Blob, this film is in no way a sequel but esentually a remake. Beware! The Blob is as much a sequel to the original Blob as the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is to the original. There is no mention of the events of the original film what-so-ever. Now that we got that out of the way lets talk about Beware! The Blob. The premise of a 70's remake of the original sounds exciting, but sadly this film does not live up to expectations. First off Beware! The Blob is terribly shot and directed., which hence gives the film a very amaturish feel. Many of the pull back camera shots are shaky and there seems to be no flair in Larry Hageman's direction. The story also has its problems. First of all is how the Blob is brought into the story. Some man in the begining that is a geologist (though this character definitly does not fit the role( supposidly finds a ""sample"" his crew dug up in the ground and stores it in his freezer. Naturally it thaws and the ""blob"" is unleashed The problem is that no hwere in teh story is there talk of it being ""alien"" or ""human made"" like in the other two fersions of the film (One in 1958 and 1988). The blob is just there! The story also has many useless moments and senarios. Take the boy scout senerio for instance. There is no point to these scenes with the boy scouts outher than to fill up time. Also many of hte characters just stupidly throw themselvesat the blob. One cop shoots, try's to flee, falls, then is eaten. One guy even has the gale to drive his car into the blob even when he ovviously sees it from a far away distance. These characters drove me nuts!! Director Larry Hagman also doesn't know whether to treat this as a straight horror film or a spoof of the genre. Htere are many scenes that are scary and suspensful (such as when the blob covers a car with occumpents trapped inside) but there are also many scenes of shear campyness that throws the movie off balence. hte music score was also quit terrible and actually ruins what are supposed to be suspensful scenes. The special effects aen't  too bad, especially for the time, but many of them are quite outdated. This film is also not aided by the numerous bad titles it is under. Beware! The Blob...come on. This was also released as Son of Blob (that was the title of it when I first saw it), which is actually worse than the title Beware! The Blob. If you liked the original Blob, you might want to tcheck this film out  just for kicks by renting it or buying it real cheap. Otherwise your best bet is to go for the 1988 remake.",1083628800,5,2636,4.280561122244489
1359128,3,B00004W193,"Cindy Williams, Shelley Berman, Dick van Patten, Burgess Meredith and other familiar faces get together in this direct sequel to the original Steve McQueen movie.  The original blob was taken to the frozen north.  An oil worker finds something strange in the permafrost and brings it home where his wife doesn't want it in the freezer.  Well, it thaws, and after a fly and a kitten, the creature moves on to human prey.
This is a strange film with camp pushed to its limits.  Nothing is safe from the creature in this small town and nothing is same from the film makers.  Hippies, hairdos, hobos, and the strangest barber since Monty Python's Michael Palin are just the tip of the iceberg is this strange film.  There is even a clip from a certain Steve McQueen film.  It fits into the blob scenarios the same way that Godzilla vs The Smog Monster fits with the rest of the Godzilla films.
The effects are pretty good (foreshadowing those of the remake) but the acting and pacing make it more like a sketch comedy version.  This is like a case of the moth and the flame, you know it is bad for you but you are still drawn to it.  Check it out.",1083628800,29,1143,4.404761904761905
1359129,3,B00004W193,"This camp horror schlock is a heck of a lot of fun to watch (think Saturday night drive in) once you learn that it was Larry Hagman's low budget ""home movie"" attempt at cashing in on the Blob-ularity of the original.  All the celebs on board (Cindy Williams, gorgeous Carol Lynley, Dick Van Patten, Godfrey Cambridge, etc etc) are all appearing because they were Hagman's Malibu neighbors and he said, ""Hey!

1359130,2,B00004W193,"I always liked the original Blob with Steve McQueen, so I was curious about this movie.  This movie is just one big schlockorama.  From the pathetic plot, the lousy acting, the crummy directing, to the cheesy music, it was pretty painful viewing throughout.  I do realize this was sort of a comedy homage to the original, but knowing that didn't help much.  I will say that the special effects were okay, the blob oozing here and there, consuming everything in it's path.  By halfway through the movie, I was rooting for the blob to eat everyone, including those responsible for making the movie.  Some parts were fun, and I liked the guy who owned the bowling alley, as he was such a square and had some funny moments.  I also liked the guy at the beginning of the movie.  He had a few funny parts, like when he  was drinking beer, a lot of beer, and decided to make use of a common household object to assist him in consuming mass quantities of beer.  These brief moments of mirth couldn't really carry the movie, though.  Everything about this movie seemed thrown together, and then it was thrown at the unsuspecting public.  As bad as this movie was, it was also sort of fun and hokey.  And maybe I missed it, but I didn't see what happened to Dick Van Patten....he played a really annoying scoutmaster of a boyscout troop, and we did find out later in the movie that he got consumed by the blob at some point, but I didn't see it.  I was sorry I missed that, but I am afraid to watch the movie again to look for that part.  Too much cheese can be a bad thing.  So, when watching this movie, just sit back and try not to think too much.  Just let it ooze over you.",1051488000,5,1668,4.294871794871795
1359131,3,B00004W193,"When Larry Hagman came back from acting purgatory to become a superstar as J.R. Ewing on ""Dallas,"" most folks saw this as being a big step up from being on ""I Dream of Jeanine.""  But Hagman's most pathetic moment really game with this 1972 film that he directed.  ""Beware! The Blob"" (a.k.a. ""Son of the Blob"") is both a sequel to and a spoof of the 1958 Science Fiction Drive-In class ""The Blob,"" starring Steve McQueen.  He is long gone, and this time it is Robert Walker, Jr. (Charlie X on ""Star Trek"") who gets the responsibility of fight the big bad blob.  The plot is essentially the same as the original.  An unsuspecting guy brings back a sample of frozen goo from Alaska, where he was working on the pipeline.  The goo thaws, starts with a fly, works through a cat, and then an entire family.  The devouring is witnessed which means the heroine, Lisa (Gwynne Gilford) and her boyfriend, Bobby (Walker) spend time trying to convince the local sheriff that a giant red blob thing is eating people.  Meanwhile the giant red blob thing is eating everybody, which pretty much means a complete cross-section of Seventies stereotypes.
Hagman must have called in a lot of I.O.U.'s because Burgess Meredith, Dick Van Patten, Godfrey Cambridge, and Shelly Berman all show up to be consumed by the red goo (watch for Hagman's cameo as a bum).  If there was ever an attempt to actually make a serious horror film here, then it must have been abandoned early on in the production.  Very few of the actors seem to be taking this thing seriously and Walker just does not have the heft to be the manly hero.  As a horror film ""Beware! The Blob"" is not scary and as a spoof it is not funny beyond the sophomoric level of the decidedly lame.  The death scenes are not particularly creative, although the special effects are really not that inept, but you get the feeling some of these victims are happily throwing themselves into the giant red blob thing.",1049846400,6,1945,4.573487031700288
1359132,5,B00004W193,"A classic mound of compost! It's best if you look at BEWARE! THE BLOB, not as a sequel to THE BLOB, but as a drug-induced documentary of the 1970's. I saw this in the theater when it came out. There is NO better time capsule of the 70's!  Director Larry Hagman is a genius! Chester (Godfrey Cambridge) brings back a sample of the blob from the frozen wastes where it had been forgotten about since the 50's (see original film.), and keeps it in his freezer. It's in his wife's way, so she puts it on the counter to thaw! The top of the container pops off, the blob eats a fly, then a kitten, then Chester and spouse. This just makes the blob bigger and hungrier. Ah, so many hippies to eat, so little time! The thing devours both Cindy Williams (yep, THAT Cindy Williams) and Carol Lynley!! You'd think that these two groovy chicks would be enough for any self-respecting blob, but no, it goes on! It gobbles up Larry Hagman, his brother, and Burgess Merideth! On a chicken farm! The funniest scene involves a barber (Shelly Berman) and his long-haired customer. That is, unless you count the naked guy running down the street. This film is actual proof of why the 70's were so much fun. The big bowling alley finale is pure gold! I guess you had to be there, man...",1047600000,9,1266,4.3872340425531915

There was one scene that was very impressive,which was the scene with the shadow of the blob on the barn. The shadow indicated how big the blob got since the beginning of the film. The blob ate all the animals and then the three hippies. Burgess Meredith and Larry Hagman were two of the hippies in that scene. The cast of the film is likeable and there are plenty of veteran actors like Richard Webb and Shelley Berman. For its time,Beware! The Blob was scary! Something like this blob can make its way to earth someday. No one knows for sure what is out there in outer space. This creature keeps moving or rolling along with no eyes or hands or legs. It is a shapeless mass of life-form. What the creature looks like makes it a scary creature. This movie is far better than the ridiculous movie made in 1988. That movie has too many special effects with stupid scenes. Beware! The Blob is a decent low-budget horror/comedy that is worth seeing! These old movies can`t be beat!

1359135,3,B00004W193,"Just like the other reviews, I too remember watching this on  a Saturday afternoon matinee on cable access in or around 1983. This was the first Blob movie I had seen I remember it scaring the pants off of me. So when the advent of VCR's became a hip thing in the mid-80's, I sent myself on a quest to find this movie. Of course, nobody had it. And everybody that I asked about it looked at me like I had three heads. Although the movie never really went anywhere, I thought it was a good attempt to pick up where the original left off. A ""What -if"" if you will, ""What if someone found the Blob and accidently unfroze it?"" Enter Chester Hargis. After it unthaws, revitalizes itself via a curious fly, then absorbing the family kitten, and the wife of Chester sees it crawling up her legs and she's screaming in fear and pain, and then it's too late. Then the fun begins. My only major complaint after it was re-released last year was that for the price, it should have included commentary from any of the surviving cast members and there has to be some behind the scenes footage just like the re-release of the orignal Blob has in it. I'm sure Larry Hagman knows this was not his finest hour, but it's nothing to be ashamed of either. There are enough ""Blob-Heads"" like me out there that would have liked more insight on how this movie was made, finding out about the cast, etc... If you look close enough, in the ice rink when Bobby is climbing across the ropes above the rink to reach the breaker box, you see the Blob climbing up the opposite rope to try and stop him. When he releases the rope to foil its plan, the Blob becomes angry and it tries to pull the booth off the wall. Look to the background, where the Blob is covering the booth, in that scene it is clearly a sheet covered in silicone gel because it ""waves"" while its trying to eat his girlfriend and that annoying business owner. What made the movie scary is that you didn't always seethe monster. You knew it was there and I think a mental scare is better than actual reality scare in the movies. Knowing somebody is being devoured but not actually seeing them get devoured is much more frigtening to me. Think about it. Overall, I think this movie is really good. I agree that it is not an academy award winner, but I can't think of one horror flick that was. Come on, Larry! Get back in there and do a special edition ""Beware!

7924275,2,B00004W193,"Baffling and barely competent, ""Beware! The Blob"" (aka ""Son of Blob"") is the belated low-budget sequel to the 1958 Steve McQueen classic that nobody asked for. Directed in an off-the-cuff nature by first-time director Larry Hagman (aka J.R. of ""Dallas"" fame), the titular ooze makes its way across a small town after being unwittingly unleashed by a careless oil-worker. Corny, hokey and -- as it would turn out -- mostly improvised, it would prove to be Hagman's final film. Watching it today, it is all too obvious why.

Within the first five minutes, a ridiculous and slightly meandering tone is set that unfortunately plagues the film until its end. Granted, the film does generate a bit of incidental fun and good humor (""Can I have my lighter back? Can I have my lighter back?"") as it plods along, but even the most generous of viewers may have trouble making it to the finish line. The film is low, low (almost no) budget, and the cast is mostly made up of other familiar TV faces/friends of the director. No one appears to be taking the whole thing seriously, which gives the audience permission to do the same. Problem is, you won't have even a fraction of the fun watching this as the cast and crew had making it.

On the upside, the blob's effects are (mostly) convincing. Nobody -- neither kitten not cool-cat hippies -- is safe from the amorphous antagonist, and you may be surprised to find that cinematographer Dean Cundey (""Halloween,"" ""Jurassic Park"") had a hand in the special effects. Sometimes it appears as if the slimy scoundrel really is covering cars and coming out of sinks, and sometimes it just looks like strawberry jelly smeared across somebody's face.
