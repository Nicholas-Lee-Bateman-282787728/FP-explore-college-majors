8389928,5,B0036EHAKU,"This is one bawdy and vulgar (in a good way), Spanish sex-comedy. ""historia de ""S"" (""The Story of ""S"" from 1978), was directed by Francisco Lara Polop. While fashion-designer 'Sebastian' (legendary Spanish comical-actor Alfredo Landa), was trying to rejuvenate his sex-life (with wild fantasies), he would love for nothing more than to have his beautiful but conservative wife 'Antonia' (Sara Lezana) reciprocate in kind. But 'Sebastian' must first go through the proverbial ""wringer"" in order to get what he wants!

 This sex-comedy is a true ""feast for the eyes"", with non-stop flash of womanly-flesh on display: the sexy and beautiful Adriana Vega ('Clara'), voluptuous beauty Silvia Aguilar ('Irene'), Sara Lezana, etc. Especially Adriana Vega, Silvia Aguilar, and an unknown actress that played 'Roma' the maid. Gentlemen, if you do not suffer the joys of a particular type of muscular-discomfort, after viewing the bountiful and generous attributes (bellisima ""conchas peludas"") of these lovely ladies; please, go straight to the emergency-room and get yourselves checked-out! All kidding aside, this sex-comedy will not disappoint. Even the lowbrow humor was pretty funny (of course, if you don't speak Spanish, this is an irrelevant point). One of the better sex-comedies (just because you've seen one, doesn't mean you've seen them all) I've seen in a long time. And as I always stress, if you're mature and understanding enough to know that, there is really nothing offensive about these films, except perhaps our misconceptions around them. This one is truly for every serious collector of sex-comedies. With that being said---enjoy the flair and nostalgia from a bygone era!

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, Filmax has fully restored the film, as part of their retrospective: ""Cine ""S"" de la Transici&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola."" PAL format, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 89 mins. (I bought the DVD through Amazon.es.)

Love and Peace,
