5740670,5,B00CU2QTGU,"I stumbled onto this on Netflix and was instantly hypnotized by the Frankie the Fixer character. The show follows a Mafia underboss from New York to Lilyhammer, Norway as he is put into a quasi witness protection relocation of his own choosing. He incorrectly thinks that nobody will ever he find him there. I won't give away the plot because one the shows many plot lines has the mob trying to get him.

I read where one person couldn't understand the show because they didn't speak the language. I watched season one on my television using Roku, which for some reason doesn't have the english subtitles. I watched season 2 on my laptop which did have the subtitles and was very good at allowing you follow the story line much better. If you are fan of Van Zandt in the Sopranos, you will love him in this show. Same character, just thrown into a different storyline and written to be humorous.

The final episode of season 2  is priceless as the world of Lilyhammer and the Sopranos pass each other in the daylight with actors from both shows turning up. There is even Dj vu scene where the characters of Lilyhammer are driving into NY with Tony Soprano SUV listening to the theme music from the opening of the Sopranos. (Woke Up This Morning"" by Alabama 3). And Frankie tells them to turn it off.

I was never a big Netflix fan but they have really started to turn out some excellent television shows to watch. Lilyhammer is one of those shows and this is worth buying or subscribing to watch!",1388016000,,1496,4.509225092250922

I am going to order the rest of the series, & I can't wait to see it",1387843200,3,98,3.5
5740672,3,B00CU2QTGU,"The show has great promise, but if you can' t understand the dialogue you miss 90% of the fun. If the producers had included English subtitles, this show would be a runaway best seller. Really too bad and very short sighted of the producer.",1387324800,4,240,4.4772727272727275
5740673,5,B00CU2QTGU,Just discovered Lilyhammer tonight on NetFlix streaming. Not only loved the show but just now realized Steven Van Zandt is the guitarist of Bruce Springsteen's Band. How many people even realize this? Van Zandt revamps his mafia character from Soprano's but adds a bit more humor to it. The writing is fantastic. In a world with so many awful TV series out there. This one is a gem. Check it out!,1387065600,2,396,4.591549295774648
5740674,4,B00CU2QTGU,"Good Netflix series for season 1, but when we tried to watch first episode of season 2, could only understand about 25% of the show because we don't live in Minnesota and speak Norwegian. The producers need to put in some English subtitles if they want to keep the American audience. Plot too hard to follow when so much of the show is spoken in that Norwegian tongue.",1386979200,5,368,4.426470588235294
5740675,4,B00CU2QTGU,A quirky show that has such a ridiculous premise it actually works. Jolting transplant from the NY Mafia to the placid slopes and valleys of Lillehammer. (I'm not sure why they changed the spelling). Van Zandt tries a little too hard but his role as a lead actor picks up steam over the 8 episodes. I'm looking forwarding to Season 2.,1386806400,,334,4.491803278688525
5740676,5,B00CU2QTGU,"Hi, I liked this a lot. Van Zandt reprises his role as Silvio from the Soprannos but in a different incarnation. It's funny and ""Johnny"" sprinkles his dialog with little ""remarks"";like when he refers to a local cab driver as Travis Bickle. Cultural armageddon ensues when gangster colides with the polite Norwegians. I'm looking forward to Season 2.",1386633600,13,349,5.0344827586206895
5740677,4,B00CU2QTGU,"MINOR SPOILERS:

""If I didn't watch the Olympics in 94!"" Frank ""The Fixer"" opts for witness protection in Norway. An important distinction is that Lilyhammer is not a program about the Mafia or even crime. What the show is about and what makes it work is the cultural differences. Steven Van Zandt to his credit does not try to create a new mob persona and plays Frankie as he played Sil.

While the cultural differences are the base of the show, it is the subtle and not so subtle comedic moments (including the facial expressions of Steven Van Zandt) that make the show a pleasure to watch. Whether it is the jail cell that looks like a college dorm room (along with a guard that apologizes for locking the door) or the Employment Counselor that is genuinely offended when Frankie (AKA Johnny) attempts to bribe to get a liquor license, so that he can purchase a bar, the ancillary cast of characters keep the show fresh.

I watched all 8-episodes in 2-sittings. While YMMV, the show is uniquely originally.

Season 2 is in the works.",1375401600,29,1036,4.583783783783784

I'm always behind the viewing curve since I only get free movies from the local library; so glad they had this, and hope they purchase the succeeding seasons.",1477526400,,272,4.76595744680851

5740681,5,B00CU2QTGU,FUN AND MORE FUN!  I thoroughly laughed my way through Season 1 and hope that Seasons 2 and 3 will be available on DVD for U S.  A.  distribution.  I do not know why NETFLIX took it off their listings.  AVID READER,1462838400,,214,4.0
5740682,3,B00CU2QTGU,Good show. But Tough to read the thing. - it's mainly subtitles. Good show but you have to really watch it,1455926400,,106,4.095238095238095
5740683,1,B00CU2QTGU,hated it.  didn't watch more than an hr,1453939200,,39,3.875
5740684,5,B00CU2QTGU,Amazing show. I really want to own the rest of the series I've seen every episode of all of them now has a few of the characters from the Sopranos in it. I'm a female and I loved this Show,1453766400,,188,3.725
5740685,3,B00CU2QTGU,"Steve Van Zandt has done so many movies and series about mobsters, his is almost a poster boy of a NYC wise guy.  In this series, he plays wise guy is exile.  After retting on the (new) mob boss he did not see ""eye to eye"" with, he chooses to leave US and move t Lilyhammer, Norway.  So you probably get  a hint - this is a parody on what it is to be a mobster, immigrate to another country and have to adept to their ""talk therapy"" approach on resolving the social issues such as having teenagers deface building walls with graffiti, talking to elementary school bullies on how it is not ""nice"" to torment their school mates, adjusting to conventional ways of getting things done where everything is done according to the ""book"" and government officials are not  prone to bribe unless they are caught in their indiscretion so they can be blackmailed for favors.  It is just out of this word to see parody on making a difficult person ""an offer he cannot refuse"" that is pure mafia style straight from the ""Godfather"" movie.

It is not very strong story and it does get lukewarm at time, but it is original and for that reason worth watching.  yes, I am hooked and I will be looking for season 2 because I just like these characters no mater how bad, silly or delusional they are.",1449446400,,1280,4.371308016877637

5740692,5,B00CU2QTGU,"Lilyhammer is a nice little Norwegian TV show, the language spoken switches between Norwegian and English, English subtitles appear when Norwegian is spoken.  This adds to the authenticity of the show, I'm sure someone in America was tempted to dub the Norwegian's voices with English speaking voiceovers, but it works so much better in its native tongue.  Steven Van Zandt plays a stereotypical from one of the Eastern top corner states of America, underworld boss.  He is a little bit cartoony to be believable but he nails the mannerisms of the stereotype from his facial expressions that you've seen in the God Father and other mob movies to his mafia style haircut and insistence on wearing Italian loafers.  I didn't realise until I read other reviews on this page that he was actually in The Sopranos as I haven't seen too many of those episodes but he definitely has the mob boss stereotype down pat.  Lilyhammer is a culture clash, fish out of water type show, as our New York mafia boss, now on the Witness Protection Program tries to blend in with the locals.  Once you've learnt to do things the mob way, it is hard to let those habits go, especially when dealing with those who are annoying you or making your life difficult with their rules.

Obviously the fictional townfolk of Lilyhammer are different to the real Lillehammer (spelt different) people, the town is portrayed as a lot smaller and less populated for one.  But name an American, Australian or UK production that has ever accurately portrayed whatever city or town you live in when basing a series or movie there?  So for me this isn't a big deal and the other characters are all played by Norwegian actors.  Lilyhammer isn't quite as Fargo like as I had anticipated but it is still a very good dark humour TV show.  They did sort of wrap things up at the end of Season 1, I'm guessing they didn't know for sure the show would be renewed when they wrote the script, but if you only wanted to risk a mental investment in one season you could leave satisfied with the final episode.  But it's good enough you'll probably order the 2nd season when you reach there though.

My only criticism of the concept is that he picks up fluent Norwegian much too fast and the violence towards the punk on the train and a few others at times should have been a bit heavier to get their co-operation, which happens a little too easily to be realistic.",1433376000,,2413,4.596736596736597
5740693,5,B00CU2QTGU,I love it on many levels. First of all I laughed myself silly but there is much more than laughs. The occasional violence seem to fit in with the comedy and the story line never lets up. The nice photography and acting are all first rate. If you want to watch a program that makes you smile non-stop this one is it.,1431907200,,315,4.096774193548387

5740695,5,B00CU2QTGU,"The story perfectly portrays an odd set of circumstances in a dramatic, quirky and funny way. I didn't care for all the subtitles, but as another reviewer pointed out, it keeps you on your toes. If you want to see something different and unpredictable, this is a must see. Steven Van Zandt rocks it out of the park (no pun intended) :-)",1429833600,,336,4.435483870967742
5740696,5,B00CU2QTGU,I loved this series. Jaw dropping episode endings. Perfect combination of drama and humor. You have to deal with subtitles...keeps you on your toes. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!! When will season 2 come out on blu-ray?,1429488000,,208,4.9714285714285715
5740697,2,B00CU2QTGU,"Two words that don't seem to belong in the same sentence: Norwegian and humor. A low-budget culture-clash comedy starring Steve Van Zandt, who doesn't really pull it off. Not very believable and very little eye candy to distract you while you are getting bored with the plot. If you're hoping for something on the level of the Sopranos, please don't waste your money.",1429488000,,367,4.841269841269841

5740700,4,B00CU2QTGU,"This was the first season of Lilyhammer, and  my husband and I enjoyed it. Steven Van Zandt  of The Sopranos is very funny as a fugitive in the Witness Protection Program who decides to go to norway to hide out.",1426636800,,211,4.25
5740701,5,B00CU2QTGU,"This is a great series,in fact it can compete with 'The Sopranos drama series..  Steve Van Dandt did an excellent job portraying  Mob Boss Frank 'The Fixer' Tagliano ,he was exeptional, it also shows that he too is competent and talented to take a lead role as James Gandolfini did in The Sopranos. The Norwegian crew also did an excellent job of acting. The Norwegian scenery and general appearance is beautiful. The story lines and plots are very appealing and facinating. It's really a great show ...",1426636800,,503,4.7701149425287355

5740706,5,B00CU2QTGU,"I bought this for my mom, who does not stream N*****x. She's thrilled to have it, even if it does poke fun at Norwegians. (My family there loves the show also.) I wasn't sure what to expect of Steven Van Zandt in this as his Sopranos mobster was a much darker character, but his transition to comedy is seamless. I just finished watching Season 3 - he and the show just get better and better. I hope he stays in Norway for several more seasons to come. Skol!",1423612800,,458,4.215909090909091
5740707,5,B00CU2QTGU,"For me, Tagier, Frankie/Johnnie's chosen Norwegian right-hand man, steals the show.  He is the most lovable, clueless, wanna-be Goodfella, but his big heart and conscience won't quite let him.. You can watch the whole series with the sound off and still be amazed by Trond Fausa's incredibly indepth characterization ..facial expressions,..body language, schtick, etc.  He is the show as far as I'm concerned.",1423094400,,409,5.476190476190476

5740719,5,B00CU2QTGU,"i have been a stevie van zandt fan because of the E street band and barely remember him from the sopranos, he didn't seem to have a lot of face time or line, but Lilyhammer made me a believer. he's also extremely talented; he wrote the songs, the script, and i think he also directed it. amazingly he had never acted until they grabbed him for the Sopranos.

at first the premise seems absurd but as you see him partially adapt to the Swedish way of life you laugh. i should have said that he took his new york gangster way of life, continued to do things that way but masked it with the Swedish way. he outwits his neighbor, the female police captain who knows something is going on but can't nab him.

i laughed a lot through this because van zandt does such an over the top but realistic parody of a ""made guy"". between his faces, clothes, phrases, and voice he's a marvel. His Swedish friends start using his phrases albeit incorrectly at times.

his relationship with his girlfriend's pre-teen son shows his soft spot and even as she and he break up you know he will keep his eye on the boy. can't wait to watch Season 2.",1419120000,,1126,4.30188679245283

After a few episodes it disintegrated into predictable plot lines. There's a problem. Giovanni (played well by Silvio) steps in to strangle, bludgeon, and shoot some sense into the offender.

The Norwegians, especially the Norwegian police, are portrayed as unrealistically naive, thus allowing the anti-hero to run around unhampered and get away with his assaults, blackmail, etc., gradually imposing his will on everyone in town. This show is clearly intended to be a comedy but essentially teaches that violence and threats of violence are the best way to get along in this world, which is hard to laugh at and, in addition, soon becomes tiresome--the show is a one-trick pony: graft and corruption save the day in episode after episode.

Facts and situations arrive in what is presented as typical Norwegian life and he both reacts and causes reactions that expose US and Norwegian cultural predilections.  The people around him are, at various times, shocked, appalled, overjoyed or stricken.  He represents a mature foreign ego in relation to an overwheening Norwegian superego.  When the constraints of local society become too much, he releases a transcendant American id to bash away at social constructs that are assumed to be solidly anchored to bedrock morality.  The reaction of those who are exposed is where the true joy and humor of the series flows: suddenly feet are not firmly anchored to the ground, they are made of clay and shattered.  Giovanni goes on, unchanged and secure until the next encounter.",1398988800,,883,4.9324324324324325

The dynamics and unlikely mix of USA gangster culture paired with the Norwegian life in a small town is unusual and comical.  Steve Van Zandt and the other actors are really fun to watch and the Norwegian producers certainly poke fun at their own lifestyle and culture. The main character ""solves his problems"" the old fashioned gangster way and one can see that Norway has its share of people and issues that we are all used to in the States, including bureaucrats, hippies, rednecks, drunks, rich developers, criminal elements, etc...

5740750,4,B00CU2QTGU,"I am not a fan of Mafia moves. I didn't watch any of The Godfather movies until sometime in the 2000s and  have never watched a complete episode of The Sopranos

So, when I say I love Lilyhammer, about a Mafioso in the witness protection program, it runs a bit counter to my tastes.

This series  found on Netflix  is a quirky story about the experiences of a Mafioso who  after ratting out his bosses  elects to be relocated via the Federal Witness Protection Program to Lillehammer, Norway.

Why?  Because the area looked nice when he saw it on TV during the Olympics.

Yes, the basic plotline is hackneyed and predictable when viewed from on high. Its the basic fish0-out-of-water story with the character recreating his crime enterprise in an alien environment. Along the way, he raises suspicions of the local police authorities; meets, greets and manipulates the honest and dishonest; beds and impregnates an age-inappropriate woman and is threatened by his former acquaintances.  By the end of the eight episodes, our hero is still around, but a bit worse for wear.

Now, the reason this works lies not just in the quirkiness of the writing and the brilliance of the performers, but in the approach taken to the shows development. This is not a grand and epic statement about the inherent corruptible of mankind. Instead, its a modest effort that takes a well-known premise and delivers it in a wholly entertaining way.

And that is the secret of its success:  it is entertaining.",1396569600,,1487,4.803149606299213

This fish out of water understands Norwegian but speaks English and finds a way to come out on top in even the most trying circumstances.

Very disconcerting, also, for van Zandt to be speaking in his Jersey accent (in English) and having everyone around him responding in Norwegian, with him reacting as if he really understood them and they, him.

He shows up, he's in a nondescript little house with the ashes of his beloved pooch and nothing in the fridge except a frozen pizza. By the time you get to the end of the first season all of that has changed, and it IS extremely reminiscent of Steve Martin's Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli character in ""My Blue Heaven""...he just gets BUSY, making connections, pulling scams, and taking time for a little romance.

Yes, we know it's spelled Lillehammer.  No, it isn't a heavy drama like The Sopranos.  I call it Sopranos lite.  It's very entertaining and I came here to see if I can purchase seasons 1 and 2 on DVD...not yet!

But even more, having always been intrigued by Norway, I enjoyed the authentic Norwegian physical and cultural setting, and apparently the actors are indeed Norwegian.  The series has everything I look for: solid acting, penetrating and diverse depictions of human nature and the human condition, unexpected twists and turns with occasional shock value, a bit of sexual titillation, and lots of laughs.

He's beating up bad guys and bedding girls non-stop.  It just doesn't work.  The ending, when the lady Sheriff consents to covering up a murder, also harms the believability of the series.

Along the way, one must endure endless ""f"" words and worse.  And there is a glaring absence of morality.  Anything goes and nobody cares.  Is that really contemporary Norway?  It is certainly in step with media in this country.  In short, Lillyhammer really isn't worth your time.

5740785,4,B00CU2QTGU,"...I really like this show. I'm only 4 episodes in and if I had to explain all that's happened in those 4 episodes it'd all seem very unlikely and awful to watch. Turns out, this show is quite fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously and most can figure out some of the twists and turns just before they happen, but knowing as much does nothing to degrade interest.

Some quick thoughts:

1. The setting is terrific. It looks like it really was shot in Lilyhammer. It could be Canada for all I know, but it doesn't feel that way. (I know I can easily search the Net for the answer to this but I prefer not being sure.)

2. I'm always searching for a new show to get interested in. Some of my favorites are The Shield, The Wire, Breaking Bad, etc. Possessing such tastes, I figured I'd be a natural fit with Sons of Anarchy. I watched 5 episodes and couldn't take it anymore. The acting was very middle of the road, almost vaudevillian, and too many scenes made me roll my eyes or burst out laughing when they weren't meant to. E.g. The young rider, already forgotten his name, sees a guy sitting on his bike as he exits a convenience store. Take a wild guess what he ends up saying and doing? Yep, he pretends it's cool then roughs the guy over finishing with, ""You never sit on another man's hog."" Oh, it is to laugh. The point is that Lilyhammer at least realizes what it's doing is going to come off as funny and rather than shy from it, it embraces it.

3. Steven Van Zandt make a good fish out of water Mafia type. I'm sure others could play the part but now that he's Frank/ Johnny no one holds a candle. He's really maybe a little too old for the action pieces but one can forgive the producers since 90% of the show is not about action.

4. One HUGE mistake on Netflix's end. The show their logo to open every episode but they don't suggest turning on the subtitle feature. I watched episode one without the subtitles and followed things well enough but once I found the subtitle feature it was obviously a better experience. They should mention this right off for their non-Scandinavian viewers.

Bottom line: Good, off the beaten path, show. Doesn't take itself seriously, which is it's charm.",1388880000,2,2204,4.376528117359413
