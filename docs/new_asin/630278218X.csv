8424710,1,630278218X,"From the moment I popped the Stones component of this video duopoly into my VCR I knew I had made a big mistake. I have watched some pretty degraded videos of otherwise impossible to get hold of rock performances but nothing  matches this for sheer lack of quality. Viewed as if through black muslin  comes badly edited snippets from the Stones appearance on a 1964 Pathe  newsreel interspersed with clips from Peter Whitehead's charming  documentary of the Stones during a 1965 tour of Ireland. Both these items  are in circulation in excellent quality with the Pathe newsreel in glowing  colur as opposed to the murky monochrome of this video. Under these  circumstances the disclainer that due to the rarity of these performances  some portions of the video are regretfully not of the quality that the  distributors of this garbage would wish, is clearly a bit of a put on.  After a few minutes of staring in incomprehension at this miserable tape  and listening to a soundtrack that adds a final touch of condecension to  this whole shoddy enterprise, I gave up in disgust and binned the lot.  Stones fans wishing to see the band at their peak should save their money  and get 25 X 5 an excellent and definitive documentary on the Stones or if  you already have that, then Volume 6 of Hullabaloo is worth a shot for the  lads in top form as they perform ""She Said Yeah"" and ""Get  Off My Cloud"".The Beatles fan is equally well served by the abundance  of material unearthed over the years and both groups featured nearly all  their sixties hits on the Ed Sullivan shows which are all available with  much of the material in glorious colour. Those were the days... and best  remembered by watching decently produced material and not this dross!",946944000,38,1746,4.696369636963697
