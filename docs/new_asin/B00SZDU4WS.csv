I love all the instruction on holding and wielding a sword. Most videos stress the balancing part, but I really wanted to learn both, to build up anticipation and interest. I cannot recommend it enough! She uses a scimitar, giving it a tribal vibe, but I own a straight blade, and her technique is easily adapted. Her bonus features and performances make this video jam-packed with really good stuff, and well worth every penny.",1512432000,,573,4.683168316831683
