7798970,3,1577138368,"The photography of the insects and other ""bug"" species is gorgeous, but the commentary captions are often contradictory to the purpose of enhancing kids' interest in creatures like these. For instance, when the mealworms are featured, the word YUCKY comes onto the screen. Or EEEEEEW comes up another time. The video overall features about a dozen creatures, labels them, and a woman discusses and instructs some kids using voiceovers. The woman has a pleasant, calm, and instructive manner, and the kids insert their realistic comments. It's off the cuff and sort of natural sounding. I would suggest the bugs are shown more often near something to show scale, also. Otherwise, it is a gorgeously photoed video that is mostly helpful.",1357430400,,735,5.133333333333334
7798971,4,1577138368,"This is one of the best introductory videos on insects and other arthropods I have seen. Being an educator of youngsters and known as the local ""Bug Man"" in our small town, I highly recommend this colorful and 'not too deep' look at the world of the small. Yes, it is true that there are only about 20 representative species of ""bugz"" and most of these are native to the Southwest US, but it still has some wonderful close-ups of these beautiful animals engaging their world as our kids (mine included) engage with them. My 6 year old daughter loved this video (especially Rosie the tarantula). Yours should too.",1001635200,,612,4.623853211009174
7798972,2,1577138368,"I got this video because my kids are really into insects. I was  disappointed that they only featured twenty different insects, none of them  in their natural habitat, and only a brief factoid about each. The  voice-over was, I suppose, meant to be a mom chatting with her child about  the bug on the screen, but often the voices were mumbled and indistinct.  The camera work was low-quality and there were no really good close-ups.  However, my kids enjoyed it and have asked to see it again (they are 7 and  9), so that counts for an extra star; I would only have given it one.  Instead of this tape, you might want to opt for ""Microcosmos""  which is way cooler",916272000,2,663,4.413223140495868
