How is it that you DO NOT SHOW the cast under 'product details'?",1100390400,2,122,3.88
2121476,2,B0002V7O56,Mediocre in spite of the fact that it has 2 of my favorite actors (Rod Taylor and Christopher Plummer).  I wish I had been able to rent it instead of purchasing it.,1380844800,,164,4.125
2121477,4,B0002V7O56,"A thoughtful, somewhat complex combination of political intrigue/murder whodunnit with some '60s style spy vs spy thrills thrown in, topped off with an unexpected twist in the decades-old murder case that, impressively, runs concurrent with the main storyline from start to finish, remaining deftly unrelegated to the neglected subplot status it might have suffered in less capable hands.

My only criticism is an extremely mild one: the theme music. While it's a gorgeous, lush and (as another reviewer correctly noted) very melancholy score, it strikes me as suitable for some whole other film, not this one. It seems to portend a great doom that never quite arrives, but does nicely emphasize the sad resolution as the credits roll.",1378080000,,735,5.228813559322034
2121478,4,B0002V7O56,"Good actors in proper roles make a film roll as if in a real life story, and that is how this film felt to me.  Naturally, the two countries represented are Australia, where Scobie Malone, a police detective from the bush, comes to England, to arrest the Australian High Commissioner.  Christopher Plummer plays the role of smooth, handsome and intelligent politician to a tee, and Rod Taylor plays the blunt and sharp-minded Aussie cop perfectly.

It was also a treat to see a color film of 1968 London, with its cars, colorful crowds, especially women in their bright print dresses, at scenes on streets or at Wimbledon Stadium.  We also get to see the interior of beautiful homes and the multicultural parties of the Consulate, full of suave third-world men, mainly Indian and AFrican.

The High Commissioner's latest obsession is ending the great divide between rich and poor nations.  He is holding talks with third-world male leaders to bring about some kind of redistribution scheme, so far as we viewers can understand it, but actual content of these ""talks"" (cocktail parties at someone's expense?) is blurred, obscure.

There is at least one inside leak to the documents, and that is the Commissioner's big worry; it could be his wife (Lilli Palmer), his butler (Clive Revill), his secretary or a close friend.  When Aussie cop comes to arrest him for a long-ago murder of his first wife, it becomes quickly clear to Scobie Maleone that his prisoner is also getting shot at, and someone or some group wants him dead, purportedly to stop these talks.

The movie moves at a very good clip, with never a dull moment, except the silly fling with mulatto socialite played by Daliah Lavi; somehow the idea of a serious cop taking such a risk of losing his prisoner while in bed with a coquette, possibly the murderer herself, seems absurd.  He seems smarter and tougher than that, to fall for any temptation, and he is a mature man, no young silly thing.  He surveys the cocktail parties and spots the suspicious one, who looks like a Romanian gypsy with his eye-liner, and wonders if that one is a Communist.  A big discussion of the role of Communist terrorism in those days does not ensue, but it is implied.

I won't relay all the twists and turns; suffice to say, those who'd like a good cracking story, as the film advertises itself, with great scenes of London in the 1960's, should check this film out.  Surprise ending!!!!",1370908800,,2435,4.752969121140143

2121480,5,B0002V7O56,"This one is a brilliant little time capsule, London in the Sixties, Australia, a New South Wales Premier acting like most of the Aussie pols of the day, Rod Taylor, Australian, as Scobie Malone, Australian cop, based on a book by Jon Cleary, tight little plot that holds together remarkably well, and could have been the base for a wider series of films if they'd thought about it, since the Malone books have been going strong for close on forty years.",1341705600,3,453,4.604938271604938
2121481,3,B0002V7O56,"Aussie cop Scobie Malone (Rod Taylor)is pulled from arresting drunks in the outback Northern Territory, and sent to London to arrest the Australian High Commissioner for the ancient murder of his first wife. Inconvenient, as he is in the middle of saving the world at the UN, so Scobie gets to extend his first-ever visit to Pommieland, conduct a couple of romances, save the H.C. from attacks on his life, and resolve the paradox of the killer in the great man. Interest is enhanced by the question of how his lovely loving second wife will take it all.

Rod Taylor acting as Scobie is as usual uptight, judgemental of everyone, corny and cringeworthy. He's not helped by the script, which shares the last two adjectives. Christopher Plummer, whom I regard as a great actor, does his usual smooth job in a (for him) fairly undemanding role as the H.C., likewise Lilli Palmer who for me is also one of the more delightful acting personalities, always a pleasure to watch.

I give it 3 stars for those who have enough interest in the other features of this ""cracking good story"" (as quoted on the blurb) to tolerate the negative aspects. For general audiences, two stars only would be more appropriate.

The original story was a book by the same name by Australian author Jon Cleary. He must surely have been disappointed (if not cringing and wincing) at the script. If you liked the story, read the book, it's much better. Even then see the movie again, as I did. And try the other Scobie Malone stories, as well as Cleary's others, they're all good.",1295740800,,1550,4.670329670329671
2121482,4,B0002V7O56,"I  really enjoyed THE HIGH COMMISSIONER,  a very good story line, action, suspense and intrigue. I had not seen this movie before, but getting it at such a great price I figured I could not go wrong. A vary good acting performance by both Rod Taylor and Christopher Plummer. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you are a fan of these two actors, you will like this film.",1287705600,2,379,4.478260869565218
2121483,4,B0002V7O56,"Rod Taylor is excellent as the Aussie detective sent to London to arrest an Australian political figure (Christopher Plummer) wanted for murder. Intense, intriguing and set in swinging 60s London, the plot moves along at a great pace with unexpected twists and turns. The Wimbledon Tennis Championships backdrop adds an element of extra interest. Great 60s suspense.",1252713600,2,366,5.43859649122807
2121484,3,B0002V7O56,"This film gets 3 stars as I enjoyed this classy, slow-paced thriller and the good cast. Mostly, though, my biggest pleasure was Georges Delerue's melancholy music score, particularly at the end and in the main title credits.  Unfortunately this print has parts of the title music GARBLED -- UNFORGIVEABLE since this score was never released commercially and cannot be savoured anywhere except on this DVD.  Thumbs down to M-G-M for their careless audio presentation (fortunately I have a home-made DVD from an Australian friend with PRISTINE audio on the main title; couldn't M-G-M get a print from there??)",1130544000,14,607,5.183673469387755
2121485,4,B0002V7O56,"To start with, since the previous reviewer asked - the cast includes:

Rod Taylor as Scobie Malone
Christopher Plummer as Sir James Quentin
Lilli Palmer as Lady Sheila Quentin
Camilla Sparv as Lisa Pretorius
Daliah Lavi as Maria Cholon
Clive Revill as Joseph

And now on to the movie itself - a political thriller set in London in the 1960s, when tensions between East and West were at a dangerous high. The plot revolves around Sir James Quentin, the Australian high commissioner to London, played with elegance and style by Christopher Plummer, who is the chairman of an international conference that attempts to bridge political divides through trade. ""Peace through plenty"" is how one of the conference participants puts it. But although Sir Quentin is quite successful in his negotiations, not all is well. Someone close to him is leaking confidential information, trying to discredit the conference. Shadowy assasins have an eye on the commissioner and the politics around the conference are a tangled web.

On top of that, in the middle of the conference sergeant detective Scobie Malone (a great tough-but-good-guy portrait by Rod Taylor) flies in from Australia, sent by Quentin's political rival, the premier of New South Wales, to arrest him for the alleged murder of his former wife. But did he do it? Malone himself and his boss at the CID don't think so. The inquiry was made by the politically motivated premier's people and not by the CID. However, a mandate of arrest was issued and Malone is supposed to bring the commissioner back to Australia. Quentin asks for more time to finish the conference - a few days that see two assasination attempts, Malone becoming Quentin's private security agent, and endless deception and intrigue, spearheaded by the charming and dangerous Maria Cholon, an underworld queen who has an interest in seeing Quentin dead and the conference aborted. I won't tell you how it all ends because thrillers you know the ending of beforehand aren't that much fun ;).

Although the tone of the movie is mostly serious, there are enough moments of levity provided by the interactions between true-blue Australian Malone and Sir Quentin's stuffy British butler Joseph, delightfully played by Clive Revill. Cast performances are excellent across the board, including Lilli Palmer as Sir Quentin's sensitive, worried wife (Lilli Palmer and Christopher Plummer had played another ill-fated couple before: she had played Jocasta to his Oedipus in ""Oedipus King""). Camilla Sparv plays Sir Quentin's smart, sharp and protective secretary with just the right combination of professionalism and feistiness. Daliah Lavi is suitably langurous, seductive and revengeful as the ""evil beauty"", and Burt Kwouk of ""Pink Panther"" series fame makes an appearance as her lieutenant.

As for the DVD quality, the video is crisp and beautifully toned, much improved over the VHS version which is out of print now (under the name ""Nobody Runs Forever""). The sound is Dolby mono but of good quality.

Based on the novel eponymous novel by Jon Cleary. Recommended!",1101945600,31,3079,5.148
8032377,4,B0002V7O56,"A very nicely done A- thriller starring the often under-rated Rod Taylor as Jon Cleary's Scobie Malone. He and the equally excellent Christopher Plummer play well off each other as, respectively, the unsophisticated NSW (Australia) police sergeant, and the Australian High Commissioner in London. A fine supporting cast includes  Lilli Palmer, Camilla Sparv, Daliah Lavi and Lee Montague as a Scotland Yard detective. As for Derren Nesbitt, it is difficult to tell whether it is his acting or his over-applied eye-make up that is more over-the-top. As for the plot, it is a nice blend of a long-unsolved murder mystery that is now being used by a vindictive NSW Premier (ie State Government leader) to undermine a political rival, and a pseudo-political thriller involving a major conference. Author Jon Cleary was reportedly unhappy with the film because of the changes made to the plot: but in fairness the broad plot-line is well adhered to and the changes involve the adding of extra incidents to make it more ""cinematic"".  I have read the book, and frankly I prefer the film. Not a classic, but very well done.  (Footnote: there was a second (eponymous)  Scobie Malone film, starring Jack Thompson. It should be avoided at all costs.)",1525046400,,1239,5.029268292682927

8032383,5,B0002V7O56,have always enjoyed Rod Taylor and Christopher Plummer. a real bonus seeing them playing side by side. This was a great old movie.
